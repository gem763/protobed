Steam worked for railways and ships, but alas not for cars.\n\nBeaulieu has much to offer even if you're not into vintage automobiles. My wife and I took a short ride in a replica 1912 London double-decker to the ruins of the 13th-century Abbey, once the largest Cistercian building in Britain.\n\nClose by, and past lovely Victorian flower and kitchen gardens, we entered Palace House, home of the Montagu family since 1538. During World War II it was used as a finishing school for Special Operations Executive (SOE) agents. A 'Secret Army' exhibition revealed that one of the trainers was Kim Philby, ironically a secret agent himself.\n\nBeaulieu means 'beautiful place' in French and was the name given to the settlement by the abbey's monks. The village itself is picture-postcard perfect. It has red-bricked buildings and swans sit by the head of the river.\n\nWe stayed in the splendid 17th century Montagu Arms Hotel, where previous guests included Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Lillie Langtry and Charles de Gaulle. One famous 'accidental' diner was an American motorist who got lost. His name: Henry Ford.\n\nNatural delight: Exbury Gardens, four miles from Beaulieu, is celebrating its centenary\n\nIf the food was as good then as now, he was a lucky man as the meal we had in The Terrace restaurant was sublime. I opted for the five-course 'Tasting Menu'. Highlights included the Chalk Stream Trout, with Hampshire watercress, pine nuts and lemon, and the Fillet of Hampshire beef.\n\nLess then four miles away are the utterly magical Exbury Gardens, created by the banker-turned-horticulturalist Lionel de Rothschild, and which celebrates its centenary this year.\n\nThere are more than 200 acres to explore and to help you get around there are buggy rides and also a miniature steam railway, built by Lionel's railway enthusiast son Leo, who, well into his eighth decade, loved to put on his blue boiler suit and take to the footplate.\n\nWe were late for the flowering of the magnificent rhododendrons and azaleas, but we were in time to savour the brilliant blue and pink colours along Hydrangea Walk, surely one of the prettiest woodland paths in the country.\n\nWe came across a little sheltered cemetery with headstones dedicated to the Rothschild family dogs. One was described 'Our dear and faithful friend Jip 1958-72'. Another commemorated 'Scott' 'who really smiled when pleased'.\n\nDriving in the New Forest is a delight and means keeping an eye out for the wild ponies which come right up to the road's edge. The cows do the same.\n\nThe area is great, too, for walking and cycling. We took the footpath to Buckler's Hard, a two-mile route, combining lovely woodland and riverside scenery. Our destination was the 18th century village where Admiral Nelson's Navy ships were built.\n\nIf there is a more fascinating corner of Britain than 'Beautiful Place', I've yet to visit it.", "description": "Beaulieu means 'beautiful place' in French and was the name given to the Hampshire settlement by the abbey's monks.
