The heart and desire and will is unbelievable in those guys.\u201d\n\nThe Braves took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five National League Division Series and will try to close out the set in game four in St. Louis on Monday.\n\n\u2013 \u2018crazy stuff happens\u2019 \u2013\n\nUntil the Braves erupted in the ninth, it was a pitching duel in St. Louis.\n\nAtlanta\u2019s rookie hurler Mike Soroka limited the Cardinals to one run on two hits while striking out seven in his playoff debut.\n\nSt. Louis scored their lone run in the second inning when Marcell Ozuna led off with a double and scored on Matt Carpenter\u2019s sacrifice fly.\n\nWainwright, 38, turned back the clock, pitching 7 2/3 scoreless innings and striking out eight to keep the Cards in front until he exited to a standing ovation but then had to watch from the dugout as the contest slipped away.\n\n\u201cWe were one out away and that is exactly what playoff baseball is all about,\u201d Wainwright said. \u201cJust crazy stuff happens.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 The Los Angeles Dodgers exploded for seven runs in the sixth inning Sunday on the way to a 10-4 victory over the Washington", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/224bf8_dodgers-team-in-major-league-history-score-so-runs-in-one-playoff-inning-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
