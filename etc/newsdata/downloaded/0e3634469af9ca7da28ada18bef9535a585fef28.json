Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks at his gubernatorial campaign\u2019s primary night watch party in San Francisco, Tuesday, June 5, 2018. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)\n\nHere\u2019s a strange bit of legislation.\n\nOn Tuesday, California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill freeing citizens from the obligation to help cops who need help making an arrest.\n\nSB 192\u2019s sponsor, Democratic state Sen. Bob Hertzberg, told The Sacramento Bee it repeals the California Posse Comitatus Acto of 1872. According to Bob, the old law\u2019s a \u201cvestige of a bygone era\u201d that forces \u201can untenable moral dilemma\u201d for folks.\n\nFrom the bill:\n\nExisting law makes an able-bodied person 18 years of age or older who neglects or refuses to join the posse comitatus or power of the county, by neglecting or refusing to aid and assist, as described, in making an arrest, retaking into custody a person who has escaped from arrest or imprisonment, or preventing a breach of the peace or the commission of any criminal offense, after being lawfully required by a uniformed peace officer or a judge, guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to punishment by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $1,000. This bill would repeal that provision and make conforming changes.\n\nThe state Sheriff\u2019s Association wasn\u2019t much for the law, and they made it known via a statement:\n\nThere are situations in which a peace officer might look to private persons for assistance in matters of emergency or risks to public safety and we are unconvinced that this statute should be repealed.\n\nBut what if the command puts the person in danger?\n\nIt certainly could. As reported by the Bee, a couple claims it did:\n\nThe law was cited as recently as 2014, when the Trinity County Sheriff\u2019s Office invoked posse comitatus in its defense during a lawsuit filed by a man and woman alleging they were deceived into responding to a dangerous 911 call on the office\u2019s behalf.\n\nPersonally, I find both things strange \u2014 that there\u2019s a bill aggressively freeing the public from cooperating with cops in need during an arrest, and also the fact that there was a law demanding the opposite which necessitated it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is this a wise correction, or just the latest rise out of wacky California?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you in the Comments section.\n\n-ALEX\n\nSee 3 more pieces from me:\n\nWATCH: Wild Viral Video Shows Lone Cop Fight Two Rowdies At The Beach.
