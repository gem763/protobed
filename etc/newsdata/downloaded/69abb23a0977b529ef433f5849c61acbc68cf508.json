Her efforts were largely applauded by local Indigenous groups.\n\nUK expresses 'regret' over M\u0101ori killings after Cook's arrival in New Zealand Read more\n\nThe New Zealand government has avoided engaging with protesters, who say state-funded celebrations of Cook\u2019s landings rankle as the sailor didn\u2019t \u201cdiscover\u201d New Zealand, as often claimed, and their ancestors lost their lives in the initial encounter, as well as their sovereignty.\n\nA flotilla of ships \u2013 including a replica of Cook\u2019s Endeavour \u2013 is scheduled to dock in Gisborne on Saturday, and will be greeted by Ardern.\n\nA statue of Cook in Gisborne has been repeatedly vandalised, with the words \u201cThis is our land\u201dand \u201cThief Pakeha [white person]\u201d spray-painted on.\n\nTen thousand people are expected to attend commemoration events but indigenous rights advocate Tina Ngata says the anniversary should instead be used for reflection.\n\nLast month, she told Radio New Zealand that Cook was \u201ca murderer, he was an invader [and] he was a vanguard for British imperial expansion\u201d.\n\nIn other parts of the country, M\u0101ori tribes have refused to allow the replica Endeavour to dock.\n\n'He's a barbarian': M\u0101ori tribe bans replica of Captain Cook's ship from port Read more\n\nAnahera Herbert-Graves, the head of Northland\u2019s Ng\u0101ti Kahu iwi, or tribe, told RNZ: \u201cHe [Cook] was a barbarian. Wherever he went, like most people of the time of imperial expansion, there were murders, there were abductions, there were rapes, and just a lot of bad outcomes for the indigenous people.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t discover anything down here, and we object to Tuia 250 [flotilla of commemoration ships] using euphemisms like \u2018encounters\u2019 and \u2018meetings\u2019 to disguise what were actually invasions.\u201d\n\nArdern has reserved Sunday as a day to meet Iwi groups and canvas their thoughts and feelings about the contentious issue. But her deputy Winston Peters has inflamed the situation by claiming M\u0101ori were not \u201cblameless\u201d, according to the New Zealand Herald.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard some comment from some M\u0101ori who don\u2019t seem to realise that their own track record \u2013 and being from Nga Puhi I can say this \u2013 has not been as pure as the driven snow,\u201d he said.", "description": "Critics say government should not be funding events to commemorate 250th anniversary due to sensitivity to M\u0101ori", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2964f0eec7ea93dc1c87d206e701357ff00ad8ab/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e6c66227042e4e444adfbb4536d505de", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
