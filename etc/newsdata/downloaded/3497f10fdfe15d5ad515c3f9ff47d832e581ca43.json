Despite the known episodes of firms misusing data, the ease and quality of life under the reign of Big Tech generally seems worth it.\u201d No way that Pandey is some freakish exception.\n\nIf we really are rejecting our tech overlords \u2014 and thus the notion that the government should crimp all their business models and/or break them up \u2014 shouldn\u2019t there be some significant sign of that rejection other than a few public polls? Especially if those polls give no sense of the inevitable trade-offs that come with government action? For instance: A new survey finds two-thirds of Americans want to break up companies like Amazon and Google when told doing so ensures \u201cmore competition in the future.\u201d Hey, who doesn\u2019t like competition? But would break-ups be so popular if the respondents were told they might lead to higher prices, worse service, less research investment \u2014 and maybe less ability to fight off foreign rivals?\n\nOther polls find we have lots of privacy concerns \u2014 yet we won\u2019t update privacy settings on an app or use two-step authentication for our Gmail or connect through VPNs. There are plenty of privacy oriented alternatives \u2014 such as the DuckDuck Go search engine and Brave browser \u2014 that we pretty much ignore. Then there\u2019s the recent survey that found the five most popular brands among Millennials were Netflix, Google, Amazon, YouTube, and Target. Among GenZ: Google, Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, and Oreo. We don\u2019t just grudgingly like their products of these companies, we kind of like the companies themselves.", "description": "", "authors": ["James Pethokoukis", "Theweek.Com Articles Backlash-Tech-Backlash"], "top_image": ""}
