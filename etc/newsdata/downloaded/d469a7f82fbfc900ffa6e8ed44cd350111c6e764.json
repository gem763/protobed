Trump appears to be counting on that confusion to offer a fog of claims and allegations to make it appear as if Biden had done something wrong. So here\u2019s a quick guide to Trump\u2019s statements \u2014 and the truth.\n\nBiden pushed out a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating his son\n\nTrump has falsely claimed that Biden in 2015 pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor, because he was investigating Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, Burisma, which had added Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, to its board in 2014.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are two big problems with this claim: One, Shokin was not investigating Burisma or Hunter Biden, and two, Shokin\u2019s ouster was considered a diplomatic victory.\n\nBiden was among the many Western officials who pressed for the removal of Shokin because he actually was not investigating the corruption endemic to the country. Indeed, he was not investigating Burisma at the time. In September 2015, then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt publicly criticized Shokin\u2019s office for thwarting a British money-laundering probe into Burisma\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky.\n\n\u201cShokin was not investigating. He didn\u2019t want to investigate Burisma,\u201d Daria Kaleniuk, of the Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Center, told The Washington Post in July. \u201cAnd Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a 2018 appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations, Biden bragged about his role in Shokin\u2019s removal, saying he had withheld $1 billion in loan guarantees as leverage to force action. But Biden was carrying out a policy developed at the State Department and coordinated with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe Ukrainian prosecutor was regarded as a failure, and \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s efforts to oust Shokin were universally praised,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist heavily involved in Eastern European market reforms. Getting rid of Shokin was considered the linchpin of reform efforts, but U.S. officials had a list of changes the government needed to make before it could obtain another loan guarantee.\n\nIn December 2015, Biden traveled to Kiev and decried the \u201ccancer of corruption\u201d in the country in a speech to the parliament. \u201cThe Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform,\u201d he noted. Shokin was removed from office three months later, and Biden announced April 15 that the loan guarantee would go forward; the agreement between the United States and Ukraine was signed June 3.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne can certainly raise questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s judgment in joining Burisma\u2019s board at a time his father had a high-profile role in working with Ukraine\u2019s government. But by continuing to claim that Biden \u201cdid\u201d something for his son, Trump persists in spreading a false narrative about a diplomatic maneuver hailed at the time as a step toward reducing corruption in Ukraine.\n\nHunter Biden made a killing on a China deal\n\nAt various times Trump has claimed Hunter Biden \u201cmade millions of dollars from China\u201d or \u201cwalks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund\u201d after hitching a ride with his father on Air Force Two. But there is no evidence to support those statements.\n\nAD\n\nIn December 2013, Hunter Biden and one of his daughters flew from Japan to China with Joe Biden on Air Force Two as the vice president embarked on a diplomatic mission.\n\nAD\n\nTwelve days after he flew to Beijing, Hunter Biden joined an advisory board of a fund called BHR Partners, which had announced it would try to raise $1.5 billion. The New Yorker magazine reported that during the trip Hunter Biden arranged for his father to shake hands with Jonathan Li, who ran a Chinese private-equity fund and was one of the partners who had formed BHR.\n\nBut while Joe Biden was vice president, Hunter Biden was only on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did. George Mesires, a lawyer for Hunter Biden, said he only took an equity stake in 2017, after Joe Biden was longer vice president.\n\nAD\n\nMesires told The Fact Checker that the investment management company \u201cwas capitalized from various sources with a total of 30 million RMB [Chinese Renminbi], or about $4.2 million, not $1.5 billion.\u201d Because Biden acquired a 10 percent minority interest, his \u201ccapital commitment is approximately $420,000,\u201d Mesires said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors,\u201d Mesires added.\n\nBiden lied about talking to his son\n\nAfter the reports on Hunter Biden\u2019s business deals emerged, Joe Biden told reporters: \u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump claimed that this was a lie because \u201che\u2019s already said he spoke to his son.\u201d But Biden had not. Instead, Trump appeared to be referring to a line in the New Yorker profile: \u201cAs Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: \u2018Dad said, \u201cI hope you know what you are doing,\u201d and I said, \u201cI do.\u201d \u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not much of a discussion. In any case, Biden never said he spoke to his son, as Trump claimed he did.\n\nDemocratic senators also threatened Ukraine\u2019s aid\n\nTrump claimed that three Democratic senators \u2014 Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), Richard J. Durbin (Ill.) and Robert Menendez (N.J.) \u2014 \u201cimplied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn\u2019t do the right thing they wouldn\u2019t get any assistance.\u201d He later referred to \u201csenators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump suggested this was the \u201creal deal,\u201d unlike allegations that he held up military aid to force the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens.\n\nTrump is referring to a letter written in 2018, and it does not say what he claims.\n\nThe letter, written to the special prosecutor at the time, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressed concern about a New York Times report that Ukraine had stopped cooperating with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to avoid upsetting Trump. The letter does not threaten a loss of aid, though it notes that the Times article said that the freezing of cooperation was motivated by a worry that Trump would cut off aid. (The article was titled: \u201cUkraine, Seeking U.S. Missiles, Halted Cooperation with Mueller Investigation.\u201d)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe letter noted the signers have supported efforts to build Ukraine\u2019s democracy and expressed \u201cdisappointment\u201d that some lawmakers in Kiev were trying \u201cto avoid the ire of President Trump.\u201d The senators then ask a series of questions, seeking to clarify whether the Times report was correct and whether the Trump administration had encouraged the government not to cooperate with Mueller.\n\nLutsenko never responded. Since the letter was sent, the three senators have voted for nearly $870 million in additional aid to Ukraine, with Leahy and Durbin (members of the Senate Appropriations Committee) voting in committee on Sept. 26 for an additional $448 million in fiscal 2020, an increase over 2018 and 2019.\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "description": "The president keeps making the same allegations over and over.
