The AfD nearly tripled its share of the vote since elections five years ago while the CDU lost almost 7% of its support.\n\nIn Brandenburg, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) continued to hold the state with 26.2% of the vote, even as the party lost more than 5% of its support compared with five years ago. The AfD won 23.5% of the vote, nearly doubling its share over the previous election.\n\nTurnout was significantly higher than in the 2014 elections. In Saxony, 65% of eligible voters went to the polls, compared with about 49% five years ago, according to estimates from pollster Infratest dimap. In Brandenburg, turnout slightly topped 60%, compared with 47.9% in the previous elections.\n\nAs results trickled in, the leaders of Germany\u2019s establishment parties conceded they had much work to do in light of the results.\n\n\u201cA few weeks ago, the far right was ahead [of us]. But today, there was clear pushback against the AfD; most don\u2019t want the AfD to be the strongest party,\u201d said SPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil. \u201cNevertheless, these election results are still far too high\u201d in support for them.\n\nMeanwhile, the AfD, expressing satisfaction with the results, said it showed that voters were \u201cpunishing\u201d the establishment parties and vowed to press on.\n\n\u201cYes, we have not become the strongest force \u2014 there is still some missing pieces. And now, the real work begins,\u201d AfD co-Chairman Alexander Gauland told German broadcaster ARD. \u201cWe won\u2019t move the discourse to the right but toward reason.\u201d\n\nEven before Sunday, the long dominance of Germany\u2019s centrist parties was showing serious cracks.\n\nThe SPD for years has been a reluctant coalition partner at best, dragging its heels after the 2017 elections in agreeing to join Ms. Merkel in another \u201cgrand coalition,\u201d as activists complained that the alliance was steadily dragging down the party\u2019s popularity.\n\nAs the CDU moves more toward the left, it leaves a vacuum that the AfD has rushed to fill.\n\nThe AfD, which was formed in 2013 as a group that opposed Germany\u2019s policies toward the euro crisis, surged in support, especially in the formerly communist east, because of its staunch anti-immigrant stands. By 2017, it had won seats in 14 out of 16 state parliaments and in the federal government for the first time. Even so, its power has been limited. It usually wins 10% to 15% of the vote, and none of the establishment parties will work with the AfD.\n\nComing just before the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in November, the state elections \u2014 as well as one in the eastern state of Thuringia in October \u2014 underscore the divide that lingers between the east and the west, and in some cases nostalgia for communist East Germany.\n\nStill dealing with the collapse of major industries and markets after the Berlin Wall fell, many easterners express frustration and anger at Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats for opening the door to 1 million refugees in 2015, mostly from Arab and African countries.\n\nThe AfD has run on a platform of more investment in education and infrastructure, more deportations of foreigners, a ban on mosques with minarets and less \u201cappeasement of foreigners.\u201d\n\nSome of the resentment, analysts say, comes from a feeling of missing out. In spite of billions of dollars in transfer payments from the federal government since reunification in 1991, investment in infrastructure and the emergence of business hubs in cities such as Dresden, many in the east feel they didn\u2019t benefit as Germany powered ahead in the 2000s to become the continent\u2019s economic engine. Wages remain lower than in the east, and certain professionals such as doctors remain lacking.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense that people in the east haven\u2019t done so well and feel left behind,\u201d said Matthias Lang, a lawyer with Bird & Bird in Dusseldorf. \u201cWhether that\u2019s true or not is a different question. But it\u2019s clear that the AfD\u2019s support is higher in areas where people feel this way.\u201d\n\nHe said any surges of support for the AfD will just make it harder for Germany\u2019s eastern regions to attract more investment and raise its living standards.\n\n\u201cIf you are an investor and you are watching things not going well in a region, then you may be less likely to invest there, and this in turn will not make the situation better in that area, which will lead to continued unhappiness,\u201d said Mr. Lang. \u201cBut where you have a real problem is where there is unwillingness by the population to have foreigners. Then as a foreign company, you would certainly look elsewhere to invest.\u201d\n\nIngo Kramer, president of the Confederation of German Employers\u2019 Associations (BDA), expressed concern over AfD gains in the two state elections.\n\n\u201cThe relative strength of the AfD in Saxony and Brandenburg causes us employers increasing concern, as the verbal statements of top AfD officials are likely to damage the positive reputation of international business in these states,\u201d he told German media. \u201cBoth state leaders must understand their clear personal electoral success as a mission to form a government that strengthens the economy and thus improves people\u2019s living standards more than it has done so far.\u201d\n\nThe elections in Saxony and Brandenburg have been watched with growing concern in much of the rest of the country. Because of Germany\u2019s Nazi past, many don\u2019t want to see a party many associate with racism, and downplaying that legacy makes surges in the east.\n\nIn Dresden last month, thousands hit the streets in protest.\n\n\u201cI am panicked that the AfD could win,\u201d said Maria, a teacher in Berlin, 45, who votes for The Left Party. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t believe it that this could actually become a reality.\u201d\n\nRegardless, the elections underscore a division in Germany that exists and continues to grow across Europe and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThirty years after the fall of the Wall, our homeland is more divided than ever,\u201d Die Welt Editor-in-Chief Ulf Poschardt said in an editorial. \u201cThere is no desire to build a road between the two sides. And there is a lack of ideas that could bring together the different factions in the country.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
