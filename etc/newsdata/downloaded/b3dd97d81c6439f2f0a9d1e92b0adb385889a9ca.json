Matt Miller says that while the Apple Watch is a great smartwatch, there are many other wearables focused on helping you collect data and use it to improve your health and fitness.

Apple's Watch product, Samsung's Galaxy Watch line, and Huawei's Watch range are all competing for a slice of the market, and as this rivalry escalates, analysts expect prices to drop.\n\nSee also: Why your smartwatch and wearable devices are the next big privacy nightmare\n\nThis may not impact premium models, such as those offered by Apple and Samsung, but for others -- including Huawei and Xiaomi -- prices decreasing by roughly 4.5 percent across 2020 and 2021 could bolster spending patterns.\n\n\"While brand leaders, Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch command premium pricing in the smartwatch segment, lower-priced players such as Xiaomi and Huawei will counterbalance high-priced smartwatches with lower cost smartwatches,\" says Ranjit Atwal, senior research director at Gartner.\n\nCNET: Fitbit stock surges on report that Google parent Alphabet may buy company\n\nWhile smartwatches and HMDs secure the top positions in terms of spending, likely due to their generally high price points, smartwatches and ear-worn devices secured the highest positions in terms of estimated shipments.\n\nIn 2020, smartwatch shipments are predicted to reach 86 million units, whereas ear-worn gadgets will reach 70 million units worldwide, dominated by Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, and Bose.\n\nAccording to Gartner, it is not just sliding price points that will influence the market in the future. As our sensors improve and become smaller, so-called \"miniaturization\" will also spur growth.\n\nTechRepublic: IDC: Why hearables are the new wearables\n\nMiniaturization of sensors, able to fit in health-related gadgets and smart clothing, will \"enable device makers to integrate sensors that can track sleep or medical conditions into wearables that are almost invisible to end-users,\" the agency says.\n\nIn turn, consumers that are reluctant to use wearable technology which is too conspicuous may be enticed into purchasing new devices. It is expected that by 2023, ten percent of all wearables are predicted to be unobtrusive and difficult to spot.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
