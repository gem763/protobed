As a result, it was not immediately clear if the Vatican made any determination about the abuse allegation.\n\nFor decades, the Vatican turned a blind eye to bishops and cardinals who raped and molested children and adults or covered up the crimes.\n\nIt was Dolan's archdiocese that received complaints about sexual misconduct by ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, cases that launched a new reckoning in the US Catholic Church hierarchy.", "description": "Auxiliary Bishop John Jenik denied the allegation when it was first brought to the New York City archdiocese last year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/10/cb9a793f56cc4f5ea154fcc4875a1848_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
