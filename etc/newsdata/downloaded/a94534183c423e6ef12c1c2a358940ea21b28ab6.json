You needed to wire power and connectivity to the cameras, dig trenches or run wiring for the lights, and then rig up a system to control and monitor it all.\n\nRing\u2019s latest products this year address those challenges head-on: they are inexpensive, easy to install, and run on batteries or even solar so you don\u2019t have to run wiring to them at all. Ring has had battery-operated doorbells for a few years, but now, it has a whole suite of products that require no wiring and very little work to install.\n\nFor the past few weeks, I\u2019ve been testing Ring\u2019s Stick Up Cam, Smart Lighting, and Peephole Cam, each of which addresses a different need depending on your situation. If you\u2019ve been wanting to install security lighting and cameras in your home, it\u2019s never been easier than now.\n\nRing Stick Up Cam\n\nThe $179 Stick Up Cam Battery is a battery-powered connected security camera, complete with motion alerts, full HD resolution, and night vision. It can be mounted almost anywhere inside or outside of your home in just minutes.\n\nRing has come under a lot of criticism this year over privacy concerns with its products and its Neighbors app, with reports claiming that customer videos were transmitted without encryption to Ring\u2019s cloud service and viewed by Ring employees on its R&D team. The Neighbors app, which lets Ring device owners share video clips and report possible crimes, has been criticized for making crimes appear more prevalent than they actually are and feeding into existing biases and racism. Ring, which is owned by Amazon, says it \u201cdoes not provide and never has provided employees with access to livestreams of Ring devices,\u201d and the Neighbors app \u201cis meant to facilitate this collaboration within communities by allowing users to easily share and communicate with their neighbors and in some cases, local law enforcement, about crime and safety in real-time.\u201d The company says that it does review and annotate clips in an effort to improve the product, but those clips are \u201csourced exclusively from publicly shared Ring videos from the Neighbors app (in accordance with our terms of service), and from a small fraction of Ring users who have provided their explicit written consent to allow us to access and utilize their videos for such purposes.\u201d Ring\u2019s products don\u2019t function very well without uploading data and video clips to its cloud service, so if that\u2019s something you\u2019re concerned about, they might not be the right devices for you.\n\nOne of the more clever things about the Stick Up Cam is its flexible, built-in stand, which lets you either place it on a shelf or mantle inside or invert it and quickly install it under an awning outside with just three screws, as I\u2019ve done. It can also be positioned to mount the camera flat against a wall.\n\nFrom there, the Stick Up Cam behaves very similarly to Ring\u2019s popular video doorbells: it connects to your home Wi-Fi network, records clips and provides push alerts to your phone when it detects motion, and has a two-way microphone and speaker so you can communicate with someone who is in front of the camera with your phone or Amazon Echo Show. You can customize the range for the motion detection as well as the time of day when you\u2019ll get alerts so you don\u2019t get pinged all day long if it\u2019s near a busy entryway. Ring\u2019s app provides a way to view clips that are captured by the camera as well as adjust its motion detection and alert settings. The Stick Up Cam allows you to get motion alerts, view the live feed, and use the two-way communication features out of the box. But to review any recordings, you\u2019ll need to pay for Ring\u2019s Protect cloud service, which starts at $3 per month or $30 per year.\n\nI mounted the Stick Up Cam above a deck on the side of my house, which seems to make the most sense for this kind of product. I can have it monitor an entryway \u2014 the door to my deck \u2014 without the need to install a full doorbell that won\u2019t ever be used. The Stick Up Cam uses the same battery as the Ring Video Doorbell and Video Doorbell 2, and in my testing, it should last about three months between charges. Ring also sells a wired version of the Stick Up Cam and one that comes with a solar panel, but both of those require more complicated installs. Changing the battery doesn\u2019t even require taking the camera down from its mount, but if you\u2019re putting in a spot that\u2019s way high up and hard to reach, you might want to consider just getting the wired version and deal with the extra install process at the beginning.\n\nSmart Lighting\n\nThe new Smart Lighting line is Ring\u2019s first product of this kind, coming from the company\u2019s acquisition of lighting company Mr Beams. Simplified, the Smart Lighting line is a set of exterior lights and motion detectors for your home that are connected to the internet, so you can manage them and get notifications from them in the Ring app. They function a lot like Ring\u2019s various outdoor cameras, without the whole camera part.\n\nThe line includes floodlights, spotlights, a light to mount on steps, a motion detector, and pathlights for a walkway. All of the lights can run on battery power and wirelessly communicate with the necessary $49.99 Smart Lighting Bridge to connect them to the internet through your home Wi-Fi network. There\u2019s also a transformer that can be installed on existing landscape lighting to connect that to Ring\u2019s system.\n\nI\u2019ve been testing the Pathlights, which are available in a two-pack with the Bridge included for $79.99 or standalone for $29.99, as well as the $24.99 Smart Lighting Motion Sensor. The Pathlights actually have motion sensors built into them, so they don\u2019t need the secondary sensor, but if you want to trigger them from farther distances or around blind corners, the motion sensor can do that wirelessly.\n\nThe Pathlights run on four D-cell batteries for up to a year, according to Ring, and they provide 360 degrees of lighting. You can adjust the brightness, timeout duration, and when they turn on and off through the Ring app.\n\nSetting up the Smart Lighting system can be done in just a few minutes\n\nThe Smart Lighting system is easy to set up \u2014 you do it all through the Ring app, and it can be up and running in minutes \u2014 and requires no wiring or time-consuming installation process. But compared to standard motion-sensing lights you can buy, they are expensive. The real worth of the Smart Lighting system is found when it\u2019s paired with Ring\u2019s other products, like the video doorbells or cameras. You can use the motion detectors on the Smart Lighting products to trigger mobile alerts or the cameras to start recording clips, or you can control them with voice commands to Amazon\u2019s Alexa assistant.\n\nSince I didn\u2019t really need to use the Motion Sensor to turn on the lights, I stuck it in my mailbox (about 70 feet from where I have the bridge set up in my living room) and set it to give me push alerts whenever it detected motion. This has reliably worked to let me know when the mail has arrived and has been more reliable than the Zigbee contact sensors I\u2019ve used in the past for the same purpose. Ring says it is using a proprietary RF protocol to connect the lights to the bridge, which provides longer distances and more reliable connectivity.\n\nOverall, the Smart Lighting system\u2019s value is in its ease of use and expansive connectivity. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find another connected lighting system that\u2019s this accessibly priced and easy to install.\n\nPeephole Cam\n\nRing is perhaps best known for its video doorbells, which let you get alerts when the bell is rung, see who\u2019s at your door, and speak to them through your phone. But even though it has an extensive line of wired and battery operated versions, none of those are particularly useful for apartment dwellers.\n\nThat\u2019s where the $199 Peephole Cam (formerly Door View Cam) comes in. It\u2019s basically a Ring Video Doorbell 2 that can be mounted on the peephole of a door without damaging the door itself. You can remove the Peephole Cam when you move out and replace the original peephole without leaving a mark.\n\nThe Peephole Cam is basically a Ring Video Doorbell 2 that can fit in a standard peephole\n\nMuch like the Video Doorbell 2, the Peephole Cam is a 1080p camera with night vision and motion detection. It runs on a rechargeable battery (the same one as the Stick Up Cam and Ring\u2019s other video doorbells), and it allows for two-way communication through your phone.\n\nCleverly, the Peephole Cam preserves the ability to look through the peephole to see who\u2019s there, so you don\u2019t have to pull your phone out just to see who\u2019s on the other side of the door. There\u2019s also a cover on the inside of the door to prevent someone from looking back through it at you.\n\nRing says it takes as few as five minutes to install the Peephole Cam. Based on my testing with a demo door, I agree, provided your door\u2019s thickness is between 34mm (about 1.3 inches) and 55mm (about 2.2 inches). The Peephole Cam comes with all of the tools and hardware you need to set it up.\n\nLike the other video doorbells Ring makes, you can adjust the zones for motion detection on the Peephole Cam, which can help prevent false triggers if there\u2019s a lot of foot traffic in front of your door. It\u2019s also possible to configure \u201cprivacy zones,\u201d which will prevent the camera from recording areas you specify, such as a neighbor\u2019s entryway.\n\nAt $200, the Peephole Cam is a little harder to justify compared to Ring\u2019s more permanent video doorbells, as it is only really useful to apartment dwellers who have regular visitors at their door and not ones with an external buzzer or lobby in their building. But it does provide an option for those who can\u2019t use a traditional video doorbell that requires a permanent installation.\n\nThe overarching theme with Ring\u2019s product releases this year is ease of installation and use. You can get other video doorbells (though you\u2019ll have a hard time finding another option that works on batteries), security cameras, and landscape / security lighting for a lot less than what Ring charges, but you\u2019ll likely have to deal with much more complicated wiring power and connectivity, if connectivity is even an option. And then you won\u2019t have the integration across the whole system that Ring is offering. Ring\u2019s combination of wire-free installation and integration across its entire line of products is tough to beat, even if it does cost more at the outset.\n\nUpdate, 7:45PM ET, October 8th, 2019: Since the original publication of this article, Ring has changed the name of the Door View Cam to the Peephole Cam. It is otherwise the same product, but now with a name that makes a bit more sense. We\u2019ve updated the references to the device throughout.\n\nPhotography by Dan Seifert / The Verge", "description": "Ring\u2019s new products all have a similar theme: you don\u2019t need to do any wiring to install them.
