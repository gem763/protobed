So, I think that's a hugely positive thing that people are missing.\"\n\nHe noted that Britain's unemployment rate has remained low and wages have been rising \u2014 which indicate the economy is in a good standing.\n\nA no-deal Brexit \u2014 which refers to the U.K. leaving the EU without a trade agreement \u2014 is seen by many in Parliament as a scenario to be avoided at all costs. Without a deal, the Bank of England will likely ease monetary policy to support the economy, Baur said.\n\nThe U.K.'s potential trade deals with the U.S., Canada and Japan could also help to keep the economy going, he added.\n\nHowever, many other economists are far less optimistic than Baur about Britain's prospects following a no-deal Brexit. Analysts from Citi wrote in a report last week that gross domestic product in the U.K. would \"flat-line\" for two years if the country leaves the EU without an agreement.", "description": "Uncertainties over how the U.K. would leave the European Union have sent the British pound down by around 5% this year.", "authors": ["Yen Nee Lee"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106110157-1567567420085gettyimages-1165887103.jpeg?v=1567567561"}
