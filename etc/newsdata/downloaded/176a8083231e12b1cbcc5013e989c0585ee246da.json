Beijing said it hopes for \"substantive progress\" during talks next month.\n\nIn the U.S., futures on the S&P 500 rose 0.8%.\n\nAsian stocks soared on the prospect of fresh negotiations, as well as hopes for monetary easing in China. Stocks in Japan and South Korea, both of whose economies have been sensitive to the trade dispute, shot higher, with the Nikkei 225 up 2.1% and the Kospi up 0.8%. The Shanghai Composite rose 0.9%.\n\n\"Markets spent all of August looking for a catalyst,\" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading firm IG Group, noting that trading volumes were higher after a summer lull.\n\nIpek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at London Capital Group, said that despite the October U.S.-China meeting, there isn't a market expectation that it will lead to an immediate resolution. In addition to the exchange of goods, the U.S. and China also have to reconcile concerns about patents and access to the internet, which the Chinese government censors.\n\n\"Investors are not expecting anything to happen soon. What investors are afraid of is another abrupt halt in trade negotiations,\" she said.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng was flat, holding on to the previous day's gains that came after the city's leader withdrew the extradition bill that had caused months of unrest.\n\nChina's state media, citing Wednesday remarks from a meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang, said the government plans to use monetary policy, including cuts to banks' reserve requirement ratios, to stimulate the economy and support small enterprises.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.6%, while Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 both rose 0.8%.\n\nGains in the Europe were led by the auto and technology sectors. France's Dassault Aviation's shares gained 8.1% after it reported a jump in first-half net profit and maintained its 2019 targets. Shares in Melrose Industries also rose 5.8% after the industrial-turnaround specialist improved margins and said cost-cutting was protecting its automotive arm against an industry downturn.\n\nThe U.K.'s FTSE 100 edged down 0.4% as the pound climbed 0.2% against the dollar, with sterling recovering from earlier losses this week on Brexit uncertainty. A weaker pound makes British exports more competitive and boosts the value, in sterling terms, of money earned abroad, said David Madden, a market analyst for CMC Markets. Many components in the U.K. index have substantial international exposure.\n\nThe U.S. is in the middle of introducing 15% levies on about $270 billion worth of mostly consumer items from China. It also plans to raise tariffs on largely nonconsumer items -- materials businesses use to produce goods -- to 30% from 25%.\n\nChina has retaliated, hitting items such as American soybeans and some U.S. auto parts with higher punitive tariffs of 30% and 35%. It is also letting the Chinese yuan depreciate to help mitigate the impact of the levies.\n\nMajor U.S. retailers including Target, Walmart, Dollar Tree and others that are large importers of Chinese goods have been affected by the tariffs.\n\nIn bonds, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.515% from 1.456% Wednesday afternoon. The 10-year German bund yield also crept higher despite weaker-than-expected manufacturing orders data released for July. The data is likely to reinforce expectations for stimulus measures to be announced by the European Central Bank next week. The 10-year bund yield was trading at minus 0.627%, up from minus 0.670% on Wednesday. Yields rise when bond prices fall.\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude oil rose 0.3% to $60.88 a barrel. Gold fell 0.6%.\n\nLater Thursday, figures for the number of Americans applying for first-time unemployment benefits will be released, as will August numbers for the ISM non-manufacturing index, which shows business conditions in the U.S. non-manufacturing sector.\n\nJoanne Chiu contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 05, 2019 06:18 ET (10:18 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
