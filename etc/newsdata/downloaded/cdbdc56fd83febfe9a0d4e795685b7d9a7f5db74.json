But you should deal with them separately.'\n\nAsked if he would advocate a referendum on the same day as an election he added: 'I'd advocate it if it was the only way of resolving it.'\n\nHe also said Remain supporters had to accept that No Deal must be on the ballot paper in any referendum.\n\nHe said a three-question referendum was therefore 'the sensible thing to do'.\n\nThe former leader urged Labour to ensure a No Deal Brexit is ruled out completely, and not only until January - including if upcoming EU trade talks turn 'ugly' - before agreeing to an election.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour, due to be broadcast this evening, Mr Blair said: 'You can deal with them both on the same day if you want. But you should deal with them separately'\n\nThe three-time election winner for Labour made the audacious suggestion as he backed successor Jeremy Corbyn's refusal to back a new vote while a No Deal Brexit is still possible\n\nThe Prime Minister is due to ask MPs on Monday to give him a general election on December 12.\n\nHe requires, under the Fixed-Terms Parliament Act, a two-thirds Commons majority, making Labour the linchpin in approving a pre-Christmas polling date.\n\nBut Mr Blair said, even if the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) ends up being signed off by Parliament, the future negotiations with Brussels over a post-Brexit trading arrangement were likely to end in a no-deal scenario.\n\nMr Johnson's deal has agreed terms over a divorce payment to the EU, rights for EU citizens living in Britain and how to avoid a hard border in Ireland.\n\nIf ratified, the UK will enter into a transition period until December 2020 where it will continue to obey European rules while a new trading agreement is thrashed out.\n\nShould a trade deal prove elusive, Britain could be forced to revert to World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms with the EU - known more commonly as no-deal.\n\nMr Blair told BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour: 'The sensible thing for him (Mr Corbyn) to say to Boris Johnson is, 'Yes, I'll agree to your general election, but you've got to agree to timetable proper scrutiny of your Bill and allow us to amend that so that we rule out no-deal as the outcome of the future negotiation'.\n\n'Because otherwise Jeremy Corbyn hasn't prevented no-deal. He can make that happen.\n\n'He can say, the moment that's done properly, he's up for a general election. But it's got to encompass the future negotiations and not simply the exit deal.'\n\nThe EU is considering an extension to Article 50 after Mr Johnson, acting on the Benn Act, asked leaders for a delay until January 31.\n\nMr Blair, who won three general elections, said any short-term extension would only postpone the threat of no-deal until the trade negotiations start up.\n\nMr Johnson wants a free trade deal with the EU but Mr Blair said a no-deal outcome was the most likely option.\n\n'Europe is now on notice from Britain and its ministers that Britain wants Brexit to compete around tax and regulation, to become an off-shore competitor with the European Union,' he said, in an interview due to be broadcast on Sunday evening.\n\n'What is absolutely clear is that Europe is not going to have that. And they're going to say to the UK side - this is why this negotiation is going to be very ugly and very difficult - they're going to say, 'No, we're not giving you tariff-free access to our markets if you're going to start using a whole lot of competitive tax and regulatory measures in order to undercut us'.'\n\nThe 66-year-old, who is favour of the giving the public a final say on Brexit, said any second referendum should have three options - including a no-deal Brexit - on the ballot paper.", "description": "The ex-PM made the suggestion as he backed successor Jeremy Corbyn's refusal to back a new general election while a No Deal Brexit is still possible - but demanded he go even further.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/15/20247118-0-image-a-30_1572189052893.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
