President Felipe Nyusi is expected to win a second term in a vote where insecurity and political tensions might keep some people from the polls.\n\nNyusi after voting urged Mozambicans to avoid violence and maintain \u201ctotal serenity, total calm\u201d \u2014 a week after police acknowledged that several suspects in the murder of prominent local election observer Anastacio Matavel were police officers, leading to condemnation from some international vote observer groups.\n\nLocal feelings on Nyusi are mixed. The president can claim credit for the $25 billion Mozambique Liquid Natural Gas project, part of efforts to tap substantial deposits of natural gas, but his first term has been overshadowed by an economic crisis caused by a $2 billion corruption scandal in which companies set up by the secret services and defense ministry secretly borrowed money to set up projects that never materialized.\n\nThe opposition Renamo\u2019s candidate and new leader Ossufo Momade is expected to benefit from the party\u2019s popularity in the countryside.\n\nA beaming Momade held up the inked proof of his vote and called on supporters to participate \u201cmassively\u201d in the election. In comments carried by national broadcaster TVM, he called on \u201cmy brother\u201d Nyusi and security forces to respect the popular vote, and he cited the recently signed peace deal.\n\nMomade also held up what appeared to be tampered-with ballots, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s can\u2019t continue like this \u2026 We want democracy. We want peace.\u201d He said his party would not accept any vote manipulation.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of election day violence.\n\nAlso seeking the presidency is opposition MDM candidate Daviz Simango, the mayor of Beira city, which suffered badly in the devastating Cyclone Idai earlier this year.\n\nThe country on the Indian Ocean was hit by Idai and, weeks later, Cyclone Kenneth, raising fears about what climate change would bring to the sprawling coastline in the decades to come. Hundreds of thousands of people are still recovering from the storms and hunger is a growing concern as months remain before the next substantial harvest.\n\nInsecurity also poses a growing threat. At least 10 polling centers were not opening in northernmost Cabo Delgado province as Mozambique\u2019s election authority said it could not guarantee safety from attacks by shadowy Islamic extremists, who have killed more than 400 people in the past two years. That means some 5,400 people are not able to vote.\n\nSome 13 million Mozambicans are registered to vote. Vote counting starts after polls close at 6 p.m. local time and preliminary results are expected Wednesday, with full provisional results before the end of the week.\n\nA runoff will be held if no presidential candidate wins a majority of the vote.\n\nFor the first time Mozambicans are also electing provincial governors, a key concession to Renamo. Previously all governors were appointed by the ruling party.\n\nIn 10 of the country\u2019s 11 provinces, the governor will be the lead candidate of the party or list which wins the most votes in the provincial assembly election. Maputo, the 11th province and the capital, is both a city and a province and it was decided not to add a governor to the elected mayor.\n\nHowever, Frelimo has established a new management layer, a provincial secretary of state, which will be appointed by the president and take on many of the powers that governors have had up to now.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa", "description": "MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) \u2014 Calls for calm and warnings against voter intimidation marked a closely watched election day in Mozambique on Tuesday that is", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/b14a06_mozambique-elections-92228-mozambican-president-felipe-nyusi-poses-polling-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
