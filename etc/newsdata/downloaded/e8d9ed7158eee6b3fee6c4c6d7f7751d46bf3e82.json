The \u201csubstantive provisions\u201d of the bill governing the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU \u201cwould extend and apply to the whole of the U.K.,\u201d the note said.\n\nAccelerated negotiations between the U.K. and EU began on Friday and carried on through the weekend, but it is not yet clear whether the British government will achieve the aims it has set out in the documents.\n\nAs the Commons reconvenes this afternoon, Johnson will say that \u201cpeople are tired of stasis, gridlock and waiting for change\u201d and promise to \u201cget the gears on our national gearbox working again.\u201d\n\nThe government will seek to introduce an Environment Bill to enshrine environmental principles in law and create an independent regulator to scrutinize policy, according to the speech. It will also seek to reform its visa system for skilled migrants, create a new scientific funding agency and set out a national space strategy.", "description": "Speech sets out what Boris Johnson wants his government to do.", "authors": ["Eleni Courea", "Rym Momtaz", "Jacopo Barigazzi"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175846179-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
