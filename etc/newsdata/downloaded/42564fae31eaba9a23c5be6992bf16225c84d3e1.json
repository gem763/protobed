'I remember seeing photographs of myself and I was critical of my body composition from a very young age.'\n\n'I don't know if that was to do with my identical twin brothers - I grew up with identical twin brothers - which I think can make you compare and you can say, \"Where is my twin?\".\n\nAdmitting that the illness could have killed him, Christopher said: 'I think eating disorders are often about perfection, an unrealistic idea of how we should look. So I think it was going on there. I was thinking, \"You can look better, you can look better\".'\n\nCandid: The actor sat down with ITV's Lorraine on Tuesday to discuss his illness, as he promotes his new autobiography I Love the Bones of You\n\nHe added that he often wonders how his own children are feeling now they're the same age as he was when he first developed signs of the illness, explaining 'pre puberty\u2026 We don't really know how children, what children are [thinking]. I have a 6-year-old and a 7-year-old. Do we really know how they are perceiving the world?'\n\nThe actor went on to explain that the reaction to his book, where he also details his struggle with depression and his father's dementia, has been overwhelming.\n\n'I've been taken aback, because I get stopped in the street\u2026 people are now stopping me and saying, \"Thank you for speaking about depression, thank you for speaking about anorexia, dementia\".'\n\nStruggle: Christopher, 55, revealed his first developed anorexia at the age of six, and theorises that growing up with identical twin brothers may have fueled his critical attitude\n\nBut the star confessed that opening up about his struggles had been difficult at times, admitting: 'It caused a bit of a wobble a couple of weeks ago with some of the issues that are in the book.'\n\n'The intensity and doing things like this, talking about it on television\u2026 there is a pressure there. We spoke earlier about how I was being rewarded in the industry for looking a certain way. But to get that way I had to do certain things that led to mental health issues.'\n\nChristopher explained that he suffered a mental health crisis while filming his acclaimed drama The A Word in 2015, which coincided with the breakdown of his four year marriage. He was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and was put on a 24 hour watch in a London psychiatric hospital.\n\n'It really started to manifest itself on the first series, the breakdown, and what I noticed that when I was on set and I put on Maurice's costume, and I this sounds silly almost, but when I put on Maurice's costume I could do my job.'\n\nDepression: Christopher suffered a mental health crisis while filming his acclaimed drama The A Word in 2015, which coincided with the breakdown of his four year marriage\n\n'But then when I went back to the hotel room at night that's when the insomnia and anxiety went through the roof\u2026 the job kept me going. Pretending to be someone else, it's the big acting clich\u00e9 but it was the truth.'\n\nChristopher admitted his young children Albert and Esme have got him through, revealing that a consultant in hospital told him '\"If you were to take your own life, think of the legacy that would create for your children.\"'\n\n'That woke me up. As did him explaining to me my brain chemistry, in the way a surgeon would explain a broken arm. You're in flight or fight mode and your brain is exhausted. He took the curse of it and the taboo off of mental health issues.'\n\nFor confidential support call the Samaritans on 116123 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details.", "description": "Doctor Who star Christopher Eccleston has spoken out in a candid new interview about his decades battling anorexia.", "authors": ["Joanna Crawley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/11/19438700-0-image-a-6_1570531960664.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
