And they happen to be fantastic people, too,\u201d New York Times correspondent Michael D. Shear said in a tweet directed toward Mr. Trump. \u201cYour personal attacks on them (and other reporters) are completely misplaced, beneath your office and simply wrong.\u201d\n\nThe White House has publicly feuded with reporters throughout Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, including suspending the press credentials last month of Playboy correspondent Brian Karem. More recently, a federal court judge subsequently issued a decision on Tuesday this week effectively requiring the White House to reinstate Mr. Karem\u2019s press pass.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
