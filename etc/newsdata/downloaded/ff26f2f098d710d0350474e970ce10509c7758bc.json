After all, they spend all day cooking, handling and serving the stuff. They subsequently have a pretty good idea of which menu items are great and which are best avoided. Here are four McDonald's products that they are happy to serve you - but would never eat themselves.\n\nOur friends at Business Insider recently quizzed several McDonald's US staff members (both former and current) to find out which menu items they personally avoided. Most of their preferences came down to personal taste, although nutrition also played a part.\n\nWhile the survey was conducted in the US - and was entirely subjective - it's still interesting to see which products Macca's staff aren't crazy about. Here are four examples that your local fry jockey probably won't be scoffing on her lunch break:\n\nFillet-O-Fish\n\nFish often raises alarm bells in restaurants, but the main reason for this product's unpopularity is actually generational: It just isn't 'cool' enough for Macca's younger staff.\n\nOne former crew member said they viewed the filet-o-fish as a meal popular with older customers. \u201cI assume it\u2019s easy for them to chew,\u201d they added. Nobody in Business Insider's survey was a fan of the Fillet-O-Fish. (Life hack: they taste much better if you eschew the tartar sauce and add Nando's Peri Peri instead.)\n\nThe Most Revealing Responses From McDonald's 'Our Food Your Questions' Campaign For the past few years, McDonald's Australia has been inviting customers to grill the company about its products on the Our Food Your Questions website. No question is off-limits, including whether Quarter Pounders have shrunk in size (they have) and whether McMuffins use free-range eggs (they don't). While this was obviously a PR stunt designed to engage customers and their wallets, the amount of transparency still surprised us. Here are 15 of the most revealing \u2014 and weirdest \u2014 responses from the campaign so far.

While McDonald's Australia does not sell the exact same salads, the caveat definitely still applies: Adding crispy chicken and/or noodles to your salad ramps up the kilojoule count considerably - and that's before you add any dressing.\n\nTakeaway Truth: McDonald's 'Real Choices' Chicken Salad Range Takeaway Truth is an occasional Lifehacker feature where we compare marketing images against what you actually get served. Today. McDonald's Real Choices Crunchy Noodle Chicken Salad and Warm Chicken Salad.

Again, the sweet tea options in Australia are quite different to the US, but the advice still holds: If you care about your waistline, go for a sugar-free soft drink (or better yet, water.) Adding a scoop of ice cream to your frozen Coke is an indulgence you don't need.\n\nFast Food Face-Off: Which Takeaway Chain Has The Worst-Value Soft Drink? Fast Food Face-Off is a new, occasional Lifehacker feature where we compare seemingly identical takeaway products from rival stores to determine which offers the best value. Today. soft drink sizes from McDonald's, Hungry Jack's, Subway and KFC.

If it's not on the regular menu, maybe it's not that great, eh?\n\nHow To Make The McDonald's McRib At Home The McDonald's McRib is a fan favourite in the US, but it sadly has never made it to Australia. But never fear. this homemade version is even better.
