For more information, see our ethics policy .\n\nWe\u2019re hosting a special deals event this week, featuring exclusive deals on a broad range of tech products only for Verge readers. Instead of overwhelming you with a billion deals, we\u2019ve hand-picked a tight list of products \u2014 many of which have been tested here at The Verge \u2014 from retailers like B&H Photo, BuyDig, Razer, and Amazon.\n\nWhether you\u2019re going back to school, starting a new job, or are just feeling the need to refresh some of your tech, there are plenty of deals below to suit shoppers with big or small budgets. We\u2019ve also included helpful insights and links to our relevant coverage so you can make an informed purchase.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for phones, wireless chargers, and headphones, you\u2019ll want to check out today\u2019s new deals right here.\n\nLast thing: if you\u2019re looking for even more deals on gaming tech, our pals at Polygon will have you covered.\n\nLaptops\n\nThe LG Gram 17 (with WQXGA display, 8th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB M.2 NVMe PCIe SSD, supports Thunderbolt 3) is $1,529 (usually $1,696.99) at B&H Photo.\n\nMy colleague Chris Welch recently reviewed this machine, and he praised its lightweight build, excellent 17-inch screen, and inclusion of Thunderbolt 3. This price is slightly lower than the best offer we\u2019ve seen so far, but it\u2019s far better than what other retailers currently sell it for.\n\nThe Dell XPS 13 (with FHD display, 8th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 256GB M.2 NVMe PCIe SSD, supports Thunderbolt 3) is $1,279 at B&H Photo.\n\nThis model usually lists for $1,691.25, and it\u2019s the first XPS 13 to get rid of the nostril cam, putting it up near the top of the display. Dieter Bohn says that this edition of the Dell XPS 13 is \u201cgreat all around\u201d in the review, and it might be a great fit for you if you want a small, well-rounded machine without breaking the bank.\n\nThe Razer Blade Stealth (with FHD display, 8th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics, 256GB M.2 NVMe PCIe SSD storage, supports Thunderbolt 3) is $1,199 (usually $1,299). Verge readers can get this price with the offer code AFFVOXBAG used at checkout.\n\nOut of the grouping of laptops above, the Blade Stealth is most suited for playing a few games. It\u2019s very much designed to look like a gaming laptop, with sharp edges and LED backlighting, though it\u2019s also perhaps the closest thing to a MacBook Pro in terms of design that Windows users can find.\n\nPC / Mac accessories\n\nThe HooToo USB-C hub pictured above (three USB 3.0 ports, SD card reader, HDMI, 55W pass-through) is $25.99 at Amazon with the offer code TV6PVAH8 used at checkout.\n\nMy colleague Chaim Gartenberg has tried a lot of different USB-hubs, and HooToo\u2019s is one of the better ones that you can buy. It\u2019s hard to find a hub that can do it all (this one lacks Ethernet), but it offers 55W pass-through, three USB 3.0 ports, an SD card slot, and HDMI.\n\nThe RavPower 45W USB-C GaN wall charger is $29.99 (usually $49.99) at Amazon with the offer code TVK3YGQI.\n\nThis wall charger is especially great if you have outlets without much clearance. It\u2019s slim, letting you plug in your USB-C device (phone, laptop, Nintendo Switch, etc.) on its bottom. It\u2019s fast, too, providing enough power to fast-charge any phone, even the new Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus, as well as the MacBook Air.\n\nGaming\n\nXbox One S (the disc-less All Digital Edition console) is $229 (usually $368.95) at BuyDig, and it comes with one month of Xbox Live Gold service and six games (Madden NFL 20, Gears of War 4, PUBG, Minecraft, Forza Horizon 3, and Sea of Thieves). You can get this deal by using the offer code THEVERGE at checkout.\n\nat checkout. LG\u2019s 27-inch gaming monitor (G-Sync compatible, 240Hz refresh rate, 1080p, model #27GK750FB) is $249 (usually $329) at BuyDig with the offer code THEVERGE. This model was recently added to Nvidia\u2019s list of G-Sync Compatible monitors that, with a compatible GTX or RTX graphics card, can eliminate screen tearing that commonly occurs in standard monitors.\n\nStarting at 11AM ET, August 12th, Fanatical is hosting its Summer Sale, where it\u2019s discounting many PC games that you can redeem on Steam. Verge readers can save 15 percent on several of them with the offer code THEVERGE15 used at checkout. If you need a few ideas, we\u2019ve got you covered below.\n\nMisc.\n\nRing Alarm five-piece security kit is $154.99 (usually $199.99) at Daily Steals with the offer code VERGERING.\n\nThis is currently the best price available, and according to Dan Seifert\u2019s review, Ring\u2019s comprehensive smart home security system can be set up in less than 20 minutes. You can add other Ring cameras and Amazon Echo smart speakers to the mix to bolster its capabilities.", "description": "This is the first day of The Verge\u2019s deals event, with reader-exclusive deals on the LG Gram 17, Dell XPS 13, an Xbox One S bundle, and so much more.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fPbGEiR9BUAsoA2bz1-nYXVfTXI=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16389469/akrales_190619_3489_0093.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-12"}
