Sign up here.\n\nA few months ago, few people knew the Dendropsophus rozenmani existed. Scientists only just discovered the tiny, brown-striped tree frog \u2014 in a swath of forest that\u2019s now largely been burnt to a crisp on the outskirts of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe frog\u2019s habitat is a 57 million-acre tropical ecosystem in Bolivia known as the Chiquitano dry forest. It\u2019s host to a number of endangered species, and, likely, many undiscovered ones. The forest isn\u2019t any richer in biodiversity than the Amazon, but it\u2019s unique. Some species, like the tree frog and the Chiquitano Orchid, are only known to exist there and nowhere else. The fires may have permanently damaged the forest that these unusual creatures call home.\n\n\u201cWe barely skimmed the surface of what was known about mammals in this region, and this devastating loss due to the fires is simply unfathomable,\u201d said Dan Brooks, a vertebrate zoologist who worked on a project to catalogue the animals that live in the Chiquitano in 2001. His team discovered two new species of mammals, Anderson\u2019s rice rat and Yates\u2019 big-eared bat, and found many other species not previously known to live there.\n\nSince August, about 7 million acres \u2014 about a sixth of the Chiquitano dry forest \u2014 have burned, and scientists are concerned the ecosystem could be irreversibly altered. The Bolivian government said Monday that rain had finally extinguished the fires, but an estimated 2 million animals died.\n\nResearchers believe the flames threatened some 4,000 plant species and 1,600 species of animals, including jaguars, tapirs, and giant anteaters. Compared to its neighboring regions, the Chiquitano also has more species of mammals, a third of which are threatened or endangered, like the giant otter, the giant armadillo, and the maned wolf.\n\n\u201cIn the areas that were burnt, not one frog will have survived,\u201d said Martin Jansen of the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum in Frankfurt, Germany, who led the research team that discovered the amphibian last year. The fires also burned through one of Jansen\u2019s research stations and incinerated a stationary camera used to spot and track animals.\n\nThe animals that flee the flames are vulnerable, too. Hunters have lined up along the edge of the forest to gun down mammals leaving the protection of the canopy, according to Alfredo Romero-Mu\u00f1oz, a Bolivian doctoral researcher at Humboldt University in Berlin who studies agriculture and hunting in the region.\n\nSlash and burn\n\nThe fires in Bolivia, researchers and advocates believe, are largely set by people. They\u2019re clearing forest for pasture because of a push to increase agricultural production for exports. In August, the country sent its first shipment of beef to China where an outbreak of African swine flu has decimated the pork supply and pushed the country to import from abroad.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening, it\u2019s really ecocide,\u201d Pablo Solon, who worked in Bolivian President Evo Morales\u2019 administration as ambassador to the UN from 2009 to 2011, told VICE News.\n\nREAD: Only 8 people in this indigenous tribe still speak their native language. The Amazon fires may wipe it out completely.\n\nBack in 2013, Morales announced that he\u2019d aim to triple the amount of arable farmland in Bolivia to 32 million acres by 2025. In practice, that means clearing forests. And this summer, Morales made good on that promise by passing laws that allowed farmers to legally slash and burn more land for agricultural use.\n\n\u201cThis happened in July,\u201d said Romero-Mu\u00f1oz, the doctoral researcher studying the Chiquitano forest. \u201cAnd in August, the fires started. So these are direct outcome of these policies.\u201d\n\nIn Santa Cruz, a city in the same province as the Chiquitano forest, people took to the streets Friday to protest the government\u2019s lack of response to the fires. The opposition party has called on Morales to declare a national emergency, which would streamline international aid money. But his administration hasn\u2019t declared one over concerns that international cash could lead to foreign meddling in Bolivia.\n\n\u201cThe government says that forest fires are cyclical,\u201d Solon said. \u201cNow, they\u2019re up, and they say this is because of climate change, and then they will let up. They claim no responsibility for what has happened.\u201d\n\nWhile the Bolivian government may be using climate change as a scapegoat for the devastation caused by its agricultural policies, fires like these will become more severe and frequent as the world warms. Forests like the Chiquitano also keep carbon out of the atmosphere, and, as they burn, they\u2019ll release even more carbon, which also makes the world hotter.\n\nUltimately, the damage done by the fires in the Chiquitano may be irreversible.\n\n\u201cIt would take more than 200 years for the Chiquitano to recover,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cThat\u2019s the estimate, but nobody really knows. And even if we had 200 years, we would need the political will to repair the forest for two centuries. I just cannot see that happening.\u201d\n\nCover image: In this Aug. 30, 2019 file photo, police and firefighters work to put out a fire in the Chiquitania forest on the outskirts of Robore, Bolivia.
