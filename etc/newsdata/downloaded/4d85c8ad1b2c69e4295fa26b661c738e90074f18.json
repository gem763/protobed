As parents, we hope to teach our kids to be polite. But what does that really look like? To many, it means to smile, to speak quietly, and dole out hugs when asked. To walk, not run, to eat all of the food served up and agree, even when we disagree. The message is clear: If, as parents, we don\u2019t comply with the flow of societal expectations in this way, if we don't teach our kids to \"behave\", then we\u2019ve failed.\n\nHowever, forced affection and politeness are not characteristics and behaviours I\u2019m teaching my daughter (or son, for that matter) to uphold. The pressure to be a polite, sweet, graceful woman is astounding. Be firm, but not too firm. Be opinionated, but not passionately so. And while I can\u2019t make that all go away for my daughter, the teachings begin now.\n\nYou'll Also Love: How Not to Raise a Mean Girl\n\nThe first instance that I was sexually assaulted that I\u2019m open to talking about happened when I was about 8. It was by a neighbourhood friend. The uncle to our neighbours, a middle-aged, kind and fun-type guy. Appeared clean-cut, hardworking and trustworthy by societal standards. He would invite us to sit on his lap and have us hold his hand. And we were told to not be rude, and oblige him. We didn\u2019t protest when his caresses became inappropriate, nor did I fully understand what was happening. I thought this was expected, that this was a part of being polite. So nothing was said, then, nor several times thereafter by numerous other men as I grew up.\n\nIf we object, we\u2019re being difficult, or making a fuss and a \u2018big deal out of nothing.\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s the uncomfortable reality: these occurrences are normalized. Expectations are placed on young girls from an early age. From such flippant remarks as \u201cYou\u2019d be so much prettier if you smile!\u201d \u2014 sometimes stated by family and friends, sometimes by complete strangers \u2014 to how girls are conditioned to put up with such remarks and unwanted touch. If we object, we\u2019re being difficult, or making a fuss and a \u2018big deal out of nothing.\u2019 How many of us \u2014 I\u2019m speaking to my fellow women \u2014 grew up putting up with such standards, pretending it\u2019s not awkward, and questioning ourselves before we question anyone else?\n\nYou'll Also Love: Things I Say And Do to Raise My Kids' Confidence\n\nWhile I\u2019m fully aware that not all forms of touch are associated with predatory behaviour, I am also fully aware that sexual innuendos directed towards women begins when we are girls. Comments about \"blossoming\" and looking \"grown up\" (often accompanied by a wink and a side-eye between adults) aren\u2019t funny, they\u2019re creepy. And I\u2019m far from a prude. I do think there is a way to engage in talking about sexual awareness and pleasure with kids, especially when their own bodies start changing, and that it would do us all some good to lighten up a bit and take ourselves less seriously. But I also think that we need to be talking about these things, because it\u2019s not all so black and white. Context is everything. So is choice.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t have it all figured out, some things I know for sure: my own daughter doesn\u2019t have to smile for strangers.\n\nAnd girls have been conditioned to brush off what\u2019s not okay.\n\nSo, while I don\u2019t have it all figured out, some things I know for sure: my own daughter doesn\u2019t have to smile for strangers. And she doesn\u2019t have to hug family or friends upon demand. Nor does she have to sit on strangers\u2019 laps. This includes Santa. She may use her voice to say no if she disagrees with someone or if she is uncomfortable. She may yield her voice with passion and firm leadership to the point of being brazen.\n\nI didn't always identify as a feminist. But if you asked me now, on the cusp of turning forty, if I'm a feminist who plans on raising my daughter to also be a feminist, I would answer matter-of-factly that yes, I am, because I\u2019m not trying to be polite and I'm not scared of being the \"bad\" or \"wrong\" type of feminist anymore. I just am one. It\u2019s my responsibility to be one. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m okay with not having a choice about in being anymore.\n\nMay our daughters embrace and know the familiarity of being uncomfortable while challenging the status quo. May they find solidarity in the company of others with a similar moral compass \u2014 and may they continue to push against a system that thinks they\u2019d be so much prettier if they smiled.", "description": "Part of making change is raising our daughters to speak up and speak out.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/parents/content/imgs/_8col/notpolite_lead_123RF.jpg"}
