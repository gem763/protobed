Several months later, Laura K. Cooper, the Pentagon official in charge of Ukraine and Russia policy, touted the forthcoming aid package, which would be joined by $141 million from the State Department.\n\n\u201cYou can count on the United States to remain your strong partner in strengthening Ukraine\u2019s military to defend Ukrainian democracy,\u201d Cooper said in a video address on Dec. 7, 2018, as she stood before the Ukrainian and American flags.\n\nBut months went by, and the assistance did not come, not even after a May letter from the undersecretary of defense in charge of policy, John C. Rood, in which he affirmed that the Ukrainians had \u201ctaken substantial actions to make defense institutional reforms for the purposes of decreasing corruption, increasing accountability, and sustaining improvements of combat capability enabled by U.S. assistance.\u201d\n\nNow less than a year later, Cooper, who played a crucial role in trying to move the Ukrainian aid forward, is set to testify Friday in the impeachment inquiry being led by Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman. Cooper is the first career official to testify from the Pentagon, which has largely remained outside the recent political controversy.\n\nThe impeachment panel has already heard from Kurt D. Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, former National Security Council aide and Russia expert Fiona Hill and State Department official George P. Kent. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, has testified twice, including on Thursday.\n\nSchiff\u2019s office did not answer requests for comment about Cooper\u2019s expected testimony.\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep.

In fact, her public assurances to Ukrainians about the coming assistance make clear that she fully expected the funds to flow sometime in early 2019.\n\nA former senior U.S. official confirmed that Cooper was involved in such efforts. That could make her testimony crucial to Democrats\u2019 argument that President Trump and his loyalists were guided solely by political considerations.\n\nWhat\u2019s known from the public record is that by June, the money remained tied up in a bureaucratic quagmire because the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget had put a hold on the funding. Throughout the summer, frustrated Pentagon officials endeavored to figure out why that hold was in place. They went so far as to conduct a legal analysis, determining the hold had no merit, since Congress had already appropriated the funds.\n\nThat forced the White House budget office to reveal to the Pentagon that the hold had been ordered by the president.\n\nAs the assistance remained in limbo, Trump in a July 25 call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asked for Kiev\u2019s help in investigating Hunter Biden, who had been involved with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nConservatives contend that Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings were improper and merit an investigation; the president\u2019s detractors say that Trump only seemed to pressure Zelensky for such an investigation because Hunter Biden\u2019s father, Joe Biden, is running for president.\n\nAlthough the funding was released to Ukraine in mid-September, a whistleblower that month filed a complaint about the Zelensky phone call with the inspector general of the intelligence community. That complaint has served as the basis of an impeachment inquiry launched by Democrats.", "description": "Laura Cooper, who played a crucial role in trying to move the Ukrainian aid forward, is set to testify Friday in the impeachment inquiry being led by Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman.", "authors": ["Alexander Nazaryan", "National Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bhlFWfWspA5.4AVJjytp7g--~B/aD01NTg7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/9fcb78a0-f13a-11e9-b67f-6f65eb5cf753", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
