Six other top department officials have resigned or been pushed out since April, including former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nMcAleenan \u2014 who held the role after Nielsen\u2019s departure \u2014 oversaw a recent reduction in the number of migrants caught at the southwest border, a measure used to estimate illegal crossings. Still, he faced criticism from Trump allies inside and outside the administration, who argued he was not sufficiently committed to the president\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\nThe move comes as Trump gears up for his 2020 reelection campaign. Trump has signaled that immigration will be a central focus of his appeal to voters and has taken a number of steps in recent months to limit access to asylum and intensify enforcement within the U.S.\n\nThe administration in July issued a bar on asylum seekers who pass through another country en route to the U.S., a restriction aimed at blocking Central American migrants traveling north. Last month, the Supreme Court allowed the policy to be implemented pending the outcome of a court challenge.\n\nThe administration also has forced more than 48,000 non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico pending the outcome of their U.S. cases under a policy known as the Migrant Protection Protocols. While the Trump administration credits the \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d expansion for helping diminish the flow at the border, advocates contend it strands vulnerable migrants in dangerous border towns.\n\nWith McAleenan\u2019s exit, Trump will have cycled through four DHS chiefs in less than three years. Many of the department\u2018s senior leadership positions remain vacant or filled by acting officials.\n\nDavid Pekoske, administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, is currently serving as acting DHS deputy secretary, and is next line to become acting secretary. But acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli is rumored to be a possible McAleenan successor. Another frequently mentioned candidate is Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection.\n\nMcAleenan conceded in an Oct. 1 Washington Post article that he didn\u2019t have authority to rein in the two immigration officials, both of whom are vocal Trump boosters and frequent guests on cable television.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t have control over is the tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time,\u201d McAleeanan said. \u201cThat\u2019s uncomfortable, as the accountable, senior figure.\u201d\n\nBorder arrests soared earlier this year to levels not seen in a decade, a phenomenon that stretched federal resources. The Trump administration, with McAleeanan at the forefront, argued to members of Congress that the migrant flow had caused a humanitarian crisis at the border that required additional funding.\n\nDemocrats criticized the administration\u2019s approach to enforcement and blasted reports of dangerous and overcrowded conditions for migrant children and adults held in border processing centers. Still, the Democrat-led House joined the Republican-led Senate to pass a $4.6 billion emergency border spending package in June.\n\nMcAleenan, a top border official under former President Barack Obama, became acting commissioner of CBP during the start of the Trump administration and was confirmed to the role in March 2018. From that perch, he saw border arrests bottom out at the start of Trump\u2019s tenure \u2014 what some called \u201cthe Trump effect\u201d \u2014 only to rebound and surge again this year.\n\nBorder Patrol arrested nearly 133,000 migrants at the southwest border in May, the biggest monthly total since March 2006. With migrants flooding in, Trump threatened to hammer Mexico with tariffs unless it increased efforts to stem the flow. Mexico agreed in June to deploy 6,000 members of its newly formed National Guard to intercept migrants heading north. At the same time, the U.S. moved to expand its \u201cremain in Mexico\u201c program border-wide.\n\nBorder arrests dropped to roughly 51,000 in August, a major decrease that experts partly attributed to the new enforcement measures.\n\nWhile Secretary of State Mike Pompeo negotiated the Mexico deal, McAleenan oversaw the department\u2019s implementation of the asylum clampdown and other counter-migration measures.\n\nFollowing the Mexico agreement, McAleenan joined Trump in July to announce an asylum deal with Guatemala that would require that country to accept asylum seekers who passed through its territory while traveling to the U.S. He struck similar agreements with El Salvador and Honduras in September, although none of the three pacts have been implemented.\n\nPro-migrant advocates and Democrats blasted the agreements, which they argued would send asylum seekers to some of the most dangerous countries in the hemisphere.\n\nMcAleenan faced partisan pressure when ProPublica in July uncovered a secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents. Members of the group mocked the death of a detained teenage migrant and posted obscene illustrations of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), among other offensive comments and images.\n\nAlthough McAleenan swiftly condemned the posts, POLITICO later reported that CBP officials had been aware of the group for up to three years.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bd/d9/a1f9755f4f86b49137a890d08937/191011-kevin-mcaleenan-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
