The exhibition is due to open on 24 October.\n\nAs a symbolic gesture, Italy\u2019s culture minister, Dario Franceschini, and his French counterpart, Franck Riester, signed the accord last month, ending a feud triggered by the previous Italian government over the loans. In return, France will lend Italy paintings by Raphael for events marking 500 years since his death next year.\n\nIn its complaint, Italia Nostra had argued that because Vitruvian Man could be displayed only for short periods every six years, it risked having to be concealed for up to a decade if shown at the Louvre because the drawing had previously been exhibited in Venice this year.\n\nThe Louvre holds five of only 14 paintings attributed to Leonardo, who was born near the Tuscan town of Vinci in 1452. The other works by the artist being borrowed by the museum include the Battle of Anghiari and the Adoration of the Magi, both housed at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Leonardo died in France in 1519.", "description": "Challenge by Italian heritage group threatened to disrupt deal with Paris museum", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/568e7dc1d1f66c2ffc6dc97eaac1da6373bda7b6/0_472_6314_3788/master/6314.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a97da646c73c33ffb72b59e2f6e54a79", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
