England go into their match against second-placed Czech Republic on Friday night three points clear and with a game in hand. Fair to say it should be a fairly standard qualification for Gareth Southgate's men. In fact, a win in Prague will secure the country's qualification.\n\nElsewhere, the real battle is on for the second spot. Montenegro and Bulgaria have drifted away, leaving Czech Republic and Kosovo to battle it out. With the Czechs facing England next, it gives Kosovo a chance to climb into pole position with a victory over Montenegro on Monday. A month later, they travel to Plzen.\n\nEngland can secure their place at Euro 2020 with a victory over the Czech Republic in Prague\n\nGROUP B\n\nTeams: Ukraine, Portugal, Serbia, Luxembourg, Lithuania\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, it's Ukraine in top spot of Group B, having dropped their only points in a draw away at Portugal. It would be a huge shock if Cristiano Ronaldo's second-placed side didn't occupy one of the top automatic qualification spots.\n\nAs it stands, they have a game in hand and can secure qualification if they secure victories in their upcoming matches against Luxembourg and Lithuania. Serbia, meanwhile, still have hope in third, but it will need a fair few results in their favour.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's Portugal sit second in the group but are favourites to progress in top spot\n\nGROUP C\n\nTeams: Germany, Northern Ireland, Holland, Belarus, Estonia\n\nIn perhaps the most exciting group of them all, Northern Ireland are threatening to cause a massive shock as they sit joint-top of the group with Germany, three points ahead of Holland - who have a game in hand.\n\nIn reality though, you would still expect the Dutch to go through, given their next two games are against Michael O'Neill's side, home and away. If they can secure a couple of victories, they know that Northern Ireland then face Germany away in their final match. It'll be tough for the British side if they are going to automatically qualify. Belarus and Estonia, meanwhile, are long gone.\n\nNorthern Ireland beat Luxembourgh in the last round of fixtures and are level with Germany\n\nGROUP D\n\nTeams: Republic of Ireland, Denmark, Switzerland, Georgia, Gibraltar\n\nAnother home nation threatening to cause a shock are the Republic of Ireland, with two traditionally bigger nations below them in Denmark and Switzerland. One negative for the Irish, though, is that they have just one home match remaining.\n\nMick McCarthy's men travel to Switzerland on Tuesday, and a poor result there could see them drop out of the automatic qualification places ahead of the final two fixtures. The Swiss are more than likely to qualify despite sitting in third place as it stands, given they finish their campaign against Georgia and Gibraltar. For now, though, it's all eyes on the Stade de Geneve on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland are two points clear at the top but have a tough clash with Switzerland\n\nGROUP E\n\nTeams: Croatia, Slovakia, Hungary, Wales, Azerbaijan\n\nIt's all still to play for in Group E, where four of the five teams still have a real chance of qualification - and Wales are right in the middle of it. As it stands, Chris Coleman's side are fourth of five, but they have a game in hand which - goal difference depending - could take them second.\n\nCroatia are in pole position with 10 points, while Slovakia and Hungary sit behind them with nine. Both of those latter two sides need to travel to Croatia, giving the Welsh great hopes of qualification. Friday will go a long way to clearing this group up though: it's Croatia vs Hungary and Slovakia vs Wales.\n\nGareth Bale and Wales have their work cut out if they are to qualify for the Euro 2020 finals\n\nGROUP F\n\nTeams: Spain, Sweden, Romania, Norway, Malta, Faroe Islands\n\nFair to say Spain will be at Euro 2020 after six wins from six matches. In that time, they've scored 17 and conceded a measly three. Below them, it is a three-way shootout between Sweden, Romania and Norway, who sit on 11, 10 and nine respectively.\n\nAll three must play Spain, but it's Romania who have the hardest task as they have to host both Norway and Sweden. They'll likely have to win both those matches to be in with a chance of automatic qualification.\n\nSpain have romped ahead in Group F, but it's much tighter in the fight for second place\n\nGROUP G\n\nTeams: Poland, Slovenia, Austria, North Macedonia, Israel, Latvia\n\nPoland looked to be flying through with four wins from four, but a draw and a defeat in their last two has allowed the chasing pack to creep up behind them. As it stands, five teams could technically still qualify.\n\nSlovenia sit second, but a difficult final-game trip to Poland could see them trip up, with Austria the favourites to nick second. Their trip to Slovenia on Sunday is absolutely crucial though. Of the five able to go through, North Macedonia have the hardest run of it... they are the only team not to have point-less Latvia in their remaining fixtures.\n\nPoland and Austria played out a draw in their last fixture, which helped neither climb the table\n\nGROUP H\n\nTeams: Turkey, France, Iceland, Albania, Moldova, Andorra\n\nGroup H looks to be a three-way shootout too, with Turkey, France and Iceland leading the way. Despite their one defeat, you would expect world champions France to kick on and win their remaining four games to qualify.\n\nIt's then Turkey's to lose in the battle for an automatic spot... they know that victories against Iceland, Albania and Andorra will guarantee them a place. Iceland will perhaps look back on their shock defeat in Albania as the turning point for them.\n\nFrance beat Andorra in their last game, and are the favourites to qualify at the top of Group H\n\nGROUP I\n\nTeams: Belgium, Russia, Kazakhstan, Cyprus, Scotland, San Marino\n\nThe most impressive team in qualification so far, Belgium can qualify on Thursday night with a victory at home to bottom-placed San Marino. Fair to say, it would be one of the biggest shocks in European football history if they didn't make it seven wins from seven.\n\nBelow them, Russia are also closing in on a place at the tournament and can go through if they beat Scotland and Cyprus-Kazakhstan finishes as a draw. All of this is bad news for Scotland, who won't be getting into the automatic places.\n\nBelgium can qualify for Euro 2020 with a win over bottom-placed San Marino on Thursday\n\nGROUP J\n\nTeams: Italy, Finland, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Liechtenstein\n\nAnother team with a perfect qualification record to date is Italy, who have won all six of their games and will qualify barring a minor miracle. In fact, they can secure their spot with a win over struggling Greece on Saturday.\n\nThe race for second is far more interesting, with Finland on 12, Armenia on nine and Bosnia and Herzegovina on seven... but it is Finland who have the upper hand given they've played Italy twice already. Bosnia and Herzegovina face a must-win game at home to Finland on Saturday if they are to have any chance of climbing up the table.\n\nArmenia, meanwhile, could very much be in contention if results go their way in the coming matches, but their final group match away at Italy could be a sticking point.", "description": "With Euro 2020 being held across Europe, there are no automatic qualifying berths and every side at next summer's tournament will have had to earn their spot.
