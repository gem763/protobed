The treatment is up to 90% effective, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nART is just as promising -- a 2019 study of almost 1,000 gay male couples with one HIV-positive partner who took the treatment found no new cases of transmission to the HIV-negative partner during sex without a condom.\n\nRead More", "description": "New HIV diagnoses in the United Kingdom have fallen by almost a third since 2015, bringing the island nation closer to its goal of zero new HIV transmissions by 2030.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190305222709-pba-hiv-aids-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
