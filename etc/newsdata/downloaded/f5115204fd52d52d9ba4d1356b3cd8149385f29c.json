You can form your own view.

It\u2019s typical of Remainer campaigners to try and you should be quite ashamed, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\nWhen Dr Nicholl replied: \u201cCan I remind you I wrote the plans in mitigation?\u201d, Mr Rees-Mogg lashed out by accusing him of being incompetent.\n\n\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t write very good plans if you hadn\u2019t worked out how to mitigate, had you? It\u2019s fortunate that they\u2019re being written by other people now who are serious about mitigating and not remoaners,\u201d he told the doctor.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Their reckless pursuit of a no-deal Brexit is putting lives at risk.\u201d\n\nDr Nicholl also accused Michael Gove, the cabinet minister, of misleading the public when he claimed the stark problems outlined in the Yellowhammer dossier were \u201ca worst-case scenario\u201d.\n\nHe insisted they were the planners\u2019 best guess of what will happen \u2013 after the government appeared to admit the document, far from being \u201cout of date\u201d, as claimed, dated from the start of August.\n\nAt the weekend, The Sunday Times revealed that doctors had warned the NHS to brace itself for the \u201cbiggest threat it has ever faced\u201d if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.\n\nConfidential files seen by the newspaper revealed lists of drugs it has been impossible to stockpile, putting patients at potential risk.\n\nDr Nicholl used the exchange to argue that people would die because of problems with access to drugs and radioisotopes.", "description": "Jacob Rees-Mogg has launched an extraordinary attack on a doctor helping to plan for a no-deal Brexit who warned that people will die if it goes ahead.", "authors": ["Rob Merrick"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/02/12/Jacob-Rees-Mogg.jpg"}
