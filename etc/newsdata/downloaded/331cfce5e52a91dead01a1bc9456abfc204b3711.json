The company said border delays could be a potential source of disruption.\n\nCrawley, Sussex-based Volution said that it did not see a major impact from its primary non-UK supply which comes from China. Beijing and Washington are in the middle of a drawn-out trade spat.\n\nCompanies including retailers, drugmakers and supermarket owners expect costly and debilitating delays at Britain's port of Dover and the Eurotunnel, leading them to stockpile ingredients, raw material, insulin, water and even toilet paper.\n\nVolution on Wednesday also reported a 11.5% rise in annual adjusted pretax profit to 39.9 million pounds ($48.73 million), while revenue rose 14.6% to 235.7 million pounds helped by strong organic growth as its UK market strengthened. The UK accounts for less than half of revenue.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, who is facing a fresh rebellion in his cabinet according to reports, has promised to take Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31 come what may, despite parliament passing a law ordering him to seek a delay if he cannot secure a new transition deal.
