It was my boyhood club of my dreams. I'm still a United fan now despite what happened.\n\n'Going to Burnley was a really good decision we made at the time.\n\nMcNeil was forced to look elsewhere but has not looked back since joining Burnley\n\n'I think overall I've become a more mature person. That helps with me in the dressing room and the people I get put around, the coaching staff and the gaffer we have at the club.\n\n'I've become more mature, more calm and confident in myself and more relaxed on the pitch as well as off the pitch.'\n\nMcNeil played alongside Angel Gomes, Mason Greenwood, Brandon Williams and James Garner in United's academy, with all four now having made first-team debuts.\n\nBurnley boss Dyche recently claimed McNeil, who has three goals to his name, will 'outgrow' the club and revealed he is wary of 'over-coaching' him.\n\nMcNeil has two assists already this season and has gone on to play 30 times in the top flight\n\n'The gaffer will let me figure it out on my own, which I think is good for my development,' McNeil added.\n\n'He and the coaches will talk to me when they need to, when I'm doing well and not so well.\n\n'They help me in and out of possession because I'm maturing as a player, tactically and physically. I'll give everything I have got to help the team.'", "description": "The winger, set for an England Under 21 debut in Slovenia on Friday, has already racked up 30 Premier League appearances for Sean Dyche's side and has two assists this season.", "authors": ["Jack Gaughan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/21/19509192-0-image-a-62_1570651777454.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
