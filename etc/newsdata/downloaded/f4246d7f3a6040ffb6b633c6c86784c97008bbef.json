Goldman, Morgan Stanley debate", "language": "en", "text": "Value investors have had reason to cheer in recent weeks as inexpensive stocks have outperformed those with faster-growing earnings and sales by a healthy margin.\n\nDuring the past three months SPDR S&P 500 Value ETF SPYV, -0.06% has outperformed both the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.14% and the SPDR S&P 500 Growth ETF SPYG, -0.15%, with value falling just 0.4%, versus a 1.5% decline for the S&P 500 and a 2.5% loss for growth.\n\nBut the trend has been running out of steam during October \u2014 value has fallen 0.1% month-to-date versus growth\u2019s 0.2% decline \u2014 helping instigate a debate over which factor will treat investors more kindly during the final quarter of 2019 and beyond.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts, led by David Kostin, argued in a research note published over the weekend that the recent rotation into growth will appear, in hindsight, to be another in a series of false alarms, because a future slow-but-steady U.S. economy will ultimately play to the favor of growth stocks.\n\n\u201cInvestors currently pay a record-high premium for stocks with stable earnings growth versus firms with volatile growth,\u201d Kostin wrote. \u201cBut as economic activity slows, stocks with volatile growth tend to experience earnings weakness and falling valuations, and investors gravitate towards stocks with more stability,\u201d he added, warning that investors lured to value stocks by their relatively low prices will be burned in the coming quarters.\n\nGoldman economists expect the U.S. economy to grow at roughly 2% annually, the sort of mediocre growth rate that typically has led to outperformance of the growth factor. \u201cHistorically, value stocks have fared best during periods of very strong or very weak economic activity,\u201d Kostin wrote. \u201cDuring periods of modest economic growth, investors have typically assigned a scarcity premium to growth stocks that are able to generate idiosyncratic growth in excess of the economy.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs Investment Research\n\nBut what if economic growth in the coming quarters will be worse than just middling? Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley has been predicting that a sharp economic slowdown awaits the U.S. economy as the effects of tax-cut stimulus wains and businesses work off excess inventory and cut costs.\n\nOveroptimism about economic growth has caused investors to become too bullish on earnings growth as well, he argued in a Monday note to clients, and has lead investors to overpay for growth stocks that will ultimately fail to deliver the rising earnings that are supposed to define them.\n\n\u201cIn the first and second quarters of 2019, value saw modestly positive earnings growth while growth saw earnings shrink,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDespite this, consensus is still very optimistic on growth\u2019s earnings prospects in 2020.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley Research\n\nHe argued that growth stocks are trading at historic highs relative to their projected earnings, while earnings growth actually has been higher for value stocks since 2017.\n\nMorgan Stanley Research\n\n\u201cInvestors are still piled into growth names, hoping the earnings growth picture improves,\u201d Wilson wrote. \u201cHowever, both the last-twelve-month numbers and the next-twelve-month numbers suggest that growths earning\u2019s superiority is on hold for now.\u201d", "description": "Growth stocks will outperform if U.S. economic growth remains in the 2% range, but a more severe slowdown could put this segment of the stock market at risk", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HF425_bull_a_ZG_20190311103941.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
