So what? The \u201cjudicial Power\u201d of Article III of the Constitution isn\u2019t a promise of all good things. Letting dangerous and obviously guilty criminals who have gravely injured their victims go free just because an officer forgot to secure a warrant or because the prosecutor neglected to bring a witness to trial for confrontation seems like a bad idea to plenty of people. But do you really want judges to revise the Constitution to avoid those \u201cbad\u201d results? Or do you believe that judges should enforce the law\u2019s protections equally for everyone, regardless of how inefficient or unpopular or old the law might be? Regardless of who benefits today\u2014the criminal or the police; the business or the employee; immigrants or ICE?\n\nOf course, some suggest that originalism leads to bad results because the results inevitably happen to be politically conservative results. Rubbish. Originalism is a theory focused on process, not on substance. It is not \u201cConservative\u201d with a big C focused on politics. It is conservative in the small c sense that it seeks to conserve the meaning of the Constitution as it was written. The fact is, a good originalist judge will not hesitate to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution\u2019s original meaning, regardless of contemporary political consequences. Whether that means allowing protesters to burn the American flag (the First Amendment); prohibiting the government from slapping a GPS tracking device on the underside of your car without a warrant (the Fourth Amendment); or insisting that juries\u2014not judges\u2014should decide the facts that increase the penalty you face in a criminal case (the Sixth Amendment). In my own judicial career, I\u2019ve written many originalist rulings with so-called \u201cliberal\u201d results. Like United States v. Carloss, where I ruled that the police violated a criminal defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights by entering the curtilage of his home without a warrant despite four conspicuously posted no trespassing signs. Or Sessions v. Dimaya, where I ruled that an immigrant couldn\u2019t constitutionally be punished according to a law so vague that judges were forced to give it content by fiat. Or Carpenter v. United States, where I explained that simply giving your property to another doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you lose all your Fourth Amendment rights in it. I could go on and on. So could any originalist judge.", "description": "", "authors": ["Neil Gorsuch", "Time.Com Justice-Neil-Gorsuch-Why-Originalism-Is-The-Best-Approach-To-The-Constitution"], "top_image": ""}
