She warned against a repeat in Chile of the protests and political violence seen in Ecuador and Venezuela in recent months.\n\n\u201cToday is not the time to seek political advantage,\u201d she told reporters outside La Moneda presidential palace on Saturday morning. \u201cLet us be respectful, responsible and have faith in our armed forces.\u201d\n\nShe defended Pinera, who was photographed in an upmarket Italian restaurant on Friday evening as police and demonstrators clashed and firefighters battled blazes in multiple metro stations and the high-rise downtown headquarters of power utility Enel.\n\nThe pictures were met with fury on social media by commentators who said they were emblematic of a president - a billionaire businessman who introduced credit cards to Chile - who was out of touch with ordinary Chileans.\n\n\u201cThe president had been working since very early, concerned and busy with this,\u201d she said.\n\nGeneral Javier Iturriaga del Campo told a news conference at La Moneda in the early hours of Saturday that his troops would focus their patrols on \u201cthe most conflict-hit areas\u201d but would impose no curfew \u201cfor now.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said 179 people had been charged, 49 of them minors. Police told Reuters that on Friday alone, 156 police officers were injured, including five seriously. Forty-nine police cars were damaged and 41 metro stations vandalised.\n\nKarla Rubilar, the regional governor of Santiago, said by Saturday afternoon five buses had also been burned. City authorities confirmed schools would be shut on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nSeveral major supermarket chains, including Walmart\u2019s local Lider stores, closed early, along with major shopping malls, after fliers circulated on social media calling for raids on upmarket areas of the city.\n\nSporting and cultural events have been cancelled for the weekend, the metro network remains closed and foreign embassies have updated their security advisories for expatriates and visitors, urging them to avoid crowds and carry identification.\n\nIn Maipu, a working class area to the east of the city, police reinforced by soldiers fought running battles with protesters, local television news reported. Residents in the working class area of Cerro Navia said gunfire had been heard overnight. \u201cWe\u2019ve been shut up in our home and there are fires everywhere,\u201d one resident told Reuters.\n\nAlthough Chile has seen student-led protests in recent years that have sometimes turned violent, the severity of this week\u2019s clashes are unusual in what is normally one of the region\u2019s most stable countries.\n\nIn just over three weeks, Chile is due to host U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping along with many others for a regional summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. Weeks later, it will host other world leaders for the COP25 United Nations climate change summit.\n\nPolitical commentators and opposition parties have lambasted the response by Pinera\u2019s government, saying he should have sought dialogue with protesters instead of rolling out riot police.\n\nLucia Dammert, an expert in public security at the University of Santiago, wrote on Twitter: \u201cThe state of emergency is a measure of last resort, the government had many other tools available to it to calm things down.\u201d", "description": "Soldiers in armoured personnel carriers confronted demonstrators in one of Chilean capital Santiago's central squares on Saturday afternoon and shopping malls across the city were shut down as violent protests showed little sign of slowing.", "authors": ["Aislinn Laing", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
