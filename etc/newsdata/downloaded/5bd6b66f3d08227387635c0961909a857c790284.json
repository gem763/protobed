The opinions expressed here apply to all Democrats running in 2020. But for the sake of focus, let\u2019s dive right into the back and forth between Trump and Biden.\n\nTrump, who lives in a glass house, is somehow successfully throwing stones at Joe Biden. At the heart of his accusations is the notion that Biden used his political influence to secure lucrative deals for his son Hunter, including his $50,000-a-month board position at Ukrainian gas company Burisma.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile multiple investigations and reports indicate that the Bidens did nothing illegal, it\u2019s also true that Hunter Biden\u2019s position at a foreign gas company \u2014 along with the ridiculously high pay he received \u2014 doesn\u2019t look good. Trump understands this, and he also knows that Americans cringe at any mention of political corruption by self-dealing politicians.\n\nTo be sure, Trump is latching onto accusations of corruption against the Bidens, and even claims that he\u2019s just trying to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d as a way to deflect from his own serious legal issues, including asking a foreign leader to meddle in the presidential election.\n\nBut until recently, Biden\u2019s response has been almost no response at all. Initially he chose the \u201cwhen they go low, we go high\u201d route, which clearly did nothing to salvage Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPoll: Trump gains among independents against Biden, Warren Hillary Clinton calls Trump's Syria pullout a 'sickening betrayal' of allies Where are questions of economic and political inequality in the Democratic debates? MORE\u2019s 2016 campaign. Then he put out a mildly fiery speech in Reno, Nevada, followed by an op-ed in the Washington Post.\n\nIt\u2019s still not good enough. Playing defense in this election is a devastatingly weak move. Democratic candidates need to call out Trump\u2019s own abuses of power for self-enrichment purposes. And since Trump has made clear that he will relentlessly go after family, it only makes sense to draw attention to the overwhelming nepotism in the White House.\n\nThe president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump Ivana (Ivanka) Marie Trump Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Google committing to White House job training initiative To win the federal paid family leave debate, allow states to lead the way MORE, who has no experience in politics or policy, currently serves as his senior adviser.

Could it be that her father\u2019s political power swayed the decision?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe there\u2019s Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner Jared Corey KushnerMark Hamill zings Ivanka Trump for 'Star Wars' tweet Trump officials mull plan to divert billions more to border wall: report California trip shows Trump doesn't always hate the media MORE, who also serves as a senior advisor to the president. While his very unearned existence in the White House demonstrates that Trump is guilty of the same claims he makes about Biden, it\u2019s also worth noting that the Kushner family tried to cash in on their newly gained political power the second Trump took office. Kushner Companies used the EB-5 visa program to seduce foreigners to invest in their U.S.-based real estate.\n\nIn China, Kushner Companies presented a brochure that read, \u201cInvest $500,000 and immigrate to the United States.\u201d The abuse of power was so brazen that it led to an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThen, of course, you have Donald Trump himself, who encourages foreign leaders to book rooms at his properties, and constantly advertises his resorts while suggesting that political events like the G7 take place in them.\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget how Trump specifically wrote his 2017 tax cut proposal in a way that would benefit himself and his family the most. Aside from the obvious tax cuts the Trump family would enjoy, he also included goodies for the rich who want to permanently defer their capital gains taxes in exchange for real estate investments.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration is dripping with criminality, corruption, nepotism and self-enrichment. The only problem is that Democratic candidates refuse to strike back. Every time he hits them, they should hit him twice as hard. If you can't land devastating counter-strikes against the most corrupt president we have ever had, then you probably shouldn't be in this race.\n\nAna Kasparian is a host and executive producer of The Young Turks, and host of No Filter on TYT.", "description": "Trump, who lives in a glass house, is somehow successfully throwing stones at Joe Biden.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bidenjoe_100219getty_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
