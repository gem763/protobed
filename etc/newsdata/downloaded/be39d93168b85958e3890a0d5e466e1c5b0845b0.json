The indices gapped higher on yet another headline about progress on trade. No one takes this news very seriously but it causes computer algorithms to react immediately and that leads to some reverberations.\n\nThe action this morning is mostly index driven. The buyers are buying ETFs or large baskets of stocks and are not concerned with individual stock picking. They simply want to 'put on some increased risk' for a brief period to catch some upside.\n\nThe index-driven nature of the action is very apparent when you look at the action in individual stocks. When I run a scan of all stocks in the market that are making big positive moves on increased volume the list is quite short. There are less than 20 stocks that are up more than 5%.\n\nIn strong markets, that are not index driven, there tend to be pockets of momentum. Traders gravitate toward the individual stocks that are moving the most and those 'hot' stocks will show up in the scans that I run. While there is strength today there are few 'hot' individual stocks which tells us that this movement is index driven.\n\nConsumer confidence and the Richmond Fed numbers came in weaker than expected which reversed the early strength but the indices are still in positive territory.\n\nSmall caps - (IWM) - are lagging badly which is reflected in breadth of around 3700 gainers to 3100 decliners. This is not market action that is leading to the chasing of strength.\n\nThis sort of index driven action can broaden into better stock picking but the bigger danger is that the indices will continue to jerk the overall market around and make it very difficult to focus on individual stocks.", "description": "While there is strength today there are few 'hot' individual stocks....IWM", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "An Index Driven Market Is Not A Positive Sign", "While There Is Strength Today There Are Few 'Hot' Individual Stocks.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Bruce Kamich", "Jim Cramer", "Chris Versace", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/5e458f8a-f719-11e8-b7c9-3f93a4f6faef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
