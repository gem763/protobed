Since then, it has counted as one of Germany\u2019s most exclusive clubs with a membership that has included the likes of Helmut Kohl and Angela Merkel, as well as the CEOs of the country\u2019s largest companies.\n\nGiven that history, many wondered why the German political and business elites behind Atlantik Br\u00fccke would risk making the already fraught relationship with the U.S. even worse by choosing as its leader someone who, as a German minister, had been a vocal critic of U.S. policy on everything from the Middle East to Russia.\n\n\u201cHe would be a disaster,\u201d one veteran member told POLITICO when Gabriel\u2019s name first emerged in February.\n\nGabriel\u2019s boosters argued he is one of the few available Germans with the stature to fulfill the prominent role. The longtime leader of the Social Democrats, Gabriel held the position of vice chancellor and served as economy and then foreign minister in Merkel\u2019s Cabinet, leaving the latter job after a party power struggle in 2018.\n\nCan a provocateur like Gabriel (he once referred to Israel as an \u201capartheid regime\u201d) effectively lead the debate?\n\nUltimately, the weight of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 prevailed and Gabriel, 59, won approval as Atlantik Br\u00fccke\u2019s chairman by a clear majority in late June, overcoming a last-minute mini revolt by some members.\n\nEven so, doubts about his suitability for the role continue to dog him.\n\nIn a recent interview over sandwiches at Atlantik Br\u00fccke headquarters, which is housed in a small baroque palace overlooking Berlin\u2019s museum quarter, Gabriel made clear he thrives on the tension.\n\n\u201cWhat drew me to this job is that the relationship is so difficult at the moment,\u201d he said.\n\nBut can a provocateur like Gabriel (he once referred to Israel an \u201capartheid regime\u201d) effectively lead the debate?\n\nHis supporters say yes, arguing that with Trump as president, appointing the outspoken Gabriel to fight Germany\u2019s corner could turn out to be a masterstroke.\n\nWhile Gabriel stressed that Atlantik Br\u00fccke isn\u2019t a substitute government, its role as an informal forum, where leaders from both sides of the Atlantic can quietly meet and discuss the issues of the day, arguably makes the group more important than ever.\n\nOnce a year, for example, NATO\u2019s supreme allied commander visits Atlantik Br\u00fccke to debate security priorities with members and the German army\u2019s senior officers. Topping the agenda in recent years has been Russia, a subject with which Gabriel is quite familiar.\n\nJust not in the way Washington would like.\n\nWhether the question is Russian sanctions, which Gabriel has suggested loosening, or the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which he endorses, Gabriel's position is typically at odds with that of the U.S.\n\nAfter Moscow confiscated a Ukrainian ship and took its crew prisoner in the Kerch Strait last fall, Gabriel accused Kiev, which had asked for Western support, of \u201ctrying to drag us into a war.\u201d\n\nRussia, right or wrong\n\nA prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, the former German chancellor who now works for state-owned Russian gas giant Gazprom and is a close friend of Vladimir Putin, Gabriel adheres to the traditional view of his Social Democratic Party that no matter how bad things get, engaging Russia is preferable to isolating it.\n\nGabriel insists his true allegiance lies with the U.S., which he says is and should remain Germany's most important partner outside Europe.\n\nHis soft approach to Russia \u2014 Gabriel joined Schr\u00f6der and Putin for dinner in St. Petersburg in 2017 and is one of the few German politicians to grant interviews to Kremlin-backed media outlet RT \u2014 has earned him a reputation for being a Russlandversteher, a German pejorative for sympathizers of Putin\u2019s Russia.\n\nIt\u2019s a label he wears with pride.\n\n\u201cMy hope would be that anyone involved in international politics would try to understand the countries they\u2019re talking to,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also pointed out his record of publicly standing up to Russia when it comes to defending Western values. During a tense press conference in Moscow with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in 2017, for example, Gabriel offered a spirited defense of Western democracy and cautioned Russia not to intervene in democratic elections.\n\nGabriel, who grew up in West Germany within sight of the East German border, insists his true allegiance lies with the U.S., which he says is and should remain Germany's most important partner outside Europe.\n\n\u201cI come from a generation that still knows how much we owe to the Americans,\u201d he said, recalling his childhood and service as a German soldier in the state of Lower Saxony. \u201cWe didn\u2019t feel in danger and that was because we knew there was someone there to guarantee our freedom.\u201d\n\nEven though he remains deeply critical of Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and his overall treatment of U.S. allies, Gabriel said he supports some aspects of the American president\u2019s agenda, which he believes many of his compatriots are too quick to dismiss.\n\n\"It\u2019s not the case that everything Trump says is false,\u201d he said, pointing to Trump\u2019s efforts to negotiate a peace deal with North Korea. \u201cIt\u2019s worth considering the substance of what he\u2019s saying instead of taking the easy route and just getting upset over the way he expresses himself.\u201d\n\nCase in point: Germany\u2019s trade surplus, the world\u2019s largest. Trump (along with the International Monetary Fund, the OECD and the European Commission) has lambasted Germany for failing to temper its export surpluses, which critics argue contribute to global imbalances.\n\n\u201cThe OECD and the Americans are absolutely right about the imbalances on trade and finance,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cThere\u2019s only one group of economists that has argued for 20 years that the trade surplus is positive and funnily enough they all speak German.\u201d\n\nDon't blame Trump\n\nGabriel said Germans are wrong to blame Trump alone for the shift in the transatlantic relationship, arguing that the roots run much deeper. After the Cold War, it was inevitable that the U.S. would at some point begin to shift its attention to other priorities, such as China.\n\n\u201cNow we have an American president who says things can\u2019t continue in the same way they\u2019ve been for the past 70 years, but we could have figured that out earlier,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, such overtures have failed to impress U.S. officials, who remain skeptical of Gabriel\u2019s record of opposing higher German defense spending (he has called NATO's 2 percent of GDP defense spending target \"absurd\") and what they view as his cozy relationship with Putin.\n\nGabriel sought the endorsement of U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell during his run for the Atlantik Br\u00fccke post but was rebuffed. The two haven\u2019t spoken since.\n\n\u201cHere is the real problem: In contrast to every other president before him, Trump has created the impression that partnership amongst equals isn\u2019t desired\u201d \u2014 Sigmar Gabriel\n\nLast week, Gabriel suggested Grenell is ill-suited for the role as ambassador, telling Der Spiegel that Germany needs a U.S. ambassador who could act as a \"facilitator\" and explain Berlin's viewpoint to Washington.\n\nRelations between Atlantik Br\u00fccke and the Trump administration were frosty long before Gabriel arrived on the scene, however. As a bastion of the German establishment, the Atlantik Br\u00fccke represents the very \u201cglobalist\u201d forces Trump built his presidential campaign opposing.\n\nAsked by a German newspaper for his opinion of Grenell, Friedich Merz, a conservative politician who preceded Gabriel as Atlantik Br\u00fccke chief, responded: \u201cI have nothing to say about this man.\u201d\n\nNot on the record, anyway. Atlantik Br\u00fccke\u2019s leadership was so frustrated by the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to engage with them that they bestowed their most prestigious honor, the Eric Warburg Prize, named for one the group\u2019s founders, on Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland in December. It is the first time the award had gone to a Canadian in its 30-year history.\n\nGabriel said the only way to repair the transatlantic bond is to reinvent it. That means Europe, and Germany in particular, will have to take more initiative. Even then, U.S. engagement in Europe remains essential.\n\n\u201cHere is the real problem: In contrast to every other president before him, Trump has created the impression that partnership amongst equals isn\u2019t desired,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cI would answer that the idea of having partners and allies has been the multiplier of American power for more than 70 years. That is the reason I think that President Trump\u2019s bowling-alone strategy is not in the interest of the U.S. and its citizens.\u201d\n\nThe deep business and cultural ties should compel both sides to continue to work closely together, despite the changing nature of the relationship, Gabriel argued. To hope, as some Germans do, things would \u201creturn to normal\u201d if Trump loses the 2020 election was unrealistic, he added. Amid the shifting global power dynamics, the U.S. will inevitably become less focused on Europe.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that Germany and Europe will take on more responsibility and there will be a true partnership with the U.S. based on trust, not on blind devotion,\u201d he said.", "description": "Sigmar Gabriel\u2019s ties to Russia make him an unlikely bridge between Berlin and Washington.", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig", "Joshua Posaner"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-919226498-1200x628.jpg"}
