That\u2019s really all I can say about it.\u201d\n\nWhile Belichick may have been done talking about it, the rest of the country was not and questions about the decision persisted throughout the offseason even after Butler left New England and signed with the Tennessee Titans.\n\nWhether he wanted to admit it or not, Belichick\u2019s image had taken a big hit, not just on the national stage but also, more importantly, with the players in his locker room.\n\nBut he realized it and did something about it \u2014 and Antonio Brown being the newest member of the New England Patriots is the latest example of it.\n\nInstead of \u201cNo days off,\u201d Belichick returned the following season with the philosophy, stated or not, of \u201cNo, days off.\u201d\n\nDuring training camp last year, players were kept on the practice field less than ever before in Belichick\u2019s tenure with many veterans regularly being given rest days. Belichick relaxed the practice schedule so much that one Monday when players showed up for a voluntary organized team activity, they were taken to Fenway Park for a few hours of bonding and team building instead of hitting the practice field.\n\nThe lightened practice schedule has only continued this season.\n\nMichael Bennett, who was added to the roster during the offseason, was excused from showing up at the start of training camp for personal reasons, something which would have been unheard of during Belichick\u2019s tenure in the past\n\nSpeaking with reporters when he finally showed up, Bennett went out of his way to praise Belichick for his relaxed approach in the matter.\n\n\u201cI was lucky,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cCoach Belichick \u2013 it\u2019s nice when you have a coach that sees you as a human, sees you as a human being, not just a number, and you\u2019re able to go talk to him, tell him what\u2019s going on, and you\u2019re able to go take care of it. That just makes you want to play harder for a coach. When he believes in you, and lets you take care of your family first. I think everybody\u2019s always concerned about how their boss is going to take into consideration if something happens back home, but when you have a boss who respects you as a man, it\u2019s easy to go out there and play for him like that. I think for me, that\u2019s easy to look him in the eye and whatever he asks me to do, I\u2019ll do it simply because I know he respects me as a human being and I respect that.\u201d\n\nBelichick respecting his players and treating them like men doesn\u2019t exactly sound like him \u2013 but that\u2019s exactly the point.\n\nSince benching Butler, Belichick has realized he needed to change his ways if he wants to keep winning at the level he has become accustomed to. To get his players to play harder, he\u2019s softened up and agreeing to pay Antonio Brown $10 million in guaranteed money is the ultimate example of that.\n\nBy signing Brown to that guaranteed cash, Belichick has made it clear to the players in his locker room that he is willing to go all-in with a player who clearly does not fit the traditional mold of the Patriot Way. To get the most out of Brown, Belichick is going to have to coddle him, prop up his fragile ego and let him miss the occasional practice or team meeting.\n\nPrior to benching Butler, there\u2019s little evidence to indicate Belichick would have been willing to do those things. But it\u2019s a whole different ballgame now under Chill Bill.\n\nClearly, it\u2019s a gamble. But if Brown can help Belichick deliver his seventh Super Bowl to the Patriots and completely erase the memory of the Butler benching, it\u2019s worth it. Even if Brown and the team fall short, Belichick still gets credit for being willing to roll the dice on a player he likely would have avoided in the past.\n\nIt\u2019s a win-win situation for Belichick \u2014 and that\u2019s the real Patriot Way.", "description": "Belichick signing Brown is the latest example of the coach doing his best to rehab him image with the players in his locker room.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-632616456.jpg?fit=1024%2C683", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
