(AP) - USA Volleyball has named Dr. Peter Vint as its Chief of Sport.\n\nVint will oversee all of USA Volleyball\u2019s national teams, as well as the high performance and coaching education departments.\n\nUSA Volleyball CEO Jamie Davis says the newly created position will streamline the path from the high-performance programs to the national teams.\n\nVint says it was watching the U.S. men win the Olympic gold medal in 1984 that inspired him to enter the field of sport science. He spent 10 years working with the USOPC, most recently as the senior director of competitive analysis, research and innovation.\n\nIn 2016, Vint was hired by Everton Football Club as the Premier League\u2019s first American-born academy director. More recently, he was the performance director for the INEOS 1:59 Challenge, an exhibition in which world-record holder Eliud Kipchoge became the first person to run the marathon distance in under 2 hours.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "USA Volleyball has named Dr. Peter Vint as its Chief of Sport.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
