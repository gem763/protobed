Environmental activists protesting outside government buildings in October.

All true, the rain particularly. Ireland\u2019s most populous city is in the midst of massive change; a decade after the 2008 recession, a graffiti-centric arts scene has emerged, as has a newfound social awareness (the country recently repealed the Eighth Amendment, an abortion ban, and in 2017 Ireland became the first country to legalize gay marriage by vote). While the city\u2019s cultural history remains one of its main draws (the massive Museum of Literature opened in late September), people across the world have found themselves obsessed with a new crop of Irish cultural exports (Derry Girls and novels from Tana French and Sally Rooney overtook the summer of 2019). With numerous international companies choosing Dublin as their European HQ (Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Slack among them), the city has become increasingly multinational: These days, you\u2019ll find a Brazilian corner store as easily as you\u2019ll find a pokey \u201cold man\u201d pub on the city center\u2019s main drag. Chefs are reimagining traditional fare (crubeens \u2014 here, roasted pig\u2019s tail \u2014 are being stuffed with lobster and razor clams) and introducing new categories of food altogether: A formerly brunchless city is seeing a surge of morning menus boasting fluffy pancakes with apple syrup and sausages.\n\n1. A Day-to-Night in Stoneybatter\n\nMany of the street names in this on-the-up-and-up northside enclave (Sigurd Road, Thor Place, Ivar Street) recall the era (ca. A.D. 841) when the neighborhood\u2019s primary inhabitants were Vikings. Here\u2019s how longtime resident and Today FM radio DJ Ed Smith would spend an ideal day toodling around.\n\n11 a.m.\n\nI\u2019d first head to Maureen\u2019s (Manor Pl., Arran Quay), probably the most famous \u2014 or maybe infamous \u2014 convenience store in the neighborhood. She is a true Stoneybatter legend; you never know what mood you\u2019ll find her in. Then pick up a newspaper and head down to Cowtown Cafe (73 Manor St.) for a Breakfast Bap, a soft, floury roll with sausage, bacon, pudding, and egg, all beautifully fried, with a nice mug of proper Irish tea.\n\n1 p.m.\n\nI\u2019d then go to the nearby Phoenix Park for a ramble through the trees. Walk up the main stretch, Chesterfield Avenue, and pass \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in, the president\u2019s house. On the way back, head up to Arbour Hill, where there\u2019s a quirky market run by a sweet old guy, Peter, that nobody knows about. He opens up his shed and sells trumpets, amp stands, guitars, vintage radios, and a vinyl collection.\n\n3 p.m.\n\nStop off at the Green Door Bakery on Manor Street; they do a fantastic Bakewell slice. Directly across the road is Mooz (1 Manor St.), an Italian grocer that does phenomenal coffee. Take a cup to the Irish United Nations Veterans Association Garden (Mount Temple Rd.), which you enter through a secret blue door. It\u2019s beautiful and just beside Arbour Hill Cemetery \u2014 which is a very historical spot as a lot of the lads from the 1916 rebellion are buried there.\n\n6 p.m.\n\nFor dinner, go to a Vietnamese food truck called Vietnom at the back of the Glimmer Man pub (14 Stoneybatter). It is probably the most eccentric pub in Stoneybatter \u2014 it\u2019s like the bar from Star Wars. Or try Grano for some authentic Italian. There\u2019s literally an Italian grandmother in the back making proper hearty fare.\n\n9 p.m.\n\nMy favorite pub is Walsh\u2019s (6 Stoneybatter). Anto the barman will look after you there \u2014 it has the best pint of Guinness in the country. That\u2019s right, the country. If you fancy a craft beer, on the other hand, you can\u2019t beat L. Mulligan Grocer (18 Stoneybatter), a.k.a. Mulligan\u2019s.\n\nMidnight\n\nOn the way home, you\u2019ve gotta pop into Sorrento (10B Arbour Hill) for a bag of chips. They\u2019re outrageous. There\u2019s a guy in there called Christian who even does his own homemade gelatos.\n\n2. Not the Usual Restaurants and Bars\n\nGertrude. Photo: Courtesy of Vendor\n\nContemporary takes on Irish classics, recommended by chef Damien Grey, owner of Liath.\n\nFor Brunch: Gertrude, 130 Pearse St.\n\n\u201cDublin has a newfound brunch scene that has emerged only in the past couple of years. For my money, I especially love the Gertrude Stack: big, fluffy pancakes finished with Highbank Orchard apple syrup and these sausages from Whole Hoggs, which uses a free-range rare-breed pig. They also fire in a little sneaky hot sauce, too.\u201d\n\nFor Dinner: Chapter One, 19 Parnell Sq.\n\n\u201cYears ago, you would cook down the crubeens, the feet of the pig. Chapter One uses the pig\u2019s tail instead of the feet and stuffs it with lobsters when they\u2019re in season or razor clams. Then it\u2019s glazed with this really thick treacle, and fresh apples and sorrel are put on it. It\u2019s just such a divine dish.\u201d\n\nFor Dessert: Mr. Fox, 38 Parnell Sq. W.\n\n\u201cAnthony Smith plays on people\u2019s memories of \u201980s and \u201990s sweets. They do ice creams like Brunch (a traditional U.K. ice-cream bar covered with biscuit crumbs), and a fantastic Walnut Whip (named after the popular-in-Ireland chocolate and whipped-vanilla candies). They really play on nostalgia; when you\u2019re eating them, it\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah! I remember this!\u2019 It\u2019s the stuff everyone remembers from when they were kids, and it\u2019s done so well.\u201d\n\nAnd some worthwhile Guinness alternatives, according to Beth Berry, mixologist at the Lucky Duck.\n\nGold Bar. Photo: Killian Broderick/Killian Broderick\n\nFor an Unaged Whiskey: Bar 1661, 5 Green S.\n\n\u201cBar 1661, a new poit\u00edn (an unaged spirit) bar on the north side of Dublin, is small and cozy. It\u2019d be a crime not to go for their house spirit; they do a poit\u00edn flight with a selection of whiskeys.\u201d\n\nFor a Gin\u2013and\u2013Pea Cordial Cocktail: 9 Below, 9 St. Stephen\u2019s Green\n\n\u201cPeople describe 9 Below as a speakeasy because it\u2019s hard to find. Find the sign on the gate, go down the steps, and you\u2019re suddenly in one of the most luxurious bars in the city, with unusual cocktails like the On the Green, a mix of gin, green chartreuse, a pea cordial, and egg white.\u201d\n\nFor a Potent Drink: Gold Bar, 20 Lower Camden St.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on the top floor of a Chinese restaurant called Hang Dai. Their tequila and mezcal range is incomparable, but if you\u2019re feeling brave, try the Death-Proof Chinese Zombie \u2014 they limit it to two per guest per night.\u201d\n\n3. If You Want to Rile up a Dubliner\n\nBring up \u2026\n\nRising Rents\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar conundrum: The big companies (in this case, Silicon Valley transplants) move in, the rents go up, and the locals are forced out. Leo Varadkar\u2019s government has been criticized for failing to take measures to both avoid and solve this problem; homelessness is now at epidemic levels, and housing prices are unattainable for many (the average cost in Dublin\u2019s city center is now over $2,000 a month).\n\nBrexit\n\nIreland\u2019s history with the U.K. is long and complicated \u2014 and it\u2019s set to get even messier with the looming threat of Brexit. It\u2019s unclear how this will affect the capital, but reports have suggested that a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit will have a damaging effect on the home sales and rental markets. There is fear that the expected influx of companies and workers from the U.K. will deepen the housing crisis and impact residents\u2019 day-to-day lives\u2014from decreasing discretionary shopping to the possibility of a return to the turbulence that ended under the Good Friday peace agreement.\n\nCultural Erosion\n\nMany Dubliners have been angered by what they see as the \u201ccultural erosion\u201d of their city \u2014 buildings being knocked down and redeveloped as hotels, making for a place that increasingly favors tourists over locals. Recently, the Dublin City Council voted to limit the number of hotels being built in a bid to stem the tide, but many people think it\u2019s too little, too late.\n\n4. Where Locals Would Stay\n\nIf they weren\u2019t locals.\n\nKelly\u2019s Hotel. Photo: Courtesy of Vendor\n\n$\n\nKelly\u2019s Hotel\n\n36 S. Great George\u2019s St., from $88 a night\n\n\u201cThis 16-room hotel located in the Creative Quarter has a rustic feel \u2014 brick walls, exposed beams \u2014 and a popular-with-locals rooftop bar. Step outside and you\u2019ve got great record stores, caf\u00e9s, independent art galleries, and traditional pubs on your doorstep.\u201d \u2014Ruth Medjber, photographer\n\n$$\n\nThe Hendrick\n\n6\u201311 Hendrick St., Smithfield, from $110 a night\n\n\u201cIt feels practically like a gallery \u2014 there\u2019s interesting graffiti and paintings on nearly every wall of the place\u2019s five floors, from people like painter Conor Harrington, street artists Maser and Sam Le Bas, and abstractionist James Kirwan. The rooms also happen to be incredibly comfortable, and the city center is within walking distance.\u201d \u2014Brandon Felczer, co-owner of Token barcade\n\nThe Westbury Hotel. Photo: Courtesy of Vendor\n\n$$$\n\nThe Westbury Hotel\n\nBalfe St., from $327 a night\n\n\u201cFor a five-star hotel, it\u2019s warm, unstuffy, and welcoming with a real buzz, especially on weekends. The location couldn\u2019t be better \u2014 tucked away from the main thoroughfare but right near Grafton Street. The Art Deco interiors are luxe but cozy, the perfect refuge on a rainy Dublin day. Try the afternoon tea in the Gallery or a cocktail in the Sidecar bar.\u201d \u2014Aoife Kelleher, film and television director\n\n5. Art Three Ways\n\nAn equine-themed mural on Stirrup Lane, 20th-century paintings in a former hospital, and a perfectly preserved artist\u2019s studio.\n\nThe Irish Museum of Modern Art. Photo: ROS KAVANAGH\n\n1. \u201cSubset are a really interesting collective of street artists, but they\u2019re constantly running into conflict with the city\u2019s planning authorities. Try to see their #Horseboy (corner of Church St. and Stirrup Ln.) before it disappears \u2014 the mural has become one of the most popular fixtures in the Smithfield area.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cThe Irish Museum of Modern Art (Military Rd., Kilmainham) was launched in 1990 at the 40-acre former Royal Hospital Kilmainham. The collection centers on Irish art from the mid-20th century on. Nextdoor is a hidden gem, the Irish National War Memorial Gardens, a riverside park with formal gardens designed by Edwin Lutyens.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cFrancis Bacon\u2019s art studio was picked up and moved from London to Dublin (Charlemont House, Parnell Square N., Rotunda) in 1998. Everything from the walls to the ceiling to the medical books and magazines strewn around the place was perfectly preserved as it was when he died in the early \u201990s.\u201d\n\n\u2014Patrick Murphy, RHA Gallery\n\n6. The Bookstore Mentioned in \u2018Ulysses\u2019\n\nAnd two others, recommended by author Sin\u00e9ad Gleeson.\n\nBooks Upstairs. Photo: memymoxxs/Instagram\n\nBooks Upstairs, 17 D\u2019Olier St.\n\n\u201cThis long-standing shop can\u2019t be bettered on its excellent range of literary journals, zines, magazines, and its particularly excellent essay section.\u201d\n\nMarrowbone Books, 78 the Coombe\n\n\u201cDublin was once home to thriving secondhand bookshops; dim rooms full of dusty spines. There are less of them around, but this small shop in the Coombe is full of old Penguins and pre-loved paperbacks.\u201d\n\nHodges Figgis, 56\u201358 Dawson St.\n\n\u201cThe oldest bookshop in Dublin (it was founded in 1768 and mentioned in Ulysses) has a lovely old-fashioned-looking fa\u00e7ade, behind which lie four floors of new books and a great bargain basement.\u201d\n\n7.

William St.\n\n\u201cTheir signature drink is their mocha, and it\u2019s unbelievable \u2014 high-quality chocolate that they put on the end of a stick so you can melt it into your coffee.\u201d\n\nFor Books and Vinyl: The Secret Book & Record Store, 15a Wicklow St.\n\n\u201cIt has a big selection of secondhand books and is a bit old and cluttered, which makes it very charming. In the same shop, Freebird Records has a great range of vinyl and CDs.\u201d\n\nFor a Party in the Back of a Japanese Restaurant: Yamamori Tengu, 37 Great Strand St.\n\n\u201cAt night, this Japanese restaurant becomes a club. The best student nights happen here \u2014 they host great Irish DJs.\u201d\n\n8. Day Trips That Are Worth It\n\nGo inside a Stone Age passage tomb.\n\nThe Hill of Tara. Photo: MNStudio/Alamy/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nLess than an hour\u2019s drive from Dublin\n\nHistory buffs will especially appreciate a visit to Newgrange, the Stone Age passage tomb and World Heritage Site that was rediscovered in the late-17th century. As any Irish person will proudly tell you, it\u2019s older than both the Egyptian pyramids and Stonehenge \u2014 and just as impressive. While you\u2019re in the Boyne Valley area, take in the Hill of Tara, the seat of Ireland\u2019s ancient high kings.\n\nPhoto: santiherca/Instagram\n\nStroll Along the Irish Coastline\n\n45-minute train ride from Dublin\n\nIrish winter weather is notoriously unpredictable, but on a clear day, it\u2019s hard to beat the ever-popular Bray-to-Greystones cliff walk. The rugged but accessible trail linking the two seaside villages offers stunning views across the Irish Sea while snaking up Bray Head along a heather-strewn path for four miles. Upon arrival in Greystones, dine at vegetarian caf\u00e9 the Happy Pear.\n\nSpend the Day in a Playground for Grown-ups\n\n30 minutes by car from the city center\n\nYou could easily while away a day at Jam Park in Swords, just outside the city center. The multipurpose venue (a former nightclub) is now owned and operated by the hip Bodytonic group. In addition to restaurants (get the cauliflower tacos!) and several bars, you\u2019ll find Ping-Pong, miniature golf, arcade games, karaoke, and even a market on Sundays.\n\n*This article appears in the October 28, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
