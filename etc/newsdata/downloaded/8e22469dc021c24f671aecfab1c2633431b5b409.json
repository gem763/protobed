He had told The New York Times it was his right to travel to Ukraine to \"defend\" his client \u2014 to try to push for investigations he thought could be \"very helpful\" to the president.\n\nThe New Jersey senator also wrote to Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Mick Mulvaney to ask him to explain to Congress why it failed to take action on Ukraine's security assistance funding for over two months.\n\n\"As it is becoming clear that the president in fact pressured Ukrainian officials, we must immediately understand whether, and to what extent, the president and his team converted duly-appropriated United States foreign assistance funds for his personal and political benefit,\" Mendendez pressed.", "description": "Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Bob Menendez wrote to the State Department watchdog to ask for a review of the matter", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/04/02/b374e86e-a466-4543-8c16-eaef022e7f85/thumbnail/1200x630/71d1a55fe785661ab59350e45ab00a0c/468394930.jpg"}
