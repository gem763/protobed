I\u2019m not suggesting that there is a Nixonian \u201cmissing tape\u201d here, but let\u2019s not forget how misleading the Barr memo was when compared to the Mueller report.\n\nSecond, we have yet to see the complete unredacted whistleblower complaint. What we do know about it is that the Inspector General of the intelligence community deemed it to be \u201curgent\u201d and \u201cserious.\u201d\n\nThird, the transcript covers one phone call. We do not know if there were other calls with Trump\u2014or his associates. What we do know is that Trump suggests that President Volodymyr Zelensky should cooperate with Rudy Giuliani, his personal attorney, and take a call from Attorney General Barr, when they reach out to him. In fact, this is a central theme of the transcript.\n\nDid these calls take place? What was said on these calls?\n\nFourth, Trump does ask Zelensky to \u201clook into\u201d the controversy swirling about the son of Trump\u2019s main domestic political rival, Joe Biden. \u201cThere is a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that,\u201d Trump said, according to the transcript.\n\nRegarding Biden\u2019s son, Trump continued, \u201cwhatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump spends a lot of time talking about how good America has been to Ukraine, and although Trump then asks the Ukrainian president for a \u201cfavor,\u201d there is no clear or explicit quid pro quo.\n\nThere doesn\u2019t have to be. When the president of the United States of America calls you\u2014and you are waiting for a $391 million aid package from him\u2014the power dynamic suggests that you should do what you know he wants you to do.\n\nBut the truth is that nobody sane should have expected to find a clear quid pro quo here. That\u2019s not how Trump works. As Michael Cohen said, Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t give orders. He speaks in code.\u201d\n\nThe point is that the quid pro quo, such as it exists, was implicit. But even without that, asking a foreign power to help damage your domestic political rival would be impeachable, regardless of whether a quid pro quo exists at all.\n\n\u201c At this point, any Republican defending Trump is probably beyond redemption. \u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s the standard you set, though, this (not verbatim) transcript might be seen as anticlimactic. In a sense, though, it\u2019s impossible to imagine the White House releasing a transcript that included a clear quid pro quo.\n\nWhat this is, however, is damning enough to begin an impeachment inquiry to see whether enough evidence exists for the House to pass articles officially accusing the president of an impeachable offense, thus sending it to the Senate for conviction.\n\nT his transcript does not exist in a vacuum. Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani have already essentially conceded that they traded on the prestige of the White House (which Trump does not personally own) to coerce a foreign power into helping go after Trump\u2019s chief domestic political rival.\n\nIf Barack Obama had done anything this egregious, Republicans would be echoing my sentiments.\n\nAt this point, any Republican defending Trump is probably beyond redemption.\n\nSince asking Republicans to do the right thing based on principle or the rule of law has proven fruitless, I have resigned myself to try a new message: Help me make Mike Pence president!", "description": "Death knell?
