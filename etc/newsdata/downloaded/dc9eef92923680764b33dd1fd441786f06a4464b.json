She gave the former Dallas police officer her Bible, telling her \u201cthis is your job for the next month. Right here . . . He has a purpose for you. This will strengthen you. You just need a tiny mustard seed of faith. You start with this.\u201d The two then embraced as Kemp told Guyger, \u201cYou haven\u2019t done as much as you think you have, and you can be forgiven. You did something bad in one moment in time. What you do now matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe understand that it was an emotional moment, particularly when the victim\u2019s brother, Brandt Jean, publicly forgave and hugged Guyger,\u201d Freedom from Religion\u2019s letter reads. \u201c . . . But here, compassion crossed the line into coercion. And there can be few relationships more coercive than a sentencing judge in a criminal trial and a citizen accused and convicted of a crime.\u201d\n\nThe organization admits that it does not know whether or not Guyger is Christian, but claims that \u201cthe gesture would still have been inappropriate and unconstitutional because Judge Kemp was acting in her official governmental capacity.\u201d Referencing the Establishment Clause, Don Barker and Annie Laurie Gaylor, the co-presidents of the group who penned the letter, explain that \u201cit violates a vital constitutional principle for a sitting judge to promote personal religious beliefs while acting in her official capacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudge Kemp transmitted her personal religious beliefs as a state official in an official proceeding of the gravest nature, a setting that imposed on everyone in the courtroom: attorneys, staff, family members and the convicted,\u201d they state.\n\nThe announcement is not the first controversy to surface in the fallout after the trial. After the sentencing on Wednesday, Jean\u2019s mother addressed the media and stated \u201cThat ten years in prison is for reflection and for her to change her life. But there is much more to be done by the city of Dallas. The corruption we saw must stop.\u201d Later that night, The Dallas Morning News revealed the Dallas police department will undergo an internal review of incidents made public during the trial. On Friday, Dallas church leaders and community activists are expected to call on the Justice Department to examine policing practices in the city.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "The Freedom from Religion Foundation, a pro-atheist advocacy group, filed a complaint on Thursday with the Texas State Commission on Judicial Conduct objecting to \u201cproselytizing actions\u201d that \u201coverstepped judicial authority,\u201d after Judge Tammy Kemp handed a Bible to convicted former police officer Amber", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6uAs5wFhMCWxPipDKPtIoQ--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/fae115d06781028018bbe9cc752b9dd1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
