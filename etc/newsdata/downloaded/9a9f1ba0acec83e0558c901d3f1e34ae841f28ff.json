(Picture: REX, ITV)\n\nAfter five years on the Cobbles, Lucy will be bowing out of the show as Bethany Platt, and while the actress admitted she doesn\u2019t know what lies ahead for her character in her exit storyline, what could be lying ahead for Lucy is a trip Down Under.\n\nWith 9/4 odd from Ladbrokes and a source apparently telling The Sun that Lucy is expected to be a \u2018big hit\u2019 with fans at home and campmates, it seems like the star could be swapping Weatherfield for Australia\u2019s Gold Coast soon.\n\nCoronation Street\u2019s Alan Halsall\n\nThere\u2019s clearly something in the water in Weatherfield, as Coronation Street actor, Alan Halsall, who plays Tyrone Dobbs in the ITV soap is hotly tipped to be entering the jungle this year too.\n\nAlan Halsall has been hinting at a I\u2019m A Celebrity stint (Picture: @alanhalsall/Instagram, Getty)\n\nLadbrokes are offering EVENS odds on Alan heading into the jungle, suggesting they are pretty sure that the affable mechanic from Corrie is headed Down Under soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder the bets are on for Alan, as the star himself has even been dropping hints that he might be joining I\u2019m A Celeb this year.\n\nEastEnders\u2019 Jacqueline Jossa\n\nJacqueline Jossa, the former EastEnders\u2019 actress who played Lauren Branning in the BBC soap opera from 2010 to 2018, has been given 7/4 odds by Ladbrokes to enter the jungle this year.\n\nJacqueline Jossa may be heading Down Under if the rumours are true (Picture: Mark Cuthbert/UK Press via Getty Images)\n\nThe mum-of-two recently launched a brand new performing arts school in Bexleyheath that runs acting, singing and drama classes, as well as dance classes and self-confidence workshops.\n\nHowever, with no other acting roles listed in the near future for the actress, could Jacqueline be planning to leave husband Dan in charge of their family while she heads Down Under?\n\nEastEnders\u2019 Lacey Turner\n\nLacey Turner made an emotional exit from EastEnders back in August and hasn\u2019t been seen on the soap since as the actress is currently on maternity leave, having given birth to her first child in July.\n\nWould Lacey Turner cut short her maternity leave to join the I\u2019m A Celebrity line up? (Photo by John Phillips/Getty Images)\n\nThe actress welcomed a baby girl, called Dusty, with her husband over the summer.\n\nDespite the fact that she\u2019s still on maternity leave and not due back on our screens in EastEnders until at least next year, there\u2019s been rumours the 31-year-old could join the I\u2019m A Celeb line-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it seems unlikely the new mum will enter the camp this year, Ladbrokes have still given Lacey 7/4 odds on joining the show.\n\nEastEnders\u2019 Danny Dyer\n\nEastEnders\u2019 hard man Danny Dyer is yet another star from Albert Square rumoured to be swapping Walford for the jungle.\n\nThe Dyers could make I\u2019m A Celebrity a family affair this year (Picture: Brian J Ritchie/Hotsauce/REX)\n\nHis daughter in real life, Love Island winner Dani Dyer, is also rumoured to be entering the jungle and a father daughter face-off in one of the Bushtucker trials is definitely something we\u2019d be tuning in to see.\n\nHollyoaks\u2019 Jennifer Metcalfe\n\nMercedes McQueen actress Jennifer Metcalfe is also rumoured to have been considering signing up for I\u2019m A Celebrity, with the Hollyoaks star yet another small-screen regular said to be heading to Australia\u2019s Gold Coast to film for the reality TV series.\n\nJennifer Metcalfe is reportedly in talks for this year\u2019s jungle (Picture: ITV)\n\n\u2018Jen is perfect for the jungle, she\u2019s really funny and attractive and she loves a challenge,\u2019 a source told The Sun Online.\n\nHowever, with so many soap stars rumoured to be entering the jungle this year, only a handful of the rumours can be true \u2013 unless ITV producers are planning an I\u2019m A Celeb soap star special \u2013 which seems highly unlikely!\n\nHollyoaks\u2019 Duncan James\n\nFormer boyband member and Hollyoaks star Duncan James seemed to be in with a shot of joining the I\u2019m A Celeb line up this year and he was given 6/4 odds for entering the jungle.\n\nDuncan James has categorically denied I\u2019m A Celebrity rumours. (Picture: Getty)\n\nHowever, unfortunately, we won\u2019t be seeing this boy from Blue take on any bushtucker trials this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the rumours a spokesperson for Duncan clarified to Metro.co.uk that the rumours are: \u2018totally untrue.
