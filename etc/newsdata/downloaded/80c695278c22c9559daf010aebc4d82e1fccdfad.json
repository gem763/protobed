The Liberal government is also seeking a stay of the order. The Trudeau government also argued against compensation before the tribunal last spring.\n\nJustice Canada lawyers said in the October court filings that the tribunal overreached by ordering Ottawa to compensate First Nations children apprehended from their homes and communities through the on-reserve child welfare system, along with some of their parents and grandparents.\n\nNDP would push for public inquiry\n\nSony Perron, the associate deputy minister of Indigenous Services Canada, said in an affidavit that the order could cost the federal government up to $8 billion.\n\nIn 2016, the human rights tribunal found that Ottawa discriminated against First Nations children by underfunding on-reserve child welfare services.\n\nIn its Sept. 6 compensation ruling, the tribunal said that Ottawa prioritized financial considerations over the human rights of First Nations children.\n\nNDP candidate Charlie Angus says he wants to push for an inquiry into on-reserve child welfare. (Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press)\n\nThe NDP and the Green Party both have said Ottawa should accept the compensation order.\n\nFirst Nations leaders across the country criticized the Trudeau Liberals for challenging the tribunal order.\n\nIncumbent NDP candidate Charlie Angus said his party would to take the issue further by calling for a national inquiry into the on-reserve child welfare system.\n\n\"Children are literally dying, day in and day out. Once they're disappeared into the system, they seem to disappear from even mattering,\" said Angus, who is running for reelection in the northern Ontario riding of Timmins-James Bay.\n\n\"That is why I think an inquiry is needed. We've had inquest after inquest, we've heard report after report, yet the issue remains prevalent in all the northern communities.\"\n\nIn Ontario alone, 102 Indigenous children and youths died between 2013 and 2017 within 12 months after they or their families received services from the child welfare system, according to public data compiled by Ontario's Office of the Chief Coroner through its annual pediatric death review committee reports.\n\nThe Aboriginal Peoples Television Network was the first to report on the data.\n\nMary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, the former B.C. representative for children and youth, said the inquiry idea has merit. (CBC)\n\nMary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, the former child and youth advocate for British Columbia, said in an emailed statement to CBC News that the inquiry idea has merit.\n\n\"First, the impact on children of removal is such that their stories should be collected. Second, the deeper causes of harm need to be fully addressed,\" said Turpel-Lafond, currently the director of the Residential School History and Dialogue Centre at the University of British Columbia.\n\n\"Third, the issue of acceptance and support for those taken by the system is a major psychological issue related to trauma. In some cases, they are rejected by their own communities.\"\n\nCindy Blackstock, who heads the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, said she believes the focus should remain on implementing the rulings and orders of the human rights tribunal.\n\n\"I think we have the answers needed,\" said Blackstock, who led the human rights complaint in 2007 that resulted in the tribunal's landmark 2016 ruling.\n\n\"What needs to be done is to have the recommendations and legal orders that are on the books implemented.\"", "description": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Friday he supports compensation for First Nations children and families who \u201csuffered\u201d under the on-reserve child welfare system.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5324930.1571339918!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-conservatives-20191012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
