Lime Petroleum had agreed in June to acquire the stake, together with a 30 per cent interest in PL838B, another licence in the Norwegian Sea.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe operator PGNiG has a 40 per cent interest in both licences, while Aker BP holds the remaining 30 per cent.\n\nRegulatory approval for the transfer of interests in the two licences was obtained in September, and the transfer is set to be completed on Oct 31 and become effective from Jan 1.\n\nThe wells in PL838 were drilled in the central part of the Norwegian Sea, about five kilometres south of the Skarv FPSO (floating production storage and offloading) and 210 kilometres north-west of the Br\u00f8nn\u00f8ysund town.\n\n\u201cThe objective was to prove the existence of petroleum in Lower to Middle Jurassic reservoir rocks of the Fangst and B\u00e5t Groups,\u201d Rex said.\n\nIt is possible that the new field discovered will be tied back to the Skarv FPSO facility, the company added.\n\nDan Brostr\u00f6m, executive chairman of Rex, said: \u201cWe have based our decision to farm-in to PL838 on the interpretation from Rex Virtual Drilling and our own geological and geophysical studies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith this discovery, we will have the option to move towards production, or to repeat our proven business model in Norway to farm-in, find oil, monetise and recycle capital, as we have done with the Rolvsnes discovery,\u201d Mr Brostr\u00f6m added.\n\nThe drilling result in the Shrek prospect comes several months after Rex monetised the Rolvsnes discovery in the North Sea. Lime Petroleum had inked a deal in January to sell its 30 per cent interest in the Rolvsnes discovery in the PL338C licence as well as related assets for a cash consideration of US$43 million and a contingent payment of a further US$2 million\n\nShares of Rex International were trading up 0.8 Singapore cent or 10.1 per cent at 8.7 Singapore cents as at 9.04am on Wednesday, after the discovery was announced.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - CATALIST-LISTED oilfield services firm Rex International on Wednesday announced that an oil and gas discovery has been made from the drilling of exploration and appraisal wells in the Norwegian Sea. .
