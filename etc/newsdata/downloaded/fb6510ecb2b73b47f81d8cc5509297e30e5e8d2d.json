(Photo: Matthew Putney/AP)\n\nIowa State University acknowledged Monday that multiple people were injured when a fan tumbled from the upper deck of Jack Trice Stadium during Saturday\u2019s football game against Oklahoma State.\n\nA witness to the incident, Maury Ruble, 47, of Ogden, said he was sitting directly behind the fan who fell.\n\n\"He was really animated and conversational, just enjoying the game,\" Ruble recalled.\n\nRuble said Iowa State missed a possible interception sometime during the first quarter when the fall occurred.\n\n\"He stood up emphatically, leaning forward. I looked to my left at my wife and son real quick, and when I looked back there was a void where he was,\" Ruble said. \"It happened in an instant.\"\n\nThe gentleman sitting to the left of the fallen fan, according to Ruble, looked at him and said: \"He just went over.\"\n\n\"I was completely flabbergasted. It was unbelievable,\" Ruble said. \"There is no question that this was just a freak accident.\"\n\n\"Everyone in the section was looking around each other in disbelief, some had stood up to look over the railing to see what happened,\" Ruble said. Bystanders talked among themselves, putting the pieces together.\n\nRuble himself looked over the railing, and saw the man lying on his back with his legs \"kind of crossed\" at the ankles.\n\n\"My family has had tickets every year since Jack Trice has been open, since day one,\" Ruble said. \"I've seen a lot of things in the stadium, but nothing like this.\"\n\nIn an email to The Des Moines Register, Angie Hunt, interim director of the Iowa State University News Service, provided additional details from what was released Sunday.\n\n\u201cIowa State University is in contact with the individuals involved in an accident Saturday at Jack Trice Stadium.\n\n\u201cA fan fell from the second balcony on the stadium\u2019s east side in the first half of the football game versus Oklahoma State.
