It pulls in nearly 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) in annual revenue from abroad.\n\nHikvision temporarily suspended trading in its shares on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on Tuesday after the U.S. announcement.\n\nHu said the company had been communicating with various branches of the U.S. government about the situation in Xinjiang, and had hired human rights lawyers to defend itself.\n\n\"The U.S. government doesn't care at all about the things Hikvision is doing in Xinjiang,\" said Hu. \"The thing they care about is sanctions.\"", "description": "China's Hikvision sees only limited impact from U.S. blacklisting", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF980H6_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
