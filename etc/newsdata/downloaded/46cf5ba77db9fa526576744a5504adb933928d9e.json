It was so intense. Taking off the tough veneer and telling the truth has been my latest mission.'\n\nAnd she also shared some wisdom for her fans: 'When we're young and we're so driven by the follies of our youth, sometimes we can miss some of the great beauty and wonder of the simplicity of every day.'", "description": "Sharon Stone has starred in over 40 movies -including the classic thriller Basic Instinct - but still has her movie star good looks.
