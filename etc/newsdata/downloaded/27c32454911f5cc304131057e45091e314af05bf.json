Her bed is empty. The quiet is deafening,\u201d Kelly Cervantes wrote on Twitter. \u201cMiss Adelaide Grace left us early Saturday morning. She went peacefully in my arms and surrounded by love. Finally, she is free from pain, reactions and seizures but leaves our hearts shattered. We love you so much Adelaideybug and forever after.\u201d\n\nThe machines are off. Her bed is empty.

It is my turn to be the strongest ... and let you go,\u201d she said in the letter posted on her blog Inchstones.\n\nAdelaide Grace, who died just days short of her fourth birthday, had a severe form of epilepsy. She suffered her first seizure at the age of 7 months, and was diagnosed with infantile spasms two months later, People magazine reported.\n\nMiguel Cervantes, who plays the lead role in the Chicago production of \u201cHamilton,\u201d posted a sobbing emoji to his wife\u2019s message.\n\nEarlier this month, he posted a photo of the couple\u2019s 7-year-old son, Jackson, and their daughter making a mold of their intertwined hands. The mold is now featured on his Twitter profile.\n\nBoth Miguel and Kelly have been working to raise awareness and funds to help battle epilepsy. \u201cWe are fighting so that no one ever has to count how many seizures happen in a day,\u201d Miguel told Chicago\u2019s ABC7-TV early this month.\n\nKelly wrote on her blog: \u201cI want a cure for epilepsy. I want the fear that people have of talking about it, I want that fear to end. I want my baby girl to live, and I don\u2019t get that. So I\u2019m going to fight like hell for the rest of it.\u201d\n\nIn her letter to her daughter, she wrote: \u201cI promise you, my angel baby, that your efforts, your fight, your life will not have been in vain.\u201d", "description": "Adelaide Grace Cervantes died in a Chicago hospice \"surrounded by love\" after a long struggle with seizures.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da3dd1f2100005009acd7c8.jpeg?cache=vry2n1xvlz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
