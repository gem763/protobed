Netflix Rallies After Overseas Growth Eases Investor Worries\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: ). gave investors just enough good news Wednesday to let them to breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nThe shares rallied after the company posted slightly better-than-expected subscriber growth overseas in the third quarter, making up for a far smaller gain at home. Earnings also topped Wall Street estimates, helping investors look past a tepid forecast for the final quarter of the year.\n\nAfter a disappointing quarter three months ago, investors came in with lower expectations this time around. And Netflix (NASDAQ: ) cleared that bar, sending the shares up as much as 11% in late trading.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress,\u201d Netflix (NASDAQ: ) said in a letter to shareholders.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest paid online TV network signed up 6.3 million new users outside the U.S., beating forecasts. Even though domestic subscriptions missed analysts, they at least rebounded from a decline in the previous quarter. Netflix (NASDAQ: ) expects to sign 7 million more international customers during the current three months.\n\nInternational markets account for almost all of Netflix\u2019s growth -- and most of its total customers. Gains in the U.S. last quarter amounted to just 520,000 new accounts. A new season of \u201cLa Casa de Papel,\u201d a Spanish heist series, boosted interest abroad, especially in Latin America and Europe.\n\n\u201cStranger Things,\u201d meanwhile, was viewed by 64 million people in its first four weeks, the most-watched series to date. The teen science-fiction show, now in its third season, is the service\u2019s biggest hit at home.\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ: ) expects to add a total of 7.6 million more customers in the fourth quarter -- fewer than analysts expected. While the final three months of the year are typically among the strongest, the company will face new competition from the Disney+ and Apple (NASDAQ: ) TV+ streaming services.\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ: ) shares rose as high as $318.79 in extended trading. The stock has taken a beating since July, dropping 21% since last quarter\u2019s miss. It closed at $286.28 in regular trading on Wednesday.\n\nU.S. Woes\n\nThird-quarter revenue grew 31% to $5.24 billion, just shy of Wall Street projections. Profit increased to $1.47 a share, easily beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $1.05.\n\nThis quarter, the company forecasts profit of 51 cents a share on revenue of $5.44 billion. Both are below Wall Street estimates.\n\nIn the U.S., there wasn\u2019t much to cheer about. The company is going to post its weakest growth at home in years, adding just 2.7 million customers this year. A recent price increase contributed to the slowdown, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) said.\n\nThe company also is bracing for fresh competition this quarter.\n\n\u201cThe launch of these new services will be noisy,\u201d Netflix (NASDAQ: ) said in its letter. \u201cThere may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long term, though, we expect we\u2019ll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity.\u201d\n\n(Updates with company remarks starting in third paragraph)", "description": "Netflix Rallies After Overseas Growth Eases Investor Worries", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF0H0BE_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
