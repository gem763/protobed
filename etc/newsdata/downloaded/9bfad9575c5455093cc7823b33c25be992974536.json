The battle ahead is a battle for our home and for our homeland.\u201d\n\nHe was addressing a small gathering of media and supporters, including several pro-democracy lawmakers. Supporters chanted \u201cFor our homeland!\u201d and \u201cDemocracy now!\u201d\n\n\u201cHong Kong is a small city of seven million, and it is facing a battle,\u201d lawmaker Fernando Cheung told the gathering. \u201cJoshua Wong is at the front of the battle lines. It is not an easy thing to do at all. He should be renamed as the David of David and Goliath. His strength is insurmountable.\u201d\n\nThe 22-year-old will run for a seat on a district council in the city\u2019s south, where he has lived for over a decade. Although such councils are the lowest level of municipal organization, they can potentially be a fast track to the city\u2019s legislature, because the 431 members of district councils across Hong Kong are entitled to elect one of their number to become a lawmaker.\n\nSpeaking earlier to TIME, Wong said: \u201cThe fight for democracy relies on community support. Realizing how to enhance people\u2019s livelihoods and urban planning is significant.\u201d\n\nRead more: Five Years On, Hong Kong Activist Joshua Wong Speaks to TIME About the Umbrella Revolution\n\nWong\u2019s announcement comes as the semi-autonomous enclave enters its 17th consecutive weekend of protests. The demonstrations were initially a response to a controversial, now withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed the rendition of fugitives to mainland China. But demands have since evolved and the protestors, mostly of them young, are calling for democratic reform and greater autonomy from Beijing, which has sovereignty over the former British colony under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework.\n\nLast month, official figures showed a surge in the number of registered voters in the city, with the most significant increase seen in the 18 to 35 age group. The spike has been linked to the ongoing protests, which have inspired greater political awareness in many young people.\n\nThere is a widespread expectation that the establishment will suffer at the hands of such voters in the coming race. District councils are presently dominated by pro-Beijing parties, but Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, says \u201cThe protests are bound to have a beneficial effect on pro-democracy candidates.\u201d\n\nWong\u2019s announcement marks his first participation in a political race. Members of Demosisto, his political party, have had their attempts to enter local politics thwarted. Nathan Law was elected to the city\u2019s Legislative Council in 2016 but disqualified over the manner in which he took his oath, while Agnes Chow was barred last year from running in a by-election due to the party\u2019s support for self-determination for Hong Kong.\n\nWong acknowledged the possibility that he, too, might be prohibited from running \u2014 even for a district-level council. \u201cIf they disqualify me, I know it will generate more international momentum to keep focusing on Hong Kong,\u201d he told TIME a day ahead of his campaign announcement.\n\nLam warns that in the present political climate, disqualifications of pro-democracy candidates would \u201clikely provoke sizable protest.\u201d\n\nRead more: Will Unrest in Hong Kong Spoil China\u2019s Big Party?\n\nHong Kong is meanwhile bracing for a weekend of demonstrations in the lead up to China\u2019s National Day on Oct. 1, which will mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic.\n\nLater on Saturday, protestors will commemorate the Umbrella Revolution, and on Sunday will take part in an \u201canti-totalitarianism march\u201d to government headquarters. Supporters in several cities around the world are expected to hold protest rallies on the same day.\n\nWong says he will submit his application next week to election officials, who will decide whether or not his candidacy can proceed. The vote will be held in November.\n\n\u201cI have no plan to shift the focus from the protests to the election,\u201d Wong told TIME. \u201cBut I want to generate more momentum to keep the pressure on Beijing, [whether from] inside the [district] council, on the streets or in the international community.\u201d\n\nWrite to Hillary Leung at hillary.leung@time.com.", "description": "Joshua Wong says he will run for local elections in an announcement timed with the fifth anniversary of the Umbrella Revolution.", "authors": ["Hillary Leung", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/joshua-wong-hong-kong-activist.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C10px%2C1024px%2C536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip"}
