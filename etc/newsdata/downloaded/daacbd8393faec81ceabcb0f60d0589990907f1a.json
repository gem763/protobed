Ethiopia rejected that call.\n\nEgypt has sought assurances that the dam will not significantly cut the river's flow to its rapidly growing population.\n\nSudan also hopes to benefit from electricity produced by the GERD.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Nashaat Hamdy; Writing by Yousef Saba)", "description": "Egypt denounced Ethiopia on Wednesday for moving forward with building and operating a hyropower dam on the Nile, which Cairo worries will threaten already scarce water supplies.
