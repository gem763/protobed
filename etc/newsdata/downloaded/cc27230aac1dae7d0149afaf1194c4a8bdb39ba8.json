You know what I mean?\n\n\u2018If they\u2019re talking about me, that\u2019s good enough!\n\n\u2018I know that in some ways I\u2019ve divided opinion, but at least I went in there and I was myself.\n\n\u2018I hope that I\u2019ve given a voice maybe to that disabled child that doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be somebody or their parents that think that their disabled child isn\u2019t going to have a normal life.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
