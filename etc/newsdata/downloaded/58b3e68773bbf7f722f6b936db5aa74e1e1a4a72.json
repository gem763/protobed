The group announced plans to spend $500,000 this year alone.\n\n\"Making sure that people feel their votes matter \u2013 that\u2019s what we hear from people all over the country. Because of the way maps are cracked or packed, people squashed together, many voters are not represented fairly,\" said Virginia Kase, the League's CEO.\n\n\"Maybe people think of us as little old ladies sitting at tables registering voters, but we do so much more than that.\u201d\n\nThe scope and breadth of the campaign -- involving thousands of volunteers across all 50 states -- is unprecedented in the organization's more than 100-year history, Kase said.\n\nThe effort comes as former President Barack Obama and rising Democratic star Stacey Abrams of Georgia, have each also kicked off high-profile initiatives aimed at overhauling how the nation's electoral maps are drawn.\n\nAdvocates' goal is to set the stage for a sweeping state-by-state redistricting effort that will begin in 2021 following conclusion of the 2020 Census. The process, which happens once a decade, determines how voters are represented in state legislatures and Congress, which in turn can affect how billions in state and federal funds are distributed.\n\nLast month, Obama announced \u201cRedistricting U,\u201d an effort to train volunteer grassroots organizers on \u201cthe tools to impact the redistricting process in their state.\u201d Abrams also unveiled a multistate voter protection initiative -- \u201cFair Fight 2020\u201d \u2013 to promote voting rights and fair election policies.\n\nTraining is at the heart of organizing. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve always made it a priority \u2013 from my 2008 campaign until now. And it\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to announce @allontheline\u2019s in-person training initiative, Redistricting U. Join us: https://t.co/yrWJ50wSdE pic.twitter.com/HiKvGd2XyE \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) August 26, 2019\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do through Fair Fight 2020 is we\u2019re going to fight back. But we\u2019re fighting early. We\u2019re doing this now,\u201d she said in an August announcement.\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe campaigns are partly a response to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June decision to stay out of the politics of gerrymandering once and for all. The court\u2019s conservative majority said federal courts would not police the drawing of electoral maps, leaving it to the states and Congress to develop and enforce the rules.\n\n\"Our conclusion does not condone excessive partisan gerrymandering. Nor does our conclusion condemn complaints about districting to echo into a void,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the court's opinion in Rucho v Common Cause. \"Provisions in state statutes and state constitutions can provide standards and guidance for state courts to apply.\"\n\nThe League of Women Voters effort \u2013 dubbed \u201cPeople Powered Fair Maps\u201d \u2013 is to be a nonpartisan campaign active in each of 50 states, the group said. The push will involve mobilizing organizers and advocates to educate the public and lobby state and federal lawmakers, plus pursue possible litigation challenging partisan district boundaries.\n\n\"It\u2019s not a one size fits all approach. We are customizing and tailoring our approaches for each state,\" said Kase, the League's CEO.\n\nAdvocates say state constitutional provisions guaranteeing \u201cfree and fair\u201d elections may be the most fertile ground to rollback discriminatory gerrymandering, since any rulings in state court would likely not be reviewable by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nSarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE\n\nJust this week, a unanimous three-judge panel in North Carolina struck down that state\u2019s legislative district maps saying they were unfairly drawn to benefit Republicans -- in violation of the state constitution.\n\nGerry Broome/AP, FILE\n\nThe \u201cdecision offers a framework for other states to evaluate their own redistricting,\u201d said Stanton Jones, a constitutional lawyer at the firm Arnold & Porter in Washington, D.C. \u201cThere are a number of other state constitutions around the country with free elections clauses similar or identical to the one in North Carolina.\u201d\n\nA challenge to Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional map brought by the League of Women Voters reached a similar conclusion last year, with that state\u2019s Supreme Court finding the gerrymandered districts violated state law.\n\nThe cases show that \u201cstate constitutions can be invoked to protect the people of that state,\u201d said Kathay Feng, national redistricting director at Common Cause.\n\nTwenty-eight states have constitutional clauses guaranteeing \u201cfree\u201d elections and 13 of those guarantee the right to \u201cfree and equal election,\u201d according to the group.\n\nThe League plans to also lead campaigns for ballot initiatives in 22 states that would put directly to voters a slate of redistricting reforms and proposed establishment of independent districting commissions.\n\nKase said the group will also join a coordinated lobbying effort in over 20 states to amend state constitutions to include \u201cfree and equal\u201d election protections and enact legislation to enhance transparency in how district boundaries are drawn.", "description": "After a setback at the Supreme Court earlier this year, advocates for fairer, less-partisan election maps nationwide are stepping up their fight at the state level.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/redistricting-gty-jt-190904_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
