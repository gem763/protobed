Whereas on defense, it takes one guy to make you right.\u201d\n\nEreck Flowers knows he has a long way to go, but with Redskins, he\u2019s enjoying football again\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been any one area to point at when evaluating the lackluster run game. One play it\u2019s a penalty. One play it\u2019s a missed block. Another snap may be a bad read or lack of patience by the runner.\n\nEither way, early-down rushes by Week 1 starter Derrius Guice, who is on injured reserve following surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his knee, and current starter Adrian Peterson have put the offense behind the chains and in a bad position to convert third downs. Of 11 first-down touches for Peterson last week, including two receptions, only three resulted in a gain of four yards or more. Six resulted in no gain or a loss, including two penalties. The other two were two-yard gains. Those early-down issues have contributed to the Redskins ranking 21st in the league in third-down efficiency (31.8 percent).\n\nPeterson acknowledged they\u2019ve been working on the entire operation since before training camp but hopes that \u201cwith time, it comes.\u201d\n\nThe run deficiencies led to tweaks by the coaching staff. Chris Thompson received 28 snaps compared to Peterson\u2019s 18 against the Cowboys, and the offense expanded with screens, short passes and more calls to test the perimeter. Undrafted rookie wide receiver Steven Sims received back-to-back handoffs \u2014 the first on a jet sweep and the second on an inside misdirection play.\n\nGuice and Peterson are considered the team\u2019s top backs, but Thompson has been the most heavily used of the group, in part because the team has been playing from behind.\n\n\u201cObviously, AP is AP and you want to feature him in the run game,\u201d Jordan said of Peterson, \u201cbut off of that you still have guys that can make a difference in the run game either by screening or by giving\u2026 the ball to them in a quick manner out in the flats, swing routes, those kind of routes.\u201d\n\nCoach Jay Gruden added, \u201cKeep the defense off balance a little bit and utilize some of the speed and weapons that we have.\u201d\n\nJon Bostic is the voice of a Redskins defense scrambling for answers\n\nCreativity in the run game is a necessity if the traditional stuff isn\u2019t working. Guice managed just 18 yards on 10 carries in the opener and Peterson finished with 25 yards on 10 attempts last week. Thompson was targeted eight times against the Cowboys and caught five passes for 48 yards.\n\nThe Redskins rank 30th in the league with 37.5 rushing yards per game, and the lack of early-down success frequently puts them in challenging second- and third-down situations.\n\n\u201cThe statistics might not look like we ran the ball or the attempts weren\u2019t there, but I know sometimes you have to,\u201d offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell said. \u201c... You have to use the quick game and the screen game as extensions of your run game. Especially against really good defenses that aren\u2019t going to just give you the first- and second-down runs you maybe wanted going into the game.\u201d\n\nThe most common correction mentioned has been a focus on the fundamentals. For the running backs, that means technique, footwork and vision. For the line, it means getting movement with double teams, getting blockers to the second level of the defense and achieving better timing and chemistry with two new starters on the left side. Once those basics are established, creative play-calling can help loosen up the defense.\n\n\u201cAs players, we\u2019ve got to be able to run the ball well enough for Jay to believe that he can rely on it,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cBecause we might get a six-yard run but then the next two or three may be one or two yards; sometimes as a play caller it gets hard and kind of gets frustrating for him.\u201d\n\nCreative schemes help, but Thompson points back to the individual. The seventh-year veteran thinks penalties and miscues have built on each other \u2014 the team\u2019s 18 penalties over two games are the seventh-most in the NFL \u2014 because it\u2019s human nature for players to try to make up for previous mistakes.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, your focus and the details,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cYou can\u2019t lose track of what your job is and think, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to do more.\u2019 \u2026 You can never get yourself flustered and all aggravated in situations because there\u2019s going to be ups and downs and you just have got to keep yourself focused on the goal, and that\u2019s to win and that\u2019s to be as consistent as you possibly can.\u201d\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nTony Wyllie, Redskins\u2019 head of communications, is leaving the organization\n\nRedskins send Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie to injured reserve, sign Noah Spence\n\nJenkins: Case Keenum is part of the solution, but the Redskins\u2019 problem might be too big", "description": "Washington ranks third-worst in the league in yards per game, and is hoping to improve things starting Monday night versus the Bears.", "authors": ["Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RER7J3GX7EI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
