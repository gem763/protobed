Many had camped out on the streets overnight.\n\nSecurity forces responded by firing live bullets to disperse the crowd near Tahrir.\n\nMeanwhile, Iraqi hospital officials reported nine more deaths in the southern city of Nasiriyah, about 320 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Baghdad, bringing this week\u2019s overall death toll to 42.\n\nHospital officials said the deaths occurred late Thursday. Nasiriyah has witnessed the most violence in the protests, with at least 25 people, including a policeman, killed. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.\n\nSince Tuesday, security forces have fired live rounds and tear gas every day to disperse protesters demanding job opportunities, improved services and an end to corruption.\n\nPrime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi spoke in a televised address to the nation, broadcast at 2:30 a.m., about the demonstrations that have spread across many provinces in the country.\n\nThe rallies have erupted spontaneously, mostly spurred by youths wanting jobs, improved services such as electricity and water, and an end to endemic corruption in the oil-rich country. Authorities have also cut internet access in much of Iraq since late Wednesday, in a desperate move to curb the rallies.\n\n\u201cWe will not make empty promises \u2026 or promise what we cannot achieve,\u201d said Abdul-Mahdi, who hails from Nasiriyah.\n\nHe said there is \u201cno magic solution\u201d to Iraq\u2019s problems but pledged to work on laws granting poor families a basic income, provide alternative housing to violators and fight corruption.\n\n\u201cThe security measures we are taking, including temporary curfew, are difficult choices. But like bitter medicine, they are inevitable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to return life to normal in all provinces and respect the law.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister also defended the nation\u2019s security forces, saying they abide by strict rules against use of \u201cexcessive violence\u201d and that it was the escalation of the protests that leads to violence.\n\nHe also said, without elaborating, that he \u201cregrets some have successfully derailed some of the protests from their peaceful path\u201d in order to \u201cexploit\u201d the violence for political reasons.\n\nThe unrest is the most serious challenge for Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s year-old government, which also has been caught in the middle of increasing U.S.-Iran tensions in the region. Iraq is allied with both countries and hosts thousands of U.S. troops, as well as powerful paramilitary forces allied with Iran.\n\nThe mostly leaderless protests have been concentrated in Baghdad and in predominantly Shiite areas of southern Iraq, bringing out jobless youths and university graduates who are suffering under an economy reeling from graft and mismanagement.\n\nAfter Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s speech, Iraqis awaited what Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the country\u2019s top Shiite cleric, would say about the protests in his Friday sermon.\n\nIn Nasiriyah, protester Haidar Hamid dismissed the prime minister\u2019s speech, saying instead that said he was looking to the Shiite religious authority for a resolution.\n\n\u201cWe wait until Friday prayers,\u201d said Hamid, an unemployed 32-year-old. \u201cIf the government is not dissolved, we will avenge our martyrs.\u201d\n\nA group that monitors internet and cybersecurity, NetBlocks, said the internet was briefly restored before al-Mahdi\u2019s speech but by the time he was on screen access was again shut as new videos emerged of the protests. The internet in Iraq\u2019s northern Kurdish region has not been affected.\n\nOn Thursday, Iraq closed a border crossing with Iran in the eastern province of Diyala, saying it will remain closed until further notice. Protesters who had blocked sections of the road to Baghdad\u2019s International Airport late Thursday had dispersed before daylight.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Iraq's premier on Friday urged anti-government protesters to go home, saying their \"legitimate demands\" have been heard and comparing security measures imposed in the wake of this week's demonstrations to \"bitter medicine\" that needs to be swallowed as the death toll from the violence rose to 42.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Qassim Abdul-Zahra"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/aptopix_iraq_protests_96588_c0-312-4054-2675_s1770x1032.jpg?8ace1d6fb763342f17db2f1c2d3e37d966fca870", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
