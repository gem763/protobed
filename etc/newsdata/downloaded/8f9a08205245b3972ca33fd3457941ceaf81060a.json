(\u201cNexa Resources\u201d or \u201cNexa\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE and TSX Symbol: \u201cNEXA\u201d) hereby informs its shareholders and the market in general the occurrence of an equipment failure at the Vazante mine operation in Minas Gerais, Brazil.\n\nDuring a regular inspection activity, a crack was identified in the trunnion at the discharge side in the primary mill used in the concentration plant. No work accidents nor environmental impacts from this failure were reported. Equipment repair should last about 30 days.\n\nDuring this period, Vazante mine should operate at 30% of its nominal production capacity and as a result, Nexa expects a production loss of 8 to 10 thousand tons of zinc in concentrate. 2019 production guidance is under review to reflect this temporary loss.\n\nNexa will keep its shareholders and the market duly informed in a timely manner of any further developments arising from this equipment failure.\n\nAbout Nexa\n\nNexa is a large-scale, low-cost integrated zinc producer with over 60 years of experience developing and operating mining and smelting assets in Latin America. The Company currently owns and operates five long-life underground mines \u2013 three located in the Central Andes of Peru and two located in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil \u2013 and is among the top five producers of mined zinc globally in 2018, according to Wood Mackenzie. Nexa is also one of the top five metallic zinc producers worldwide in 2018, according to Wood Mackenzie.\n\nCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis News Release contains certain forward-looking information and forward-looking statements as defined in applicable securities laws (collectively referred to in this News Release as \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d).
