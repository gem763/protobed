It used to undergo amortization, or the writing down of goodwill over a number of years.\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets U.S. accounting standards, abolished amortization of goodwill in 2001 because companies wanted to make acquisitions without having to take large, periodic write-downs on their earnings. The International Accounting Standards Board, which sets standards in more than 140 countries, did the same three years later. FASB and IASB now require companies to test goodwill for potential impairment each year.\n\nThe organizations have attempted to set standards with similar principles since abandoning in 2011 a joint effort to make their standards identical.\n\nMost members of FASB want to reintroduce amortization for public companies, Chairman Russell Golden said Wednesday at an event hosted by the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation and CFA Institute.\n\n\u201cIf you like amortization of goodwill, that\u2019s the good news,\u201d Mr. Golden said. \u201cThe bad news is we don\u2019t exactly have an agreement on how to do that at this time.\u201d\n\nThe reintroduction of goodwill amortization would affect companies in different ways, depending on whether the standard setters institute amortization over a set period or use a weighted average life of assets model with no set time period, among other variables.\n\nIASB\u2019s members are largely opposed to reintroducing the amortization of goodwill, saying it could make it harder to verify if an acquisition is working, but they are still considering changes to its goodwill rules. The board decided not to reintroduce amortization in 2017 and instead focus on improving the impairment model, but that has proven difficult.\n\nFASB gave private companies the option to amortize goodwill over a 10-year period in 2014, and offered nonprofits that option in May this year.\n\nIASB Chairman Hans Hoogervorst said he is in the minority on his board in supporting a move to amortize goodwill for international companies. He called amortization of goodwill \u201cugly as sin\u201d but acknowledged it should be a necessary expense and perhaps the best solution to a challenging problem because it\u2019s \u201cnot likely that goodwill will last forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see time and again that goodwill only gets written off when it\u2019s too late,\u201d Mr. Hoogervorst said during a panel at the event.\n\nFASB, which is hosting a public roundtable on goodwill Nov. 15, recently researched the cost-effectiveness of the current goodwill rules for public companies, but the board is considering making larger changes that would affect all companies.\n\nCompanies recently said in letters to FASB that existing rules for goodwill saddled them with unnecessary costs and are too subjective.\n\nWrite to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com", "description": "The heads of two major accounting standard-setters said they hope to streamline rules on goodwill accounting, despite their boards largely disagreeing on the key issue of whether companies should be allowed to amortize the intangible asset.", "authors": ["Mark Maurer"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-118225/social", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
