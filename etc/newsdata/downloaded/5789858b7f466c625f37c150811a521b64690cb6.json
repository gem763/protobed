And they buy hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of merchandise from us, not only military equipment. In military equipment, about $110 billion. It\u2019s millions of jobs. \u201cNow, with that being said, we are sending troops and other things to the Middle East to help Saudi Arabia. But are you ready? Saudi Arabia, at my request, has agreed to pay us for everything we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s a first. But Saudi Arabia \u2013 and other countries, too, now \u2013 but Saudi Arabia has agreed to pay us for everything we\u2019re doing to help them. And we appreciate that.\u201d\n\nFor the record, Trump has been exaggerating \u2013 at times, hilariously \u2013 the scope and scale of arms deals with Riyadh for quite a while. His rhetoric on the subject is literally unbelievable.\n\nBut in this case, that\u2019s not the most interesting part. Did the president mean to say that we\u2019re sending thousands of troops to the Middle East because Saudi Arabia \u201chas agreed to pay us\u201d?\n\nThe Republican made similar comments last month, bragging about the Saudis willingness to \u201cpay cash.\u201d Trump further suggested that he sees a direct connection between the United States\u2019 willingness to use military force in the Middle East and the money foreign countries are prepared to give us.\n\nAs we discussed at the time, from the American president\u2019s perspective, our military isn\u2019t for sale, but it may be for rent.\n\nIf the Kurds had more money, perhaps Trump wouldn\u2019t have abandoned them?", "description": "From Trump's perspective, our military isn't for sale, but it may be for rent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/nadler_ap_break.jpg?itok=DjexMTkD", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
