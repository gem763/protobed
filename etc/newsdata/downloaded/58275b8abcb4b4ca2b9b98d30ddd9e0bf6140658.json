The lowest paid government worker earns $1,030 (R1,030) per month.\n\nWorse is still to come as the exchange rate of 13:1 to the US$ used for the latest increase is from when the fuel was procured. The exchange rate has since weakened to 15.26:1 and the impact will be felt in the next few weeks.\n\nThe fuel price increase follows hot in the heels of Friday's massive electricity tariff hike of more than 300%\n\nThose who were using low power of about 200 kWh per month will be paying $157 (Zimbabwean dollars) from $38,61 a 306% increase.\n\nThis increase came as a result of an application which the power utility ZETDC issued seeking adjustments of electricity tariffs as the previous charges were no longer sustainable.\n\nIn a statement ZETDC said the increase was inevitable because the previous charges had been eroded following the tumbling local currency.\n\n\"The current tariff 38,61c/kWh had been severely eroded due to the movement of macroeconomic fundamentals,\" it said in a statement.", "description": "According to a notice published by energy regulator Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (ZERA) on Saturday, prices for diesel and petrol are up by 26% and 27% to $15.64 and $14.97, respectively.", "authors": ["Crecey Kuyedzwa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8131/cd2710b18ac947c2b677b4f110b9177e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
