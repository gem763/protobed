His office would, however, not confirm the report when contacted by AFP.\n\nThe PKK has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984 during which tens of thousands of people have been killed.\n\nThe German foreign ministry meanwhile would only say that it was \"aware of the cases\" and that the embassy in Ankara was providing consular assistance.\n\nThe German interior ministry denied claims that information leading to the detention of the five was handed over to Turkish authorities during Interior Minister Horst Seehofer's visit to Ankara this week.\n\nHowever, a ministry spokesman would not rule out that such information could have been exchanged \"as part of the routine cooperation between our security services\".\n\nTurkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu in March this year threatened to detain individuals who came to Turkey if they were involved with the PKK and other groups.\n\n\"We have now taken measures against those who take part in the terror organisation's meetings in Europe, Germany and then come to Antalya, Bodrum, Mugla for a holiday.\n\n\"Let them enter the airports. They will be detained,\" he said.\n\nburs-raz/jh", "description": "Turkish authorities have detained five Germans over alleged links to Kurdish militants, pro-Kurdish media reported.
