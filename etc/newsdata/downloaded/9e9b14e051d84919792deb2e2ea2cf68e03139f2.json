Both defendants faced as much as 15 years. They were convicted last August at trial of attempted gang assault, attempted assault and riot stemming from the Oct. 12, 2018, melee.\n\nPROTEST OUTSIDE TRUMP RALLY IN MINNEAPOLIS 'SICKENS MY STOMACH,' GOP SENATOR SAYS\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame when some people jump up and down on a platform,\u201d Dwyer said in an apparent reference to McInnes, \u201cand their followers, their soldiers, get into trouble.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure the most moral responsibility belongs to these two defendants.\u201d\n\nBoth Kinsman and Hare apologized for their conduct during the Manhattan Supreme Court sentencing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the whole mess. I regret the entire incident,\u201d said Kinsman, who is married with three children. \u201cI made a mistake.\u201d\n\nIn a similar statement, Hare told the judge, \u201cI made a mistake that night. I made quick decisions. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nThey both testified at trial that they acted in self-defense. Assistant DA Joshua Steinglass argued for five-year prison terms.\n\n\u201cThis was not a schoolyard brawl,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cThese are adults who should know better.\u201d\n\nThe fight unfolded shortly after McInnes\u2019 speech ended and the Proud Boys exited the venue, as 60 protesters, including members of Antifa, massed behind barricades and jeered at them. To avoid a confrontation, cops directed the Proud Boys west on 83rd Street, then south on Park Avenue, while they shepherded their opponents in the other direction.\n\nAs the Proud Boys neared East 82nd Street, they saw six suspected Antifa protesters, clad in black, heading toward them. Instead of walking away, the defendants and their pals sprinted more than 100 feet toward their foes, instigating the fight, Steinglass said.\n\nDuring the violent confrontation, Kinsman and Hare repeatedly punched, kicked and stomped on the outnumbered and undersize Antifa members. The victims in the case were never identified, and Antifa refused to cooperate with the investigation. Prosecutors said that if they could have located the Antifa members, they would have also been charged. A total of 10 Proud Boys were charged in connection with the incident. Seven of them took plea deals, and one is still awaiting trial.\n\n\u201cI know enough about history to know what happened in Europe in the \u201930s when political street brawls were allowed to go ahead,\u201d Dwyer said during the sentencing. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that to happen in New York.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally published in the New York Post.", "description": "A Manhattan judge Tuesday sentenced two members of the right-wing Proud Boys group to four years in prison for pummeling leftist Antifa members during a brawl on the Upper East Side.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19295724257030.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
