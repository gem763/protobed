The results illustrate that lost wages and settlement bonuses vary considerably.\n\nFor example, UAW workers will receive signing bonuses of $4,500 or $11,000, with 6 weeks of wage losses ranging between $5,280 and over $9,000. For all categories of workers:\n\n\n\nEmployee Type Six Week Wage Losses Tentative Signing Bonus Temp Worker $5,280 $4,500 In Progression $6,240 $11,000 Legacy (pre-2007) $8,064 $11,000 Skilled Trade $9,240 $11,000 Supplier Worker $4,032 $0\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Sources: AEG analysis of 2015 UAW-GM Agreement and 2019 TA; UAW, GM statements;\n\nExcludes strike pay, substitute work, and unemployment benefits.\n\nRepresentative supplier lost wages presumes loss of 60% of wages during strike.\n\nMeanwhile, the tentative contract\u2019s immediate impact on General Motors would be significant. Anderson Economic Group\u2019s Principal and CEO, Patrick L. Anderson, describes the payouts as substantial, with the automaker likely shouldering ratification bonus costs in excess of $485 million as follows:\n\nEligible Worker\n\nBonus Payments Number of GM UAW Workers 42,780 Number of GM UAW Temp Workers 3,220 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Total Bonus Payments $485.10 million\n\nmemo:\n\nBonus Payments to Michigan Residents $237.7 million Bonus Costs to Michigan-Resident Shareholders $58.2 million\n\nAnderson notes that, as shown in the table above, \u201cMichigan residents are in line to receive nearly half of these bonus monies, with a sum approaching $238 million.\u201d He further indicates that GM shareholders will bear much of the cost of these payouts, including Michigan-resident shareholders, who will absorb a cost of approximately $58M.\n\nAbout the Estimates\n\nLost wages do not include strike pay, substitute work by furloughed employees, or lost earnings at dealerships. The above analysis represents conservative estimates using the consistent and documented methodology AEG has used throughout the UAW-GM strike. Bonus payouts are estimated based upon technical eligibility criteria, but actual results may vary.\n\nPrevious Release: October 23\n\nEast Lansing, MI, October 23, 2019\u2014The UAW GM strike is in the midst of its sixth week as UAW members vote on a tentative agreement reached by negotiators last week.\n\nAnderson Economic Group (AEG) continues to derive ongoing strike impact calculations using a consistent, documented, conservative methodology. Our updated analysis includes the following direct impacts, inclusive of data through October 27 (the end of week six):\n\n$1.75 billion in operating losses for GM,\n\nin operating losses for GM, Direct wage losses for UAW GM workers and supplier workers of $989 million , and\n\n, and $485 million in potential settlement payments to UAW workers (after ratification).\n\nThese numbers do not include strike pay, substitute work by furloughed employees, or lost earnings at dealerships. Similarly, GM losses (and lost wages) due to the strike do not include proposed settlement bonuses to be paid after ratification.\n\n*$989 million in direct wage losses includes $533 million in supplier losses and $456 million lost for UAW workers.\n\nPrevious Release: October 16\n\nAnderson Economic Group Analysis for UAW/GM Strike Week Number 5:\n\nLost Wages Exceed $835 million as GM Lost Profits Top $1.5B\n\nEast Lansing, MI, October 16, 2019\u2014The UAW GM strike rolls on through week five with mounting impacts upon GM, striking workers, state and local governments, and the employees and businesses that rely upon GM\u2019s operations for their livelihood. Analysts at Anderson Economic Group (AEG) today released the following updated impact estimates that include data through October 20:\n\n$1.5 billion in lost profits for GM,\n\nin lost profits for GM, Direct wage losses for all employees in excess of $835 million ,\n\n, $313 million in lost federal income and payroll tax revenue on wages alone, and\n\nin lost federal income and payroll tax revenue on wages alone, and $18.5 million in lost Michigan income tax revenue on wages alone.\n\nThe calculations above do not take into account strike pay, substitute work by furloughed employees, lost earnings at dealerships, or reductions in government expenditures. They were derived using a consistent, documented, conservative methodology.\n\nIn the shadow of such losses, AEG\u2019s CEO and Principal Patrick Anderson yesterday appealed to members of Michigan\u2019s congressional delegation to consider the possibility that elements of the Taft-Hartley Act may need to be invoked in coming days. In the letter sent to Representatives Upton and Dingell, Mr. Anderson notes that the costs for this strike far surpass those associated with the events that precipitated the Act\u2019s last use during the West Coast\u2019s 2002 port shutdown, and concludes:\n\nThe Taft-Hartley Act was intended to apply only when a strike or work stoppage would \u2018imperil the national health or safety,\u2019 and it appropriately sets a high bar for such extraordinary intervention into the bargaining of private parties. Given this high bar, I am writing to ask you to consider whether an appeal to the President may be warranted in the next several days.\n\nThe following pages include charts demonstrating the extent of the economic damage suffered as a result of the ongoing strike.\n\nCharted calculations follow:\n\nFor print quality versions of these images, please contact Lisa Booth, lwbooth (at) AndersonEconomicGroup.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlder Press Clips", "description": "GM/UAW strike: Ongoing economic impact analysis from Anderson Economic Group", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.andersoneconomicgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/GM_UAW.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
