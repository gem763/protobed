Bypassed Its West Coast Team as a Feud With California Escalated", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cIf this were an actually serious policy concern about a state\u2019s performance,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s inconceivable that this wouldn\u2019t be a subject of discussion for months, if not years, between the region and state.\u201d\n\nIn fact, according to the latest review of California\u2019s performance under the Clean Water Act, the state\u2019s rate of \u201csignificant noncompliance\u201d was below the national average. It also had more stringent pollution limits and tougher monitoring than many other states.\n\nCalifornia, the country\u2019s most populous state, does face numerous environmental compliance problems, but E.P.A. officials said many other states have violations at least as serious. California is generally acknowledged to be one of the states that works hardest to resolve its environmental problems.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is the place that has innovated more than anywhere else on air pollution and other regulations,\u201d said William K. Reilly, who served as administrator of the E.P.A. under the first President George Bush . \u201cEverybody knows that.\u201d\n\nMr. Stoker, who is based in Los Angeles, did not attend the all-hands meeting on the day Mr. Wheeler delivered his letter. Instead, it was led by the office\u2019s regional counsel, Sylvia Quast. Other top agency officials, including the director s of the offices of compliance and water, also attended. The regional office has since held at least one other meeting to discuss Mr. Wheeler\u2019s accusations.\n\nThe message from the E.P.A.\u2019s leadership in California has been consistent: Mr. Wheeler\u2019s office bypassed the people who know the most about the state and work most closely with state and local officials. The office has been rerouting requests for the data that supports Mr. Wheeler\u2019s accusations to Washington because the San Francisco office does not have it. They have also advised staff members concerned that the letters have undermined the E.P.A.\u2019s working relationship with the state to tell their counterparts at California agencies that the letter is purely political and that the regional office had nothing to do with it.\n\nOn Tuesday, two senior E.P.A. officials acknowledged that the concerns expressed in the letter did not originate from the regional office. They also asserted that questions over process and turf should not overshadow genuine problems with California\u2019s air and water quality.", "description": "Staff members in the regional office said they had no advance knowledge of a wide-ranging agency complaint against the state and described the process as highly unusual.", "authors": ["Lisa Friedman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/climate/15CLI-CALIFORNIA1/15CLI-CALIFORNIA1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
