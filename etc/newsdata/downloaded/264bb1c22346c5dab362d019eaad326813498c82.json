Bruce buys time with big three points\n\nThis time last week, Bruce was in a dark place. The 5-0 defeat at the King Power Stadium was not only a pitiful result but a pitiful performance, one which meant that any sort of reverse here would make for an uncomfortable international break and an uncertain autumn, with supporters sure to make their discontent known.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Powered by the direct play of Allan Saint-Maximin and the industry of the two Longstaffs, Newcastle were deserving winners. The three points lifts them out of the relegation zone, within just one of their opponents. This will not \u2013 and should not \u2013 placate angry fans, but that makes the victory no less welcome.\n\n3. The other Longstaff punishes Solskjaer\n\nUnited wanted to sign one Longstaff during the summer, before being put off by Newcastle\u2019s \u00a350m valuation. Perhaps they should have asked about the other. Matty, the younger brother of Sean, made his Premier League debut alongside his sibling after catching the eye in pre-season, but few expected it to be a match-winning display.\n\nEven before the decisive goal, both Longstaffs kept United\u2019s midfield in check, pressing and harrying their opponents. Sean was particularly tidy with the ball, but this win will be remembered for his 19-year-old brother, who was given far too much space on the edge of United\u2019s penalty area and invited to slot past De Gea\n\n4. United\u2019s lack of depth disturbing\n\nIt was difficult to think of a weaker United line-up in the Premier League era that was not sent out in an end-of-season dead rubber. Solskjaer could do little about injuries to the likes of Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial and Luke Shaw, but the reason the squad is shallow is because of a failure to recruit properly in the summer.\n\nThis calendar year, Romelu Lukaku, Alexis Sanchez, Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini have all left without being replaced. United could have brought in new bodies without abandoning the admirable commitment to youth development that Solskjaer has shown. Instead, their recruitment strategy is being questioned again.\n\n5. Set-pieces required to provide attacking edge\n\nFor a team struggling to score goals and create chances, there is one obvious area in which Solskjaer\u2019s side could improve. United\u2019s last set-piece goal came against Romelu Lukaku against Crystal Palace back in February, some 220 days ago. That run should have ended just before half time, yet Harry Maguire sent a free header wide.\n\nSet-pieces are an edge that almost every team can improve on. Few managers exploit them properly. Those that do benefit greatly. Given how uninspiring United\u2019s attacking is in open play, it may be wise for Solskjaer and his staff to spend some time on dead-ball situations over the coming international break.", "description": "1.
