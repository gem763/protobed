Lehtikuva/Heikki Saukkomaa via REUTERS\n\nThe EU executive of Jean-Claude Juncker is due to end its five-year term on Oct 31, the same day that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had promised his country would be leaving the bloc.\n\nBritain\u2019s departure date now seems almost certain to be put back, while a postponement of one month to the start of the new Commission is almost certain because it is still missing commissioners from France, Hungary and Romania. Under EU law, each of the EU\u2019s 28 countries including Britain must have one commissioner.\n\nBritain did not propose a candidate for commissioner when the other 27 EU countries did because Johnson was adamant his country would no longer be a member of the EU in November.\n\nHe was then forced by his own parliament to ask for a delay to Brexit until Jan. 31, throwing back open the question of Britain proposing a member of the EU executive.\n\n\u201cIf after the 1st of November - and there are still steps to take, so that is not a given - there might be an extension and the UK will still be in the EU, then of course I would ask the UK to send a Commissioner,\u201d von der Leyen told reporters on a visit to Finland.\n\nShe said the EU had to consider whether to grant Britain an extension, a discussion she said \u201clooks really good\u201d, and if so for how long.\n\nAnte Rinne, prime minister of Finland which now holds the rotating presidency of the bloc, said \u201cmaybe all\u201d EU countries backed an extension for London.\n\nAWAITING CANDIDATES\n\nVon der Leyen said she would soon invite the French candidate for commissioner, Thierry Breton, for an interview to discuss the EU\u2019s single market and digital agenda \u2014 a portfolio he would likely be given if he passes a hearing in the European Parliament.\n\nShe said she hoped Romania would pick a Commission candidate \u201cwithin the next days\u201d but added that she did not specifically request the Romanian candidate be a woman.\n\nThe issue of the Commission\u2019s gender balance has been high on von der Leyen\u2019s agenda.\n\nBut her goal of an equal number of men and women there was scuppered by the European Parliament when it rejected France\u2019s first candidate, Sylvie Goulard, after grilling her over a jobs scandal and her previous work for a think-tank.", "description": "Britain will have to propose a candidate for a commissioner in the next European Commission if it is still a member of the European Union after Oct. 31, incoming Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444461050&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0T2", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
