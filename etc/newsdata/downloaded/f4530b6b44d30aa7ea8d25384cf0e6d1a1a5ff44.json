NO! Must testify to explain why he got my Ukraine conversation sooo wrong,\" Trump tweeted.\n\n\"Did Schiff tell him to do that? We must determine the Whistleblower's identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly characterises his Zelensky call as \"perfect,\" but the whistleblower's complaint noted how some White House officials were so concerned about Trump's actions on the call that they sought to severely restrict access to its record.\n\nThe White House memo of the call shows Trump sought a \"favor\" from Zelensky. Democrats say it was a demand to investigate Joe Biden - the president's potential 2020 election rival - and a Ukrainian firm that hired Biden's son Hunter.\n\nHouse Democrat Jamie Raskin said he believes Hill could shed light on what he described as \"a very powerful shadow foreign policy being operated out of Ukraine by the president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani\" that bypassed normal channels in order to apply coercive pressure on Kiev.\n\n\"I think that she would have a comprehensive overview of that whole situation,\" Raskin told MSNBC.", "description": "Donald Trump has demanded that a whistleblower whose warning about the US president's call with Ukraine triggered the impeachment inquiry against him be identified and testify before Congress.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9467/ea54f2bbee9e4dd4bb5850487ea4611a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
