Now that Speaker Pelosi has finally come around to green-light the inquiry, the race is on to set the political narrative. Polling has shown lopsided opposition to impeachment thus far, but it's unclear if and how the new facts will impact public opinion. As that battle rages, some Democrats and figures on the Left don't seem to be on board. For instance, 2020 presidential hopeful Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- who just qualified for the next Democratic debate, having missed the last one -- is sounding very skeptical of the exercise:\n\nTulsi Gabbard, a House member and 2020 candidate, holds the line against impeachment on Fox this a.m.: \"I've been consistent in saying...Impeachment...would be terribly divisive for the country at a time when we are already extremely divided.\"https://t.co/60IdIqbsI1 \u2014 Alex Seitz-Wald (@aseitzwald) September 24, 2019\n\nThe Hawaii representative said impeachment would intensify \"hyperpartisanship\" that is \"driving our country apart...\"I think it's important to beat Donald Trump, that's why I'm running for president,\" she said. \"But I think it's the American people who need to make their voices heard making that decision.\"\n\nMinnesota moderate Collin Peterson, a Democrat who is clinging on in a district Trump carried handily in 2016, thinks an impeachment process will be divisive and futile:\n\nCollin Peterson on impeachment: \"Without significant bipartisan support, impeachment proceedings will be a lengthy and divisive action with no resolution. I believe it will be a failed process that will end up even further dividing our country\" ...

Elsewhere, a House Democratic freshman who has just recently come around on impeachment is already venting frustration that there doesn't appear to be a coherent plan or path forward from her party's leadership:\n\nNot all Democrats are happy with the current strategy. Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), one of seven vulnerable freshman Democrats who backed impeachment hearings in an op-ed Monday night, blasted the game plan in the caucus meeting. \u201cWe came out [for an inquiry] because this is something different. This meeting did not give me confidence that this will be something different,\u201d Slotkin said, according to sources in the room. \u201cIf you are asking us to stay on message, give us a goddamn message to stay on.\u201d\n\nI've laid out my thoughts and impressions on this new impeachment adventure, yet I can't help but chuckle at this:\n\nHouse Democrats big challenge is ensuring the impeachment inquiry doesn't sound political https://t.co/9gZtq1G1Iz pic.twitter.com/RWcHRZ9XIZ \u2014 Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) September 24, 2019\n\n\n\nAfter the Democrat-media alliance's hair-on-fire reaction to all things Trump for two-plus years, with everything reflexively portrayed as outrageous crises and threats to the republic (including the endlessly-hyped and overblown Russia saga)?
