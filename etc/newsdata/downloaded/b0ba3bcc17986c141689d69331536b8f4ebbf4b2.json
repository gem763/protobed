Either it is turned on for everyone, or broken for everyone.\u201d\n\nThe National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council said quick access to online communications was particularly \u201cvital\u201d in child sex abuse cases.\n\n\u201cTechnological advances have given criminals easy ways to target and groom children,\u201d said chief constable Simon Bailey, the lead for child protection.\n\n\u201cThis evidence can help us secure prosecutions but more importantly, find victims and end their exploitation.\u201d\n\nThe UK-US Bilateral Data Access Agreement was signed with US attorney general William Barr in Washington, where the home secretary met security partners.\n\nThe US will have reciprocal access to data from UK communication service providers, and the British government said it had obtained assurances meaning that the death penalty would not be used against any criminals convicted as a result.\n\nMr Barr said: \u201cOnly by addressing the problem of timely access to electronic evidence of a crime committed in one country that is stored in another, can we hope to keep pace with twenty-first-century threats.\n\n\u201cThis agreement will make the citizens of both countries safer, while at the same time assuring robust protections for privacy and civil liberties.\u201d\n\nOfficials said data requests for the US must be \u201cproportionate\u201d and made in accordance with British laws including the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act.\n\n\u201cAny request for data will be subject to independent oversight or review by a court, judge, magistrate or other independent authority,\u201d a Home Office spokesperson said. \u201cThe agreement does not change anything about the way companies can use encryption and does not stop companies from encrypting data.\u201d\n\nIt gives effect to the Crime (Overseas Production Orders) Act 2019 and the American Cloud Act, which allows similar agreements to be made with other nations with required privacy and legal protections.\n\nTechnology firms have previously said they want to help law enforcement agencies, but were constrained by American privacy and data laws.\n\nSeparately, Ms Patel, Mr Barr, the acting US homeland security secretary and Australia\u2019s ministers for home affairs wrote an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg opposing plans to encrypt messaging services.\n\nIt calls for a halt to the proposals unless the company can provide assurances that law enforcement will be able to \u201caccess content in exceptional circumstances in order to protect the public\u201d.\n\nThe politicians argued that although many communication platforms, including WhatsApp, are already encrypted, Facebook\u2019s plans would have a significant impact on efforts to tackle paedophiles and terrorists.\n\n\u201cTech companies like Facebook have a responsibility to balance privacy with the safety of the public,\u201d Ms Patel said. \u201cSo far nothing we have seen from Facebook reassures me that their plans for end-to-end encryption will not act as a barrier to the identification and pursuit of criminals operating on their platforms.\u201d\n\nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) estimates that child sex abuse referrals from Facebook have led to more than 2,500 arrests in 2018 and almost 3,000 children safeguarded.\n\nRob Jones, its director of threat leadership, said the current end-to-end encryption proposals \u201ccould place key information about what their users say and do out of the reach of law enforcement investigations\u201d.\n\nThe NSPCC said Facebook\u2019s plans would send efforts to combat child abuse \u201cback to the digital dark ages\u201d.\n\nThe charity\u2019s head of child safety online, Tony Stower, said: \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute scandal that Facebook are actively choosing to provide offenders with a way to hide in the shadows on their platform, seamlessly able to target, groom and abuse children completely undetected.\u201d\n\nFacebook has not yet responded to The Independent\u2018s request for comment.", "description": "British police and intelligence agencies will be able to demand suspects\u2019 social media data directly from American technology giants under a new agreement signed with the US government.
