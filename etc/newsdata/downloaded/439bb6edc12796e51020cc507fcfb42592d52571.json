(Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission) More\n\nThe FWC launched the investigation in February 2018 after receiving a tip from the public. Investigators determine that a \"ring of well-organized wildlife traffickers\" was catching and selling the turtles to large-scale reptile dealers and illegal distributors, who would then ship most of them overseas on the black market, according to the release.\n\n(MORE: 104 pieces of plastic found in baby sea turtle that washed ashore in Florida)\n\nOne of the suspects, 39-year-old Fort Myers resident Michael Boesenberg, allegedly directed others to collect the turtles in \"large numbers.\" Once they \"had enough,\" they would then sell them to a buyer with links to Asian markets, FWC officials said.\n\nThe turtles were sold wholesale for up to $300 each and retailed for as much as $10,000 in Asia. In one month alone, an estimated $60,000 worth of turtles were trafficked out of Florida, according to the FWC\n\nWhile the turtles were mostly sold for cash, the poachers would occasionally trade them for marijuana products, officials said.\n\nThe poachers would target habitats known for specific species of turtles and \"depleted the species so much\" that they had to expand to other parts of the state, according to the FWC. Lee County, the primary location of the poachings, was the most heavily impacted, but the affect on the wild turtle population overall stretched beyond the state.\n\n(MORE: Salmonella outbreak linked to pet turtles affecting people in 13 states: CDC)\n\n\"Wild turtle populations cannot sustain the level of harvest that took place here,\" said Dr. Brooke Talley, the Reptile and Amphibian Conservation Coordinator for the FWC. \"This will likely have consequences for the entire ecosystem and is a detriment for our citizens and future generations.\"\n\nPHOTO: Wildlife officials in Florida returned turtles to the wild after busting a trafficking ring of thousands of the smuggled reptiles.
