The Hezbollah strike, which targeted an Israeli military vehicle, fulfilled that threat, Hezbollah\u2019s Al-Manar TV station said.\n\nThe encounter was intense but limited, and abated after about an hour. Neither side reported casualties, and there were no immediate indications that a further escalation was imminent. After Israel announced that it had stopped firing on Lebanon, there was relief that the widely predicted confrontation appeared to have been contained.\n\nThe exchange nonetheless showed the risk that long-running tensions between Israel and Iran, Hezbollah\u2019s chief sponsor, could erupt into all-out war. It was the first exchange of fire across the tense Lebanese-Israeli border since Hezbollah and Israel fought a month-long war in 2006, and it threatened the fragile cease-fire that has held since then.\n\n[U.S. voices support for Israel as war fears rise in the Middle East]\n\nAt stake is a wider competition being waged mostly in the shadows in which Iran is seeking to supply its ally Hezbollah with precision missiles capable of striking Israel and Israel is seeking to prevent it from doing so. In recent weeks, Israel has struck targets in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon in an attempt to prevent sophisticated weapons or parts that could be used for making them from reaching its borders.\n\n\n\n\u201cI tell the Israeli army on the border \u2014 be prepared and wait for us,\u201d Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah\u2019s leader, said last Sunday in the aftermath of an apparent Israeli drone strike on a Hezbollah office in the southern suburbs of Beirut. (Al-Manar TV/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nSunday\u2019s encounter suggested both sides want to be seen as holding their ground while avoiding a larger conflict.\n\nHezbollah said two of its brigades had launched missiles against a tank and caused deaths and injuries among Israelis. Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said the target was an unmarked military ambulance and there were no casualties.\n\nThe discrepancy in the accounts might be explained by claims in Israeli media Sunday night that Israel used decoy dummies splattered in red paint to convince Hezbollah that its strike had killed or injured Israelis. The claim, originally reported by public broadcaster Kan TV, was accompanied by footage showing the apparently injured Israelis on stretchers arriving at a hospital. Conricus declined to comment.\n\nConricus said Israel retaliated by firing about 100 shells into the area of southern Lebanon from which the attack was launched, in the vicinity of the town of Maroun al-Ras. Video footage from the area showed plumes of smoke rising from the mountainous countryside, suggesting most of the shells had landed in empty land.\n\nThe confrontation appeared to be over, Conricus said, but he said Israel would be on guard against any further Hezbollah retaliation in the coming days.\n\n\u201cThe strategic situation is still ongoing,\u201d he said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces a contentious round of elections Sept. 17, appeared to taunt Hezbollah, boasting that the strike did not achieve its desired effect.\n\n\u201cWe have no casualties, no injuries, not even a scratch,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHezbollah, however, hailed the strike on Israel as making good on the threat to retaliate by its leader, Hasan Nasrallah. Jubilant supporters took to the streets of Beirut\u2019s Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs in celebration, waving photographs of the two Hezbollah fighters whose deaths were avenged.\n\n[Attacks blamed on Israel across three Middle East countries ratchet up tensions]\n\nNasrallah has threatened to retaliate separately for a drone attack on its stronghold in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs the previous weekend in which an exploding drone detonated and a second one crashed. Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the attack, which Israel has not denied.\n\nHezbollah will respond to that incident by shooting down an Israeli drone, Nasrallah said.\n\nIn a speech Saturday night, however, Nasrallah indicated that Hezbollah is in no hurry to take revenge for the drone attack, which came hours after the Israeli strike on Syria. He said Hezbollah had no intention of downing all the Israeli drones that almost constantly overfly Lebanon because to do so would \u201cerode the defenses of the resistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe choose the time, we choose the place, we choose the circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they should know this is a new phase and their unmanned planes are subject to being taken down.\u201d\n\nLebanese politicians appealed for restraint and de-escalation. Prime Minister Saad Hariri called U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and an aide to French President Emmanuel Macron requesting their intervention to stave off further violence.\n\nThe United Nations, whose peacekeepers police the cease-fire in southern Lebanon, expressed concern that the flare-up risked unraveling a 13-year truce. However, the U.N. force said in a statement, \u201cat this time calm has returned in the area.\u201d\n\nSly reported from Beirut.
