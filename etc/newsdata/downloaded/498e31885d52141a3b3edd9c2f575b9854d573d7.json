Palladium, meanwhile, which has benefited from gasoline engines winning market share back from diesels, has nearly doubled in the last 14 months.\n\nPrices for precious metals continue to be underpinned by the expectation of further interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve which would reduce the yield premium for bonds over bullion. According to Investing.com\u2019s , investors see a 94% chance of the Fed cutting rates for the third time this year next week, with a 28% chance of a further cut in December.\n\nING analysts say such expectations are perfectly consistent with the slowing economy, where manufacturing weakness has recently started to spill over into consumption.\n\n\u201cAssuming the economy continues to soften in line with our view \u2013 we expect sub-2% 3Q19 GDP growth and sub-1.5% growth in 4Q \u2013 then the Fed will likely follow up with additional rate cuts in December and January,\u201d said James Knightley, chief international economist with ING, in a research note earlier this week.", "description": "Gold Prices Tick up But Get Little Support From Weak Earnings", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED1M0ED_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
