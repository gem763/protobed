So the car is five metres long, it's within the cars length even,\" he said.\n\n\"As long as there's a human being involved, 4G is fine. It's really if you want to go down to use automated driving without any driver that you will need 5G.\"\n\nEriksson pointed to mines as an area where autonomous driving would first be deployed.\n\n\"5G will give you more capacity for all these cameras and things, for the latency and drivers, you don't really need it,\" he said.\n\nThe technology used in the trial would unlikely be retrofitted to existing vehicles, the CTO said, so the technology could take up to a decade to appear in vehicles as the entire Australian fleet is replaced.\n\nDisclosure: Chris Duckett travelled to Telstra Vantage as a guest of Telstra.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nDigital un-transformation: Commonwealth backs Victoria's school phone ban\n\nMinister for Education Dan Tehan said it would be 'wonderful' if other states and territories followed Victoria's announcement to ban mobile phone use during school hours.\n\nPublic Transport Victoria in breach of Privacy Act after re-identifiable data on over 15m myki cards released\n\nPublic Transport Victoria found in breach of Privacy and Data Protection Act after a dataset containing a record of 1.8 billion myki events was provided without sufficient de-identification.\n\nVictoria Police get dedicated Drone Unit\n\nPolice will use the 50 unmanned aerial drones to support operations, map crime scenes, and provide search and rescue support.\n\nAudit rules Victoria's public health system as 'highly vulnerable' to cyber attacks\n\nThe Victorian Auditor-General's Office finds health system could suffer the same fate as the UK's National Health Service and Singapore's SingHealth.", "description": "Lidar system to be used to monitor intersection to provide warnings to connected vehicles.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/13/dafed46f-f319-45e6-b0a7-f32f4fddddfd/thumbnail/770x578/c25f1147b5959fc805e4203c0c6cd991/telstra-lexus-connected-car.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
