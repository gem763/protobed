If you prefer breast meat over thigh, feel free to swap it in.\n\nFeatured in: Grab Your Picnic Baskets: The Party\u2019s Moving Outside.\n\nLearn: How to Make Fried Chicken", "description": "This recipe for chicken biscuits could be a weeknight dinner with a side of greens, but it's made to travel, and perfectly suited for a picnic The biscuit dough, adapted from Sam Sifton's all-purpose biscuit recipe, is lightly kneaded here, so it's not too tender to work in a sandwich The chicken tenders, inspired by Masaharu Morimoto's katsu in the cookbook \"Mastering the Art of Japanese Home Cooking,\" are pounded and coated in panko for plenty of crunch", "authors": ["Tejal Rao", "The New York Times", "William Grimes", "Melissa Clark", "Mark Bittman", "Amanda Hesser", "Sarah Digregorio", "Sam Sifton", "Julia Moskin", "Samin Nosrat"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/28/dining/28PICNIC7/28PICNIC7-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2017-06-28"}
