It's Up to the Senate", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 With chances rapidly increasing that President Donald Trump will be impeached by the House and tried in the Senate, an intriguing question has reared its head: Could he be ousted only to try to return to the White House in 2020 in a Trumpian bid for redemption and revenge?\n\nLike so much of the coming impeachment showdown, that decision rests entirely with the Senate. The Constitution famously grants senators the sole power to convict and remove a president \u2014 something that has never been done. What is seldom discussed is a more obscure clause of the Constitution that allows the Senate discretion to take a second, even more punitive step, to disqualify the person it convicts from holding \u201cany office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.\u201d\n\nImposing that penalty would effectively bar the president from reclaiming his old job. In an added twist, tacking on the extra punishment requires only a majority vote in the Senate, not the two-thirds \u2014 or 67 senators \u2014 required to convict.\n\nFor now, the idea of disqualifying Trump is the remotest of hypotheticals, since it would first require the Senate to vote to impeach and remove him. That seems far-fetched, given how little appetite Republicans in the chamber have shown so far for deserting him, despite the flood of damaging revelations that have come forth in the impeachment inquiry. But if nearly two dozen Republicans did vote to impeach him, it would take only a simple majority to banish him from the presidency for life.\n\nThe little-known constitutional quirk \u2014 which has been applied unevenly in the cases of federal judges removed from office \u2014 is only one example of what can happen in the freewheeling process of a presidential impeachment, an exceedingly rare and constantly evolving proceeding that is replete with untested precedents.\n\nThe likelihood of an impeachment trial has senators and aides reading up on the process, with a lot to digest. Uncertainty is rife. Could the Senate censure Trump as an alternative to ousting him, a proposal that was defeated on procedural grounds during the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton? Is a motion to dismiss the articles of impeachment in order \u2014 and if so, when?\n\nThen there are much larger questions. Could new revelations about Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to smear his political rivals shake Republicans from strongly backing him? How would Congress impose its will on the president, and would he comply? Would the courts intervene, and what would they have to say?\n\nSome constitutional scholars wonder whether the disqualification clause even applies to a president, but the consensus is that it was written precisely for that purpose when the authors of the Constitution gathered in Philadelphia in 1787.\n\n\u201cIf we know anything about what the framers were particularly thinking of when they were drafting the impeachment clauses, it was that they had the president clearly in mind,\u201d said Frank Bowman, a constitutional law professor at the University of Missouri and author of \u201cHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump.\u201d\n\nNow 73, Trump might not even be interested in running again if he were ousted by a Senate dominated by members of his own party. But for a president who is always spoiling for a fight, it might be sweet payback to be reelected by voters after Democratic and Republican lawmakers banded together to give him the boot.\n\nAt least one constitutional expert said that given the nature of the allegations against Trump \u2014 that he abused his power to enlist foreign help in next year\u2019s election \u2014 disqualifying him would be an illogical penalty.\n\n\u201cIf the impeachment is based on the Ukraine phone call and activity around that, and the idea is that he is improperly using his office to get dirt on his opponent, the remedy to that is to remove him from office,\u201d said Edward Foley, an election law authority and constitutional law professor at The Ohio State University\u2019s Moritz College of Law. \u201cIf the fear is the incumbent can\u2019t fight a fair fight, then disable the candidate\u2019s ability to not wage a fair fight.\u201d\n\nOf the eight federal judges who have been removed from the bench for crimes or misconduct, just three were disqualified from future office. The most notable person who was not barred was Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla. Hastings, a former federal district judge, was tossed out by the Senate in 1989 on bribery accusations despite being acquitted in a criminal trial, only to be elected in 1992 to the House, where he still serves. (Some scholars argue that an ousted federal officer could not be barred from running for Congress in any event.)", "description": "WASHINGTON -- With chances rapidly increasing that President Donald Trump will be impeached by the House and tried in the Senate, an intriguing question has reared its head: Could he be ousted only to try to return to the White House in 2020 in a Trumpian bid for redemption and revenge?Like so much of", "authors": ["Carl Hulse"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8.mRJx9r4iogoKxKWqTgzQ--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/3283d7f043176858f5d55bf60ced628d", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
