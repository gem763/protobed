It\u2019s one of the more controversial legacies of Michelle Rhee, who gained national recognition as the District\u2019s public schools chancellor from 2007 to 2010.\n\nRhee enacted the evaluation system unilaterally, without engaging the teachers union in negotiations. The implementation of IMPACT led to the firing of hundreds of teachers and produced heightened tensions between the school system and union that persist today.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIMPACT, which has existed in the District for a decade, has spurred similar evaluations in other school systems.\n\nWhen Ferebee started leading the city\u2019s schools in January, he said he sensed from teachers and principals that a culture of fear existed on campuses, where one misstep could lead to their firings.\n\nIMPACT came under fire during the city\u2019s 2018 graduation scandal, when a city-commissioned investigation determined that 1 in 3 graduates in 2017 received their diplomas despite missing too many classes or improperly taking makeup classes. Teachers said they feared their jobs might be at risk if they did not meet lofty graduation goals.\n\nElizabeth A. Davis, president of the Washington Teachers\u2019 Union, said she believes IMPACT relies on too many factors out of the control of educators. Students\u2019 standardized test scores, for example, are included in teacher evaluations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDavis said she will participate in the analysis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a first step, a long overdue step,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI have no idea what is going to result from reviewing IMPACT, but I do know that whatever happens that it needs to include teachers\u2019 [voices] in the final analysis, and that has not happened in the past.\u201d\n\nThe union has been pushing to give the teachers union substantial input in the system\u2019s design during collective bargaining. The D.C. Council introduced legislation in June that would give the union a say on IMPACT in contract negotiations, although the measure has not moved forward.\n\nDavis said she would still advocate for including IMPACT in contract negotiations, but Ferebee suggested he would not consider it.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that way for 10 years, and I do not see why would go down that path,\u201d Ferebee said.\n\nAD\n\nA report released this month from the National Council on Teacher Quality \u2014 a think tank focused on teacher evaluations and training \u2014 found that 33 states and the District use students\u2019 standardized test scores to evaluate teachers. That\u2019s a decline from 43 in 2015.\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit organization, published a study in 2013 that found teachers who received low scores on their evaluations were more likely to leave their jobs than high-scoring teachers who were close to earning a substantial merit raise.\n\nThe study \u2014 written by the University of Virginia\u2019s James H. Wyckoff and Stanford University\u2019s Thomas S. Dee \u2014 suggests that incentives of the variety that the District used \u201ccan substantially improve the measured performance of the teaching workforce.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOther national studies have shown that teacher evaluation systems have done little to improve teacher quality or student learning.\n\nAD\n\nCritics of the evaluation system have tied it to the District\u2019s teacher attrition rate, which the D.C. State Board of Education determined in 2018 is higher than those of other urban school districts on average.\n\nBut Ferebee pointed to an improvement in the trend in recent years. He said the city has experienced an increase of 8 percentage points in the teacher retention rate over the past 10 years. And he said nearly 84 percent of teachers who were assessed as \u201ceffective\u201d and \u201chighly effective\u201d returned to their schools this academic year.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI have heard teachers say they support IMPACT, that they think it\u2019s a necessary tool,\u201d said Zachary Parker, the Ward 5 representative on the D.C. State Board of Education. \u201cBut what I have often heard is that it is sometimes felt that it is a tool to punish teachers instead of to develop and support them.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The protocol was among the first nationally to tie student performance to educator pay and job security.", "authors": ["Perry Stein", "Reporter Covering D.C.
