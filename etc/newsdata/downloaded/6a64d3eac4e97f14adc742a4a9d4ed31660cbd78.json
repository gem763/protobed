For others, it is a hit HBO mini-series about the tragedy.\n\nFor a hardy few, it is home.\n\nThe 1986 catastrophe in northern Ukraine conjures up images up hazmat suits, deadly radioactive fires and crumbling derelict housing blocks. The fallout from the disaster could be measured some 1,500 miles away in Scotland just a few days later.\n\nBut some decided to defy all government and safety advice to move back to their family homes inside the exclusion zone \u2013 despite police efforts to move them on \u2013 while others never left at all.\n\nThe nuclear reactor in Chernobyl suffered its catastrophic meltdown after a experiment designed to test the safety of the power plant went horrendously wrong.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nA toxic fire spewed radiation for 10 days creating clouds that carried radioactive particles across Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe area immediately in and around the reactor will not be safe for another 20,000 years, give or take, but there is dispute about safety levels in the town.\n\nThe 100,000 people living closest to Chernobyl were taken outside the 20-mile exclusion zone imposed around the damaged reactor in the immediate aftermath. This was later expanded and over the next few months a quarter of a million people were displaced.\n\nEven so, some 150 to 300 people simply locked their doors and waited for the fuss to die down.\n\nThe population inside the exclusion zone has even begun to grow, with families relocating to the quiet, overwhelmingly cheap neighbourhoods that surround the site.\n\nChernobyl once had a population of 100,000 (Picture: sMediadrumimages/RobynVonSwank)\n\nMany of the 150 to 300 people who refused to leave live on their own (Picture:Mediadrumimages/RobynVonSwank)\n\nSome villages around the disaster site have populations measured in single figures: (Picture: Mediadrumimages/RobynVonSwank)\n\nCanadian photographer Robyn Von Swank has been documenting life inside the zone.\n\nShe expected to find a town full of ghosts but instead discovered dozens of people going about their daily lives even though it is illegal to live in the red zone.\n\nIt appears radiation was not the biggest immediate threat to her safety when she found she was being tracked by a pack of wolves.\n\nRobyn said: \u2018Thankfully, the predators have a bounty of prey to eat already, because the zone continues to grow as a biodiverse forest where animals don\u2019t worry about being killed by humans anymore.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The people were warm and welcoming and spoke openly about their histories. Some sobbed when speaking of the incident, having been affected so personally.\u2019\n\nOne of the residents, Maria, is the only living person in her village and is miles away from anyone else. Having survived the Nazi invasion in World War 2, the nuclear accident and lived under Soviet rule, she says she will never leave her home.\n\nIvan Ivanovich has met lots of curious tourists (Picture: Mediadrumimages/RobynVonSwank)\n\nHow most people see Chernobyl (Picture: NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nThe old gates signed \u2018The passage is forbidden, the object is guarded\u2019 near Chernobyl (Picture:Rex Features)\n\nAnother resident, Baba Olga was an elderly woman who never had children and rarely took in visitors.\n\nShe told the snapper of her once vibrant social life and, when Robyn left her house, stuffed the Canadian\u2019s pockets with treats before hugging and kissing her affectionately.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
