REUTERS/Mark Blinch\n\nAnalysts in a Reuters poll had forecast an inflation rate of 2.0%. Canada\u2019s annual inflation rate in July was 2.0%. After the data release, the Canadian dollar held steady near C$1.3250, or 75.47 U.S. cents.\n\nCanada is in the midst of a national election with polls showing the governing Liberals are in a tight bid for reelection against the opposition Conservatives, who have focused their campaign on issues related to the cost of living and affordability. Canadians vote on Oct. 21.\n\nConsumer prices for gasoline, Statistics Canada said, fell 10.2% in the 12 months to August following a 6.9% decline in July. Global oil prices also declined slightly in August, due to higher production and softer international demand.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of fresh vegetables dropped 6.5% in August from July - the largest month-over-month decline seen in five years - as temporary pressures because of inclement weather in agricultural regions eased.\n\nFresh and frozen pork were also cheaper, dropping 2.7% from July due to trade restrictions on Canadian pork exports. Despite the weaker pork prices, Statscan said the overall year-over-year cost for meat rose 4.8% in August.\n\nEarlier this month, the Bank of Canada held interest rates steady and made no mention of future cuts. The central bank, which has sat on the sidelines since last October, has said Canada\u2019s economy is showing a \u201cwelcome degree of resilience\u201d to negative shocks.\n\n\u201cFor the Bank of Canada, it means that unless the economy faces a significant shock, there\u2019s probably no imminent need to cut interest rates,\u201d said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist for BMO Capital Markets.\n\nCanadian airfare soared 10.3% year-over-year in August after a 4.6% jump in July, because of the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft, Statscan said.\n\nThat sustained increase surprised TD Securities\u2019 Robert Both. \u201cWe think when those (groundings) come off over the next couple of months that should take a little heat out of things,\u201d he said.\n\nCPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy\u2019s underperformance, fell to 1.8% from 1.9% in July.\n\nCPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, and CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, were both at 2.1%.", "description": "Canada's annual inflation rate fell slightly to 1.9% in August on lower gasoline prices, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday in its first major data release since Canadian politicians formally hit the campaign trail.", "authors": ["Kelsey Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431250791&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H130-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
