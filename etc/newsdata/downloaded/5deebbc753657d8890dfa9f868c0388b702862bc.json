So why are they moving to China?", "language": "en", "text": "Although still vulnerable, giant pandas no longer endangered\n\nIt\u2019s time for Calgary\u2019s twin giant pandas to leave the nest.\n\nBamboo nest, to be exact.\n\nAt four years old, Jian Panpan, a male, and Jia Yueyue, a female, are old enough to leave their parents and head out on their own.\n\nFor giant pandas \u2014 a species that was considered endangered for 26 years \u2014 that means flying all the way back to China to take part in a breeding program.\n\nGood news for the health of the species but bad news for the record-breaking crowds that have been watching the pandas grow up \u2014 first at the Toronto Zoo then the Calgary Zoo \u2014 since their birth in Canada in 2015.\n\nLet\u2019s face it, who doesn\u2019t love to watch pandas in action? Or even inaction, for that matter.\n\n\"Even when they're sleeping, they look cute,\" said Cissy Kou, zookeeper at the Calgary Zoo.\n\nFour giant pandas have been living at the Calgary Zoo since 2018: a mother, father and twin cubs. (Martin Trainor/CBC)\n\nAll giant pandas born outside of China eventually have to move there to take part in a program that helps them reproduce.\n\nGiant pandas were moved off the endangered list and onto the vulnerable list in 2016, following a push to restore their habitat and bring the species back from the brink.\n\nThere are around 1,900 giant pandas left on the planet, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s red list of threatened species.\n\nThat\u2019s around 650 more than there were back in the 1980s.\n\nThe black and white bears are considered an umbrella species, meaning that by protecting them, we\u2019re also protecting a whole bunch of other species that live in the same environment.\n\nThe four giant pandas at the Calgary Zoo eat around 1,100 kilograms of bamboo each week, which has to be flown in from China. (Nelly Alberola/CBC)\n\nNot to worry, panda fans, it\u2019s possible the Calgary Zoo may have another baby panda in the mix soon.\n\nThe twins\u2019 mother, Er Shun, might be pregnant again.\n\n\u201cNothing is guaranteed,\u201d Kou said. \u201cShe is showing that she might be, but we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nIf there is a new cub on the way, it won\u2019t get the chance to meet its brother and sister.\n\nThe twins are expected to board a plane for Chengdu, China, sometime after Oct. 6.\n\nBut first, the Calgary Zoo is hosting a farewell party from 10 a.m. MT to 2 p.m. MT from Oct. 4-6.\n\nIf you live out of province, you can livestream the whole family as they say their goodbyes on this handy dandy panda cam.\n\nHere\u2019s how panda twins Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue looked when they were five-month-old cubs living at the Toronto Zoo in 2016.
