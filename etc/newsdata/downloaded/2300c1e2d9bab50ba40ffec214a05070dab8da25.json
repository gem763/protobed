But then today Newegg\u2019s Canadian site accidentally listed the drone early (still up at the time of writing), seemingly confirming the new flying machine. Its key features? Being very small and very light.\n\nSo light, in fact, that it can avoid FAA registration, as pointed out by The Verge. At 249 grams, it comes in just one gram lighter than the FAA\u2019s threshold. Of course, you\u2019ll still need to follow your local ordinances \u2013 you still can\u2019t just fly it anywhere.\n\nThe listing says the drone has a max flight time of 30 minutes, can transmit HD video from up to four kilometers (2.5 miles) away and features a \u2018vision sensor\u2019 and \u2018GPS Precise hover.\u2019 The former is presumably for obstacle avoidance.\n\nThe camera is mounted on a 3-axis gimbal but is unfortunately limited to 2.7K. Still, that should be good enough for most people. It\u2019s possible this is due to a hardware limitation, or DJI might simply be trying to avoid encroaching on its pricier drones.\n\nSpeaking of price, the listing sets the price at a price of 645.20 Canadian dollars (about $494 USD). About $500 seems about right; it\u2019s the same price the entry-level Spark went for in 2017, but its extra small size will likely make the Mavic Mini appeal to a wider audience. DJI has an event planned for October 30, so don\u2019t be surprised if we hear more then.\n\nVia The Verge\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FSnag_41b51d91.png&signature=9aca1dfd8d1745abafea98ffc37830be", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
