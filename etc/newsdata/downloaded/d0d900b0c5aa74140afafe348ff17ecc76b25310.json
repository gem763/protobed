An IAAF World Athletics Championships that would welcome the world and connect to new fans. Despite facing unique challenges as hosts, in terms of the political (boycott), that ambition remains,\u201d it said.\n\nThe four boycotting nations have, however, sent athletes to Doha, and Bahrain won bronze in the 4x400 mixed relay.\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing,\u201d said Stefanidi. \u201cI was all for bringing the event to new areas, different environments like the Middle East too because we needed to promote the sport.\u201d\n\nHowever, women\u2019s 100 metres winner Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce was indifferent.\n\n\u201cI actually did notice the stadium wasn\u2019t full but it\u2019s part of athletics,\u201d the Jamaican said after Sunday\u2019s race. \u201cDoha got the rights to host the championship, you just have to give and take. I just wanted to put on a good performance focus, I tried not to focus on the crowd.\u201d\n\nJustin Gatlin, silver medallist in the men\u2019s 100 metres on Saturday, took a similar view, saying: \u201cWhen we are on the track, I think it doesn\u2019t matter whether there are 100 people watching or 100,000 people watching. We want to be able to put on a great show.\u201d\n\nThe LOC said the athletes competing at the Khalifa Stadium have \u201crelished the experience\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe controlled temperature conditions on the track have been ideal and fitting for world-class performances and will remain so,\u201d it said.", "description": "The embarrassingly low attendance at the world athletics championships was blamed on late start times and a boycott of the country by other nations in the region by the event's organisers on Monday.", "authors": ["Brian Homewood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435660532&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T14A", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
