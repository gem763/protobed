You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe feature, which has now been rolled out across the globe and was announced on Bumble's Instagram account, was championed by Whitney Wolfe Herd, founder and CEO of Bumble, and Andrey Andreev, founder of MagicLab, which owns dating apps Badoo, Bumble, Lumen and Chappy.\n\nTexas-born Wolfe Herd recently worked with lawmakers in the US state to make the sharing of unsolicited lewd photographs a punishable crime, legislation that came into effect in August.\n\nWhen a Bumble user is sent an image or message that the Private Detector tool has deemed inappropriate, a message appears on their screen to alert them.\n\nThey are then offered the option to tap to reveal the picture or message in question.\n\n\u201cThe digital world can be a very unsafe place overrun with lewd, hateful and inappropriate behaviour,\u201d said Wolfe Herd.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s limited accountability, making it difficult to deter people from engaging in poor behaviour.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
