Part of it, La Campi\u00f1a, a region of Seville province, appears largely empty. But over ploughed fields and olive groves there are towers and ramparts, the hazy outlines of towns founded in antiquity. Over the centuries, these have been built up by Romans, Vandals, Visigoths, Arabs \u2013 who created the Islamic caliphate of Al-Andalus \u2013 medieval knights, religious orders, and a who\u2019s who of Spanish nobility granted land and cash in reward for helping kings.\n\nThe compact ancient cities of Carmona, \u00c9cija and Osuna \u2013 sitting in a triangle that starts just 30 minutes east of Seville city \u2013 are the islands in La Campi\u00f1a\u2019s sea of farmland where the rich history is easily accessible, thanks to a plethora of museums, monuments, annotated maps, helpful hoteliers and tourist offices. Although, with the past woven into the fabric of the present, just to be here is to time travel. Those with more time should also explore Marchena and Estepa further south.\n\nCarmona\n\nSome 35km east of Seville, you\u2019ll be zig-zagging up wooded hills in search of Carmona and - whoa! - driving under a vast gate in the city walls and along narrow cobbled streets and emerging around the Plaza San Fernando, edging past the bar spill of chairs and tables, and reversing down one-way streets while looking for somewhere to park. All to the deafening accompaniment of bells tolling on all sides.\n\nCarmona has an ancient Carthaginian/Roman defensive gate, the Puerta de Sevilla (built around 220BC and incorporated centuries later into an Arab alc\u00e1zar or fortress), and beyond it, a necropolis and excavated urns and statues displayed onsite. Who came next and built what is depicted, in order, in the Museo de la Ciudad, a 16th-century palace.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Plaza de Abastos. Photograph: Alamy\n\nBut Carmona\u2019s beauty derives from the high white walls of churches, convents and palaces, the bell towers (espada\u00f1as) and normal life \u2013 vendors in the colonnaded Plaza de Abastos, children chasing each other through the alleys, the congregation fanning themselves in the muted light of the Iglesia de Santa Maria. Few towns are better suited to aimless wandering.\n\nStay at the Casa-Palacio de Carmona (doubles from \u20ac98 B&B, Calle Miraflores de Santa Maria 1), a 17th-century renaissance palace built by a conquistador returned from Peru, with loggia and patios, grand staircase and galleries, and heavy wooden doors with knockers so high you need to be sat on a horse to reach them. Lounging in this spectacular, eccentric place \u2013 propped against monographed pillows \u2013 feels a little like being locked in a National Trust property.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Casa Palacio de Carmona\n\nExquisite local dishes include alboron\u00eda (an Andaluc\u00edan ratatouille, with Arabic roots), arroz de se\u00f1orito andaluz (seafood and rice) and mushrooms topped with Pajarete mousse \u2013 all of which can be sampled at Molino de la Romera (tapas \u20ac3, Sor Angela de la Cruz 8), a 10-minute walk from Porta de Sevilla along Cala San Felipe to the eastern edge of town. It\u2019s in a former olive mill and is enchantingly rustic, with whitewashed walls and courtyard. Once you reach here, the town is done; below the bluff there is nothing at night but the lights of small towns in the far distance.\n\n\u00c9cija\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, \u00c9cija. Photograph: Kate Hockenhull/Alamy\n\nAround 55km east of Carmona along the via Augusta, or A-4, the longest and busiest Roman road in ancient Hispania, lies bustling \u00c9cija. In the 18th century, it was home to 40 noble families and their money and love of all things baroque precipitated a building boom and golden age and it became known as \u201ccity of towers\u201d and \u201ccity of palaces\u201d \u2013 there are 11 church towers and 17 palaces within five minutes of the Plaza de Espa\u00f1a. Due to its extreme summer temperatures it has also been dubbed \u201cthe frying pan of Spain\u201d \u2013 an evocative epithet which has done much to protect it from mass tourism.\n\nThe churches are magnificent outside (see Iglesia de Santa Cruz, half-ruined by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake) and in \u2013 the baroque altarpiece at the Iglesia de los Descalzos is a match for Seville Cathedral\u2019s. There\u2019s plenty of respectful gasping at glory to be had in the palaces too: peek inside the Palace of Justice (a micro Alhambra not open to the public), then visit three that are. The Palacio de los Palma, where the original furniture and paraphernalia \u2013 toys, fan collection, sepia photographs \u2013 left in the shuttered salons is like a period film set. The Palacio de Pe\u00f1aflor, by contrast, is light, cool, airy and joyful. Then there\u2019s the formidable Palacio de Benamej\u00ed, which houses the tourist office, a courtyard restaurant and the Museo Hist\u00f3rica.\n\n\u00c9cija is built on, and partly out of, the Roman city of Astigi; Roman pillars of Egyptian granite are used on every corner to protect churches and palaces from knocks from horses and carriages. Construction of the car park beneath the Plaza in 2002 unearthed priceless detritus from a temple and one of the world\u2019s most perfectly preserved classical statues, the 2,000-year-old Amazona Herida, now exhibited in the museum alongside mosaic floors found elsewhere, one depicting a very visceral encounter between Leda and the Swan.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Domus Astigi. Photograph: Jose Bosco Morales Aguilar\n\nStay at Domus Astigi (doubles from \u20ac60 B&B, Calle Cava 22), a casa-palacio that encapsulates everything wonderful about \u00c9cija in its architecture and design: Moorish patio with fountain and palms; Roman pillars and archeological finds, from a chunk of mosaic floor to surgical instruments; fabulous chest-high antique wall tiles throughout (Don Quijote is depicted across four walls); and old Sevillana grandeur in the dark wood, opaque mirrors, chandeliers and vitrinas of library and salons. Then there\u2019s the hospitality provided by owner Antonio Cascales and manager Juan D\u00edaz. There are only four rooms \u2013 but I can\u2019t recommend this place highly enough.\n\nEat at Casa Machin (Calle Galindo 4), an elegant restaurant with tables in the bar. If you ask for three tapas tipicas you\u2019ll probably get salmorejo (plenty of egg, crispy chorizo, olive oil), scoops of creamy espinacas labradas (spinach, fried bread, cumin, garlic), and salty crispy fish on a slice of fresh tomato \u2013 one of the best lunches I can remember, for \u20ac14 including wine.\n\nOsuna\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Calle San Pedro, Osuna. Photograph: Alamy\n\nOsuna is 35km south of \u00c9cija down the A-351, past castles and ruins, isolated cortijos, olives groves and open space. Smaller and more rural, but Osuna also has its streets of palaces \u2013 Calle San Pedro has been called one of the most beautiful in Europe, although as many people come to visit the bullring which appears in Game of Thrones (The Great Pit of Daznak in series five). And there is plenty more for fans of the otherworldly and fantastical on the town\u2019s windy hilltop.\n\nThe stark old university is quite empty. The Ducal Pantheon (entry \u20ac3) beside it, however, contains the remains of several Dukes of Osuna (responsible for building almost everything around) and the guided tour is an unmissable, giddying creepy trip through underground crypts of ornate splendour.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Monastery de la Encarnaci\u00f3n. Photograph: Jeronimo Alba/Alamy\n\nOpposite, at the Monastery de la Encarnaci\u00f3n (\u20ac3.50), ring the bell and you\u2019ll eventually be collected by a nun for a private tour of golden chapels, sacred art and treasures, culminating in a room of baby Jesuses, their collections of outfits and solid silver shoes \u2013 and then sold lottery tickets before being ushered out. Also up here is Las Canteras, the sandstone quarry dug for millennia, whose carvings and giant chambers have a distinctly Star Wars look, and an abandoned Roman necropolis, the empty graves (you can get in them if you are short) overlooked by a farmyard.\n\nOne of the best places to stay is La Casona de Calder\u00f3n (doubles from \u20ac70 B&B, Plaza Cervantes 16), an award-winning 17th-century hotel-museo. Operating as an inn when many writers of the romantic movement, most notably Washington Irving, were passing through, it was later a farmhouse where cheese was made, produce sold, and living space split between people and animals. Elena Calder\u00f3n inherited and lovingly restored it. Leading off a coral patio, 17 unique rooms are furnished with art and antiques (many Elena\u2019s grandmother\u2019s), with old farming artefacts exhibited throughout and named for their previous uses: La Cuadra (where cows lived), La Pajareta (the hay loft), the Cocinilla (a high-ceilinged kitchen used for pig slaughter \u2013 surprisingly romantic). Fascinating, elegant, full of warmth and charm.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest La Casona de Calder\u00f3n\n\nFor tapas (average \u20ac3) try Casa Curro (Plaza Salitre 5) where about 200 options are scrawled on blackboards in the old-school bar, from quails eggs and jam\u00f3n, to pork cheek in Pedro Ximenez sherry, clams, and wild boar and the soft throat of tuna with mermelada de lim\u00f3n (a lemon marmalade). Fabulous food whipped up fresh and slapped down without fanfare. And, as you\u2019ll see from the photos on the wall, it was popular with the cast and crew of Game of Thrones too.\n\nGetting there\n\nCarmona is a 40-minute bus ride from Seville (\u20ac5 each way); \u00c9cija is an hour by bus from Cordoba or Seville (\u20ac7); Osuna has a railway station (10-15 minutes\u2019 walk from the centre) and has regular services from Seville Santa Justa station that take just over an hour (\u20ac11.50 each way). Buses to Osuna take a little longer and cost from about \u20ac5. Buses to all three towns leave from Seville\u2019s Prado de San Sebastian bus station.\n\nLooking for a holiday with a difference?
