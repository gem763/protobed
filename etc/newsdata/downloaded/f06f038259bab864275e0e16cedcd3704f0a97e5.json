We\u2019re not going to put anyone in an uncomfortable position.\u201d\n\nThe Association of Tennis Professionals, which governs men's matches, follows a similar protocol, though the men are allowed two bathroom breaks during a best-of-five match (the women have just one break but play shorter matches, needing to win two sets out of three). The U.S. Open and other Grand Slam tournaments, which all have their own rule books, follow the WTA and ATP guidelines regarding bathroom breaks.\n\nThe breaks are prevalent even at the lower rungs of the sport, where they border on the absurd.\n\nAt one pro circuit tournament in Lexington, Ky., this summer , Yuxuan Zhang, who was ranked just outside the top 200, lost the first set of her quarterfinal match, 6-1, in only 24 minutes. Instead of recovering in her courtside chair during the two-minute changeover, she left for the bathroom. She returned nearly 10 minutes later, saying the bathroom was far away from her court. She lost the second set, 6-0, after another 33 minutes.", "description": "So many players were claiming restroom time during matches that \u2026 excuse us, we\u2019ll be right back.", "authors": ["Cindy Shmerler"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/31/sports/31open-bathrooms/31open-bathrooms-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
