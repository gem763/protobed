Council member Jack Evans and Metro officials, after reviewing the transit agency\u2019s ethics investigation of the former Metro Board chairman and again calling into question D.C. statehood ahead of a preliminary hearing next week.\n\n\u201cUnder the Democrats\u2019 bill, the current D.C. government would be elevated to governor, members of the state legislature, etc.,\u201d a spokesman for House Republicans said Tuesday. \u201cIf Congress is to provide for the creation of a new state, it should at least make sure that its citizens won\u2019t labor under the same corrupt government, which is more interested in lining its own pockets than serving its people.\u201d\n\nThe top two Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Committee on Tuesday sent a letter to Reps. Elijah E. Cummings, Maryland Democrat and committee chairman, and Gerry Connolly, Virginia Democrat and chairman of government operations subcommittee, urging them to interview five people who were involved with the Metro Board\u2019s ethics probe of Mr. Evans.\n\nIn addition to Mr. Evans, the Republicans are seeking interviews with former Metro Board Vice Chairman Clarence Crawford, Metro Assistant General Manager Lynn Bowersox, Metro Board Secretary Jennifer Ellison and Metro General Counsel Patricia Lee.\n\n\u201cThe information produced to the committee to date suggests that Evans, a District of Columbia (DC) Council member, attempted to exploit his position on the [Metro] Board for his personal financial benefit,\u201d Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, ranking Republican on the Oversight Committee, and Mark Meadows of North Carolina, ranking member of the government operations subcommittee, said in the letter. \u201cThe committee must conduct additional fact finding as it relates to several upcoming legislative and oversight matters.\u201d\n\nMr. Cummings did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cThe documents provided to our Committee confirm my serious concerns about Mr. Evans\u2018 unethical behavior as Chairman of the [Metro] Board,\u201d Mr. Connolly said in a written response. \u201cWe can\u2019t turn a blind eye to this type of self-dealing and threats. This, as well as Metro safety improvements, will be one of the many issues we will examine in our October hearing.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
