Hill testified earlier this month in the secret room in the basement of the Capitol building from which Democrats have been running their private impeachment proceedings.\n\nBarnes, Goldman, and Fandos wrote:\n\nFiona Hill, the National Security Council\u2019s former senior director for Eurasian and Russian affairs, testified to House investigators last week that she believed Mr. Patel was improperly becoming involved in Ukraine policy and was sending information to Mr. Trump, some of the people said. Ms. Hill grew alarmed earlier this year when an aide from the White House executive secretary\u2019s office told her that Mr. Trump wanted to talk to Mr. Patel and identified him as the National Security Council\u2019s \u2018Ukraine director,\u2019 a position held by one of Ms. Hill\u2019s deputies. The aide said Mr. Trump wanted to meet with Mr. Patel about documents he had received on Ukraine. Ms. Hill responded by asking who Mr. Patel was. While the aide from the executive secretary\u2019s office did not state explicitly that Mr. Patel sent the Ukraine documents to Mr. Trump, Ms. Hill understood that to be the implication, according to a person familiar with her testimony.\n\nAs the Times notes, if true, this would mean there were multiple backchannels for Trump on Ukraine matters\u2014the other being through his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Giuliani\u2019s associates\u2014and it would make it appear as though Trump was up to something by circumventing established channels for such policy, even though the president as the nation\u2019s chief executive officer is well within his rights to do that.\n\nBut the problem with the Times story, and its sources that appear to be leaks from Democrats of Hill\u2019s testimony, is that the entire premise is untrue, sources familiar with Patel\u2019s meetings with the president told Breitbart News. Since the Times published its story, Breitbart News has spoken with a dozen sources including current White House officials, then-current-now-former White House officials, congressional officials familiar with the investigation and the meetings Patel had with President Trump, and others in the know about what actually happened and discovered that Patel\u2019s meetings with President Trump had \u201cabsolutely nothing,\u201d in the words of one source, to do with Ukraine whatsoever.\n\nOne now-former White House official confirmed that President Trump did in fact meet with Patel on a number of occasions, though it\u2019s unclear if these were one-on-one meetings or there were others present.\n\nA source close to House GOP leadership told Breitbart News that Patel\u2019s meetings with the president were focused on domestic national security matters, and that Ukraine did not come up at all.\n\nThat source said of the Times story:\n\nThis story is complete nonsense. The meeting was arranged at the suggestion of multiple GOP congressmen and senators to discuss domestic national security issues that Kash has specific knowledge and unique expertise in. This meeting had absolutely nothing to do with Ukraine.\n\nA second well-placed source familiar with Patel\u2019s interactions with the president told Breitbart News that the Times story that relies on Hill\u2019s testimony\u2014leaked by Democrats\u2014is \u201c100 percent false.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe New York Times story is 100 percent false,\u201d this source familiar with Patel\u2019s interactions with Trump told Breitbart News. \u201cKash did not discuss Ukraine with Trump in any meeting, nor did he discuss any Ukraine-related documents with him. The Democrats involved in the impeachment interviews were obviously tipped off that Fiona Hill would invent some story like this if asked about Kash, and that\u2019s why they brought up his name to her, then they leaked the exchange to their lackeys at the Times.\u201d\n\nHill, Breitbart News has learned, was asked a number questions about Patel by the Democrats during her testimony, and a source in the room said her \u201cresponses appeared scripted,\u201d suggesting that there was some coordination between Hill or her lawyers and the Democrats on Capitol Hill before her appearance.\n\nThen, as has happened with so much more that has gone on in the secretive U.S. Capitol basement room in which House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) is running the impeachment proceedings away from public view, this information was leaked to the Times and weaponized against the president and his administration\u2014the actual truth and facts be damned.\n\nThis episode paints a broader and darker picture of what exactly Schiff and his team are doing in the secretive room and raises bigger questions about why Schiff is not holding these hearings in public.\n\nThe system Democrats have set up basically goes as such: They bring witnesses in for testimony and depositions and transcribed interviews for hours on end to a private room known as a Secure Compartmentalized Information Facility (SCIF)\u2013behind closed doors and away from the press and public.\n\nThey allow no lawyers for the administration inside to challenge anything, present facts in defense of the president, or hear what\u2019s happening down there. Then, Schiff and his team control the information gathered and collected down there\u2014not allowing the minority sufficient access to it.\n\nAfter that, Schiff, his team, and other Democrats leak the most damaging information to the media\u2014usually out of context, and without the full story\u2014in order to create a public narrative that the president is in serious trouble.\n\nThen it takes a couple days at least for Republicans to get the full truth out about each of these instances to turn around the narrative and expose each \u201cfact\u201d the Democrats are putting forward as flawed. This latest example saw the Times story on Hill\u2019s testimony as the official public record on this matter, until now, for about a full day.\n\nTechnically speaking, Hill did make these claims that the Times reported in her testimony\u2014but the veracity of them was never checked by the Democrats who gathered said testimony then leaked it to the New York Times for publication.\n\nThe Times also did not check their veracit, even though the first source who spoke to Breitbart News, the one close to House GOP leadership who confirmed Hill\u2019s claims were false, noted that Hill\u2019s inaccurate claims were reproduced uncritically by the Times based upon Democrat leaks. And the Times, this source said, as an institution was aware of the fact that Hill\u2019s claims were false because a separate White House correspondent at the Times was aware of Patel\u2019s meetings with the president at the time of said meetings well before Hill\u2019s testimony happened and well before Democrats even launched an impeachment inquiry\u2014and that this Times reporter was aware that the content had nothing to do with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s particularly shameful is that at least one New York Times White House reporter was told about this meeting in advance off the record, and knew what this meeting was about\u2014and that it was not about Ukraine\u2014but they printed this fake story anyway,\u201d the source close to House GOP leadership told Breitbart News.\n\nPart of the reason the media and the Democrats wanted to smear Patel and attempt to tie him into the impeachment madness, the second source who was familiar with Patel\u2019s conversations with the president said, is because Patel was critical of exposing the failures of the narrative surrounding the previous attempts by the so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d to entangle Trump in a scandal on the Russia narrative.\n\n\u201cThe story is a lazy hit piece based entirely on rumors and purported second-hand and third-hand information,\u201d that source told Breitbart News. \u201cBoth the Times and the Democrats have a vendetta against Kash because he helped blow up their three-year investment in the Russia hoax.\u201d\n\nIn fact, this is evident by the fact that the Times story actually opens with a recounting of Patel\u2019s history as an aide on the House Intelligence Committee when Republicans were in the majority and his role in exposing what has become known as \u201cSpygate.\u201d\n\nBarnes, Goldman, and Fandos wrote to open their article, before they even got into the substance of the new but false allegations that Hill leveled against Patel over meetings with the president:\n\nWhen Kashyap Patel was an aide to the House Intelligence Committee in the first years of the Trump administration, he played a key role in helping Republicans try to undermine the Russia investigation, writing a memo that accused law enforcement officials of abusing their power. The memo, which consumed Washington for weeks, was widely dismissed as a biased argument of cherry-picked facts. But it galvanized President Trump\u2019s allies and made Mr. Patel a hero among them. After Republicans ceded control of Congress this year, he landed on Mr. Trump\u2019s National Security Council staff.\n\nLater in the story, the Times reporters further explain Patel\u2019s role in exposing the Russia scandal as a hoax designed to harm the president.\n\n\u201cMr. Patel was previously best known as a lead author of the politically charged memo released early last year accusing the F.B.I. and Justice Department leaders of abusing their power in the early stages of the Russia investigation,\u201d Barnes, Goldman, and Fandos wrote. \u201cMr. Patel worked at the time as an investigator for the House Intelligence Committee under Representative Devin Nunes of California, who ran the panel when Republicans had control of the chamber. Mr. Patel\u2019s efforts to discredit the Russia investigation made him a minor celebrity in conservative circles but a divisive figure on Capitol Hill.\u201d", "description": "The NYT published what would have been a major story on WH National Security Council (NSC) aide Kash Patel\u2014if only it had been true.", "authors": ["Matthew Boyle"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/the-new-york-times-building-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
