REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/\n\nThe U.S. trade war with China caused the stock market to seesaw in August. The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, rose around 17.7% last month, the second-biggest monthly jump so far in 2019. Last month was also the worst August for U.S. stocks in four years.\n\nMarket volatility can prevent IPOs from going ahead because it makes it difficult for investment bankers to price them by balancing demand and supply for the shares on offer. However, August is traditionally a slow month for IPOs due to the summer holidays. Only seven IPOs took place last month.\n\nBy contrast, almost 70 companies have registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO, according to research firm Renaissance Capital, which estimates companies could raise more than $15 billion from September until the end of 2019.\n\nWeWork owner The We Company, food delivery platform Postmates Inc and fitness startup Peloton Interactive are among the companies expected to launch IPOs by the end of the year. Representatives for the three companies declined to comment on their IPO plans.\n\n\u201cI can safely say that this has been one of busiest Augusts we have ever had in terms of IPOs getting geared up for September,\u201d said David Goldschmidt, global head of capital markets at U.S. law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.\n\nThe U.S. market for IPOs typically gets back up to full speed once dealmakers and investors return to work after the Monday Labor Day holiday.\n\nSo far in 2019, companies have raised $36.5 billion through IPOs, down slightly on the same point in 2018 but the third most active year since the 2008 financial crisis, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.\n\nWhile the shares of this year\u2019s two most high-profile IPOs, Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) and Lyft Inc (LYFT.O), have performed poorly after their flotation, most IPOs have fared well in 2019.\n\nRenaissance Capital\u2019s IPO-focused exchange-traded fund </IPO> is up more than 30 percent so far in 2019, around double the rise in the S&P 500 Index over the same period. Strong IPO performers have included plant-based burger maker Beyond Meat Inc (BYND.O) and video conferencing company Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O).\n\n\u201cConditions could all change with a tweet (such as from U.S. President Donald Trump) but, when you look at the overall market backdrop, it feels maybe not perfect but still very good for IPOs,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Donovan, partner in investment bank PJT Partners Inc\u2019s (PJT.N) strategic advisory business.\n\nUNPREDICTABLE IPO WINDOW\n\nIn the background for companies weighing the timing of their IPO, is whether or not political rhetoric from U.S. presidential candidates could make for even rougher conditions.\n\nThe run-up to a U.S. presidential election has typically not had a major impact on prospective IPOs, though the November 2020 face-off between Republican Trump and a Democratic challenger is expected by market participants to trigger more volatility, given the polarization in U.S. politics.\n\n\u201cWe are urging companies to be ready as soon as possible because the IPO windows have been so unpredictable,\u201d said Andrew Fabens, partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and co-chair of the law firm\u2019s capital markets practice.\n\nThe likes of home-sharing company Airbnb Inc, payments startup Stripe and job search platform ZipRecruiter are expected to pursue IPOs next year, and it is unclear how close their IPOs would be to the presidential election.\n\nSpokesman for Airbnb and ZipRecruiter declined to comment on a possible IPO. Stripe did respond to a request for comment.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The WeWork logo is displayed outside of a co-working space in New York City, New York U.S., January 8, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\n\u201cIt would be incorrect to say the IPO window closes around elections,\u201d said Alex Wellins, co-founder of IPO advisory and investor relations firm Blueshirt Group LLC.\n\n\u201cThat said,\u201d Wellins added, \u201cmost people expect very high levels of volatility around this particular election.\u201d\n\n(This story corrects to show the CBOE Volatility index rose 17.7% last month, not around 12%)", "description": "U.S. companies planning to launch initial public offerings (IPOs) in the coming weeks are hoping that August's bout of stock market volatility will subside this month, according to investment bankers and capital markets lawyers advising them.", "authors": ["Joshua Franklin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425728089&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF820V7", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
