TMZ reported that Jamie filed paperwork stating his intention to step down from the roles so he could focus on his health. The conservatorship Jamie held over Britney's estate was permanent, and co-held by an attorney. He plans to resume his role in January, TMZ reports.\n\nThis is the latest in a string of incidents that have concerned fans as Spears appeared to back away from the public eye, even sparking a \"#FreeBritney\" trend in April after Spears spent time at a wellness facility early this year when fans worried that she was being held against her will. However, her team has insisted all is well and the singer was attending to her family.\n\nIn January, Britney, 37, postponed all tours indefinitely after Jamie \"almost died\" when his colon spontaneously ruptured, and he ended up spending 28 days in a hospital.\n\nHe now intends to pass the conservator role temporarily to Jodi Montgomery, a woman described by Jamie as Britney's \"care manager,\" PEOPLE reports.\n\nBut a police report was also filed prior to Jamie's papers by Kevin Federline, the father of Britney's two sons, after an \"altercation\" between Jamie and 13-year-old Sean, where her other son Jaden, 12, was present.\n\nRead more: 'Don't come for me or the ones I love anymore': Jamie Lynn Spears slams critics as a conspiracy theory that Britney is being held against her will spreads\n\nflickr.com\n\nApparently, on August 24, Jamie \"got very angry\" with his grandson and broke down a door in the process of the altercation, PEOPLE reports. A day later, Federline filed that Jamie had physically assaulted Sean.\n\nA source told PEOPLE that \"Britney got upset as well and ended their visit with Jamie.\" Both of Federline and Spears' children were granted a restraining order against Jamie.\n\nFederline also got his custody arrangement with Spears adjusted after the incident, with him now receiving 90% custody. Spears' 10% custody visits are required to be supervised.\n\nPreviously, the couple had shared a 50/50 custody split. Apparently, a 70-30 arrangement has been in place since 2018, but was seemingly finalized days after the police report was filed.\n\nTMZ also reported that Britney's mother Lynne Spears and her lawyer plan to be present at the court hearing regarding Jamie's conservatorship, with the outlet assuming that Lynne will challenge the transfer of power to Montgomery. Lynne has previously requested involvement in the conservatorship case, especially as it pertains to medical issues.", "description": "After a rumored altercation with her 13-year-old son, Britney Spears' father Jamie is asking a judge to temporarily end his conservatorship over her.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d757614f4fc247f7c7f03af-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
