His appearance has offered Senate Democrats a rare chance to quiz a top Trump administration official on issues related to the House-led impeachment inquiry into Trump \u2014 and they are taking full advantage of the opportunity.\n\nSullivan was grilled in particular by New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, on impeachment-related topics, including the propriety of what Trump is accused of doing: pressuring Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate a political rival, former vice president Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cSoliciting investigations into a domestic political opponent\u2014I don\u2019t think that would be in accord with our values,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nThe diplomat acknowledged that he was the one who informed Foreign Service veteran Marie Yovanovitch that she was being pulled out early from her post as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. But he said that despite trying to find out why, he was never given any reason other than Trump had lost confidence in her.\n\nYovanovitch was the victim of a drumbeat of allegations led by allies of Trump, according to documents turned over to Congress by the State Department inspector general. Sullivan said he was aware of the smear campaign and believed that Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, was involved.\n\nHe also said he was looped in when the State Department was given a packet of material that appeared to be aimed at denigrating Yovanovitch. \u201cIt didn\u2019t provide to me a basis for taking action against our ambassador,\u201d said Sullivan of the packet, which Giuliani is suspected of helping put together.\n\nSullivan said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had tried to find out exactly why Trump was unhappy with Yovanovitch, but that after several months, the reason \u2014 which Sullivan said he was never told \u2014 became irrelevant because it was clear the president wanted her out.\n\nSullivan said he thought Yovanovitch was an excellent diplomat. She testified before House impeachment investigators earlier this month, sharing that he\u2019d told her she\u2019d \u201cdone nothing wrong,\u201d but was being pulled out early anyway, just weeks after being asked to extend her stay.\n\nSullivan said he was not aware of all of the machinations involving Ukraine policy, but made clear that he did know Giuliani was playing an outside role in shaping it. His focus, though, was largely limited to Giuliani\u2019s attacks on Yovanovitch, Sullivan said.\n\nSullivan is a relatively well-regarded figure on Capitol Hill, and his nomination to serve as the U.S. envoy in Moscow is expected to make it through the Senate. One of the people who introduced him on Wednesday was Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, a member of the committee.", "description": "Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan was questioned by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.", "authors": ["Nahal Toosi", "Quint Forgey", "Andrew Desiderio", "Kyle Cheney"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1184009153-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
