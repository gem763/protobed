What a time to be alive.\"\n\nPEN America said it was \"dumbfounded by the selection of a writer who has used his public voice to undercut historical truth\", in a statement from its president, Jennifer Egan.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @PENamerica \"We are dumbfounded by the selection of a writer who has used his public voice to undercut historical truth & offer public succor to perpetrators of genocide,\" says PEN America President @Egangoonsquad on Peter Handke receiving Nobel Prize in Literature: https://t.co/sKfeqYszeL. \u2014 PEN America (@PENamerica) October 10, 2019 Report\n\nBritish author Hari Kunzru also criticised the decision. He told the Guardian: \"More than ever we need public intellectuals who are able to make a robust defence of human rights in the face of the indifference and cynicism of our political leaders. Handke is not such a person.\"", "description": "The Austrian writer voiced support for the Serbs during the 1990s Yugoslav war.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8EE2/production/_109187563_057199730-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
