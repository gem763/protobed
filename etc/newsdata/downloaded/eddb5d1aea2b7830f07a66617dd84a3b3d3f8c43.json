We weren\u2019t familiar with the intricacies of male skincare and found this a great experience.\n\nListen fam, it\u2019s almost year end and with this comes accepting that men, too, do need a little extra work. I\u2019m not saying go and get a face-beat, unless you feel so inclined, but I recommend that you do a bit more than soap and water.\n\nBefore my facial (R335) they did a face map on me \u2013 this is when one of the in-store specialists lightly feels your face and tells you which parts are dry or oily and what you should use on them.\n\nApplying sun protection daily is key and, with the climate crisis escalating, black can indeed crack.\n\nA brow-raising fact I learnt was that most of the skin creams we use have alcohol in them. This can dehydrate the skin so a lot of these simply sit on the skin and don\u2019t get absorbed. Alcohol-free products might be the answer.\n\nTOP FIVE GROOMING TIPS FROM SORBET MAN STAFF:\n\nHygiene is paramount \u2013 make sure you see your barber washes their hands and the equipment before they start to groom you.\n\nAlways shave with the grain to avoid bumps, pimples and irritation.\n\n. Sometimes alcohol-free aftershaves are better for your skin.\n\nTry to get a manicure and pedicure once every month to keep your hands and feet smooth.\n\nIf you feel pain during any of your treatments make sure it is addressed immediately. Grooming is meant to be pleasurable, not painful.\n\nKEY TREATMENTS\n\nPedicure (R260): This was a first-time experience for me and I was surprised by how smooth and painless my feet were afterwards. Shiny nails are your best friend.\n\nParaffin dip for hands and feet (R115):Paraffin dips are treatments with melted wax that make you look like a penguin, but make you feel like an aristocrat. They help with joint pain and muscle pain and soften your skin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Sorbet Man invited #Trending to experience the many ways in which male skin and hair care for men has progressed.
