According to Variety, Bret McKenzie has signed on to write the screenplay and music for a new adaptation of Jim Henson\u2019s Emmet Otter\u2019s Jug-Band Christmas, based on the titular book by author Russell Hoban. For those who haven\u2019t seen it, the 1977 ABC special follows the (furry, water-resistant) tale of Emmet and Ma, an impoverished otter family who decides to enter a Christmas talent show in the hopes of taking home the contest\u2019s cash prize, provided the Riverbottom Nightmare Band doesn\u2019t steal the show. Kermit the Frog also makes an appearance as the omniscient narrator.\n\nMcKenzie is no stranger to the extended Muppet Cinematic Universe, having worked as the musical supervisor for 2011\u2019s The Muppets and 2014\u2019s Muppets Most Wanted, winning him a Best Original Song Oscar for Muppets\u2019 \u201cMan or Muppet.\u201d Per Variety, the Flight of the Conchords member also has the option to direct, which, if we\u2019re talking Muppets, he absolutely should take. If nothing else, this is Bret McKenzie\u2019s chance to have the second cutest blooper reel on the internet.", "description": "One half of the Flight of the Concords duo, Bret McKenzie, will adapt a remake of Jim Henson\u2019s Emmet Otter\u2019s Jug-Band Christmas.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/22/22-brett-mckenzie.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
