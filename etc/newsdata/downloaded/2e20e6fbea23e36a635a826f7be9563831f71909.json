Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) wrote to the IRS asking it to look into the NRA\u2019s tax-exempt status following a report from the Senate Finance Committee Democratic minority staff that investigated the relationship between the NRA and the Russian government.\n\nThis came after the NRA\u2019s relationship with foreign agent Maria Butina and Russian government official Alexander Torshin was made public, along with a controversial 2015 trip to Moscow made by NRA board members and backers. Wyden has asserted that the Russian government was using the pro-gun group to access the U.S. political system ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nGrassley referred to Wyden and Schumer\u2019s letter as one \u201cthat demonstrates nothing that reasonably calls into question the organization\u2019s tax-exempt status under the law. Rather, the request appears to be a partisan one. The IRS is not a political weapon, and it should not be used as such.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing nearly identical evidence as the Minority staff at great length, it was clear to the Majority staff that nothing in those documents reasonably raises questions about whether the NRA should maintain its tax-exempt status under the tax code,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cIndeed, rather than present a careful and serious analysis, the Minority staff report offers incendiary conclusions unsupported by paragraphs full of belabored references to behavior that \u2018raises serious\u2019 but undefined concerns.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2018The NRA lied\u2019\n\nMaria Butina walks with Alexander Torshin then a member of the Russian upper house of parliament in Moscow, Russia.

NRA leaders were told the trip was needed to prove Torshin\u2019s American connections to the Kremlin, and that building relationships with Russians was \u2018NRA business.\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, the committee\u2019s Republican majority staff released their own report, as well. \u201cThis Majority finds no wrongdoing by the NRA or its officials that would reasonably call into question the NRA\u2019s tax-exempt status, based on the documents provided to the Committee,\u201d it said.\n\nDays later, though, Wyden and Schumer wrote their letter to the IRS commissioner, Charles Rettig, asking him audit the NRA\u2019s tax-exempt status, based on the conclusions of the minority report.\n\nThe report \u201craises concerns about potential private inurement and use of exempt resources for non-exempt activities,\u201d the letter said. \u201cEvidence in the report confirms that some members of the NRA delegation participated in the Moscow trip primarily or solely for the purpose of advancing personal business interests, rather than advancing the NRA\u2019s tax-exempt purpose.\u201d\n\n\u2018Yet another politically motivated investigation into the NRA\u2019\n\nSenator Grassley urged the IRS to be not be politicized.
