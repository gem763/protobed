(Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nAt the Democratic-primary debate in Houston last night, Beto O\u2019Rourke formally killed off one of the gun-control movement\u2019s favorite taunts: The famous \u201cNobody is coming for your guns, wingnut.\u201d Asked bluntly whether he was proposing confiscation, O\u2019Rourke abandoned the disingenuous euphemisms that have hitherto marked his descent into extremism, and confirmed as plainly as can be that he was. \u201cHell yes,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to take your AR-15.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan has been endorsed in full by Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, and is now insinuating its way into the manifestos of gun-control groups nationwide. Presumably, this was O\u2019Rourke\u2019s intention. But he \u2014 and his party \u2014 would do well to remember that there is a vast gap between the one-upmanship and playacting that is de rigueur during primary season, and the harsh reality on the ground. Prohibition has never been well received in America, and guns have proven no exception to that rule. In New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey, attempts at the confiscation of \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines and the registration of \u201cassault weapons\u201d have both fallen embarrassingly flat \u2014 to the point that the police have simply refused to aid enforcement or to prosecute the dissenters. Does Beto, who must know this, expect the result to be different in Texas, Wyoming, or Florida? Earlier this week, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives was unable to marshal enough votes to pass a ban on the sale of \u201cassault weapons\u201d \u2014 let alone to mount a confiscation drive. Sorry, Robert Francis. That dog ain\u2019t gonna hunt.\n\nAnd nor should it, for O\u2019Rourke\u2019s policy is spectacularly unconstitutional. The AR-15 is the most popular rifle in America by a considerable margin, and is therefore clearly protected by the \u201cin common use\u201d standard that was laid out in D.C. v. Heller. Put as baldly as possible, confiscation is not a program that the federal government is permitted to adopt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is also a disaster on its own merits. Much has been made of the fact that an attempt to round up millions of guns would obviously be met with widespread non-compliance. Much has been made, too, of the fact that this is an odd target for a country-dividing panic, given that rifles of all types are used less frequently in murder than hands and fists, than handguns, and than knives. Less, however, has been made of the fact that such an attempt can not even be squared with characterizations of American life that O\u2019Rourke, Booker, and Harris are themselves fond of making. If the trio\u2019s testimony is to be believed, America is a deeply unequal place in which minorities and the poor bear the brunt of draconian legislation while wealthier and better-connected people romp scot free \u2014 which, if true, would lead one to expect a little less bravado in defense of what would be the most significant federal crackdown since the start of the War on Drugs than a self-congratulatory \u201cHell yes.\u201d Such are the perils of making policy by T-shirt slogan.\n\nFor years, advocates of the right to keep and bear arms have suspected that confiscation was the endgame but have been rebuffed as paranoiacs in the press. Such a rebuffing is no longer possible. If it ever was, \u201cNobody is coming for your guns!\u201d is no longer true \u2014 which means that a host of commonly posed inquiries now have the same simple answer. \u201cWhy do you oppose federal licensing?\u201d Because leading Democrats are threatening confiscation. \u201cWhy do you oppose \u2018universal\u2019 background checks?\u201d Because they would create a registry. \u201cAnd why do you oppose a registry?\u201d Because leading Democrats are threatening confiscation. Unwittingly or not, O\u2019Rourke and his acolytes have stuck a dagger into the exquisitely calibrated gun-control messaging on which their party has worked for the better part of 20 years. No voter can now say he wasn\u2019t warned.", "description": "Beto O\u2019Rourke has stuck a dagger into the exquisitely calibrated gun-control messaging on which his party has worked for the better part of 20 years.", "authors": ["The Editors", "Andrew C.
