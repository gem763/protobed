The Queensland Racing Integrity Commission will oversee the probe, and a separate investigation conducted by Biosecurity Queensland was launched on Friday after the ABC program aired.\n\nWhile slaughtering racehorses is not illegal in the state of Queensland, it is in New South Wales, and the ABC report revealed some horses were illicitly transported across state lines to be butchered instead of rehomed in accordance with state law. The horses\u2019 identities were traced using their branding and microchips, and cross-referencing with race records revealed they had won a total of $5 million in prize money for their owners before they were sent to the slaughterhouse. Horse racing in Australia is a $1 billion industry, and some 14,000 foals are born into it each year.\n\nFrom Meramist, the meat is shipped to Europe and Asia for human consumption and processed into animal food - some of which is fed, ironically, to racing greyhounds. The meat is also supplied to kennels and pet shops.\n\nAlso on rt.com Australian media stages front-page \u2018blackout\u2019 to protest against govt clampdown on press freedom\n\nAustralian racing authorities insist that just 0.4 to 1 percent of the 8,500 horses retired from racing each year are slaughtered, but state regulators admitted to ABC they are unable to keep up even with the national rule requiring them to trace every horse from birth to retirement - and they aren\u2019t required to track them after that.\n\nThat needs to change, Racing Queensland chief executive Brendan Parnell told the Telegraph. \u201cA national horse traceability program is critical\u201d - including \u201ca system to track horse movement\u201d once they retire.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
