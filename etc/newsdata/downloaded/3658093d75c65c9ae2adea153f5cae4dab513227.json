We need to.\"\n\nAMAZON SPOKESMAN BLASTED OVER ATTACKS AGAINST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S PATRIOTISM\n\nIce shelves float out on the ocean at the edges of land-based ice sheets, according to scientists, and about 75 percent of the Antarctic continent is surrounded by these extensions of the sheet.\n\nThe shelves can be hemmed in by bumps and walls in the ocean floor. When restrained, the ice shelves slow down the flow of ice from the interior of the continent toward the ocean.\n\nHowever, if an ice shelf retreats or breaks apart, ice on land flows much more quickly into the ocean, increasing rates of sea-level rise.\n\nFIRST EVER DIAMOND WITHIN A DIAMOND FOUND IN RUSSIA IS SAID TO BE 800-MILLION-YEARS-OLD\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Upside-down \"rivers\" of warm ocean water are attacking the edges of Antarctic ice shelves from below, creating conditions that lead to break-ups and sea-level rise, according to scientists.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/antarctica-ice-shelf-pic-NASA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
