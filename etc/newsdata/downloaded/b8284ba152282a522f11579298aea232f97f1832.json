Weiss pulled out of a new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie trilogy and HBO reportedly declined to pick up a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d spinoff series.\n\nLate Monday, Benioff and Weiss, who launched the massively popular and award-winning \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on HBO in 2011, said they have walked away from plans with Walt Disney Co.

A pilot for the series had been shot, but reportedly needed extensive post-production work. HBO has reportedly green-lighted another \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d spinoff, this one set about 300 years before the events of the TV show.\n\nBenioff and Weiss signed a development deal with Netflix Inc. NFLX, -0.23% in August that\u2019s reportedly worth up to $300 million. They said that in the wake of that deal, there simply wasn\u2019t enough time to do \u201cStar Wars\u201d as well.\n\n\u201cThere are only so many hours in the day, and we felt we could not do justice to both \u2018Star Wars\u2019 and our Netflix projects,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cSo we are regretfully stepping away.\u201d\n\nDisney\u2019s Lucasfilm left the door open for them to return one day. \u201cDavid Benioff and Dan Weiss are incredible storytellers,\u201d Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said in a statement Monday. \u201cWe hope to include them in the journey forward when they are able to step away from their busy schedule to focus on \u2018Star Wars.\u2019\u201d\n\nDisney still has a number of \u201cStar Wars\u201d projects in development, including the upcoming Disney+ series \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d the final installment of the Skywalker movie saga \u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\u201d in December, a Disney+ series starring Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and a separate film trilogy helmed by director Rian Johnson.", "description": "As if they fell under a curse from the red witch Melisandre, two major Hollywood tentpole projects have gone up in dust in recent days, as \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d...", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU269_beniof_ZG_20191029190100.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
