USA TODAY\n\nHow will this year's World Series play out? Using the Dynasty League Baseball online simulation, USA TODAY Sports' Steve Gardner and DLB designer Mike Cieslinski will pre-play each game to provide some insight into the key matchups and strategy fans can expect to see in the Fall Classic.\n\nGame 3: Houston Astros at Washington Nationals\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a World Series filled with ace starting pitchers, Anibal Sanchez proved he deserves to be mentioned in the same breath with Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander, Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg.\n\nSanchez limited the mighty Houston Astros offense to one run and three hits over 7\u2153 innings as the Washington Nationals rolled to a 4-1 victory in Game 3 of USA TODAY's annual Simulated World Series.\n\nSanchez wasn't overly dominant, striking out only five Astros hitters, but he never got into any serious trouble the entire game \u2014 yielding only a solo home run to Carlos Correa before being lifted with one out in the eighth.\n\nBOX SCORE: Nationals 4, Astros 1\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY: Sanchez, two relievers silence Astros' bats\n\nThe Nationals broke a scoreless tie in the third inning against Houston starter Zack Greinke when right fielder Josh Reddick misplayed Trea Turner's line drive into a three-base error that allowed Sanchez to score from first base.\n\nJuan Soto plated the Nats' second run with a one-out single that scored Turner.\n\nThe only other scoring in the game came on Victor Robles' two-out, two-run homer off Greinke in the bottom of the sixth.\n\nTo close things out, the Nationals relied on their two top relievers for 1\u2154 shutout innings. Lefty Sean Doolittle got the final two outs in the eighth and Daniel Hudson stuck out the side in the ninth to earn the save.\n\nA screenshot of Victor Robles' two-run home run in Game 3 of USA TODAY's Simulated World Series.

Since he doesn't have a high strikeout rate (7.3 K/9), limiting the damage opposing hitters do when they make contact is the key to his success.\n\nGreinke wasn't bad in the simulated game \u2014 his defense let him down with two unearned runs \u2014 but Sanchez was better.\n\n\u2014 No DH: The Astros didn't have rookie slugger Yordan Alvarez in the lineup for Game 3, but their offense doesn't suffer as much as a typical American League team would with Greinke in the lineup.\n\nAmong pitchers with at least 50 plate appearances, Greinke's .277 average led the majors \u2014 as did his three home runs and .596 slugging percentage. (The second-best slugging percentage by any pitcher with that many plate appearances was Colorado's German Marquez at .362.)\n\nGreinke went 0-for-2 in Sim Series Game 3, but he could be a factor in the real game.\n\n\u2014 Lift-off for Astros? Houston will have its best chance of the series to get its running game going with Sanchez paired up with catcher Kurt Suzuki. According to Dynasty League Baseball's 2019 player ratings, the Nationals' right-hander has a C+ grade for his pickoff move and a +4 rating (the worst a pitcher can have) in delivering the ball to the plate with runners on base.\n\nLikewise, Suzuki has a +3 rating for his throwing arm, having cut down only 10% of runners attempting to steal during the season. Look for the Astros to try to steal whenever they get a runner on first base in Game 3.\n\nSimulate your own World Series.
