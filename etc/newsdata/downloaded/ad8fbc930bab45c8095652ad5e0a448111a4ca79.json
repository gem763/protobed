An investigation published by Handelsblatt has shown that Georg Berger was never the victim of the Nazis his son had painted him as, but a wartime profiteer.\n\nRather than joining the Nazi party for careerist reasons after Hitler had seized power in 1933, as Berger claimed in an interview with S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung as recently as last September, Berger senior signed up for the National Socialist cause as early as 1931, and kept on paying his membership fee until 1944.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Georg Berger\u2019s Nazi party card from 1936 Photograph: Handelsblatt\n\nBerger\u2019s loyalty to the Nazi regime led Hitler to promote him to become a ministerial adviser in 1937, and later put in charge of Ankerbrot \u2013 Austria\u2019s largest bakery and a crucial wartime state asset \u2013 after its Jewish owners fled the country.\n\nWhen Georg Berger did run into conflict with the Nazi party, historical records suggest it was not because of his moral principles, but because he was accused of illegally hoarding groceries during wartime, and carrying out costly renovations at his Viennese villa, which had been confiscated from its Jewish owners.\n\nNo records of his supposed arrest or imprisonment at Dachau could be found, said S\u00f6nke Iwersen, who runs Handelsblatt\u2019s investigations team.\n\nOver the weekend, the Roland Berger foundation announced it would postpone its awards ceremony on Monday, after this year\u2019s recipients, the Polish human rights activist Adam Bodnar and a German anti-racism initiative, announced they would decline their prize in the light of the revelations.\n\nThe consultancy firm, which has 50 offices worldwide and announces itself on its website as \u201cthe only leading global consultancy firm with non-Anglo-Saxon roots\u201d, is the latest in a series of large German businesses that have recently revealed their founders\u2019 entanglement in the structures of the Nazi regime.\n\nIn March, one of Germany\u2019s richest families donated \u20ac9.7m of their fortune to charity after discovering their ancestor\u2019s antisemitism, avowed devotion to Adolf Hitler and use of slave labour during the second world war.\n\nThe Reimann family, whose JAB Holding Company owns a controlling stake in brands including Krispy Kreme and Dr Pepper, had themselves commissioned the historian who found that female slaves from Nazi-occupied eastern Europe were beaten and sexually abused at Reimann premises in Ludwigshafen, in the Rhineland.\n\nIn May, the heiress of the Bahlsen biscuit empire apologised for comments downplaying the hardship faced by people forced to work at the family business under Nazi rule.\n\n\u201cThis was before my time and we paid the forced labourers exactly as much as German workers and we treated them well,\u201d 25-year-old Verena Bahlsen, one of four children of the company owner, Werner Bahlsen, had told Bild.\n\nHistorians say that the approximately 200 forced labourers at the Hanover-based Bahlsen works, many of them women from occupied Ukraine, had to work in a \u201cracial hierarchy\u201d in often miserable conditions.\n\nBerger, 81, a central figure in Germany\u2019s economic postwar history, who advised the former chancellor Helmut Kohl on the privatisation of East Germany\u2019s state assets and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der on his economic reforms, has not questioned the researchers\u2019 findings. Instead, he announced that he has hired two respected historians, Michael Wolffsohn and S\u00f6nke Neitzel, to examine his family\u2019s history.\n\nHis version of his father\u2019s biography, he said in an interview with Handelsblatt, had been based on his father\u2019s own memories and those of relatives and friends. Accepting their version of events, Berger conceded, amounted to \u201cunintended self-deception\u201d.\n\n\u201cI want to know the truth \u2013 and then change the image of my father,\u201d he added.", "description": "Roland Berger held up his father, Georg, as a role model \u2013 but the real story is darker", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b56aee6b1115dcbc9fb366707dbffa67cbc08e3f/0_288_4207_2525/master/4207.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c8615f2e548bd52dd1a4bdeb58ff303a", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
