She wanted something the kids would get excited about and something with which they would be familiar.\n\nAnd then it came to her: Target.\n\nDramatic play, Yarber told \"GMA,\" is \"probably the most important part of early childhood,\" she said. \"It teaches problem-solving and social skills. I wanted to keep it fresh.\"\n\nTheresa Yarber\n\nThe kids, she said, love their play area. \"It's so funny to see them mimic their parents,\" she said. \"They push the shopping cart around and hold a cup of coffee.\"\n\nTheresa Yarber\n\nYarber shared photos of her Target-themed play area on a popular Facebook page for educators. It was then shared more than 7,000 times.\n\nYarber told \"GMA\" that play area Target is getting ready to close to make way for a pumpkin patch. But given how successful the theme was, she said, \"it will reopen next fall.\"", "description": "A preschool teacher set up a Target-themed play area.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190926targetareamain_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
