The union said it was paying a portion of his legal fees.\n\nKraus said there was \"absolutely no excuse\" for Jefferson's death and said she had every right to defend herself under Texas law.\n\n\"It makes sense she would have a gun if she felt threatened or if there was someone in the backyard,\" an emotional Kraus said, adding that her death had \"eroded the trust we have built with the community.\"\n\nJefferson's nephew Zion told police his aunt heard noises coming from outside and took her handgun from her purse, according to the warrant.\n\n\"Jefferson raised her handgun, pointed it toward the window, then Jefferson was shot and fell to the ground,\" the warrant recounted the nephew telling police, adding that his aunt yelled out in pain.\n\nFort Worth has called on independent experts to evaluate the police department's practices, policies and training following the shooting, Kraus said.
