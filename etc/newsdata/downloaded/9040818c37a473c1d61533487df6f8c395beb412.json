You all fought so hard to make Thomas Cook a success. Secondly, I would like to say sorry to all our customers, those who are on holiday with us now, and those who have booked with us in the coming months.\u201d\n\nRui Vieira/AP\n\nThe U.K. government announced that there were over 150,000 people who were scheduled to return to Britain over the next two weeks. A joint operation between the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority and the government has been launched, codenamed Operation Matterhorn, which has seen dozens of chartered planes hired to return customers home free of charge from Monday.\n\nThe Transport Secretary, lawmaker Grant Shapps, said that Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse was \u201cvery sad news for staff and holidaymakers.\u201d\n\nDavid Arquimbau Sintes/EPA/via Shutterstock\n\n\u201cBut the task is enormous, the biggest peacetime repatriation in U.K. history,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cSo, there are bound to be problems and delays. Please try to be understanding with the staff who are trying to assist in what is likely to be a very difficult time for them as well.\u201d\n\nThe total cost of Operation Matterhorn is expected to reach $124 million, roughly double the cost of the last major repatriation involving a collapsing travel business, when Monarch Airlines ceased trading in 2017.\n\nThe government said that Thomas Cook\u2019s financial problems were \u201csubstantial, long-standing and well documented,\u201d and financial assistance would not have been enough to keep the company afloat. The BBC report that the government were asked to bail out the company with $310,000,000, which they refused.", "description": "Over 500,000 European passengers have been left stranded after Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel company, collapsed on Monday morning.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/thomas-cook1-ap-ml-190923_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
