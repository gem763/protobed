One man fidgets with a 3D puzzle; a woman, eyes closed, grips the chair arms. In the chairs, facing a Rorschach-esque painting, the couples seem aware of, if not reacting to, a discreetly installed camera \u2013 one woman\u2019s attempt to tuck in her partner\u2019s shirt tag, met with a shrug and rebuff, morphs into a shoulder rub. But the anticipation seems to cut through any self-consciousness, landing back on the two people \u2013 their unit, about to be picked as if an archaeology dig. One couple sits down, sighs, and looks at each other, as if to say: are you ready?\n\nJawline: behind the social media documentary about short-lived fame Read more\n\nShowtime\u2019s new series Couples Therapy is, like a good apology, exactly as advertised: a peek into the process of couples therapy, a seat in the room as they unpack years of coiled narratives and resentments to find common ground. The footage is intensely personal, at times searingly intimate, and cumulative \u2013 show-runners Josh Kriegman, Elyse Steinberg, and Eli Despres filmed four couples over 20 weeks of one-hour therapy sessions, then edited down and stitched together each couple\u2019s journey into nine half-hour episodes. Other than brief transition montages or characterizing shots \u2013 couple pouring coffee in their home, couple riding in the back of a car \u2013 that\u2019s it: the couples and the therapist, outfits changing with the week, getting to know each other and themselves.\n\nA decently clear picture \u2013 or, at least, the small-talk version of why each pair no longer sees eye-to-eye \u2013 emerges by the end of the first episode. There\u2019s Evelyn and Alan, a young couple whose mutual lack of trust perches them on separate ends of the couch and the brink of separation; Lauren and Sarah, a queer and trans couple whose spark dampens under the weight (or lack thereof) of potential children; DeSean and Elaine, a union of reserve and fire \u2013 \u201che calmed my noise, and I woke him up,\u201d Elaine says \u2013 now speaking in mutual spite; and Annie and Mau, whose bickering over a birthday plan gone awry suggests a personal history of defensiveness and desire much more complicated than either let on.\n\nThe subsequent episodes, four of which were available for review, richly fill in \u2013 or interrogate and flip \u2013 those narratives as the therapist, Dr Orna Guralnik, masterfully steers part-conversation, part investigation into the many strands of personality, miscommunication, sex, money, power and mistrust (to name a few things) that pull a couple apart. This raw, potentially instructive honesty builds on years of popular media seeking to pull back the curtain on romantic coupledom: there\u2019s the viral Ted Talk by therapist and media figure Esther Perel, Rethinking Infidelity, viewed nearly 14m times, and advice podcasts such as the Dan Savage Lovecast or Cheryl Strayed and Steve Almond\u2019s Dear Sugar. Perel has her own podcast, Where Should We Begin?, launched two years ago, in which audiences listen in on capsule episodes of single therapy sessions with real couples.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Orna Guralnik in Couples Therapy.

Its presence offers a level up on the fascination of lurking behind closed doors, but also presents a conundrum \u2013 \u201chow can you capture therapy, and what\u2019s so extraordinary about therapy, while also filming it?\u201d Kriegman, whose parents are both therapists, told the Guardian. \u201cIs it possible for people to be open and raw and vulnerable where they are able to do great work while also knowing that they\u2019re being filmed?\u201d\n\n\u201cTruthfully, we didn\u2019t know if it would work,\u201d he admitted. (He and Steinberg previously worked together on Weiner, a documentary about former Congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s scandal-derailed NYC mayoral campaign.) Nevertheless, the team set about casting a diverse range of couples \u2013 in age, sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity \u2013 open to exploring their relationship on record. Their open call, according to Steinberg, received over 1,000 inquiries. After a series of \u201clong conversations\u201d, they narrowed it down to a few couples, then eventually four.\n\nAll agreed to have cameras in their sessions because they were \u201cinspired by the possibility that sharing their stories publicly could be helpful to other people who are having similar struggles\u201d, said Kreigman. In turn, the film-making team, according to Steinberg, sought to avoid sensationalism or salaciousness by eliding the camera\u2019s presence as much as possible: the documentarians stayed out of the therapy room, instead concealing cameras, integrated inconspicuously into the office\u2019s design, behind one-way glass. They maintain that the recorded emotion is all unprompted; couples were able \u201cto come in, sit in the waiting room, have an hour-long therapy session, leave and never once interact with any element of production or camera-person, or see any camera\u201d, said Kriegman.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alan Ameerullah and Evelyn Ameerullah in Couples Therapy.

A New York City-based psychotherapist and psychoanalyst with 25 years experience, Gurnalik was initially skeptical of appearing on screen, but came around to the film-makers\u2019 vision of unadulterated process. \u201cThere are very parallel processes to documentary film-making and the psychoanalytic process \u2013 the process of storytelling, narrating, finding the underlying narrative of something that seems obvious,\u201d she told the Guardian.\n\nA former film student, Guralnik approaches couple\u2019s therapy with what she called a \u201cpsychoanalytic sensibility\u201d \u2013 keeping an ear to the \u201cenigmatic unconscious\u201d, knowing that \u201cpeople don\u2019t always know what\u2019s motivating them and what\u2019s at play\u201d \u2013 while also noting \u201cthe system that they\u2019ve created together\u201d with its own individual and family patterns. Guralnik also \u2013 in accordance, she said, with Kriegman and Steinberg \u2013 pays particular attention to sociocultural factors: gender dynamics, politics, race, class, \u201call of these large-scale issues and how they find expression within the couple\u2019s life, and their most intimate moments\u201d.\n\nCaptured softly on tape, Guralnik\u2019s work offers a welcome opportunity to witness the struggle of seeing another person for who they are \u2013 of recognizing, as she tells her own clinical advisor-cum-work therapist, that a single person will never live up to your fantasy of them. The show, she hopes, will help people \u201cto think about the kind of couple\u2019s dances that we all do \u2013 that we get into repetitive cycles.\u201d\n\nThose cycles work on a societal level, as well \u2013 a national pattern of outrage not lost on the film-makers. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that our culture right now, we\u2019re inundated with stories of conflict and polarization,\u201d said Kriegman. \u201cBut even beyond politics, I think many of us experience the dominant narrative being one of people entrenched in their corners with opposing views and digging their heels in.\u201d\n\nThe contested terrain of the romantic couple offers a different story, he said, one that evinces humanity oft-underplayed instinct to sincerely improve. \u201cPeople really do want to do better \u2013 they want to transcend, they want to grow, there\u2019s this underlying push toward health, connectedness, betterment,\u201d Guralnik said. \u201cI really feel as a therapist and an analyst, you get to tap into the underlying forces that mend humanity.\u201d", "description": "The showrunners behind an honest, if uncomfortable, new series explain how they got four couples to allow cameras in the room with their therapist", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c75ccf9340898918f7baa8963fa0fa72b4f46cae/683_0_7005_4204/master/7005.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f36151ff1f1bb935ceb18afafdc8531f"}
