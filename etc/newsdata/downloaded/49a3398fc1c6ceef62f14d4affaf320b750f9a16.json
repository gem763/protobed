It refrained from recommending an overhaul after its first review in 2014, but at that time rules had not been properly tested.\n\nThe outcome may be different now as Germany, the bloc\u2019s traditional economic motor, is on the brink of recession with officials in Berlin openly suggesting they could pump money into the economy to counter any significant slowdown.\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nOn Monday, Reuters reported that Germany is considering setting up independent public agencies that could take on new debt to invest in the country\u2019s flagging economy, without falling foul of strict national spending rules.\n\nItaly\u2019s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte repeated on Tuesday Rome will seek a reform of fiscal rules to promote growth.\n\nLast year, the European Fiscal Board, an EU body that advises on budget rules, said fiscal regulations that require euro zone states to keep deficits below 3% of output and gradually bring debts below 60% were too complex.\n\nIt proposed that countries which maintain their primary expenditure below a set ceiling over a three-year period - and therefore are set to lower their debt - could be considered in line with EU rules even if they run excess deficits.\n\nCommission officials confirmed the timeline for the review but do not comment on its possible outcomes, as the new executive is still waiting the vetting of EU lawmakers before beginning its mandate in November.\n\nThe Finnish document also makes clear that EU countries are still divided over the assessment of existing rules.\n\nAppointments of top economic commissioners unveiled on Tuesday confirmed this interlocutory approach.\n\nGentiloni\u2019s appointment came as a surprise to those who seek more fiscal discipline, as contrasts over budget rules with Rome have loomed large during the five-year mandate of the outgoing commission.\n\n\u201cThe fact that an Italian is put in charge of fiscal surveillance of Italy\u2019s budgetary mess is less than ideal,\u201d said Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker which sits in the economic committee of the EU parliament.\n\nBut in a carefully thought balancing act, von der Leyen has however confirmed at the helm of the executive\u2019s economic policy former Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, who has a reputation as a tough enforcer of fiscal discipline.", "description": "The European Union is bracing for a review of its strict fiscal rules as the bloc's economy slows, while monetary stimulus is seen as being close to its limits, according to an EU document and officials.", "authors": ["Francesco Guarascio", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
