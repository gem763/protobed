However, while the headline number looked good, the details showed that 15,500 full-time jobs had been lost and the gains were entirely in the part-time category.\n\nAdd to this a rise in the to 5.3%, which can partly be explained by an uptick in the participation rate to 66.2% from 66.1%, and the Australian dollar came under selling pressure across the board.\n\nfell to an intra-day low of 0.6789 versus the US dollar after the data, the lowest level since September 4, and slid 0.1% to 73.46 versus the Japanese yen. AUD/USD has now fallen for two consecutive days and has tested the 50% retracement of the September 3-12 rally at 0.6791. AUD/USD is now at 0.6797.\n\nDaily Chart\n\nAUD/USD Daily Chart\n\nBank of Japan doesn\u2019t join the easing party\n\nIn its rate setting meeting today, the Bank of Japan maintained its Interest Rate on Excess Reserves (IOER) unchanged at -0.1% and kept its current policy framework of \u201cQQE with yield control\u201d with asset purchases of 80 trillion yen per year. BOJ Governor Kuroda is scheduled to hold his press conference at 0600GMT.\n\nis down 0.26% at 108.15 after testing the 100-day moving average support at 107.99.\n\nDaily Chart\n\nUSD/JPY Daily Chart\n\nFed\u2019s rate expectations disappoint\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve delivered the 25 bps rate cut the markets had wanted, the outlook wasn\u2019t as dovish as the market had hoped. The members\u2019 dot plots didn\u2019t show any predictions below 1.5%, implying there could only be one more cut sometime during this theoretical cycle. The tone of Powell\u2019s statement was bullish on the economy, but suggested that this cut was yet another \u201cinsurance\u201d cut given the external headwinds that are building.\n\nCurrent market pricing implies only a 48% chance of a rate cut by year end, either at the October or November meetings, and the US dollar perked up after the Fed\u2019s announcement, with the Dollar Index, a measure of the dollar\u2019s value against six major currencies, rising 0.6% yesterday.\n\nBank of England stifled by Brexit\n\nThe Bank of England is another central bank to announce today, but is unlikely to join the easing party. The bank is expected to remain on hold until the Brexit deadline on October 31 has passed, and a clearer picture of its impact on the economy may emerge. Ahead of the rate announcement, retail sales data for August will be published and are expected to show a flat reading month-on-month.\n\nThe US calendar features existing home sales for last month, with a 0.4% decline expected, along with the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey for September. That\u2019s seen sliding to 11.0 from 16.8.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Forex Analysis by MarketPulse (Andrew Robinson) covering: USD/JPY, AUD/USD.
