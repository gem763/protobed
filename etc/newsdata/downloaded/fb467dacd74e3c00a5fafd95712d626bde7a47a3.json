Winning is addictive, and Lowry is dead-set on defending the Larry O\u2019B.\n\nStory continues\n\nkyle lowry on his goals for the 2019-20 season: \u201canother championship. you get a little taste of it you want to continue to feel that feeling.\u201d \u2014 Yahoo Sports Canada (@YahooCASports) September 28, 2019\n\nThere is a notion that the Raptors haven\u2019t earned the respect that most defending champions usually gain. Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green left in free agency and most analysts believe that the reigning Finals MVP\u2019s departure rules out the Raptors\u2019 viability of defending the title.\n\nLowry couldn\u2019t care less.\n\nkyle lowry on people not showing the raptors proper respect as champs: \u201cwe know what we\u2019ve accomplished. who cares what other people think.\u201d \u2014 Yahoo Sports Canada (@YahooCASports) September 28, 2019\n\nLowry is at the latter end of his career. With a championship in tow and his legacy with the franchise secure, all he needs is one last contract with the Raptors as the club looks forward to a new, defining chapter.\n\nMore Raptors coverage from Yahoo Sports", "description": "Toronto Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry appears to be inching closer to staying with the club past the 2019-20 season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EkUSefrLMBb9liazszFSKg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02OTkuNzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UWjA1ZuIsJ.yNjVDhQiJxw--~B/aD03Njg7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/d705b3a0-e210-11e9-b6ff-1dc3c5e60cd5", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
