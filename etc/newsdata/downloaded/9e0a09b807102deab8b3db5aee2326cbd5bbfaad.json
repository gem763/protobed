They were right. The community of Bridgeview, Illinois was the subject of one of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's largest domestic counter-terrorism probes in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n\n\nThe massive scale of the surveillance is detailed by Assia Boundaoui, a journalist who grew up in Bridgeview, in a newly released film called \"The Feeling of Being Watched\". In it, Boundaoui details her efforts to obtain the 33,000 documents the FBI produced during their investigation, which was codenamed \"Operation Vulgar Betrayal.\" She ends up successfully suing the US government for the files.\n\n\n\nThough it spanned 10 years and cost millions of dollars, \"Vulgar Betrayal\" yielded no terrorism-related convictions. Officials deny that the operation involved ethnic profiling. But critics say Bridgeview is just another example of the FBI's systemic use of surveillance to intimidate communities of color.\n\n\n\nVulgar Betrayal officially shut down more than a decade ago, but the operation has had a lasting impact on the people of Bridgeview, who continue to suffer from fear, paranoia and self-censorship.\n\n\n\nIn this episode we ask, Is the US government unfairly spying on Arab Americans? Join the conversation.\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Feeling of Being Watched - PBS\n\nHow One American Muslim Woman's Instinct Led to the Uncovering One of the Largest FBI Probes in U.S. History - ColorLines\n\nHow one filmmaker is using artificial intelligence to uncover surveillance of her Muslim community in Chicago \u2013 The Chicago Reporter\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?
