There\u2019s a complaint by someone in the intelligence community that President Trump made some inappropriate promise to a foreign leader over a series of communications. So just how bizarre is this scenario and how is the whistleblower process supposed to work?\n\nWelcome to Rabbit Hole.\n\nUntrodden territory: The whistleblowing process to report intelligence community employee concerns to Congress is used anywhere from four to 20 times a year, according to official reports. From what little we can tell from those reports, the intelligence community has never faced an issue remotely like the one raised by a complaint against Trump. The complaint, first filed on Aug. 12, reportedly involves Trump asking Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son.", "description": "The whistleblowing process Congress set up for the intelligence community has been used up to 20 times a year, according to official reports.
