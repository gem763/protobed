These folks are incredibly self-aware and accepting of their earthly fate; but \"Lark,\" from the forthcoming All Mirrors, expands to the metaphysical, where dreams can separate us from reality.\n\nJherek Bischoff \u2014 a composer who pulls at the edges of orchestral music, who arranges \"Lark\" here \u2014 seems to take a page from Scott Walker. Think of the disembodied strings found on Scott 3 or even on the spare Scott 4, where the slow-motion arrangement bursts at the song's most rapturous moments. There's a tenderness in the torrent, an empathy wrung out in a sublime cascade of sound.\n\n\"Dream on, dream on,\" Olsen repeats like a mantra to herself, like an admonition to someone who can't love every single part of someone who lives partly through dreams.\n\nAll Mirrors comes out Oct. 4 via Jagjaguwar.", "description": "Angel Olsen has become a master of characters who ache to move forward, but are pulled to an ever-present past.", "authors": ["Lars Gotrich"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/11/angelolsen_wide-ce03b2afbea5c3ec09fa7bc47e3c5edfa968474d.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
