Very difficult moment but we need to keep going.\n\n\"To the fans, I feel sorry for them, massive effort to come to support us, that was massive. And now you can't find any word to console them.\n\n\"We are living in a tough moment. We were on the top, we were all together, and now when this type of moment arrives we need to stick and stay all together.\n\n\"It's not easy. I think in five-and-a-half years I think this is the first tough moment we are living. But in terms of qualification and in terms of position in the table this feeling that it's not so good is new for us as players and staff at the club.\n\n\"Now is the moment to be strong. We cannot underestimate the situation but the times are not so good, there's always a possibility to make it strong again.\"\n\nTottenham's first fixtures after the international break are a home clash with Watford , a Champions League tie with Red Star Belgrade, before a trip to league leaders Liverpool.", "description": "The Tottenham boss has endured a torrid week that saw his side thumped by Bayern Munich and lose to Brighton", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Pa", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466493.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brighton-and-Hove-Albion-v-Tottenham-Hotspur-Premier-League-AMEX-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
