Add Interest\n\nIn a report issued Friday, Britain's National Audit Office said additional shipping capacity chartered by the U.K. for sending goods across the English Channel might not be operational until the end of November \u2014 one month after the Oct. 31 deadline for Britain to leave the European Union. Of the more than 12,300 medicines licensed in the U.K., about 7,000 arrive from or via the EU, mostly across the Channel.\n\nMeg Hillier, who chairs a committee overseeing the audit office, called the findings \"deeply concerning.\" She said she had seen \"countless examples\" of the British government missing deadlines, but that this one was particularly striking.\n\n\"If the government gets this wrong, it could have the gravest of consequences,\" she said.\n\nAlan Boyd of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges said people with epilepsy were a particular concern in the event of any drug shortages, noting that \"one seizure can have a life-changing impact.\"\n\nAccording to the British government's \" reasonable worst-case \" scenario, the flow of goods could be cut by half on Day One of a no-deal Brexit and could take a year to recover. It said time was \"extremely limited\" if the shipping issues were to be resolved by the end of October.\n\nDr. David Nicholl, a neurologist who helped draft the U.K.'s no-deal Brexit planning and went public with his concerns this month, said he felt vindicated by the audit office report. He said during his work consulting for the government, there were fears about adequate supplies for treatments for conditions including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, diabetes and certain cancers including leukemia.\n\n\"It's incredibly troubling and reckless,\" he said. \"I don't think there's any evidence that we're in any better situation than we were before.\"\n\nNicholl said British politicians were still refusing to honestly acknowledge the harm that would be caused to patients in Britain by a no-deal exit. He predicted there would be a spike in illness and deaths if Britain does leave Europe without a divorce deal.\n\nIn early September, Nicholl publicly raised the issue of drug shortages on a London radio show when he pointedly asked Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, what level of excess deaths he would be willing to accept in a no-deal Brexit. Mogg dismissed Nicholl's warnings and later compared him to the disgraced researcher Andrew Wakefield, who published a now-discredited paper linking a childhood vaccine to autism. Mogg later apologized for the comparison.\n\nNicholl said he was so disillusioned with the lack of action to address his concerns that he has decided to enter politics; he will stand as a candidate for the Liberal Democrats in a district currently held by Sajid Javid, the Conservative chancellor.\n\n\"I do not believe for one minute that anyone who voted to leave in 2016 voted to harm themselves and other people, and yet that is where we're heading,\" he said. \"We need some people in Parliament with a brain who are willing to negotiate with other people.\"\n\nBritain's department of health said it has taken measures to prepare for a no-deal departure, including ordering six weeks of extra medicine stocks and securing specialist courier services to deliver products with a short shelf life.\n\nBut not everyone was convinced by the moves.\n\n\"One thing is clear about a no-deal Brexit and that is that no amount of preparation can fully eradicate the risks it presents to patient safety,\" said Donal O'Donoghue of the Royal College of Physicians . \"It is impossible for me and my colleagues to reassure patients that their health and care won't be negatively impacted by the U.K. leaving the EU without a deal.\"\n\nSteve Bates, CEO of U.K.' s Bioindustry Association , said that unlike the last Brexit deadline \u2014 March 31 \u2014 the government has given companies much less information about alternative routes in case a no-deal Brexit results in jammed ports.\n\n\"Last time, we knew which ferry services had been commissioned on alternative routes with pharmaceutical companies encouraged to book space to ship their products,\" he told reporters last week. \"But the same approach has not been adopted this time.\"\n\nThe audit report released Friday also said there was \"incomplete information\" about the levels of medicine stockpiling but that levels were increasingly daily. As of Sept. 20, suppliers reported that 72% of medicines had a six-week stockpile.\n\nBoyd said drug shortages already happen every month even without Brexit and the department of health typically issues a list of affected medicines and in some cases, suggests possible alternatives. He said the group was also concerned that a no-deal Brexit would mean that Britain would be kicked out of a Europe-wide program to identify counterfeit medicines.\n\n\"The department of health will put its own system in place, but that will likely take a few years before it's up and running,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP's full coverage of Brexit and British politics at: https://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the chancellor's last name is Javid, not David.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
