As I found out during my time in the tent, semi-finals are a funny thing; it\u2019s an achievement in itself to get there yet leaving in a semi-final is also bittersweet. Emotions are everywhere and we question what you could\u2019ve done better to stay.\n\nIt\u2019s like going to Disneyland, having the time of your life looking forward to the final and best ride when suddenly there\u2019s a power outage resulting in the park being evacuated and closed for the day \u2013 just picture that!\n\nIt was disappointing not to reach the final stage, but I was also grateful I\u2019d come so far. It\u2019s difficult to let the tent go after nine intense weeks; for it to suddenly stop is bizarre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s almost like you know when it\u2019s your time to leave the tent \u2013 in my case I kind of knew and felt it. I was the weakest link and made far too many mistakes.\n\nI recall the morning of the semis fondly, thinking this was it, so close yet so far. I woke up at 6:30 and listened to The Life of Pablo album, track two \u2013 Father Stretch My Hands Pt.1 \u2013 by Kanye West. It became a morning ritual to listen to that album, starting with that track in particular, during the entire series.\n\nEvery morning in my hotel room before we all met for breakfast, I\u2019d put on my noise cancelling headphones, gather my thoughts and plan the day and how to tackle each challenge.\n\nThere was something spiritual/religious about that song. Unfortunately, the miracle ended for me that week but I always look on the bright side. I took from the show lessons and great experiences from the auditions all the way up to my elimination.\n\nFor me it was not goodbye because I knew I\u2019d be back for the epic garden party and to see all the bakers again and meet their families. And I knew there would also be food and drinks \u2013 HALLELUJAH!!!\n\nIt\u2019s almost like you know when it\u2019s your time to leave the tent (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nBake Off is filmed over the summer but doesn\u2019t air until the autumn, which makes it tricky to keep such big news quiet! Close friends and family knew I was taking part and swore under secrecy not to tell anyone, but I couldn\u2019t share major details with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s quite funny watching your summer on Bake Off play out over several weeks on national television. Online comments and opinions (the irony of this column isn\u2019t lost on me\u2026) formed a slightly odd narration and at the time I remember thinking that it felt like my summer had almost happened to someone else.\n\nWhile I was filming the show I was still in my day job and this didn\u2019t change after it aired. What did change was the social media intensity and following that grew pretty rapidly after the first few episodes.\n\nI was once even recognised in Peru whilst trekking in the middle of nowhere, and more recently in the middle of a lake in Switzerland by one other mad swimmer who had ventured out into the cold water! Fortunately for my colleagues I\u2019m still just Selasi who bakes cakes and that\u2019s really helped keep a sense of normalcy about the whole situation.\n\nHaving said that, I\u2019m extremely fortunate that Bake Off also opened up a lot of opportunities I wouldn\u2019t have been able to experience otherwise. I took a sabbatical and went to study at Culinary Arts Academy in Switzerland, an opportunity that came about as a direct result of Bake Off.\n\nIt meant I could study under professional chefs, spent an amazing week in Paris with Ritz Escoffier and gained a greater understanding of baking at a professional level for future ventures.\n\nI\u2019ve been able to host several pop-ups across London (my next one is being held at SMEG\u2019s HQ on the night of the lights switch-on in Regent\u2019s Street on 14th November) and most recently I\u2019ve spent two weeks serving afternoon tea at Duke\u2019s London, Mayfair alongside their amazing 3AA Rosette starred chef Nigel Mendham.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve got lots more projects in the pipeline that I can\u2019t talk about at the minute, but all that is to say that Bake Off changed my life in more ways than I could imagine.\n\nI was also extremely lucky that the people I shared the tent with were a lovely bunch and we would organise viewing parties as each week unfolded. To this day we\u2019re still in regular contact and see each other at various events.\n\nIt definitely made the overall experience much more enjoyable. I love them all and would not change the experience for anything. It was perfect.\n\nThis week was challenging and I\u2019m sure the bakers felt the pressure, but you know what, they pulled through and they all delivered. I hope that Rosie can take away as much enjoyment from her time in the tent as I did.\n\nThe judges are certainly ready for the final and I hope the bakers are too! While they\u2019re sat at home already knowing their fate, we\u2019ll have to wait one more week to find out.\n\nEither way, I hope they\u2019re all celebrating their success so far and the adventure that\u2019s just beginning for them.\n\nMORE: Choosing what to wear on GBBO is as stressful as planning your bakes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: When you have a Bake Off disaster, the GBBO tent is a lonely place\n\nMORE: GBBO\u2019s Nadiya Hussain admits upbringing made her \u2018hate being a woman\u2019 as she opens up on sexual abuse", "description": "Metro.co.uk's Bake Off correspondent, Selasi Gbormittah, reflects on being sent home in the semi-finals of the show.", "authors": ["Selasi Gbormittah", "Great British Bake Off Semi-Finalist"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/11854082-low_res-the-great-british-bake-off-2016_1571827825.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
