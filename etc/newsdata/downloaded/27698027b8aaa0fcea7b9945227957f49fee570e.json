July inflows also reached the highest level we\u2019ve seen in a single month, well above the previous high of USD 64.7 million raised in December 2017,\" the firm said, noting that the trust was closed to new investments throughout August and September.\n\nSource: Grayscale\n\nHowever, institutions have also showed more attention to altcoins.\n\nLooks like institutions are diversifying their crypto positions with @GrayscaleInvest: bought 2/3 #bitcoin, 1/3 \u201cal\u2026 https://t.co/DBNtRTbh5l \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske)\n\nMeanwhile, U.S.-based financial derivatives giant CME Group said that its Bitcoin futures contracts have seen a greater interest in this year\u2019s third quarter, but more specifically, it\u2019s the institutional interest that continues to grow, with \u201ca record number of large open interest [more than BTC 25] holders\u201d (LOIHs) .\n\nSource: CME Group\n\nOther results of Bitcoin futures on CME:\n\nThere\u2019s a strong institutional flow, with 454 new accounts added in the Q3 2018, compared to 231 a year ago.\n\nThe average daily volume of contracts traded was 5,534, which is up 10% compared to a year ago, and which is the equivalent of BTC 27,670 or USD 289 million.\n\nSource: Coindesk\n\nA couple of days before this statement, the company also said that the customer interest in CME Bitcoin futures remained strong during the third quarter, with daily open interest (OI) of over 4,600 contracts, which is up 61% compared to Q3 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, using the data provided by crypto market analysis firm Coin Metrics, crypto researcher and analyst Willy Woo came to a \u201csuper bullish\u201d conclusion that is bound to make a lot of people in the Cryptoverse happy or at least hopeful. He said that \u201cwe're likely in a new renaissance of Bitcoin,\u201d which is \u201cpowered by capital influx of high net worth investors,\u201d while it were the tech savvy people bootstrapping the network who were behind the early BTC renaissance.\n\nWoo was inspired to look back in time by a chart of address counts with BTC 1,000 or more posted by the on-chain market intelligence platform Glassnode, which shows a sharp rise in number of these addresses in the past year. Though some people also suggested that it could be an individual or an exchange moving a large amount of BTC to multiple wallets.\n\nWhatever the case is, Woo discovered during his analysis that \u201cthe rate of growth of 1000 BTC addresses now matches the early growth in Bitcoin's network.\u201d\n\nHe explained that while gaining BTC 1,000 \u201cwas a matter of being an uber geek\u201d when BTC was just born, at this point in its history, that same amount of Bitcoin means an investment of more than USD 8 million, says the trader, while the number of the world\u2019s ultra-high net worth individuals (those with more than USD 50 million) stands at around 150,000. \u201cIt strikes me that this population is probably in the same order of magnitude of people who had that the interest and know how to mine BTC pre-2013, producing similar growth patterns.\u201d\n\nI think of the incumbent capital as the billionaire+ scale, in which case BTC offers insufficient liquidity. BTC in its nature favours the little guy. \u2014 Willy Woo (@woonomic) 11 October 2019\n\nMeanwhile, just recently in an interview, the President of Fidelity Personal Investing (a unit of the U.S.-based mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments), Kathleen Murphy, said that the company - the CEO of which, Abigail Johnson, is a crypto fan - is being very careful about where it offers crypto, implying that the digital currencies carry heavier risks for retail investors than they do for institutional investors. While they\u2019ve embraced the crypto in a sense that they want to be innovative and thoughtful, says Murphy, \u201cwe want to be very careful about making sure that investors [\u2026] who really aren\u2019t institutional investors don\u2019t make a mistake with cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nAt pixel time (12:46 AM UTC), bitcoin trades at c. USD 8.318 and is almost unchanged in the past 24 hours. It's up by 1% in the past week.", "description": "Recently released data showed that large investors are becoming interested in the most popular cryptocurrency even more and are fueling \"a new renaissance of Bitcoin.\"", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5da/5c503b18bf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
