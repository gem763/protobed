Earlier on Tuesday, Russian military forces appeared in Manbij after the withdrawal of the estimated 100 American troops stationed in that town.\n\nA second U.S. official told ABC News the withdrawal of American troops and equipment in northeast Syria could take weeks. Most troops are expected to be withdrawn via aircraft. Equipment will be shipped out via air and by land.\n\nA third U.S. official told ABC News additional military forces will have to enter Syria in order to transport out the equipment. This includes transport vehicles and whatever forces are required for protection.\n\nAccording to the official, the U.S. has made contact with the Russian military, Kurdish forces and the Turkish military to ensure they're aware that the U.S. military troops in Syria are focused on a withdrawal.\n\nUnder the withdrawal plan authorized by President Donald Trump, a small contingent of U.S. military forces will remain at At Tanf Garrison, a military facility near the border with Jordan and Iraq.\n\nIn a statement issued on MondayTrump said the small force would remain to deal with remaining ISIS fighters, but U.S. officials have previously acknowledged the main purpose of the force at At Tanf is to check Iranian military weapons flows and advances into Syria.", "description": "The", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/f15-dvids-aa-191011_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
