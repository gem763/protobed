It also has no foreign transaction fees, so using this card is a great way to avoid extra charges when traveling abroad.\n\nRead more: If you only want to $450+ for one premium credit card, which should you choose?\n\nFree nights and credits at Marriott hotels\n\nEvery year after your account anniversary, you'll receive a free night award valid at properties charging up to 50,000 points per night. Depending on when you travel, that could get you a night at up to a Category 7 property (Marriott's second-highest tier of hotels).\n\nYou'll also receive a $300 credit every year valid for eligible purchases made directly at Marriott hotels, including room rates and incidentals. This benefit starts as soon as you open the card, so as long as you spend at least $300 per year at Marriott hotels, this alone offsets most of the card's annual fee.\n\nHolding the Bonvoy Brilliant card also gives you access to an exclusive rate for stays of two nights or more at The Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis hotels and resorts, which includes a $100 credit toward room service, spa treatments, and other qualifying purchases.\n\nRedeeming your Marriott Bonvoy points\n\nYou can redeem your Marriott Bonvoy points and free night rewards at over 7,000 participating Marriott Bonvoy hotels in cities around the world. Award nights start as low as 4,000 points per night, and if you use your points to book a night of 5 nights or more, you'll get the least expensive night for free. This discount is automatically calculated when you search for a stay of 5 or more nights on marriott.com.\n\nAdditionally, Marriott Bonvoy allows you to transform your points into frequent flyer miles with over 40 partner airlines \u2014 more than any other loyalty program. You'll receive 1,000 airline miles for every 3,000 miles transferred, with a 5,000 mile bonus for every 60,000 points (so 60,000 points becomes 25,000 airline miles). Transfers to United Airlines MileagePlus get an extra 10% bonus.\n\nMarriott Bonvoy elite status\n\nAs long as you are a Bonvoy Brilliant cardholder, you'll receive automatic Gold elite status in the Marriott Bonvoy program, which includes the following benefits:\n\n25% bonus points on stays at Marriott properties\n\nEnhanced room upgrades\n\nA welcome gift of 250 or 500 bonus points at check-in\n\nLate checkout, subject to availability\n\nComplimentary enhanced in-room internet access\n\nThe card also helps you climb toward higher levels of elite status, providing 15 qualifying nights every year just for having the card. You can also obtain complimentary Platinum elite status by spending $75,000 on the card in a calendar year.\n\nOther travel benefits\n\nPriority Pass Select\n\nSign up for complimentary access to Priority Pass' network of over 1,200 airport lounges in more than 120 countries.\n\nGlobal Entry/TSA PreCheck enrollment credit\n\nThe primary cardmember and each authorized user receives a credit toward enrollment in Global Entry ($100) or TSA PreCheck ($85), making your travel experience easier. This credit can be used once every five years (exact dates vary by program) so as long as you have the card you'll never have to pay to maintain your membership in these trusted traveler programs.\n\nRead more: Credit cards that will reimburse your Global Entry fee credit\n\nCar rental loss and damage insurance\n\nWhen you use your Bonvoy Brilliant card to reserve and pay for a car rental, you may be covered against loss or damage of the vehicle. This coverage is secondary, and does not provide liability insurance.\n\nBaggage Insurance Plan\n\nWhen you purchase a ticket on an airline or other common carrier with your Bonvoy Brilliant card, you'll be covered for eligible lost, damaged, or stolen baggage up to $3,000 per trip.\n\nTravel accident insurance\n\nIf the unthinkable happens to you or a loved one on a trip you booked with your Bonvoy Brilliant card, you'll be eligible for up to $500,000 in death and dismemberment insurance for you and each of your additional cardmembers, the spouse or domestic partner of each cardholder, and any of their children under age 23.\n\nPurchase protection\n\nThe Bonvoy Brilliant card offers a host of valuable benefits for purchases made with your card. If you try to return an item purchased with the card within 90 days of purchase and the merchant won't accept it, American Express provides coverage of up to $300 per purchase and $1000 per year.\n\nYour purchases are also covered against accidental damage or theft for 120 days, up to $10,000 per claim and up to $50,000 per account. And if you buy something with a manufacturer's warranty of less than 5 years, American Express will double it (up to 2 additional years), with the same dollar limits.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant card can be a great deal for frequent Marriott guests. The $450 annual fee may seem steep at first, but it's easily offset by the $300 annual credit and the annual free night award, before even considering the value of the elite status and other benefits received from the card.", "description": "The Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant packs in plenty of benefits, from an annual Marriott statement credits to complimentary elite status and bonus points.", "authors": ["Caroline Lupini"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9789e1528879128730d2ad?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
