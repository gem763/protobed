(\u201cSandfire America\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d TSX.V:SFR and OTCQB:SRAFF) is pleased to provide the following update related to progress at the Black Butte Copper underground project in Montana.\n\n\n\nPermitting Progress\n\nThe Montana Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the Department of Natural Resources & Conservation (MDNRC) recently informed the Company of a matter regarding the overlap between their respective areas of oversight. The Company has developed a robust plan to address this matter that is satisfactory and creates a pathway forward which includes further assurances on the water right modification application which has been in progress since early 2019. The Company is confident that it has addressed the agencies\u2019 concerns. In their fall update, the MDEQ stated, \u201cDEQ is in the final stages of its review and, barring unforeseen issues, anticipates publishing the Final EIS in the final quarter of 2019.\u201d\n\nCEO and VP of Project Development Rob Scargill stated, \u201cWhilst this short delay is frustrating to all concerned, we are confident that addressing these matters now will deliver a more robust operating permit and mining operation. The Company and our stakeholders continue to be committed to permitting and building a showcase underground copper mine in Meagher County.\u201d\n\nBankable Feasibility Study\n\nAll the technical studies have now been completed for the Black Butte Project Feasibility Study which commenced in October 2018. An updated Mineral Resource has been published and will be used as the foundation for the Feasibility Study. GR Engineering Services, SRK Consulting and others are completing documentation of the technical sections. The study will be finalized once the Final EIS is released to ensure that the designs and financial modelling are consistent with the permit requirements.\n\nFinancing\n\nFollowing a review of financing options by the Non-Executive Independent Directors, the Company has agreed to an unsecured loan facility with our majority shareholder, Sandfire Resources NL, to provide US$3 million to cover expenditures between now and the release of the Feasibility Study. The funds will be used for permitting, studies and preparatory work for pre-construction earthworks for the portal pad and environmental protection ponds. On release of the Feasibility Study, the Board will consider their mid-term and long-term financing options.\n\nBoard of Directors Update\n\nJason Grace joined the Company\u2019s Board of Directors on September 26, 2019 replacing Bruce Hooper.
