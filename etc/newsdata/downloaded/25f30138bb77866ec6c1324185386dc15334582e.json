I want to be in the Guinness Book of Records.\u201d\n\n(Image: Phil Harris/Daily Mirror)\n\nBoris admired Dante\u2019s electric wheelchair, asking: \u201cHow fast can you go in that? 21mph? Wow, that\u2019s incredible. And so are you. Keep on doing what you are doing \u2013 you are inspirational.\u201d\n\nNo10 aides looked relieved when Boris moved on, because when Dante had appeared on the Lorraine show earlier, he had shouted: \u201cStop Brexit , NOW!\u201d\n\nThe PM then spoke to Josh Littlejohn, founder of the Social Bite movement to end homelessness.\n\nJosh told him about The World\u2019s Big Sleep Out, which takes place in 52 countries in December and aims to raise \u00a340million.\n\nBoris told Josh he had slept on the streets twice for charity, once in a London churchyard and once in his constituency.\n\nBut, he added, surprisingly: \u201cWhen I was a teenager I did it quite a lot, mainly because I didn\u2019t have much money.\n\n\u201cThe tragedy of homelessness is a real scandal and we have to sort it out. What you are doing is fantastic.\u201d\n\n(Image: Phil Harris/Daily Mirror)\n\nBoris was also amazed \u2013 and enlightened \u2013 by Child of Courage Jaydee-Lee Dummett, seven, who saved her family\u2019s lives by raising the alarm when she noticed her brother Laylan, four, was disorientated, and spotted the red warning light on their carbon monoxide alarm.\n\n\u201cWhat is a carbon monoxide alarm?\u201d Boris asked. \u201cWhy on earth did you have one of those?\u201d\n\nWhen Jaydee-Lee\u2019s mum Lindy told him 50 people a year die from carbon monoxide poisoning and that every home should have one, he said: \u201cReally? I wouldn\u2019t have had the faintest idea.\u201d\n\nAfter the reception, Boris told the Mirror: \u201cIt has been an amazing privilege to hear their stories. They\u2019ve shown courage, determination and selflessness and, on behalf of the entire country, I say a big thank you.\u201d", "description": "The PM was bowled over by their stories, paying tribute to their inspirational spirit on behalf of the nation", "authors": ["Rachael Bletchly", "Image", "Phil Harris Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20751852.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_2019-Pride-of-Britain-Award-Winners-at-10-Downing-Street.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
