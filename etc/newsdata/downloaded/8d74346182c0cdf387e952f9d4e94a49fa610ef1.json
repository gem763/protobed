Mandatory Credit: Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSo the Saints (6-1) are in good shape regardless of whether Brees returns for a home game against the Arizona Cardinals (3-3-1) on Sunday.\n\nBrees is listed as questionable but coach Sean Payton didn\u2019t declare a starter after Friday\u2019s practice and said he would \u201cprobably wait until Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth (quarterbacks) got a lot of work this week,\u201d Payton told reporters before mentioning Brees was a limited participant. \u201cHe looked good. ... But we\u2019ll have a good plan.\u201d\n\nBrees returned to practice on a limited basis Wednesday and is hoping to play for the first time since a 27-9 road loss to the Los Angeles Rams in Week 2.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d Brees said.\n\nBrees said the only way he wouldn\u2019t start Sunday would be if during the course of the week the ball isn\u2019t coming out of his hand accurately or if he isn\u2019t \u201cconfident or comfortable.\u201d Payton was less definitive, and is willing to wait until game day if necessary.\n\nIf any developments lead to Brees not playing, he would have two more weeks to recover before the next game \u2014 at home against the Atlanta Falcons on Nov. 10 \u2014 because New Orleans has its bye next week.\n\n\u201cDrew is one of the best (to) ever play, and we understand that, but when you watch the film this year, Teddy\u2019s playing at an incredible level and Coach Payton has such great offensive creativity, finds great matchups, and they\u2019re rolling right along,\u201d Cardinals first-year coach Kliff Kingsbury said. \u201cWe know whichever guy it is, we\u2019re going to have our hands full as a defense.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a testament once again to that coaching staff, that organization, that you can have your backup quarterback come in and still play at such an incredible level.\u201d\n\nBridgewater said he\u2019s \u201cfocused on the process\u201d because \u201cthe process has been working for us.\u201d\n\nThe Saints hope to have leading rusher Alvin Kamara (ankle, knee) back on the field after he missed a 36-25 victory at Chicago last week. He is listed as questionable.\n\nStarting tight end Jared Cook (ankle) was ruled out on Friday. Receiver Tre\u2019Quan Smith (ankle) and cornerback Patrick Robinson (hamstring) will also miss the contest. Safety J.T. Gray (ankle) is questionable.\n\nLatavius Murray replaced Kamara against the Bears and finished with 119 yards and two touchdowns on 27 carries.\n\nThe Saints\u2019 defense has held each of the past four opponents to fewer than 260 yards.\n\nAs for the Cardinals, they have won three games in a row, and they too overcame the absence of a key offensive player in their last game. Former All-Pro running back David Johnson started against the Giants but barely played due to ankle and back injuries.\n\nHis replacement, Chase Edmonds, had career highs of 27 carries, 126 yards and three touchdowns in a 27-21 victory. His scoring runs covered 20, 20 and 22 yards.\n\nEdmonds could be the key to the running game this week because Johnson didn\u2019t practice all week and is listed as questionable. Edmonds\u2019 success eased the pressure on rookie quarterback Kyler Murray.\n\n\u201cWe were excited for Chase to get that opportunity and play at such a high level,\u201d Kingsbury said. \u201cHe has worked really hard the last two years to change his body and become an every-down back in this league.\n\n\u201cI think you saw the versatility, you saw what he can do in that role. We were all just proud of his effort. For him to have his opportunity and to take advantage of it like that meant a lot to all of us.\u201d\n\nThe Arizona defense \u2014 bolstered by the return of star cornerback Patrick Peterson from suspension \u2014 contributed significantly last week also, getting eight sacks and three takeaways.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The New Orleans Saints have done more than fine without Drew Brees, winning all five games that Teddy Bridgewater has started at quarterback since the 12-time Pro Bowler underwent thumb surgery.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1445009703&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1TB-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
