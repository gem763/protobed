There have been 425 homicides in Chicago so far this year.\n\nHe also said Chief Johnson is putting \"criminals and illegal aliens before the city of Chicago\" and that \"sanctuary\" cities are knowingly releasing jailed immigrants accused of violent crime.\n\nHis appeal to law enforcement arrived that morning after he was roundly booed during Game 5 of baseball\u2019s World Series in DC on Sunday, with fans of the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros chanting \u201cLock him up!\u201d as \u201cVeterans for Impeachment\u201d signs were held aloft by spectators, prompting the president to leave the stadium early.\n\nHis unwelcome appearance at the game followed what should have been a triumphant moment for his administration in the announcement of the death of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a US-led raid that saw the terror group leader cornered in a dead-end tunnel in Syria. The president assured the world the terrorist had died \u201ccrying and screaming\u201d.\n\nIn a Monday press conference, the president's Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mick Milley said he doesn't know where Mr Trump got that account of the operation.\n\nThe president shared a photo on Twitter of an Army Delta force dog that was critical in the operation, according to Mr Trump. The dog's name is still classified. General Milley said it returned to its military unit.\n\nWhen leading Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer demanded to know why Congress had not been briefed on the operation in advance at a time when the White House\u2019s approach to foreign policy is already under intense scrutiny, vice president Mike Pence squirmed and struggled to answer the question on Fox News.\n\nMr Trump later explained that the administration was going to notify Congress but \"we decided not to do that because Washington leaks like I\u2019ve never seen before. There\u2019s no country in the world that leaks like we do, and Washington is a leaking machine.\"\n\nFollow along as it happened below.", "description": "During a speech in Chicago to police brass from across the US, Donald Trump attacked the city's police chief who is boycotting the visit from the president, who used his address to law enforcement to blame so-called \"sanctuary\" cities for violent crime rates.Mr Trump accused Chicago Police", "authors": ["Joe Sommerlad", "Chris Riotta", "Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/L_jDLHaPDGrzK43eHapUqQ--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/fc062c2fdc7db9fbcfb65a91da4d761e", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
