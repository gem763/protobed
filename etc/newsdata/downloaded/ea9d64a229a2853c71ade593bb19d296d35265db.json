They didn\u2019t even call us,\u201d Doug Scott told the TV station. \u201cMarian didn\u2019t leave the house, go on the street and get this done on her own, no \u2014 she\u2019s 8 years old. We did this ourselves in our own home, and there\u2019s no way I felt like this would happen.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIncidents such as Scott\u2019s are part of a larger, ever-evolving debate over self-expression and bias in school dress codes, as well as the deep legacy of discriminatory attitudes toward natural hair in professional and academic settings.\n\nWendy Greene, a law professor at Washington and Lee School of Law who studies civil rights and discrimination, said dress code policies like the one at Scott\u2019s school aren\u2019t uncommon; Greene said the incidents can be \u201cstigmatizing\u201d and can even lead to long-term emotional effects in children when it comes to their self-image and self-esteem.\n\n\u201cWhat we find about black girls, especially in schools, is that they\u2019re subject to hyper-regulation; the [hairstyle] itself is perceived as not natural, and sometimes the color is not considered natural based on the skin tone of the individual,\u201d Greene said. Red hair, for instance, is, in fact, a natural shade \u2014 only for some people.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Paragon student handbook permits \u201cconservative\u201d hairstyles and prohibits any style it considers \u201cextreme,\u201d such as shaved heads, Mohawks and mullets. Last, it states that \u201chair color must be of natural tones.\u201d\n\nGreene served as the legal expert for legislation that became the CROWN Act (\u201cCreate a Respectful and Open Workplace for Natural Hair\u201d), which bans discrimination against natural hair. New York and California both have CROWN Acts on the books and are supposed to extend to public schools, as well. The laws are less clear when it comes to private or parochial schools, she notes.\n\n\u201cPrivate and charter schools have a broader right to be able to impose these grooming policies. There could be some restrictions or restraints based on state law or local ordinances,\u201d Greene said. \u201cIf that school is being federally funded in any way, they may be subject to federal civil rights laws.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGreene said she wasn\u2019t familiar with private or parochial schools that have changed their dress-code policies to be more inclusive.\n\n\u201cThere have been some instances where schools don\u2019t change policies at all, and they leave it up to the parents and children to decide if they want to continue at that particular institution,\u201d Greene said. She added that although there have been more examples in the news of incidents at private schools, that doesn\u2019t mean public schools necessarily have more inclusive dress codes. All schools, she suggested, could do better.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScott, Marian\u2019s father, told WILX, an NBC affiliate, that the family had no plans to go to a different school but simply wants better communication from the school should another such incident arise.\n\nNeither Scott nor Paragon Charter Academy\u2019s principal could be immediately reached for comment.\n\nWILX reported that Marian will return on picture-retake day with black hair.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "An expert said such incidents can be \u201cstigmatizing\u201d and can lead to long-term emotional effects in children when it comes to their self-esteem.", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EcS-JS7vUsoBEQDCk7b2R4WDyWE=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-08-2019/t_6f36fce707c048d68da5504bb779655f_name_20191008_Girl_school_pic_split.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
