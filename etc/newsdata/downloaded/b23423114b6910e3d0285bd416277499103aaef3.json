Because Lana, over time, hasn\u2019t really changed. She was right all along.\n\n\n\nOn Norman Fucking Rockwell, she eases in, stretches out, and continues to fill the artistic space she created for herself on Born to Die. A ground-shifting debut, her first album relocated Cat Power\u2019s arch attitude and indie-rock-with-samples approach to major-label pop. Though rarely successful on the radio, her distinctive music has acted, more powerfully, as a blanketing atmosphere\u2014summertime plus sadness\u2014anticipating the mood-based playlisting of the streaming era. Here, the overall vibe is swooning yet lonely, with ambling piano songs that allude to depressed American poets, living and dead, and a sprawled Laurel Canyon surf-folk that\u2019s beachy with a fog, so all the sounds swim. On the spectrum of her career, between elements of rap and rock, let\u2019s just say there's only one song with a drum machine.\n\nBut that opening title track, a swooning love song about a \"man-child,\" offers more than a sideways opportunity to point out Lana's uniquely enduring influence. The song and its sentiment are also, in a Joni Mitchell sort of way, deeply romantic, exemplary of her whole project. \"Why wait for the best,\" she sings later on the song, \"when I could have you?\" For an artist often associated with fantasy, how precisely Lana Del Rey understands real life! What is good has flaws.\n\nFive years ago, I did a FADER cover story around her second album, Ultraviolence\u2014an important reference point because, like Norman Fucking Rockwell, it was produced by a (male) rock veteran whose big-solo-loving musicianship complimented Lana's vision but in no way skewed her general project, because that\u2019s impossible. At the time, I asked her what she thought of ostensible feminist criticisms of her music, and she responded, famously, that she was more interested in space travel. Many saw her dismissal as grounds for derision, but I now believe she knew what she was doing. She gives herself the freedom to be herself, and doggedly. As a result, almost nothing she\u2019s done has ever felt forced.\n\nShe\u2019s covered Nina Simone twice and now just did\u2026 Sublime. That\u2019s iconic. There are 900 reasons someone big should have done a Sublime cover this year, but it feels like the only reason Lana did one is that she felt like it. At the same time, there\u2019s heft. A critic might easily read something transgressive into the fact that she\u2019s redoing a track which, in our nostalgic memories, is sunny and blissful yet, as she underscores simply by singing it, contains a fantasy of domestic violence: \"She\u2019s evil\u2026 I'd like to hold her head underwater.\" But what\u2019s great about Lana\u2019s music is, whether you\u2019re \"reading\" it or just listening, it's undeniably good.\n\nDoes anyone really believe that\u2019s the case on Taylor Swift\u2019s new album, when Taylor sings, \"If I was a man, I would be the man.\" God, let's hope not. Taylor is, perhaps, an exemplary CEO, but she pales as an artist: it's hard to imagine her summoning the combined mania and conviction that it takes to pull off so simple a self-reflexive line as \"Can\u2019t a girl just do the best she can?\" as Lana does on \"Mariners Apartment Complex.\" Consider another comparison. As someone rightly pointed out, Taylor decided to choose this particular moment to cast a Black love interest in her new music video\u2014coincidentally, at just the same time that Katy Perry cast a Black love interest for her new music video. Now, remember Lana, those many years ago, portraying Jackie O aside A$AP Rocky\u2019s President Kennedy? That was really only mildly bold, but it\u2019s powerful when you connect it to 2019 and her recent clip for \"Fuck It I Love You,\" where she\u2019s with the most beefcakeingest white bodybuilder, like Mr. Universe 1952. When you do things that nobody asks for, you can just do things.\n\nIt\u2019s by passing through romance that Lana finds America, always her secondary love interest. Enough has been written about this subject that I will just say a few things. First, note this key difference between Lana and lesser acts: she critiques the problems of America by participating in its iconography (imagine the stars and stripes on anybody else\u2019s album cover right now); others participate in problematizing America. \"You're beautiful and I\u2019m insane/ We're American-made,\" she sings on \"Venice Bitch.\" Sounds about right; again, what is good has flaws! Second, whose sound, more deftly than Lana\u2019s, has ushered us from second-term Obama into the collapse era of Trump? \"Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less,\" she sings, and isn\u2019t that just where we live now?\n\n\n\nI keep getting suggested this video on YouTube, thumbnailed with a picture of a straight-faced Billie Eilish, called \"The Death of Melody.\" The algorithm is eating its young. And they wouldn\u2019t be there without Lana: it's hard to imagine an Eilish, a Lorde, or a Halsey, without her first. \u201cDeath of Melody\u201d might describe her acolytes, but it\u2019s surely not high-flying Lana, always on the verge of scatting, our great Norah Jones with cusses. Lana\u2019s the one who sings that she\u2019s \"obsessed with writing the next best American record,\u201d and she has the relentless consistency and necessary frames of reference\u2014she starts that song with a reference to Led Zeppelin, of all people\u2014to pull it off. Maybe this album is already it.\n\nIn a recent New York Times interview, Lana remembered celebrating Obama\u2019s election in Union Square, then, in great contrast, reflected on this summer\u2019s mass shootings and fires in the Amazon: \"Wow, this is not just a passing phase,\" she said. \"There\u2019s something extremely wrong.\" Apocalypse always hangs in the background her songs\u2014\u201cThe culture is lit, and if this is it\u201a I had a ball,\u201d she sings on \u201cThe Greatest\u201d\u2014but did you ever notice, Lana never panics? Instead, she sings about love, and about everything, \"Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman to have, but I have it.\" Maybe going to church really helps\u2014or maybe, in the endurance of the church through history, there is an echo of Lana Del Rey.", "description": "On 'Norman Fucking Rockwell,' she eases in, stretches out, and continues to fill the artistic space she created for herself on 'Born to Die.'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d69565edcb63d0008c3aee9/lede/1567187363161-GettyImages-1014780080.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8415xh;0xw,0.1585xh&resize=1200:*"}
