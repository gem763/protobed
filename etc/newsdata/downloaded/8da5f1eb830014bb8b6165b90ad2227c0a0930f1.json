In the third quarter, monthly active users were up 8 percent to 2.45 billion year-over-year. The company\u2019s daily active user numbers beat expectations slightly with 9 percent growth year-over-year to 1.62 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNow we have a clear path forward, not just in terms of product and business, but in terms of guidance from regulators which sets clear expectations and gives us a foundation to build on,\u201d chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said during a call with analysts.\n\nOn the earnings call, Zuckerberg said the company will continue to accept political ads, which he estimated will comprise 0.5 percent of the company\u2019s revenue next year. His comments came the same day Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced the platform would ban all political ads beginning in November.\n\nZuckerberg insisted that the policy is based on its commitment to free speech, not concerns about its bottom line. Democratic presidential candidates and others criticized Facebook earlier this month for declining to remove a Trump campaign ad that contained multiple falsehoods.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn a democracy, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for private companies to censor politicians or the news,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about free expression,\" Twitter\u2019s Dorsey tweeted. \u201cThis is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address.\u201d\n\nThe past few months have been among the rockiest in Facebook\u2019s 15-year history. In July, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission slapped Facebook with a historic $5 billion fine for repeated privacy violations. The agency levied a fine after a 16-month investigation stemming from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a political consultancy with ties to the Trump presidential campaign improperly accessed the data of tens of millions of Facebook users. The company\u2019s plan to disrupt the financial system with a not-yet-available cryptocurrency called Libra has received an icy reception from regulators and triggered a wave of accounts falsely purporting to sell the currency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut advertisers care most about being able to target large numbers of people with extremely precise tools, said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at research firm eMarketer. Despite Facebook\u2019s setbacks and scandals, she says, it\u2019s clear that advertisers still believe the platform delivers on those promises.\n\n\u201cFacebook is a company that is able to execute on the metrics that matter even though there are many, many major challenges in other areas,\u201d she said.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock price has been volatile over the past year, reaching a low of $123.02 a share in December and a high of $208.66 in July. On Wednesday, Facebook\u2019s stock price was up 4.5 percent in after-hours trading on the earnings.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more external pressure (on Facebook) because there\u2019s a view that the walls are closing in from a regulatory perspective, but investors only care about results,\u201d said Daniel Ives, a managing director and analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cInvestors are laser-focused on its strategy going forward, on balancing advertising growth with privacy issues, which continues to be a tightrope that Zuckerberg is trying to walk.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nChief Financial Officer Dave Wehner said increased emphasis on privacy from regulators, operating systems and the company itself may make it more difficult for advertisers to target their audience and could slow Facebook\u2019s revenue growth. For example, Apple\u2019s latest operating system iOS 13 reminds users which apps are tracking them via their location data.\n\nIt\u2019s been a particularly troubling month for Facebook, though analysts seemed confident Tuesday that advertisers would stick with the platform in the wake of one setback after another. Facebook was dealt a blow by the European Union\u2019s highest court, which determined that the social media company can be ordered to remove content worldwide. Facebook also said in October that Russian-backed accounts are sowing political discord on the platform in the run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Congress criticized nearly every aspect of the company\u2019s business at a hearing held a few days later. Facebook also learned this month that forty-six state attorneys general have joined an antitrust investigation of the company led by New York. The state probe comes in addition to the federal government\u2019s review of the company and its past acquisitions, WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nAD\n\nAsked about the antitrust investigation and probe, Zuckerberg said the success of platforms like Snapchat shows that the industry remains competitive. He also said he expects regulators to focus primarily on Facebook\u2019s 2012 acquisition of Instagram, which he said Facebook saw as both a competitor and a business that would be \u201ccomplementary\u201d to its own.\n\nAD\n\nYet Facebook remains the largest social media site in the world and continues to reinvent itself in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. The company says it is increasingly focused on privacy and plans to add end-to-end encryption to all of its messaging products, a move that has attracted positive attention from privacy experts but also raised the ire of regulators. Facebook has also begun compensating some news outlets for the stories it has historically republished for free on its News Tab.\n\nAs has been the case in quarters past, the company\u2019s user growth is concentrated primarily in areas outside the U.S., Canada and Europe, with a strong increase in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nAD", "description": "The social network\u2019s growth has defied criticism from privacy experts and regulators", "authors": ["Marie C.
