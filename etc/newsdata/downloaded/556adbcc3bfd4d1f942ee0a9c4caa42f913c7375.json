Bernie Sanders at a campaign rally on Saturday just outside her home district in Queens, New York, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday night.\n\nThe endorsement is unexpected and will likely give Sanders a boost as his campaign gets back on its feet following his recent heart attack. Sanders touted his \"special guest\" at Saturday's \"Bernie's Back\" rally on Tuesday night.\n\n\"We're looking forward to Saturday,\" Corbin Trent, Ocasio-Cortez's campaign spokesperson, told The Post.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's endorsement is something of a surprise as she has previously said she's far from making an endorsement in the 2020 race. She has also praised Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who will likely be hurt by Ocasio-Cortez's support of Sanders.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has co-sponsored legislation with both him and Warren. But when it comes to key policy issues, most notably healthcare, the Bronx native has overlapped more with her fellow democratic socialist.\n\nReps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, two other members of the so-called \"Squad\" of progressive freshman congresswomen, will also endorse Sanders, CNN reported Tuesday night. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, the fourth member of the squad, has not indicated whether she'll endorse a 2020 candidate at this point in the race.\n\nSanders has co-sponsored legislation with all three women. He's worked with Ocasio-Cortez on a bill to cap credit card interest rates, with Omar on a universal school meals program and legislation to eliminate student debt.", "description": "Rep.
