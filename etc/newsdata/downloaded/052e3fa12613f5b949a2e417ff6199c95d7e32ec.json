I think it could be big. I think Teen Mom should definitely be taking over YouTube, on the airplane when I'm traveling, all over. Maybe I'll have to work on the distribution and business part, and then I'll come back.\"\n\nAnd while she may not be in touch with her co-stars, Maci Bookout, Amber Portwood and Catelynn Lowell, Farrah did note that she still has close contacts with the show.\n\n\"I'm just blessed to have good relationships with the executives and producers and the people that I first met, so that's great,\" she said. \"But I do wish the other ladies the best. They're trying their hardest.\"\n\nView photos Presley Ann/Getty Images for WE tv More\n\nWhen asked about her recent reveal that she's given Teen Mom 2 star Jenelle Evans some legal advice, Farrah was a bit more tight-lipped on the subject.\n\n\"Am I allowed? You know, I actually have some big stuff that I promised some executives at Viacom that I would not be talking about that, but I wish all the Teen Mom ladies, Teen Mom especially, all the best,\" she said. \"It's amazing. Maybe I'll be an entertainment lawyer one day. I think I'm great at that.\"\n\nSo how has Farrah, who was known for stirring the pot with her co-stars in the past, become so zen?\n\nFarrah said she credits \"the lovely anger management that I've been given from court a couple times\" with helping her deal with the haters. She added, \"Yeah, just passing that along in a fun and knowledgable way because kids don't really want to hear 'anger management' or 'be thoughtful' or 'just keep it quiet.' But I've learned it now.\"\n\nFarrah also shared that not only has her 10-year-old daughter, Sophia, been working on her own mental health, she's also been hard at work.\n\n\"Sofia is the big 10, she's doing good. She's going to castings every day. She's a little star in her own right. I'm so blessed and thankful for my daughter that I have,\" Farrah said. \"Hopefully there's going to be a lot of great mother-daughter projects where you guys can see us.\"\n\nIn addition to potentially collaborating with her daughter, Farrah is also trying to elevate her memoir, My Teenage Dream Ended, to the next level.\n\n\"I have been working over a year with screenwriting, turning my New York Times bestselling book, My Teenage Dream Ended, into a feature film,\" she revealed.\n\nMarriage Boot Camp: Family Edition airs Fridays at 10 p.m. ET on WE tv.\n\nFor more from the Teen Mom stars, watch the clip below:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nJenelle Evans' Husband David Eason Admits He Killed Her Dog: 'It Was Not Something I Wanted to Do'\n\nFarrah Abraham Says Jenelle Evans Called Her for 'Teen Mom' Advice After Getting Fired\n\nFarrah Abraham Pleads Not Guilty to Misdemeanor Battery and Resisting Arrest Following Hotel Altercation\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "The reality star opened up to ET about her life after the MTV show that created her fame.", "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HoOYbv_OVBSWhw45gZ9iKw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/82789789eb5bacd44ae207fc59644d0f", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
