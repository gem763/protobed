But this would not get Brexit done. It will, instead, be the start of a long and bitter series of negotiations for our country which could still end in a no deal outcome.\u201d\n\nThe former prime ministers Tony Blair and Sir John Major have also united to make a short film warning against Brexit and its impact on Northern Ireland to be broadcast at the rally.\n\nThe pair, who faced each other across the dispatch box between 1994 and 1997 and helped broker the Good Friday agreement, have both been vociferous in their calls to avoid a hard Brexit.\n\nBlair said: \u201cThe Good Friday agreement was a careful, painstaking construction in which the conflicting aspirations of unionists and nationalists were held in the most delicate balance.\n\n\u201cNow either there is a hard border between Northern Ireland and Britain or a hard border between the north and south of Ireland. And it is a shame and an outrage that peace in Northern Ireland is now treated as some disposable inconvenience to be bartered away in exchange for satisfying the obsession of the Brexiteers with wrenching our country out of Europe.\u201d\n\nMajor, who has made several high-profile interventions against Brexit, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a whole generation of people in Northern Ireland who have no memory of what life was like before the Good Friday agreement. No one under the age of 20 would have any memory of the violence and death that once engulfed their neighbourhoods. I hope and pray they never do.\u201d\n\nThe People\u2019s Vote march will set off from Park Lane at midday and reach Parliament Square at 2pm with a rally lasting 90 minutes for speakers to address the crowds.\n\nIt was scheduled for 19 October to coincide with the provisions of Labour MP Hilary Benn\u2019s act. The Benn act legislated for Saturday to be the deadline by which a deal needed to be passed or the prime minister must request an extension of article 50 from the EU.\n\nThe rally may be one of the best attended of the three People\u2019s Vote demonstrations so far, with a record 172 coaches bringing in campaigners from across the country. Previous marches are believed to have attracted between 500,000 and a million people.\n\nPauline Hardman, a food bank volunteer, is travelling to London for the first time from Ushaw Moor in County Durham \u2013 a former mining village.\n\nShe did not vote in the 2016 referendum but said she feared Brexit would damage former coal communities in the north.\n\nShe said: \u201cPeople in mining villages like mine are getting more and more worried about the damage Brexit will cause. We can see it\u2019s a million miles from what was promised back in 2016, we know this matters and we want to have our say.\n\n\u201cIf you read the newspapers, you\u2019d think that everyone in the north-east thinks exactly the same way, that we all want Brexit whatever the cost, but that\u2019s not what I hear when I speak to my neighbours and friends.\u201d\n\nAnother marcher will be Stephen Goodall, 97, who served in the far east during during the second world war and is travelling to the protest from his home in south Devon.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m 97 years old, my knees are knackered from playing rugby, and I\u2019ll be in a wheelchair, but as long as I\u2019m still alive and kicking, I\u2019ll march to defend the democracy I\u2019ve always fought to protect.\u201d\n\nThe mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will be supporting the event, as well as the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and the Labour MPs David Lammy, Benn, Jess Phillips and Chi Onwurah.\n\nThe Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, and her party\u2019s MPs Ed Davey, Layla Moran, Luciana Berger and Sam Gyimah will be attending, as will the former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine, the leader of the Independent Group for Change, Anna Soubry, the independent MP Antoinette Sandbach, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts, the SNP\u2019s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, and the SNP MP Joanna Cherry.\n\nQuick guide How is Boris Johnson's Brexit deal different from Theresa May's? Show Hide The new Brexit deal is essentially the old Brexit deal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a link to the full text. The backstop is replaced The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly. Consent Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years. The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge. That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020. Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not. Checks on border, ports and airports Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d. Future trade deals The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched. Customs Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods. No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use. Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above. A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed. West/east trade The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated. VAT EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland. Single electricity market The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change. Level playing field This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.
