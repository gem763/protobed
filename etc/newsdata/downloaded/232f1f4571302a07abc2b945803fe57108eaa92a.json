While celebrity couple Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham from the \u201cBachelor\u201d helped their unborn child, Alessi Ren Luyendyk, amass a verified following of hundreds of thousands while A-listers like George and Amal Clooney have reportedly worked hard to keep their children away from cameras.\n\nAlthough baby Alessi doesn\u2019t appear to have a business account activated to make money on Instagram like a traditional influencer, the feat of having such a large following has some critics scratching their heads. At less than five months old, Alessi has over 322,000 followers and a blue checkmark that verifies her identity to the public.\n\nEven for adults, getting verified on social media isn\u2019t an open or clear-cut process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely arbitrary about who they\u2019ll verify, who they won\u2019t,\u201d attorney Barry Janay told FOX Business.\n\nAccording to Janay, it all depends on what is specified in each platform\u2019s terms of service. However, he noted that the law is slow when it comes to regulating media and that current circumstances are like a brave new world.\n\nInfluencer pages that showcase users who are younger than the terms of service often note that they are run by the parents, which might provide a loophole big enough to prevent de-platforming underage stars.\n\nOther children \u2013 or rather parents \u2013 have found lucrative ways to make money on social media while showcasing unique talents or humorous antics.\n\nRyan Kaji of Ryan ToysReview, the YouTube channel with an eye boggling 22 million subscriber count, made news last year when it was revealed that the seven-year-old boy was the platform\u2019s highest-earning star. According to estimates by Forbes, Ryan raked in $22 million for his toy reviews \u2013 a talent he surely crafted since his toddler debut.\n\nHis first video, \u201cKid playing with toys Lego Duplo Number Train,\u201d has over 48 million views.\n\nRyan\u2019s influence has been substantial enough for the watchdog group Truth in Advertising, which has filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission against the popular YouTube page over \u201csponsored videos that often have the look and feel of organic content.\u201d\n\nDespite the \u201cdeceptive native advertising\u201d accusation and YouTube\u2019s minimum age requirement of 13 under Google, Ryan\u2019s likeness has been a golden one for Nickelodeon. The media mogul, who hasn\u2019t even reached the age of 10, stars in his own show \u201cRyan\u2019s Mystery Playdate\u201d on Nick Jr. and has an international merchandise deal with the network, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nToy reviews aren\u2019t the only big moneymakers for kiddos. The beauty world is a multibillion-dollar industry that\u2019s willing to pay popular online personalities for promotion too.\n\nJayde Kamille, who went viral over a \u201csalon talk\u201d video at age 1 in 2017 and received a tour of Sea World after amassing more than 19 million views, has gone on to have a dedicated Instagram and YouTube pages that have hundreds of thousands of fans who watch her beauty reviews.\n\nBoth platforms have contact methods listed for booking Jayde, who is now four-years old, for brand partnerships. These collaborations often get posted online as hair or skin care tutorials featuring Jayde\u2019s commentary.\n\nJust like Ryan, Jayde has a dedicated and engaged audience that support the unorthodox career path. The preschooler made her official TV debut alongside comedian Tiffany Haddish in ABC\u2019s reboot of \u201cKids Say the Darndest Things.\u201d\n\nFor the parents of twins, having double doesn\u2019t mean trouble in the influencer sphere. In a report by CBS News, the Instagram famous duo Taytum and Oakley Fisher could \u201cearn upwards of $200,000 per month, with money coming in from brand deals and advertising revenue\u201d thanks to their generous following. On Instagram alone, the pair have over 3.1 million followers.\n\nSimilarly, the \u201cMcClure Twins,\u201d Ava and Alexis have over 1.9 million followers on Instagram and have been recognized as top influencers by Forbes and even have a dedicated Digital Star page that details how the pair is \u201cable to command an average of $10,000 per sponsorship or partnership.\u201d\n\nWhether shouldering the life of an influencer onto an infant or child can be qualified as abuse, Janay said it really depends on what goes on inside the home.\n\n\u201cThere is a potential labor law issue where parents might be subjecting their kids into forced labor and give them limited civil rights compared to adults because they are not emancipated unless they get a court order,\u201d Janay explained hypothetically regarding children who may not like the lifestyle and the imbalanced power dynamic.\n\n\u201cWhether forcing them to work and doing a product review\u2026 You know, kids say no. I tell my daughter to brush her teeth, she says no, but she\u2019s going to brush her teeth. I\u2019m going to force her to brush her teeth,\u201d Janay said as a reasonable example for making an infant or child do something they don\u2019t want to do.\n\nHowever, forcing an infant or child to participate in YouTube channel that an adult signed up for is completely separate instance that has legal ramifications circling around it.\n\n\u201cThe parent, as a custodial guardian, they can lose that right if it\u2019s deemed [as] abuse,\u201d Janay said simply for anyone who uses harsh means to mold their offspring into a star.\n\nWhen it comes to contract law with minors, Janay explained that businesses can enforce signed agreements on anyone under the age of 18. They can, however, take it up with the parents who signed a contract for their child.\n\nConversely, Janay cited a 1983 court case that involved actress Brooke Shields suing fashion photographer Garry Gross for photographing her nude when she was 10-years-old and distributing those images to Playboy Press for publication. The provocative modeling job was signed off by Shields\u2019 mother and ultimately in a four-to-three decision, the Court of Appeals said the 17-year-old actress could not break a contract signed by her mother in 1975.\n\nThe ruling allowed for the continued distribution of the photos so long as they were not published in a pornographic outlet \u2013 which is a stark contrast to what society would deem as appropriate in 2019.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nOutside of the many contract, privacy and consent questions that come with a young person\u2019s digital stardom, compensation is not clear.\n\nIn select states, the entertainment industry requires compliance with the Coogan Law, a piece of legislation enacted in 1939 to protect child stars after actor Jackie Coogan sued his parents for squandering his wages. The law requires 15 percent of a child\u2019s earning to be stashed away in a specialized trust fund. There is no current extension of this law for young social media influencers.\n\nAdditionally, being under the age of 18 doesn\u2019t mean Uncle Sam won\u2019t reach for his cut.\n\nAccording to Turbo Tax, \u201cAll dependent children who earn more than $12,000 of income in 2018 must file a personal income tax return and might owe tax to the IRS. Earned income only applies to wages and salaries your child receives as a result of providing services to an employer, even if only through a part-time job.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nMoney aside, critics of baby and kid influencers are concerned with the psychological and physical dangers that come with being thrust into the spotlight. From having their moves documented constantly to enduring meet-and-greet events with strangers after the unfortunate shooting of former \u201cVoice\u201d star Christina Grimmie, there are numerous safety considerations the parents of influencers have to reckon with.\n\nStrangest of all may be the community of role players on Instagram who collect photos of babies and children and pretend to either adopt or be the kids they are depicting.\n\nA victim of this phenomenon who goes by the name of Jenny told Fast Company that experiencing someone roleplaying as her baby made her reconsider what she shared on her blog.\n\n\u201cI was focused on sharing my story as part of a community with parents of preemies and infertility survivors,\u201d Jenny explained. \u201cI thought I was doing something good. It turns out I was putting my kids out there in a negative fashion. I still can\u2019t even wrap my head around it.\u201d\n\nSimilar circumstances occur with social media influencers whether it be through role play, fan pages or catfishing.", "description": "Influencers are big money makers in the digital world and the trend is gaining traction with even younger crowds.
