I thought it would be much more difficult for him, I thought it would take a little bit longer, but he\u2019s played very, very well.\n\n\u201cThe question mark is still how much can his body take week in, week out. There\u2019s still a long road back.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s played two matches back to back, but can he play three, four, five days in a row? It\u2019s too hard to predict. I think we\u2019ll know more when he plays the Australian Open and a three-out-of-five-set match.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not his mentality or his tennis, it\u2019s what the body will allow him to do. But the signs are very positive.\u201d\n\nRusedski and Murray are on a list that now includes Dan Evans, who at 43 in the world is the top-ranked player in Britain for the first time.\n\nEvans\u2019 stellar form since returning unranked from a year-long drugs ban last spring coupled with Kyle Edmund\u2019s slide has left the 29-year-old in top spot, and Rusedski believes he can climb significantly higher.\n\nAnd Dan Evans celebrates becoming the new British No.1 by battling past Tomic 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 in Stockholm #BackTheBrits \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 pic.twitter.com/ZfqLxJCfWG \u2014 LTA (@the_LTA) October 14, 2019\n\n\u201cSometimes you go through difficult situations and it forces you to grow up and take stock and do all those things that Dan has done,\u201d said Rusedski.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always known he had the talent and the ability and I had a feeling at the beginning of this year when I saw him in Australia that he was going to have a fantastic season.\n\n\u201cI think top 20 would be a realistic goal for him if he can keep on the momentum he\u2019s had this season.\u201d\n\nEdmund will find himself outside the top 70 on Monday having started the season ranked 14.\n\nGreg Rusedski helped out at a Cancer Research UK shop to launch the charity\u00b4s partnership with the Nitto ATP Finals (Dan Barnett/Cancer Research UK)\n\nA knee injury plagued him for the first half of the season and Edmund is currently on a seven-match losing run dating back to early August.\n\nRusedski also cited the split from coach Fredrik Rosengren, who retired abruptly in February.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to reset, look at what he needs to do and really use this off season to push forward and improve his game,\u201d said Rusedski, a former coach of Edmund.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get up to the top 15 but it\u2019s even harder to stay there because you\u2019ve got to continually get better, you have to be healthy and you have to have the right team around you.\n\nBest win since his comeback\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f https://t.co/viP51TifVV \u2014 Greg Rusedski (@GregRusedski1) October 1, 2019\n\n\u201cThe second year when you get there is always the toughest, which Kyle\u2019s gone through, and year three is usually the rebound year so there\u2019s no reason why Kyle shouldn\u2019t be back in the top 50 in 2020.\u201d\n\nRusedski was speaking while he helped out at a Cancer Research UK shop to launch the charity\u2019s partnership with the Nitto ATP Finals in London next month.\n\nA treasure hunt across several Cancer Research UK shops in London and on the charity\u2019s EBay shop from October 18 to November 10 will offer fans the chance to claim prizes including signed items from leading players.\n\nRusedski said: \u201cEverybody in their life has been affected with cancer somehow or another, so I think it\u2019s a great cause and a great partnership.\u201d\n\nDaniil Medvedev holds aloft his trophy from the Shanghai Masters (Andy Wong/AP)\n\nThe tournament at the O2 is shaping up to be a battle of the young challengers versus the old guard, with US Open finalist Daniil Medvedev the current front runner to be the best of the next generation.\n\nMedvedev\u2019s success has reignited the debate about when a new face is going to win a grand slam.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting closer,\u201d said Rusedski. \u201cI thought it was either going to be next year or the year after. Medvedev is the guy you\u2019re looking at who could possibly win one. It\u2019ll be a very exciting end of the season, which will set up 2020 beautifully.\u201d\n\n:: Keen treasure hunters are advised to seek out @CRUKshops on Instagram to get involved.
