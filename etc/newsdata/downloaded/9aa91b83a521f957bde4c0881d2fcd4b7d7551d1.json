The demonstrations began in response to a proposed extradition law and have expanded to include other grievances and demands for democracy in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)\n\nHONG KONG (AP) \u2014 High school students in Hong Kong added gas masks, goggles and hard hats to their formal white uniforms as they participated in a strike Monday on the first day of school to show their commitment to the city's fiery anti-government protest movement.\n\nThe nearly three months of youth-dominated protests \u2014 calling for democracy and an independent inquiry into police conduct \u2014 will be tested as classes resume after the summer break in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.\n\nStrikers gathered in the hundreds at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and two public spaces in the city's central business district. Workers on strike congregated in Tamar Park, while at nearby Edinburgh Place, high school students who were skipping class rallied around a black banner that read, \"With no future, there's no need to go to class.\"\n\nAt St. Francis' Canossian College, uniformed students kneeled in a line and held up hand-painted signs that read, \"The five major demands: Not one is dispensable.\" The elite girls' school is where Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam was educated.\n\nHong Kong Education Secretary Kevin Yeung said he hoped students would stay in class.\n\n\"Schools should not be used as places for political demands or exercising pressure,\" he said at a government briefing.\n\nThe protesters' demands include dropping charges against demonstrators who have been arrested and formally withdrawing an extradition bill that would allow Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China to stand trial. The appeals are undergirded by a sense among some Hong Kong residents that the Communist Party-ruled mainland government has been eroding the autonomy and civil liberties promised when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997.\n\nSome demonstrators disrupted the morning commute on Monday by blocking train doors, attempting to evade riot police who were hot on their heels by moving quickly between multiple public transit stations.\n\nOfficers at Lok Fu station hit protesters with batons and arrested one. Another three were arrested at Lai King station.\n\nOn Sunday, the MTR Corp. suspended train service to the airport after several hundred protesters gathered there following calls online to disrupt transportation. They blocked buses arriving at the airport but police in riot helmets kept them out of the terminal.\n\nAfter protesters allegedly vandalized ticketing machines in Prince Edward station on Sunday, video footage showed police storming into the facility and beating up, pepper spraying and arresting passengers who police said were violent demonstrators.\n\nClashes between police and protesters have become increasingly violent, as the self-described \"front-line\" demonstrators use petrol bombs and throw rods at officers. Authorities in turn have employed water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets and batons.\n\nThe protesters say that a degree of violence is necessary to get the government's attention after peaceful rallies were futile. Lam's administration, however, maintains that the violence must first end before any fruitful dialogue can begin.\n\n\"We always say that we must stop the violence right away, and then kick off the dialogue,\" said Administration Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-Chung.", "description": "High school students in Hong Kong added gas masks, goggles and hard hats to their formal white uniforms as they participated in a strike Monday on the first day of school to show their commitment to the city's fiery anti-government protest movement.
