Decried by critics as a boondoggle, the program has been beset by cost overruns, with software delays for the jets, corrosion and problems with tire durability and ejection seats.\n\nEarlier this year, the Pentagon's Office of Inspector General found that Defense Department officials did not account for and manage $2.1 billion worth of F-35 parts over 16 years. Instead, the Pentagon must rely on Lockheed to tell the Defense Department where and when it spent those funds.\n\nDefense officials sought to downplay such issues on Tuesday and instead highlighted the lower cost per aircraft across all three types of the F-35.\n\nThe per-jet cost of the Air Force\u2019s F-35A will be $78 million each, the first time the price has fallen below $80 million.\n\nThe Marine Corps F-35B, meanwhile, will fall to $101.3 million per aircraft, and the Navy\u2019s F-35C will drop to $94.4 million.\n\nLockheed Martin also touted the lower cost.\n\n\u201cWith smart acquisition strategies, strong government-industry partnership and a relentless focus on quality and cost reduction, the F-35 Enterprise has successfully reduced procurement costs of the 5th Generation F-35 to equal or less than 4th Generation legacy aircraft,\u201d Lockheed F-35 Vice President Greg Ulmer said in a statement.\n\nOne international partner that will not be using the F-35 is Turkey, a NATO ally.\n\nThe Pentagon this year removed Turkey as a partner in the program after the country took delivery of a Russian air defense system, which officials feared could be used to gather sensitive information from the F-35.\n\nLord said Tuesday there \u201chas been no change to return Turkey to the F-35 program.\u201d", "description": "The Defense Department and Lockheed Martin have finalized a\u00a0$34 billion\u00a0contract for F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, a record amount for the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/f-35_lockheedmartin_021111getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
