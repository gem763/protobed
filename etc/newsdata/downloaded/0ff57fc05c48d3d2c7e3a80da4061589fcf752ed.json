One death has been linked to the unrest, when a demonstrator protesting on the side of a building fell during a botched rescue attempt.\n\nTens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed since the Kashmir insurgency erupted in the 1980s. New Delhi puts the toll at 47,000, while rights groups hover around 70,000.\n\nThe curfew is no longer in place there, though tens of thousands of extra security forces are still in place, some restrictions on movement remain and communications are still largely blacked out.\n\nKhan, whose government has been criticised for shrinking press freedoms in recent months, also expressed his frustration with the global community, which has historically stayed out of Kashmir.\n\n\"I regret that the world only sees that (India) is a country with one billion (people), so they can trade and make money from them, and money is more important for these countries then humans,\" he said.\n\nPakistan calls China, which has invested billions in the country, its \"all-weather friend\".\n\nChinese state media has repeatedly warned foreign firms that voicing support for Hong Kong protesters could cost them access to China's market of 1.4 billion people, with the NBA the latest to be targeted.\n\nChina has also defied escalating global criticism over its treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang province, where rights groups say one million people have been put in re-education camps.\n\nPakistan, which borders Xinjiang, has shrugged at the accusations. \"Frankly, I don't know much about that,\" Khan told the Financial Times in March.\n\nburs-zz-st/ind", "description": "Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan accused international media Friday of a \"double standard\", saying news outlets give more prominence to the ongoing protests in Hong Kong than to the situation in disputed Kashmir.
