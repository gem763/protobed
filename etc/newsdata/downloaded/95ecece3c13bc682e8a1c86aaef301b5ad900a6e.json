This side of the family was listed as \"perished\" in the Holocaust at Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s official memorial to the Holocaust\u2019s victims.\n\nElbaz had been working on her family\u2019s genealogy and placed an ad on JewishGen, which caught the attention of her now-found cousin Gemma Brown in England.\n\nThey connected as soon as possible.\n\nAs it turns out, Ofer had also submitted a DNA test years ago, which matched with the DNA of Brown and her mother, Alison O\u2019Callaghan -- Mairowitz's daughter.\n\n\"It all fell into place,\" Ofer told \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nElbaz sent Ofer pictures of Mairowitz and Ofer knew instantly that he was family.\n\n(MORE: Holocaust survivor reunites with family who saved her through Facebook)\n\n\"I immediately recognized him because he looks exactly like my dad,\" Ofer said.\n\nOnce they were connected, Ofer and O\u2019Callaghan jumped on FaceTime in what was an emotional phone call.

Ofer said she thinks her father survived because he was a blonde, blue-eyed boy with \"Aryan\" features.\n\nSana escaped with his sister and mother, fleeing for close to two years.\n\nPHOTO: Morris Sana holds a photo of himself when he was younger.
