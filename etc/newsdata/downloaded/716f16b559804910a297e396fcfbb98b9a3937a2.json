But Ali is thankful for the opportunity.\n\nShe told E! News: \u2018Size 14 is actually the average size of women in America and I do think that we need to see more of it in media and fashion because most women are that size. So, we need to be accurately represented in brands and media,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018For Victoria\u2019s Secret I am so excited that they decided to put a size 14 women like me on the wall,\u2019 she added. \u2018I feel like they are headed in the right direction and they are listening to their audience who have requested to see more women of diverse shapes and sizes.\n\n\u2018I think if they continue to head in that direction they will be on to a jackpot because that is reflective of what the average woman is in America.\u2019\n\nIn the past models such as Barbara Palvin and Lorena Duran have been hailed VS\u2019s first \u2018plus-models\u2019 though they are both relatively average.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey have referred to themselves as curvy instead.\n\nAli says she\u2019s not the first plus-size model for the brand but is the first size 14 (Picture: Instagram)\n\nBluebella for Victoria\u2019s Secret line includes lingerie, sleepwear, and hosiery featuring luxe details, including velvet, satin, and embroidered lace.\n\nAt the moment the line is available at select Victoria\u2019s Secret stores in the US where it opened last week.\n\nBut worry not, it will be available at stores in the UK starting on 11 October.\n\nHappy shopping.\n\nMORE: Victoria\u2019s Secret has a lot to learn from Rihanna\u2019s Savage x Fenty show\n\nMORE: Victoria\u2019s Secret model opens up about body dysmorphia as she recovers from eating disorder\n\nMORE: Victoria\u2019s Secret model Behati Prinsloo opens up about her experience with postpartum depression\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Victoria's Secret joined forces with London-based lingerie brand Bluebella which employs plus size women", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89094265_1570617085.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
