So the pilot taxied back to gate where plane was met by throng of police. They came on board and escorted the protester off the plane.\"\n\n\"And the final irony of the climate protest on our flight. We cannot take off until we have taken on extra fuel...to replace the fuel used up during the protest, our pilot notes with humour,\" Watt added. He said passengers applauded crew members for how they dealt with the protester.\n\nAer Lingus added in a statement that a man was taken off the flight for \"disruptive behaviour on board,\" before a security check of the aircraft was carried out.\n\nThe protests are part of the group's week of action in the capital and across the UK, which have seen roads closed near the Houses of Parliament and near other landmarks. Demonstrations are also being held in various other cities around the world.\n\nA protester is arrested after refusing to sit down on a flight to Dublin. John Clarke/Twitter\n\nLola Newton, a protester from Edinburgh, told CNN: \"I'm here to support the disruption of the things that need to be disrupted to avert climate meltdowns.\"\n\nNewton added of the police response: \"At times it's been aggressive but mostly British police are pretty calm ... go anywhere else in the world (and) this wouldn't be possible, so I'm very grateful for their behavior.\"\n\nCressida Dick, the head of London's Metropolitan Police, said in a video statement on Thursday that more than 600 protesters have been arrested across London in the past two days.", "description": "An environmental activist climbed on top of a plane on the runway of London's City Airport Thursday, as part of a series of protests at the site by the group Extinction Rebellion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191010134848-extinction-rebellion-city-airport-2-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
