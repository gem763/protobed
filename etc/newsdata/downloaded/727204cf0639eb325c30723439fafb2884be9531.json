She tried to deliver it in the Legislative Coucil, but pro-democratic lawmakers kept booing her.\n\nAfter nearly four months of anti-government protests, Lam had the chance to address Hong Kong\u2019s biggest political crisis since the handover. But she didn\u2019t say a single word about the protesters\u2019 five demands. Instead, she focused on solving the city\u2019s housing problems, helping the poor, and extra funding for education.\n\nA major plan is to spend HK$5 billion on building 10,000 transitional homes within the next three years for those on the waiting list for public housing.\n\nHong Kong protests: Secondary students rally at HKU to condemn anti-mask law and alleged police abuse of power\n\nThe government will also offer a \u201cone-off subsidy\u201d for low-income households who are not living in public rental flats and not receiving financial aid from the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA). The limit on the rent allowance for CSSA households has also been raised from about three to 27 per cent according to the number of members in the household.\n\nMeanwhile, first-time homebuyers will be allowed to take out bigger loans. The lending limit has been raised from HK$4 million to HK$8 million for buyers who are eligible to borrow up to 90 per cent of the value of a flat. Those who can afford a mortgage worth up to 80 per cent of a property price will be able to borrow up to HK$10 million, instead of HK$6 million.\n\nHong Kong protests: Police block Civil Human Rights Front march against mask ban planned for Sunday\n\nBut Hong Kong protesters have accused Lam of using these new plans to silence the middle class. Some also argued that properties will only become more expensive, or that new homebuyers might end up with a flat worth less than the amount they borrowed to buy it.\n\nNew measures aimed at primary and secondary students include changing the one-off grant to an annual allowance of HK$2,500, as well as more support for non-Chinese speaking students and special needs students.\n\nLam also said that local secondary students studying certain postgraduate programmes that are key to Hong Kong\u2019s development would be offered sponsorships.", "description": "Chief executive focused on solving the city\u2019s housing problems and helping the needy, while no concessions were offered to anti-government protesters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/65db8c52-f180-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires185930.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
