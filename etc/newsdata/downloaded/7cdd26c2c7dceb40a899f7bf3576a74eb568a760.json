But in the decade since, the two stars\u2019 paths have drastically diverged: Swift into anthem-heavy pop megastardom, Kanye into footwear and God. If we treat that moment as a sort of ground zero for both their ensuing careers, could we not imagine a series of different outcomes and consequences stemming from this moment, and write them out in fun and snappy and word count-adherent hypotheticals? Well, strangely, yes. Here\u2019s what might\u2019ve happened.\n\nKanye and Taylor become \u2018Kanyor Swist\u2019\n\nThe year 2009 was towards the end of The Neg-era \u2013 that Game-inspired putdown-cum-flirting tactic \u2013 and if you think about it, the most neg Neg possible is getting on stage exactly when someone\u2019s being awarded for being good at something and telling them that actually they\u2019re rubbish and deserve nothing. This is how we get an alt-timeline where: Kanye and Taylor become an amalgamated couple post-VMAs, Kimye never happens and Swift\u2019s Red album never exists, because all the Vogue shoots and pre-2012 heartbreak never happened because she\u2019s been holed up in an LA mansion for nigh-on 10 years with her lover, West. Kanye still does his blog. Taylor\u2019s shaved her head. Shutter sunglasses are still in vogue. It\u2019s a terrible place to live.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 never happens\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Beyonc\u00e9 at the 2009 VMAs. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nHardest one to justify, this: something about Beyonc\u00e9, her sheer Beyonc\u00e9ness, suggests that, on every alt-timeline, she is still Beyonc\u00e9; Beyonc\u00e9 cannot escape her destin\u00e9, Beyonc\u00e9 is Beyonc\u00e9 in every simulation run of the planet, the only constant, more enduring than the sun. That said: say the Kanye Interruption worked as intended, and the best video award was handed out to Beyonc\u00e9 on the night \u2026 how would that spin her particular ensuing career axis? Maybe she would have stuck to the Sasha Fierce alter ego, running it into the ground in an effort to further cement that MTV endorsement, zigging away from the artistic groundwork of 4 that led to the darker, stormier Drunk in Love era, and instead she just kept turning up to red-carpet parties with that Single Ladies robot glove on, glimmering in the background of paparazzi shots as other MTV VMA 2009 era celebrities \u2013 like 3OH!3, maybe, remember them? \u2013 become Beyonc\u00e9-famous instead. Imagine 3OH!3\u2019s Lemonade. Thank the dark and mysterious ancient powers that bore you on to this earth, and not the one that had that.\n\nKanye is subject to a rigorous intervention from his friends\n\nFair to say Kanye\u2019s interruption in 2009 was \u201cvery cognac-inspired\u201d and, in a just and right world, his mates (does Kanye have mates? Someone check please) (Just thinking about how exhausting it would be to be Kanye\u2019s mate. Have decided since the last brackets: Kanye doesn\u2019t have mates) would sit him down in a quiet room and tell him: \u201cKanye, though aesthetically this is your greatest ever era, and last year\u2019s 808s is your most underrated album, you probably need to not get up on stage during Taylor Swift\u2019s acceptance speech and start yelling about Beyonc\u00e9; come on buddy, let\u2019s get you to some nice cosy talking therapy.\u201d Ultimately, the only thing different about a timeline where Kanye West addresses his demons in 2009 rather than post-Kim is we do not have the album Ye, and I think we can all agree that\u2019s no great net loss.\n\nHennessy Cognac.\n\nTaylor goes off-piste\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing Taylor Swift is known for, it\u2019s for being an almost painfully wholesome presence in the pop world, sort of like if a BuzzFeed five-ingredient brownie recipe came to life and started doing stadium tour choreography. In the 10 years since The Kanye Incident, she has behaved with nothing but distant grace and beef-free decorum in relation to it and the ensuing remembrances (see: Kim Kardashian beef, circa 2016). But what if that\u2019s all Kanye\u2019s doing? Think about it: is it not possible that, 10 years ago, Kanye West handed Taylor, on stage, a sort of bulletproof moral high ground, and it\u2019s been the handbrake on any bad behaviour ever since. She cannot possibly rebel because if she does that she will \u201cKanye\u201d herself, and therefore lose. As Taylor (now) approaches the age of Kanye (then), she is nowhere near getting ungraciously drunk on Hennessy and interrupting someone else\u2019s awards speech. Without a Kanye-shaped villain for Taylor to be the golden light in contrast to, alt-universe Taylor is currently in her OxyContin phase and flirting with a face tattoo, simply because there\u2019s no one to prove wrong by not doing it.", "description": "Ye\u2019s interruption at the VMAs 10 years ago sent the stars on different paths.
