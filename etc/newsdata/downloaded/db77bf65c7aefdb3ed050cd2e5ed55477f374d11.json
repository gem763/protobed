Col. Vindman", "language": "en", "text": "Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer on Wednesday demanded that the Secretary of the Army take steps to protect Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman after he testified in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump.\n\nMr. Schumer said he wanted assurances Col. Vindman receive whistleblower protection \u201cboth from retaliation and for the personal safety of him and his family\u201d after his character was assailed by the president and Trump allies in the news media.\n\n\u201cHe is a patriot for being willing to do what we hope and expect every service member will do: to tell the truth when asked,\u201d Mr. Schumer, New York Democrat, wrote in a letter to Army commanders. \u201cIt is incumbent on the Army to ensure that he is afforded the same protections as whistleblowers and protected from reprisal for testifying before Congress.\u201d\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle rushed to defend Col. Vindman, a member of the National Security Council, when Mr. Trump dismissed his testimony as from a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d\n\nCol. Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient, told the House impeachment probe that he objected to omissions in the White House\u2019s rough transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, according to reports.\n\nThe July 25 call is at the heart of the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. A whistleblower who is believed to be a CIA official assigned to the White House accused the president of abuse of power when he pushed for an investigation of alleged corruption involving a political rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\nCol. Vindman\u2019s testimony did not dramatically alter the view of Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct on the call. The transcript showed Mr. Trump asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for a \u201cfavor\u201d to investigate Mr. Biden and other corruption allegations.\n\nDemocrats argue that Mr. Trump withheld U.S. military aid as leverage to get the investigation of Mr. Biden, who is a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe transcript did not include the quid pro quo that is the linchpin of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment case.\n\nIn the letter to Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy and Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. James C. McConville, Mr. Schumer asked for a briefing on steps taken to protect Col. Vindman.\n\n\u201cI urge you to issue public statements indicating your support for him and others in the U.S. Armed Forces who fulfill their duty to tell the truth when asked to do so,\u201d Mr. Schumer wrote.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
