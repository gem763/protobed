One basis point is equal to one one-hundredth of one percentage point.\n\nFrom a credit perspective, though, there\u2019s little difference with the green bond than if the company had issued a non-green senior unsecured note.\n\n\u201cThe bonds issued yesterday are pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of PepsiCo and based on credit risk and recovery analysis we would expect them to trade in line with the PepsiCo Inc senior unsecured debt, as demonstrated by yesterday\u2019s final pricing,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nBond proceeds, the company says, will help PepsiCo hit a new target to reduce 35% of virgin plastic content across its beverage portfolio by 2025. The money raised will help reach this target by funding projects that purchase compostable, biodegradable and/or recyclable material for use in product packaging, and by investing in the development of packaging that includes bio-based polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, bottles that can be recycled as other products, such as carpets, and compostable and biodegradable snacks flex films instead of hard packaging.\n\nRead: Metals billionaire Andrew Forrest is making a $300 million bet on the next big commodity \u2014 plastic\n\nBond proceeds are also intended to push Pepsi toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain by 20% by 2030, from a 2015 baseline. By 2025, in high water-risk areas PepsiCo aims to replenish 100% of the water it consumes in its manufacturing operations and improve its operational water-use efficiency.\n\nPepsi\u2019s plastic moves were slow to come about, according to some sustainability advocates. As You Sow, which works on behalf of investors, had called out PepsiCo for its failure to increase U.S. bottle and can recycling rates after eight years of the advocacy group\u2019s lobbying for change.\n\nConrad MacKerron, a senior vice president with As You Sow, said in response to the Pepsi bond \u201c$1 billion or even a significant fraction of that could make a big impact. It was encouraging to see the company list sustainable plastics and packaging as the first issue in terms of how the green bond funds may be used.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cas we pointed out in this recent critique, $10 million donated by the company to the Recycling Partnership last year to help improve recycling infrastructure is woefully inadequate. Billions of dollars of investment are needed. In addition we also noted that several recycling experts stated that the U.S. bottle/can recycling rate would need to double to provide enough raw materials to meet the company\u2019s recently announced plans to increased recycled plastic content in its bottles,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all depends on how much they allocate and where it goes, but $500 million up to $1 billion of fresh capital could really start to make a significant impact to help increase recycling rates.\u201d\n\nPepsi is a signatory, along with consumer-products giant Unilever, which announced a major plastics initiative Monday, in an industry initiative called Loop, which looks primarily at ways to reduce packaging.\n\nRead: With refillable deodorant and naked products, Unilever thinks it can halve virgin plastic use by 2025\n\nGreen bond issuance has gained in the last decade, with new issuance this year alone expected to reach about $250 billion globally \u2014 a more than 20% increase from a year ago. That includes a $1.4 billion two-part offering from Netherlands-based TenneT Holding and the equivalent of a $2.2 billion three-part bond offering from China\u2019s Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.\n\n\u201cThat Pepsi is such a large, high-quality, and frequent issuer means that a lot of institutional investors invest in its bonds... so, we do think it helps lift the profile of green bonds overall. Investors certainly want to know more about what it means to issue a green bond, and what, if any, advantages there are to the issuer and what other motivations might exist,\u201d said CreditSight\u2019s Dunn.\n\nPepsi shares were lower in Tuesday trading. They\u2019re up 24% in the year to date.
