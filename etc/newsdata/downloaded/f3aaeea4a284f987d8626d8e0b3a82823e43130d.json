That slow pace is appealing to fans who want to take in a game while still keeping their hands busy.\n\n\u201cIf anything, it\u2019s a positive for someone who knits,\u201d Libby Butler-Gluck told the Times. \u201cWe sit for long periods of time and knit.\u201d\n\nPeople knitting at baseball games isn\u2019t a new phenomenon. Teams have hosted Stitch N\u2019 Pitch events since 2005. But as games drag on longer, more and more fans are feeling compelled to craft while they watch \u2014 something they don\u2019t necessarily do while watching other sports.\n\n\u201cI went to a football game, and I brought kitting and I did not touch it,\u201d Rachael McDaniel, the managing editor of The Hardball Times and a knitter, said. \u201cIt\u2019s also just that atmosphere of being at a baseball game. It\u2019s very different from being at a hockey arena, or basketball or football, where there\u2019s high energy and everybody is getting riled up all the time\u2026This style of baseball that I have grown attached to and devoted so much time to writing about \u2014 it allows me to pursue these other activities.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is supportive of the knitting trend, however. Victoria Pojrazov told the publication she gets comments from older men about her stitching during games. \u201cThey\u2019re maybe a little bit defensive of their turf,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, \u2018I don\u2019t think this girl knows baseball and isn\u2019t paying attention to it. Look at her knitting.\u2019 Some people think it\u2019s funny.\u201d\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at New York Times", "description": "With this season setting a new record for the average length of a game, Major League Baseball has been attracting a signficant number of knitters.", "authors": ["Bonnie Stiernberg"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-76760540.jpg?fit=1024%2C685", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
