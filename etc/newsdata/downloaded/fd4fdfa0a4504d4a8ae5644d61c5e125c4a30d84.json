He was working out in his mind how he would explain it to the press. After 11 years and nearing the end of his 124th match in charge, he was staring down the barrel of the end to his career as the Wales coach. He was oblivious to the thousands of fans streaming out of the stadium but even they will have heard his sigh of relief when Ross Moriarty\u2019s try was awarded with six minutes to go. It could have been heard for miles.\n\nWales come from behind to beat 14-man France in World Cup quarter-final Read more\n\nGatland wore the look a man who understood how close his side were to heading home and it would be no surprise if he afforded himself a stiff drink on Sunday night. \u201cYou start going through lots of emotions,\u201d he said, somewhat understatedly.\n\nHe had said seven days before, when it was confirmed Wales would be facing France at a World Cup for the first time since the 2011 semi-final, that he did not feel like he had finished with the tournament. He would have had to reconsider had the referee, Jaco Peyper, ultimately decided to rule out Moriarty\u2019s try. \u201cIronic,\u201d was Gatland\u2019s wry judgment when comparing this one-point victory in which a red card had been decisive with that meeting in Auckland eight years ago.\n\nWhen these sides last met, at the start of this year\u2019s Six Nations, Gatland\u2019s take was that his side had \u201cforgotten how to lose\u201d. They trailed by 16 points at half-time then, nine here, but this was the greater escape. And Gatland knew it.\n\nFor this was a rank Wales performance, totally outplayed by France, who contributed some delightful rugby. Gatland seemed not to care too much about that. He has made winning by any means necessary Wales\u2019s modus operandi and it must be considered a success that, leaving World Cup warm-up matches aside, they have won their last 19 matches.\n\nPlay Video 1:13 'The better team lost': Warren Gatland relieved after Wales squeeze past France \u2013 video\n\nPut simply, Gatland would have no qualms if Wales won all of their matches here 3-0. Shaun Edwards, his defence coach, who is set to join the France coaching staff after this tournament, would no doubt agree. For if Wales did anything well on Sunday, they scrambled in defence superbly. As Gatland said: \u201cCredit to these players, I\u2019m very proud of the fact that they don\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nHe pinpointed France\u2019s decision to kick at goal towards the end of the first half, with Wales nine points down, as the pivotal moment of the match. Romain Ntamack struck a post, Wales held out until the interval and France\u2019s swashbuckling fly-half did not emerge for the second half. He had been levelled just beforehand by Dan Biggar and it was George North\u2019s last-ditch tackle that stopped a certain try.\n\nWarren Gatland admits \u2018the better team lost\u2019 after Wales beat France Read more\n\nYou might think in a World Cup semi-final, defending well is a prerequisite. Wales cannot keep relying on a refusal to admit defeat but there is a growing body of evidence to suggest otherwise. The final four years ago was contested by the teams with the two best attacks but England and Wales have ensured there are two home nations in the final four for the first time since 1991 and they have done so by having the best defences.\n\nThere have been some pretty average attacking performances in those 19 victories \u2013 last autumn against Australia and over Scotland during this year\u2019s Six Nations spring to mind \u2013 but as Eddie Jones said before England booked their semi-final place: \u201cTournaments, and particularly a World Cup, is about a team sticking together. The rugby in a World Cup is pretty simple. You don\u2019t see brilliant rugby in World Cups. You see teams that are able to do things over and over again well \u2013 deal with the intensity, application, work hard for each other \u2013 that wins World Cups.\u201d\n\nThey do not always see eye to eye but you sense Gatland would agree with England\u2019s coach and as Gatland reminded us on Sunday: \u201cAlun Wyn Jones has been saying we are 240 minutes from doing something [memorable] for the rest of your life and we\u2019re down to 160 now, so if you can\u2019t get excited about that then nothing will excite you.\u201d\n\nWales, now into their third World Cup semi-final, have every right to be excited about Sunday\u2019s showdown with South Africa. First, however, they will have to wait for the relief to subside.", "description": "Gatland\u2019s side refused to buckle under intense France pressure which bodes well for their semi-final with South Africa", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86e273174d81e8e92e6349f875ad922581e66afe/0_137_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8276f957bdc580dc8199922e4e606448", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
