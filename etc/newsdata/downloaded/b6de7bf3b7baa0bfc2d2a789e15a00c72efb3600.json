The game was for us in 90 minutes very consistent.\n\n\u201cSome different players gave us the performance, also coming back after injuries of Holding, Kieran Tierney, Hector Bellerin.\n\n\u201cAnd I think it was a good match, a good result, a clean sheet, there are a lot of pleasing things and we can be positive with different options for the next matches.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about Smith Rowe, he added: \u201cIt was for a precaution we changed him. I\u2019m thinking he\u2019s not going to be a serious problem.\u201d\n\nEmery was also left purring at the performance of Martinelli, whose only previous appearance since joining from Brazilian club Ituano in the summer was a six-minute cameo at Newcastle on the opening weekend of the season.\n\n\u201cMartinelli is a very young player but he came here and we were waiting and watching him, how he could improve with us,\u201d said Emery.\n\n\u201cHe played very well. He was working each training with a big spirit and with a big performance.\n\n\u201cI spoke with him to have some patience to get his opportunity to play, to do like he was doing in training and in the matches in pre-season and tonight he did that and really he deserved it because he\u2019s a very humble player.\n\n\u201cHe fights, he is hungry to have that opportunity to help us and his work was perfect tonight.\u201d\n\nNottingham Forest boss Sabri Lamouchi, who suffered a first defeat since the opening weekend of the season, admitted his side were second best but felt the final scoreline flattered the hosts.\n\nForest, backed by almost 8,400 fans, managed only one attempt on target in 90 minutes in their first visit to Arsenal since a 2-1 top-flight loss in August 1998.\n\n\u201cWe deserved to lose but five, for me, is too much,\u201d said the Frenchman.\n\n\u201cYou play tonight against one of the best four, best six teams in the Premier League, top players. Nothing to add.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to Arsenal and good luck for the rest of this competition.\u201d", "description": "Unai Emery hailed Rob Holding\u2018s \u201cperfect\u201d return from long-term injury after Arsenal cruised into the Carabao Cup fourth round by hammering Nottingham Forest 5-0.
