The first videos were featured in a Times report about the Department of Defence operating a secret military program that researched unidentified aerial phenomena as recently as 2012.\n\nTTSAAS wrote in a blog post that the most recently released video was filmed from a F/A-18 Super Hornet in 2015. As the post states, the \u201cobject has no distinguishable flight surfaces or exhaust plume, and its flight seems to defy the known laws of physics.\u201d\n\nAt the time, a Pentagon spokesperson told Gizmodo that the U.S. Department of Defence would not provide comment on the footage.\n\nIn August John Greenwald, an independent researcher who runs The Black Vault, which hosts declassified government documents, requested information from the Navy about the three videos, titled \u201cFLIR1,\u201d \u201cGimbal,\u201d and \u201cGo Fast\u201d\n\nIn a response published on The Black Vault earlier this month, Deputy Chief of U.S. Naval Operations for Information Warfare spokesperson Joseph Gradisher told Greenwald, \u201cThe Navy designates the objects contained in these videos as unidentified aerial phenomena.\u201d\n\nGreenwald inquired about the Navy\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena\u201d rather than \u201cunidentified flying object\u201d and Gradisher reportedly explained, \u201cThe \u2018Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\u2019 terminology is used because it provides the basic descriptor for the sightings/observations of unauthorised/unidentified aircraft/objects that have been observed entering/operating in the airspace of various military-controlled training ranges.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Navy Office of Information did not immediately respond to our request for comment for this story. For a follow-up story on The Black Vault\u2019s reporting, Motherboard obtained an additional statement on the videos. Gradisher told Motherboard \u201cthe Navy considers the phenomena contained/depicted in those 3 videos as unidentified.\u201d\n\nGreenwald told Motherboard the use of the term \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena\u201d is significant because he expected the Navy would describe the objects as \u201cballoons\u201d or \u201cdrones\u201d \u2014 language the Pentagon has used in previously released official documents. \u201cHowever, they did not. They went on the record stating the \u2018phenomena\u2019 depicted in those videos, is \u2018unidentified,\u2019\u201d Greenwald told Motherboard. \u201cThat really made me surprised, intrigued, excited and motivated to push harder for the truth.\u201d\n\nIn April, the U.S. Navy announced it was drafting new guidelines for how service members should report unidentified aerial phenomena. The initiative reportedly aimed to streamline the process of documenting strange sightings and experiences.", "description": "Over a year after videos were released showing the public what appeared to be footage of UFOs captured by U.S. Navy pilots who exchanged astonished commentary, a Navy official has reportedly released a statement confirming that the videos do in fact depict \u201cunexplained aerial phenomena.\u201d...", "authors": ["James Whitbrook", "Jennings Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/zqseztlb0njdxpnmbrb5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
