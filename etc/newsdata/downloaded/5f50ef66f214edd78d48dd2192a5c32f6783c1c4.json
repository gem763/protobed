London tightens grip in forex trading", "language": "en", "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Financial analytics firm Mosaic Smart Data has doubled the number of developers and quantitative analysts it employs since 2018 at its London base, where nearly 40 now crunch numbers to help banks trade foreign exchange and bonds.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders looks at financial information on computer screens on the IG Index trading floor in London, Britain February 6, 2018. REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nFar from suffering under the economic and political uncertainty wrought by Britain\u2019s journey toward leaving the European Union, London is strengthening its grip on currency trading, the crown jewel of the city\u2019s financial industry.\n\nTechnological and regulatory trends little impacted by Brexit are driving more forex flows into a single, centralized trading hub, largely to London\u2019s benefit, interviews with bank executives, investors and central bank officials show.\n\nA boom in new financial technology jobs is helping London to offset a decline in traditional trading roles as the industry becomes ever more automated, though it may not compensate for Brexit-related losses in other financial sectors.\n\nLondon\u2019s share of global daily forex turnover has rocketed to a record 43% - from 37% in 2016 - as it stole market share from New York and Asian hubs, according to a Bank of International Settlements survey last month.\n\nLondon has long led in forex thanks to its convenient time zone and cutting-edge trading infrastructure.\n\nBut the news surprised many who had predicted Brexit would drive an exodus of banks and traders from London, or at least arrest its growth, while cities such as Hong Kong and Singapore were seen benefiting from a boom in local currency activity.\n\n\u201cLondon is hard to beat ... The depth and diversity of the skill pool here is unrivalled,\u201d Matthew Hodgson, the founder of Mosaic, one of a clutch of new fintech companies tapping into the forex industry, told Reuters.\n\nMosaic employed a handful of staff from a shared office around the time Britain voted to leave the EU.\n\n\u201cThere is a network effect for talent, the FX liquidity and the clustering of institutions,\u201d he said, predicting London\u2019s advantage was \u201clikely to have staying power\u201d despite Brexit.\n\n(GRAPHIC - Geographical distribution of OTC FX turnover: here)\n\nBig banks including Citi, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and UBS base their global forex heads in London.\n\nAnd some banks have expanded their presence in recent years.\n\nDutch bank ING, for instance, chose London to centralize its forex trading operations, previously scattered across various cities. ING\u2019s global forex and rates boss Gary Prince said it was efficient to run more business out of the British capital.\n\nLondon\u2019s forex fortunes could also be benefiting as European banks retrench from the United States, a recent HSBC report said.\n\nTRANSPARENCY\n\nThe BIS gives no explanation for London\u2019s increased share.\n\nSome traders caution that improved bank reporting of turnover - especially booming forex swap volumes - may have inflated the 2019 numbers globally, although that would not undermine London\u2019s success at the expense of rivals.\n\nPart of the story appears to be new regulations that require investors to justify the prices they get while trading.\n\nRules introduced in 2018 by the EU aim to bring forex trading more in line with equities and have seen a raft of new London-based firms launch to provide \u201ctransaction cost analysis\u201d to traders.\n\nTheir data, now used by 60% of buyside investors for currencies, according to Greenwich Associates, has reinforced what some market players already knew: trading costs are lowest when liquidity - the ease with which you can buy and sell - is deepest.\n\nAnd that\u2019s overwhelmingly when Asian and American time zones overlap with London.\n\nQuantifying intra-day liquidity is difficult without a single forex trading platform, but several traders said it had become easier and cheaper to transact in London than elsewhere.\n\nLarge investment funds can as much as halve execution costs when trading dollar/yen in London versus in Asia or New York, two senior traders told Reuters.\n\nAn extra bonus for the city is the increase in electronic trading and the use of computer models known as algorithms, or algos. Aimed at cutting costs and getting the best price, algos are often programmed to seek out the biggest liquidity pools.\n\n\u201cBecause London has the liquidity and because liquidity is what larger players are looking for across the spectrum, they are moving the time in which they transact to the most liquid time zones,\u201d said Itay Tuchman, London-based global head of forex at Citi.\n\n(GRAPHIC - OTC foreign exchange turnover: here)\n\nNEW JOBS?\n\nLondon\u2019s grip on the bank trading business is encouraging more forex fintechs to expand in the city. Often run by ex-bank traders and brokers, these startups offer a range of services, from data analysis to designing programs that can shave milliseconds off trading times.\n\nA City of London report said Britain\u2019s fintech sector employs an estimated 76,500 people, while London saw 61% growth in such jobs last year.\n\nSome of Britain\u2019s most valuable fintechs are in the forex industry, such as TransferWise and Revolut.\n\n\u201cThe network effect of having London as a talent hub to me is a very strong argument on why this city will dominate, even post-Brexit,\u201d Citi\u2019s Tuchman said.\n\nCurrencycloud, which builds forex payments infrastructure for businesses, has around three-fifths of its 250 staff in London and is expanding, its CEO Mike Laven told Reuters.\n\nBut is has also opened an office in Amsterdam and will employ 20 people there by the end of the year to help serve clients in the EU post-Brexit. These are jobs that \u201cwe would have hired in London,\u201d Laven said.\n\nLondon\u2019s forex dominance may not offset a broader employment hit in financial services from Brexit.\n\nThat\u2019s because the same trends that are encouraging more centralizing of trading are leading to forex automation and job cuts in the trading community.\n\nAt the world\u2019s 12 biggest investment banks, the number of trading and sales staff employed in bonds, forex and commodity globally was down to 1,400 by 2018 from 2,300 in 2010, analytics firm Coalition estimates.\n\nBut the draw of London remains strong, even for those who lose their jobs.\n\nWhen Peter Kinsella was told in 2017 by Commerzbank that it was shrinking teams and might move his forex strategy role from London to Frankfurt, he left the bank.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the best people in London and the best market information. You can get a call on a Monday and someone will ask what are you doing tomorrow morning? We\u2019ve got a meeting with a politician on Brexit,\u201d said Irishman Kinsella, who now advises well-heeled clients at Swiss bank Union Bancaire Privee - from London.\n\n\u201cThat type of connectivity you don\u2019t get in other parts of the world.\u201d", "description": "Financial analytics firm Mosaic Smart Data has doubled the number of developers and quantitative analysts it employs since 2018 at its London base, where nearly 40 now crunch numbers to help banks trade foreign exchange and bonds.", "authors": ["Tommy Wilkes", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439654418&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0X8", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
