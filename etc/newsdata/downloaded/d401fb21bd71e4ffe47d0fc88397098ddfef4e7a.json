(KOR)", "language": "en", "text": "HA HYUN-OCK\n\nThe author is a financial team head of the JoongAng Ilbo.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, the Pakistani government wanted to send a veteran diplomat who had served as ambassador to the United States and India to Saudi Arabia and asked for its agreement, but Saudi Arabia rejected it. Before the Saudi rejection, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain also refused. This diplomat could not get an agr\u00e9ment from Arab countries. Pakistan later found out that his name was vulgar in Arabic and these countries did not want to receive him as a Pakistani ambassador.\n\n\n\n\u201cAgr\u00e9ment\u201d refers to seeking agreement of the receiving country before sending a diplomatic mission. It was defined in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 in order to prevent international conflict from a country rejecting an officially appointed diplomat from another country. The person who receives an agr\u00e9ment is called a persona grata. In contrast, a person who did not get an agr\u00e9ment is called a persona non grata.\n\n\n\nAt the National Assembly Foreign and Unification Committee interpellation session on Oct. 4, the delayed agr\u00e9ment by the U.S. government on Korean Ambassador to the U.S. designee Lee Soo-hyuck became a controversy. Since the designation was announced on Aug. 9, 56 days have passed, and agr\u00e9ment is yet to come. The opposition party claimed that Washington was expressing discontent about Korea\u2019s ending of the General Security of Military Information Agreement (Gsomia) with Japan in a roundabout way and showed concern about cracks in the alliance.\n\n\n\nIt is an exaggeration to interpret the delayed agr\u00e9ment as an offshoot of the Moon Jae-in administration\u2019s \u201cGsomia non grata.\u201d It would be fortunate if only administrative procedure takes time. But it is a different matter if it is another warning sign of Korea-U.S. relations. Rather, I would prefer the ambassador\u2019s name to hinder the agr\u00e9ment.\n\n\n\nJoongAng Ilbo, Oct. 7, Page 31", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
