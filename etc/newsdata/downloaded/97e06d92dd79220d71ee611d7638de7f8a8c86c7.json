Well, it depends. Although the spread between the U.S. 10-year and 3-month Treasuries has normalized somewhat in September, it remained in negative territory. Meanwhile, after a short dip below zero in August, the spread between the U.S. 10-year and 2-year Treasuries spent time in positive territory, as the chart below shows.\n\nChart 1: Spread between US 10-year and 3-month Treasuries (blue line, daily numbers, in %) and spread between US 10-year and 2-year Treasuries (green line, daily numbers, in %) from January 2019 to September 2019\n\nWhich spread should we trust? The literature says that the best results are obtained empirically by taking the difference between two Treasury yields whose maturities are far apart. Using the three-month Treasury rate (the overnight rate) at the short end is appropriate. When used in combination with the ten-year Treasury rate to predict U.S. recessions, it provides a reasonable combination of accuracy and robustness over long time periods. Thus, the U.S. yield curve has been inverted since mid-May, which constitutes a powerful recessionary signal. Indeed, that signal has been recently (at the turn of August and September) strengthened by the short-lived dive of the spread between 30-year Treasuries and 3-month below zero.\n\nIf history is any guide, we should expect a recession next year, possibly even before the presidential elections. Buy some gold, lots of popcorn, sit and watch \u2013 it will be fun! Now, a very important thing: this scenario is not written in stone. History does not repeat itself, it only rhymes. So please be aware that the recession may came a bit earlier or later, or it may even decide not to arrive. It would be unlikely, but we cannot exclude it. The yield curve is the most reliable recessionary indicator we have, but it\u2019s not a crystal ball, it\u2019s just an indicator, man!\n\nTo use any indicator wisely, we need to understand the broader context. We need more data and a proper background. We need to know the ultimate reasons behind the yield curve inversion. As one can see in the chart below, although the U.S. long-term bond yields have decreased substantially since the end of 2019, the main reason behind the yield curve inversion has been the steady rise in the short-term interest rates that started at the end of 2015.\n\nChart 2: US 10-year Treasury yields (green line) and US 3-month Treasury yields (blue line) from January 2015 to September 2019.", "description": "By now, everyone and their brother has heard about The yield curve invertedsion.
