Across 17 stories, not including dozens of spinoffs, Link\u2019s adventures are often milestones for the industry as they\u2019re often test beds for new concepts. Ranking them can go many ways, but here\u2019s the very loose criteria we used:\n\nHow has the game aged?: Great games, like \u201cTetris,\" stand the test of time despite technological advances. Considering how well some of the older titles still hold up, I\u2019d say this is a fair question.\n\nGreat games, like \u201cTetris,\" stand the test of time despite technological advances. Considering how well some of the older titles still hold up, I\u2019d say this is a fair question. What was the game\u2019s impact?: Influence holds weight too. Sometimes innovation is that game\u2019s legacy. Even if those innovations are outdated, Zelda DNA lives on throughout the industry.\n\nInfluence holds weight too. Sometimes innovation is that game\u2019s legacy. Even if those innovations are outdated, Zelda DNA lives on throughout the industry. Overall design and structure: Pacing, map design and Link\u2019s tools are the meat of each game. These are ancillary aspects that all support the three pillars of puzzles, exploration and combat. How well are the tools used in the maps and dungeons? Is the world fun to explore? Are there roadblocks to enjoyment or progress?\n\nMany fans will probably disagree with this list, or the reasoning, and that\u2019s okay. At the very baseline, all these games are at least very good. Let us know in the comments below what you think, and let\u2019s chat about the merits of each title. I\u2019ll be reading every comment and discussing with the rest of you.\n\n17. Tri Force Heroes (2015)\n\nZelda games by their nature are solitary adventures. \u201cTri Force Heroes\u201d was a game that catered to the niche market of people who have two friends that were down to play Zelda and owned a Nintendo 3DS. If you only had one other such friend, you\u2019re out of luck. It was good for a laugh, but besides the branding, it\u2019s barely considered a Zelda game if not for Nintendo\u2019s insistence that it remains in the canon. One redeeming factor: Link\u2019s new costumes were great.\n\n16. Skyward Sword (2011)\n\nThis is the only Zelda game I never finished. It\u2019s not because I wasn\u2019t good enough. In fact, I made it all the way to the final phase of the last enemy.\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t the motion controls, which worked fine at the time. But the game\u2019s legacy is soiled by the fact it\u2019s impossible to play without a Wii remote, a method of play as outdated as watching \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\u2019s Chest\u201d on your iPod. To release the game again today is to remake it entirely from the ground up.\n\nWhat was the breaking point? There were several:\n\nThere were the constant gameplay interruptions from companion Fi (a comprehensive fan audit states the player is interrupted by hand-holding 162 times throughout the game, vs. only 87 in \u201cOcarina of Time\u201d). Then there was the constant reusing of the same areas. There was the imprecise \u201cdousing\u201d mechanic ... the repeated collecting of \u201ctears\u201d in a ghost realm that made me feel like I was playing Depressed Pac-Man ... or maybe it was the enemy design, which relied on trial and error trickery rather than actual mastery of the motion controls.\n\nThe risks of \u201cSkyward\u201d were admirable, but didn\u2019t pay off, and ended in the worst Zelda console game ever made \u2014 a narrow distinction that keeps it out of the 17 spot.\n\nJust before defeating the final enemy, I turned off my Wii and immediately went to YouTube to watch the ending. For me, the Link of \u201cSkyward Sword\u201d met his demise, and never won.\n\n\n\n\"Skyward Sword\" is the worst of the main \"Zelda\" stories.\n\n15. Four Swords Adventures (2005)\n\nIt\u2019s another multiplayer spinoff that\u2019s counted as a main game. This time, though, there\u2019s a story that\u2019s actually relevant to the series lore (if you\u2019re into that sort of thing), and the extra hardware isn\u2019t necessary. You can play this by yourself, and with any number of friends up to four players. If you caught this during the GameCube heyday, it\u2019s likely a jolly good memory.\n\n14. The Adventure of Link (1988)\n\nAmbitious and messy, the only numbered Zelda sequel was our first clue Nintendo had no fear deviating from past success. It changed perspectives, it changed the core gameplay and of all the games on this list, it\u2019s probably the closest the series ever became to becoming a traditional \u201crole-playing game\u201d with experience points to boost Link\u2019s powers. Those things were implemented fairly well into the character, but let\u2019s face it, those levels and enemies relied on cheap hits, and were poorly designed. Miyamoto himself said it\u2019s probably the closest thing he\u2019s ever made to a \u201cbad\u201d game.\n\n13. Phantom Hourglass (2007)\n\nYou\u2019re going to see a lot of the handheld games near the bottom of the list, mostly because they were eventually relegated to the same \u201cwild experiments\u201d philosophy \u201cThe Adventure of Link\u201d had. They were cheaper, lower risk, but they could play with formula. \u201cPhantom Hourglass\u201d was a direct \u201cWind Waker\u201d sequel, and retains much of its charm. But you play the game via the Nintendo DS stylus. As we learned with \u201cSkyward Sword,\u201d if there\u2019s a new way to control Link, hundreds of overbearing tutorials aren\u2019t far behind. And as a result, the dungeons were elementary at best, and some of the worst in the series.\n\n12. Spirit Tracks (2009)\n\nThe handheld sequel to \u201cPhantom,\u201d this brought back challenging and complex dungeons, while retaining the \u201cWind Waker\u201d aesthetic and lore. Too many roadblocks and too much side-quest friction between dungeons keep this from being truly great, but it was a better second effort for the Nintendo DS.\n\n11. Twilight Princess (2006)\n\nReviewing this game was my first instance where I felt the heat of an \u201conline mob.\" I gave \u201cTwilight Princess\u201d the lowest score on Metacritic, underneath a tower of perfect scores (one site later gave it a lower score, and the game is still the third-most-acclaimed game on the Wii). I gave the game an 8 out of 10, so of course I was met with racist, anti-Semitic (I\u2019m Korean) vitriol. Read it here, as I still stand by much of what I said. It falls shy of greatness because it\u2019s the only Zelda with no new ideas for the series.\n\nAnd yet, when I revisited the game in its HD remaster on the Wii U, I liked it better. I would still give it an 8 out of 10, and all my criticisms about the shallow wolf mechanic and routine dungeon formula still hold. But as rote as the dungeons are, they\u2019re some of the most creative the series ever made (the unforgettable yeti love story of Snowpeak Mansion is the standout). Midna is also arguably the best written and most entertaining of Link\u2019s sidekicks. Of all the 3-D Zelda games, \u201cTwilight\u201d is the tightest. Yes it feels old, but all the pieces still fit and work like they should.\n\n\n\nThe best and worst things about \"Twilight Princess\" in one photo.\n\n10. The Legend of Zelda (1986)\n\nMany other games, let alone this series, wouldn\u2019t exist without the first \u201cZelda,\" released in 1986. Zelda was the first game to be so epic, they invented battery saving for it. It is the nucleus of all modern role-playing games, as well as several other games including the \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d series. Its go-anywhere, do-anything design principles still hold strong to this day (as we\u2019ll see later in this list), but it generally isn\u2019t an essential play. This game belongs in the Smithsonian, but not atop any Zelda rankings.\n\n9. The Minish Cap (2004)\n\nOften ignored in \u201cbest of\u201d discussions, \u201cMinish\u201d was the last of the Capcom Zelda tryouts. Rather than try to emulate the \u201cToon Link\u201d style the later DS titles utilized, \u201cMinish\u201d went for one that adapted the pixel art of the classic games, and it was better for it. Beyond that, the game had some of the series\u2019 best items, most notably a gliding cape. Link can also shrink. Capcom understood one fact about life: the smaller you are, the bigger the world seems.\n\n8. Oracle of Ages/Oracle of Seasons (2000)\n\nThese two games are essentially one. You can\u2019t complete one story without the other. And although Capcom created this game during the height of the Pok\u00e9mon trend of releasing two different versions of the same game, they went above and beyond by creating separate stories and worlds. A decision in one game would affect the other. And the games were allowed to focus on one of the two pillars of Zelda: Seasons focused on combat with interesting enemy designs and some of the most memorable boss encounters in the series, while Ages gave us some of the most compelling puzzle dungeons in the 2D format.\n\n7. Ocarina of Time (1998)\n\nWhen released, \u201cOcarina\u201d was heralded as the \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d of gaming. This wasn\u2019t hyperbole from a fledgling industry who longed for artistic affirmation, it was immediate acknowledgment of the game\u2019s many innovations. To this day, any game that allows movement in a 3-D space owes a debt to the Nintendo 64\u2032s greatest games (alongside \u201cSuper Mario 64\u201d).\n\nAge has obscured even the most famous innovations, masking their genius from later generations. Combat is mostly just a waiting game (as infamously explained in YouTuber Arin Hanson\u2019s takedown). And time (and games like \u201cTwilight Princess\u201d) exposed some creakiness in the game\u2019s insistence to funnel you through the experience, rather than enhancing the \u201cexploration\u201d pillar of Zelda adventures. Just as \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d now looks antiquated alongside modern films, so does this game. But time has proved to be no master to either\u2019s enduring legacies.\n\n\n\n\"Ocarina of Time\" forever changed the way players navigate three-dimensional space in video games. (Nintendo/Nintendo)\n\n6. A Link Between Worlds (2013)\n\nIt could\u2019ve been the perfect Zelda overhead adventure, if not for Nintendo\u2019s brash courage: It retooled the winning formula of a large chunk of the series to let the player become as capable as they wanted right at the beginning of the game. Every item, every power could be available from the start. You could tackle any dungeon, which blew the doors wide open for exploration and player experimentation.\n\nThe only problem? Every dungeon is equal in difficulty, a necessary design choice given how the players can explore the entire world at their own pace. The game is better for it. A rewarding sense of progress is somewhat diminished, but only when compared to the rest of the games on this list.\n\n5. Wind Waker (2003)\n\nThis was a new commitment to re-examine why the first Zelda is so beloved and influential. Islands loom in the distance, all invitations for adventure and treasure. It was a new 3-D world to explore, and at the time, sailing in video games was a rarity. Yet, here was Nintendo making it as simple as it was exciting. The story is a series best, casting the villainous Ganondorf as a tragic victim of circumstance.\n\nThe game is held back by faults Nintendo has openly acknowledged: dungeons at the end that feel unfinished, and an exhausting, ill-advised fetch quest that was included to pad the game out. The latter was the greater sin, and it was wisely scaled back for the Wii U remaster. That\u2019s about an hour or two of grief at the tail end of an entirely joyful experience that\u2019s easy to revisit today.\n\n\n\nThe cel-shaded cartoon aesthetic of \"Wind Waker\" drew one of the first online outrage controversies of the millennium.\n\n4. A Link to the Past (1992)\n\nJust about every Zelda game stands in this game\u2019s shadow, even the two before it. As a 10-year-old boy, when I saw the rain and thunder claps backed by music filled with timpani drums and MIDI violins, it was how I imagine what boomers felt when they first heard \u201cPet Sounds.\" I didn\u2019t know this could be done in games. They could dare to be this beautiful?\n\nBeyond sight and sound, \u201cLink to the Past\u201d established the most tried-and-true of Zelda formulas: Two or more connected worlds, with at least eight dungeons, each holding a special tool to use, all accessed by a big key. \u201cOcarina of Time\u201d is basically this game in 3-D. And even if this formula would eventually constrain the creativity of the series, it only speaks to the timelessness of the structure. This isn\u2019t just a single title in an influential series. It\u2019s a textbook template for other games to build upon. And as we\u2019ll see in the next entry, even Nintendo saw opportunity in their own work.\n\n3. Link\u2019s Awakening (1993)\n\nThis was always going to be third on the list, regardless of the Nintendo Switch release this week. Inspired by \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d it was also the first game to divert from the \u201csave Princess Zelda\u201d formula to offer a trippy patchwork of Nintendo tropes like side-scrolling levels with Mario\u2019s Piranha Plants and a lonely SimCity mayor getting catfished by a goat.\n\nItems like the feather that made Link jump could be used in the \u201coverworld\u201d map, not just the dungeons in which they were found. The overworld didn\u2019t just exist to connect the eight dungeons, it was its own massive world to explore, with its own strange puzzle rooms and keys. The original Game Boy release was hampered only by its two-button limits. Switching out Link\u2019s many items became a chore. With the Switch release, the only big flaw of \u201cLink\u2019s Awakening\u201d is gone, and now it\u2019s more beautiful than ever. Even though \u201cLink to the Past\u201d built the template, \u201cLink\u2019s Awakening\u201d filled it with its own unforgettable identity. It is the perfect 2D Zelda game.\n\n\n\nA comparison of \"Link's Awakening\" for the Game Boy Color (1993) and Nintendo Switch (2019), screencapped from YouTube channel GameXplain.\n\n2. Majora\u2019s Mask (2000)\n\nExistential and tragic. \u201cMajora\u2019s Mask\u201d is the boldest game on this list. It\u2019s entire story hinges on a doomsday clock of 72 hours until the moon destroys the world. It\u2019s thanks to the Skull Kid, a lonely boy who was lost in the woods for too long and happened upon a cursed mask that fed on his loneliness.\n\nBeyond the story, the game takes the groundhog day concept and turns it into a puzzle to be solved over and over again. The game only has four dungeons, but each need several leaps back and forth within those three days to solve. Each of the puzzles reset every time you start the time loop over, which means more pressure than Link\u2019s ever seen in his adventures. Space and time crash into each other in the final Stone Tower dungeon, which must be beaten normally and then upside down.\n\nBy wearing masks that let him swim through water like a missile or become a literal god, Link is more capable and powerful than he\u2019s ever been. And Clock Town feels more alive than most cities in games today. Every denizen has a daily routine they follow. They rise, go to work and see secret lovers.\n\nThe game is heavy on story, but leaves so much to the player\u2019s interpretation of it. And there\u2019s its tragic final note when the credits roll, showing the one character Link couldn\u2019t save. Even when Link has all the time in the world, it\u2019s never enough.\n\n\n\nThe Skull Kid wearing Majora's mask is the most tragic of Link's villains.\n\n1. Breath of the Wild (2017)\n\nIf \u201cLink to the Past\u201d set the blueprint for a huge chunk of the series, this is the only game to sidestep it completely. It draws inspiration from another: the original game. Like in the original, Link is given only a few moments to gather himself before he\u2019s able to travel in any direction the player pleases, even toward the dark castle and the game\u2019s final battle.\n\nThe game was created with a singular vision: To recapture Miyamoto\u2019s original intent of exploration purely led by the player\u2019s own curiosity and imagination. Every aspect in this game\u2019s design is in service of player freedom. It\u2019s rare to see any pop culture franchise be so committed to rediscovering itself that it\u2019s willing to upend every single aspect of its winning formula, but Nintendo did that here to wild success.\n\nThe trust it puts in the player\u2019s imagination has helped players form their own special relationship to it. The game\u2019s physics engine is so unpredictable that to this day the \u201cBreath\u201d community continues to find new tricks to navigate Nintendo\u2019s biggest game ever. Many fans report that it has helped them deal with depression and anxiety. Other game developers are currently studying it to figure out how exactly Nintendo created a \u201ckiller app\u201d so compelling that for many, it became the sole reason for customers to invest in the new hardware.\n\nIt\u2019s the game that further cemented Nintendo\u2019s legacy as the best creators of the craft, and the series as an industry flagship.\n\n\n\nThe \"Breath of the Wild\" opening sequence still captivates three years later.\n\nDisagree with the list?
