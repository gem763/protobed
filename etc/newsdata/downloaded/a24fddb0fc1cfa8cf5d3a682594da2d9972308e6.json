Riders will pay for the privilege of taking their pets with them through what Uber describes as a \u201csmall surcharge.\u201d And drivers will have the option of avoiding trips with non-service animals by opting out of Uber Pet trips in the driver preferences menu in the app.\n\nUber says it will pay drivers \u201ca significant portion of that surcharge,\u201d on top of their standard trip earnings.\n\nThe company emphasized that Uber Pet does not replace their service animal policy. Riders with service animals are not expected or required to use Uber Pet, and can select from any number of ride options without paying the surcharge.\n\nInstead, Uber Pet was designed for riders who are pet or non-service animal owners. Uber expects cats and dogs will be the most common animals on Uber Pet trips.\n\nUber Pet is another example of the company making efforts to become the app behind every aspect of its users\u2019 lives, namely through transportation and meal delivery. Uber unveiled last month a number of changes across its products designed to achieve that very goal.\n\n\u201cWe want to be the operating system for your everyday life,\u201d CEO Dara Khosrowshahi at the time. \u201cA one-click gateway to everything that Uber can offer you.\u201d", "description": "Uber is piloting a new feature that lets U.S. riders alert drivers that a pet will be coming along, the latest effort from the company to appeal to a broader audience and become the one-stop shop for transportation, meals and other services.
