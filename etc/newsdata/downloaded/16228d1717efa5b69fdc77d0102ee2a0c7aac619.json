This is the reason for their persistence in the environment, according to the study published in the journal Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) Advances.\n\nDon't Miss 11.8 K SHARES 376 SHARES 359 SHARES 365 SHARES 2.7 K SHARES\n\nThe exponential production and consumption of polystyrene in various sectors has presented a great environment risk and raised the problem of waste management, the researchers noted.\n\n\"Our data support the fact that strains of extremophile bacterium Exiguobacterium are capable of degrading polystyrene and can be further used to mitigate the environmental pollution caused by plastics,\" said Richa Priyadarshini, associate professor at Shiv Nadar University.\n\n\"Wetlands are one of the richest habitats of microbial diversity but are relatively unexplored. Hence, these ecosystems are ideal grounds for isolating bacteria with novel biotechnological applications,\" said Priyadarshini, who discovered the bacteria strains along with her team at the Department of Life Sciences, School of Natural Sciences.\n\nAccording to industry estimates, India consumes about 16.5 million metric tonnes of plastic annually.\n\nThe All India Plastic Manufacturers Association (AIPMA) estimates that the plastic industry produces about 14 million metric tonnes of polystyrene, which is non-biodegradable. This effects both terrestrial and marine life, e.g. a plastic fork can take up to 450 years or more to decompose, the researchers noted.\n\nIn the universe of plastic items used daily, single use plastics (SUP) constitutes about a fifth in volume, they said.\n\nThe finding assumes significance in India given the recent announcement by the Prime Minister to eliminate SUP by 2022.\n\nThe research team identified that upon coming into contact with the plastic (polystyrene), the two isolated bacteria strains use it as a carbon source, and create biofilms.\n\nThis alters the physical properties of polystyrene, and initiates a process of natural degradation with the release of hydrolysing enzymes to break the polymer chains.\n\n\"Biodegradation is a process by which microbial organisms -- mainly bacteria and fungi -- transform or degrade chemicals introduced into the environment,\" Priyadarshini said.\n\nThe team is currently trying to evaluate the metabolic processes of these strains for utilisation in environmental bioremediation.\n\nThe researchers note that the use of both indigenous and genetically modified bacteria could lead to eco-friendly alternative clean-up methods for plastic waste.\n\nFurther research should be directed towards making these process faster, sustainable and cost-effective, they said.\n\nWith Inputs From PTI", "description": "The bacterial strains discovered by researchers at Shiv Nadar University in Greater Noida have the potential to decompose polystyrene -- a key component in single-use plastic (SUP) items such as disposable cups, cutlery, toys and packaging materials.", "authors": ["Saket Suman"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/plastic_1570947680_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
