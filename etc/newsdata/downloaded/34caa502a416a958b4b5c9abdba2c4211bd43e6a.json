She and her boyfriend, presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker, attended the premiere together last week, even sharing a kiss on the red carpet.\n\nHe's excited about the sequel and rewatched the first movie before the premiere, Dawson says. \"He was like, 'I just want to be caught up.' ... (He tried) to get information out of me, but I wouldn't tell him anything.\"\n\nThe couple confirmed in March that they're dating. Dawson and Booker are usually very private in their personal lives but have been more open about their relationship.\n\nHe's alive!

I'm so grateful that he's still with us and still creating, and now he's talking about doing a 'Clerks III.' I just love working with him.\"\n\nShe has an animated film coming this month: Dawson again lends her voice to Diana Prince/Wonder Woman in \"Wonder Woman: Bloodlines\" (available in digital HD, arrives Oct. 22 on Blu-ray), her first solo animated movie.\n\nShe voiced Wonder Woman in several digitally released DC Comics animated movies, including \"Justice League Dark\" and \"Reign of the Supermen.\"\n\n\"To have a character like (Wonder Woman) that's been shared and loved and evolved over generations ... someone powerful and dynamic and interesting that we can all look up to and be inspired by \u2013 and to be a part of that storytelling \u2013 it's just an honor,\" she says.\n\nCory Booker and Rosario Dawson walked the \"Zombieland: Double Tap\" carpet hand in hand.

She had like the No. 1 Superman, she had all the number ones and was really obsessed with it.\"\n\nDawson's uncle, Gustavo Vazquez, became a comic book artist who has worked for Marvel and DC.\n\nRosario Dawson discusses \"Wonder Woman: Bloodlines\" at New York Comic Con on Oct. 4.

Aside from Wonder Woman, \"I always loved the Joker and Harley Quinn, personally, growing up,\" Dawson says.\n\nShe's especially proud of the growing diversity and inclusion in comic books and superhero movies and shows.\n\n\"I'm just grateful that (comic books) are getting the respect and care and space that (they) deserve,\" she says. \"Because it's been a hugely impactful genre in my life \u2013 things I've gotten to work on or act in and voice but also just indulge in and escape with and enjoy with my family for many years.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/16/rosario-dawson-talks-cory-booker-wonder-woman-kevin-smith-zombieland/3957054002/", "description": "Rosario Dawson chats about her latest films (including \"Zombieland 2\"), her relationship with Cory Booker and what it's like working with Kevin Smith.", "authors": ["Felecia Wellington Radel", "Published P.M.
