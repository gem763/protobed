Ben Sasse, R-Neb., has described as a \u201cpartisan clown show\u201d \u2013 you have to ask yourself: What are the Democrats afraid of?\n\nIf they had a good case, the Democrats would be proudly putting it out in the open so all Americans could learn the facts that would convince them to support impeaching the duly elected president of the United States.\n\nIn fact, the Democrats seem to have a pathetic case that keeps falling apart.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: THE RESISTANCE AGAINST TRUMP BEGAN THE DAY HE WAS ELECTED -- THIS IS NOT AN IMPEACHMENT PROCESS\n\nAfter the Mueller investigation failed to find President Trump guilty, the Democrats could have turned to legislating and fighting over real issues, like health care.\n\nAfter all, in 1998 we were faced with Independent Counsel Ken Starr\u2019s report, which charged that President Bill Clinton was guilty on 11 counts including perjury, which is a felony.\n\nIf Mueller\u2019s report had used the word \u201cguilty\u201d 11 times the Republicans would have been forced to join in a serious investigation of the president.\n\nHowever, when Mueller did not use the word \u201cguilty\u201d even once, the need for an investigation ended.\n\nThen, as the Democrats squirmed under the attacks of their activists who were determined that President Trump should be impeached just for being President Trump, they found a new excuse to investigate.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. \u2013 who was consistently dishonest and wrong for two years of Russian collusion stories \u2013 suddenly had a whistleblower who was anti-Trump.\n\nThe Democrats were ecstatic. They now had an excuse to make their hardcore, left-wing, anti-Trump partisans happy.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was so eager to appease the left that she announced the investigation before Democrats even had the whistleblower\u2019s report and before they had seen the transcript of President Trump\u2019s phone call with the new, reform-focused Ukrainian president.\n\nThe whistleblower was going to be the centerpiece of the case against Trump. Except it turned out he had met with Schiff\u2019s people before submitting his letter. Then it turned out he had no firsthand knowledge of the items he was complaining about.\n\nThen it turned out there were a number of factual falsehoods in the letter. Then it turned out the whistleblower was a Democrat who disliked Trump. Then it turned out he had worked with then-Vice President Joe Biden in the White House.\n\nNow there are reports that after five different disclosures undermining the whistleblower\u2019s credibility, the House Democrats may not even call him to testify.\n\nThis means that the person who was the excuse for the whole investigation is now so discredited that House Democrats know he would be an embarrassment and would make even more of a mockery of their phony impeachment effort.\n\nIn some ways, the collapse of the whistleblower is reminiscent of the collapse of the attacks on now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Big opening smear, wildly hostile headlines, excited anti-Trump talking heads, and then the balloon loses air, the case collapses and it is on to the next dishonest smear.\n\nThe secret nature of the Schiff kangaroo court really means we know nothing for certain about any of the witnesses or their testimony.\n\nConsider the case of Bill Taylor, a very reputable senior diplomat who is now the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nAs Marc Thiessen reported: \u201cCellphones are not permitted inside a SCIF. Yet somehow what appear to be cellphone photos of his prepared statement were leaked to the news media.\n\nMARC THIESSEN: DEMOCRATS NOT SERIOUS ABOUT TRUMP IMPEACHMENT \u2013 INQUIRY IS ALL ABOUT POLITICS\n\nThiessen added: \u201cBut the full transcript of Taylor\u2019s deposition \u2013 including his answers to questions from Republicans challenging his accusations \u2013 remains under lock and key in that SCIF. The president\u2019s counsel is not allowed to see it, much less be present at the deposition to cross-examine the witness. So, Democrats are leaking derogatory information about the president, while restricting public access to potentially exculpatory information, all while denying him the right to see or challenge testimony against him.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 partisan impeachment inquiry is an un-American, unconstitutional process that violates the due process clause of the Bill of Rights\n\nYet despite the selective leaks by the Democrats, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said that \"in 90 seconds, we had John Ratcliffe [R-Texas] destroy Taylor's whole argument.\u201d\n\nYet McCarthy was gagged by the Democrats\u2019 secrecy rules. \"We can't really talk about it,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nRatcliffe flatly told Fox News there were new details brought to light but said there was nothing that was \"worthy of impeachment.\"\n\nRatcliffe went on to say: \"The one thing that you find out in this process is all this information is just like that whistleblower ... everything is second-, third-, and fourth-hand information.\u201d\n\nREP. RATCLIFFE: DURHAM PROBE, IG REPORT WILL 'VINDICATE' THOSE WHO QUESTIONED TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 partisan impeachment inquiry is an un-American, unconstitutional process that violates the due process clause of the Bill of Rights. As we see in Iowa, accused murderers who are illegal immigrants are being granted more protection of their right to due process than the president of the United States.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEvery House Democrat must be made to bear the burden of supporting this kangaroo court \u201cpartisan clown show.\u201d\n\nEvery House Democrat should be asked: \u201cWhat are you afraid of that you can\u2019t let the American people see the facts and decide for themselves?\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY NEWT GINGRICH", "description": "Every House Democrat must be made to bear the burden of supporting this kangaroo court \u201cpartisan clown show.\u201d Every House Democrat should be asked: \u201cWhat are you afraid of that you can\u2019t let the American people see the facts and decide for themselves?\u201d", "authors": ["Newt Gingrich", "Former Speaker Of The U.S. House Of Representatives Newt Gingrich Is The Host Of The"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/22/694940094001_6096812725001_6096814433001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
