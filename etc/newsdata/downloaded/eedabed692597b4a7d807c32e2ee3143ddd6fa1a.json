Without them, a show is rendered completely unbelievable, but with them they catapult our imaginations to a particular time and place, leaving behind a legacy in the process.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Villanelle\u2019s pink dress in Killing Eve or Ugly Betty\u2019s poncho, there\u2019s usually always more than meets the eye and a whole world of tiny details that escape unnoticed.\n\nEach week Back Into The Closet will deliver an exclusive look into the wardrobes of some of the world\u2019s leading series to bring you all the costume secrets and niceties we might have missed.\n\nLast time we caught up Good Omens costume designer Claire Anderson, but today we\u2019re delving through all the looks that graced the Netflix satire The Politician, courtesy of Claire Parkinson.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Georgina and Ben Platt\u2019s Payton are *very* in sync with their looks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPayton (Ben Platt) is besotted by his adopted mother Georgina (Gwyneth Paltrow) so much so that if you pay close attention she often dresses in the same colours as him.\n\n\u2018Gwyneth and Payton have a very similar colour palette,\u2019 Claire told us. \u2018Sometimes she\u2019ll wear red and he\u2019ll wear a striking red too.\n\n\u2018They very much care about the world and how they want to be perceived but also for humankind.\u2019\n\nWe love to see it.\n\nBarack Obama, Princess Diana and David Bowie were all influences\n\nSame same, but different (Picture: Netflix/Getty)\n\nThe costume department was inspired by some pretty big names for the show, including the likes of Princess Diana and Barack Obama.\n\nPayton\u2019s lookbook consisted of classic Obama and John F. Kennedy outfits, with Claire explaining: \u2018It was all about his character being idealistic and presidential.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s very deliberate with what he wears. Yes, it\u2019s high-school but it\u2019s also a satire that he wears a suit almost every day or a nice beautiful sweater in a monochromatic look.\n\n\u2018When I met with Ryan Murphy [director of The Politician], he was inspired by Robert Redford\u2019s character in The Candidate too. We also took from JFK and Obama.\u2019\n\nServing Princess Di realness (Picture: Netflix/Getty)\n\nMeanwhile, Payton\u2019s girlfriend Alice (Julia Schlaepfer) borrowed from perhaps two of the biggest female powerhouses of all time.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s very presentational and deliberate with her looks and it\u2019s very Jackie Kennedy and Princess Di,\u2019 Claire said. \u2018We were aiming for that 80s preppy look and we love those sherbet colours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She\u2019s always wearing pearls and she always has a handbag. You\u2019ll see her sat in the audience and she\u2019ll be sat clutching her purse.\u2019\n\nWe can\u2019t cope with the coolness (Picture: Netflix/Getty)\n\nOn the other hand, McAfee\u2019s (Laura Dreyfuss) wardrobe was more punk rock and took from David Bowie and feminist icons.\n\n\u2018She has a lot of wealth and her way of showing it is wearing strong and vibrant suits,; Claire noted. \u2018We wanted her to be very much a feminist and she\u2019s very inspired by strong powerful women but also strong powerful men like David Bowie.\u2019\n\nIncredible.\n\nYou can tell the twins apart by their hair\n\nLuther is on the left, Martin is on the right (Picture: Netflix)\n\nThe best way to Martin (Trevor Mahlon Eason) and Luther (Trey Eason as Luther) apart is by their hair.\n\n\u2018The thing you can notice with the twins is that one has higher hair,\u2019 Claire revealed before adding that she\u2019s not sure which one has the biggest quiff.\n\nMartin has the most voluminous barnet, btw.\n\n\u2018Otherwise, they\u2019re so similar and their clothing was deliberately matching in a colour tone way.\n\n\u2018I always had one wearing shorts and the other in pants, or one wearing burgundy pants and the other is wearing a burgundy top.\n\n\u2018Even when they dress up their colour palette, it\u2019s always the same and they\u2019re pretty much wearing Ralph Lauren head to toe.\u2019\n\nAstrid wears a red ruby ring and it means a lot\n\nLook closely and you\u2019ll notice that Astrid (Lucy Boynton) is pretty much always wearing a ruby ring \u2013 and it foreshadows her journey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Astrid is always wearing a red ruby ring, it\u2019s like her being tied to her wealth,\u2019 Claire told us.\n\n\u2018She has a strong voice and she shows it in what she says but also has a lot of money and she tries to get away from it.\n\n\u2018Astrid tries to get away from her family, she loves fashion but she isn\u2019t tied to it and it doesn\u2019t define her.\n\nPayton\u2019s mood subtly influences his clothes\n\nPayton goes through a plethora of emotions throughout the series and they influence what he wears.\n\n\u2018There are certain times when Payton\u2019s a bit down in the season and he\u2019ll be wearing a looser sweater and pants and they won\u2019t be as tailored,\u2019 Claire revealed.\n\n\u2018Even down to alterations, we\u2019d alter things better when he was happier and on a high,\u2019 she added.\n\n\u2018There are times when he\u2019s down and we might not make it as perfect because we wanted to show the character is vulnerable.\u2019\n\nBack Into The Closet is a weekly series that delves into most iconic costumes to ever grace television, from shows past and present.
