They were part of a shared fleet offered as a corporate perk; employees aren\u2019t supposed to ride them off the property, but many ignore this rule, abandoning them around town to the ire of Facebook\u2019s neighbors.\n\nThat night, Facebook\u2019s security guards reported the bicycles as stolen. And after pinging their coordinates on GPS trackers, they alerted the Menlo Park Police Department, saying the company intended to prosecute. A police officer quickly found a Hispanic man and arrested him for larceny.\n\nIt\u2019s common for residents to opportunistically use Facebook\u2019s discarded bicycles, and for years police routinely stopped people\u2014notably young people of color, according to some community accounts\u2014for riding them, fomenting fears about racial profiling. The bicycles became an unexpected symbol of police tension in Menlo Park and East Palo Alto, where people of color feel criminalized under the shadow of immense technology wealth.\n\nThe 2005 incident, which Facebook denies any knowledge of, is notable because of what happened after the arrest: Nothing. The man, it turned out, was a Facebook contract worker. According to Menlo Park police documents that Motherboard obtained through a public records request, \u201cwhen representatives from Facebook learned that [the man] was a Facebook employee they requested that no criminal charges be brought against him,\u201d and he was released. The dutiful compliance of the police\u2014first chasing after Facebook property that Facebook employees left around the community as litter, then standing down when told by Facebook that the culprit was part of a special, protected class\u2014is a minor instantiation of a broader issue: Just how intertwined Facebook and local police have become.\n\nThe Bay Area has long been a sandbox for technology giants who are no longer merely occupying communities, but building and reshaping them. In Menlo Park, an affluent, mostly white city of 35,000, Facebook at one point paid workers not to live in lower-income neighborhoods near the company\u2019s headquarters. And now, there's a police unit that is funded by Facebook to patrol the area surrounding its campus. The bill comes in at over $2 million annually\u2014big money in a small city.\n\nThis deeply unusual relationship has highlighted issues of policing ethics and thrown disparities between Menlo Park and neighboring East Palo Alto into stark relief. When Menlo Park police began confronting people for riding Facebook bicycles off-campus, for instance, residents of East Palo Alto, a primarily Black and Latinx community, worried that law enforcement was racially profiling people who did not appear to them as Facebook employees.\n\n\u201cYou create a danger when you have public servants being privately funded,\u201d J.T. Faraji, an East Palo Alto resident and founder of the activist group Real Community Coalition, told Motherboard. \u201cIt becomes the privatization of the law, and the law is supposed to work for everyone. To me, that\u2019s a major breakdown in the system. It should be illegal for private corporations to have their own police force.\u201d\n\n(\u201cOur funding is not a privatization of the law,\u201d Facebook spokesperson Anthony Harrison told Motherboard. \u201cWe have a long-term commitment to Menlo Park, and we want it to remain a safe and inclusive environment for everyone who calls it home.\u201d)\n\nImage: City of Menlo Park\n\nThe \u201cFacebook Unit,\u201d as it was nicknamed by Menlo Park police, has not gotten much attention outside of these communities, despite being one of the nation\u2019s only privately-funded public police forces.\n\nPublic records obtained by Motherboard\u2014hundreds of pages of notes, proposals in draft and final form, presentations, and emails between Facebook and the Menlo Park Police Department over several years\u2014provide an unprecedented look at how the partnership was forged and how it operates, as well as at public concerns about law enforcement\u2019s intimate ties to one of the most powerful technology companies in the world.\n\n\u201cThis would be concerning to me as a community member,\u201d said Chris Burbank of the Center for Policing Equity, a research consortium founded at the University of California-Los Angeles that focuses on transparency in law enforcement. \u201cI don\u2019t care who it is. You don\u2019t get to buy a police department.\u201d\n\nFacebook in Menlo Park\n\nEight years ago, Facebook outgrew its Palo Alto headquarters and moved to 1 Hacker Way, an eastern sliver of Menlo Park that formerly housed the dot-com darling Sun Microsystems. There was open speculation at the time about \u201cwhether Facebook's relatively young workforce will embrace a fairly isolated campus surrounded by one of Menlo Park's more troubled neighborhoods.\u201d But in true imperial fashion Facebook then sprawled west, spending more than $1 billion on a Frank Gehry-designed campus bursting with amenities such as pop-up shops, bike paths, redwood groves, and \u201cgreen-scapes.\u201d\n\nIts latest conquest is a corporate complex called Willow Village just south of 1 Hacker Way. Once complete, it will become the largest development in Menlo Park\u2019s history, with 1.75 million square feet of offices, up to 200,000 square feet of retail, 1,500 housing units, parks, a hotel, restaurants, and possibly even a town square.\n\nAs Facebook snatched up real estate, it promised a suite of public paybacks in development agreements struck with the city. The company declared in characteristically grandiose terms that its vision for Menlo Park would be one \u201cthat promotes connection and community.\u201d (Critics likened the area to a \u201ccompany town.\u201d)\n\nAnd in 2013, Facebook paid to offset a police substation in Menlo Park\u2019s poorest neighborhood, Belle Haven, which is adjacent to Facebook\u2019s campus and home to many of the city\u2019s Latinx residents. One year later, the company gave Menlo Park a $600,000 grant to hire a community safety officer for the substation for up to five years. This was then believed to be the nation\u2019s only privately funded full-time policing job.\n\nMap: Niko Teitel\n\nThe nontraditional union of public and private interests was covered by outlets such as the New York Times, which wrote that the plan \u201cevoked some disquiet.\u201d But little rationale has been given for why Facebook is authorized to do this, and what its motivations are.\n\nTogether, Facebook and Menlo Park\u2019s government swatted down complaints from citizens, reporters, and watchdog groups that the partnership is alarming, even sinister. They preferred to present the arrangement as a \u201cpublic benefit,\u201d and the best, most logical conclusion to a corporate behemoth transforming an urban landscape. In response to concerns about preferential treatment, the Menlo Park Police Department told NBC Bay Area in 2015 that just .02 percent of service calls that year were to Facebook headquarters.\n\nYet interviews and documents obtained by Motherboard inform a different truth. More than just being neighborly, Facebook is designing and building an ecosystem in its own image.\n\nThe genesis of the \u201cFacebook Unit\u201d\n\nAround 2016, Facebook approached the Menlo Park Police Department about funding a new unit\u2014comprised of five officers and one sergeant\u2014to cover the area encompassing its current and future campuses. The zone was given the moniker \u201cM-2\u201d and sits kitty-corner to East Palo Alto, and would eventually become a fourth police patrol called \u201cBeat 4.\u201d\n\nOn February 4, 2016, Dave Bertini, who is now Menlo Park\u2019s police chief but served as commander at the time, emailed then-police chief Robert Jonsen with a proposal for the Facebook Unit.\n\n\u201cFacebook Inc. has approached the Police Department regarding assigning a specific team of police officers to the Facebook campus,\u201d it said, referring to in-person discussions between Facebook and police.\n\nApproximately 14,674 of Facebook\u2019s employees work in Menlo Park, and Willow Village would increase that capacity to 35,000. This presented a logistical concern for the Menlo Park Police Department, which maintains a ratio of 1 officer to 1,000 people in the city during the daytime. At one point, Facebook \u201cproposed hiring off-duty officers from other communities\u201d to address this issue, according to police records.\n\nBy city estimates, the department would need another 17 sworn officers by 2040 to maintain the status quo. \u201cFacebook said, \u2018Let\u2019s give you a jumpstart,\u2019\u201d Bertini told Motherboard. \u201cIt was their way of saying, 'Let us help you mitigate the impact of us being here.'\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to show how the 1 officer to 1000 serviced population will be stretched without our initial support,\u201d Facebook\u2019s director of global security services, Marjorie Jackson, wrote in a strategizing email to Jonsen on March 1, 2017.\n\nBut records show that policing ratios were only part of the push to create the new unit.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of recent high profile terrorist or terrorist inspired attacks [...] Facebook and the police department are aware of the heightened need for security for the Facebook campus and its employees and visitors,\u201d the police proposal stated. \u201cAt issue is the police personnel necessary to respond to such incidents along with a current lack of any deterrence...at the Facebook campuses.\u201d\n\n(A later version of this proposal swapped \u201cterrorist or terrorist inspired attacks\u201d for \u201cthreats against interests in this country.\u201d)\n\nBertini told Motherboard he has \u201cno doubt\u201d that Facebook is a target. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if we\u2019re going to have an armed intruder, it\u2019s just a matter of when,\u201d he said.\n\nImage: Jason Koebler\n\nBertini was among those who responded to the 2018 shooting at YouTube\u2019s San Bruno campus where a woman injured three people before dying by suicide. Following the incident, he told the San Mateo Daily Journal that he increased foot patrols at Facebook and hoped to \u201cnormalize the officers being there.\u201d Last year, Facebook\u2019s headquarters were evacuated due to a bomb threat and it experienced a sarin threat this July. Officers throughout Menlo Park responded to both incidents.\n\nMenlo Park Police Department records show that on multiple occasions it considered \u201cspecialized training\u201d for Facebook Unit officers, including active shooter response training and \u201cSWAT and sniper training.\u201d Facebook has also contracted Menlo Park police time ahead of VIP events on its campus.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to focus on terrorism,\u201d Bertini said. \u201cWe\u2019re also worried about domestic terrorism or someone with a mental illness who shows up at the Facebook campus saying they have a meeting with Zuckerberg.\u201d\n\nHow Facebook and Menlo Park negotiated a deal\n\nPolice meeting notes from September 6, 2016 mention that \u201cFacebook has been very persistent about getting the program established,\u201d and emails show that Facebook representatives periodically checked in about the hiring status of these officers.\n\nOn April 28, 2016, Facebook\u2019s head of global facilities, John Tenanes, emailed the police department \u201crequesting information regarding availability\u201d and expressed that Facebook wanted the unit to be active as soon as July 2016.\n\nBut the Menlo Park City Council did not hold a study session about the unit until February 28, 2017. And Menlo Park Mayor Ray Mueller, who served as councilman at the time, was opposed to the idea of Facebook contributing a monetary gift, saying it was \u201cbad public policy\u201d to accept favors from companies in exchange for city services, reported the Almanac.\n\nThe optics of such an arrangement were not lost on the police department, which acknowledged that \u201cto have a company fund a public entity, specifically law enforcement, can draw skepticism with concerns of preferential treatment.\u201d This would perhaps be true given what negotiations had initially entailed: A draft agreement from 2016 between the city and Facebook \u201cregarding donations to fund a community police officer positions,\u201d for instance, states that \u201cFacebook will make an annual donation to the City for the express purposes of funding the Position(s).\u201d\n\nTo mitigate a \u201cpay for play\u201d situation, the Menlo Park City Council asked if it could \u201cnegotiate [a] general in-lieu sales tax agreement\u201d with Facebook, according to meeting notes from April 24, 2017. Bertini said the city eventually landed on the $11.2 million figure to represent the unit\u2019s cost over five years, with the potential for a two-year extension.\n\nOn September 26, 2017, the council agreed that Facebook would deposit the money into the city\u2019s unrestricted general fund, reported the Almanac. This represents a bet that property tax revenue generated by Facebook\u2019s new development will cover policing costs when the five years are up\u2014and a way to semi-plausibly argue that the police Facebook is paying for are not in fact being paid for by Facebook.\n\n\u201cThere was no obligation to use the in-lieu money to pay for the police force,\u201d Mueller told Motherboard. \u201cWe could disband that unit if we wanted to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe city can use it in any way it deems necessary to benefit all the citizens of Menlo Park,\u201d Harrison said.\n\n\u201cWhy is Facebook using a police force that has a record of abusing Black and brown residents in Menlo Park and East Palo Alto?\u201d\n\nMueller stressed that Facebook\u2019s millions do not go toward the Facebook Unit, even though the patrol was borne out of its contribution. The agreement stipulates that the $11.2 million will be spent on services \u201cthat benefit the safety of local community,\u201d but at the city\u2019s discretion. There is currently no way to discern whether Facebook\u2019s money directly supports Beat 4 activities, as it is not distinguished by the general fund.\n\nWhen asked if this obfuscates police spending, Mueller said it would be inappropriate \u201cif we actually kept track of Beat 4 money,\u201d or if officers were to believe that Facebook was footing their salaries.\n\nIn any event, the Facebook Unit became fully staffed on August 1 of this year, more than three years after its inception.\n\nCommunity concerns and a history of over-policing\n\nThroughout the process, Facebook\u2019s neighbors expressed serious reservations about the partnership and its implications. The psychological effects of Menlo Park\u2019s heightened police presence have demoralized residents of color, who told the Almanac about instances of being profiled by officers or searched during traffic stops.\n\n\u201cWhy is Facebook using a police force that has a record of abusing Black and brown residents in Menlo Park and East Palo Alto?\u201d Faraji asked.\n\nIn 2017, Faraji was among a group of community organizers who met privately with Facebook to discuss the Menlo Park police unit and other issues stemming from its rapid growth, reported Palo Alto Online.\n\nLocal housing activists also say that Facebook has accelerated gentrification and is directly responsible for displacing families, reported the Guardian. Until 2018, Facebook employees were offered a \u201cbalanced work-life\u201d bonus of $15,000 for moving within 10 miles of its campus. But the incentive excluded East Palo Alto and Menlo Park\u2019s Belle Haven neighborhood, both communities of color that are less than several miles from Facebook\u2019s campus.\n\nDuring development talks with the city in 2016, \u201ccity officials and community leaders had the impression that this program was contributing to gentrification of those communities and asked Facebook to exclude them from the program,\u201d a source close to the discussion told Motherboard. \u201cFacebook data didn\u2019t support this conclusion, but the company decided to agree to the city\u2019s wishes.\u201d\n\nA screenshot from one of the Facebook proposals.\n\nThe aftermath, in which Facebook essentially paid employees to avoid certain communities, while necessitating more law enforcement in others, could certainly be critiqued as social engineering\u2014not the online sort that it has been accused of enabling in the past, but a physical and environmental manipulation of human resources and migration.\n\n\u201cThis little area has a long history of being excluded from the wealth of the surrounding area,\u201d Mackenzie Rodriguez, who has lived in East Palo Alto for more than a decade, told Motherboard.\n\nOne of the most obvious manifestations of this has been Facebook\u2019s bicycles.\n\n\u201cYou have an extremely poor community that is being flooded with toys of wealth, and these things are going to happen,\u201d Faraji said, noting that he does not condone stealing. \u201cPeople who are going without are not going to understand why one person can use something for free and another person can\u2019t.\n\nOn February 7, 2019, dozens of residents from East Palo Alto and Belle Haven met over growing concerns that police were targeting young people of color for riding Facebook\u2019s bicycles. A blue and yellow flyer asked community members to discuss the \u201cchallenges that have risen from the presence of FB Bikes [and the] impact this has had on residents and our youth.\u201d\n\nResidents said that teens in low-income areas had been singled out by the Menlo Park Police Department and the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office, and should not be detained or ticketed for, say, using a Facebook bicycle to get to school, and that police responses should be less punitive.\n\n\u201cWe can't condone young people taking bikes,\u201d said East Palo Alto Mayor Lisa Gauthier at the time, according to a report from the Almanac. \u201cWe don't want them to think it's OK.\u201d But Facebook, on the other hand, had not sufficiently engaged with the community on the issue, Gauthier added.\n\nThe Menlo Park Police Department did not attend the meeting, but several Facebook representatives did, claiming that the company had never asked officers to stop, detain, or arrest people for riding Facebook bicycles. Facebook clarified to Motherboard that it never asked police to confront people off-campus.\n\nFacebook bikes on the campus. Image: Jason Koebler\n\n\u201cI suggest we get together to share actions and communication,\u201d Facebook\u2019s global security services manager, John Day, wrote in an email to Menlo Park and East Palo Alto police the following day.\n\n\u201cFYI. This is the first time Facebook has given us an answer in writing,\u201d Bertini wrote colleagues, referring to Facebook\u2019s email.\n\nMotherboard obtained an internal bulletin that Bertini issued on February 11, 2019. \u201cEffective immediately, officers are not to stop or detain anyone on a Facebook bicycle for the sole reason that they are in possession of a Facebook bicycle,\u201d it stated.\n\nIt is unclear how many teens or people of color have been stopped by Menlo Park officers for using Facebook\u2019s bicycles. Emails show that East Palo Alto community organizers requested this data from the department on February 20, 2019.\n\nIn East Palo Alto, where many families struggle to afford housing as the average home price hits $1 million, \u201cworrying about their kids having a bad interaction with the police over a stupid bike? Not a thing they should be worried about,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nPolice logs obtained by Motherboard detail several occasions wherein Menlo Park officers responded to bicycle related complaints by Facebook.\n\nOn July 14, 2015, \u201cFacebook security reported that subjects came onto the property, rode Facebook bicycles around and then stole bicycle helmets. [Reporting party] did not want a crime report taken but asked to have the incident documented.\u201d\n\nOn July 10, 2019, \u201cseveral juveniles observed stealing Facebook bicycles by Facebook security were asked to leave the campus. Instead of leaving, the juveniles became hostile towards security and one subject threatened to come back and shoot the employees. Investigation ongoing.\u201d\n\nBertini denied all claims of racial profiling, saying the Menlo Park Police Department requires its officers to complete training that addresses implicit bias. When police encountered someone \u201cwho was obviously not a Facebook employee, like a 12-year-old,\u201d that person would be stopped and the bicycle confiscated in most cases.\n\nHowever, Facebook\u2019s claim that it had never requested police officers to detain or arrest people for riding its bicycles, which it recently told residents at the meeting in East Palo Alto, is complicated.\n\n\u201cWe've never asked Menlo Park police to stop individuals riding on bikes in the community,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cWe've tried to limit thefts of bikes on our campus and while we initially explored prosecution of in progress bike thefts, we quickly reversed that decision in favor of exploring alternatives such a public awareness campaign and community partnerships to reduce bike removal from our campus.\u201d\n\nBut on June 6, 2019, Patrol Sergeant Aaron Dixon, who is assigned to the Facebook Unit, emailed police management stating that \u201cFacebook has been experiencing an increase in bicycle thefts. As a result, they have called dispatch stating they will prosecute during the in progress thefts.\u201d\n\nBertini explained that Menlo Park police are currently in discussion with Facebook about this, but will not be amending their policies unless Facebook states otherwise.\n\n\u201cThey believe there are large scale organized thefts of bikes,\u201d Bertini said. \u201cWe will look at that differently than the one-offs that were talked about in training bulletin. If there is an organized conspiracy, we will investigate.\u201d\n\nToday the Facebook Unit is operating on all cylinders in the tiny technotopia that Facebook has constructed for itself in Menlo Park. The company hosts a farmer\u2019s market, \u201cCoffee & Chat,\u201d and sponsors neighborhood happenings like a festival and August\u2019s \u201cNational Night Out\u201d celebration in Menlo Park and East Palo Alto. It also holds an annual appreciation lunch for local law enforcement.\n\nBut \u201cas much as Facebook says they want to have the community involved, the real community involved is the new one that they\u2019re building,\u201d Faraji said.\n\nAll documents that informed this reporting can be found here.\n\n", "description": "Hundreds of pages of documents obtained by Motherboard show how Facebook is using the Menlo Park Police Department to reshape the city.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dadfd266518eb000a8e0a67/lede/1571684069389-08_08_2019_FACEBOOK_COPS_CV.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
