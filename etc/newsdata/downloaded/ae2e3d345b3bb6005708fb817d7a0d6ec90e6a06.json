During his congressional career, he garnered consistently high favourable ratings - 100% in 2013 - from the American Conservative Union.\n\nEven before his new position was announced, some detractors were accusing him of joining a legal team whose aim is to stifle Democrats\u2019 investigation of the president, even though he fought for full White House disclosures while in Congress.\n\nA House Democratic aide said Gowdy would be under pressure from Democrats to square his prior aggressive assertion of congressional prerogatives with Trump\u2019s stonewalling.\n\nJay Sekulow, a lawyer for Trump, praised Gowdy in announcing his hiring.\n\n\u201cI have known Trey for years and worked with him when he served in Congress,\u201d Sekulow said in a statement. \u201cHis legal skills and his advocacy will serve the President well. Trey\u2019s command of the law is well known and his service on Capitol Hill will be a great asset as a member of our team.\u201d\n\nBENGHAZI PANEL\n\nWhen the Benghazi panel was created by Republicans who then controlled the House, Democrats protested that it was formed after several other congressional panels found no deliberate wrongdoing by Obama administration officials in responding to the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens.\n\nDemocrats also accused Republicans of using the panel as a forum to sour public opinion against Clinton who was preparing to run for president in 2016.\n\nAt the time, Gowdy conducted a series of high-profile hearings as part of an extended investigation that focused at times on Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state - an issue that Trump also spotlighted during his 2016 presidential campaign against Clinton.\n\nIn the end, Gowdy\u2019s Benghazi panel issued an 800-page report that had the backing of seven Republicans on the committee, while four Democrats opposed it.\n\nThe report criticized Clinton, saying she and her staff showed a \u201cshameful\u201d lack of response to congressional investigators, despite her 11 hours of contentious testimony to the committee.\n\nWhile Gowdy\u2019s Republican colleagues praised his aggressiveness in seeking information, he also came in for occasional ribbing for cycling through hairstyles.", "description": "Former U.S. Representative Trey Gowdy stepped into a familiar role on Wednesday when President Donald Trump tapped him to join his outside legal team to help battle a Democratic-led impeachment inquiry: conservative battering ram.", "authors": ["Richard Cowan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439047576&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9826Z", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
