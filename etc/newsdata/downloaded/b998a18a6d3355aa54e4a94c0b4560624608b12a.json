The Hill has reached out to the school district for comment on the matter.\n\nNone of Mansmann\u2019s or the other students\u2019 notes alleged they were victims of sexual assault. None of the notes mentioned students by name.\n\nThe two other students who were suspended have not been publicly identified.\n\nThe suspension at the high school just outside Portland led to a walkout consisting of roughly 50 students one day this month, the AP noted.", "description": "Three girls were reportedly suspended from their high school in Maine for posting a note in the bathroom notifying fellow students that they believed one of their classmates was sexually assaulting others.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mainehighschool_101519_wgme.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
