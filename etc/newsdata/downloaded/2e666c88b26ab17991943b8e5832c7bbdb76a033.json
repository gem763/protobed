John McDonnell.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to stand with hundreds of thousands of people in demanding that they, not wealthy, privileged and out-of-touch hard-right Tory MPs, have the final say on what is an even worse deal than Theresa May\u2019s,\u201d Mr McDonnell said ahead of the march.\n\n\u201cOur policy is clear: Let the people decide.\u201d\n\nThe crowd cheered on Saturday afternoon as MPs voted to withhold support from the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\n\u201cHear us,\u201d some chanted outside parliament, while others shouted: \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote!\u201d\n\nA number of
