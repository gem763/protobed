REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nThe ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday also showed private payrolls growth in August was not as strong as previously estimated, and said \u201cbusinesses have turned more cautious in their hiring,\u201d with small enterprises becoming \u201cespecially hesitant.\u201d\n\nIt came on the heels of a survey on Tuesday showing manufacturing activity tumbled to a more than 10-year low in September. The reports added to cooling consumer spending in suggesting that the economy was losing momentum, though a recession is probably not on the horizon.\n\nThe longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, is losing ground with the blame largely put on a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has eroded business confidence. Slowing job growth is a concern as it could curb consumer spending, which has been the economy\u2019s growth engine.\n\nPrivate employers added 135,000 jobs in September, the ADP National Employment report showed. Data for August was revised downward to show private payrolls increasing by 157,000 jobs instead of the previously reported 195,000 positions.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast private employment to rise by 140,000 jobs in September.\n\nThe dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street dropped to one-month lows in early trade.\n\nThe ADP figures come ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report due out on Friday, which includes both public- and private-sector employment.\n\nThe ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody\u2019s Analytics, has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government\u2019s employment report. However, last month\u2019s job gains fit in with economists\u2019 expectations for moderate nonfarm payrolls growth in September.\n\nAccording to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 145,000 jobs in September, after rising 130,000 in August. Job gains have averaged 158,000 per month this year, but remain above the roughly 100,000 needed each month to keep up with growth in the working age population.\n\nThe unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3.7% for a fourth straight month.\n\nThe ADP report showed employment in the goods-producing sector increased by 8,000 jobs in September. Manufacturing payrolls rose by 2,000 jobs last month and construction added 9,000 positions. Natural resources and mining shed 3,000 jobs.\n\nThe services sector added 127,000 jobs last month, with gains concentrated in health services, professional and business services, and trade, transportation and utilities industry.", "description": "Hiring by U.S. private employers slowed further in September, suggesting that trade tensions, which have pressured manufacturing, could be spilling over to the labor market.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436245094&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910ZU"}
