The NFL and college football are in full swing. The MLB playoffs, too, are reaching a fever pitch. The NBA preseason is underway, though all anyone is talking about is China, the Hong Kong protests, Daryl Morey, Donald Trump, and Steve Kerr. In any event, NHL teams are acquiring PUPPIES now! There's really nothing to add here. Just look at these little guys.\n\nCheck out these adorable team members.\n\nTHE POWER OF POSITIVITY\n\nCheerleader Lindsey Schuler suffered a horrific spinal cord injury following a gymnastics accident. She couldn't feel her arms. She couldn't feel her legs. Just two hours later, she was in surgery. The expected outcome, her doctor said, is *maybe* she can use her hands again one day. Lindsey wanted to walk again at her senior prom. But that was just weeks away.\n\nBut guess what? That's just what she did.\n\nCLOSE Lindsey Schuler, a cheerleader at Hamilton Southeastern High, suffered a spinal cord injury during a practice in 2016, and has been in recovery.

(Photo: Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWeek 7 of the college football season looked like it could be promising on paper \u2014 and it delivered by producing the best Saturday of the year.\n\nLSU's new high-powered offense beat Florida in a shootout \u2013 which is confusing, we know \u2013 in the game of the night. Earlier, the Red River Shootout ... wasn't really a shootout and featured strong defense by Oklahoma. Feels wrong, too.\n\nHere are the rest of the highlights from Saturday:\n\nG.O.A.T\n\nSimone Biles on Day 9 of the Gymnastics World Championships. (Photo: Laurence Griffiths, Getty Images)\n\nSimone Biles is very good at gymnastics. You already knew that. Over the weekend, she tied the record for most world gymnastics medals. She also discussed with Nancy Armour where she keeps all that hardware, her love-hate relationship with the balance beam, and how she even impresses herself at times.\n\nSUPER BOWL SURPRISE\n\nCoach Gray with his players. (Photo: Anne-Marie Caruso/NorthJersey.com)\n\nMatt Gray is a volunteer high school football coach in New Jersey. He was born with Down syndrome. On Friday, he got the surprise of a lifetime when New York Giants linebacker Kareem Martin presented Coach Gray with two Super Bowl tickets. Gray, who's also known as Matty Ice, is a big Giants fan, and he also is a Matt Ryan fan, for obvious reasons. He's, uh, probably not gonna see either of those teams in Miami this February.\n\nOnly at the USA TODAY Sports Network\n\nFrom original reporting to some of the nation's best columns, these are stories you can only get from the USA TODAY Sports Network:\n\nTHE BEST POLICY\n\nKiah Parrott of Kokomo High School in Indiana always dreamed of reaching the podium at the state golf tournament. Last weekend, she did just that, finishing sixth. But then, as she was eating lunch, it all fell apart. Parrott noticed that the live scoring app had her score wrong. Then, she realized she had signed an incorrect scorecard. She had two options: play along, knowing that her score was wrong or report the mistake and disqualify herself. She acted fast.\n\nNBA IN CHINA: NOT GOING WELL\n\nFans hold Chinese flags as they watch the NBA preseason game between the Lakers and Nets in China. (Photo: STR, AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThere's a lot to unpack here, but here's the gist: Rockets GM Daryl Morey tweeted support for Honk Kong protestors. Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta took issue with the since-deleted tweet. As did many in mainland China. But this was just the beginning. Below is our full coverage of the fallout.\n\nBOSA VS. BAKER VS. SHERMAN\n\nSan Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa sacks Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield during their Monday Night Football game. (Photo: Tony Avelar, AP)\n\nWho could forget Baker Mayfield, while at Oklahoma, planting the OU flag at midfield after the Sooners topped Ohio State? Not Nick Bosa! The former Buckeye returned the favor after the 49ers' resounding victory over Mayfield's Browns. But wait, there's more! Richard Sherman called Mayfield \"bush league'\" for not shaking his hand before the game. Sherman must have forgotten there are roughly a zillion cameras at NFL games, and at least one of those cameras caught Mayfield shaking Sherman's hand. Handshake-gate averted.\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU MAY HAVE MISSED\n\nMORE NEWSLETTERS!\n\nWant more content like this in your inbox?
