In an effort to treat the victims with respect and preserve evidence, authorities are slowly transferring the bodies from the truck to a hospital mortuary where the process of identification will take place.\n\nBut the task is likely to be difficult. People smugglers normally take the passports of their passengers to obscure their identities, stripping them of their names and giving them new documents when they arrive at their destinations.\n\nPolice initially believed the victims were Chinese but later acknowledged that the details were still evolving. Attention shifted to Vietnam after the family of a 26-year-old Vietnamese woman released text messages suggesting she had suffocated in the truck.\n\n\u2018The majority of the Chinese trafficking victims I work with have accrued debts to Snakehead gangs\u2019 @shalinipatel0 Post-mortem examinations are due to be carried out on some of the 39 people found dead in a lorry in Essex.https://t.co/OvUEwY8IXp pic.twitter.com/86P1S3W5fV \u2014 Victoria Derbyshire (@VictoriaLIVE) October 25, 2019", "description": "(AP) --\u00a0UK police in Essex say all of the 39 victims found dead in a truck container in southeastern England are now out of the truck and in a mortuary awaiting autopsies.", "authors": ["Breitbart London"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/migrants--640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
