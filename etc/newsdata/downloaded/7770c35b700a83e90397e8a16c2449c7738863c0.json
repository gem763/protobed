Come early to catch the picturesque chamber flooded with morning sunshine that spotlights the royal pavilion that sits inside.\n\nOutdoorsy travelers can camp in a park bungalow or opt for more luxe accommodation in the nearby tourist town of Hua Hin, three hours by car, or four by train, from Bangkok.\n\nLopburi for history buffs\n\nBypass the tour groups at the ancient city of Ayutthaya and head two hours north of Bangkok for a more serene stroll through Thai history.\n\nLopburi, one of Thailand's oldest cities, boasts Khmer-era temples and the uncrowded ruins of King Narai's Palace, which was built in the 1600s.\n\nIt's also known for the mischievous monkeys that gather at Phra Prang Sam Yot temple in the center of town. Pro tip: Keep a safe distance from the monkeys and hide anything you don't want them to steal.\n\nGetting around\n\nCar rental costs about $20 per day, and an international driver's permit is required. You can also hire a driver at most major car rental companies, book a taxi or explore by train.", "description": "Thailand's southern beaches lure travelers with their turquoise water and dramatic limestone cliffs, but there's more to explore in the Southeast Asian country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/15/5da50e0ba310cf3e97a136ee.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
