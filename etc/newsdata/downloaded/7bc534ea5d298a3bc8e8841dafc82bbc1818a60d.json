A federal judge hearing the case, in an all-time great quote, thinks this may not be a big deal: \u201cThere doesn\u2019t really seem to be anyone in America who seems to be concerned about it,\u201d he said, according to Law360.\n\nApple argues that it already explains how it measures screen size on its packaging, according to Law360, and has been trying to get the case dismissed since March. The plaintiffs are hoping to make it into a nationwide class-action lawsuit, but it hasn\u2019t been certified yet \u2014 and the judge reportedly said there\u2019s legal precedent that could keep it from becoming one.\n\nHonestly, I can relate with the judge. I\u2019m coming up on week 2 of owning the iPhone 11 Pro, my first notched iPhone, and I don\u2019t really notice or care about the notch. And I don\u2019t know any non-Verge staffers that care about it, either. Sure, I\u2019d be happy with the extra screen real estate if the notch wasn\u2019t there, but the screen is fine and plenty big already.", "description": "The iPhone\u2019s notch may not be the prettiest thing in the world, but two plaintiffs have sued over it.
