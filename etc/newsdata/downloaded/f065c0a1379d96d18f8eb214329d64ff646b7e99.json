The ship lets off three long foghorn blasts, which are answered in kind by its companion vessel, the Akademik Federov, moored 50m (164ft) away. A brass band starts up as the Polarstern begins moving out of the harbour of Troms\u00f8, on the northern fringes of the Norwegian coast. Before we\u2019ve moved 10m (32ft) off shore, the Arctic breeze whips the sound away.\n\nIn the ship's gangway, one of the expedition leaders, Markus Rex of the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Germany, leans on the railing with some of the other scientists on board, looking out towards the dark fjords of the Norwegian coastline. He has just launched the largest Arctic expedition there has ever been.\n\n\"I don't know how I feel,\" he says. \"I honestly don't know.\" He may not, but he looks ecstatic.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 Why is the Arctic smouldering\n\n\u2022 Ten simple ways to act on climate change\n\n\u2022 The poisons released by melting Arctic ice\n\nPolarstern, whose name means North Star in German, is an icebreaker dedicated to scientific research. It has just begun a year-long mission to the ice cap of the central Arctic Ocean. The ship will sail to the eastern edge of the ice at around 85 degrees north and 135 degrees east \u2013 about 200km (124 miles) from the pole, although the exact location will depend on the state of the ice we find.\n\nOnce there, the scientists will search for the perfect ice floe to anchor the vessel to. They will then build a frozen metropolis \u2013 an extensive research camp with outposts up to 50km (31 miles) away from the ship.\n\nPolarstern itself will remain frozen in place to drift with the camp wherever the winds and currents will carry the ice. During its ponderous, 7km-a-day drift across the Arctic, the ship and its crew will experience sub-zero temperatures with just curious polar bears for company.
