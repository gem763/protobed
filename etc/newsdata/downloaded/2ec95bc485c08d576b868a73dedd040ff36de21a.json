But is it Goldman?", "language": "en", "text": "In a packet of slides sent to clients yesterday, Goldman Sachs Group technical analyst Sheba Jafari said that Bitcoin could go up by 23% in the short term, and that later the coin could go even higher. That doesn\u2019t mean the bank is bullish on Bitcoin, though.\n\nThe views \u201care not an \u2018official view\u2019 of Goldman Sachs,\u201d cautions a note introducing the 28-page packet of slides titled \u201cThe Charts That Matter Next Week.\u201d The bank sends such packets to clients weekly to highlight market trends to watch out for.\n\nBased on technical analysis, investors should use retrenchment \u201cas an opportunity to buy on weakness as long as it doesn\u2019t retrace further than the 9,084 low,\u201d Jafari said. Bitcoin dropped 11% since June 26, and is now at $11 365. She predicted it could climb to as much as $13 971.\n\n\n\nThe Bitcoin chart was the last of 21 slides, offering technical analysis of everything from bond yields to gold. When Jafari looked at Bitcoin in late 2017, she cautioned traders against betting on a surge past $8 000. The coin ended up hitting nearly $20 000 about a month later before cratering.\n\nJaffari used Elliott Wave theory, created by the American accountant and author Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s, which seeks to predict moves in financial markets by dividing past trends into five phases, or waves. The theory proposes that a five-wave gain or decline is followed by a three-wave corrective move in the opposite direction.\n\nGoldman had previously considered opening a cryptocurrency trading desk, Bloomberg reported in 2017. It\u2019s also looking for a cryptocurrency project manager.", "description": "In a packet of slides sent to clients yesterday, Goldman Sachs Group technical analyst Sheba Jafari said that Bitcoin could go up by 23% in the short term, and that later the coin could go even higher.
