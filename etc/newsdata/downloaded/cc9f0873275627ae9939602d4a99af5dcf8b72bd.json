Or is that Priscilla, Queen of the Desert?\n\nEither way, I was becoming seriously impressed with the performance and comfort of Audi\u2019s first ever fully electric car \u2013 the long-awaited e-tron family sports utility vehicle, which goes on sale in Britain early next year priced from just under \u00a372,000.\n\nAnd about four hours into my driving day, a strange thing happened.\n\nHaving relaxed into driving it around town, on motorways and across stretches of desert in Abu Dhabi - where the e-tron\u2019s global launch has been taking place this week - I completely forgot I was driving an \u2018electric\u2019 car.\n\nDesert raid: We've been testing the new Audi e-tron electric SUV in remote conditions in the United Arab Emirates\n\nI was simply driving an Audi \u2013 and a pretty decent one at that. But it\u2019s got some electric competition in the shape of Tesla Model X and Jaguar\u2019s I-Pace.\n\nAt first glance, the new five-seater Audi-e-tron looks like a conventionally sporty SUV and as far from a quirky milk float or sci-fi vision as you are likely to get \u2013 though as well as ditching a conventional petrol and diesel engine, it has swapped conventional door mirrors for a virtual electronic replacement using cameras and touch screens.\n\nBut boy does it shift \u2013 on the road and off.\n\nIt really is a prime example of the sort of 'Vorsprung durch Technik\u2019 \u2013 or leap ahead through technology \u2013 for which the German car firm has become rightly renowned over many decades.\n\nAudi\u2019s been slower to the electric car market than some of its rivals \u2013 with Britain\u2019s Jaguar I-Pace leaping ahead of the e-tron in the launch stakes by about 18 months.\n\nMy favourite touch in the interior was the very intuitive handle-like housing for choosing Park, Drive and Reverse.\n\nEschewing the popular dial style, I found this new set up very natural to use and it blended in well with the smart, elegant, and quietly hi-tech dashboard and centre console arrangement.\n\nDaily Mail's Ray Massey pictured with Audi's new e-tron. The version pictured is the First Edition, which costs \u00a382,240\n\nThe launch cars are due to arrive in the UK from spring next year, with cheaper versions to follow\n\nThe entry-spec e-tron will cost \u00a371,490 but won't be available until later in 2019\n\nThe 'e' in e-tron could also stand for eerily quiet\n\nFiring up the e-tron has its challenges, mind. It\u2019s so quiet at rest it\u2019s hard to tell at rest whether you already have the power on, or not.\n\nEven when you press the ignition button, there\u2019s nothing really obvious to tell you.\n\nIt would be handy to build in a little momentary burble or chime as an audible cue to the driver that you\u2019ve powered up.\n\nIt\u2019s also eerily quiet out on the road. And Audi have built in lots of sound-deadening features \u2013 including plenty of cladding behind the wheel arches to damped noise from the tyres.\n\nBut once out and about it\u2019s a dream to drive and very comfortable for the long-haul epic journey which I undertook in it.\n\nThe e-tron is eerily quiet out on the road. Audi has packed it with sound-deadening features to protect any occupants from annoying road rumble\n\nIt\u2019s a dream to drive and very comfortable for the long-haul epic journey Ray undertook\n\nThe e-tron uses two 408hp a 95kWh lithium ion and two electric motors to develop 408 horse-power\n\nOn the road around town it delivers instantaneous pace with grace.\n\nIt\u2019s a smooth mile-muncher on the motorway. Push down hard, and you really can feel the controlled whoosh of acceleration from rest to 62mph in just 5.7 seconds.\n\nTop speed is 124mph and it is rather easy to let your speed creep up, though the head up display helps keep your velocity in your eye-line.\n\nAll-wheel drive delivered to all-four wheels as needed really came into its own on a steep and wonderfully twisting mountain road where body roll was almost imperceptible it gripped the tarmac like a train on track.\n\nThere\u2019s a bonus on the way down, too. The regenerative braking gives you a power-boost to the batteries by storing charge generated by the descent. I calculated an extra 18km or 11 miles on that one descent alone.\n\nThe e-tron proved to have surprisingly good off-roading capabilities\n\nIt had true grip on steeply inclined desert hills, and cuts though sand-blown tracks and even some dunes with aplomb\n\nWith \u2018Off-road\u2019 mode engaged the e-tron can be raised by up to 35mm for more ground clearance, while the \u2018Raise\u2019 function adds another 15mm\n\nIs it really an off-roader?\n\nAimed at young families and executives who need a practical SUV with a dash of contemporary luxury, the e-tron does not claim to be a full-blooded 4X4.\n\nBut taking it off-road for some gymnastic challenges, it performed much better than I was expecting.\n\nHere the instant electric torque supplied to the wheels from its two electric motors really came into its own.\n\nIt had true grip on steeply inclined desert hills, and cut though sand-blown tracks and even some dunes with aplomb. I was doing a fair lick across the desert and it coped very well indeed \u2013 though a good clean was order by the end.\n\nThe progressive steering and electronically-controlled adaptive air suspension, which are fitted as standard, allow for body ride height to be adjusted automatically.\n\nIn \u2018Off-road\u2019 mode the e-tron can be raised by up to 35mm for more ground clearance, while the \u2018Raise\u2019 function adds another 15mm.\n\nFor speeds above 74.6mph the e-tron is lowered by up to 26mm from its normal height of 172mm. In all, the ride height can be adjusted by up to 76mm depending on speed and driving style.\n\nFor speeds above 74.6mph the e-tron is lowered by up to 26mm from its normal height of 172mm. In all, the ride height can be adjusted by up to 76mm depending on speed and driving style\n\nIt has a claimed range of 248 miles and can achieve 80% of its charge in just 30 minutes using a high-power fast-charging 150kW DC charger\n\nThe e-tron is no slouch - it can accelerate from rest to 62mph in just 5.7 seconds\n\nWill it get you to your destination or leave you with a bout of range anxiety?\n\nThere aren\u2019t many charging points in the deserts of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nFortunately, on paper, it appears to pack enough power to eliminate range anxiety.\n\nIt has a claimed range of 248 miles and can achieve 80 per cent of its charge in just 30 minutes using a high-power fast-charging 150kW DC charger.\n\nThe e-tron is powered by a 95kWh 36-cell battery system siting flat underneath the passenger compartment.\n\nThese drive two electric motors - one driving each axle - and produces 408 horsepower.\n\nIronically, if electric powered cars really do take off, states like Abu Dhabi, which supply around 8 per cent of the world\u2019s oil, will need to diversify as demand for petrol and diesel slumps.\n\nAudi\u2019s decision to ditch conventional mirrors in favour of cameras and touchscreens on the more expensive trim levels has proved a big talking point, but is it more gimmick than serious road safety move?\n\nIt certainly feels odd initially and takes some getting used to. And that's not the only thing that felt alien...\n\nThe e-tron is the first production car to feature 'virtual wing mirrors' using cameras on the end of stalks\n\nThese cameras provide a live feed to screens just above the door handles inside the car (seen here on the left)\n\nVirtual wing mirrors - how do they work?\n\nInstead of bulky silvered wing mirrors, the car I was driving had slim, streamlined rear-facing cameras in smart tube-like housings that looked like they had been styled for Star Trek.\n\nThe cameras fed real-time video images into two screens, each embedded into the armpit of the driver and passenger doors, just below where they join with the front of the car.\n\nFrom my touch screen I could alter with my finger the angle of view on my drivers\u2019-side virtual mirror and also zoom in. By tapping the screen I could also switch to alter the angle of the passenger side \u2018mirror.\u2019\n\nAt first I muffed it completely and had mild panic as I found I\u2019d created very restricted view of the road behind, and was relying only on my conventional interior rear-view mirror.\n\nThen I cracked it and had both digital screens set up to give me the view behind that I needed. Yet my instincts were still to look out of the window and at the camera housings - where mirrors would normally be - rather than below that eye-line and into the corner of the door where the new screens are sited.\n\nYou can read more about the virtual mirrors in a separate piece here.\n\nThe boot has a floor that is level with the bumper, so it's not quite as capacious as the equivalent Audi Q5 with a petrol or diesel engine\n\nThere's plenty of rear leg room, so it's an ideal family car\n\nWe look forward to trying Audi's first all-electric model on the potholed roads in the UK next year - a stern test for any car, even if it can cope with the UAB desert\n\nIf the Audi e-tron is to be a success, it will have to better the Tesla Model X (left) and Jaguar I-Pace (right)\n\nThe first examples in the UK will cost \u00a382k, but entry models due later in 2019 will be \u00a310k cheaper\n\nThe virtual mirrors come as standard on the Launch Edition of the e-tron costing from \u00a382,240 (with 21 inch wheels rather than the 20 inch standard) and the even more highly-specced Edition 1 \u2013 of which only 30 will be sold to the very first UK customers \u2013 at \u00a389.490.\n\nAudi e-tron: Will it fit in my garage?
