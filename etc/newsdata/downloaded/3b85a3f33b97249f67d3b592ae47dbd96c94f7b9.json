The initial story was he'd gone to rehab in Queensland,' Rachel said.\n\nShe then figured out that her ex-boyfriend had more than $2,300 worth of debt that he owed to both herself and friends.\n\nRachel then received news from a mutual friend that her former boyfriend had died.\n\n'It sounds stupid in retrospect, but you don't have any reason to question it. If I called you and told you my mum I'd died, you wouldn't be like, ''give me a death certificate'',' she said.\n\nHer ex-boyfriend's mother had been telling people that he was murdered because he was in debt to a bikie gang.\n\nRachel refused to know the details at the time, and chose to grieve and move on.\n\nHowever, two years after the 'death' she was with a friend at a restaurant in her home town that she knew her ex-boyfriend's brother worked at.\n\nWhile the brother wasn't working at the time, a waitress informed Rachel that he brother was working, and confirmed it was her ex-boyfriend.\n\nRachel said he went into shock and asked if she could talk to him, but was told by the manager to leave the venue.\n\nHer ex-boyfriend's mother had been telling people that he was murdered because he was in debt to a bikie gang (stock image)\n\nShe went to the police and was told it was 'her word against his' that she had loaned him the money.\n\nLater that night she received a text from her ex-boyfriend's mother who was angry that she'd created a 'scene' which caused him to lose his job.\n\nBy this time Rachel had given up on confronting her ex-boyfriend and getting the money.\n\nA few years later she saw him again working at a different restaurant in the same area and tried to start a conversation.\n\n'We made eye contact, and you could see he recognised me. I was like 'Long time no see!' And he went, 'Oh yeah, it has been a long time',' Rachel said.\n\nRachel decided to ask him about the money and her ex-boyfriend then said he didn't recognise her and denied everything.", "description": "Australian woman Rachel was just 18 when she started dating a 21-year-old chef at her local pub, and loaned him $1,000 because he broke his arm and couldn't work.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/22/20258908-0-image-a-21_1572217097674.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
