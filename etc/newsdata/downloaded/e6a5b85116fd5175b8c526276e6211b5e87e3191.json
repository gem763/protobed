This may not be right, but it is probably the easiest way to analyse the proposal: how does it differ from May\u2019s plan?\n\nThe first difference is that it means a customs border in Ireland. Whereas May\u2019s deal kept the whole of the UK in the EU customs territory until a long-term trade treaty was negotiated, Boris Johnson\u2019s plan is to take the whole of the UK out of it.\n\nThat means there would have to be customs checks on goods going between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic. The UK government proposal is that these would not happen at the border, but \u201cthe very small number of physical checks needed\u201d would be conducted at traders\u2019 premises or \u201cother designated locations\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

This sounds to them like the latest form of magical thinking, using technology that doesn\u2019t yet exist to manage a virtual border without any physical checkpoints or cameras at the border itself.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

There was a provision in May\u2019s withdrawal agreement for the transition period to be extended for a further year. It looks as if that will still be in the text of anything Johnson negotiates, but a UK government official briefed journalists this afternoon that the option to extend the transition period is \u201cnot one that we intend to use\u201d.\n\nEven so, Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU Commission president, hasn\u2019t rejected Johnson\u2019s plan. He is coming to the end of his term and would like to go out having secured a deal.\n\nThe second big difference between May\u2019s plan and Johnson\u2019s proposal is that the new plan depends on the consent of the assembly and the executive of Northern Ireland. Whereas May\u2019s protocol on the Irish border could be ended only by agreement between the EU and the UK, giving the EU a veto over it, this draft protocol would last as long as the institutions of Northern Ireland agreed to it.\n\nThis may be subtle politics. One oddity about May\u2019s deal and its backstop guarantee of an open border in Ireland was that it was popular among the people of Northern Ireland, even though it was opposed by the DUP, the only party represented in the House of Commons.\n\nThe backstop would have given Northern Ireland a favourable economic status, inside most of the EU single market, while also being part of the UK. Johnson\u2019s new Brexit protocol would do the same, but making it subject to a Northern Ireland veto could make it more acceptable to the DUP.\n\nIt is noticeable that the DUP sounded cautiously positive about the plan in its first response, which must have been choreographed with the government.\n\nThere is an obvious problem, which is that the devolved government in Northern Ireland has been suspended for nearly three years. That would mean the EU would have to agree to the UK leaving now on the prospect of an arrangement that would be approved later. That would mean betting not just that the Northern Ireland government would agree (which is likely), but that it would be restored, by July next year. That is when consent would be required for the protocol: six months before the end of the transition period.\n\nBut it is possible that this proposal could be the basis of a deal. Whether it is better or worse than May\u2019s deal is possibly neither here nor there. Jeremy Corbyn didn\u2019t vote for May\u2019s deal, and so if he doesn\u2019t vote for this one, Johnson will be no worse off.\n\nWhat is significant is that several of the Conservative Eurosceptics who voted against May\u2019s deal could vote for this, as could the DUP. If Johnson can persuade a handful of Labour MPs to vote for it too, it is just possible that he could win approval for it in the House of Commons.", "description": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s instant verdict on the government\u2019s Brexit proposal is that \u201cit\u2019s worse than Theresa May\u2019s deal\u201d.
