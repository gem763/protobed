REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain has made a constructive Brexit proposal to the European Union and is now willing to negotiate on the details to get a new exit deal with the bloc, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on getting a deal because we think this is the best way forward,\u201d Barclay said. \u201cThese are serious proposals and clearly we need to have a negotiation with the EU on taking them forward.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about a possible delay to Brexit, he said that it will require the consent of all the other 27 EU member states.\n\n\u201cThe risk of a no deal is obviously far less favorable than us leaving with a smooth and orderly way and if there was no deal obviously checks would need to put in place by the Irish government,\u201d he said.", "description": "Britain has made a constructive Brexit proposal to the European Union and is now willing to negotiate on the details to get a new exit deal with the bloc, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436537184&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920C0"}
