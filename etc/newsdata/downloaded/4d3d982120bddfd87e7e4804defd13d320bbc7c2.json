And his views and approaches to the principles of economics continue to resonate today.\n\nMore than two centuries later, economists have gained well-earned reputations for being argumentative on such complex issues as sustainability, globalization, and poverty. But most of the world's top economists spotlighted by UBS in Nobel Perspectives, the largest online repository of interviews with Nobel Laureates, share a common view: Economics has and will continue to play a significant role in identifying and solving some of the world's most important issues.\n\nAnd this year is an ideal time to reflect on the meaningful role economists play in our lives, as it marks the 50th anniversary of the first award of the Nobel award in economic sciences. Given that economists are in the business of prognosticating, here are a few trends identified by some Nobel Laureates that will likely shape economics' evolution and influence:\n\nA bigger role for women\n\nTraditionally a male-dominated field, economics has been slow to gain gender equity. But there are signs this disparity is, at last, starting to wane.\n\nThe only female Nobel Laureate in economic sciences, Elinor Ostrom, said during her award ceremony in 2009: \"We've ... entered a new era. We recognize that women have the capability to do great scientific work. I appreciate that it's an honor to be the first woman, but I won't be the last.\"\n\nA pioneer in big data and economics, Lucrezia Reichlin, professor of economics at London Business School, believes that a greater focus on mentoring and diversity will provide more role models for the next generation of economists: \"We are too inward-looking, talking to our colleagues, and not talking to the public at large enough. You have to have courage to change.\" (To read insights from top female economists, visit the UBS Women in Economics website.)\n\nIncreased focus on big data and analytics\n\nToday, as big data and analytics are transforming every industry, it's worthwhile to recall that \"One thing we can say is that economics as a field has become much more empirical over the last 30 years.\"\n\nSo says Richard H. Thaler, a behavioral economist awarded the Nobel award for economics in 2017. Given the field's longstanding use of and appreciation for data science and machine learning, Thaler believes future economists will work more often in the private sector than in the past, in e-commerce or other B2C markets.\n\nWhile technological inroads are significant, The 2010 Nobel Laureate Sir Christopher A. Pissarides understands why some banks and other institutions are moving cautiously with respect to blockchain and artificial intelligence. \"(Banks) are trusted by their clients. Once you have a relationship with people or big companies, you might think 'Why should I disturb this?' This is what you call social capital and you don't throw away social capital easily because the new technology has come along.\"\n\nEconomics as a tool to end conflict and foster peace\n\nSeveral Nobel Laureates are focusing on game theory \u2014 the study of how people, companies, or nations determine strategies in different situations \u2014 to better understand conflict to make the world a better, more peaceful place.\n\nFor example, Robert J. Aumann, a game theorist, mathematician, and Nobel Laureate in 2005, says that the fear of revenge and thus being attacked by weapons of mass destruction prevent both sides in a conflict from using them.\n\n\"If you dismiss things as being irrational, then you can't deal with them. You haven't helped the world,\" he says. \"You have to give proper incentives to the sides not to go to war. If you capitulate, then you're more likely to promote war than to avoid it.\"\n\nSimilarly, 2007 Nobel Laureate and game theorist Roger B. Myerson \u2014 a pioneer in the field of mechanism design theory \u2014 has focused much of his work on finding principles of international relations that will lead to a more peaceful world through mediation.\n\n\"Getting people to share information honestly and to exert hidden efforts appropriately are constraints that are part of the economic problem, just as much as the limited resources,\" he notes. \"Everybody in the world understood that trust was a problem in the past, but it wasn't part of the tools of economic analysis.\"\n\nPlaying a part in curing diseases\n\nAlvin E. Roth, the founding father of market design who was awarded the Nobel in 2012, has used applied game theory to match new doctors with hospitals, school children with schools, and kidney donors with patients.\n\nAs technological advancements and data science evolve, they will increasingly play a role in market design, too, unearthing a panorama of possibilities for linking non-traditional \"buyers\" and \"sellers.\"\n\nRoth foresees an even broader role for economics in general. \"Economics will evolve, the economy will evolve,\" he says. \"And we pass on the tradition. Trying to change it a little, to transform it while it is in our hands, but then it gets passed on to younger economists.\"\n\nThaler, a behavioral economist, sees advancements in technology playing a key role in further \"nudging\" individuals \u2014 and organizations \u2014 to make smarter choices in such areas as pension systems, consumer behavior and healthcare.\n\n\"My mantra in designing policies is if you want to get people to do something, make it easy,\" he says, citing as examples implanted chips to measure heartbeats or devices that automatically administer certain medications. \"We want to use that same strategy wherever we can.\"\n\nFor more insights on how economics is integrated into everything in life, visit UBS's Nobel Perspectives, where you'll find the stories of the brightest economic thinkers of our time.\n\nThis post was created by Insider Studios in partnership with UBS.\n\nThis article is for informational and educational purposes only and should not be relied upon as investment advice or the basis for making any investment decisions.
