Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cWhere there is a will, there is a deal \u2013 we have one,\u201d European Union President Jean-Claude Juncker tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and [Britain] and it is a testament to our commitment to find solutions. I recommend that [the European Commission] endorses this deal.\u201d\n\nThe EU Summit Thursday could lend approval to the deal and mark a breakthrough for the referendum that was passed by British voters in 2016.\n\nJohnson called on British lawmakers to approve the deal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a great new deal that takes back control \u2014 now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nBoth sides said the new deal dismisses the Irish \u201cbackstop,\u201d a measure to maintain a \u201csoft\u201d trade border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. In recent weeks, Johnson had proposed instead customs checkpoints on both sides of the border.\n\nThe prospects of getting the proposed agreement approved, however, are uncertain. The Democratic Unionist Party said immediately Thursday it won\u2019t support the proposal in Parliament. Many Conservative Party members have previously indicated they won\u2019t support a deal without the DUP.\n\nLabor Party leader Jeremy Corbyn blasted the proposed agreement and called for a second public referendum.\n\n\u201cFrom what we know, it seems the prime minister has negotiated an even worse deal than [former Prime Minister] Theresa May\u2019s, which was overwhelmingly rejected,\u201d he said. \u201cThese proposals risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: Putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights, and opening up our [health system] to a takeover by U.S. private corporations.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 17 (UPI) \u2014 On the day European Union and British negotiators were set to begin a Brexit summit in Belgium, the two sides said Thursday they", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
