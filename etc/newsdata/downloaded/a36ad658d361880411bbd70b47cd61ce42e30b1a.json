The branch was headed by David Wilkins, who promoted an \u201cincome machine\u201d strategy and split from Morgans in April 2011.\n\nThe strategy used options, which are contracts to buy or sell shares. \u201cThe strategy involved mainly clients holding a portfolio of shares and a cash account with a cash balance, clients then sell a number of put option contracts to generate income,\u201d the ASIC memo said.\n\n\u201c[A] review found a number of possible contraventions by the advisers concerned primarily inappropriate advice,\u201d it said.\n\nSome clients have since claimed they lost hundreds of thousands of dollars each.\n\nBut the toll from clients losses in the matter was \u201cunknown\u201d, the 2012 memo said.\n\n\u201cMorgans has been generally denying liability when claims have been lodged with it and referring clients to the [Financial Ombudsman Service] where it will take some time for the matters to be resolved,\u201d the memo said.\n\nThe memo comes despite Morgans own compliance reviews years earlier having found multiple problems at the branch. One Morgans email, detailed in a separate lawsuit, showed how top brass by February 2009 \u2013 three years earlier \u2013 had determined \u201cSpringwood have a one-size-fits-all policy \u2013 i.e. a trend towards a margin loans and options strategy\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nASIC banned Mr Wilkins from providing financial services for five years from 2015, saying he had engaged in misleading conduct by representing that \u201coptions trading carried little to no risk\u201d.\n\nAnother August 2013 email obtained by freedom of information, written to ASIC by Morgans director of legal and compliance Jennet Butler, was headlined \u201coptions business\u201d and highlighted problems with a former operation at the Gold Coast\u2019s Burleigh Heads. Ms Butler is not accused of wrongdoing.\n\nShe wrote ASIC had acknowledged Morgans' \u201cpro-active response in relation to the ex-Burleigh Heads operation but is mindful, given the serious and likely extended level of Corporations Act contraventions identified, that a more extensive, group-wide [Morgans] response may be required\u201d.\n\nASIC has not publicly linked any problems to that Morgans office.\n\nIt has banned trader Rodney Peters, who had worked there, from providing financial services for six years, ruling he had wrongly \u201crepresented to clients that he had authority to engage in discretionary trading\u201d. But ASIC said he was punished for actions that occurred between 2015 and 2016, three years after he left Morgans.\n\nThe freedom of information emails also list 2015 problems with derivatives trading with Michael Taylor from Morgans' Caloundra branch. Mr Taylor, who has previously maintained he tried to do the right thing by clients, was last year permanently banned by ASIC from providing financial services for problems occurring during his Morgans stint.\n\nLegal actions\n\nMorgans has been sued in dozens of former client actions in Queensland courts since 2013 for alleged problems in at least four branches. It has defended some matters but one lawsuit this year revealed it had also settled claims from more than 60 clients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing a series of problems across the organisation, ASIC and Morgans brokered an agreement in 2015 that resulted in the stockbroking outfit accepting restrictive licence conditions.\n\nRestrictions were lifted this year with praise about Morgans' reforms from a compliance consultant.\n\nASIC told the Financial Review when the licence conditions were imposed in 2015 that the breaches identified under the Corporations Act did not contain any \u201coffence or civil penalty provisions\u201d.\n\nGiven the options available in 2015, ASIC said it was satisfied that \u201clicence conditions were a strong regulatory outcome\u201d.\n\nCivil penalty proceedings would be an option under changes introduced in March this year, ASIC said.\n\nMorgans declined to answer questions but said it was \u201ccommitted to ensuring all clients receive an exceptional professional service\u201d.", "description": "Even as the stockbroker knew of breakdowns at a branch, an ASIC memo shows it was disputing client compensation claims.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.774%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9abe7191c961023f9b9ff9938f997f6b2f1d58dc", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
