We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn\u2019t look just like Winnie the Pooh at all.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s quite an \u2018apology\u2019 (Picture: Twitter)\n\nThey then urged people to tune into their 300th episode before continuing their message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Long live the Communist Party of China! May this autumn\u2019s sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?\u2019\n\nApparently it is now near impossible to find a trace of South Park anywhere on the Chinese internet \u2013 from Weibo, to Youku, to Tieba \u2013 any threads, discussions, clips and episodes have been removed or are no longer functional.\n\nThe Band in China episode featured a pair of storylines critical of China.\n\nSouth Park have never been known to shy away from controversy (Picture: South Park Studios)\n\nOne involves Randy getting caught attempting to sell weed in China and getting sent to a work camp similar to those Beijing has been using in Xinjiang Province to hold as many as a million Chinese Muslims for political indoctrination \u2013 where he runs into an imprisoned Winnie the Pooh.\n\nA second plot follows Stan, Jimmy, Kenny and Butters forming a metal band, which becomes popular and attracts the attention of a manager who wants to make a film about them but then the script keeps changing so the film can safely be distributed in China.\n\nThe harsh response is unsurprising given that China\u2019s government has even been known to censor any mention or appearance of Winnie the Pooh because he has become a symbol of the resistance, with local internet users compare Chinese president Xi Jinping to the character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Now I know how Hollywood writers feel,\u2019 Stan says at one point while a Chinese guard watches over him and alters his work while he writes the script.\n\nSeveral shots are taken at Disney, including a scene where Mickey Mouse shows up to make sure all his employees \u2013 other Marvel and Disney cartoon characters \u2013 play ball with the Chinese authorities.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
