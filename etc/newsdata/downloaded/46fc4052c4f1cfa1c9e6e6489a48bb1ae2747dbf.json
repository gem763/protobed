REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nCiting people familiar with the matter, the Journal said that by pursuing deals that would see major projects screened for weeks in theaters, the iPhone maker hopes to make it easier to attract big-name directors and producers.\n\nSofia Coppola\u2019s \u201cOn the Rocks\u201d, starring Bill Murray and produced in partnership with \u201cMoonlight\u201d producers A24, will be among Apple\u2019s first major theatrical releases in mid-2020, it said.\n\nApple, a late entrant to the streaming war, plans to launch Apple TV+ on Nov. 1 for $5 a month to compete with rivals such as Netflix Inc and Walt Disney\u2019s upcoming streaming offering, Disney+.\n\nBoth the rivals have deeper libraries and years of experience in making hit shows, but have taken varying approaches to how they release content.\n\nNetflix last year started debuting original films like \u201cRoma\u201d, \u201cBird Box\u201d and \u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs\u201d for limited runs in theaters, before bringing them on to the streaming service.\n\nBut it has struggled to come to terms with major theater chains, who would rather have films like Martin Scorsese\u2019s upcoming \u201cThe Irishman\u201d be screened months before they are released online.\n\nIn a victory for Netflix and other streaming services, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voted reut.rs/2Dvo8VG this year not to change its rules to demand Oscar nominees must play in theaters for a minimum period.\n\nSome prominent directors have also objected to the idea that their movies would be seen mostly on the small screen and Apple\u2019s move may help it compete with Hollywood studios for talent.\n\nThe iPhone maker is spending $2 billion on original content this year, but is still dwarfed by Netflix, which has a reported $10 billion budget for content and 151 million paid subscribers, as well as the major studios.\n\nApple did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nShares of the company were trading down marginally at $218.55 in afternoon trading.", "description": "Apple Inc plans to give its feature-length film productions extended theatrical releases before making them available on its streaming TV service, the Wall Street Journal reported https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-to-bring-feature-length-films-to-theaters-11569579632?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1 on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434506147&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0QF", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
