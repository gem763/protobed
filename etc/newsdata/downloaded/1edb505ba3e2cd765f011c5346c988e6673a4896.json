The Senate, however, isn\u2019t required to try the President. That chamber possesses the \u201csole power to try all impeachments,\u201d but is under no constitutional obligation to do so. The Democrats ignored House precedent and longstanding tradition to launch their \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d Why should Senate Republicans consider themselves bound by precedent and procedural rules where the trial is concerned?\n\nThe GOP can no longer afford to be timid about such niceties. The Democrats have long since declared war on Trump, the Republican Party, and the \u201cdeplorable\u201d voters who support them. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) pointed out on the floor of the Senate last week that the Democrats began making plans for President Trump\u2019s impeachment well before he was inaugurated. She noted that in December of 2016 the Democrats were already at work on a Senate bill whose sole purpose was to enable Democrats to exploit spurious conflict of interest allegations involving President-elect Trump\u2019s business dealings and his official duties.", "description": "", "authors": ["David Catron", "Spectator.Org Senate-Shouldnt-Dignify-Impeachment-Parody-With-A-Trial"], "top_image": ""}
