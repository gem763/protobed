As such, both firms said that they will vigorously defend themselves in any such action.\n\nIn its post, Bitfinex wrote:\n\n\u201cThese baseless accusations are an attempt to undermine the growth and success of the entire digital token community, of which Bitfinex and Tether are key parts. It is an attack on the work and dedication of not just Bitfinex's stakeholders, but thousands of our colleagues, too.\u201d\n\nTether is fully backed by reserves\n\nThe companies further outlined certain concepts of their business, claiming that neither Tether or their affiliates ever used Tether tokens or issuances to manipulate the cryptocurrency market or token pricing.\n\nTether added:\n\n\u201cAll Tether tokens are fully backed by reserves and are issued pursuant to market demand, and not for the purpose of controlling the pricing of crypto assets. It is irresponsible to suggest that Tether enables illicit activity due to its efficiency, liquidity and wide-scale applicability within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\u201d\n\nControversial history\n\nMeanwhile, Tether is known as a controversial topic in the crypto community, largely based on skepticism over Tether\u2019s reserve policy. Launched in 2014, Tether is the first-ever stablecoin to be backed by the United States dollar at 1:1 ratio. For the past two years, industry critics have speculated that Tether did not have the necessary cash reserves in its bank accounts to back the amount of USDT in circulation.\n\nAs reported, Tether has had an association with Bitfinex since 2015, when the exchange integrated the crypto operation into its exchange.\n\nWhile Tether has frequently attempted to prove that its token is backed by the appropriate amount of dollar holding, the controversial reports against the firm have continued to appear. As such, in August 2019, research by Augmento pointed out a forward d correlation between Tether sentiment, market capitalization and price, which could be manipulated or exploited to create arbitrage.", "description": "Tether and its affiliate exchange Bitfinex announce that they are prepared to fight lawsuits alleging that USDT is involved in market manipulation", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNzA4ZmQwODAzZTZhMGYzYTM3M2YxOWRlMWI4ZWM5MmIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
