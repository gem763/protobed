Parliament will debate and vote on Monday on whether to approve Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, the leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said.\n\nOn a day of high drama, lawmakers held the first Saturday sitting since the 1982 Argentine invasion of the Falklands, while hundreds of thousands of people gathered to march on parliament demanding another referendum on EU membership.\n\nProtesters gathered outside the parliament building cheered as lawmakers voted in favor of Letwin\u2019s amendment.\n\nAMENDMENT\n\nThe amendment proposed that a decision on whether to back a Brexit deal be deferred until all the legislation needed to implement it has been passed through parliament.\n\nJohnson believes this can be achieved by Oct. 31. Others think it would need a short \u2018technical\u2019 delay in Britain\u2019s departure from the EU to pass the legislation.\n\nA law already passed by Johnson\u2019s opponents obliges him to ask the EU for a Brexit delay until Jan. 31, 2020 if he could not secure approval for his deal by the end of Saturday, however Britain could still leave on Oct. 31 if parliament manages to pass all the necessary legislation by that date.\n\nLetwin said earlier that he hoped Johnson\u2019s deal would succeed, but he wanted \u201can insurance policy which prevents the UK from crashing out on 31 October by mistake if something goes wrong during the passage of the implementing legislation\u201d.\n\nThree years after the country voted 52-48% to leave the European project, many Britons say they are bored with the whole Brexit argument and just want the process to end. But others demonstrating on Saturday remain angry that Britain is leaving the EU and want that reversed.\n\nHannah Barton, 56, a cider maker from Derbyshire in central England, was draped in the EU flag. \u201cI am incensed that we are not being listened to,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe feel that we are voiceless. This is a national disaster waiting to happen and it is going to destroy the economy.\u201d\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, backed a second referendum.\n\n\u201cVoting for a deal today won\u2019t end Brexit. It won\u2019t deliver certainty and the people should have the final say,\u201d Corbyn told parliament.\n\n\u2018SUPER SATURDAY\u2019\n\nBrexit \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d topped a frenetic week which saw Johnson confound his opponents by clinching a new Brexit deal.\n\nWhen it comes to a vote in a divided parliament where he has no majority, Johnson must win the support of 320 lawmakers to pass his deal.\n\nIf he wins, Johnson will go down in history as the leader who delivered a Brexit - for good or bad - that pulls the United Kingdom far out of the EU\u2019s orbit.\n\nShould he fail, Johnson will face the humiliation of Brexit unraveling after repeatedly promising that he would get it done - \u201cdo or die\u201d - by Oct. 31.\n\nJohnson won the top job by staking his career on getting Brexit done by the latest deadline of Oct. 31 after his predecessor, Theresa May, was forced to delay the departure date. Parliament rejected her deal three times, by margins of between 58 and 230 votes earlier this year.\n\nHe says lawmakers face the option of either approving the deal or propelling the United Kingdom to a disorderly no-deal exit that could divide the West, hurt global growth and bring renewed violence to Northern Ireland.\n\nTo win, Johnson must persuade enough Brexit-supporting rebels in both his Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party to back his deal. His Northern Irish allies and the three main opposition parties oppose it.\n\nIn a boost for Johnson, some influential hardline Brexit supporters such as Mark Francois and Iain Duncan Smith have said they will support the deal.\n\nSteve Baker, the head of a hardline Brexit faction in the Conservative Party, has told his European Research Group allies they should vote for Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Brexit\u2019s \u2018Super Saturday\u2019 - here)\n\n(GRAPHIC: British lawmakers switching sides - here)\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\n(GRAPHIC: Understanding Brexit - here)\n\n(GRAPHIC: Understanding the Irish border - here)", "description": "A defiant Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would not negotiate a further delay to Britain's departure from the European Union after losing a vote in parliament on Saturday that means he is obliged to request a postponement.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442629448&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I085", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
