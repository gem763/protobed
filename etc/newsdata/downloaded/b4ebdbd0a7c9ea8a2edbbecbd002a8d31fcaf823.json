This is always a difficult ground to go to and we just didn\u2019t take the chances we made,\u201d he told a news conference.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t create enough chances but we created big moments that we didn\u2019t make the most of. It\u2019s a good group to work with, they are determined although sometimes along the road you\u2019ll hit some bumps.\n\n\u201cThey want to do what we\u2019re working on in training, but today key moments tipped the game in West Ham\u2019s favour. We made some bad final passes and lacked quality in decision making, execution.\u201d\n\nThe Norwegian coach added that he expected Rashford to be \u201cout for a while\u201d with the groin injury he sustained, but said Martial and Greenwood should return in time for next Monday\u2019s game at home to Arsenal.\n\nIn contrast to Manchester United\u2019s nosedive in form since beating Chelsea 4-0 on the opening day of the season, West Ham have made considerable progress since they were hammered 5-0 by Manchester City in their first game.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cI think we deserved the three points today, I\u2019m happy with everything we did, we should aim to play like this every week,\u201d said coach Manuel Pellegrini.\n\n\u201cWe played consistently throughout the game, we didn\u2019t allow them to create chances. It\u2019s always important when you beat a team like Manchester United, and it\u2019s what we deserve for how hard everyone is working from the coaching staff to the players.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how far we can go but we think we\u2019ll have the chance to achieve something big.\u201d", "description": "West Ham United beat a toothless Manchester United 2-0 at home on Sunday to move into fourth place in the Premier League as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side ended the game without an established striker after Marcus Rashford came off injured.", "authors": ["Richard Martin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432681638&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0LG", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
