Pupils are being given an 'Autumn dance' instead.\n\nThe parent council at St David's RC Primary School in Edinburgh (pictured) has decided children are not allowed to dress up for Halloween as it is not inclusive for all children\n\nThe parent council said 'children would be able to dress as they wished' and claimed it will 'not put any additional strain on family budgets and be inclusive of all students'.\n\nBut one angry parent told the Edinburgh Evening News there were 'only two' parents in attendance at the parent council meeting.\n\nThey said: 'St David's Primary is situated right next to Pirniehall Primary School.\n\n'Last year it was so lovely to see the other kids from Pirniehall having fun and ours weren't allowed to because we were told the decision had been made by the parent council to not let the kids dress up because 'some families don't celebrate Halloween.'\n\n'I felt so sad for the kids. No religion or politics should interfere with children.\n\n'It feels like back to the dark century where children have no voice and parents can decide everything they do for them.'\n\nThe school is described on its website as 'multicultural, friendly and inclusive', teaching religious education on all faiths - including Catholicism.\n\nThe furious parent added: 'Throughout the year the children are taught about other religions; they go to mosques, they learn about celebrating Ramadan and more.\n\n'I am shocked, we are living in Edinburgh one of the most tolerant cities in the UK, but we have been told our children can't celebrate Halloween at school because 'it's not our culture'. How is it that this decision has come down to two parents?'\n\nProblems began last year when parents were advised not to send their children to school dressed up the night before Halloween.\n\nThe Catholic school shares a campus - including a shared dining hall - with the non-denominational Pirniehall Primary School, where children are allowed to dress up.

Sadly, the issue of Halloween has become quite contentious and this also played a part in our decision.\n\n'As a parent council we should always look to be neutral and non-controversial.'\n\nA council spokesman has defended the position and said: 'Parents councils take account of different views when making decisions about after school activities in order to meet the needs of as many families as possible.'", "description": "The parent council at St David's RC Primary School in Edinburgh took the decision because they believe Halloween celebrations are not inclusive for children of all backgrounds.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19545110-0-image-a-95_1570719986912.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
