But against an energised and repurposed Irish side, it was the hosts who ultimately stepped away from this clash with question marks over their heads.\n\nLosing 22-17 against Joe Schmidt\u2019s men, Wales failed to hit the heights they\u2019ve proved their capable of in what was their first home defeat since November 2017. Despite ending with a flourish, the 2019 Six Nations champions left it too late to overturn their opponents who, from the off, looked the superior side in this World Cup warm-up.\n\nAdmittedly, it was a pick-and-mix starting XV that ran out here at the Principality Stadium, with much focus on 23-year-old fly-half Jarrod Evans and other inexperienced starters given their chance to shine as Gatland considers his options ahead of Japan.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Indeed, by the half-way stage Wales had missed 20 tackles compared to Ireland\u2019s four. It was a clear indicator of the gulf in quality between the two teams.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Leon Brown, who had replaced Samson Lee in the front row, was sin-binned by referee Romain Poite for a scrummaging offence just 11 minutes after going on, allowing Ireland to enjoy territorial dominance through a powerful set-piece.\n\nThe visitors went on to blow a scoring chance when Jack Carty's pass to Adam Conway was ruled forward but Romain Poite soon awarded them a penalty try, opening up a 19-point advantage.\n\nSuch a setback seemed to bring the fighting spirit out of Wales, with Rhys Patchell and debutant Owen Lane eventually crossing the white line to close the gap.\n\nBut by this point, the damage had been done. There was to be no way back for Wales, meaning Gatland\u2019s final home game as head coach ended in the disappointment of defeat.", "description": "Warren Gatland had spoken openly before this match of the opportunity his players had to further dent Ireland\u2019s fragile confidence after their Twickenham humiliation.
