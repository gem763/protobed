Kerry Roberts deemed colleges and universities a \u201cliberal breeding ground\u201d during a furious rant on his radio show Sept. 2 while discussing SB 1236 \u2015 a proposal for a total ban on abortions in Tennessee, which would outlaw the procedure from the moment a woman knows she is pregnant.\n\nUsing his conservative platform to rally support for the bill, Roberts recalled a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing he attended in August in which a woman testified against the measure.\n\n\u201cWe got some woman in there who just goes off,\u201d the state senator said, giving his account of the scene in footage of his program posted on Facebook. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all about \u2014 pick every, every liberal bit of indoctrination that you can get in a university setting today. Far left \u2014 I mean, you\u2019ve got all of these \u2018intersectionalities\u2019 and \u2018white supremacy\u2019 and \u2018oppressive this\u2019 and every buzzword in the liberal lexicon is being thrown at us by some woman who\u2019s not even talking about the legal argument; she\u2019s just going off on something.\u201d\n\nBecoming visibly angered, Roberts then began shouting into the microphone, declaring it was time to do away with colleges and universities.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that we can to do to save America today, it is to get rid of our institutions of higher education right now, and cut the liberal breeding ground off,\u201d he said. \u201cGood grief!\u201d\n\nThough Roberts did not identify the woman he was describing, it appears to have been Cherisse Scott, CEO and founder of SisterReach, a pro-choice nonprofit organization based in Memphis. During the hearing, Scott spoke out against the bill and was repeatedly interrupted before being cut off completely.\n\nThe source of Scott\u2019s views, Roberts suggested, was higher education.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s learned all of this stuff that flies in the face of what we stand for as a country, and here we are as legislators paying for this garbage to be taught to our children,\u201d he said, claiming that the \u201cmurder\u201d of innocent people is \u201cthe price we pay.\u201d\n\nHowever, on Monday, he downplayed his tirade, arguing that it was meant to be taken as a joke.\n\n\u201cMy listeners clearly understood the humor and hyperbole of it,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cThat was a week ago. But today, it\u2019s a news story. \u2018Tennessee Lawmaker Calls For Elimination of Higher Education\u2019 the headline screams! That\u2019s hyperbole, too.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the anti-abortion bill is likely unconstitutional, but for Roberts, that\u2019s the idea.\n\nJust before the hearing, the state senator told CBS News he believes it could become \u201ca vehicle to lead the Supreme Court to consider, I hope, overturning or at least chipping away at Roe v. Wade,\u201d the landmark case that established access to safe and legal abortion as a constitutional right.", "description": "Tennessee state Sen.\u00a0Kerry Roberts denounced colleges and universities as a \u201cliberal breeding ground\u201d\u00a0during his radio show last week.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d77e4bd3b0000c49fd0c5a2.jpeg?cache=iaonf9rznx&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
