Thank you.\n\nThe actress has been single and not ready to mingle since splitting with former husband, Justin Theroux, in 2017, and has more than enough on her plate without adding another man to things.\n\nAsked whether she was enjoying being single, the 50-year-old actress recently said: \u2018Yeah, and I\u2019m very busy. For now. I\u2019m promoting [The Morning Show]. I\u2019m prepping for next season.\u2019\n\nSee, busy.\n\nJennifer and Justin split in 2017 (Picture: Broadimage/REX )\n\nJen just isn\u2019t interested in dating at the moment, because she has too much on her plate with her career, and she definitely has no interest in letting her friends set her up on a date either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the thought of a blind date, Jennifer said she \u2018hates it\u2019 when people try to play matchmaker for her.\n\nChatting to Howard Stern on SiriusXM, she added: \u2018Hey, listen, I just don\u2019t like being set up. I don\u2019t like it. I hate it.\u2019\n\nLast year, sources said the star wasn\u2019t \u2018concerned about dating\u2019 following her split from Justin, two years after marrying in 2015.\n\nThe insider said: \u2018She isn\u2019t concerned about dating. She is happy to focus on work.\n\n\u2018She doesn\u2019t even talk about [Justin] anymore. She doesn\u2019t keep up with what he does. She is focusing on her own life.\u2019\n\nAnd fair play to her.\n\nMeanwhile, Jennifer \u2013 who was also married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005 \u2013 previously revealed she is \u2018not heartbroken\u2019 over her separation from 48-year-old actor Justin.\n\nShe said: \u2018The misconceptions are \u201cJen can\u2019t keep a man,\u201d and \u201cJen refuses to have a baby because she\u2019s selfish and committed to her career.\u201d Or that I\u2019m sad and heartbroken. First, with all due respect, I\u2019m not heartbroken.\n\n\u2018And second, those are reckless assumptions. No one knows what\u2019s going on behind closed doors. No one considers how sensitive that might be for my partner and me. They don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve been through medically or emotionally.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
