Others lay in foetal positions on the ground, their wrists tied behind their backs, after being subdued with pepper spray and batons.\n\n\u201cThe anti-mask law just fuels our anger and more will people come on to the street,\u201d Lee, a university student wearing a blue mask, said on Sunday, as he marched on Hong Kong island.\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid of the new law, we will continue fighting. We will fight for righteousness. I put on the mask to tell the government that I\u2019m not afraid of tyranny.\u201d\n\nAuthorities had braced for two major protests on Sunday, fearing a recurrence of Friday night\u2019s violent protests which saw the Asian financial centre virtually shut down the next day.\n\nRelated Coverage Hong Kong police fire tear gas as protesters defy emergency law\n\nOnly hours after Hong Kong\u2019s embattled leader Carrie Lam invoked emergency powers last used more than 50 years ago, mask-wearing protesters took to the streets on Friday, setting subway stations on fire, smashing mainland China banks and clashing with police.\n\nThe rallies on Sunday on Hong Kong island and across the harbour in Kowloon had been largely peaceful until police began to try and disperse the crowds, saying they were participating in unlawful assemblies, blocking major roads, and ordered protesters to leave immediately.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s four months of protests have plunged the Chinese-ruled city into its worst political crisis in decades and pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power six years ago.\n\nWhat started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has swelled into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing\u2019s increasing grip on the city, undermining its \u201cone country, two systems\u201d status promised when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.\n\nChina dismisses the accusation, saying foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, have fanned anti-China sentiment.\n\nProtesters on Sunday chanted \u201cHong Kongers, revolt\u201d and \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong\u201d, as riot police monitored them from overhead walkways and footbridges, some taking photographs and filming the marchers.\n\nAnti-government protesters attend a demonstration in Wan Chai district, in Hong Kong, China October 6, 2019.

Umbrellas are a symbol of an earlier pro-democracy movement, but were being used on Sunday simply to keep off the rain.\n\nProtesters handed out face masks to encourage people to defy the ban. One masked protester carried a mask-wearing \u201cBuzz Lightyear\u201d doll from Walt Disney Co\u2019s (DIS.N) \u201cToy Story\u201d animation film.\n\nAs the day wore on protesters started to target subway stations and China banks, just as they did on Friday, which forced the unprecedented closure of the city\u2019s metro railway.\n\nA branch of China Construction Bank (Asia) near Prince Edward station was vandalised on Sunday with \u201cNo China\u201d sprayed on it\u2019s wall. Wan Chai station, closed with a neon sign saying serious vandalism, had a protester sheet draped over it which read: \u201cthis way to HELL\u201d.\n\nProtesters set alight a blaze at the Mong Kok MTR station, with a placard nearby reading: \u201cIf we burn, you burn with us\u201d.\n\nFriday night\u2019s \u201cextreme violence\u201d justified the use of emergency laws, Beijing-backed Lam said on Saturday, but the laws have sparked further violent protests.\n\nThe current \u201cprecarious situation\u201d, which endangered public safety, left no timely solution but the anti-mask law, Matthew Cheung, Hong Kong\u2019s chief secretary, wrote on his blog on Sunday. He urged people to oppose violence ahead of grassroots district council elections set for Nov. 24.\n\nSlideshow (21 Images)\n\nFour months of protests has pushed the Asian financial hub to the brink of its first recession in a decade.\n\nHong Kong may have lost as much as $4 billion in deposits to rival financial hub Singapore from June through August, Goldman Sachs estimated this week.\n\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan in a blog on Sunday said despite recent obstacles, the banking system remained sound and the financial market was functioning well.\n\n\u201cHong Kong will not implement foreign exchange controls. The Hong Kong dollar can be exchanged freely and capital can come in and out freely. This is the solemn guarantee of the Basic Law,\u201d said Chan.", "description": "Hong Kong police and protesters clashed on Sunday as tens of thousands marched through the central city wearing face masks in defiance of colonial-era emergency powers which threaten them with a year in prison for hiding their faces.", "authors": ["Donny Kwok", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437670238&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF9508D", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
