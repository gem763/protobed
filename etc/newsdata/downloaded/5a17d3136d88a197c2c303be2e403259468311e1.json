The victim of the crash, which took place in February, was Omar Awan, a 48-year-old anesthesiologist who lost control of his vehicle in a south Florida parkway and collided with a palm tree according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed in Broward County.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, a police officer was unable to open the doors to Awan\u2019s vehicle due to Tesla\u2019s special retractable door handles. As a result, the officer and bystanders watched unable to do anything as the car filled with smoke and flames which the lawsuit alleges originated from the car\u2019s battery. Tesla car door handles retract into the vehicle and pop out or \u201cauto-present\u201d as Tesla states when the vehicle\u2019s key fob is detected nearby.\n\nThe lawsuit states: \u201cFire engulfed the car and burned Dr. Awan beyond recognition \u2014 all because the Model S has inaccessible door handles, no other way to open the doors, and an unreasonably dangerous fire risk.\u201d The complaint lists smoke inhalation as the cause of Awan\u2019s death and states that he had not sustained any internal injuries or broken bones in the initial crash.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Awan\u2019s car continued to burn for hours and reignited several times even after firefighters had extinguished the flames. This is not the first time that a Tesla vehicle has burst into flames following a crash, in August a Tesla Model 3 vehicle burst into flames following a collision with a parked tow truck in Moscow.\n\nAwan\u2019s case is Awan v. Tesla Inc., 19-021110, Circuit Court of Broward County, Florida.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
