It marked the steepest factory price decline July 2016, but was in line with expectations.\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) increased 3% year-on-year in September, compared with the expectation of a 2.9% gain. Pork prices in China jumped 69.3% from a year ago. It is the major driver in the overall increase in CPI.\n\nThe country also reported weaker-than-expected trade data this week, which showed the sharpest drop in imports since 2016.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies last traded at 98.137, down 0.03%.\n\nThe USD/JPY pair inched down 0.1% to 108.32.\n\nThe AUD/USD pair and the NZD/USD pair were both little changed.\n\nThe GBP/USD pair rose 0.2% to 1.2629. Brexit developments remained in focus after the European Union showed some cool reaction to the U.K.\u2019s proposals on resolving the Irish border-related elements of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nThe EU\u2019s top negotiator Michel Barnier reportedly told EU diplomats at the weekend that the proposals represented an \u201cuntested\u201d risk that were not acceptable, according to The Guardian.", "description": "Forex - Yuan Trades Lower Amid Renewed Trade Concerns", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE0A0MX_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
