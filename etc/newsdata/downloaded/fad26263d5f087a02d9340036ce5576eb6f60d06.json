Take This Quiz", "language": "en", "text": "Think you have a secure password? Well, odds are you don\u2019t. Even basic, rudimentary rules of passwords are often ignored, say experts such as Lorrie Cranor, a professor of computer science and of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University and former chief technologist at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\n\nTake this quiz to find out how much you know\u2014or don\u2019t know\u2014about the latest in password security.\n\n1. How often do hacking-related data breaches leverage stolen or weak passwords?\n\nA. 10% of the time.\n\nB. 27% of the time.\n\nC. 63% of the time.\n\nD. 81% of the time.\n\nAnswer: D. That figure comes from a 2017 data-breach investigations report by Verizon Communications .\n\n2. Common words and phrases are safe for passwords as long as they:\n\nA. Are easy for you to remember.\n\nB. Are at least 12 characters long and include a number and punctuation mark.\n\nC. Are in a language other than English.\n\nD. None of the above. They aren\u2019t ever safe.\n\nAnswer: D. Common phrases aren\u2019t safe, yet the usual suspects\u2014variations on \u201cpassword,\u201d \u201cletmein\u201d and \u201ciloveyou\u201d\u2014are still in heavy rotation. Using common phrases in uncommon languages isn\u2019t much better, according to Dr. Cranor. \u201cPeople think they\u2019re really clever, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oooh, I did it in Swahili,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cBut it still says, \u2018I love you.\u2019 \u201d\n\n3. If you\u2019re struggling to come up with a secure password, you should:\n\nA. Use a password generator.\n\nB. Use your favorite song.\n\nC. Use a pattern of keys such as ASDFG on your keyboard.\n\nD. Ask a stranger for his wife\u2019s date of birth.\n\nAnswer: A. Dr. Cranor says many people assume that if they use personal information, such as a favorite song, sports team or movie, their password is safe because criminals don\u2019t know them. But that isn\u2019t how hackers work, she says. \u201cMany password attacks occur with attackers guessing billions of passwords,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t know anything about you, but they have an algorithm that guesses things, so if your password is a common song, it\u2019s going to be guessed.\u201d\n\nAs for keyboard patterns, she says literally every one is in every password-hacking dictionary.\n\n4. Should you use a password manager?\n\nA. Yes, they are secure.\n\nB. No. One password can be used to access all of your other passwords.\n\nC. No. Often they\u2019re a backdoor scam to collect your passwords.\n\nD. No. They\u2019re for lazy people who can\u2019t manage their own passwords.\n\nAnswer: A. In a typical password manager, you use one password to access all of your other passwords, which are encrypted. That works well, as long as you make the master password a really good one that was created by a password generator.\n\nPhoto: Jon Krause\n\n5. It\u2019s a bad idea to write passwords down because:\n\nA. You could lose your scrap of paper.\n\nB. Someone could find your passwords.\n\nC. Alexa can read your writing.\n\nD. Go ahead and write them down. It\u2019s OK.\n\nAnswer: D. Experts used to advise against writing down passwords, Dr. Cranor says. But, she says, \u201cas long as they\u2019re written down and stored securely, there\u2019s actually really not much wrong with writing them down. And writing them down is a better coping mechanism than most of the other things that people do, which is generally to create bad passwords and use the same bad password everywhere.\u201d\n\n6. Which of the following is a password once used by the magician Teller, of the duo Penn & Teller, and is it a strong password?\n\nA. PennStateOfMind\n\nB. Telleraboutit\n\nC. Tellereverythingyoufeel\n\nD. MofoKnows666\n\nAnswer: D. Mofo the Psychic Gorilla was a talking gorilla head that read minds in the Penn & Teller show dating back to the early 1980s. \u201cMofo would often exclaim, \u2018Mofo knows!\u2019 after getting a correct reading, which was done with trickery, as all psychic readings are,\u201d Teller explains, adding that \u201c666 is, of course, the mark of the beast.\u201d Dr. Cranor says that while it is a pretty strong password\u201412 characters long, with three types of characters and an uppercase letter in the middle\u2014it isn\u2019t strong for Teller, because \u201cMofo knows\u201d is associated with him and 666 isn\u2019t an uncommon number.\n\n7. You can use the same password for more than one account. True or False?\n\nA. True.\n\nB. False.\n\nC. True, but only if you have a really strong password.\n\nD. True, but only if you use it for accounts that aren\u2019t important.\n\nAnswer: D. Dr. Cranor says that you can use the same password for accounts that you really don\u2019t care about and that can\u2019t be used to gain access to other accounts. \u201cOther than that,\u201d she says, \u201cyou should really have a separate password for everything.\u201d\n\n8. Who is considered a father of the computer password?\n\nA. Fernando Corbat\u00f3\n\nB. Alan Turing\n\nC. Bill Gates\n\nD. Ada Lovelace\n\nAnswer: A. Fernando Corbat\u00f3 helped create the first computer password at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1960s. He died in July at age 93.\n\n9. Which of the following passwords is best?\n\nA. ilovecats\n\nB. EyeLuvKatzs3MeatPlatter\n\nC. iloveKatzs123\n\nD. EyeLuvKatzs3MeatPlatter!WithAllPastrami\n\nAnswer: B. This password, based on an order available from Katz\u2019s Delicatessen in New York, uses both numbers and characters, which is recommended, and avoids simply tacking the numbers onto the end, which criminals have figured out, Dr. Cranor says. She also suggests avoiding passwords that are too complicated. \u201cThe downside of D,\u201d Dr. Cranor says, \u201cis that it is probably difficult to both remember and type.\u201d\n\n10. How much longer does it take to crack a 12-character password drawn from uppercase and lowercase letters, the 10 digits and 10 symbols versus one with just six lowercase letters?\n\nA. 62 times longer\n\nB. 62,000 times longer\n\nC. 62 million times longer\n\nD. 62 trillion times longer\n\nAnswer: D. In a recent article in Scientific American, French computer scientist Jean-Paul Delahaye wrote that \u201ca computer running through all the possibilities for your 12-character password one by one would take 62 trillion times longer\u201d than a password consisting only of six lowercase letters.\n\n11. On average, how many online accounts do people have that require passwords?\n\nA. 3\n\nB. 9\n\nC. 23\n\nD. 400\n\nAnswer: C. According to a 2018 McAfee survey, respondents said they used an average of 13 unique passwords for their 23 online accounts.\n\n12. What\u2019s the most common way Americans keep track of their passwords?\n\nA. Writing them down on paper.\n\nB. Memorizing them.\n\nC. Saving them in their internet browser.\n\nD. Using a password manager.\n\nAnswer: B. According to \u201cAmericans and Cybersecurity,\u201d a 2017 report released by the Pew Research Center, 86% of Americans keep track of passwords by memorizing them.\n\n13. How many hours a year do employees spend resetting passwords?\n\nA. About 2 hours\n\nB. Roughly 3 hours\n\nC. Around 18 hours\n\nD. More than 24 hours\n\nAnswer: C. One indication comes from a 2014 study conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The study found that U.S. Department of Commerce employees who are required to reset passwords every 60 days could spend, on average, as much as 18.6 hours a year doing it. Employees required to reset their passwords every 90 days spend closer to 12 hours. According to the study, DOC employees have an average of nine accounts at work that require logins.\n\nMr. Kornelis is a writer in Seattle.
