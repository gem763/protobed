There\u2019s been a few better moments since then,\u2019 he says.\n\nIt\u2019s been a surprising and special 18 months for wicketkeeper-batsman Robinson, who this summer established himself as a key player for Kent in all formats and a genuine asset with both the bat and gloves.\n\nRobinson discussed his career and playing with Kent stars Sam Billings and Darren Stevens (Picture: Getty)\n\nAfter signing his first professional contract in September 2017, Robinson had to wait almost a year before making his first-class debut. Playing as a specialist batsman at No. 7, the then-teenager scored 26 in his only innings as Kent smashed Leicestershire to boost their promotion hopes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobinson played two more red-ball matches that summer but few could have foreseen his development over the last six months.\n\nImpressing in all formats, he finished the 2019 season with over 1,000 runs \u2013 786 of which came in Division One of the County Championship \u2013 and 71 dismissals behind the stumps.\n\n\u2018From a personal point of view, I was chuffed with how the season went,\u2019 the 20-year-old says. \u2018I didn\u2019t expect it.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t expect to play any white-ball cricket at all really so that was obviously a huge bonus. Overall I\u2019m just pleased with how the summer went. I\u2019ve got to try and replicate that next year and keep on improving.\u2019\n\nAnd how does he plan to achieve that?\n\nThe Sidcup-born star finished the season with 71 dismissals (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018If I look back at the season honestly, I think I need to be a little bit more consistent. I want to be more consistent. If you look at my scores, they tended to be either 100, 80 or not a lot.\n\n\u2018If you can turn those 10s and 20s into 30s and 40s, then everything else moves up and you can go about scoring 1,000 runs in the season.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s something Zak [Crawley] has done really well this year. He got a lot of 30s and 40s that might not have be the prettiest but were still decent scores for the team. I\u2019m not setting any specific goals at this stage \u2013 I didn\u2019t really set a goal for this season \u2013 but I want to improve.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two highlights of Robinson\u2019s summer \u2013 from a personal perspective, at least \u2013 were undoubtedly his brace of first-class centuries.\n\nThe first \u2013 a fluent, match-defining 143 against Warwickshire \u2013 came in April. A little over a month later, he made 103 against a Yorkshire attack that included former South Africa bowler Duanne Olivier, ex-England star Tim Bresnan and county legend Steven Patterson.\n\n\ud83e\udd32 GRAB | Great low catch from @OllieRobinson7 to help dismiss Fisher!@harrypod23 gets the wicket and Yorkshire are eight down LIVE MATCH CENTRE \u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/25sPGZr6eP #SuperKent pic.twitter.com/kjqqyW1ibP \u2014 Kent Cricket (@KentCricket) September 19, 2019\n\n\u2018Scoring my first first-class hundred was special, it was a great day,\u2019 Robinson says. \u2018I wasn\u2019t really spoken about before the season, so to justify my selection and to prove a few people wrong was nice.\n\n\u2018I think the Yorkshire hundred was the better one. If you look at the attack and the way I played, it was completely different than the Warwickshire game. It was a battle. It was a lively pitch but I managed to scrap my way to a hundred.\u2019\n\nIt is easy to see why Robinson did not expect to feature regularly for Kent this season. In Sam Billings, the county already possessed a superb wicketkeeper-batsman who had represented his country and featured in the Indian Premier League.\n\nBut Billings dislocated his shoulder at the start of the season and that presented Robinson with an opportunity. He took it with both hands and his rise was such that, when Billings returned later in the summer, it was to play alongside Robinson rather than to replace him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Billings, Robinson not only has a hugely talented team-mate and captain, but a perfect role model.\n\nIn Billings, Robinson has an ideal role model (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018You try and learn things off everyone in the team but even more so off someone like Sam who has done a similar job to me and been very successful,\u2019 Robinson adds.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with Sam this year and we\u2019ve had quite a few conversations about the game. He\u2019s a good role model for sure.\u2019\n\nBillings, who last played for England in March, will surely add to his 36 caps this winter after being selected in the T20 squad for the tour to New Zealand.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sure that\u2019s his goal,\u2019 Robinson says. \u2018Sam is a great player so I\u2019m sure he can get back in the England team now he\u2019s fit. Everyone knows how good he is, and he showed it with three hundreds in a row at the end of the season.\u2019\n\nRobinson also speaks highly of another Kent team-mate, one who made his first-class debut before he was even born.\n\nRobinson is glad to see Stevens extend his stay at Kent (Picture: Getty)\n\nDarren Stevens, 43, has scored over 26,000 runs and taken almost 800 wickets in a remarkable county career that began in 1997. He looked set to leave Kent at the end of the season but earned a contract extension after a brilliant finish to the summer.\n\n\u2018Playing with Darren is great,\u2019 says Robinson. \u2018Everyone looks up to him. He\u2019s just a great guy to have around and obviously a legend at Kent. We get on well, he\u2019s a funny guy. He\u2019s an incredible player, too.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was Stevens\u2019 heroics at Headingley last month that finally convinced Kent to offer him a new deal.\n\nThe all-rounder obliterated Yorkshire with a brutal double century, before taking seven wickets in an emphatic win which helped Division One new-boys Kent finish fourth in the top-flight of the County Championship.\n\nRobinson recalls: \u2018That was one of the most ridiculous things I\u2019ve ever seen. He was pretty tired when he got to about 140, so from then on it was just an absolute onslaught.\n\n\u2018I think everyone was thinking after that game, \u201csurely he will sign a new deal now\u201d and he did which is great because he\u2019s still a top player.\u2019\n\nRobinson was Kent\u2019s third leading run-scorer in all competitions (Picture: Getty)\n\nAfter discussing county cricket veteran Stevens, the conversation returns to Robinson\u2019s fledgling career.\n\n\u2018I always wanted to become a professional cricketer,\u2019 he says. \u2018And I always believed I could\u2026 but it was just that little bit extra that you have to give to get there.\n\n\u2018The first time I realised I might make it was when I got picked for a pre-season trip to West Indies. I was obviously around the squad a lot and I remember thinking, \u201cI\u2019ve got a chance here\u2026\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s gone pretty well since then.\u2019\n\nOllie Robinson has certainly come a long way since scoring fifties for Kent U11s.", "description": "On the Kent County Cricket Club website, each first-team player has a profile page in which they reveal, amongst other things, their proudest moment in the sport.
