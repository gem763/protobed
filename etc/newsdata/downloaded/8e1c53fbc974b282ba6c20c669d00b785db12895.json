The group had been drinking Amaretto together throughout the day at the Fat Fox in Watlington.\n\nThey had been informed that the victim, identified as being one of the \u2018Thame lot\u2019 from 10 miles away, was on his way to Co-op in Watlington.\n\nClifton started the attack because he believed his girlfriend of four years had dumped him because of the victim.\n\nKieran Clifton led the attack and was given a 12-month jail term suspended for a year (Picture: HNP)\n\nJoshua Campbell was given 12 months suspended for a year (Picture: HNP)\n\nHe ran towards him shouting \u2018get out of the f**king car. I\u2019m going to smash your head in.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, his bravado slipped when he arrived in court with his lawyer Jane Brady telling Judge Nigel Daly at Oxford Crown Court: \u2018It is fair to say he is absolutely terrified of going inside.\n\nHumpback whale spotted swimming in Thames has died\n\n\u2018His mother would have concerns about her son\u2019s ability to cope in such an environment.\u2019\n\nClifford was praised by his own lawyer for having abstained from cocaine for two weeks ahead of being sentenced. Previously he spent \u00a3400 a week on cocaine and cannabis.\n\nCampbell\u2019s lawyer said he should not be jailed because \u2018he feels rehabilitated already\u2019.\n\nMeanwhile Smith\u2019s lawyer said he \u2018absolutely regrets the decisions that were taken and what unfolded.\u2019\n\nDaniel Clifford was also given a 12-month jail term suspended for a year (Picture: HNP)\n\nJudge Daly said: \u2018This is a group incident on a single young man who was totally unable to protect himself.\n\n\u2018He was dragged from a car, kicked and punched and suffered significant injury \u2013 bruising, damage to his teeth, needed to be on crutches for a week.\n\nMuseum staff set to stage fresh strike in long-running pay dispute\n\n\u2018For some reason, this young man was deliberately targeted. Perhaps because he came from Thame and you four came from Watlington and there had been bad blood between the two factions.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurning to Clifton he said: \u2018You accepted being significantly involved in violence, you played a leading role in what went on. You have not accepted that you have any issues with drinking. Drink, in my view, played a significant part.\n\n\u2018Drinking Coca Cola and Amaretto? I\u2019m surprised you were not sick!\u2019\n\nSe Smith was given an eight-month prison sentence suspended for 12 months (Picture: HNP)\n\nClifton, Campbell and Clifford were given 12-month prison terms suspended for a year.\n\nSmith was jailed for eight months, suspended for a year.\n\nThey were all given community service and ordered to pay a total of \u00a33,000 in court costs and compensation.\n\nJudge Daly concluded: \u2018You better mend your ways. It has been 18 months since this has happened. It would appear that each of you stands to have a good chance at rehabilitation.\n\n\u2018This has been your last chance. Appear before me again and you know exactly where you\u2019re going.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
