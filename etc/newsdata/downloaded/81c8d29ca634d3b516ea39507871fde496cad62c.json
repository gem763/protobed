Here's when to reset your clock (and which way to move it.)\n\nWhen does Australian Daylight Saving Time start?\n\nAustralian Daylight Saving Time officially starts at 2am on 6 October AEST. For those who forget how this works, you need to move your clock forward an hour. Unfortunately, this means we all miss out on an hour of sleep. (But hey, at least it's the weekend.)\n\nIf you have trouble remembering which way to set your clock, commit the following saying to memory:\n\n\"You 'Spring' forward, then you 'Fall' back.\"\n\nIn other words, you move the clock forward one hour in the Spring and move it back one hour during the \"Fall\" (which is what yanks call Autumn.) We realise it's technically possible to spring backwards and fall forwards too, but let's not overthink things, okay?\n\nAll of your connected devices should reset their clocks automatically, but it's worth double checking - especially if you have an international trip scheduled.
