Jean-Marie Leclair (1697-1764) is known for his opera Scylla et Glaucus and for his mysteriously violent death in a seedy quarter of Paris. His great skill was as a player and composer for the violin, bringing together the Italian and French styles, the virtuosity of Vivaldi and the elegance of Rameau, in a dazzling set of concertos. Leila Schayegh and the small baroque ensemble La Cetra have revived four of them from his Op 7 and Op 10 Concertos for Violin (Glossa), with delicate, precise colours and shimmering, playful textures. Every detail is considered and explained in the booklet, from the choice of French pitch to the type of bow hair used. Absorbing and brilliant.\n\n\u2022 From the previous century of French music, equally thorough in its research and thinking, comes keyboardist Rinaldo Alessandrini\u2019s Louis Couperin: [Suites] (Naive). The careful square brackets indicate that Couperin did not himself gather these pieces into the collected suites or ordres that would become familiar from his nephew Fran\u00e7ois Couperin. Alessandrini has shaped them into three satisfying sequences of dance movements, each beginning with Louis\u2019s trademark, an unmeasured prelude notated without rhythm. The dark colours and resonant harpsichord sound are alluring, echoing Saint-\u00c9vremond\u2019s contemporary treatise: \u201cPassion must be fully displayed, but never exaggerated.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The capacity of old music to stimulate contemporary thoughts and reflections was highlighted in the BBC Prom by the Dunedin Consort (BBC Sounds). It\u2019s good to hear period-style instruments being used in the creation of new music. Bach\u2019s peerless Four Orchestral Suites were juxtaposed with four new works which complemented them, by Nico Muhly, Stuart MacRae, Ailie Robertson and Stevie Wishart. All are intriguing: I especially liked Robertson\u2019s atmospheric Chaconne, leading to the elegance of Bach\u2019s Suite No 2, unusually played with three united unison flutes instead of one soloist.", "description": "Old meets new in compelling discs from Leila Schayegh and Rinaldo Alessandrini", "authors": ["Nicholas Kenyon"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ec5ae8683b125bbad5316f43695a33d6b7e32f2/0_377_800_480/master/800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=833a929e619c68132e43c882581cc3b9", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
