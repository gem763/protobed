A few years ago, it wouldn\u2019t even come up, it would just be run of the mill.\n\nMerson also heaped praise on Man Utd forward Anthony Martial (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Liverpool don\u2019t win at Old Trafford and they go and win the other two games \u2013 that\u2019s what is expected, but this is where they are at the moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018All it is with Man Utd is a bit of consistency and confidence. You only have to win three on the trot and before you know it, you\u2019re back in the top-four race and that\u2019s what they\u2019re in.\u2019\n\nMerson also heaped praise on returning Manchester United forward Anthony Martial, who was on target in the 3-1 win over Norwich on Sunday.\n\n\u2018Martial is a top player, he\u2019s better than a lot of the players they\u2019ve got,\u2019 Merson added.\n\n\u2018If you\u2019re the manager, you\u2019re always going to hope a player like him is coming back into the team. On his day, he can rip anybody apart.\n\n\u2018With Marcus Rashford also playing, they\u2019re going to hurt teams and fly up the table but it\u2019s all about consistency and they\u2019ve got to put in performances like they did against Liverpool every week.\u2019\n\nMORE: Unai Emery reveals chat with Hector Bellerin about Granit Xhaka\u2019s situation", "description": "Arsenal hero Paul Merson has given Manchester United hope of securing a top-four finish in the Premier League this season.
