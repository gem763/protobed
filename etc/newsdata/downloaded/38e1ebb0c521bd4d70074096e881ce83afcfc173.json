He is autocratic. Uncompromising. And much like Marcelo Bielsa and Sir Alex Ferguson, the two managers he respects above all others, he has long maintained that any kind of doubt or dissent \u2013 expressed by absolutely any player \u2013 is always to the detriment of the rest of the team.\n\nThat is precisely the reason why the players he fell out with in the early stages of his managerial career never seemed to stick around for very long. Think Dani Osvaldo at Southampton. Or Emmanuel Adebayor. Or Kyle Walker. If they dared to disagree with their manager, they were shown the door.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Christian Eriksen, Danny Rose, Serge Aurier and Victor Wanyama were all determined to force moves away this summer. All failed. And so, after some time on the naughty step while the club waited for the tardy European transfer window to finally close, players who were previously at loggerheads with Pochettino have been reintegrated into the first-team squad.\n\nAnd Tottenham are all the better for it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In fact, this is the first time those four defenders \u2013 widely regarded as the club\u2019s best \u2013 have started together in a back four.\n\nRose has drifted in and out of Pochettino\u2019s preferred starting XI and was made available for transfer this summer. Toby Alderweireld was dropped upon returning from a hamstring injury last season, having stalled on agreeing to a contract extension. And Jan Vertonghen was left on the bench for the first three matches of the current campaign, over a behind-closed-doors tactical disagreement.\n\nMeanwhile Aurier, signed from Paris Saint-Germain for \u00a323m back in 2017, had not started for Spurs since February. A series of erratic displays soon after joining the club saw him relegated to a role as Kieran Trippier\u2019s understudy. And after Trippier\u2019s recent departure to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Pochettino insisted to chairman Daniel Levy that he could make do with youngster Kyle Walker-Peters and Juan Foyth.\n\n\u201cI'd simply decided to leave [this summer], which was normal for me,\u201d Aurier commented this week. \u201cMany things were taken into consideration. In the end, I wasn't able to leave.\u201d\n\nYet injuries to both Walker-Peters and Foyth forced Pochettino\u2019s hand. Despite his outburst, Aurier was finally reinstated to the club's first-team for the visit of Palace. And he was superb.\n\nAfter a sumptuous long ball from Alderweireld to Son Heung-min had given Spurs the lead, Aurier helped double his team\u2019s advantage when his rapid delivery across the box was inadvertently deflected in by Palace defender Patrick van Aanholt. He then created the third, receiving the ball out wide and floating an inch-perfect ball over the Palace defence for Son to smash home.\n\nFurther forward, Eriksen \u2013 another to have started this season on the substitutes bench as speculation clouded his future \u2013 scurried and probed, drifting with ease in between Palace\u2019s defensive lines and repeatedly playing the likes of Son and Harry Kane into possession. He was characteristically superb and will be even more integral than usual in the weeks ahead after summer signing Giovani Lo Celso was injured while on international duty.\n\nPochettino has already been made to rue his stubborn streak this season. Against Aston Villa Spurs cried out for the craft of Eriksen. Against Newcastle they missed the experience and organisation offered by Vertonghen. And last time out, in the north London derby against Arsenal, they sorely lacked a specialised right-back, as a hapless Davinson S\u00e1nchez was torn to shreds in an unfamiliar position.\n\nTottenham are expected to challenge for every single tournament they enter this season. They do not have a huge squad. That means that Pochettino has to utilise every single member of his squad. He surely cannot afford to persist with his controversial strategy of freezing out first-teamers \u2013 but today\u2019s victory suggested that the cloud that has recently been hanging over the club may now be lifting.\n\nFour other things we learned", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino has been forced to break the habit of a lifetime this season.", "authors": ["Luke Brown"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/14/17/serge-aurier-spurs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
