State spending remains about $7 billion below its 2008 level, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The Great Recession was unique in many ways, but its impact on colleges was not. For decades, states have ratcheted down college funding in bad times, without replacing it when the economy comes back.\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidates\u2019 enthusiasm to partner with states on college affordability is welcome. But when the next recession strikes \u2014 and it could at any time in the coming years \u2014 states may not be able to hold up their end of the bargain .\n\nSo here\u2019s what Congress, in these relatively good economic times, could start and a new presidential administration in 2021 could build upon: Provide matching grants to states that invest more in their colleges, encouraging them to sustain their existing funding for colleges and to restore it to past levels.\n\nIn addition to this base of financial support, Congress should give extra help to states that invest in community colleges, regional public universities and historically black colleges. These are the schools that generally receive less state funding, serve larger numbers of low-income students and students of color and that are at the greatest risk of experiencing a huge wave of dropouts.\n\nWhen a state hits a rough patch, measured by a rising unemployment rate, the federal matching rate would automatically increase. The idea is similar to unemployment insurance, which automatically extends benefits for unemployed workers when the job market is weak. In 2009, Congress provided education funding as part of the stimulus, which blunted budget cuts, but relying on legislation to help states will most likely mean that help will arrive too late.\n\nThese funds would then cushion students from another run-up in tuition costs and the resulting student debt. The funds would have an extra benefit: reducing the depth and severity of the recession itself. As we saw in the Great Recession, private household debt and state budget cuts both reverberated throughout the economy, exacerbating wage cuts and job losses. Automatic help for people who need it most can both help families make ends meet and speed economic recovery, just as unemployment insurance does.\n\nIt is welcome news that college affordability is at the center of the 2020 presidential campaign and that the candidates recognize the need for a new partnership with states. But these plans are designed for the good times. Without a contingency plan for the looming mix of recession, debt increases and state budget cuts, we can\u2019t solve the student debt crisis. The prudent move, for students and families, is for Congress to take out insurance now.\n\nJames Kvaal, president of the Institute for College Access & Success, was the deputy domestic policy adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
