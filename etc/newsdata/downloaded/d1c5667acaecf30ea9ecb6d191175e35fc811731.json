'Often it's hard to get a grip on, and it's not easy to speak those lines. But she's excited to do this one.'\n\nChastain, who studied drama at the Juilliard School in New York, broke through ten years ago with a string of hit movies that came in quick succession.\n\nThey included The Debt, The Tree Of Life, The Help, Coriolanus and Zero Dark Thirty.\n\nChastain will play Nora Helmer, one of Henrik Ibsen's most famous heroines, in A Doll's House at the Playhouse Theatre\n\nHer last appearance on stage was on Broadway in The Heiress seven years ago.\n\nChastain met Lloyd through her friendship with James McAvoy, which began when both were filming The Disappearance Of Eleanor Rigby. She later watched him in Lloyd's production of The Ruling Class.\n\n'We began talking seriously a few years later about what we wanted to do in London,' Chastain told me two years ago.\n\nShe and I have chatted several times about the challenges of relocating from the U.S. with her family \u2014 husband Gian Passi de Preposulo and their baby daughter \u2014 for three months.\n\nBut she is less daunted by the prospect now after shooting the spy thriller 355 in London.\n\nChastain, who studied drama at the Juilliard School in New York, broke through ten years ago with a string of hit movies that came in quick succession\n\nOne of the films she will shoot before A Doll's House begins performances on June 10 (it will run until September 5) is The Eyes Of Tammy Faye, which will feature her singing gospel.\n\nThe first play in the Jamie Lloyd Company's inaugural season at the Playhouse will be Cyrano De Bergerac, starring McAvoy, which starts previews on November 27. The middle production in the season's line-up is still being negotiated.\n\nLloyd said Chastain 'is up for taking risks'. You get more interesting performances when an actor isn't in their comfort zone,' he said. 'She's excited to see what this might be.'\n\nTickets for A Doll's House will go on sale in January; 15,000 for the full, three-play season at the Playhouse will be free for first-time theatre-goers from schools and community centres.\n\nBeneficiaries will get help with travel costs.

Her brother, Richard, played her mother in that show.\n\nBea has just returned from playing the main part in the musical Becoming Nancy, directed by Jerry Mitchell in Atlanta, Georgia.

'There's so much division in the world now,' she said.\n\nThe show deals with Tracy's efforts to make the local TV dance show more racially integrated. 'We couldn't dance together. Do you want to go back to that?!'
