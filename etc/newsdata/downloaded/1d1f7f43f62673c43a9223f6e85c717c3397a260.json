It was then that we began to hear about \u201cthreads\u201d and \u201cbackground tasks.\u201d It all seemed, and indeed was, pretty nifty.\n\nMost of us, I believe, tend to ignore or forget about background tasks. We see the foreground process unfolding before us and focus on that. But in life as in computers, switching between is often but the work of a moment. The establishment news networks\u2014those working against Donald Trump\u2014would have us believe that the big story of the century is the impeachment of, or at least the impeachment inquiry directed at, Donald Trump.\n\nBut while Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) are busy pushing that narrative, there is a vibrant background task that is just now being promoted to foreground status. If we had the equivalent of a political \u201cactivity monitor\u201d to assess what was happening, we would see that the process called \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d is shedding resources and prominence as it heads toward idle status.\n\nThe process called \u201cQuis custodes custodiet?\u201d meanwhile\u2014\u201cWho will guard the guardians?\u201d\u2014is beginning to gobble up CPU resources and memory. I am not the only one to notice that Schiff and Nadler are more and more playing to suburban dinner theaters with tiny audiences while the names William Barr, John Durham, and Michael Horowitz are front-page news wherever there is news (as distinct from propaganda).\n\nThe latest flag announcing this realignment came Saturday morning, when James Clapper, Obama\u2019s director of national intelligence and now one of his spokesmen on CNN, was asked whether he was concerned that the investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia hoax (my term, not the interlocutor\u2019s) might implicate senior members of the so-called intelligence community, i.e., chaps like James Clapper.\n\nClapper\u2019s response was revealing, not to say hilarious. Remember, the question is: Are you \u201cconcerned\u201d (i.e., worried, anxious) about the investigation overseen by Attorney General Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham.\n\nClapper\u2019s multipart answer: I don\u2019t think there was any wrongdoing; I was just trying to help the country; if there was wrongdoing, it was not my fault; I was just following orders.\n\nIpse dixit: \u201cI don\u2019t think there was any wrongdoing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of us were trying to navigate a very, very difficult, politically fraught highly charged situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor my part, my main concern was the Russians, and the threat posed by the Russians to our very political fabric.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmessage\u201d he is getting from the controversy is that we should \u201cignore the Russian interference and meddling and the threat that it poses.\u201d (Read: \u201cDon\u2019t blame me,\u201d he seems to say, \u201cif the Russkie\u2019s take over.\u201d)\n\nBig takeaway: it is \u201cdisconcerting\u201d now to be \u201cinvestigated for doing our duty, what we were told to do by the president.\u201d\n\nAnd exactly what were they doing? Investigating a candidate, President-elect Trump, with the end, said Clapper, of preparing a big, comprehensive report for Congress and \u201cthe next administration.\u201d\n\nYou see that James Clapper, despite appearances to the contrary, does have a wry sense of humor. He can say with a straight face that the covert investigation aimed at destroying Donald Trump was actually an investigation intended at least in part for the incoming Trump administration.\n\nYuck, yuck, yuck. What a card!\n\nBut note that Clapper, funny though he was, was not himself laughing. I don\u2019t blame him. The spook-turned-media-lap-dog is as much in the crosshairs as anyone, except perhaps another spook-turned-media-lap-dog, former CIA director and Gus Hall voter John Brennan, who now lends his authoritative anti-Trump commentary to MSNBC.\n\nBy the way, what is it with these new escalators that transport former senior intelligence and law enforcement personnel to lucrative posts in the anti-Trump media? Is it part of their severance packages? It\u2019s not only Clapper and Brennan. The same happened to Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI. McCabe may be a trailblazer. He was the first of the gang whom federal prosecutors recommended be indicted for leaking. He won\u2019t be the last.\n\nIt\u2019s all happening so fast. Andrew McCarthy was early out of the gate in August with Ball of Collusion: The Plot to Rig an Election a destroy a Presidency. Next week, we\u2019ll see Lee Smith\u2019s The Plot Against the President: The True Story of How Congressman Devin Nunes Uncovered the Biggest Political Scandal in U.S. History roll off the press.\n\nMeanwhile, William Barr and John Durham continue their efforts to get to the bottom of this complex, deep-state effort to destroy a duly elected president of the United States. Just Friday, it was announced that Durham\u2019s investigation was not a full-fledged criminal investigation. Uh oh.\n\nRepresentatives Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) are still singing their impeachment cantata. But a huge orchestra, with plenty of brass (not to mention subpoena and prosecutorial power) has assembled and is tuning up. We\u2019re told that Michael Horowitz\u2019s much-anticipated inspector general\u2019s report on the origins of the FISA warrants against American citizens, after numerous delays, will be released imminently, perhaps as soon as next week. Horowitz was quoted as saying it will be \u201cvery detailed\u201d and feature \u201climited redactions.\u201d\n\nYou can see why James Clapper objects that he was just following orders. Expect the same song from John Brennan, James Comey, the disgraced former director of the FBI, and other anti-Trump activists in the \u201cintelligence community.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-680438982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
