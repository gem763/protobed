The former Liverpool striker, now head coach of the A-League\u2019s Brisbane Roar, has been buzzing around the training pitch, running drills in a way some managers might think undignified. When the ball falls to his feet, just like it did as an 18-year-old on his debut, Fowler can still make football seem an effortless caper.\n\nIn retirement, a striker\u2019s eye for goal is about as useless as a Tuesday yard sale. Fowler knows the same raw talent that propelled his playing career won\u2019t help him as a manager. Which partly explains the reason he has spent the past decade away from the scrutiny of top-flight football; relearning the game by studying for coaching badges and honing the craft by working with academy players.\n\nMelbourne Victory under-perform as other A-League clubs lift | Richard Parkin Read more\n\n\u201cI think back on myself as a player, I was maybe pushed right in at the deep end and I did well,\u201d Fowler says. \u201cBut now as a manager I\u2019m not pushed in at the deep end and I feel comfortable, I feel competent and more than equipped.\u201d\n\nFowler spent two seasons playing in Australia at the end of his career, before he briefly took charge of Thai side Muangthong United in 2012. After Thailand he decided to pursue a patient path into management, even as his contemporaries began to find themselves in thrust into prominent roles, armed with ambition rather than experience. Fowler, 44, is two years younger than Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, now in charge at Manchester United. Frank Lampard quit playing only three years ago, and has taken the reins at Chelsea.\n\n\u201cLike any player, you want to be the best you can at whatever level you can reach,\u201d Fowler says. \u201cI was never going to start in the Premier League straight away, so for me it was a case of starting somewhere which was a good level. It has been years of hard work in terms of coaching. I knew I wanted to go through all the coaching badges and get to the level required because I wanted people to take me seriously.\n\n\u201cWhen you stop playing you want to go straight into the next chapter of your life as soon as possible. Of course I would have liked to have done it a little bit earlier but in a way I\u2019m so glad it worked out the way it did because I\u2019ve got \u2026 the Fifa pro licence. When you\u2019ve got that people think \u2018well, maybe he is a little bit serious\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhen you have been quite a good player, at times you can never win when you go into management because people maybe expect a little bit more. If you don\u2019t get things right it\u2019s always the case of \u2018I told you so\u2019.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fowler celebrates Roy O\u2019Donovan\u2019s late equaliser in Brisbane\u2019s A-League opener in Perth. Photograph: Paul Kane/Getty Images\n\nFowler\u2019s decision to make career strides in Australia, rather than the English lower leagues, certainly does not reflect a lack of ambition. It also has some distinct advantages. Brisbane shipped a record 71 goals and won just four games last season, finishing second last. Fowler has a remit for a bottom-up rebuild of the club, which was once the league\u2019s powerhouse, and he has brought in nine players from various lower league sides back at home. The scenario feels like a test of his abilities as a football league manager, but without the same in-your-face scrutiny he would experience in the football league.\n\n'An epic achievement': Robbie Fowler's coaching debut ends in shock FFA Cup win Read more\n\n\u201cSometimes you pick up your paper and you don\u2019t even read about football, which to me is really strange,\u201d Fowler says. \u201c[But] I don\u2019t think [there will be a lack of scrutiny in Australia]; I\u2019m a person that has had a relatively good career as a player so people will always have an opinion anyway.\n\n\u201cThe good thing for me coming here is that I can get my own blueprint. You saw Brisbane last year and without being disrespectful they definitely struggled. They had an ageing team who needed change and a different mentality, a different mindset. We\u2019re a new team and we want to do well. The players we\u2019ve brought in, some of them from the lower leagues of the the UK, are doing really well.\u201d\n\nFowler\u2019s first match in charge, against reigning champions Perth Glory \u2013 an away trip roughly the distance between the UK and Kazakhstan \u2013 brought back a creditable point with a side featuring nine debutants.\n\nOn the Monday before his second match in charge, having been forced to park the momentum of the result against Perth during the league\u2019s newly-introduced bye-week, Fowler looks slightly weary as he trudges off the training pitch after a morning session, but for good reason. Liverpool\u2019s late equaliser at Old Trafford went in about 3.20am. Fowler is quickly remembering what it means to be serious about football in a backward timezone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a great sleeper anyway so I actually stayed up and watched it,\u201d Fowler says. \u201cIt\u2019s what you do with football isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nIn spite of the horrendous kick-off times, Fowler says the laid-back Australian experience might help shape his management style, and also help to encourage potential managers and players to find career opportunities off the beaten track.\n\nWhen Robbie Fowler became God: 20 years on from history-making hat-trick Read more\n\n\u201cI wanted to be as successful and to do as well as what I can. For me it didn\u2019t really matter where it was. We could be a little bit of a test case, if you like, for managers or players at clubs. The lifestyle is a big thing because you don\u2019t play as many games so you can go through a season without all the aches and pains and niggles, and enjoy the fact we play one game a week.\n\n\u201cI want the players to enjoy it. The enjoyment comes with winning games right through to training sessions. We are trying to get them to enjoy the ball, to get them to love it a little bit more. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t want to be competitive. I think we will be competitive.\u201d", "description": "Brisbane Roar\u2019s coach on wanting to be taken seriously as a manager, being a \u2018test case\u2019, and staying up into the early hours to watch Liverpool on TV", "authors": ["Ben Smee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f99fc58026af1ca1d287a674cf1a665867e35ad9/0_288_5382_3231/master/5382.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b7a27e04646eabcd8ccf05cfc937fbaa", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
