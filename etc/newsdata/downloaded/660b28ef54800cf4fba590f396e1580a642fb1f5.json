She credits her success to daily crowdsourcing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on DM constantly telling people how to do their nails, but our shades are also fully vetted by our community,\u201d says Gibson Tuttle. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s a majority vote, we\u2019ll release the shade. I do what our community says.\u201d\n\nGibson Tuttle\u2019s entire career has been about making clients happy, although it began in the financial sector. The Colgate University graduate\u2019s first job was in JPMorgan\u2019s International Equity department, liaising between its traders and clients.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of hustle, a lot of taking care of clients,\u201d she remembers. \u201cIt totally fit my personality. In my opinion, if you\u2019re a client service person, you can do any client-service job. It\u2019s a mind-set. You either have that kind of mentality, or you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAfter ten years, she started to feel the entrepreneurial gene she inherited from both of her parents, although the category itself was a blank. Intrigued by the notion of talent management, she flew to the West Coast for dozens of interviews, and nearly as many blowouts at Drybar, as well as manicures and pedicures, her favorite treatments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always pedicure season in L.A., so I couldn\u2019t understand why the salons weren\u2019t more elevated,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI thought, I should do the Drybar for nails.\u201d\n\nShe took her great-grandmother and grandmother\u2019s names, respectively, and opened her first location in 2013 on Canon Drive. Pasadena and Santa Monica followed, then, in March, a collection of pale neutral polishes, along with the Poppy, a cute, squat, rubbery attachment designed to make the DIY manicure easier for the non-ambidextrous.\n\n\u201cWomen buy all these products, but only do their own nails three times a year. We thought, how do we empower them to paint their nails? That\u2019s where the idea of the Poppy came from, because when your nails are painted, you feel amazing.\u201d\n\nGibson Tuttle spoke with the Cut about her first polish obsession, her dream client, and how Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian influenced her beauty routine.\n\nWhat\u2019s your definition of beauty? Beauty is my favorite form of self-expression. It can be a tonal ombr\u00e9, my green eyeliner, a favorite hair accessory. Beauty is so much more than a product in your hand. It is what that product does to make you feel good about yourself.\n\nWhat do you think when you hear the term \u201cclean beauty\u201d? I love \u201cclean beauty\u201d conceptually but dislike that it can be confusing. There isn\u2019t really a standard or clear definition of what \u201cclean beauty\u201d means across the industry. It changes for every product category, or even every company. At Olive & June we are hyperfocused on educating our community and ourselves to make sure we are making the best choices when it comes to our products, tools, and services. We want cleaner nail products in this world to up the industry game. Consumers deserve to know the truth and not just be marketed at.\n\nWhere, if anywhere, in your beauty (or life) routine are you not quite that \u201cclean,\u201d \u201cgreen,\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d? I only drink fresh almond milk but I also get Botox. I believe in balance. I love Skittles too!\n\nWhat is the opposite of \u201cbeautiful\u201d? Judgement.\n\nWhat is your morning skin-care routine? I wash my face and use Dr. Nigma Hydrating and Plumping Serum No 1 and Control Correctives sunscreen. Always, always sunscreen. And as I learned from Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, include your neck and chest, too!\n\nWhat\u2019s the last beauty product you use every night? Olive & June Cuticle Serum. It\u2019s non-greasy (it won\u2019t get on your sheets!) and hydrates the skin around your nails as well as your cuticles. Your mani will look like you just got it done.\n\nWhat aspect of your beauty routine tends to be neglected? I often use facial wipes (Ursa Major are my fave) instead of washing my face. I get lazy after a long day.\n\nWhat, if anything, is usually on your lips? Anything and everything Kosas or Sara Happ.\n\nWhat shade, if any, is usually on your toes and/or hands? I\u2019m currently obsessed with tonal ombr\u00e9 manis and have Olive & June polish in SE, HD, GH, and BI across my nails. Loving CDJ on my toes all year round. That shade goes with everything.\n\nWhat makeup item would you never skip? Eyeliner! I recently met Violette (hello, makeup goals) and she had the most gorgeous, colorful eyeliner, which inspired me to get more playful with color.\n\nBath or shower? Bath, with Goop Martini Bath Salts.\n\nDream client you have yet to get at Olive & June? Michelle Obama.\n\nWhat was your first beauty-product obsession? Chanel nail polish in Vamp. My friend wore it, but my father never let me wear nail polish. I used to sneak it when he was away on work trips.\n\nSunglasses of choice: Gentle Monster sunglasses every single day. They were the best non-work-related find on my work trips to our manufacturing partner in Seoul.\n\nHow do you like your living room? Whatever Wall for Apricots designs makes me feel at home.\n\nWhat do you splurge on? Rachel Comey and sneakers.\n\nWhat do you scrimp on? Gas.\n\nWhat are the first three things you do when you get home from work? Hug my little one, change into a sweatsuit, and take off my makeup.\n\nWhat is your own personal definition of misery? Picking the wrong mani color.\n\nWhat is your own personal definition of glee? Picking a mani color for someone that they love.\n\nAre you a knee-jerk reactor to bad news (like an annoying email), or can you step back and take a breath? I used to react but have learned to take a breath and think it through. It\u2019s been a great skill to hone because almost every problem can be solved.\n\nWhat would the name of your autobiography be? Olive Me.\n\nWho would star as you in the film adaptation? My friends would all say Scarlett Johannssen or Emily Blunt.\n\nFavorite smell? Whatever Oribe hair products are scented with.\n\nWhat do you think Pantone\u2019s color of 2020 should be, and why? A light teal-y green to match my eyeliner.\n\nWhat are you usually sipping from during the day? Either Starbucks Guava White Iced Tea or a Good Mylk Matcha Latte.\n\nWhat calms you down? Hanging with my besties or some reality TV.\n\nComfort food: Auntie Barbara\u2019s Cheese Puffs.\n\nWhat food would you never eat? Beets.\n\nWhat do you foresee as the top beauty trends for 2020? Manis will continue to be more fun \u2014 art is coming back, even in New York! More skin treatments versus topicals, as women want to see results immediately. More playful makeup that feels halfway between every day and runway.\n\nWhat are the big nail trends you\u2019re seeing right now? People are also saying creamy greens are big for fall, but for right this minute, different takes on the French mani (like thicker or at an angle) and what we call the Tonal Ombre (a.k.a., the Skittles mani). We did the Cotton Candy mani, which is four different shades of pink and white. It\u2019s been so popular, next week we\u2019re actually launching ombr\u00e9 Nail Art kits based on the trend.\n\nWhat product in your domain is misunderstood and should be a best seller? Our K.I.T. KIT is incredible. There\u2019s a misconception out there that regular salon manis are all you need, but making your nails part of your beauty routine is really where you\u2019ll see the big difference. The K.I.T Kit has everything it takes to maintain a fresh mani in between paint jobs, including daily cuticle serum and a top-coat touch-up every few days. Chipping is no one\u2019s friend.\n\nIf you won the Power Ball tomorrow, what are the first five things you would do? (After, of course, donating the majority of it to your top charities \u2026) After launching a fund for all of the kids of our employees to go to the college of their choice or fund their own businesses, I would: Take a long vacation with my family, bribe my brother and his wife to move their family to L.A., give everyone at Olive & June a raise, hire a chef so that I would actually eat healthy (RIP Skittles), and buy an Anita Ko diamond tennis bracelet.\n\nNot to get too philosophical, but \u2026 what do you want? I want to wake up in a world where self-care isn\u2019t a buzzword, it\u2019s the norm. My dream is that people find the things that make them feel like their best selves and make it a regular part of their lives. If Olive & June can be a part of that, then mission accomplished.", "description": "For the Cut\u2019s column The Beauty of it All, Jane Larkworthy talks to Olive & June founder Sarah Gibson Tuttle about creating nail polish shades based on followers\u2019 votes, the importance of at-home nail care and her favorite beauty products", "authors": ["Jane Larkworthy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/12/12-boia-sarah-gibson-tuttle.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
