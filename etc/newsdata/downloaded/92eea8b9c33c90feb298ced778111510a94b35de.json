A lot of people said Lawler wasn\u2019t the same; I don\u2019t feel like that,\u201d Till said. \u201cI feel like Colby was just too much for Lawler, so when you break a fight down \u2026 because people hate Colby so much and take what he says so personal, they just want (Kamaru) Usman to win. They\u2019re not looking at Colby. Colby is actually a terrific fighter. Forget all the (expletive) he says, because he\u2019s just an idiot. He\u2019s actually a terrific fighter.\u201d\n\nCovington is set to challenge welterweight champion Usman in the main event of UFC 245, and while Till sees a lot of similarities in their games, he believes Usman has the slight advantage.\n\n\u201cI think if you put them both together, they\u2019re the same fighter,\u201d Till said. \u201cI think Usman has everything that Colby has, just a bit better. I think he\u2019s got more power. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s got the bigger gas tank. I know that Colby has an unbelievable gas tank, so I think Usman just edges it.\u201d\n\nTill, who will be making the move up to middleweight against Kelvin Gastelum next month at UFC 244, has not ruled out a move back down to 170 pounds in the future. While he\u2019s never had any real altercations with Covington, he\u2019s had his fair share of trash talk with Usman in the past. But a potential fight likely won\u2019t happen in the near future, considering that Usman is the welterweight champ and Till is pursuing 185.\n\n\u201cNot really. Me and him, we had a little bit of chatter but never really crossed paths,\u201d Till said of Covington. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s on a totally different path. I feel like that fight with Usman was always a fight I wanted, as much as a lot of people tried to avoid him. That was a fight I wanted to get and obviously with him being the champ now.\u201d", "description": "Darren Till compliments Colby Covington for his combat skills, despite the fact that he's \"just an idiot.\"", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "Blue Corner", "Nolan King"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/darren-till-ufc-copenhagen.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
