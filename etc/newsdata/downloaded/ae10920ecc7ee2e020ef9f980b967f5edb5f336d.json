The oil output disruption is being described by energy experts as the largest-ever.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian head of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries appeared to urge calm as the markets wrestled with the severity and potential length of disruption of the Saudi Aramco Abqaiq plant and its Khurais oil field. The Wall Street Journal, citing Saudi officials, have said a third of output would be restored on Monday, but a return to full production may take weeks, experts have said.\n\nOPEC and Russia are holding off on pumping more oil to fill gaps in global supplies, the Journal also reported, citing officials. Saudi Arabia held calls with cartel members and other oil-producing allies over the weekend and told producers they wouldn\u2019t need to respond with a boost to output, the report said.\n\nRead: Why the Saudi oil attack is a \u2018big deal\u2019 that could be a \u2018game changer\u2019 in stock markets and crude prices\n\nCheck out: Saudi oil sites shut production after hit by Yemen\u2019s Houthi drones\n\n\u201cWhat we see in markets are the initial reaction from the community but going forward I think the updates from Saudi Arabia,\u201d will calm the market, Barkindo told Bloomberg.\n\nBarkindo also said it was \u201cpremature to contemplate what will be done\u201d in terms of increasing capacity from members of OPEC+, a group of major oil producers that also includes Russia.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery CLV19, +10.12% the U.S. benchmark contract, was up 10.1%, or $5.54, at $60.39 a barrel on Monday. A gain of that magnitude, if prices hold through Monday\u2019s settlement, would represent the largest daily advance for the most-active contract since February 2016, according to FactSet data.\n\nNovember Brent crude BRNX19, +10.59% jumped $6.42, or 10.6%, to trade at $66.62 a barrel, which would also mark the sharpest daily rise for the international benchmark grade since February 2016.\n\nRead: Oil could rally above $75 a barrel if outage lasts more than six weeks, says Goldman", "description": "The oil cartel\u2019s chief told Bloomberg that OPEC has learned an important lesson from the attacks that knocked offline some 5.7 million barrels a day of oil,...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HD744_barkin_ZG_20190211145340.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
