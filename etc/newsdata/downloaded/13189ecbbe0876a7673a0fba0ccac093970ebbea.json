This Chinese Bomber Could Sink Them.", "language": "en", "text": "The Chinese air force has modified a small number of H-6 bombers apparently to carry a very large new anti-ship missile.\n\nThe new munition, possibly a variant of the DF-21D ballistic anti-ship missile, could pose a serious danger to U.S. Navy vessels operating in the western Pacific. Aircraft carriers, in particular, could be at risk.\n\nThe new H-6N variant of the venerable Chinese bomber -- itself a clone of the Soviet Tu-16 -- first appeared over Beijing during preparations for celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Military parades and fly-overs are scheduled for Oct. 1, 2019.\n\nThe H-6Ns feature an under-fuselage recess that could accommodate a single, very large missile. The DF-21D is more than 30 feet long and weighs around 32,000 pounds. It can travel as far as 1,300 miles with a 1,200-pound warhead.\n\n\u201cExperts say that there at least four of these aircraft presently assigned to a People's Liberation Army Air Force bomber brigade in China's Central Theater Command region,\u201d Joseph Trevithick wrote at The War Zone.\n\nReports about the H-6N and its ballistic-missile launching mission first began to emerge in 2017. Xi'an Aircraft International Corporation's H-6, a derivative of the Soviet-era Tu-16 Badger, has been the centerpiece of China's bomber force since the 1970s. In 2009, the H-6K variant, a significant redesign from the original aircraft optimized as a carrier for long-range anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles, entered service. The H-6N is a further outgrowth of this earlier missile carrier version. The most notable change between the N and K is the complete elimination of the bomb bay on the N and the addition of semi-recessed area with a hard point for a large missile. This is similar in some general respects to the ability of Russia's Tu-22M Backfire bombers can carry a single Kh-22 or Kh-32 anti-ship cruise missile in a semi-recessed mount under its central fuselage. There are no pictures from the parade preparations that show the H-6Ns carrying a payload and some of them appear to have a plug installed that gives the fuselage its normal profile when a missile is not loaded. So, it remains unclear what type of weapon, or weapons, the Chinese intend to employ on these aircraft.\n\nBut Trevithick thinks it\u2019s the DF-21D. \u201cPrevious reports have indicated that an air-launched derivative of the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile, reportedly called the CH-AS-X-13, will be the primary weapon for the H-6N.\u201d\n\nBesides arming its bombers with a possible new missile, Beijing has been making efforts to diversify and harden its anti-ship arsenal.\n\nThe People's Liberation Army Rocket Force positioned at least a dozen transporter-erector-launcher vehicles for the DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missile at a previously undisclosed training range near Alxa in China's Inner Mongolia region, Jane's reported after reviewing DigitalGlobe satellite imagery dated Jan. 9, 2019.\n\nThe deployment reportedly was a response to the appearance of a U.S. Navy warship near the Paracel Islands on Jan. 7, 2019. The destroyer USS McCampbell sailed near the island group as part of a \"freedom-of-navigation operation,\" or FONOP.\n\nChina, Vietnam and Taiwan all claim the Paracels, which lie around 650 miles from China's Hainan Island. In recent years China has dredged several reefs in the Paracels and built military outposts on them.\n\nThe U.S. Navy conducts FONOPs in order to assert its legal right to sail through international waters regardless of which country claims nearby territory. China's state-run Global Times new outlet described McCampbell's appearance near the Paracels as \"trespass.\"\n\n\"McCampbell sailed within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands to challenge excessive maritime claims and preserve access to the waterways as governed by international law,\u201d Lt. Rachel McMarr, a U.S. Pacific Fleet spokesperson, told the news website of the U.S. Naval Institute.\n\nThe DF-26 is China's most powerful anti-ship missile. It's 46 feet tall and weighs 44,000 pounds. \"The DF-26 comes with a 'modular design,' meaning that the launch vehicle can accommodate two types of nuclear warheads and several types of conventional warheads,\" the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. reported.", "description": "The Chinese air force has modified a small number of H-6 bombers apparently to carry a very large new anti-ship missile.
