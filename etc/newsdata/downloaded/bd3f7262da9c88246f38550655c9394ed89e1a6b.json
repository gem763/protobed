He\u2019s pulling out all the stops to make it a success, too.\n\nBruce certainly reaches for the skies on a film made with long-term collaborator Thom Zimny. The project frames the singer in an intimate setting, in stark contrast with his reputation as a stadium rock god\n\nFamously averse to hyperbole \u2014 he once tore down his own publicity posters outside Hammersmith Odeon \u2014 he has been avidly promoting this latest venture.\n\nThe past week saw him appear on The Graham Norton Show and attend two advance screenings in London.\n\nAnd, as he told cinemagoers, his move to the big screen is part of the stock-taking that comes with turning 70, as he did last month.\n\nIt\u2019s a process that has also included an autobiography and last year\u2019s Broadway residency.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m getting to that age where you\u2019re summing up a lot of what you\u2019ve learned,\u2019 he said during a live Q&A.\n\nFamously averse to hyperbole \u2014 he once tore down his own publicity posters outside Hammersmith Odeon \u2014 he has been avidly promoting this latest venture\n\n\u2018Writing a book was the first chapter. The play came out of the book and this [the film] came out of the play. I\u2019ve had a good run over the past five years as far as feeling inspired goes. I\u2019ve done things I\u2019ve never done before. I feel lucky for that . . . because you never know.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a man of many talents,\u2019 he went on. \u2018I write books and Broadway plays. Now I\u2019m making movies. I\u2019m going to try being an astronaut next,\u2019 he joked. At least I think he was joking.\n\nBruce certainly reaches for the skies on a film made with long-term collaborator Thom Zimny. The project frames the singer in an intimate setting, in stark contrast with his reputation as a stadium rock god.\n\nBacked by a band and full orchestra, and performing in a converted barn in the grounds of his New Jersey home, he sings the original album tracks in chronological order, adding a commanding cover of Glen Campbell\u2019s Rhinestone Cowboy to finish \u2014 \u2018a tip of the hat to a lot of my inspiration\u2019.\n\nThe film isn\u2019t a straight performance picture, with the live takes interspersed with Super 8 footage from Bruce\u2019s childhood and a playful clip from his honeymoon.\n\nThe album\u2019s character-driven story-songs are inspired largely by the American West, so we are shown lots of Breaking Bad- style desert scenes, with Bruce looking moody behind the wheel of his pick-up truck.\n\nThe past week saw him appear on The Graham Norton Show (above) and attend two advance screenings in London\n\nHis scripted voiceover gives Western Stars a loose narrative thread and the film opens with an explanation of how his songwriting was inspired by the two contrasting sides of the American character.\n\n\u2018One is transient, restless, solitary,\u2019 he says. \u2018The other is collective and communal in its search for family, deep roots and a home for the heart to reside.\u2019\n\nThe original album \u2014 a lush affair influenced by songwriters such as Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb \u2014 was a skilful homage. The cinematic update, boosted by the spontaneity of live performance and the acoustic properties of Bruce\u2019s cavernous barn, feels like a proper Springsteen record.\n\nThe presence of his wife Patti Scialfa helps.\n\nSpringsteen admits it was \u2018a big mistake\u2019 not to utilise Patti on the original album and her fresh vocal arrangements add a new dimension to Sundown and Stones, the latter an astonishing performance featuring the husband and wife duo together on the microphone.\n\nElsewhere, Tucson Train is looser and richer while The Wayfarer is lifted by improvised piano.\n\nChasin\u2019 Wild Horses is introduced with a telling aside from a singer once born to run.\n\nAs he says: \u2018You can run away for a while, but you can\u2019t run away forever,\u2019 reiterating the emotional punch packed by this engaging director\u2019s cut.\n\nSpringsteen turned Western Stars into a film because he wanted to promote it, but didn\u2019t want to go on the road with an orchestra. \u2018It\u2019s an unusual piece of music,\u2019 he admits. And it is.\n\nHe plans to use his regular group, The E Street Band, for his next album and tour.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve got to go back to the day job,\u2019 he says. \u2018You have to pay the bills.\u2019\n\nThe Western Stars soundtrack album is out next week. The film is on general release from October 28.\n\nNew releases\n\nElbow: Giants Of All Sizes (Polydor)\n\nFoals: Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part Two (Transgressive)\n\nDJ Spoony: Garage Classical (Since \u201993)\n\nElbow: Giants Of All Sizes (Polydor)\n\nElbow have replaced their bruised but benevolent charm with a darker mood that reflects loss \u2014 singer Guy Garvey\u2019s father died while it was being made \u2014 and a wider sense of unease.\n\nThe change is at the expense of their usual melodic uplift, though this resurfaces on Weightless, about Garvey\u2019s dad; and On Deronda Road, which extols the joys of a bus ride with your child.\n\nRating:\n\nFoals: Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part Two (Transgressive)\n\nInstalment two of the Oxford quartet\u2019s latest album frames the band\u2019s rockier side, but feels untidy and overbearing.\n\nIts scattergun approach sees cinematic instrumentals rub shoulders with chaotic stomps like The Runner and the bluesy Like Lightning.\n\nOnly Dreaming Of harks back to the funkier Foals of old. Part One gained a well-merited Mercury nod, but this is an anticlimax.\n\nRating:\n\nDJ Spoony: Garage Classical (Since \u201993)\n\nThe glitchy electronics of garage music lend themselves well to the orchestral treatment.\n\nWorking with radio presenter Spoony, conductor Katie Chatburn superbly revamps the hits Gotta Get Thru This, Fill Me In and 21 Seconds.\n\nLily Allen supplies a lovely vocal on Sweet Like Chocolate and Emeli Sande sings Crazy Love.\n\nRating:\n\nAT", "description": "ADRIAN THRILLS: Bruce Springsteen has turned new album Western Stars into a full-length film with its own soundtrack.
