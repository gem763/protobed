And of course Sally Spectra with her wily ways stealing designs from Forrester Creations. And seriously, how many times can people marry each other?\n\nIn honour of the years of viewing pleasure, we countdown five of our favourite storylines.\n\n5. SISTERLY LOVE\n\nStephanie (Susan Flannery) has a long complicated history with her family. After being abused as a child she cut all ties with her family until she was encouraged by her therapist Taylor (Hunter Tylo) to confront her family and get closure.\n\nHer sister Pam (Alley Mills) ended up living in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter Stephanie\u2019s marriage with Eric (John McCook) failed, again, her sister Pam actively worked to destroy Eric\u2019s newfound relationship with Donna (Jennifer Gareis).\n\nShe pulled a number of vicious pranks on her like trapping her in a tanning bed and turning her hair and teeth green.\n\nBut the worst thing she did was lure her to a cabin in the woods, tie her to a chair and pour honey over her to entice a wild grizzly bear to attack her.\n\n4. TAYLOR HAYES COMES BACK FROM THE DEAD TWICE\n\nDr Taylor Hayes first met Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss) when he and his then wife Caroline (Joanna Johnson) went for counselling after she was diagnosed with leukemia.\n\nAfter Caroline's death Ridge fell in love with Taylor and after some ups and downs in their relationship thanks to Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) the pair eventually tied the knot for the first time in 1992.\n\nTaylor was presumed dead after a plane crash in 1994 but she survived - suffering from amnesia and living in Morocco as Princess Laila.\n\nAs she started remembering who she is, the man who rescued her Prince Omar Rashid (Kabir Bedi) became her captor and forced her to marry him.\n\nIn true soapie style Taylor managed to escape and pretended to be a nurse taking care of Ridge who was temporarily blind. She eventually revealed her true self to the family.\n\nBut wait, the story doesn\u2019t end there.\n\nIn 2002 Taylor was shot by Sheila (Kimberlin Brown) and underwent surgery but did not survive and died in Ridge's arms.\n\nBut it turned out, once again, she was abducted by Prince Omar and kept alive in a coma until she fully healed. She miraculously made her way back to her family, again.\n\n3. WHOSE BABY IS IT?\n\nOne of the long running storylines of the soapie is the rivalry between Taylor and Brooke - for years the pair fought over Ridge.\n\nAfter surviving death a second time, Taylor found love with Nick (Jack Wagner). They conceived a child, Jack through in vitro fertilisation.\n\nBut there was a mix up at the lab and it turned out that Brooke's eggs were used instead, which meant that Jack was biologically Brooke's son.\n\nAfter discovering that Jack wasn't hers Taylor went on a downward spiral and battled with alcohol addiction and mental health issues. A court battle followed and Taylor was eventually granted joint custody of Jack but in the end she gave him to Brooke.\n\n2. RIDGE, I AM YOUR FATHER\n\nRidge Forrester\u2019s true paternity will go down as one of the biggest shockers in the history of the show.\n\nIn 2001 Stephanie's childhood friend and first love Massimo Marone (Joseph Mascolo) conveniently came back into her life to win her back. Ridge was in an accident and needed a blood transfusion.\n\nWhen Ridge and Eric's blood types didn't match it was revealed that Massimo was his father.\n\n1. 14, 15 ... WHO'S COUNTING ANYWAY\n\nTechnically this is not a storyline but no list would be complete without mentioning Brooke Logan's many trips down the aisle.\n\nBrooke will go down as one of the soapie world\u2019s characters who was married to a father and both his sons. No judgies.\n\nShe is currently married to Ridge now played by Thorsten Kaye for the eighth time.\n\nBrooke has also been married to Eric, twice; Grant Chambers, Thorne Forrester, Whipple Jones, Nick Marone and Bill Spencer, Jr.\n\nSPECIAL MENTION\n\nSouth African actress Terry Pheto played heart surgoen Dr Malaika Maponya, a recurring character on the show from 2011 - 2013.\n\n(Sources: www.cbs.soapsindepth, soapcentral.com, theboldandthebeautiful.fandom.com)\n\nREAD NEXT: Then and now \u2013 we catch up with The Bold and the Beautiful\u2019s brightest stars", "description": "In honour of the years of viewing pleasure The Bold and the Beautiful provided we countdown five of our favourite storylines.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8582/c400607d45ae437eb1bc3e5f289c74c7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-05"}
