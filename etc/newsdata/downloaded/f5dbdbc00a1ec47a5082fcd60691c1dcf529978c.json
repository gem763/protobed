We\u2019ll take a comprehensive look across the DFS industry to uncover these core recommendations, factoring respective salaries into the analysis.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWe will be looking at the four-game Monday slate beginning at 1:05 ET.\n\nPITCHER\n\nZack Greinke - Houston (at Tampa Bay)\n\nMax Scherzer at home is a strong candidate as well, but Greinke finds himself in a better matchup with a cheaper salary. The Houston #3 starter was fantastic in his last start of the regular season, tossing 8.1 scoreless innings with two hits and nine strikeouts at Seattle. He checks in as a solid -140 road favorite with a chance to help the Astros advance to the ALCS.\n\nAlso Consider: Max Scherzer\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nHowie Kendrick - Washington (vs. LA Dodgers)\n\nI\u2019m liking Kendrick as a bargain choice with the platoon advantage over Dodgers\u2019 left-handed pitcher Rich Hill. Kendrick has been a sparkplug for the Nationals throughout most of this season, hitting .344 in 334 at-bats. He should hold a premium lineup spot this evening, which is enough to consider him an accommodating value play or utility filler.\n\nAlso Consider: Freddie Freeman\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nLuis Arraez - Minnesota (vs. New York Yankees)\n\nStory continues\n\nKendrick and Arraez represent two of the better value picks on this slate. By locking in both infielders, you should have enough salary to comfortably roster an ace pitcher with high-upside outfielders. Arraez has been playing through an ankle injury, but the rookie continues to produce with three doubles in the first two games of this series. He consistently puts the ball in play, and I\u2019m willing to take a chance on him to make something happen again tonight.\n\nAlso Consider: Ozzie Albies\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nTommy Edman - St. Louis (vs. Atlanta)\n\nThe Cardinals were able to frustrate Atlanta LHP Dallas Keuchel in Game 1, as the southpaw lasted 4.2 innings with five hits, one earned run, and no strikeouts. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he labored through this St. Louis lineup again, and Edman should hold a premium lineup spot in front of RBI producers like Paul Goldschmidt and Marcell Ozuna. In other words, the rookie is a strong \u201cper dollar\u201d pick on this slate.\n\nAlso consider: Anthony Rendon, DJ LeMahieu\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nPaul DeJong - St. Louis (vs. Atlanta)\n\nDeJong follows the same rationale of his teammate, Edman, listed above. He singled and drew a walk in two at-bats against Keuchel in Game 1, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he jumped on the platoon advantage this afternoon \u2026 Trea Turner is an outstanding DFS shortstop in this slate, but DeJong could post better value with a softer price tag.\n\nAlso Consider: Trea Turner, Dansby Swanson\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nMarcell Ozuna - St. Louis (vs. Atlanta)\n\nOzuna has been a beast against left-handed pitching throughout most of his career, holding a 126 wRC+ and .205 ISO split in that regard. He has come out swinging in this series too, collecting two hits in each of the past three games. I\u2019m expecting the heater to continue today, making the St. Louis cleanup hitter a strong lift through all formats.\n\nGiancarlo Stanton - New York Yankees (at Minnesota)\n\nStanton only played nine games since coming back from a knee injury in September. There\u2019s a chance he\u2019s still somewhat rusty, but I\u2019m interested in him for DFS purposes tonight. Minnesota RHP Jake Odorizzi is a fly-ball pitcher, and the Yankees could jump all over that tonight. Stanton and Juge are the leading candidates in that regard, and the former carries a much cheaper salary. Stanton was replaced in favor of Cameron Maybin (for defense) in each of the past two games, but there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll see all nine innings if this one stays close.\n\nAlso consider: Aaron Judge, Ronald Acuna, Nelson Cruz, Dexter Fowler, Matt Joyce (punt)", "description": "Spencer Limbach runs through the best MLB DFS Plays for the four-game playoff slate on Monday, October 7.
