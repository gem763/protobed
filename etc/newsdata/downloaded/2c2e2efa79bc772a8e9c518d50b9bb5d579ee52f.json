I do have days where I weep quite a lot, partly because I'm on a hormone treatment which makes me spill over, but I do believe that crying is a very important thing to do when under this kind of stress.\"\n\nStaying Alive will give viewers a glimpse into Bill's every day-to-day life as he lives with cancer, and will show some intimate moments he shares wife his wife, Sarah, and their three children, Henry, Will and Flora.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nBill will also chat with others who've suffered from cancer, including former colleague and pal Sian Williams, and Stephen Fry.\n\nThere will also be a bit of levity though, including Bill's first crack at using cannabis oil which gives him the giggles.\n\nHe laughed: \"It made me giggle so much I couldn't string a sentence together!\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\n\"When you get diagnosed with an incurable disease you don't waste any time. I appreciate every day and live it to the full. I smile, meditate, do yoga and try to stay positive.\"\n\nHe's got a slightly more unusual way of keeping his head up - watching the hit fantasy show Game of Thrones.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of the show,\" Bill said, \"and in the last series the Red Woman tells Arya, 'What do we say to the God of Death? Not today.'\n\n\"That's my personal motto now.\"\n\nBill Turnbull: Staying Alive will show on Thursday night on Channel 4.", "description": "Presenter Bill has filmed a documentary about his incurable prostate cancer following a diagnosis two years ago", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Pa", "Getty", "Bbc", "Channel"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578980.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bill-Turnbull-Staying-Alive-DSC07526-copy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
