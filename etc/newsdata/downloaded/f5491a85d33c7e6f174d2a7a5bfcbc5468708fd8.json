Trump repeatedly credited Erdo\u011fan, hailing the strong-arm president as a \"hell of a leader.\"\n\n\"I just want to thank and congratulate President Erdo\u011fan. He\u2019s a friend of mine, and I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have a problem because, frankly, he\u2019s a hell of a leader, and he\u2019s a tough man,\" Trump told reporters while traveling in Texas.\n\n\"He\u2019s a strong man, and he did the right thing and I really appreciate it, and I will appreciate it in the future.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump said he expects Erdo\u011fan to visit the White House next month for a previously announced visit.\n\n\"What he did was very smart, and it was great for the people of Turkey,\" Trump said. \"And they\u2019re lucky that it was him that was making the decision.\"\n\nThe president's optimistic remarks came shortly after Vice President Pence announced in Ankara that the U.S. had reached a deal with Turkey to end the bloodshed in northern Syria.\n\nTurkey will suspend its operations for 120 hours to allow Kurdish fighters to withdraw from a designated safe zone along the Turkish and Syrian border, Pence said. In return, the U.S. would lift sanctions imposed this week on Turkish officials.\n\nTrump called it an \"amazing outcome\" and a \"great day for civilization.\"\n\nBut Ankara has reneged on a similar deal in the past, and Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said shortly after the announcement that it did not amount to a cease-fire.\n\n\"We will pause the operation for 120 hours in order for the terrorists to leave,\" he said. \"We will only stop the operation if our conditions are met.\"\n\nThe deal was necessitated by Trump's decision earlier this month to pull U.S. forces out of northern Syria. Within days, Turkey had advanced into the area and began attacking Kurdish fighters, leading to violence and uncertainty in the region.\n\nThe U.S. military relied on the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is led by the Kurds, as the local ground force fighting ISIS. But Ankara considers the Syrian Kurds terrorists who are an extension of a Kurdish insurgency within Turkey.", "description": "\"He\u2019s a strong man, and he did the right thing,\" Trump says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/erdogan_102318getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
