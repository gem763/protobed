A senior administration official held a call with reporters on Monday evening to explain Trump\u2019s rationale. The official, who the White House asked to have remain anonymous, dismissed a Fox News report that the Pentagon was \u201cblindsided\u201d by the pullout.\n\n\u201cThat surprises me that anyone would say that, because this is something that was discussed among senior leadership here at the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon,\u201d the official said when asked about it on the call. \u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone could have been blindsided.\u201d\n\nAsked who in government Trump consulted about the withdrawal and which officials agreed with the decision, the official declined to provide any specific names.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into each and every one of the people that the president discussed these issues with, but he discussed them with his senior advisers in ... defense, diplomatic and ... his staff here at the White House,\u201d the official said.\n\nFollowing the Fox News report, NBC News also reported top officials were \u201cblindsided\u201d by the decision.\n\nSyrian Democratic Forces and U.S. troops near the Turkish border in Hasakah, Syria, last November.

Critics, including lawmakers from Trump\u2019s own party and top U.S. allies, argue the decision to withdraw will allow Turkey to attack Kurdish forces who were allied with the United States in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal and potential for a Turkish attack on Kurdish forces also prompted concerns it would be a boon for ISIS, which Trump in March claimed was defeated.\n\nIn the wake of the White House announcement of the troop withdrawal, French Minister of the Armed Forces Florence Parly released a statement on Monday expressing fears the decision could hurt international efforts to fight ISIS, which is also known as Daesh, while posing a danger to locals.\n\n\u201cWe will be paying extremely close attention as to whether this announced U.S. withdrawal, as well as a potential Turkish offensive, create a dangerous diversion. Dangerous from the perspective of the fight against Daesh and dangerous for local populations on the ground,\u201d Parly said, adding, \u201cWe must be extremely careful to ensure that a move of this type does not strengthen Daesh \u2014 the opposite of the coalition\u2019s goal.\u201d\n\nOn the phone call with reporters, the senior administration official said Trump decided to withdraw the troops after learning that Turkey was \u201cintent\u201d on mounting a military operation in the region.\n\n\u201cTurkey appears to be set on undertaking an operation in northern Syria. That\u2019s something that the U.S. has been able to dissuade the Turks from doing for the past two years, but it appears that the Turks are intent on some sort of military operation,\u201d the official said.", "description": "A senior White House official suggested that the \u201cblindsided\u201d comment originated from disgruntled government employees.", "authors": ["Hunter Walker", "White House Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ekVYsAMso304e_jcV4g6eA--~B/aD0yOTE3O3c9NDE2NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-06/61555100-9a3b-11e9-bffd-8811edf7cba0", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
