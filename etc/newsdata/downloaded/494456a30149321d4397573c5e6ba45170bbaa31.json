Why shouldn't the Senate avoid the drama?\n\nIf House Democrats get their way, they\u2019ll vote to send articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump to the Senate in a matter of weeks. What should happen next is simple \u2014 the Senate should move quickly to vote on a resolution dismissing the House impeachment charges by a simple majority vote.\n\nThis would spare the nation the political agony of a drawn-out Senate trial, where the outcome is a foregone conclusion and the only result will be further polarization. That would allow the question of who is going to serve as president of the United States to be decided by America\u2019s voters \u2014 the people who should decide it.\n\nA political strategy\n\nHouse Democrats have made clear their move for impeachment has nothing to do with the Framers\u2019 vision of impeachment. For House Democrats, it\u2019s not about defending the Constitution against a usurper; it\u2019s merely a political response to an election they still cannot believe they lost.\n\nThey\u2019ve made clear from even before President Trump was inaugurated that they believe him to be an illegitimate president, and every action they\u2019ve taken since then proves their determination to kowtow to their left-wing base, the left-wing base that demands \u201cresistance\u201d in all its forms.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell answers questions following a Republican policy luncheon on Sept. 17, 2019.

When that narrative collapsed after a two-year investigation failed to prove it, they shifted to \u201cobstruction of justice.\u201d But that effort, too, came up short, so they have now shifted to this new charge \u2014 that he abused his office by seeking the assistance of a foreign government for personal political gain.\n\nTrump much worse than Nixon: He may even have committed treason.\n\nBut the official record of the president\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president shows no such thing. It does not show a quid pro quo, it does not show an offer of a bribe, it does not reveal the existence of a threat.\n\nMoreover, the Democrats\u2019 likely second article of impeachment \u2014 that moving the official record of the phone call from one server to another is evidence of an attempt to \u201ccover up\u201d wrongdoing \u2014 doesn\u2019t hold water, either. It turns out the decision to move similar records happened long ago, and was not confined to this one phone call.\n\nConvicting an impeached president requires a two-thirds vote. That\u2019s 67 senators. But Democrats only have 47 (if we assume Maine\u2019s Angus King and Vermont\u2019s Bernie Sanders, two independents who caucus with Senate Democrats, behave as Democrats on this vote).\n\nThus, it would require 20 Republican senators to vote to convict. That\u2019s just not going to happen.\n\nHonestly, what's the use?\n\nThe House could impeach, and then the Senate would fail to convict after a trial and the drama would end. But the polarization will have increased, and to what end?\n\nInstead, the Senate should plan for a motion to dismiss the House\u2019s charges as soon as they come over. Under the rules of the Senate, that\u2019s a perfectly legitimate move \u2014 and it only requires a simple majority vote to pass.\n\nIt has been suggested before. In the 1999 Senate impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd, one of the lions of the Senate, offered a motion to dismiss the House charges before the Senate trial began. Because Democrats were then in the minority, the motion failed.\n\nNow, for the first time during a potential impeachment trial of a sitting president, the Senate is controlled by the same party as that of the president. There are 53 Republicans in the Senate, and if they all vote to dismiss the charges, the trial could be over before it begins.\n\nHere\u2019s an even bolder play for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a man who has shown that he\u2019s not afraid to take strong stands for what he thinks is right: Circulate a letter to your GOP Senate colleagues, declaring that the undersigned will vote to dismiss House articles of impeachment against President Trump on the Ukraine matter.\n\nOnce there are at least 51 signatures on it, release the letter publicly and declare that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi might as well fold the House\u2019s impeachment circus tent now, because no matter what comes out of the House, it will go nowhere in the Senate.\n\nImpeachment whine: Trump thinks Republicans weren't tough on Obama. Believe me, we were.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi would then have an option. She could continue to move forward with impeachment proceedings, knowing her effort would be seen as nothing but political, since conviction and removal of the president from office would be off the table. Or she could shut down the circus and prepare to do battle on terrain more appropriate for deciding who gets to serve as president \u2014 the electoral battlefield we\u2019ve used quite well for close to 250 years.\n\nThe path is clear. Will McConnell make the play?\n\nJenny Beth Martin is honorary chairman of Tea Party Patriots Action.
