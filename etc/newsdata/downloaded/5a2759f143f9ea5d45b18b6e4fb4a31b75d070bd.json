It\u2019s the start of September and there\u2019s no clear-cut answer as to who is the best team in baseball.\n\nThe Houston Astros, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees are no doubt in a different class than the rest of the league. The next two months ought to crown one of them the next World Series champion, so long as October baseball doesn\u2019t go sideways (which isn\u2019t uncommon, so no guarantees).\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhile the next eight weeks should answer plenty of questions, here in the Power Rankings world there\u2019s no time to wait. Every week is about picking a No. 1 and, to be honest, every week that seems to be getting a little tougher.\n\nBefore we get to this week\u2019s pick, let\u2019s look closer at just how close together the top three are:\n\n\u2022 Their records? 90-49 for the Astros, 90-49 for the Yankees and 90-50 for the Dodgers.\n\n\u2022 Runs scored? That\u2019s 771 for both the Dodgers and Astros. The Yankees have scored more, but also allowed a lot more.\n\n\u2022 Even their recent history isn\u2019t too far off. The Astros and Yankees won five games since last week. The Dodgers won four.\n\nSo who\u2019s this week\u2019s top team? Take a look below for that, plus who else is in the Top 10 and how all 30 teams shake out.\n\nGeorge Springer and the Astros are making a case for No. 1 in the MLB Power Rankings again.

Houston Astros (90-49; last week: 3)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen the numbers are as close as they are between the Astros, Yankees and Dodgers, sometimes you just have to defer to the eye test. Maybe the metric-loving baseball fans will scoff at getting caught up in emotion, but it\u2019s hard to look at the Astros the last two games \u2014 Justin Verlander\u2019s no-hitter and Gerrit Cole striking out 14 against the Brewers \u2014 and not see a team that can beat *anyone* in the league. Between Cole, Verlander and Wade Miley, they have the three best ERAs in the AL. Their offense is tops in on-base percentage, fourth in runs scored and homers. The Astros will be tough to beat.\n\n2. New York Yankees (90-49; last week: 1)\n\nThere was nothing the Yankees did last week that necessarily hurts them here. It\u2019s more that they don\u2019t have a Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole ready to start a playoff series. They can definitely hit and have an uncanny pipeline of players ready to fill in for whoever gets injured. For the Yankees, it\u2019s still about what players are healthy on Oct. 1.\n\n3. Los Angeles Dodgers (90-50; last week: 2)\n\nThe Dodgers dropping three games to the division rival/second-place D-backs have them looking up at the two elite AL teams this week, but there\u2019s still a very good likelihood they\u2019re the first team to clinch their division. Their magic number is six after their win Monday against the Rockies.\n\n4. Atlanta Braves (85-54; last week: 4)\n\nThe Braves continue to roll in the NL. They\u2019re 54-27 since June 1, including five straight wins (albeit against the Blue Jays and White Sox) heading into this week\u2019s rankings. The question for Atlanta hasn\u2019t changed: Can their pitching hold up in October? Their 4.25 team ERA, which is 10th in MLB, doesn\u2019t match their overall place in the league hierarchy.\n\n5. Minnesota Twins (85-52; last week: 5)\n\nThe homer-smackin\u2019 Twins have won eight of nine dating back to the last week, but we hesitate to give them too much credit for their last four series being against the Tigers and White Sox twice each.\n\n6. Tampa Bay Rays (81-58; last week: 9)\n\nThe Rays sweeping the Indians was the big thing that shook up the Top 10 this week. The Rays would host the wild-card game if the playoffs were to start tomorrow, which isn\u2019t a bad place to be for them.\n\n7. Oakland A\u2019s (78-58; last week: 6)\n\nThe Yankees got some revenge on the A\u2019s, winning two of three over the weekend, including two one-run losses. Don\u2019t fret too much, A\u2019s fans: Oakland\u2019s drop in the rankings this week can also be attributed to the Rays\u2019 jump.\n\n8. Washington Nationals (77-59; last week: 8)\n\nThe Washington Nationals, ladies and gentlemen. Many people left them for dead after a slow start, but they\u2019re 53-25 since June 1. If Max Scherzer is healthy, it\u2019s not unreasonable to believe this Nats squad could be dangerous in October.\n\n9. St. Louis Cardinals (77-60; last week: 10)\n\nThe Cardinals have been up-and-down for a lot of 2019, but they\u2019ve figured it out at the right time. They finished August 18-9, which brought their second-half record up to 32-16 and gives them a three-game lead in the tight NL Central entering play Tuesday.\n\n10. Cleveland Indians (79-58; last week: 7)\n\nThe Indians getting swept by the Rays came after sweeping the Tigers, and you can take a guess which one weighed heavier in this week\u2019s rankings. What\u2019s most troubling about the Indians is that they\u2019re 20-32 against teams that are .500 or better. That\u2019s easily the worst mark of any postseason contender.\n\nNEXT UP\n\n11. Chicago Cubs (74-63; last week: 11)\n\n12. Boston Red Sox (74-63; last week: 12)\n\n13. Milwaukee Brewers (70-67; last week: 14)\n\n14. Philadelphia Phillies (71-65; last week: 13)\n\n15. Arizona Diamondbacks (71-67; last week 16)\n\nThe gap between this group and the top 10 seems bigger than it\u2019s been in a while. All the NL teams are alive and well in the postseason chase, with the Cubs holding onto the second wild-card spot. The Red Sox, on the other hand, aren\u2019t getting much closer in the AL. The D-backs, despite recently setting a record for being one of the most OK teams in history, are hanging tough in the wild-card race. The Brewers are four games out of the second wild-card spot, but consider this: There\u2019s only one team in MLB (the Braves) that has more wins than Milwaukee against teams with records better than .500.\n\nCubs center fielder Albert Almora Jr. (5) rounds third base to score against the Seattle Mariners during the seventh inning at Wrigley Field on Monday. (David Banks-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIT\u2019S NOT LOOKING GOOD\n\n16. New York Mets (70-67; last week: 15)\n\n17. Texas Rangers (68-71; last week: 18)\n\n18. San Francisco Giants (66-71; last week: 16)\n\n19. Los Angeles Angels (65-73; last week: 19)\n\n20. San Diego Padres (64-73; last week: 21)\n\nRemember when the Giants looked like they could make a postseason run and didn\u2019t trade Madison Bumgarner at the deadline? Those days are not today, friends. The Mets are a more current version of that story \u2014 and their recent play suggests the postseason probably isn\u2019t in their future either. Even though they\u2019re only four games out of the second wild card, there are three teams between them and the second-wild-card-holding Cubs.\n\nIT\u2019S PRETTY MUCH A WRAP\n\n21. Cincinnati Reds (64-74; last week: 20)\n\n22. Pittsburgh Pirates (60-77; last week: 25)\n\n23. Chicago White Sox (60-76; last week: 22)\n\n24. Colorado Rockies (59-80; last week: 24)\n\n25. Seattle Mariners (58-81; last week: 23)\n\nNobody on this portion of the list was expected to be particularly good, but the Rockies have to the biggest surprise of the bunch. They\u2019re not rebuilding and have made some win-now moves the past couple years, but 80 losses in early September? A mark of 15-35 since the All-Star break? Yikes. Losing eight in a row certainly hasn\u2019t helped that.\n\nTHE CELLAR\n\n26. Toronto Blue Jays (55-84; last week: 26)\n\n27. Miami Marlins (48-88; last week: 27)\n\n28. Kansas City Royals (49-89; last week: 28)\n\n29. Baltimore Orioles (45-92; last week: 29)\n\n30. Detroit Tigers (40-95; last week: 30)\n\nIn the race to the bottom, the Tigers could be the first team to hit 100 losses by the time next week\u2019s rankings come out. The Marlins are the only team of this bunch who haven\u2019t been completely mathematically eliminated for postseason contention, which is mostly because the NL is a jumbled mess, but still ... Yeah, Jeets!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMike Oz is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip? Email him at mikeozstew@yahoo.com or follow him on Twitter!
