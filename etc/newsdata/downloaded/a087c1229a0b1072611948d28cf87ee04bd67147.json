Taylor \u2013 October 22, 2019\n\nMr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to appear today to provide my perspective on the events that are the subject of the Committees\u2019 inquiry. My sole purpose is to provide the Committees with my views about the strategic importance of Ukraine to the United States as well as additional information about the incidents in question.\n\nI have dedicated my life to serving U.S. interests at home and abroad in both military and civilian roles. My background and experience are nonpartisan and I have been honored to serve under every administration, Republican and Democratic, since 1985.\n\nFor 50 years, I have served the country, starting as a cadet at West Point, then as an infantry officer for six years, including with the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam; then at the Department of Energy; then as a member of a Senate staff; then at NATO; then with the State Department here and abroad \u2014 in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jerusalem, and Ukraine; and more recently, as Executive Vice President of the nonpartisan United States Institute of Peace.\n\nWhile I have served in many places and in different capacities, I have a particular interest in and respect for the importance of our country\u2019s relationship with Ukraine. Our national security demands that this relationship remain strong, However, in August and September of this year, I became increasingly concerned that our relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons. I hope my remarks today will help the Committees understand why I believed that to be the case.\n\nAt the outset, I would like to convey several key points. First, Ukraine is a strategic partner of the United States, important for the security of our country as well as Europe. Second, Ukraine is, right at this moment \u2014 while we sit in this room \u2014 and for the last five years, under armed attack from Russia. Third, the security assistance we provide is crucial to Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russian aggression, and, more importantly, sends a signal to Ukrainians \u2014 and Russians \u2014 that we are Ukraine\u2019s reliable strategic partner. And finally, as the Committees are now aware, I said on September 9 in a message to Ambassador Gordon Sondland that withholding security assistance in exchange for help with a domestic political campaign in the United States would be \u201ccrazy.\u201d I believed that then, and I still believe that.\n\n1", "description": "William B.
