The Magic Wand, the Magnetic Lasso, and the Quick Selections tools were all big improvements, but Photoshop\u2019s AI-powered \u201cSelect Subject\u201d tool was the quantum leap pixel pushers had long dreamed of, and Adobe will soon be making it even smarter.\n\nIntroduced to Photoshop CC last year, the Select Subject tool is a simple one-click affair that leverages the AI capabilities of the cloud-based Adobe Sensei to analyse an image, determine what the most important subject matter is, and then automatically create a selection mask around it. The tool is completely automated which is a good and bad thing. When it works properly it can reduce many time-consuming steps to a single click, but if it incorrectly guesses what object is being edited, or does a poor job at close cropping with the selection mask it creates, it can leave a photo editor with a lot of cleanups and additional work to do.\n\nFrom my own experience, the Select Subject tool is a neat glimpse at the potential AI has to automate and streamline the workflow of an incredibly complex piece of software. But I have yet to find it reliable enough to integrate into my daily workflow, although that could soon change.\n\nAhead of the Adobe Max conference taking place in Los Angeles next week, the company has teased a new and improved version of Photoshop\u2019s Select Subject tool, now known as the Object Selection tool. The name change doesn\u2019t make it sound particularly groundbreaking, but instead of relying on Adobe Sensei to automatically guess what object in a photo a user wants to edit, the Select Subject tool now lets users draw a box around the object or multiple objects, and Photoshop will automatically create a close-cropped selection around them.\n\nLast year\u2019s version of this tool felt a lot like a tech demo; something that could wow an audience, but wasn\u2019t quite ready to become an integral part of a Photoshop artist\u2019s workflow. However, by getting it in the hands of the Photoshop user base as early as possible, Adobe was able to improve its capabilities as the deep learning algorithms that power the tool improve as it\u2019s actually used. The new Object Selection tool looks like something I\u2019d actually employ on a regular basis as it allows additional objects to be quickly added or subtracted from a selection by just drawing boxes around them. There will undoubtedly still be some refinement needed after the fact, but this latest Photoshop update seems like it could take a big bite out of a photo editor\u2019s workload.", "description": "Adobe has been slowly upgrading Photoshop with better tools to make the worst photo editing task\u2014close cropping complex objects\u2014less of a pain.
