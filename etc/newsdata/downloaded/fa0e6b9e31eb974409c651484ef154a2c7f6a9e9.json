Every single person in Korea\u2019s biggest musical act has glowy, bouncy skin, and it\u2019s in large part due to Korean beauty. The group is so into moisturizing that they\u2019ve partnered with Mediheal, Korea\u2019s biggest sheet-mask company, several times to create limited-edition versions. Every time, the masks sell out, but the Cut was lucky enough to nab the most recent one. Here\u2019s what happens when you try to stay damp like a K-Pop star.\n\nErica Smith, Beauty Writer\n\nMy favorite part about this mask is it\u2019s really slimy \u2014 in a good way, like it\u2019s not messing around. My second favorite thing is that it comes in a heart-shaped bowl, which eliminates mess while unfolding the sheet and ensures all the goopy goodness stays on the mask, rather than in the crevices of a regular wrapper. My third favorite thing about this mask was how well it adhered to my face. It\u2019s very snug, like a comforting (if creepy-looking) second skin. Fourthly, it has the most satisfying peel when it comes time to remove.\n\nI tried the soothing mask, and while I didn\u2019t notice any visible effects, my face did feel more chill. Like it had been hugged. I was expecting my skin to look dewier and wetter post-masking, but it seemed like the majority of the product actually sank all the way into my skin, which I guess is what you should want at the end of the day.\n\nCallie Beusman, News Editor\n\nI love BTS, to an extent that may seem disconcerting to a person who lacks the enthusiasm and good taste I am fortunate enough to possess. I have seen them perform live twice in the past year. I religiously watch all of their reality shows, including the second and third ones, which are now defunct. I have spent human currency on their incredibly tedious iPhone game. For this reason, I felt very qualified to review their newest collaboration with Mediheal.\n\nThe masks came in little geometric boxes that evoke jewels, which seems not-standard (but what do I know!). Since there were three of them, I decided to enlist my sister and my best friend, whom I have dragged into my yearlong BTS spiral, to test them with me. The first thing we noticed was that they were incredibly moist, like the moistest thing one could imagine. They were simply dripping with \u2026 something that makes you beautiful \u2026 when we extracted them from their carriers. They also smelled really good. \u201cIt looked like a plastic trash bag salvaged from the ocean,\u201d my sister said when asked for her review of the mask she used. My friend agreed that the presentation seemed weird, \u201cbut since BTS stood behind it, so do we!!!\u201d How did we look afterward? To be honest, I am not attuned enough to the subtle fluctuations of my face to notice whether applying sheet masks makes an impact, but we all feel on a spiritual level that the process left us incredibly soft and beautiful.\n\nKathleen Hou, Beauty Director\n\nI miss the good old days when boy bands weren\u2019t so good at beauty. Back in my day, the Backstreet Boys probably collectively shared one bar soap from their danky tour bus and thought a smoky eye was a type of fancy cigarette from France. Nowadays, K-Pop boy bands have better makeup and dewier skin than me and it is annoying.\n\nIt\u2019s only fitting that Korea\u2019s biggest boy group partner with the country\u2019s biggest sheet-mask company (rumored to sell five sheet masks every second). I like how this sheet mask molded to my face so closely that I looked like Voldemort. Even better, I like how bright my skin looked after using it. Although my face felt moist for hours after, it wasn\u2019t so wet that I couldn\u2019t apply makeup over it. These masks are very, very good. If I were a pop star, I would definitely make them a part of my tour rider.\n\nDaise Bedolla, Social Editor\n\nI don\u2019t listen to BTS on a daily basis, but on the list of celebrities whose skin secrets I want, they are at the top. After using their \u201cmoisturizing\u201d mask, I\u2019m officially a hydrogel-mask convert. My usual cotton sheet masks just can\u2019t hold up to the gooey, slippery goodness of this one. It fit my face perfectly and barely slipped as I walked around my apartment. I kept it on through an episode of Friends, patted the leftover serum on my neck, and continued my usual routine. The next morning, my face looked glowy and bright, and had a supple bounce like I\u2019d slept eight hours and not just six.\n\nDevon Sherer, Snapchat Producer\n\nI loved these masks. The packaging, while not very ecofriendly, was super cute. Each mask felt a little different (some were more tingly than others), but they were all very easy to apply. And unlike many masks, they weren\u2019t hard to position or so heavy that they fell off. My skin was dewy for hours, and it continued to feel super moisturized for two straight days.\n\nMediheal Bio Capsulin Love Me Mask Set $20 at Beautytap Buy\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Reviews of Korean pop group BTS\u2019s favorite sheet masks, from the brand Mediheal.
