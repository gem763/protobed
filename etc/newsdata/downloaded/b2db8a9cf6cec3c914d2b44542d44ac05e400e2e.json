Musk responded with a series of erratic tweets calling Unsworth a \u201cpedo guy\u201d. He later called him a \u201cchild rapist\u201d in emails to a BuzzFeed reporter.\n\nMusk\u2019s lawyers have argued these statements were simply insults, not accusations. They reiterated that on Monday, saying \u201cpedo guy\u201d was a common insult used when Musk was a child in South Africa and is not meant to \u201caccuse a person of acts of pedophilia\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that Mr Musk intended or believed that his July 15 tweets, that Mr Unsworth was \u2018sus\u2019 or \u2018pedo guy\u2019, would be interpreted as fact,\u201d the filing said. \u201cTo the contrary, the evidence is that Mr Musk believed and intended his statements to be read as what they were: bare insults.\u201d\n\nThis defense comes despite follow-up tweets from Musk, which said \u201cbet you a signed dollar it\u2019s true\u201d, implying he indeed believed Unsworth was a pedophile. Lawyers for Musk said said in Monday\u2019s court filing that while his initial tweets were intended as a joke, he continued to call Unsworth a \u201cpedo guy\u201d in subsequent tweets because of \u201cdisturbing information\u201d allegedly uncovered in a private investigation funded by Musk himself.\n\n\u201cThe investigator reported that Mr Unsworth was a fixture in Pattaya Beach, Thailand \u2013 a locale notorious for prostitution and child trafficking, that he had a taste for young Thai girls, that he whoremongered his way through the go-go bars of Thailand, that his only friends were his \u2018sexpat\u2019 peers, and that he married his Thai wife when she was a teenager, after starting a relationship when she was a young girl,\u201d the response from Musk\u2019s lawyers reads.\n\nUnsworth, who shares a home in Thailand with his 40-year-old partner, has denied these allegations. Lawyers for Musk and Unsworth did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nIn another scandal surrounding the suit, Musk\u2019s lawyers are attempting to drag a BuzzFeed News reporter into the proceedings. Musk first brought up the pedophilia allegations in what he believed to be an \u201coff-the-record\u201d email sent to Ryan Mac, a BuzzFeed News reporter, in August 2018. Though Musk claimed the email was off the record, Mac \u2013 who never agreed to such a stipulation \u2013 published it in full.\n\nNow Musk\u2019s lawyers are attempting to force the reporter to testify in the lawsuit, and BuzzFeed is pushing back in a filing made on Friday, saying there is no legal reason for it.\n\n\u201cIt is clear from Musk\u2019s prior conduct that he would put Mac through the ordeal of a hostile deposition for no reason other than to retaliate against Mac for his critical reporting,\u201d the filing said. \u201cThe deposition subpoenas must be quashed to avoid this oppressive outcome.\u201d\n\nIt has not yet been decided if BuzzFeed will testify in the case as Musk continues to challenge the defamation claim. The trial is scheduled for 2 December 2019.", "description": "Tesla CEO\u2019s lawyers said \u2018pedo guy\u2019 is a common insult used when Musk was a child in South Africa and not meant to \u2018accuse a person\u2019", "authors": ["Kari Paul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cc5373b22b7aa022f4cbfe7434c80e40ed7dc79/0_36_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=52e3dc99aeff74c66db98601d9fb864f", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
