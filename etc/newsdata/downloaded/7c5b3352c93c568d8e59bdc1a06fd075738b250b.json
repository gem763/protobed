I don't put chips on the bedposts. I haven't a clue and have never thought about calculating.'\n\nHowever he also went on to admit that despite his fame and many career highs he was unhappy - and this led him to partying hard between 1996 and 1999. But he knew that his lifestyle had to stop - otherwise he would face burnout.\n\n'I realised I couldn't go on like this this, rolling out of night clubs at 4am every morning, week on week, basically wandering around like a playboy,' he admitted.\n\nMick, left, with band mates from Simply Red, claimed that what he said was not 'literally' what he meant and that parts of the interview were 'conflated'\n\nWhile discussing his love life in 2010 Hucknall said that he was 'living the dream' and that his 'only regret is that I hurt some really good girls'\n\nHe admits that he tried Heroin when he was a student and admitted that 'much like every other musician - I have tried everything'. However he called it a 'pointless' drug.\n\nHe went on to reveal that he enjoyed the lifestyle for a while, but it got 'boring' - and instead he wanted to find something with more meaning.\n\nThe singer now lives with his wife Gabriella Wesberry, who he tied the knot with at Forter Castle in Perthshire, Scotland, almost a decade ago.\n\nThe pair have a daughter together, called Romy True, who was born in 2007 and they live together in his Surrey mansion with their dog.\n\nHe went on to reveal that he enjoyed the lifestyle for a while, but it gets 'boring' - and instead he wanted to find something with more meaning\n\nThe singer admits in the interview that his drinking and diet habits have changed - and two days a week he becomes a vegetarian and even holds back on the wine.\n\nWhile discussing his love life in 2010, Hucknall famously said: 'Between 1985 - 1987, I would sleep with about three women a day, every day.\n\n'I never said no. This was what I wanted from being a pop star. I was living the dream and my only regret is that I hurt some really good girls.'\n\nIt was the latest calculation surrounding speculation over his love life, stemming from a 2000 interview with the Scottish Daily Record.\n\nThe singer now lives with his wife Gabriella Wesberry (right) who he tied the knot with at Forter Castle in Perthshire, Scotland, almost a decade ago\n\nMick and hios wife Gabriella at The Spectator summer party in Westminster in 2015\n\nAt that time he told the publication, 'I'm not married, so I can sleep with whoever I want', and that, as his mother left when he was a three years old, he 'treats girls as mates you can have sex with'.\n\nA documentary in 2004, entitled 'Is She Really Going Out With Him?' added to the speculation after it claimed that the singer had slept with more than 4,000 women.\n\nIn 2012 he tried to correct the figure, telling the Irish Independent: 'If you actually take a look at what I said in the infamous interview and what the editor introduced, you can see that they are slightly different.\n\n'I didn't apologise to 3,000 women. The 3,000 wasn't my figure. That was the editor's figure.'\n\nHis revelations comes as the band, formed in Manchester in the 1980s, releases their first new album in four years, entitled Blue Eyed Soul.", "description": "Simply Red singer Mick Hucknall, 59,\u00a0who now lives in Surrey, claimed his comments were taken 'wildly out of context' in the interview, and that he hadn't meant the comment 'literally'.", "authors": ["Luke Andrews For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/10/19952398-0-image-a-8_1571565443984.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
