Look at Chicago. Disarming law-abiding citizens isn\u2019t the answer. Stopping violent criminals\u2014prosecuting & getting them off the street\u2014BEFORE they commit more violent crimes is the most effective way to reduce murder rates. Let\u2019s protect our citizens. https://t.co/znHO31gDH2 \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 2, 2019\n\nIn response, Lightfoot noted that the majority of illegal guns recovered in the city can be traced to surrounding, Republican-controlled states, which lack stringent gun-control measures.\n\nWhen @tedcruz and the @gop dismiss common sense gun policies, they disrespect victims and their families, who deserve to live without pain and fear. \u2014 Lori Lightfoot (@LightfootForChi) September 3, 2019\n\nThe confrontation comes amid a flurry of mass shootings that have resulted in heightened partisan debates over the merits of various gun-control proposals.\n\nDemocratic presidential aspirant Beto O\u2019Rourke reiterated his support for a federal AR-15-purchasing program in which tens of thousands of Americans would voluntarily turn in their weapons, and those who refused would be subject to criminal prosecution.\n\n\u201cI want to be really clear that that\u2019s exactly what we are going to do,\u201d the former Texas congressman said when asked to respond to voters concerned about being forcibly disarmed by the government. \u201cAmericans who own AR-15s, AK-47s, will have to sell them to the government.\u201d\n\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that he would bring to the floor any gun-control legislation that was supported by the White House.\n\nThe administration \u201cis in the process of studying what they\u2019re prepared to support, if anything,\u201d McConnell told radio host Hugh Hewitt. \u201cI expect to get an answer to that next week. If the president is in favor of a number of things that he has discussed openly and publicly and I know that if we pass it, it will become law, I\u2019ll put it on the floor.\u201d\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot lashed out at Senator Ted Cruz Tuesday in response to Cruz's suggestion that her city's decades-long struggle with gun violence proves the futility of stringent gun-control legislation.Lightfoot told Cruz to \u201ckeep our name out of your mouth\u201d after the Texas Republican", "authors": ["Jack Crowe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o74UN_39GkvgqArT72fZ5Q--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/slick_thumb/giraffe-304415-1567552498934.jpg"}
