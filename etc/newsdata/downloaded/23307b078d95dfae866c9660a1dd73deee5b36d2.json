Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Shazam! all managed to engage audiences without cramming dozens of costumed crime fighters into the same movie. Freed from the need to maintain thematic integrity across multiple episodes, Warner\u2019s superhero movies have finally found their feet. So much so that it is tempting to wonder if the long-mooted DC Extended Universe, always planned as a Marvel-aping excuse to cross-pollinate the publisher\u2019s entire back catalogue, has already met an untimely demise.\n\nJames Gunn\u2019s upcoming Suicide Squad 2 may do its best to pull out the creative defibrillator when it finally debuts in 2021, but in the meantime, there are rumours of a rather more intriguing example of inter-superhero shenanigans. Could Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman really end up in the same movie as Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Joker, currently picking up rave reviews in Venice? A slip of the tongue by Pattinson in a new interview suggests so.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Slip of the tongue ... Robert Pattinson.

It is hard to imagine a Batman movie featuring Phoenix\u2019s Scorsese-inspired, 70s crime movie-style take on the clown prince of Gotham not hitting it off creatively with the taciturn caped crusader everyone hopes to see in Matt Reeves\u2019 forthcoming The Batman. The inclusion of both actors hints at a character-driven, cine-literate piece that couldn\u2019t be further from the monstrously lightweight CGI-strewn nonsense of the worst DC releases. Why bother to set up Phoenix\u2019s Arthur Fleck in such detail if he merely exists to be retooled as a common baddie in future instalments?\n\nOf course, the inclusion of top talent doesn\u2019t always guarantee quality film-making \u2013 just ask the Oscar-winning Jared Leto, sort-of star of Suicide Squad, in which he played a version of the Joker so superfluous to events it would probably have been easier and cheaper to render the villain entirely via CGI. But setting Pattinson against Phoenix would at least create the kind of positive buzz around a major movie event that Warner needs if it is ever to match Marvel\u2019s box office might and critical currency.\n\nThe hype around Joker is such that Warner would be foolish not to make Todd Phillips\u2019 film a jumping-off point for a fresh Gotham-themed mini-universe. Perhaps DC fans might even find themselves gifted the interconnected series of movies that the DC Extended Universe was intended to usher in, through a surprising route. If Warner has largely failed in its efforts to mimic Marvel\u2019s industry-shaking success, that does not mean the studio cannot find an alternate, more organic route to world-building that better fits the superheroes and film-makers at its disposal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Superfluous ...

Bruce Wayne\u2019s father Thomas appears in Phillips\u2019 movie as a tyrannical Trump figure, played by 63-year-old actor Brett Cullen, while Wayne is portrayed by nine-year-old actor Dante Pereira-Olson. This suggests Phoenix\u2019s Fleck won\u2019t be battling a Pattinson-aged caped crusader for at least a decade or two. On the other hand, that gives DC plenty of time to finally get this new cinematic mini-verse right. The fan anticipation that would build in the meantime could be enough to make the Avengers look like the Powerpuff Girls.", "description": "Could Warner Bros finally match Marvel\u2019s box office might with a mini-verse featuring Robert Pattinson\u2019s caped crusader and Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Arthur Fleck?", "authors": ["Ben Child"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3aadce3ce558815932ecb13c2859cf14a300d4d/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3f834c6b8ca5f609e9607cc4ae458af7", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
