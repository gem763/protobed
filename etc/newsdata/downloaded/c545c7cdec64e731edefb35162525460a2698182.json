It is the first time France has undertaken a comprehensive national effort to address domestic abuse, according to the equality secretary, Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa.\n\nMacron hears police officer refuse to help woman in danger Read more\n\nOther proposals include mandatory reporting requirements for health professionals who witness signs of domestic abuse and new protocols for police responding to abuse complaints. The experts also are encouraging awareness programmes, urging banks to make it easier for victims of domestic abuse to leave their partners and educating children and adolescents about gender equality.\n\nSchiappa said most domestic abuse killings in France were carried out with guns, arguing that if authorities took away the weapons, it could reduce such deaths.\n\nFrench law enforcement has been criticised for failing to quickly and adequately respond to domestic abuse complaints. The government began to treat the issue with increased urgency after the president, Emmanuel Macron, visited a domestic abuse hotline in September and observed a police officer rejecting a woman\u2019s call for help.\n\nSchiappa, who is overseeing the government commission, told a news conference on Tuesday that the recommendations marked an important step toward \u201ca system of zero tolerance\u201d for all types of domestic abuse.\n\nThe commission also urged greater awareness of the psychological effects of domestic abuse, including when victims feel so trapped in a toxic relationship that they decide to kill themselves. In 2018, 217 French women killed themselves for this reason, according to the lawyer and domestic abuse specialist Yael Muller.\n\nDomestic violence and guns: the hidden American crisis ending women's lives Read more\n\nSchiappa said it was important to recognise psychological and economic abuse as just as pernicious as physical blows.\n\n\u201cWe still have an enormous amount to do to make progress against domestic violence, because for years, despite all the efforts of previous ministers, the number of femicides has not decreased,\u201d said Schiappa.\n\nThe recommendations will now go to government ministries and France\u2019s national assembly and senate to consider turning them into law. The commission will formally conclude its work on 25 November, the international day for the elimination of violence against women.\n\nIn the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic violence helpline is 0808 2000 247.
