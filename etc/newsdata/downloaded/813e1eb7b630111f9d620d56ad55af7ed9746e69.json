Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign.\n\nThe creator of \u201cDilbert\u201d looked at a Nickelback parody video shared by Mr. Trump on Thursday and all but declared Mr. Biden\u2019s presidential hopes extinguished.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s clip of the Democrat and his son Hunter golfing in 2014 with Burisma Holdings board member Devon Archer was viewed over 2.7 million times in less than two hours.\n\nIt also became a top-trending topic on Twitter under the hashtag \u201cNickelback.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are now entered the \u2018violating the corpse\u2019 phase of Biden\u2019s presidential campaign,\u201d Mr. Adams tweeted.\n\nWe are now entered the \u201cviolating the corpse\u201d phase of Biden\u2019s presidential campaign.\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 https://t.co/CP70yGHIIV \u2014 Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) October 2, 2019\n\nThe \u201cWin Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don\u2019t Matter\u201d also predicted that Mr. Trump would survive the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation while other commentators predicted it would lead to impeachment.\n\n\u201cSo [former CIA Director John O.] Brennan may have started one of the most important political witch hunts in history based on not recognizing a joke \u2014 and I\u2019m not even making that up,\u201d Mr. Adams said in August 2018. \u201cI feel fairly confident in saying that what I just said is literally true: that the head of the CIA has almost destroyed the United States because he didn\u2019t understand that an obvious joke was a joke.\u201d\n\nProminent Democrats have called for impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump because he spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about an abandoned investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s ties to Burisma Holdings.\n\nMr. Trump insists that he is being pilloried for trying asking about a legitimate issue and the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division determined that no campaign finance laws were violated during the call.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about [former Vice President Joseph R.] Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,\u201d Mr. Trump said to Mr. Zelensky. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. See if you can look into it. \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s tweet features a Sept. 21 exchange between Mr. Biden and Fox News\u2019 Peter Doocy on the campaign trail in Iowa.\n\n\u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\u201d Mr. Biden said earlier this month. \u201cI know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader? Trying to intimidate a foreign leader, if that\u2019s what happened, that appears to be what happened, you should be looking at Trump. Trump\u2019s doing this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum. And he\u2019s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me. \u2026 Everybody looked at this, and everybody\u2019s looked at it and said there\u2019s nothing there.
