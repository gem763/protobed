And heighten awareness of some returning characters - albeit in different roles.\n\nSome of teams are also taking the stage in different roles, too.\n\nBy the quirks of the system, Ireland is ranked No. 1, a position the two-time defending champion New Zealand All Blacks are more accustomed to.\n\nThe Springboks also threw in a twist, arriving in Japan as the southern hemisphere\u2019s Rugby Championship winners after a 16-16 draw with New Zealand. That sets up a blockbuster on the opening weekend with a Pool B clash against the All Blacks.\n\nJones is in Japan as England coach, hoping he\u2019s scripted his team\u2019s run to perfection. He took the job after England\u2019s group-stage exit four years ago - the first host nation to miss out on qualifying for the knockout rounds - and after orchestrating Japan\u2019s 34-32 triumph over two-time champion South Africa at Brighton. That\u2019s was the so-called miracle.\n\nJapan hadn\u2019t won a game at the previous five World Cups and only had one victory - in 1991 - to its credit, but somehow managed to beat the powerful Springboks, one of three wins that almost got them into the quarterfinals.\n\nThe pressure is now on coach Jamie Joseph, a former All Blacks forward, to produce a sequel for Japan in a group that also contains Ireland, Scotland and Samoa.\n\n\u201cWe understand the responsibility that goes alongside being the host nation,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cI understand that it\u2019s crucial for the ongoing development of the game that we play a brand of rugby that is exciting, attractive (and) great to watch.\u201d\n\nHe has a plan to upset the Irish or Scotland and is aiming to reach the quarterfinals, and it could be a real spoiler.\n\nWhile Joseph is conscious of growing the game, Jones has switched his attention to fine-tuning his big-budget English team to fulfill its potential and collect a second World Cup title.\n\nEngland\u2019s 57-15 win over Ireland last month was an indication of how prepared the team is for Japan, having gone through a form slump after winning 17 tests straight from February 2016 to March 2017. Fifth place in the 2018 Six Nations was followed by some disappointments again this season - letting a 31-0 lead slip in a 38-38 draw against Scotland and a 21-13 loss to Wales in Cardiff.\n\n\u201cAre we moving in the right direction? Yes,\u201d Jones said in the wake of that win over Ireland. \u201cAre we ready to win the World Cup now? No.\u201d\n\nThat is classic Jones lingo meaning not ready, yet.\n\nA wily tactician, Jones steered Australia to an unlikely World Cup final appearance in 2003 - losing the decider to England in extra-time - and was a coaching consultant for South Africa\u2019s title win four years later. His work with Japan only enhanced his CV.\n\nHe\u2019s comfortable in the tournament environment and feels right at home in Japan, thanks to his Japanese mother and his time spent there.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the road is entirely smooth, though, with England facing three-time finalist France and two-time semifinalist Argentina in Pool C after opening with games against Tonga and the United States.\n\nOnly two teams from each group can advance to the quarterfinals, where the likely opponents are two-time champion Australia, Six Nations Grand Slam winner Wales or Fiji, the big potential sleeper in Pool D.\n\nThe All Blacks, chasing an unprecedented third consecutive title, and two-time champion Springboks should have too much firepower in Pool B for Italy, Canada and Namibia, with the main question really only about the finishing order.\n\nSteve Hansen, who was assistant coach when New Zealand won on home soil in 2011 and guided the All Blacks to victory as head coach in 2015, is returning along with skipper Kieran Read.\n\nThe All Blacks\u2019 aura of invincibility has been eroded in the last 12 months with losses to Ireland, South Africa and Australia. But the All Blacks responded to the latest loss with a comprehensive 36-0 win over Australia in Auckland and followed up with a commanding 92-7 win over Tonga before heading to Japan.\n\nAfter the loss to Ireland in Dublin last October, Hansen said the Irish deserved to be considered the No. 1-ranked team in the world, although that numeric status didn\u2019t eventuate until this month. It plays perfectly into Hansen\u2019s strategy of making somebody else the favorite.\n\n\u201cThis World Cup looks like it\u2019s going to be the most fiercely contested tournament yet with a number of teams turning up in Japan thinking they\u2019re going to win it,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to create some expectations on them, too. And, with that expectation, pressure.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re going to have a small advantage.\u201d\n\nSecond place in Pool B will likely meet Ireland in the quarterfinals. After an outstanding 2018 that included that drought-breaking win over the All Blacks and a Six Nations sweep, the Irish appear to have targeting the World Cup at the expense of other trophies this season.\n\nLosses to Wales and England in the Six Nations were followed by the big loss to England last month.\n\nBut the recent 19-10 win over Wales in Dublin was the change in momentum coach Joe Schmidt demanded.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d won three of the last five Six Nations, we didn\u2019t need another one of those,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cWe need a semifinal in this big competition coming up. If decide where your priorities are, you give yourself a better chance.\u201d\n\n__\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It was timed for impact, days before the start of the first Rugby World Cup staged in Asia.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Pye"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/japan_rugby_17301_c0-146-3500-2186_s1770x1032.jpg?28e1112a076ec7fecf74d701fc168de288d8a301", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
