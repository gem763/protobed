(Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Office)\n\nThe House will hold a hearing this fall to investigate how Veterans Affairs awards credentials to its doctors amid concerns that the agency failed to stop an Arkansas pathologist who is alleged to have misdiagnosed thousands of veterans while impaired, lawmakers said Tuesday.\n\nHouse Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee Chairman Mark Takano (D-Calif.) said lawmakers will \u201cdo oversight on a bipartisan basis\u201d to scrutinize both the Arkansas case and VA\u2019s broader system of giving credentials and hospital privileges to physicians in its vast heath-care system, which has come under growing scrutiny in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cI heard about the situation with the pathologist, and I was appalled,\u201d Takano told Rep. Steve Womack (R), whose northwest Arkansas district includes the VA medical center where Robert Morris Levy was chief pathologist for 12 years.\n\n\u201cI want you to know this committee is taking action,\u201d Takano told Womack, who appeared before the panel to plead for an investigation of VA\u2019s conduct in the Levy case.\n\n\u201cWe will get to the bottom of this,\u201d the chairman said. A hearing is likely to happen in October or November, a committee spokesman said.\n\nLevy, 53, is awaiting trial in jail in Fayetteville after his indictment in August on charges of involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of three veterans, as well as other federal charges.\n\nA review of 34,000 tissue and fluid samples he read from 2005 to 2017 found an error rate of nearly 10 percent, 10 times the average rate of mistakes for pathologists, prosecutors found.\n\nMany of the errors led to misdiagnoses that harmed the health of the veterans in VA\u2019s care. They showed cancer when there was none or, more often, failed to find cancer or other illnesses, according to investigators. The mistakes led to the deaths of at least 15 veterans, officials have said.\n\nThe Levy case is not the only criminal proceeding VA is facing. Inspector General Michael Missal and federal prosecutors are investigating at least 11 suspicious deaths after unnecessary insulin injections by a nursing assistant at VA\u2019s hospital in Clarksburg, W.Va., two of which have now been ruled homicides. And a physician at the Beckley, W.Va., medical center is under investigation after being accused of sexually assaulting numerous veterans in his care.\n\n\u201cThe shocking reports from West Virginia and Arkansas call into question whether VA is equipped to identify clinicians who are negligent, abusive, or commit criminal acts \u2014 and prevent them from practicing,\u201d Takano said in a statement.\n\nThe cases have also raised questions about the agency\u2019s controls over hospital staff\u2019s access to drugs and its ability to track their use.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Wanda Shull, a spokeswoman for Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks, said the Arkansas hospital \u201cused all legal measures in its control to fire this individual as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nShe said VA \u201cacted quickly to remove him from clinical care\u201d and revoked his clinical privileges \u201cwhen he was found to be unsafe to work.\u201d\n\nBut the medical center\u2019s chief physician at the time had received complaints from Levy\u2019s colleagues in the pa\u00adthol\u00adogy lab for years, interviews and documents show, and he agreed to send him to an alcohol treatment program at taxpayer expense in 2016 after he was found drunk on the job with a blood alcohol level of 0.4, five times the legal limit for driving in Arkansas.\n\nLevy was permitted to return to the Fayetteville VA as chief pathologist with mandatory alcohol screenings \u2014 but with no additional oversight of his clinical performance.\n\n\u201cHe was returned to duty,\u201d Womack told the committee. \u201cA doctor who had showed up to work while intoxicated was returned to duty to care for our veterans. This is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nHe asked lawmakers to \u201cinvestigate the actions and decisions made by the VA throughout the entirety of his episode.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe in second chances,\u201d the congressman said, \u201cbut not in life or death situations. Without the proper safeguards in place, there was no accountability, and we\u2019ve seen the result.\u201d\n\nLevy was found severely impaired at work about a year later when he arrived to lead a meeting of the hospital\u2019s tumor board, which he chaired. This time, prosecutors would discover that he had found a substance called 2-methyl-2-butanal that gave him the high of alcohol but that could not be detected on routine drug and alcohol tests.\n\nLevy was not returned to clinical duty but remained on the VA staff for five more months until an arrest for driving under the influence.\n\nInvestigators also would find that VA had allowed Levy to hide his mistakes for years by altering the results of the routine peer review process required of all pathologists. When his deputy found errors, Levy changed the records, making it look like he had made none.\n\nRep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), Veterans' Affairs Committee\u2019s top Republican and a physician, described a peer review system in private hospitals with far more oversight.\n\n\u201cFor doctors who have come through a rehab program, I can assure you that you don\u2019t get to supervise yourself,\u201d Roe said. \u201cThat was the great flaw here that occurred. You put the supervisor back as the supervisor. That should never have happened.\u201d", "description": "Cases in Arkansas and West Virginia have raised questions about the ability of Veterans Affairs to identify clinicians involved in misconduct and to act quickly to prevent them from practicing.", "authors": ["Lisa Rein", "Reporter Covering Federal Agencies", "The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hMxJmk3BoX0LzT8l5D3460ORY5c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4OTV67GDLUI6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
