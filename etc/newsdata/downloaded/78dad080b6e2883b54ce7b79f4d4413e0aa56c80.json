The office concluded last month that the prime minister breached the constitution by failing to recite the full oath.\n\nBut the court held that the legitimacy of the inauguration ceremony was a matter for the prime minister and the king to decide.\n\n\u201cThe oath-taking concerns an action which reflects a \u2018specific relationship\u2019 between the cabinet and the king, and is considered a political issue under an act of government,\u201d the court said in its ruling. \u201cThe court thus cannot accept the petition for consideration.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s opinion is significant, for it has toppled elected governments in the past for violating the old Thai constitution, a constitution Mr. Prayuth rewrote and replaced in a 2016 national referendum.\n\nThe court said it was \u201cnot in its authority\u201d to rule on Mr. Prayuth\u2019s failure to recite the entire oath on July 16 before King Maha Vajiralongkorn in the elegant Dusit Palace.\n\nBut opposition leaders in the Thai national assembly say the court\u2019s washing of its hands in the controversy only opens the way for lawmakers to debate what to do.\n\n\u201cNow that the court has dismissed the petition, the debate can proceed without restrictions,\u201d said parliament\u2019s opposition chief whip Suthin Khlangsaeng on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe will be able to scrutinize the matter, and the prime minister now has no excuse to avoid\u201d answering questions, said Mr. Suthin, a member of the influential Pheu Thai (\u201cFor Thais\u201d) party.\n\nCompounding the confusion\n\nMr. Prayuth\u2019s inscrutable response has only compounded the confusion. He has insisted he will not quit over the botched oath-taking, but has cryptically suggested he made a mistake.\n\n\u201cI would like to apologize to all ministers,\u201d the prime minister said last month even after declining to comment on the growing controversy. \u201cI take sole responsibility,\u201d he said without elaborating during a speech describing his new policies to 800 government officials.\n\n\u201cIt will be settled soon, because I had no intention of doing it wrongly,\u201d Mr. Prayuth said a day earlier. \u201cLet us focus on the intention.\u201d\n\nHe has also warned opposition parties not to blow the oath controversy out of proportion.\n\nThe oath furor is all the more mysterious as it comes under a constitution Mr. Prayuth took a heavy hand in re-writing. The former military general seized power in a 2014 coup, tearing up the nation\u2019s previous constitution in the process.\n\nHe orchestrated the campaign to draft and approve a fresh charter as head of a military-dominated junta in Baghdad, strengthening the military\u2019s political domination but also maintaining Section 161, which required the new prime minister and Cabinet ministers to swear the oath to the king and vow to obey the constitution.\n\nMr. Prayuth has spent the past two months angrily rebuffing demands that he explain why he read out only part of his official vow, and recite the oath again in its complete form.\n\nIn Thailand, a new leader does not repeat the vow line-for-line as read out by a judge. Instead, the prime minister holds a large note card and reads the oath\u2019s short text while presenting his Cabinet to the king.\n\nSome opposition politicians, local media, academics and others publicly wondered if Mr. Prayuth does not want to obey the constitution after a nationwide parliamentary poll in March transformed him from head of a coup-installed junta to an elected leader.\n\nOthers speculated Mr. Prayuth made an embarrassing mistake, which he is even more embarrassed to correct.\n\n\u201cPrayuth Not Quitting for Botching Oath,\u201d said the headline of Khaosod English news media. \u201cOath Blunder\u201d and \u201cOath Gaffe,\u201d said the headlines in the Bangkok Post.\n\n\u201cIf he lets the oath-taking remain incomplete with an important part missing, future prime ministers may make up their own oaths without complying with the charter,\u201d parliamentarian Piyabutr Saengkanokkul, secretary-general of the opposition Future Forward Party.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
