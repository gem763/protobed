The bill has already passed the House.\n\n\u201cWe are not taking no for an answer. We are not going away,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is totally up to them, and it is on their shoulders. They can\u2019t escape that responsibility,\u201d Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer added.\n\nRenewed enthusiasm for gun-control measures comes after two back-to-back shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio killed 32 and left the nation shaken last month.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Background checks for gun sales, concealed-carry permits, and security spiked in August as congressional Democrats renewed their push for expanded gun control in the wake of several mass shootings.The National Instant Criminal Background Check System recorded a 15.5 percent uptick in background checks", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dKRYoZ2zijDMGIOabIXzyg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/slick_thumb/yahooNews-305870-1568158939495.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
