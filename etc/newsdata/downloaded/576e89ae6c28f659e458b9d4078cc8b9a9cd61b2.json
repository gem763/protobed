(Yes, it has to be yellow.) Only then is it legally valid. Clearly, a tattoo doesn\u2019t count. And yet, the patient had clearly gone through unusual effort to make his wishes known. The team members debated what to do, and while opinions differed, \u201cwe were all unanimous in our confusion,\u201d says Holt.\n\nThey decided to temporarily ignore the tattoo, at least until they could get advice. In the meantime, they gave the man basic treatments\u2014antibiotics, an IV drip, an oxygen mask to help him to breathe, and adrenaline for his plummeting blood pressure. But they avoided putting a tube down his throat and hooking him up to a ventilator. \u201cIt would have hurt to see a man with a DNR tattoo having a tracheal tube hanging out of him,\u201d Holt says.\n\nAll of this bought them enough time to get a hold of Ken Goodman, the codirector of the University of Miami\u2019s ethics programs. \u201cMy view was that someone does not go to the trouble of getting such a tattoo without forethought and mindfulness,\u201d Goodman says. \u201cAs unorthodox as it is, you do get a dramatic view of what this patient would want.\u201d\n\nBut tattoos are permanent and desires are fleeting, so the team pondered whether the words actually represented the man\u2019s desires. And there\u2019s good reason to be cautious. Back in 2012, Lori Cooper at the California Pacific Medical Center was caring for a (conscious) patient who was going to have a leg amputated, when she noticed a \u201cDNR\u201d tattoo on his chest. The man revealed that he got the tattoo after losing a poker bet many years ago, and actually, he would very much like to be resuscitated if the need arose. \u201cIt was suggested that he consider tattoo removal to circumvent future confusion about his code status,\u201d Cooper wrote. \u201cHe stated he did not think anyone would take his tattoo seriously and declined tattoo removal.\u201d\n\nHolt\u2019s unconscious patient couldn\u2019t weigh in, but social workers used his fingerprints to track down his identity. He had come from a nursing facility, and to everyone\u2019s immense relief, they had an official DNR form for him, printed on the requisite yellow paper. The man\u2019s condition deteriorated, and he passed away in the night.\n\nThe team did the right thing, says Nancy Berlinger from the Hastings Center. They provided basic care to buy time, called for an ethics consult, and got social workers involved. \u201cEven if the records weren\u2019t there, it was right to honor the patient\u2019s preferences,\u201d she says. \u201cPaper gets lost, and some people do not trust paper. This man may have been trying to safeguard against that, and [the tattoo] might have been the most reliable way to make his voice heard. It was right to take it seriously.\u201d\n\nBut Lauris Kaldjian, an ethicist at the University of Iowa, says he wouldn\u2019t have honored the tattoo without finding the official form. A DNR order isn\u2019t an end in itself, he says. It\u2019s a reflection of a patient\u2019s goals\u2014how they want their life to end. Patients are meant to discuss those goals with a physician so they can hear all the options available to them, and make an informed decision; the physician must then sign the order. \u201cThat\u2019s not meant to be a paternalistic move,\u201d Kaldjian says. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to give evidence that a rational discussion was had, and I don\u2019t think tattoo parlors are a place to have to have a code-status discussion.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019ve always joked about this, but holy crap, this man actually did it.\u201d", "authors": ["Ed Yong"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/12/nejmc1713344_f1/facebook.jpg?1522344107", "published_at": "2017-12-01"}
