The Munich-based former Siemens AG unit had previously backed a lower offer from private equity groups Bain Capital and Carlyle Group LP.\n\nThe show of support for AMS gives the Austrian sensor maker a boost in a months-long battle for Osram, which came into play after a series of profit warnings more than halved its share price over the course of a year. Bain and Carlyle are considering increasing their 3.4 billion euro offer, people familiar with the matter said last month, which could switch the initiative back their way.\n\nOsram said differences remain with ASM over \u201csome important strategic elements\u201d that require further discussion, though that may not be enough to appease unions and employee representatives, who make up half of Osram\u2019s supervisory board. They have questioned AMS\u2019s planned savings from the deal, saying they would lead to job losses and facility closures in Germany. IG Metall, which represents Osram workers, \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d the AMS deal, a spokeswoman said on Friday.\n\n\u201cOur commitments are the same if not better than that of Bain and Carlyle,\u201d AMS Chief Executive Officer Alexander Everke told reporters in Munich.\n\nOsram shares traded 0.5% higher at 37.70 euros per share as of 10:24 a.m. in Frankfurt, while AMS declined as much as 4.9% in Zurich.\n\nInvestor Support\n\nMeetings between AMS and its investors across Europe, the U.S. and Asia over the last two weeks revealed \u201cstrong support\u201d for its plan to buy Osram, AMS said in a separate statement on Monday. It reduced the minimum acceptance rate for its offer to 62.5% from 70%, though won\u2019t be able to count on Osram CEO Olaf Berlien, who will not tender his personal stock.\n\nAMS shareholders still need to approve a capital raise to finance the transaction that will increase debt, but that \u201cwill be reduced to where it was before the deal within two years,\u201d Everke said.\n\nThe bidding war began in July, when AMS offered to counter a bid from Bain and Carlyle. AMS\u2019s proposal was cleared last week by the country\u2019s financial watchdog, allowing offers to remain open until Oct. 1.\n\n(A previous version of this story corrected to say Osram recommended, not rejected, the offer by AMS.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Oliver Sachgau in Munich at osachgau@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anthony Palazzo at apalazzo@bloomberg.net, John Bowker, Andrew No\u00ebl\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Osram Licht AG recommended a 3.7 billion-euro ($4.1 billion) takeover bid from AMS AG on the basis of price, risking a backlash from labor groups concerned over potential job cuts that may come with the deal.The terms of AMS\u2019s 38.50 euro-a share proposal eclipse Osram\u2019s lingering concerns", "authors": ["Oliver Sachgau"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
