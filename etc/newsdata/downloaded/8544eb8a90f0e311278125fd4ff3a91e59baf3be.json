They held American flags as well as signs expressing support for free expression and criticizing the Chinese government. Two attendees held a large, gold banner that read, \u2018Hong Kong\u2019s fight is everyone\u2019s fight.\u2019 The rally was coordinated by two local groups: the Vietnamese Community of Houston and Vicinities and Texas for Hong Kong. The same coalition organized approximately 30 people on Thursday for the Rockets\u2019 home opener, and they sat behind the south basket and stood holding their signs during stoppages in play.\n\nOn October 4th, Morey posted a tweet in support of pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. Despite almost immediately deleting the tweet, China reacted harshly by canceling several TV and streaming broadcasts, and several other business deals with the NBA.\n\nHowever, while damage may have been done to the NBA\u2019s standing with communist China, in Hong Kong and in much of the the United States, Morey\u2019s tweet was well-received.\n\n\u201cMy reaction [to the Morey tweet] was, \u2018Great, someone is supporting and publicly speaking for Hong Kong,'\u201d said Chris Wong, a research scientist and Hong Kong native who helped organize the demonstrations at Toyota Center. \u201cBut the reaction from the Chinese government and the machinery in China was such an overreaction just for someone sending out a symbolic tweet. I was mad.\u201d\n\nLeBron James also found himself the target of protests. Fanny Wong, a CPA who immigrated to the United States from Macao in the 1970\u2019s, wore a shirt that read: \u201cStand with Hong Kong, Be Taller than LeBron, who kneels down for \u00a5\u00a5\u00a5 [the symbol for Chinese Yuan].\u201d\n\n\u201cI can understand that a lot of athletes, they have a lot of financial investment,\u201d Wong told ESPN. \u201cWhat I would appreciate is that they be honest about that. Just say, \u2018We have a lot of interests at stake there, and there are certain things we need to compromise.\u2019 I\u2019d respect that. They stood for justice somewhere else when there\u2019s no financial conflict of interest. But then where there is a conflict of financial interest, \u2018Oh, wait a minute. We don\u2019t understand.\u2019 To me, that\u2019s a lie. I\u2019d respect it more if they were honest about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs game time neared, the group began to chant, \u2018Stand for freedom, no censorship,\u2019 before breaking into staccato chants of \u2018Morey, Morey, Morey\u2019 and then \u2018NBA, NBA, NBA,\u2019 ESPN reports.\n\nThe Rockets beat the Pelicans 126-123.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "Roughly thirty-five demonstrators rallied outside of Toyota Center in Houston on Saturday night, to support the pro-democracy movement in", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AFP-Photo1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
