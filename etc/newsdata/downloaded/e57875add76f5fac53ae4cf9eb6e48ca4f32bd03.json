But it\u2019s a middling amount for one of the top-polling candidates in the Democratic primary and lags behind what Bernie Sanders raised by more than $10 million.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign announced his haul Thursday after the former vice president unexpectedly announced it during a fundraiser in Palo Alto, California. He has raised $36.7 million since entering the race in April.\n\nMore: Joe Biden answers Donald Trump during campaign event in Nevada: 'I'm not going anywhere'\n\nPete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, also bested Biden during the third fundraising quarter, announcing this week that he raised $19.1 million. California Sen. Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million. Elizabeth Warren is the only top-tier contender who has not yet announced her fundraising figures.\n\nWith Iowa's caucuses looming in February, a sense of urgency is growing among the candidates as the primary contest turns into a fierce battle for a limited pool of cash.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee, meanwhile, have a huge cash advantage. They announced Tuesday that they collectively raised $125 million for Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nThat has heightened Democratic anxiety that a protracted primary could hurt the party\u2019s chances of quickly picking a nominee and rallying the cash needed to fight Trump.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/03/joe-biden-fundraising-comes-behind-bernie-sanders-pete-buttigieg/3858737002/", "description": "The sum places him well ahead of many lower-tier candidates in the Democratic primary.", "authors": ["Brian Slodysko", "Associated Press", "Published P.M.
