It reminds me very much of our early days in China,\u201d NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum said in an interview.\n\n\u201cToday in China basketball is the number one sport. 300 million people play the game of basketball in China.\n\n\u201cIt is very reminiscent of the early days of the NBA in China. And I think that basketball has the same potential here in India.\u201d\n\nSince 2004, 17 NBA teams have played 26 games in Beijing, Guangzhou, Macao, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Taipei and LeBron James\u2019 Los Angeles Lakers will play a pair of exhibition games against the Brooklyn Nets in China this month.\n\nThe Lakers, 16-time champions, and Nets will play in Shanghai on Thursday followed by a game in Shenzhen on Oct. 12, extending the trend of NBA squads competing in China.\n\nAccording to the annual report on the teams\u2019 digital performance, the NBA franchises gained a cumulative 47 million new followers on Chinese social media platforms last season.\n\nThe popularity of Chinese basketball icon Yao Ming, who played nine seasons in the NBA with the Houston Rockets, opened the doors for the NBA in his native country but Indian players are yet to make a mark in the league.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the presence of Yao helped accelerate our interest in the game of basketball there,\u201d said Tatum, who is also the chief operating office of the NBA.\n\n\u201cAnd now even after Yao has stopped playing, that passion has been fueled in Chinese fans and they continue to follow the game in record numbers.\u201d\n\nBesides its academy, the league launched the Reliance Foundation Jr. NBA Program in 2013 to develop the game at the grassroots level in India and Tatum said the NBA was deeply invested in developing talent in the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not to put a time frame on it. There is no doubt that I think in the next five to 10 years we will see an everyday starter in the NBA from India and hopefully an all-star starter in that time frame,\u201d he said.\n\nIndia is set to overtake China and become the world\u2019s most populous country by 2022 and with its young population and economic growth prospects, the south Asian country is one of the most important markets for the NBA, Tatum said.\n\nMore than 3.1 million fans follow the NBA India Facebook page while nearly 100 million people watched the NBA games last year on its broadcast partner Sony Pictures Networks India.\n\nWhile regular-season NBA games are not yet a realistic possibility due to logistical issues, pre-season games might be a regular feature in India.\n\n\u201cSo for us we see all of that growing interest and the big macro factors around the country, we see that as a great time to continue to invest in India,\u201d Tatum said.\n\n\u201cI think depending on what we have seen so far, such a tremendous response and a very, very successful trip and experience for our players and the fans, I\u2019d hope there will be more and more pre-season games here.\u201d", "description": "Basketball can become as popular in India as it is in neighboring China and bringing pre-season games to Mumbai can prove a timely catalyst, a top NBA executive has told Reuters.", "authors": ["Sudipto Ganguly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437325396&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF94066", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
