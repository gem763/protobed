I mean, look at how things turned out between Jake Paul (his brother) and Tana Mongeau! Even though Jake and Tana's relationship was entirely fake (as in no marriage license), it garnered a flurry of media attention anyway. But before we knew all of that, everyone just had to assume it was true YouTuber love. And now, Logan is on the quest to find romance for himself\u2014and with Kendall Jenner no less.\n\nOn Jonathan Cheban's podcast, Foodgod: OMFG, Logan straight up asked Jonathan \"Do I have a chance with Kendall Jenner?\" which in all honesty is smart, because Jonathan is super close to the Kar-Jenners.\n\n\"I don't think so and you know why? I think you're too out there and Kendall is very low-key with the people she dates and they're low-key,\" Jonathan answered, trying to shoot Logan's hopes to the ground. \"If you did date Kendall, the next day you would skydive off the Empire State building. That wouldn't work for her.\"\n\nLogan, however, doesn't really want to give up on his celebrity crush. \"When you meet me in real life, I'm not the person you see on the Internet,\" Logan said. \"Maybe if I get her in a conversation, we'll see what happens,\" later adding, \"I'm just ready for the high-profile relationship.\" Well, uh...good luck with that!\n\nAs for Kendall, it's pretty obviously that she prefers to have a private relationship with whoever she's dating. \"I\u2019m in relationships for myself, for me and that other person, not for anybody else, so I don\u2019t find the need to be flexing it like that,\u201d she previously said on Zaza World Radio, so dating someone like Logan Paul doesn't exactly fit her brand.\n\nWell, Logan\u2014keep on dreaming! You know what they say: If you shoot for the moon, you'll end up somewhere among the stars, LOL.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Shooting for the stars, clearly!", "authors": ["Starr Bowenbank"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bAXFOLET4iAHZhs4gEsi0A--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/df7261d58532af49051440daf3463b72", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
