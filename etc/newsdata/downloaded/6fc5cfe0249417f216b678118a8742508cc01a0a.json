Danault's second goal of the game in the third gave Montreal a short-lived lead before goals by Hunt and Parise put Minnesota ahead for good.\n\nZucker opened the game with a first-period goal in the team's first game since the player included head coach Bruce Boudreau in a controversial quote, saying everyone on the team needed to be better. Zucker redirected a shot from the point on the power play at 8:57.\n\nAll three of Zucker's goals this season have come on the power play.\n\nThe finest of Kinkaid's saves on Sunday came when he stopped Zucker midway through the second period. As he fell to the ice, Kinkaid gloved a shot by Zucker that would have tied the game.\n\nPhillip Danault, left, celebrates a goal with teammates during the second period. (Hannah Foslien/Getty Images)\n\nMontreal scored twice in a 16-second span in the second period. Tatar evened the game with a power-play goal at the 2:50 mark. Dubnyk gave up a big rebound to Tatar, who buried it for his third goal of the year.\n\nThen Danault put Montreal up 2-1 after a turnover by Minnesota in its own zone. Danault banked the puck off Dubnyk's skate seconds after Tatar's equalizer.", "description": "TK", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5328468.1571615988!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/habs-wild-102019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
