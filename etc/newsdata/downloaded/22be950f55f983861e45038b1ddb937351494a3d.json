The Kaga was found 17,000 feet down in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, and the Akagi at a much shallower depth of 1,800 feet. The Petrel is owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.\n\nExpedition director Rob Kraft and Naval History and Heritage Command curator Frank Thompson said they found the Akagi after examining high-frequency sonar images on Sunday.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s sitting upright on her keel. We can see the bow. We can see the stern clearly,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cYou can see the gun emplacements on there. You can see that some of the flight deck is also torn up and missing, so you can actually look right into where the flight deck would be.\u201d\n\nBoth carriers were sunk by U.S. bombers from the USS Enterprise during the Battle of Midway in June 1942, six months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. About 2,000 Japanese and 200 Americans were killed in the historic fight.\n\nThe battle, which resulted in substantial losses for the Japanese navy, is considered one of the most influential of World War II. Japan\u2019s military launched the assault hoping that, like Pearl Harbor, it would devastate the United States\u2019 ability to make war. U.S. military cryptographers won a key advantage in the battle by intercepting Japanese communications that listed the date and time of the planned attack.\n\n\u201cThe Battle of Midway was an American intelligence breakthrough,\u201d Thompson told Maritime Executive. \u201cThe team that deciphered the Japanese fleet codes enabled Pacific Fleet commander [Chester W.] Nimitz to understand Japanese intentions and plan accordingly.\n\n\u201cThis was a true turning point in the war for the U.S. Navy.\u201d\n\nTwo other Japanese carriers that sank during the battle have yet to be found.", "description": "Expedition crews believe they have discovered two Japanese aircraft carriers that were sunk in the famed Battle of Midway.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/battle-of-midway-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
