Not a great neighborhood, but my first apartment wasn't in a great neighborhood, either.\n\nFiona has always been empathetic and kind. She donates her time at soup kitchens, fosters rescue animals, and will go the extra mile for friends and family.\n\nToday she sent out a family-and-friends group text saying she has discovered an encampment of homeless people living near her apartment. She sees them on her drive to and from work. She wants to help and has asked us to donate spare blankets, warm clothing, feminine hygiene products, \"durable\" non-cook foods (e.g., peanut butter, granola bars, crackers), and toiletries, and she will stop by and deliver them.\n\nThis is a wonderful idea but it seems risky, and I am conflicted. It seems to me like a bad move at this time in Fiona's life. She lives alone, and close to the encampment. Sometimes desperate people do desperate things. I would rather she tempered her generosity with practical safety, and let us donate to a homeless shelter in her name, rather than her hand-delivering items.\n\nHow should I reply?\n\n\u2014 Hard-Hearted\n\nHard-Hearted: Reply with a donation of spare blankets, warm clothing, feminine hygiene products, accessible foods and/or toiletries. She is going to be the person who does things like this no matter what, with or without your support; she\u2019ll do it next time even if you talk her out of it this time; and she\u2019s going to do her own accounting of risk vs. reward.\n\nI know you\u2019re worried. But I think you will feel better if you choose, consciously, to turn your face toward her light.\n\nCongratulations on raising this beautiful child.\n\nTo Hard-Hearted: I'm involved in homeless outreach. All of the things Fiona asked for are desperately needed by people experiencing homelessness, and what a wonderful thing she wants to do.\n\nIf you're scared, offer to go out with her or ask her to take a friend or two along. That is a basic safety step.\n\nAlso, trust your daughter that she won't give out her address. I assume she wouldn't to any stranger, and there is no reason to treat a person experiencing homelessness differently in that regard. We need more Fionas in the world.\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nTo Hard-Hearted: Your neighborhood homeless people are also part of your neighborhood and are eyes on the street, which is especially useful if you're a woman alone. I've had my neighborhood regulars help me when I was injured, warn me of unexpected road closures so I didn't waste time going the wrong way and step in when strange men on the street were harassing me. If anything, knowing them has made me safer.\n\n\u2014 Neighbor\n\nTo Hard-Hearted: We have our own \"Fiona,\" who is now 25. It takes practice to let your dearest treasure be an adult and make adult decisions that seem risky from the parental perspective. This is a great opportunity to practice letting go a little and being supportive. Hard but necessary.\n\n\u2014 Supportive", "description": "She\u2019s a grown woman, and her heart\u2019s in the right place.
