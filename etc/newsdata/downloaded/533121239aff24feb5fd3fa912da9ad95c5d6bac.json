As a staff full of gamers and game-lovers, we'll be serving up extra reviews, guides, interviews, and other stories all about gaming from August 19 to August 23.\n\nAny monitor can work for gaming, but a good gaming monitor will make your virtual exploits more polished. With their high refresh rates and adaptive sync, they can bring your games to a new level of fluidity. But since the market is flooded with confusingly-named choices, it can be tough to find the ones worth buying.\n\nSo for Ars Gaming Week, we set out to help. After spending the last three months researching dozens of gaming monitors and ultimately testing 14, we\u2019ve come up with a few recommendations that should suit players of all kinds, whether you\u2019re more into fast-paced online shooters or contemplative stories.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSome notes on testing\n\nLet's start with some info on our testing process. Our primary measurement tool for this guide was a Datacolor Spyder5Elite colorimeter and its accompanying software. This helped us evaluate color accuracy, peak brightness, contrast ratios, color gamut, luminance uniformity, color uniformity, and more with hard data instead of personal opinions. That said, there are spectrophotometers and other high-end equipment we did not have access to that can give more pinpoint readings. Our test results still get at the gist of each monitor\u2019s pros and cons\u2014if a panel has poor contrast or colors inaccurate enough to be a distraction, we\u2019ll know either way\u2014but this difference made us hesitant to harp on specific test results throughout this guide. Because we tested everything with the same tools and lighting conditions, though, each monitor was still evaluated against a consistent baseline.\n\nTo test motion handling and more gaming-specific features, we played games on PC, Xbox One, and PS4, making sure to play faster multiplayer shooters like Apex Legends and Overwatch as well as colorful single-player games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Tetris Effect. We also used a suite of tests from Blur Busters that helped us better gauge motion blur, response time, ghosting, and other motion qualities.\n\nOur favorite all-around gaming monitor: Gigabyte Aorus AD27QD\n\nJeff Dunn\n\nJeff Dunn\n\nJeff Dunn\n\nJeff Dunn\n\nJeff Dunn\n\nJeff Dunn\n\nJeff Dunn\n\nJeff Dunn\n\nJeff Dunn\n\nJeff Dunn\n\nBecause this is a guide to gaming monitors, we put greater emphasis than usual on motion smoothness, input lag, and support for variable refresh rate (VRR) tech like Nvidia\u2019s G-Sync and AMD\u2019s FreeSync, which dynamically adjust a panel\u2019s refresh rate to better avoid stuttering and screen tearing while playing a game. A high refresh rate, meanwhile, will be beneficial for both gaming PCs and next-gen consoles . We didn\u2019t put these traits too far ahead of picture quality and design, though, since most people will still spend plenty of time browsing the Web and doing work on their monitor. We\u2019re also speaking more to the box performance, since most monitor users tend to avoid messing with their picture settings heavily. (That said, picture quality will improve on all our picks post-calibration, so that\u2019s worth doing if you can.) And while 4K monitors have matured to the point of being worthwhile for non-gaming purposes, we aren\u2019t recommending any here: the in-game benefits of 4K aren\u2019t massively superior to 1440p in practice, and it requires major GPU power to push 4K at high refresh rates consistently.\n\nDifferent gaming setups have different needs, so it\u2019s hard to say one monitor will definitively work for everyone. But of the monitors we tested, our favorite was the Gigabyte Aorus AD27QD.\n\nThis is a 27-inch panel, which we think is the sweet spot between having enough space to not feel cramped and not overwhelming everything on your desk. It has a 2560x1440 resolution\u2014some competitive-minded gamers will justifiably say that a 1080p monitor makes it easier for more GPUs to push higher refresh rates, but not every game is so demanding. It\u2019s possible to turn down the resolution in many games to get a stabler frames per second (FPS), and the boost in crispness is immediately noticeable on a panel larger than 24 inches. Being able to fit more windows onscreen whenever you\u2019re not playing a game is a significant plus.\n\nThe AD27QD is technically an Innolux AAS (Azimuthal Anchoring Switch) panel, but the end result is effectively an IPS display. Like its fellow panel types TN and VA, IPS comes with its own set of strengths and weakness, which the AD27QD follows pretty closely. The monitor has wide viewing angles, so colors won\u2019t be heavily distorted when you aren\u2019t looking at the screen straight on. It has excellent color accuracy out of the box, with a DeltaE score below 2 in our testing. (In simple terms: any score above 3 means colors are inaccurate, anything below 2 has inaccuracies that are barely perceptible to viewers, and anything below 1 is practically perfect.) Its colors are largely uniform across the entirety of the display, and its peak brightness is higher than most IPS panels. It has a particularly generous color gamut, so it can display a wider-than-usual range of colors. And it supports an expanded 10-bit color depth for further boosting\u2014technically 8-bit + FRC, not native 10-bit, but the difference is minimal to most. You\u2019ll need a powerful GPU to push the latter, though, and it requires you stay at a 120Hz refresh rate to work.\n\nLike most IPS monitors, the AD27QD has so-so contrast. It\u2019s actually better than the majority of IPS panels we tested, so this isn\u2019t as severe of a trade-off, but in a vacuum it can\u2019t distinguish white and black tones as well as a good VA panel. Its black uniformity is poor, too, so largely black screens will look uneven and splotchy in spots. The AD27QD also suffers from a light \u201cIPS glow\u201d effect that causes the bottom corners of the screen to lose detail in darker surroundings. All of this means the monitor is best used in a lighted room instead of a dark one. (Though it\u2019s only decent at reflecting glare, so you don\u2019t want to put it directly in sunlight.) Gigabyte advertises HDR support and VESA DisplayHDR 400 certification, but since the monitor lacks local dimming, it doesn\u2019t have much meaningful benefit. All that said, while the AD27QD isn\u2019t a panel for professional photo work, it\u2019s better than most of its peers at making games look lively and balanced.\n\nIt also does well to keep things running smoothly. The AD27QD has a 144Hz refresh rate and supports AMD FreeSync over DisplayPort and HDMI. It has a VRR range of 48-144 Hz. If your game\u2019s frame rate dips below that, the monitor supports FreeSync\u2019s low frame rate compensation (LFC) tech. This makes it set the refresh rate to multiples of whatever frame rate it\u2019s at below the VRR range. If a game is running at 34fps, for example, FreeSync will double the frames it sends to the monitor and set the refresh rate to 68Hz to keep screen tearing and stuttering at a minimum.\n\nCrucially, all of this works with Nvidia graphics cards, not just AMD models. The AD27QD is one of the handful of FreeSync monitors that is officially certified as \u201cG-Sync Compatible\u201d by Nvidia. Several others work fine without that official title, but having it means the AD27QD has been tested and approved to work with GTX 10 series and RTX cards by the company making them. FreeSync has had some minor quirks with Nvidia cards before\u2014screen flickering between games, for instance\u2014and the G-Sync Compatible mode only works over DisplayPort. But the adaptive sync tech generally works as it should on the AD27QD, enabling itself automatically and snuffing out all tearing and flickering.\n\nThe rest of the AD27QD\u2019s motion performance is good. Response time is fast for an IPS panel with the monitor\u2019s \u201cSpeed\u201d overdrive setting enabled, with little noticeable motion blur and very low input lag. The AD27QD is not as smooth as a good TN panel, but given how dramatically better its picture quality is elsewhere, it\u2019s strong.\n\nThe one noteworthy issue here is overshoot, or inverse ghosting. In simple-ish terms, this is when a panel\u2019s overdrive causes a pixel to \u201covershoot\u201d its final color value and create a shadow-like effect around a moving object, in the opposite color of said object. The \u201cSpeed\u201d setting of the AD27QD causes a noticeable amount of this at lower refresh rates. So if you use the monitor with a PS4 or a PC game that isn\u2019t getting close to the full 144Hz, it\u2019s better to switch to the standard \u201cBalance\u201d overdrive mode. This will slow response times a little, but the image will look cleaner on the whole. If you can keep your game around 144Hz, overshoot on the \u201cSpeed\u201d setting is minor, so sensitive eyes should be able to enjoy faster-paced titles without compromise.\n\nThe design of the AD27QD is convenient and well-made. It\u2019s a breeze to put together, and its stand is thin, so it doesn\u2019t eat up a ton of room on your desk. Its small bezels make it accommodating to a second monitor, too. There\u2019s enough metal in the build for it to feel solidly built. We didn\u2019t do much with the faint RGB lighting on the back of the monitor, but it\u2019s there and customizable if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. The adjustability of the monitor is excellent, with a wide range to swivel and adjust height, as well as the ability to rotate the panel 180 degrees into a vertical orientation. The one-button toggle for accessing the on-screen display (OSD) is easy to use and reach, and that OSD is broken down in a way that\u2019s not overwhelming. The port selection is solid: one DisplayPort 1.2, two HDMI 2.0 ports, 2 USB 3.0 ports, mic and audio out 3.5mm jacks. There are no built-in speakers, sadly, but there is a unique \u201cactive noise cancellation\u201d feature that lessens ambient sounds when you\u2019re speaking through a connected microphone. This cuts out low-end noise fairly well, so it could come in handy if you\u2019re trying to chat with your squadmates in a noisy house.\n\nThere are a few other extras beyond that, but the gist is that the AD27QD is a great jack-of-all-trades gaming monitor. For less than $600, you get an ideal size and resolution, a useful design, good enough motion, effective FreeSync and G-Sync Compatible VRR, and color reproduction that plays well everywhere.\n\nThe good\n\nWell-built 1440p monitor with great colors, snappy motion, FreeSync, and official G-Sync Compatible certification.\n\nThe bad\n\nSome inverse ghosting noticeable at highest overdrive setting with lower refresh rates.", "description": "Including picks for 1440p, ultrawide, budget models, 240 Hz, and more.", "authors": ["Jeff Dunn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/LG_34GK950F_1-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
