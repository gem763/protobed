Bloomberg\n\n\"What you need is a strong brand and we think the brand has got the strength to expand into other areas,\" he said. \"But the plan is for it to be about food. We want to be the definitive food company.\"\n\nThe food platform has invested heavily in its Editions or \"dark kitchens\" \u2013 built specifically for online food deliveries \u2013 and recently launched its Restaurant Revival to help restaurants on food procurement and data to curate their menus.\n\nDeliveroo is the first platform to launch an $18.99 monthly subscription service for unlimited deliveries; orders outside of this service typically attract a $5 delivery fee. The platform said subscribers now accounted for about 25 per cent of their orders.\n\nCompany founder Will Shu was also recently in Australia meeting with major franchisors like McDonald's, which partners with UberEats, to argue the global food chains should not be signed exclusively to one platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"For consumers and for restaurants, it is healthy [that] there are a number of viable delivery partners,\" Mr McManus said.\n\n'We're at Everest base camp'\n\nThe new CEO uses the analogy of climbing Mount Everest to motivate his 170 local staff. \"This business and the wider category is at Everest base camp,\" Mr McManus said.\n\n\"Everest base camp is at 5,000 metres, which is twice the height of Australia's highest mountain, Mount Kosciuszko, so that is a significant achievement. But over the next few years, the analogy is we want to get to the top of Everest at almost 9,000 metres.\"\n\nThe former scientist, who worked in the pharmaceutical industry before moving into digital media and then energy, said there are far more parallels in the businesses than most people realise.\n\nWilliam Shu has been meeting the likes of McDonald's to argue they should not be exclusively tied to UberEats. Pat Scala\n\n\"One of the challenges in this business is to optimise so you have enough delivery riders available for peak times and ensuring their welfare, safety and what they earn but also having enough people for off-peak times, so managing between peak and off-peak,\" he said.\n\n\"That challenge is very different but intellectually similar to wholesale retail electricity,\" he said. \"Here we are trying to optimise consumer demand for food with restaurant supply and delivery riders.\"\n\nDeliveroo, like other gig economy businesses, is facing protests over wages. Former Deliveroo rider Jeremy Rhind is the latest to launch a case with the support of the Transport Workers Union.\n\n\"We're not tone-deaf to the political concerns and would like to work constructively with political and other stakeholders,\" he said. \"But the vast majority of riders value flexibility, on average earn above the minimum wage and we would like to provide them some of the benefits of being employees.\"", "description": "Deliveroo's new Australian CEO, Ed McManus, who starts in the role on Monday, has grand plans to expand the food delivery platform, as American juggernaut DoorDash shakes up the $2.6 billion food delivery market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2991%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_581%2C$y_115/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4831c820c8da0696672c3cc817b7e12cc0bc3b89", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
