Many feel justice was poorly served. However, a former prosecutor says that the verdict was to be expected.\n\nThe Four-Hour Verdict\n\nThe Tokyo District Court ruled former executives of TEPCO were not guilty of criminal negligence, in the only criminal prosecution to come out of the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan.\n\nThe cataclysm at the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant in March of 2011 resulted in over 100,000 people losing their homes, wide-spread radioactive pollution, injuries, and the deaths of patients who had to be evacuated. The disaster, on the scale of Chernobyl, raised alarms around the world about nuclear energy and atomic safety.\n\nThe disaster area has not been cleaned up entirely and is essentially a nuclear accident still in progress, requiring constant cooling. Radioactive water stored at the TEPCO facilities is likely to be dumped into the ocean next year\u2014probably after the Olympics.\n\nThe three former executives of TEPCO who were indicted on charges of professional negligence resulting in injury and death were: Tsunehisa Katsumata, 79, chairman of TEPCO at the time of the accident, and two former vice presidents\u2014Sakae Muto, 69, and Ichiro Takekuro, 73.\n\nThe trial centered on whether these three could be held criminally responsible for what the Japanese Parliament\u2019s Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission called \u201ca man-made disaster.\u201d\n\nHow the Earth Is Reclaiming Fukushima, the Ninth Ward, and Staten Island\n\nThe central issue at stake could be summarized as this: Did the TEPCO officials know about the possibility of a nuclear-meltdown-inducing tidal wave, when did they know, and what did they do\u2014or not do about it?\n\nTEPCO\u2019s six-reactor plant, located on the Pacific coast, was disabled after tsunamis triggered by the massive earthquake of March 11, 2011 flooded power supply facilities, which were unprotected, and crippled reactor cooling systems. Some reactors suffered fuel meltdowns, while hydrogen explosions damaged others.\n\nThe indictment blamed the three former executives for injuries to more than 10 people from hydrogen explosions at the plant, as well as the deaths of 44 patients forced to evacuate from nearby hospitals.\n\nAs early as 2002, TEPCO and the Japanese government were aware of a potentially disastrous earthquake and tidal wave causing a nuclear accident.\n\nThe prosecutors argued, and the court also acknowledged that several times between February 2008 and March 2009 the TEPCO executives were warned of the risk of a tidal wave 14 meters (45 feet) high or higher hitting the power plant and causing a potential nuclear disaster. On March 11, tidal waves between 11.5 and 15.5 meters (50 feet) did hit the power plant, knocking out the power grid and, yes, as predicted for years, triggering the nuclear disaster.\n\nThere were also independent reports that suggested the earthquake's tremors caused a nuclear meltdown in the 40-year-old Reactor One even before the waves hit, but those allegations were not considered by the court.\n\nThe verdict, which took several hours for the judges to finish reading out loud\u2014starting at 1:15 p.m. and ending around 4:30 p.m. with a short break\u2014concluded that while the TEPCO executives did receive several warnings of a tidal wave large enough to cause a nuclear accident, they were justified in taking no safety measures for a number of reasons:\n\n1) If they had taken the warnings seriously and tried to take countermeasures it would have required them to close the plant down temporarily, which was considered prohibitively expensive.\n\n2) There were questions as to how seriously to take the data about tsunamis.\n\n3) Even if the TEPCO executives had acted on the warnings, they probably wouldn\u2019t have completed safety countermeasures in time.\n\nIn reaching the decision, the court stated that tsunami forecast information was vague, and that the three could not have \u201crealistically\u201d foreseen a disaster on such a grand scale.", "description": "Christopher FurlongTOKYO\u2014Three executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) who ignored repeated warnings of a potential tidal wave that could result in a nuclear disaster, which did in fact take place, were found not guilty of criminal negligence resulting in death and injury by a Tokyo Court", "authors": ["Jake Adelstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/M08zWskH2H1YTpNLbm_1sg--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/c9f9e703d0868e1ce38ab44a44521d78", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
