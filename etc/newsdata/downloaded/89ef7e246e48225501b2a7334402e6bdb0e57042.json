While the bill currently only has Republican co-sponsors, the Wyoming lawmaker said she is discussing the measure with Democratic members and lawmakers in the upper chamber.\u201cWe\u2019ve been working very closely with the Senate, working very closely across the aisle as well, but it\u2019s very important to recognize the impact, in particular, that the Turks now are in a situation where we risk the resurgence of ISIS, where the Turks have gone in and we see evidence of atrocities being committed, and where our allies, the Kurds, frankly, are facing what looks like a betrayal from the United States that could have very negative consequences and impacts for us globally,\u201d she told reporters Wednesday.Cheney also took a swipe at Sen.(R-Ky.) for his position on the country\u2019s involvement in Northern Syria, arguing the United States plays a critical role in ensuring the region is stable.\"That is the right thing to do, we are the only ones who can do it and if we step away from that role, if we go down the path that\u2019s been suggested by Senator Paul and others, into isolationism then others will fill that void and we are going to face a possibility of living in a world where America\u2019s not setting the rules, but our adversaries \u2014 the Chinese, the Russians, the Iranians \u2014 are setting the rules and that is not a world anybody wants to live in,\u201d she continued at the press conference.\u201cSo it\u2019s very important that we make sure that we maintain America\u2019s global engagement and that we consider the costs of inaction, we consider the costs of having to go back into situations where we\u2019ve withdrawn from. We do not want to repeat the mistakes of the Obama era, which created the mess that we have inherited.\"The bill follows Sens.(R-S.C.) and(D-Md.) introducing a similar measure in the upper chamber earlier this month.", "description": "House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney unveiled legislation on Wednesday to place sanctions\u00a0on Turkey in the wake of Ankara\u2019s military operation targeting Kurdish forces in Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cheneyliz_101619gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
