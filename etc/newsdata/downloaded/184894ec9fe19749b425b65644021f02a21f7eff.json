Nine women and 26 children. All of European origin,\" said Fatiha Lakjaa, a grandmother of six Belgian children in Syria.\n\nHer son Nohredin and daughter Bouchera \u2013 together with their partners, Fatiha\u2019s son- and daughter-in-law \u2013 left for Syria in 2013.\n\nA year later, both men died.\n\nThey left behind their widows and Fatiha\u2019s six grandchildren, who I met in the camp of Ein Issa \u2013 just weeks before Turkey\u2019s military incursion forced the dismantlement of at least one of the detention facilities holding thousands of so-called Islamic State families.\n\n\u201cThe loss of a child is a scar that never goes away. It\u2019s a scar that is deeply rooted,\" Fatiha told me, bursting into tears.\n\n\"I don\u2019t want my daughter, my daughter-in-law and my grandchildren to die in the desert too. I cannot continue with this pain.\u201d\n\nFatiha is not alone. Across Europe, hundreds of families lost their children to a world of radical ideas and brutal acts. Now they are fighting to be reunited with those they believe are the biggest victims of the horrors inflicted by the Islamist group \u2013 the children.\n\n\u201cThe majority of these people are, in my view, victims. Of course, there\u2019s a small core of dangerous people. But if we frame them well with the judicial tools available, they will not be a threat. We must be a strong society. We need to settle our own problems,\" said Sarah, the sister of a Belgian national detained in north-east Syria.\n\nThe Belgian government repatriated six unaccompanied children from Syria in June this year, but an estimated 69 remain. Government agencies say those who have returned are doing well, thanks to a mechanism already in place in the country to protect all children in danger.\n\n\"Services of the state are called to evaluate the capacity to educate of the parents, grandparents, uncles or aunts who would be able to welcome the child here. During the time the investigation is conducted, the children are placed with specialised child psychiatric services for a month. This time in the hospital allows [us] to conduct multiple evaluations,\" explained Madeleine Guyot, an advisor to Belgium's General Delegate for the Rights of the Child.\n\nIt is unclear when, or if, Fatiha and other grandmothers like her in Europe will be able to hold their grandchildren again. But the families say they will not give up, despite the excruciating effects of what seems like an endless wait.", "description": "Sayfoellah, Shahied, Muthanna and Mujahied \u2013 seen in the video above \u2013 are missing after the detention camp in which they were being held in north-east Syria was forcibly evacuated, their grandmother has told Euronews.", "authors": ["Anelise Borges"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/24/32/1000x563_cmsv2_47876bd1-a484-540f-962d-dd14be561962-4262432.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
