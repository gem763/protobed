Just mention Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cFor news shows on MSNBC, CNN and other cable networks, nothing is more disgusting than the mention of what Hunter Biden actually was doing in Ukraine,\u201d law professor Jonathan Turley of George Washington University writes in The Hill.\n\n\u201cWhat is most remarkable about the paucity of coverage of Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings,\u201d he adds, \u201cis the conclusory mantra that, \u2018This has all been investigated.\u2019\u201d\n\nPETER SCHWEIZER: HUNTER BIDEN'S 'RADIO SILENCE' ON UKRAINE DEALING SONLY RAISES SUSPICIONS\n\nTurley, 58, a native of Chicago, cites examples of MSNBC\u2019s Nicolle Wallace cutting away from a speech by President Trump when he started to discuss the Bidens; NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd accusing Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., of trying to \u201cgaslight\u201d viewers by referencing the Bidens while answering a question about Ukraine; and CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett switching to a discussion of President Trump when Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., tries to discuss the Bidens.\n\nPressure directly from the Biden campaign may be at least partly to blame, Turley writes.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the Biden campaign has been remarkably open in demanding that news organizations stop airing interviews or publishing articles about the allegations,\u201d according to Turley. \u201cInstead of calling it \u2018fake news\u2019 (which is virtually copyrighted by Trump), the Biden campaign calls such coverage \u2018conspiracy theories.\u2019\u201d\n\nOne recent example Turley cites was when CNN reported that Biden campaign official Kate Bedingfield wrote to executive editor Dean Baquet of The New York Times, chastising the newspaper for running an article by \u201cClinton Cash\u201d author Peter Schweizer titled, \u201cWhat Hunter Biden Did Was Legal \u2013 That\u2019s the Problem.\u201d\n\nTurley also points to a Reuters report that said the Biden campaign tried to convince Facebook, Twitter and Google not to run a campaign ad for President Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe professor does not disparage the media for looking into the overseas business deals of the Trump family. But he says \u201cthere is no reason why the media cannot pursue allegations against both the Trumps and the Bidens.\u201d\n\nHis conclusion: Investigating the Bidens \u201cwould counter the narrative that there\u2019s \u2018nothing wrong\u2019 with Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings and that it\u2019s all a \u2018lie\u2019 that\u2019s best to ignore.\u201d", "description": "Want to watch a left-leaning TV journalist quickly change the subject?
