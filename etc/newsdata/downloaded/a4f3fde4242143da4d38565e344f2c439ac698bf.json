He is not a conventional \u2026 by society\u2019s so-called \u2018norms\u2019,\u201d said the lawyer Lawrence Greenspon. \u201cBut [Boyle] is a person who tells the truth, even if it\u2019s not to his own advantage.\u201d\n\nBoyle, 36, has pleaded not guilty to 19 charges of assault, sexual assault and unlawful confinement.\n\nWearing a caramel-coloured shirt with a red corduroy vest, Boyle sat in an Ottawa courtroom with his parents and sister, frequently taking notes on a white legal pad.\n\nCaitlan Coleman, and her mother Linda, participated in the proceedings through video link at the Canadian embassy in Washington DC.\n\nUS woman kidnapped in Afghanistan tells court how she escaped ex-husband Read more\n\nBoyle and Coleman, who married in 2011, were kidnapped during a trip to Afghanistan in 2012. The pair were later transferred to the control of the militant Haqqani network. The couple had three children while in captivity and in November 2017, the family was freed by Pakistani forces. After release, they moved to Ottawa, until Boyle was arrested on 31 December 2017.\n\nDuring closing arguments on Monday, Greenspon highlighted parts of Boyle\u2019s testimony which he admitted were damaging for the accused.\n\nBoyle admitted to criticizing his wife, fighting often and striking her once while the two were in captivity, said Greenspon.\n\n\u201cHe told the truth \u2026 where adopting a different path would have been much simpler,\u201d he said.\n\nGreenspon said that a list of demands from Boyle which Coleman had described (including instructions on her weight, and the frequency of sexual intercourse) was nothing more than a list of \u201cNew Year\u2019s resolutions\u201d.\n\nGreenspon also took aim at Coleman\u2019s testimony, suggesting it was \u201cneither credible nor reliable\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no eyewitness or physical evidence to corroborate any of the 19 charges [against Boyle],\u201d said Greenspon, suggesting the American had provided testimony that had only \u201cmild corroboration\u201d.\n\nBefore the two sides began closing arguments, the court heard about the erosion of the marriage between Coleman and Boyle as lawyers re-examined witnesses.\n\n\u201cI became very angry with Josh that he had brought us [to Afghanistan],\u201d Coleman told the court on Monday, saying the couple fought frequently.\n\nColeman also vigorously denied a suggestion from the defence that she traded chocolate with the guards for \u201cmock execution\u201d of Boyle. \u201cThat is absolutely not correct,\u201d she said.\n\nUnder examination by the crown, Coleman described feelings of inadequacy both in captivity and while the couple lived in Ottawa.\n\n\u201cI struggled with shame \u2026 he was telling me I wasn\u2019t a good enough wife. I felt like I couldn\u2019t possibly be the person he\u2019s always demanding,\u201d said.\n\nWhile much of the early trial focused on the allegations of sexual abuse towards Coleman, the defence has spent recent weeks unearthing documentation and testimony to suggest that the acts Coleman has accused Boyle of were consensual.\n\nThe trial, which began in March, has been plagued by delays \u2013 including while the court considered whether Coleman\u2019s sexual history should be admitted.\n\nDespite a judge\u2019s order not to speak publicly about the case, Coleman granted a number of interviews to Canadian and American media outlets, prompting a number of procedural tangents in the trial.\n\nThe prosecution will rest its case in the coming days. Boyle has opted for the trial to be overseen by a judge only.", "description": "In closing arguments, Joshua Boyle\u2019s defence attempted to smooth out the damaging parts of his testimony", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ab08a5760e7210afceaf9c61869a55a444b1b2b/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ceeed0687fb55aa40f4b7d4f24e33d0c", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
