Why support & finance filmmakers visions on one hand and then work to destroy the presentation of those films on the other??? https://t.co/T7QdYAQGHU \u2014 Brad Bird (@BradBirdA113) October 28, 2019 Report\n\nSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse co-director Peter Ramsey added: \"Does everything have to be designed for the laziest and most tasteless?\"\n\nActors who have complained include Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul, who said the feature amounted to \"completely taking control of everyone else's art and destroying it\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @aaronpaul_8 Stop. As the person talked about in this article I felt the need to speak out. There is NO WAY @netflix will move forward with this. That would mean they are completely taking control of everyone else\u2019s art and destroying it. Netflix is far better than that. Am I right Netflix?\ud83c\udfa5 https://t.co/fZDnYzvStN \u2014 Aaron Paul (@aaronpaul_8) October 28, 2019 Report\n\nNetflix vice-president Keela Robinson said in a statement: \"We regularly test new features that could help improve Netflix.\n\n\"This last test has generated a fair amount of feedback - both for and against. This is a mobile only test and gives people the ability to vary the speed at which they watch on phones or tablets...\n\n\"It's a feature that has long been available on DVD players - and has been frequently requested by our members. For example, people looking to rewatch their favourite scene or wanting to go slower because it's a foreign language title.\"\n\n'Efficiency is everything'\n\nThe function could also appeal to viewers with a backlog of box sets to binge on. In fact, some people have for a while been indulging in \"speed-watching\".\n\nGoogle Chrome has extensions that allow viewers to speed up Netflix content, while YouTube offers a variable speed feature, as does Apple for podcasts.\n\nThere's even an \"efficiency expert\" out there who advises watching at faster speeds to make the most of your viewing time.\n\n\"More jokes, more laughs, more drama, more suspense - same time,\" Michael Kirk, creator of the Efficiency is Everything website, writes. \"Efficiency: Like an assembly line, if we increase the speed of the line, we will see more completed.\n\n\"Same jokes, same plot, and at 10% faster - you won't notice a difference.\"\n\nNetflix's Keela Robinson said the company had \"been sensitive to creator concerns\", so hadn't included TVs in this test and had also put in an audio pitch adjustment feature.\n\n\"The company has no plans to roll any of these tests out in the short term,\" she added. \"And whether we introduce these features for everyone at some point will depend on the feedback we receive.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or at bbcnewsents.
