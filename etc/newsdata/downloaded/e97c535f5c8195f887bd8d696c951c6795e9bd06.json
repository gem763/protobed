(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nPresident Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke shortly after 9 a.m. on July 25. That call, which Trump later told Republican lawmakers had been prompted by a request from Energy Secretary Rick Perry, is now at the center of an impeachment inquiry in the House. A rough transcript of the call includes requests from Trump to Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a political opponent of Trump\u2019s, and to seek out evidence that could undermine an assessment that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016.\n\nThe call and those requests, though, didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. For months, Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani had been agitating for an investigation into Biden in particular. Text messages released Friday show how officials, including E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland and special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, discussed preparations for the call and then its aftermath.\n\nOn Tuesday, an interview conducted with Sondland on July 26 by an English-language Ukrainian television network resurfaced. It includes details that take on new resonance in light of what we now know about the Trump-Zelensky call and its genesis.\n\n\u201cI had a wonderful hour-long meeting with President Zelensky that followed on the heels of his telephone call yesterday with President Trump,\u201d Sondland told interviewer Kari Odermann. Asked whether he got a sense of what Trump and Zelensky talked about, Sondland said he had.\n\n\u201cI actually spoke with President Trump just a few minutes before he placed the call,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cAnd not only did the president call to congratulate President Zelensky but also to begin the collaboration of charting the pathway forward with the U.S.\u2019s support of Ukraine and a White House visit that\u2019s upcoming for President Zelensky.\u201d\n\nNBC News reported Tuesday that such a call would be typical for the Trump-Sondland relationship, as Sondland was \u201cpart of a small cadre of ambassadors who enjoy direct and frequent access to Trump.\u201d\n\nThe timing is important. As far as descriptors go, \u201ca few minutes\u201d isn\u2019t terribly clear. But a call between Sondland and Trump shortly before the Trump-Zelensky call could be significant, given one of those newly released text messages.\n\nAt 8:36 a.m., Volker texted a Zelensky aide named Andrey Yermak.\n\n\u201cHeard from White House,\u201d Volker wrote. \u201cAssuming President [Zelensky] convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck!\u201d\n\nThat \u201cget to the bottom\u201d likely refers to the theory underpinning Trump\u2019s interest in investigating Biden: a debunked claim that Biden had pressured Ukraine to fire its general prosecutor to shield his own son. The Volker text message offered an explicit quid pro quo \u2014 Zelensky says he\u2019ll investigate 2016 and he\u2019ll get a White House visit. Sondland\u2019s reference to speaking to Trump around the same time hints at the possibility of a more direct line from Volker\u2019s offer through Sondland to Trump.\n\nIn the July 26 interview, Sondland emphasized his close working relationship with Volker and Perry on Ukraine issues. He described the three as the \u201cthree amigos\u201d and said that they had \u201cbeen tasked with sort of overseeing the Ukraine-U.S. relationship between our contacts at the highest levels of the U.S. government and now the highest levels of the Ukrainian government.\u201d The text messages released Friday largely involve Volker, Sondland and the U.S. charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Ukraine, William B. \u201cBill\u201d Taylor.\n\nA complaint filed by an intelligence community whistleblower mentions meetings between Sondland, Volker and Ukrainian officials on July 26.\n\n\u201cBased on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me by various U.S. officials,\u201d it reads, \u201cAmbassadors Volker and Sondland reportedly provided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the President had made of Mr. Zelensky.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve known for some time that the prospect of a White House visit was a powerful lure for the Ukrainian president. After Sondland told the interviewer that a possible visit was in the works, she reacted positively.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great news because we\u2019re all curious about this,\u201d she said. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a date set for this. Sometime in late summer? Tell us more about that, please.\u201d\n\nSondland doesn\u2019t put a hard date on a visit, saying that he hoped it would happen within weeks, not months. The text messages indicate that Yermak, the Zelensky aide, proposed late September. By early August, though, the messages shift to another effort to leverage the meeting: Predicating a White House visit on a public statement from Ukraine about opening those investigations.\n\nOdermann then mentioned to Sondland that a Ukrainian readout of the Trump-Zelensky call included a mention of fighting corruption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic that President Zelensky and his team are taking it seriously,\u201d Sondland replied. He noted that conversations about corruption predated his tenure as ambassador but that nothing had happened.\n\n\u201cPresident Zelensky was very mindful of that,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s really one of the things he ran on. And we\u2019re very confident that he takes these changes seriously. He\u2019s going to implement them in record time. And the U.S. is going to be right there with him supporting him.\u201d\n\nBy late August, Yermak had reached out to Volker with concerns about the administration\u2019s withholding aid that had been scheduled to go to Ukraine. A few days later, Taylor texted Sondland to raise concerns about linking that aid to Trump\u2019s desired investigations. Sondland suggested they talk by phone \u2014 a shift which, as Sondland likely knew, would eliminate a written record of the conversation.\n\nThe next day, Taylor \u2014 not one of the three amigos \u2014 raised the concern again.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone,\u201d he wrote at 12:47 a.m. on Sept. 9, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nFive hours later, Sondland replied.\n\n\u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign[.] I suggest we stop the back and forth by text \u2026\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported last week that Sondland spoke with Trump before sending that message.", "description": "In an interview the day after the call, E.U.
