He has seen some slippage in polls and more recently been the target of a campaign of unsubstantiated allegations by Trump concerning his son Hunter\u2019s business activities in Ukraine and China.\n\nBut that issue was only briefly touched upon \u2013 and by Biden himself, who tried to keep the focus instead on Trump and the impeachment inquiry the president faces as a result of a whistleblower complaint that he pressured Ukraine to investigate him and Hunter Biden.\n\nBiden\u2019s team had worked furiously in advance of the debate to defuse the issue, and his rivals showed little appetite for making it an issue.\n\nFor once, Biden was not at the center of the evening, reflecting the evolving nature of the Democratic race.\n\n\n\n\n\nNO LEFT TURN?\n\nWarren\u2019s advocacy for a universal government-run healthcare based on the Medicare plan for seniors, which could cost trillions of dollars, as well as for free public universities and a tax on the wealthy, has sparked concerns among some Democrats that her platform is politically unrealistic and could alienate independent and moderate voters if she emerges as the party\u2019s nominee.\n\nHer challengers have accused her of being evasive about whether middle-class taxes would have to be raised to pay for her healthcare plan.\n\nAt the debate, Buttigieg accused Warren of wanting \u201cinfinite partisan combat\u201d that would continue to divide the country.\n\nAfterward, Buttigieg, who raised the third-most amount of money among the candidates in the third quarter of the year, told CNN he felt it was important to take Warren on.\n\n\u201cI think people really need to understand the difference in policy and the difference in vision,\u201d he said.\n\nThe first Democratic nominating contest in Iowa is less than four months away, adding an urgency to the jabs by Buttigieg and Klobuchar, among others, who have struggled to amass support.\n\n\u201cI think there was a real conversation tonight about approach,\u201d said Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist in South Carolina who advised Hillary Clinton's two presidential campaigns. \u201cThere was an elevated effort to highlight the pragmatic versus the progressive.\u201d\n\nAmid the attacks, Warren stayed firm and vigorously defended her agenda. She ended up with the most screen time of all the candidates.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d she asked at one point, \u201cdoes everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\u201d", "description": "The barrage of questions fired at Elizabeth Warren at Tuesday\u2019s debate in Ohio underscored her new front-runner status in the Democratic presidential race, but also lingering concern within the party over whether the progressive senator can defeat President Donald Trump next year.  2020 election but", "authors": ["James Oliphant"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x_RuaxKPS4Ll2I8.lW6Nzg--~B/aD0yNzE7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/adcffff01fb08523f5f1ea9620c4fae7", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
