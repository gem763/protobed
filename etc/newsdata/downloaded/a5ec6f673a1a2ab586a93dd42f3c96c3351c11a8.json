There\u2019s only ever been one coup in American history \u2014 the Wilmington Race Riot of 1898, when a group of white supremacists overthrew the local government and killed dozens of black residents.\n\nIn this case, an impeachment inquiry is not illegal, nor is it sudden. (It\u2019s a constitutional process that requires several steps, including a vote and trial by both the House and Senate.) Given the current U.S. Senate makeup, the actual removal of Trump from office is unlikely. And as our friends at Splinter put it, an actual coup involves a lot less red tape.\n\nHas Trump used the term before?\n\nIn February, Trump first used the term to quote Sean Hannity of Fox News; that month, Hannity had railed against former FBI Director Andrew McCabe for questioning Trump\u2019s connection to Russia. In a tweet using Hannity\u2019s language, Trump referred to McCabe\u2019s actions as a \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\nIn April, Trump used the term again during an actual interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News regarding Russia\u2019s influence on the 2016 election. \u201cThis was an attempted overthrow of the United States government,\u201d he told Hannity. \u201c... I think it\u2019s far bigger than Watergate.\u201d (Politifact determined that since the Mueller investigation didn\u2019t cross legal boundaries, it wasn\u2019t a coup attempt.)\n\nAccording to Newsweek, Trump has used coup in at least five other instances, either as quotes from conservative outlets or about his alleged ties to Russia (or both).\n\nWhat exactly is Trump\u2019s goal through the use of the term?\n\nJudging by his tweets, he\u2019s trying to argue the illegality of the impeachment inquiry (though nothing about it is illegal thus far). If he believes a coup is an attempt at taking his power, he\u2019d be right, but he\u2019s either misinformed or knowingly gaslighting his followers by defining an impeachment process \u2014 set by the U.S. Constitution \u2014 as an illegal act against the president.\n\nThe Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone\u2019s time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016, 223-306. Get a better candidate this time, you\u2019ll need it! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nOn Thursday, Trump continued his series of tweets with an attack on Democrats and referring to ongoing impeachment proceedings as \u201cbullshit.\u201d", "description": "On Wednesday, facing mounting pressure regarding an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats, U.S. President Trump tweeted that the inquiry was in fact a \u201ccoup.\u201d  \u201cAs I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a coup...\u201d he wrote. \u201c......", "authors": ["Chris Jager", "David Murphy"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/l/2017/01/Trump.jpg"}
