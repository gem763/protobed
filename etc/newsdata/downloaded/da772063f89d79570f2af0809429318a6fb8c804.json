Inside the embassy, employees heard this message over the loudspeaker: \u201cAn explosion caused by a rocket has occurred on compound.\u201d\n\nAbout an hour later the all-clear was given, with no injuries reported.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Afghan officials or those with the NATO mission, which is also nearby.\n\nIt was the first major attack in the Afghan capital since President Donald Trump abruptly called off U.S.-Taliban talks over the weekend, on the brink of an apparent deal to end America\u2019s longest war.\n\nTwo Taliban car bombs shook Kabul last week, killing several civilians and two members of the NATO mission. Trump has cited the death of a U.S. service member in one of those blasts as the reason why he now calls the U.S.-Taliban talks \u201cdead.\u201d\n\nThe 9/11 anniversary is a sensitive day in Afghanistan\u2019s capital and one on which attacks have occurred. A U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan shortly after the 2001 attack toppled the Taliban, who had harbored Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaida leader and attacks mastermind.\n\nIn the nearly 18 years of fighting since then, the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan soared to 100,000 and dropped dramatically after bin Laden was killed in neighboring Pakistan in 2011.\n\nNow about 14,000 U.S. troops remain and Trump has called it \u201cridiculous\u201d that they are still in Afghanistan after so long and so many billions of dollars spent.\n\nIt is not clear whether the U.S.-Taliban talks will resume.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A rocket exploded at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan just minutes into Wednesday, the anniversary of the 9/11 attack on the United States.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Cara Anna"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/Afghanistan_33029.jpg-c5c4d_c0-343-2794-1972_s1770x1032.jpg?9517426a98c41498005dffce742e9734319c5c11", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
