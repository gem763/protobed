In a series of technical blog posts, the company\u2019s Project Zero team outlined a number of vulnerabilities in Apple\u2019s iOS operating system. These vulnerabilities could, in certain cases, allow hackers to install software on a user\u2019s device that gave hackers access to, well, pretty much everything.\n\nSimply visiting certain websites was enough to open a backdoor into an iPhone. Decrypted messages, photos, real-time location, and so on \u2014 all were accessible via the malware that Google discovered and could be remotely uploaded from the device to a server elsewhere.\n\nGoogle notified Apple about the security holes, and they were patched in February. In a rare move, Apple also publicly commented on Google\u2019s blog posts, claiming that they mischaracterized the vulnerabilities, and the intent of the hackers. The statement reads:\n\nFirst, the sophisticated attack was narrowly focused, not a broad-based exploit of iPhones \u201cen masse\u201d as described. The attack affected fewer than a dozen websites that focus on content related to the Uighur community \u2026\n\nGoogle\u2019s post, issued six months after iOS patches were released, creates the false impression of \u201cmass exploitation\u201d to \u201cmonitor the private activities of entire populations in real time,\u201d stoking fear among all iPhone users that their devices had been compromised. This was never the case.\n\nSo there are a couple of things happening here. There\u2019s Apple obliquely acknowledging that the attacks were, as previously reported, likely carried out by the Chinese government in service of its ongoing persecution of the Uighur Muslim community. (Apple, like every major tech company, sees China as a lucrative market and is obviously trying to stay on the government\u2019s good side.) There\u2019s also Apple denying that the attacks were widespread and affected countless individuals.\n\nIt\u2019s possible \u2014 probable even \u2014 that Apple is telling the truth to the best of its understanding. Even if you believe that, however, the mere existence of these gigantic security holes calls into doubt pretty much every claim Apple has made about the iPhone\u2019s supposedly industry-leading and often-praised security measures. In today\u2019s statement, Apple brags, \u201ciOS security is unmatched because we take end-to-end responsibility for the security of our hardware and software.\u201d By most accounts, this is true, and yet we now have very concerning evidence of hackers who can subvert that end-to-end process. It\u2019s not just who is affected or the number of people affected that matters in this story, it\u2019s the fact that these iOS vulnerabilities existed at all.", "description": "The company issued a rare response to disclosures Google made last week, which outlined how hackers could steal sensitive data from an iOS device.", "authors": ["Brian Feldman"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/06/06-iphone.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
