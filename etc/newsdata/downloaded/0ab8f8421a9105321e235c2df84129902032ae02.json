Or the circumstances of building an early lead, losing it and then rallying once more in the fourth quarter.\n\nWhatever the reason, Seattle received a performance from Wilson that\u2019ll be hard to top.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the best, I think,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nWilson\u2019s 5-yard touchdown pass to Chris Carson on fourth-and-goal with 2:28 gave Seattle the lead, and the Seahawks held on for a 30-29 win over the Rams on Thursday night when Greg Zuerlein\u2019s 44-yard field goal with 11 seconds left missed wide right.\n\nSeattle earned a needed win against its NFC West foe after losing six of the past eight to the Rams. And while there were contributions from plenty of others, Wilson orchestrated a memorable night.\n\nWhether it was his throws from the pocket or when he was forced to improvise, Wilson was at his best. It was one stunning play after another from Seattle\u2019s star, continuing the best start to a season in his career.\n\nEven his opponents were left in awe.\n\n\u201cRussell Wilson is playing out of his mind right now,\u201d Rams safety Eric Weddle said.\n\nWilson was 17 of 23 for 268 and four touchdowns, and rushed for another 32 yards. He had touchdown passes of 13 yards to Tyler Lockett and 40 yards to DK Metcalf in the first half. He threw a 10-yarder to David Moore in the third quarter and he had a final answer after the Rams\u2019 had taken a 29-24 lead.\n\nWilson led Seattle 60 yards in 12 plays, helped during the drive by a roughing-the-passer call on Clay Matthews. After stalling inside the 10, Seattle faced fourth down at the 5. Wilson scrambled as he had all night, buying enough time to find Carson open in the corner of the end zone.\n\nThe running back scared nearly all of the 69,000 in attendance by juggling the pass before gaining control. Carson said he lost the pass in the stadium lights, which led to the juggle.\n\n\u201cI thought Russell played one of the best games I\u2019ve ever seen him play,\u201d Seattle coach Pete Carroll said.\n\nSeattle appeared to wrap up the victory when Tedric Thompson made a juggling interception of Jared Goff\u2019s pass while lying on the turf with 2:08 left. But the Rams forced Seattle to punt and took possession at their own 7 with 1:38 left.\n\nIn just seven plays, Goff had the Rams to the Seattle 30 after a 28-yard strike to Gerald Everett. The Rams stalled and a 9-yard pass to Everett on third-down set up Zuerlein\u2019s attempt. The snap was good, but the kick stayed just to the right.\n\nZuerlein had hit three field goals earlier in the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one kick. He\u2019s made a lot of big kicks for us. He\u2019s going to continue to make a lot of big kicks for us,\u201d Rams coach Sean McVay said.\n\nGoff finished 29 of 49 for 395 yards and one touchdown just days after throwing for a career-high 517 yards and tying an NFL record with 45 completions in a loss to Tampa Bay. Everett had seven catches for 136 yards, and Cooper Kupp had nine grabs for 118 yards and a TD.\n\n\u201cWe had some things that didn\u2019t go our way where we didn\u2019t finish drives but we were moving the ball really well,\u201d Goff said.\n\nCarson finished with 118 yards rushing on 27 carries. The touchdown was his only reception.\n\n\u201cEveryone kept their composure. Everyone was so poised and stayed in the moment,\u201d Seattle offensive lineman Duane Brown said. \u201cWe were always very optimistic and had all the faith in the world and big time players stepped up for us.\u201d\n\nLOCKETT\u2019S CATCH\n\nLockett\u2019s toe-tapping TD catch in the first quarter was as improbable as it gets. According to NFL statistics , the catch had a 6.3% catch probability, the most improbable completion of the past two seasons.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any more on time or on the money with his footwork there,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nGURLEY\u2019S MISTAKE\n\nTodd Gurley was a featured part of the Rams\u2019 offense early and finished with 51 yards on 15 carries, but the run game vanished during most of the second half.\n\n\u201cI thought he had some really good, hard-earned yards against a really good defensive front,\u201d McVay said.\n\nGurley also fumbled for the first time since Week 3 of last season. The fumble was ripped out by Jadeveon Clowney, who also recovered the ball. It was Gurley\u2019s first fumble in 338 offensive touches. He had gained 1,915 yards from scrimmage and 20 touchdowns between his two fumbles.\n\nKEY CATCH\n\nBrandin Cooks had just one reception but it was a big one. Cooks pulled in a 29-yard catch from Goff on third-and-8 from the Rams 27 early in the fourth quarter as he was being covered tightly by Shaquill Griffin.\n\nCooks was being evaluated for a concussion after the play and did not return. Carroll challenged there should have been offensive pass interference, but the call on the field stood. The catch led to Zuerlein\u2019s field goal that gave the Rams a 29-24 lead.\n\nINJURIES\n\nD.J. Fluker suffered a hamstring injury in the first quarter. He was replaced at right guard by Jamarco Jones, who typically is a backup tackle, but was forced to play guard with normal backup Ethan Pocic out because of a back injury.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nRams: Los Angeles stays in the NFC West, hosting San Francisco on Sunday, Oct. 13.\n\nSeahawks: Seattle is at Cleveland on Sunday, Oct. 13.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For all the other times when Seattle\u2019s Russell Wilson was the best player on the field and made highlight plays, this was different.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/rams_seahawks_football_02492_c0-83-2000-1249_s1770x1032.jpg?dc2de1c8909ff8deb251977349395aa0414518db", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
