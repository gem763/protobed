United Nations investigators last month tallied proceeds from all reported operations, including those carried out by other North Korean hacking groups, at $2 billion in recent years. Some thefts likely aren\u2019t reported to authorities for fear of embarrassment and exposure, a senior U.S. official said.\n\nNorth Korean officials didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment but historically have denied accusations of engaging in malicious cyber activity.\n\nTreasury said it also has been working with the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, as well as with the U.S. military\u2019s Cyber Command in recent months to disclose malware samples to private industry. Last week, under its North Korean malicious cyberactivity rubric \u201cHidden Cobra,\u201d the administration issued a public alert about a new version of malware dubbed \u201cELECTRICFISH\u201d that burrows into victims\u2019 computers to steal data.\n\nSenior administration and industry officials say that many reported, but not publicly disclosed, attacks on banks and other companies bear hallmarks of North Korean involvement.\n\n\u201cThough these operations may fund the hackers themselves, their sheer scale suggests that they are a financial lifeline for a regime that has long depended on illicit activities to fund itself,\u201d said John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis at the U.S. cybersecurity company FireEye Inc.\n\nCyber Command ranks North Korea\u2019s capabilities along with China, Russia and Iran as top strategic threats to U.S. national security.\n\nUnderscoring the geopolitical leverage its hacking abilities give Pyongyang, industry experts say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \u2019s willingness to at least talk about denuclearization over the past year may be from a belief that the country\u2019s cyber arsenal can partially supplant its weapons as a threat to other nations.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s hackers are carefully selected at an early age by the military and secret services and given specialized training.

Cyber-enabled heists also have become an essential source of revenue keeping the regime in power and insulating the economy from the global sanctions meant to force Pyongyang into giving up its weapons of mass destruction, U.S. and U.N. officials say.\n\nIn addition, North Korea\u2019s cyberattacks generate income in ways that are harder to trace than many of its other illicit activities, U.N. officials said in a report last month. The U.N. is investigating at least 35 reported North Korean cyberattacks across five continents targeting banks, cryptocurrency exchanges and mining companies.\n\nThe Trump administration previously has blamed the Lazarus Group for the WannaCry worm, which was unleashed in 2017, infecting more than 300,000 computers in more than 150 countries, crippling banks, hospitals and other companies. The Justice Department last year charged a North Korean operative, Park Jin Hyok, and unnamed co-conspirators, tying them to the WannaCry work, the 2014 hack on Sony Pictures and the $81 million stolen from Bangladesh\u2019s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2016.\n\nIt was only a typo in the Bangladesh heist that prevented the hackers from stealing $851 million they planned to transfer, officials say.\n\nSince the beginning of 2019 alone, North Korean agents have attempted five major cyber-thefts world-wide, including a successful $49 million heist from an institution in Kuwait, according to the U.N.\n\nU.N. investigators and members of a North Korean defectors group in South Korea say the North\u2019s hackers are carefully selected and groomed at an early age by the military and secret services and given specialized training.\n\nNorth Korean cyber collectives often use a variety of different schemes for revenue generation, as well as lay the groundwork for future hacks, according to experts on North Korea and cybersecurity.\n\nU.S. intelligence, security companies and North Korea watchers say that while they believe many of the freelance operations are largely for revenue-generation purposes, they also represent a major threat because of their infiltration of Western security systems.\n\nThey do so by working as software programmers who contract their services through freelance platforms, concealing that they are North Korean agents.\n\nMany companies rely on the freelance software platforms where \u201cthere\u2019s no vetting process or validation to ensure you\u2019re not working with sanctioned entities,\u201d said a top official at a private technology company that sells its products to the U.S. government and other Western allies.\n\nWrite to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com and Dustin Volz at dustin.volz@wsj.com", "description": "New U.S. sanctions against North Korean hackers and revelations about North Korean malware show how Pyongyang\u2019s cyber operations have become a crucial revenue stream and a security threat that soon could rival its weapons program, U.S. and industry officials say.", "authors": ["Ian Talley", "Dustin Volz", "Ian.Talley Wsj.Com", "Dustin.Volz Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107242/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
