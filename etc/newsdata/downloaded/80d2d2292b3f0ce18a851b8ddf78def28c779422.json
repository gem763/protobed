If the haze persists, and visibility is poor, things will be even harder.\n\n\"It's not just a safety consideration for the drivers,\" meteorology expert Professor Koh Tieh Yong of the Singapore University of Social Sciences told the BBC.\n\n\"It's also about whether they can do their best. As they are going very fast, they have to look far ahead. So for the drivers, visibility would be a bigger factor than for the spectators.\n\n\"It would affect their performance even before it affects their safety.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Even without the haze, the Singapore night race is a tough one\n\nThe temperature in Singapore often exceeds 30C (86F) and drivers have to endure about 50C in the cockpit.\n\nAdd to that a sweat-inducing 80% humidity, and you can imagine why the race is dubbed the Singapore Sauna.\n\n\"If you're going to have a race where the performances of your drivers are all compromised and they can not perform as normal, then what is the point of having the race?\" Mr Koh said.\n\n\"Are they really competing to the best of the their abilities - or is it just a lucky one who drove through a patch of clearer air and won?\"\n\nIf visibility gets very bad, the race could even be called off. But Singapore has experienced haze during previous F1 races without any cancellations.\n\nWhat do the organisers say?\n\nSo far, the race is set to go ahead - but the country is aware the situation is not ideal.\n\nDuring the race weekend, city authorities and race organisers will monitor haze levels and \"respond accordingly\" Jean Ng, executive director with the Singapore Tourism Board, told the BBC.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Lewis Hamilton has won four times previously in Singapore and will seek to add a fifth triumph to that\n\nFor now, that means spectators will be able to buy protective N95 masks at the merchandise and information booths and there will be assistance for anyone who is unwell.\n\nSingapore - with a population of less than 6 million - reportedly has a national stockpile of 16 million disposable masks.\n\nBut the F1 weekend is about much more than just the race - there's an abundance of activities and open air concerts that might also be affected.\n\nThis year's line-up includes Swedish House Mafia, Muse, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fatboy Slim.\n\nAnd while Ms Ng confirmed that both race and entertainment events are on track she advised tourists \"to exercise extra caution\".\n\nHow bad is the air quality?\n\nIt has been \"unhealthy\" for much of the week, according to Singapore's National Environment Agency (NEA), which monitors air quality and releases updates. There is even a haze website and a haze tracker.\n\nThe air is measured in PSI (Pollutants Standards Index). Up to 100, air quality is considered \"moderate\". From 100 - 200 is \"unhealthy\".\n\nLevels between 201 to 300 are \"very unhealthy\" and anything above that is classified as \"hazardous\". At its worst, in 2013, the city's PSI levels reached around 400.\n\nIn the days leading up to the race, levels were mostly above \"unhealthy\". On Thursday morning, the figure reached 131.\n\nThe NEA advises healthy people to reduce \"strenuous outdoor activity\", while children, elderly and the sick should minimise or avoid any such activity.\n\nShould levels get higher, people will be advised to remain indoors and minimise all time spent outdoors.\n\nBut - even though F1 fans and drivers may be uncomfortable - the situation is far worse in neighbouring Malaysia and especially Indonesia, where haze levels are significantly higher.\n\nIt's there where the fires are started, usually by farmers clearing land. Schools are closed and children, elderly, and the sick are particularly at risk.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'Like breathing in a barbecue': What it's like living in the haze\n\nWhat do the fans say?\n\nThe Singapore Grand Prix draws fans from across the globe, and many are already in the city.\n\n\"I'm not worried about the haze,\" Nuno Gomes from Portugal told the BBC. \"It's quite hot but it's going to be a fantastic weekend. The haze won't bother us.\"\n\nImage caption Bruce and Anna-Marie Harrison from New Zealand say they'll still make the most of it\n\n\"It hurts your eyes and you can taste it,\" said Anna-Marie Harrison from New Zealand. \"It's got a really bad taste to it.\n\n\"But the night racing is cooler, it has a great atmosphere and it's not far from New Zealand, so we definitely wouldn't have changed our plans. It might still blow away!\"\n\n\"You just have to deal with it,\" her husband Bruce agrees. \"You can't turn around and get your money back - so you just carry on and make the most of it. That's life.\"\n\nLike the Harrisons, the F1 organisers are hoping a favourable wind may lessen the haze's impact.\n\n\"The haze situation is highly changeable,\" a spokeswoman said. \"Not only from day to day, but from hour to hour.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Lucy Martin.", "description": "F1 returns to Singapore this weekend - just as the city sees its worst air quality in three years.", "authors": ["Andreas Illmer", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3CBA/production/_108864551_aa79a8e9-3adc-4c57-af70-e2e21681f573.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
