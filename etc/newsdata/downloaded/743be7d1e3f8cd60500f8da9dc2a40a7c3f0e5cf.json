At both the Heritage Foundation and on Fox Business Network, Vice President Mike Pence went on the offensive to rebuke the New York Times and Democrats for repackaging \u201cdiscredited allegations\u201d all over again. \u201cThe New York Times should be ashamed,\u201d Pence told Maria Bartiromo at around the 3-minute mark in this interview. \u201cAnyone responsible for leaving out that kind of a material fact,\u201d Pence continued, \u201cis an act of journalistic malpractice.\u201d\n\nWhat Democrats did in response was even worse, and \u201cnothing short of an attack on our independent judiciary,\u201d Pence insisted:\n\nPence reiterated the argument at the Heritage Foundation later in the day, a little more briefly:\n\nWe\u2019re making historic progress, strengthening the constitutional foundation of our courts through the appointments this President has made and will continue to make. But Democrats and their allies in the media are obviously getting desperate. After dominating our courts for more than a generation, leading Democrats today are now openly calling for packing the Court. And this week, they\u2019ve even taken to smearing a sitting justice on the Supreme Court of the United States with discredited allegations. The calls by Democrat candidates for president to remove Justice Kavanaugh from the Court are a disgrace and nothing short of an attack on our independent judiciary. Justice Brett Kavanaugh is a good and decent man, he is a principled jurist and a credit to the highest court in the land, and these attacks on Justice Kavanaugh must stop.\n\nThat\u2019s a significant warning shot from Pence to Democrats, who might have lost ground in the Senate last year because of the glaring unfairness of the attacks on Kavanaugh. They\u2019re already backpedaling away from the precipice to which their presidential primary candidates dragged them last weekend after the Times\u2019 journalistic malpractice first made its appearance. Pence and Republicans will not limit the blame for the renewed and rehashed smear to the mainstream media, but rather will make sure to blame the Democrats who started this in the first place.\n\nPeggy Noonan writes today that this will \u201cnever stop\u201d in part because it is an attack on an independent judiciary from progressives who have grown used to having it in their back pocket. However, it\u2019s also because progressives love street theater and melodramatic villains:\n\nHere are the reasons, in no certain order, that the accusations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh will never stop and his foes on the progressive left never let up. Because progressives have to prove they were right to advance the sexual-assault accusations of Christine Blasey Ford. They lost that battle; Justice Kavanaugh sits on the court. They won\u2019t stop the assault until they can prove they were right to launch it. \u2026 Because the crazier parts of the progressive left increasingly see politics as public theater, with heroes and villains, cheers and hisses from the audience, and costumes, such as outfits from \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d Because modern politics is, for the lonely and strange on all sides, entertainment and diversion. And one\u2019s people must be entertained.\n\nUnfortunately, this is all too true, which explains some of the antics in presidential primaries current and past as well. The upside of that is that it makes the attacks on Kavanaugh less meaningful in a political sense; the underlying unseriousness of this impulse makes the attack and the attackers much less credible.\n\nCarrie Severino, the co-author of Justice on Trial, made similar points in an interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s Martha MacCallum. The media\u2019s complaints about the \u201cfake news\u201d label would be much better considered if they stopped running uncorroborated gossip as news in the first place.", "description": "\"Journalistic malpractice,\" or \"politics as public theater\"?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pence-kavanaugh.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
