There is no apparent White House read out of what was discussed between the two world leaders, but foreign press reports said it was congratulatory.\n\nThe call has been the subject of intense rumors and fascination for days, as more information has been made public about the pressure that Trump exerted on Zelensky to look into largely discredited allegations of corruption involving former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Now the call is of keen interest to Democrats on Capitol Hill who last month launched an investigation into President Trump and Giuliani and their overtures to Ukraine about Biden, a congressional aide told The Daily Beast. A source on the House Intelligence Committee, which is involved in the investigation, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday that officials were \u201caware of this call\u201d and \u201cobviously following up on it.\u201d\n\nCongressional Democrats may not encounter much resistance as they look into the April 21st call. In a press conference Wednesday at the Intercontinental Hotel in New York, Trump said he would release the transcript of his first discussion with the Ukrainian president.\n\n\u201cI can save you a lot of time, they were all perfect,\u201d Trump said, referring to his calls with Zelensky.\n\nShould Trump follow through on that promise, it would mark the second case of him revealing details of his previously private discussions with Zelensky. Earlier on Wednesday, the White House released a detailed memorandum of a July 25th call between the two leaders, in which it was revealed that Trump asked Zelensky to look into the Biden allegations and to touch base with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and the Attorney General, Bill Barr, on the matter.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s role has been of particular interest to House Democrats. The Daily Beast first reported that lawmakers were preparing an investigation into Giuliani\u2019s activities in Ukraine, among which involved efforts to dig up dirt on Biden. Then, last month, the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees launched an official investigation into President Trump and Giuliani, saying they would look into whether Giuliani\u2019s communications with Ukraine threatened U.S. foreign policy interests. The committees also said they would probe Trump\u2019s temporary decision to withhold aid from Ukraine.\n\nThose investigations have now been accelerated with the announcement of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday that the party would begin formal impeachment proceedings.", "description": "And now, the president has said he\u2019d be fine with the details of the call being released.", "authors": ["Sam Stein", "Erin Banco", "Politics Editor", "National Security Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569446657/190925-stein-trump-call-tease_rh5at2", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
