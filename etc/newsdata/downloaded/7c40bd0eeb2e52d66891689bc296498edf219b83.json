Analysts were considering the implications of a potential Fortescue bid to develop Blocks 1 and 2 of the Simandou deposit in Guinea.\n\n\"Fortescue's bid is likely to provide long-term positioning, rather than near-term development given the early stage of the project and our view of a surplus iron ore market in the medium term. Further, if a significant cash outlay is made, investors could focus on impact to near-term payout and leverage,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said.\n\nSydney Airport rallied 1.2 per cent to $8.24 after Macquarie lifted its stance on the airport operator to a \"buy\" from \"neutral\" and raised its price target to $8.77 from $8.53, while welcoming discussions with airline Qantas over a fourth terminal.\n\nBaby Bunting dropped 5.9 per cent to $3.50, It said sales growth had eased in recent weeks and tax cuts and record low interest rates had had little effect on demand, but confirmed its earnings guidance for fiscal 2020 after a \"solid start\".", "description": "Australian shares rose for a second straight session, with heavyweight banks and miners helping pull the market higher.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1902%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e7ade4faa3ad373accbdb3d64d9ba3051134f3a8", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
