(\u201cGowest\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX-VENTURE: GWA) announced today that it has completed its settlement with PGB Timmins Holdings LP (\u201dPGB\u201d) in accordance with the minutes of settlement (the \u201cMinutes of Settlement\u201d) previously entered into between the parties. The material terms and conditions of the Minutes of Settlement are described in the Company\u2019s August 19, 2019 press release. Pursuant to the Minutes of Settlement, Gowest has paid to PGB the final required cash payment of US$7.5 million. The parties are now fully and finally released in respect of any and all claims and other matters arising in respect of the Pre-Paid Forward Gold Purchase Agreement (the \u201cPPF Agreement\u201d), dated as of December 16, 2016, entered into between PGB and Gowest.\n\n\n\nNew Credit Agreement\n\nIn connection with the completion of the settlement with PGB, Gowest has entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), dated as of October 16, 2019, with Greenwater Investment Hong Kong Limited (\u201cGreenwater\u201d), pursuant to which Greenwater advanced US$7.0 million to Gowest. The proceeds advanced under the Credit Agreement were used by Gowest, together with cash on hand, to fund the final cash payment obligation owed to PGB under the Minutes of Settlement. The Credit Agreement amends and restates the PPF Agreement, which was assigned to Greenwater (together with all security granted in favour of PGB under the PPF Agreement), as part of the settlement with PGB.\n\nPursuant to the Credit Agreement, the obligations thereunder are to be repaid in 33 equal consecutive monthly payments of blended principal and interest, each such payment totalling US$376,080, commencing as of May 2021. No payments of principal or interest are required to be paid by Gowest under the Credit Agreement until May 2021. All payments of principal and interest under the Credit Agreement are payable in cash and the Company has no future gold sale or delivery obligations under the Credit Agreement.\n\nSubject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company has the ability to prepay the obligations under the Credit Agreement at anytime prior to November 1, 2020. Further, at the option of the Company and subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the payment obligations under the Credit Agreement may be postponed for a period of up to six months such that the first payment would not be due until November 2021.\n\nThe obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first lien (subject to permitted liens) over all of the Company\u2019s properties and assets, other than certain excluded properties or assets specified in the Credit Agreement. The representations and warranties, covenants, events of default, and other terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement are generally consistent with the prior PPF Agreement, but modified as required to reflect the change in structure of the transaction to a loan made by way of a single advance and payable in cash.\n\nRedstone Mill Term Sheet\n\nThe Company also announced today that it has entered into a binding term sheet (the \u201cTerm Sheet\u201d) with Northern Sun Mining Corp. (\u201cNorthern Sun\u201d) with respect to the processing at Northern Sun\u2019s Redstone Mill in Timmins, Ontario of up to 30,000 tonnes of ore developed from Gowest\u2019s Advanced Exploration Bulk Sample program (see Gowest news release dated May 25, 2017) at the Company\u2019s 100% owned Bradshaw Gold Deposit (\u201cBradshaw\u201d). Upon entering the Term Sheet, Gowest has terminated the agreement entered into on October 30, 2018 with QMX Gold Corporation to process material from Bradshaw at its Aurbel Mill located in Val d\u2019Or, Quebec.\n\nPursuant to the Term Sheet, which expires September 30, 2020, Gowest is responsible for certain care and maintenance costs of the Redstone Mill, in the form of a standby fee of CDN$200,000 per month (which may be reduced to CDN$150,000 in certain circumstances). Gowest shall further be responsible for any capital costs to be incurred by Northern Sun in keeping with prudent practices for the processing the Bulk Sample ore. In respect of any month in which Gowest ore is being processed, the standby fee shall not be payable and Gowest will instead be responsible for payment of the actual operating costs of the Redstone Mill relating to the processing of such ore.\n\nThe commencement of processing the Bulk Sample is subject to Northern Sun obtaining requisite governmental consents and approvals. Northern Sun has undertaken to diligently and expeditiously seek to obtain, using commercially reasonable efforts, all required governmental consents and approvals, including environmental approvals, necessary for the processing of the Bulk Sample ore pursuant to the Term Sheet.\n\nNorthern Sun and Gowest have further agreed under the Term Sheet to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and execute a long-term custom milling agreement of not less than five years on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nGowest President & CEO, Greg Romain said, \u201cWe are pleased to have the PGB settlement behind us so that we can return our attention to developing Bradshaw. With the recent new private Chinese ownership of Northern Sun, Gowest can now look forward to processing material from Bradshaw at the Redstone Mill, the mill which we believe is best suited for our needs. We look forward to working with and continuing to advance our relationship with the new owners of Northern Sun.\u201d\n\nAbout Gowest\n\nGowest is a Canadian gold exploration and development company focused on the delineation and development of its 100% owned Bradshaw Gold Deposit (Bradshaw), on the Frankfield Property, part of the Company\u2019s North Timmins Gold Project (NTGP).
