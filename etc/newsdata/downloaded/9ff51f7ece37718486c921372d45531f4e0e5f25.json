On the upside, factory output improved and retail sales held up, but slowing investment growth remained a concern.\n\nPolicy makers appear to be allowing the world\u2019s second-largest economy to drift lower as they seek to clean up the financial system and curb excessive credit growth while they fight a confidence-sapping trade war with U.S. President Donald Trump. With a drop off in exports to the U.S. expected to continue as long as tariffs remain, the economy is likely to keep struggling as deflationary pressures hit company profits.\n\nEven with the slowdown, year to date growth of 6.2% suggests the government can hit its target of an expansion of 6% to 6.5% for 2019. Until now, officials have focused on limited, targeted measures such as reserve-ratio cuts and credit support, wary of expanding the nation\u2019s already heavy debt load. A meeting of the Communist Part\u2019s top leadership due in the coming days may present an opportunity to review stimulus settings.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s economy is grappling with both external and internal headwinds,\u201d said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC Holdings Plc in Hong Kong. \u201cExports started to contract of late amid wobbly global demand and rising tariffs in the U.S. Despite some stabilization in retail sales and industrial production in September, overall demand continues to soften, reflecting still relatively tight credit conditions.\u201d\n\nFurther Details from the Report:\n\nFactory output rose 5.8% in September, retail sales expanded 7.8%, while investment gained 5.4% in the first nine monthsInfrastructure investment growth picked up to 4.5% in the nine months to SeptemberThe contribution of net exports to GDP growth picked up to 19.6% in the 9 months through September. That\u2019s not necessarily an indication of economic strength though, as it was likely led by a pullback in importsConsumption\u2019s contribution increased to 60.5% from 55.3%; Investment\u2019s contribution slowed to 19.8% from 25.9%The surveyed jobless rate remained at 5.2%\n\nStocks pared earlier gains after the data, with the Hang Seng slipping 0.1% and the Shanghai Composite falling 0.6%. The offshore yuan was largely flat at 7.0791 per dollar.\n\nAs China slows, it is buying less from the rest of the world, pushing its trade surplus higher and dragging on global economic growth. That\u2019s having a knock-on effect on trade partners, from developed economies like Germany to commodity suppliers.\n\nGlobal policy makers including People\u2019s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang are meeting in Washington this week for the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meetings. The IMF set the tone for the gathering, making its fifth-straight cut to its forecast for 2019 global growth, which is on pace for the slowest expansion in a decade.\n\nThe long-term slowdown underlines the challenge for companies doing business in China now, where high sales growth had once been a given.\n\nFrench distiller Pernod Ricard SA said growth in China slowed to 6% in the latest three months, less than one-quarter of the year-earlier rate. Nestle SA said sales in the country were flat for the first nine months, while Unilever said business there \u201cslowed a little\u201d in the latest period.\n\nWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say..\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s 3Q GDP growth, while avoiding falling below 6% for now, was in line with our view that the consensus forecast appeared optimistic. September industrial production growth was unexpectedly strong, but a further deceleration in investment growth underscores the challenges of using infrastructure spending to support growth.\u201d\n\nChang Shu and David Qu, Bloomberg Economics\n\nFor the full note click here\n\nInvestors are looking for further confirmation of a detente between the U.S. and China on trade, as signs emerge that an agreement struck between negotiators in Washington this month and due to be signed by President Xi Jinping and Trump in November isn\u2019t water-tight.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Commerce Thursday signaled that Beijing is still pushing for the removal of all tariffs imposed by the U.S. since the trade war began -- a concession that\u2019s not currently on the table.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- China continued its grind to more moderate growth in the third quarter as investment slowed, providing little upside for a global economy flirting with its first recession since 2009.Gross domestic product rose 6% in the July-September period from a year ago, the slowest pace since the", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JO2VCks1MtJwdfDbnGLtSQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/a7c3d52360c458f4e37f47b504b6fdc1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
