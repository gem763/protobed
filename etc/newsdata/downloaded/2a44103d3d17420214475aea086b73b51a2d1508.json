It\u2019s why I\u2019ve always made it a priority \u2014 from my 2008 campaign until now,\" Obama tweeted Monday. \"And it\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to announce @allontheline\u2019s in-person training initiative, Redistricting U.\"\n\nRepublicans, though, have accused Democrats of making it sound like they want fairness \u2014 when in reality they are hoping to place their party in a better position.\n\n\u201cIf anyone tells you that @EricHolder is \u2018fighting against gerrymandering\u2019 and for \u2018fair maps,\u2019 just look at the form his organization filed with the IRS,\u201d former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker tweeted last week. \u201cThe truth: their mission is to \u2018FAVORABLY POSITION DEMOCRATS FOR THE REDISTRICTING PROCESS.\u2019\u201d\n\n\"Redistricting U\" was created in February after Obama merged his Organizing for Action group with former Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s National Redistricting Action Fund.\n\nAccording to \"All on the Line's\" website, \"Redistricting U\" will be \u201csending dedicated trainers to cities across the country to train volunteers, give them the tools to impact the redistricting process in their state, hear from them on how to best make change in their communities, and empower them to be leaders in the movement for fair maps.\u201d\n\n2020 HOPEFULS DEFEND THEIR OBAMA-ERA CRITICISMS\n\nThe organization is focused on impacting the redrawing of congressional districts, which will take place in 2021 following the collection of data in the 2020 census. They warn against \u201crigged electoral maps drawn with surgical precision by politicians to preserve their party\u2019s political power and silence the will of the people.\u201d\n\nPartisan gerrymandering was a hot topic in the spring, when the Supreme Court declined to weigh in on the issue, determining in a ruling in two cases that the judiciary should not get involved because it is a political issue best left to lawmakers.\n\nOne of the Supreme Court cases, Benisek v. Lamone, involved North Carolina, where Republicans had benefited from gerrymandering. \"All on the Line\" identified North Carolina as one of 10 \u201cpriority states,\u201d along with Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n\nOBAMAS PLACED AN OFFER ON 'MEGA-EXPENSIVE' ESTATE IN MARTHA'S VINEYARD\n\nNot on that list is Maryland, where Democrats had been accused of unfairly drawing district maps at the expense of Republicans in the Supreme Court\u2019s other partisan gerrymandering case, Rucho v. Common Cause.\n\nSince leaving office in January 2017, Obama has largely stayed out of the political limelight, though he has occasionally weighed in on political issues, like gun control. He has been known to enjoy the perks of his post-presidency: it was reported last week that the Obamas placed an offer on a 29-acre estate in Martha's Vineyard that had been listed at nearly $15 million.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe 44th president also recently made headlines in relation to the 2020 Democratic race in a recent New York Times report that revealed he may have tried to talk former Vice President Joe Biden out of seeking the presidency. Obama has not endorsed Biden in the race.\n\n\"You don\u2019t have to do this, Joe, you really don\u2019t,\" Obama reportedly told Biden in early 2019. Biden had been leading the Democratic pack in primary polls, but lately has been sharing the lead with Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.", "description": "Former\u00a0President Barack Obama is back in the political arena, announcing a new initiative to combat partisan gerrymandering -- though Republicans say the efforts are really about helping Democrats.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/AP18300043944234-e1541186319563.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
