Cummings said that the committee\u2019s interest in these topics will inform its review of legislative proposals.\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit challenging the subpoena, arguing that it lacks a legitimate legislative purpose. A federal district court judge ruled in favor of the Oversight and Reform Committee, and Trump appealed.\n\nIn the appeals court's majority ruling, the judges said that the Oversight panel was engaged in a \"legitimate legislative investigation\" when it issued the subpoena and that the subpoena seeks information on a subject that could be a focus of legislation.\n\n\"In sum, we detect no inherent constitutional flaw in laws requiring Presidents to publicly disclose certain financial information,\" the majority wrote. \"And that is enough.\"\n\nThe majority opinion was written by Judge David Tatel, who was appointed by former President Clinton.\n\nJudge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, dissented. She argued that the majority was wrong to rule that the Oversight and Reform Committee can issue this subpoena for legislative purposes, since the committee is seeking the information to investigate presidential wrongdoing, which is a function of Congress's impeachment powers, not its legislative powers.\n\n\"The majority breaks new ground when it determines Congress is investigating allegations of illegal conduct against the President, yet nonetheless upholds the subpoena as part of the legislative power,\" she wrote.\n\nBut the majority opinion also argued that the dissent \"cites nothing in the Constitution or case law\u2014and there is nothing\u2014that compels Congress to abandon its legislative role at the first scent of potential illegality and confine itself exclusively to the impeachment process.\"\n\nThe fight over the Oversight Committee's subpoena is one of several legal battles involving Trump's efforts to keep his financial information private.\n\nIn one of the other cases, Trump is challenging a subpoena New York prosecutors issued to Mazars for his financial records as well as his tax returns. A federal district court dismissed the lawsuit on Monday, and Trump has appealed.\n\nUpdated at 1:03 p.m.", "description": "A federal appeals court on Friday ruled against President Trump in his attempt to quash a subpoena for his financial records from House Democrats.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_100419as13_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
