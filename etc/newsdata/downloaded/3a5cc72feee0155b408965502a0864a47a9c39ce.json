She posed as a migrant and photographed in several formats including a smartphone, 35mm film and a GoPro. Poole has continued documenting Marta and Liset\u2019s new lives in the United States in the three years since she made the journey with them.\n\nMigration is one of the critical issues of our times, but the stories told are often hyperdramatized, oversimplified and rarely personal or intimate. \u201cLa paloma y la ley\u201d upends these superficial narratives with one of the most comprehensive accounts of migration ever published. The book renders the journey in all its danger, complexity and humanity.
