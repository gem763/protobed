However, he said it was important that the counsel was not made up entirely of \u201cyes men\u201d.\n\nA friendly business environment was more important to businesses than the council.\n\nDludlu also called on the minister to exercise the powers conferred on her by the act to publish guidelines for state institutions to help advance small businesses, and to consult with them about the possible impact of legislation on the sector.\n\nHowever, Johannes Wessels, the director of the Enterprise Observatory of SA, said that a friendly business environment was more important to businesses than the council.\n\nHe said this would ideally entail effective crime prevention, access to municipalities through staff who answer phones and emails, rapid issuing of tax clearance certificates for the transfer of property and a more flexible regulatory framework, as well as the protection of intellectual and other property.\n\nWessels said that if the council wanted to make a contribution to economic growth, it could campaign for statistical research to form the basis for policy formulation.\n\nThere are many myths regarding small businesses, such as that they create the most work, but there is no data to back up these claims.\n\nThe council will consist of at least seven members, but not more than 15 members. The minister will personally appoint only three.\n\nThe members of the council must have appropriate experience and will serve for a term of three years, which may be renewed for a further three years.\n\nThe department did not answer Rapport\u2019s questions, including those regarding the process that would be followed to appoint the remaining members, by the time of going to print.", "description": "Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, who was appointed as the minister of small business development in May, is appointing the long-awaited national small business council so that it can be fully functional by November 1.", "authors": ["Antoinette Slabbert"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9237/95a3763fab6f4651b8fed60b1d822d6b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
