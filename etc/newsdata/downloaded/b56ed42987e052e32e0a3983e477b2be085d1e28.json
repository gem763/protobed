As the vape industry has noted, the partial legalization of marijuana appears to have only strengthened the black market for illegal pot vapes. These so-called \u201cstreet vapes\u201d and their vaporized liquids are wholly unregulated. \u201cIf you\u2019re don\u2019t want to die or end up in a hospital, stop vaping illegal THC oils immediately,\u201d the head of the American Vaping Association agreed.\n\nThe wide variety of potentially dangerous concoctions available has nothing to do with mainstream vapes, and so far there\u2019s no evidence that victims got into trouble smoking typical vaping products.\n\nThat\u2019s important because of how huge a positive difference mainstream nicotine vaping products\u2014which have been federally regulated since 2017\u2013have made in the lives of adult smokers. Simply by eliminating the smoke of tobacco-based cigarettes from their lives, nicotine vapers have wiped out a massive and conclusively documented threat to their lives.\n\nRelated Articles California is still No. 1\u2026.in poverty\n\nCharter schools act more like private schools: Letters\n\nAn envious colleague eyes Duncan Hunter\u2019s tainted cash\n\nYour tax dollars are being used for perpetual war and human carnage\n\nStatues need statute of limitations: Doug McIntyre As the American Cancer Society notes, \u201ce-cigarette use is likely to be significantly less harmful for adults than smoking regular cigarettes,\u201d given that \u201ce-cigarettes do not contain or burn tobacco \u2014 a process that produces an estimated 7,000 chemicals, including at least 70 chemicals that cause cancer.\u201d\n\nA reasonable response to the vape scare would do three things: first, proceed with the current investigation; second, impose clear and enforceable regulations on all kinds of vape cartridges and liquids; and, third, do more to prevent underage vaping without overbroad bans that penalize responsible adult vapers making the switch from cigarettes.\n\nThat means rejecting the hysteria against all forms of vaping, which activists are using to mobilize sweeping bans against the whole technology.\n\nThe bottom line is that officials should not ignore how well-regulated vaping has dramatically reduced sickness and death from cigarette smoking. As alarming as today\u2019s health scare is, a puritanical approach to vapes is very unlikely to serve the public interest.", "description": "", "authors": ["The Editorial Board", "Opinion Section Staff Are Independent Of The News-Gathering Side Of Our Organization.
