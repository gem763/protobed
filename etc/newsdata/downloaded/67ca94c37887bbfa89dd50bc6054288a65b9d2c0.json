Other US troops in the region were still in position for now, the official said.\n\n191007034354242\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) warned that Turkish invasion will overturn the victory over the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) armed group.\n\nGraham said that if the reports are true and the plan goes forward he will introduce a \"Senate resolution opposing and asking for a reversal of this decision\". He predicted such a resolution will have \"strong bipartisan support\".\n\nHe warned that a US withdrawal in the region \"ensures [an] ISIS comeback\", \"forces Kurds to align with Assad and Iran\", \"destroys Turkey's relationship with U.S. Congress\" and \"will be a stain on America's honor for abandoning the Kurds\".\n\nAlso, if this plan goes forward will introduce Senate resolution opposing and asking for reversal of this decision. Expect it will receive strong bipartisan support. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\nSpeaking to Fox News later on Monday, Graham said: \"This impulsive decision by the president has undone all the gains we've made, thrown the region into further chaos.\"\n\n'Stab in the back'\n\nThe withdrawal marks a major shift in US policy and effectively abandons an American ally in the battle against ISIL, which took over swathes of Syria before being defeated a year ago.\n\n191005091819370\n\nUS President Donald Trump on Monday defended his administration's decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria, saying it was too costly to keep supporting its allies.\n\n\"The Kurds fought with us but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so. They have been fighting Turkey for decades,\" Trump said in a series of tweets. \"Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out.\"\n\nBut SDF spokesman Kino Gabriel said that there \"were assurances from the United States of America that it would not allow any Turkish military operations against the region.\"\n\nKino added that the US decision \"was a surprise and we can say that it is a stab in the back for the SDF\".\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday his army was ready to launch operations against Kurdish fighters in Syria at any moment following the US announcement.\n\n190829170037420\n\nTurkey previously warned it would carry out military operations east of the Euphrates River, but put its plans on hold after agreeing with the US to create a \"safe zone\" inside Syria's northeast border with Turkey, which would be cleared of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) armed group.\n\nKurdish forces bore the brunt of the ground campaign against ISIL but are considered \"terrorists\" by the Turkish government.\n\nThe White House statement was silent on what would happen to the Kurds.\n\nTurkey views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or the PKK.\n\nAnkara and Washington consider the PKK a \"terrorist\" group but they diverge on the issue of the YPG, which forms the core of US-backed Syrian forces against ISIL.", "description": "Republican says Trump's 'impulsive' decision to withdraw troops from northeast Syria will undo 'all gains we've made'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/11/14/1fece131eb694d0287b68bc3987bd906_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
