Some software issues keep it from being great, though. And if your phone isn\u2019t made by Samsung, plan on some software annoyances.\n\nThe obvious and clear success of the Apple Watch for iPhone owners has made the dearth of quality options for Android phones feel that much more acute. But Samsung has been quietly plugging away at improving the Galaxy Watch and the software that runs it. The result is a watch that checks off most of the boxes smartwatch buyers should care about.\n\nOur review of Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 Verge Score 7.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Touch-sensitive bezel\n\nOffline Spotify\n\nDecent battery life Bad Stuff Requires too many Samsung phone apps to work\n\nBixby\n\nNo good mapping solutions\n\nThe Galaxy Watch Active 2 is a round smartwatch that starts at $279, though you can pay higher prices depending on the size and LTE. It comes in 40 and 44mm sizes, has a few different finishes, and the watch bands can be easily swapped out. (The original Active is still available and slightly less expensive. The original Galaxy Watch with a physical rotating bezel is also sticking around for a higher price.)\n\nI like how unassuming the Active 2 looks. I have the basic black model, and its matte finish and slightly curved glass give it simple, clean lines. In a world where most Android smartwatches either look explicitly like fitness bands (the Fitbit) or emulate big, expensive watches (hiding how big they need to be), the Active 2 just looks like a simple watch.\n\nIt is not a watch I expected to exist because its predecessor is barely six months old. The main problem with the last one is that Samsung whiffed on supporting the very best feature of the Galaxy Watch lineup: a rotating bezel for scrolling through the software.\n\nThe Active 2 doesn\u2019t fully bring that back, but it now has a touch-sensitive capacitive ring around the screen. Dragging your finger around it to scroll through various screens feels much more intuitive than just swiping because the Active 2\u2019s interface is mostly built on circles.\n\nMore specifically, the software works by presenting you with a lot of screens you can quickly scroll through. In one direction, you have notifications. In the other, there are a bunch of widgets with discrete pieces of information. I enjoy jamming through these screens more with a physical bezel, but the touch-sensitive one isn\u2019t terrible and much better than not having this kind of control at all.\n\nOne of the reasons this interface works is that it\u2019s fast. Especially if you go with a simple watchface that doesn\u2019t have a bunch of information in complications, it\u2019s convenient to just rotate through your weather, calendar, and fitness. (It\u2019s such a good idea that Google lifted it wholesale for Wear OS.) That would never work if the watch were slow. You will have some delays when launching full apps, but the widget system means you don\u2019t have to that often.\n\nI also like that it has Spotify on it, and it\u2019s relatively easy to download Spotify playlists directly to the watch. But the quality of third-party apps drops off steeply from there. There\u2019s no built-in mapping or directions app, and the app store doesn\u2019t have anything good to fill the gap. The third-party app situation isn\u2019t very good at all, but then again, it\u2019s not great on any platform.\n\nSome reviewers have pointed out that there are YouTube and Twitter apps, but the YouTube one never worked for me, and the Twitter client involved an insecure signup process. Avoid them. Besides, there\u2019s a whole damn web browser built into the watch if you really want to access those sites. And yes, trying to navigate the web on a watch is as hilariously bad as you think.\n\nThere is a huge selection of third-party watchfaces to back up the many preinstalled faces from Samsung. I love having these options, but I feel like a little more curation could go a long way. I had to wade through a lot of gaudy watchfaces to find something I liked.\n\nThe Active 2 also does some things that other smartwatches (like the Apple Watch) can\u2019t pull off, like a built-in sleep tracker and a very clever \u201cgoodnight\u201d mode that turns off the always-on screen and notifications.\n\nOh, right: it has an always-on screen option, as all watches should. The screen looks great to me, even when viewing it outdoors in bright sunlight. I left it on and regularly got two full days of battery life, sometimes a little more if I didn\u2019t exercise.\n\nSpeaking of exercise, you should think of this as a smartwatch first and a fitness tracker second. Samsung does have a lot of tracking options and Samsung Health is actually better than you might expect, but overall accuracy in terms of steps and distance has been problematic.\n\nThe other hassle with the Active 2 is, well, Samsung. If you\u2019re using an iPhone, just move on and buy an Apple Watch. If you\u2019re using a Samsung phone, you likely have everything you need to pair up with this watch. If you\u2019re not, you will need to install several pieces of helper software, and it gets really onerous.\n\nAgree to Continue: Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we\u2019re going to start counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. Although what you need to agree to may vary depending on what kind of phone you\u2019re setting it up with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 requires you to agree to: The Samsung Privacy policy\n\nA Samsung End User License agreement These agreements are not negotiable, and you cannot use the phone at all if you don\u2019t agree to them. There are many other optional agreements. Some of them \u2014 like the agreements for health tracking and voice services \u2014 are optional but will keep the watch from doing the core things you bought it for, like tracking steps or voice search. Samsung Voice services Privacy Policy\n\nFind My Watch and Find My Phone location services acknowledgement\n\nHERE mapping Terms of Service\n\nHERE mapping Privacy Policy\n\nReport Diagnostic Info consent\n\nMarketing Information consent\n\nSamsung Health Terms and Conditions\n\nSamsung Health Privacy Policy Final tally: two mandatory agreements, eight optional agreements. Full disclosure: there may be more, but as a Samsung user I already had a Samsung account and whatever agreements were necessary to set that up.\n\nIf you can get past all that, you need to contend with the voice assistant on the watch: Bixby.\n\nBixby is better than it gets credit for, but it doesn\u2019t get much credit from anybody. Using it to transcribe short bits of texts works. But anytime you aim for something more ambitious, you\u2019re in for a delay at best or a sad message that it can\u2019t do it at worst. Since the third-party app situation on the Active 2 is so poor, you end up having to go to Bixby to do things like control smart home gadgets.\n\nThe Galaxy Watch Active 2 is the best* smartwatch for Android users. (The * isn\u2019t a typo; it\u2019s the indicator that there are some big caveats.) The Active 2 gets the basics right: it looks good, lasts at least a couple of days on a charge, has an always-on screen, and runs software that\u2019s fast and easy to use.\n\nThat is more than I can say for any other Android-compatible smartwatch. But the thin third-party app support, iffy fitness tracking accuracy, and sometimes onerous Samsung software keep it from being great. Still, I think it\u2019s a good smartwatch.\n\nFor Android users, \u201cgood\u201d is as good as it gets. I\u2019ll take it.", "description": "Samsung\u2019s latest smartwatch, the Galaxy Watch Active 2, is similar to the Galaxy Watch Active that came out earlier this year.
