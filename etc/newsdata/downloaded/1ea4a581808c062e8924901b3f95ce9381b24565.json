The city's 413 murders so far this year is high compared to other US cities, but it's nowhere near the brutality and scale of violence in Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2018, according to the UN peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan, 3,804 civilians were killed in conflict, including 927 children. In recent months, terrorist attacks by both the Taliban and ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K) have brutalized Afghans and horrified the international community.\n\nIn June, the Australia-based think tank Institute for Economics and Peace released its 2019 Global Peace Index, ranking Afghanistan as the least peaceful country in the world.\n\nThe IEP, which develops methods to \"analyse peace and to quantify its economic value,\" has released the GPI annually since 2007. The index measures the peacefulness of 162 countries by rating each one on 23 qualitative and quantitative metrics \u2014 such as deaths from conflict, violent crime, and access to weapons \u2014 which are divided into three categories.\n\nIn 2019, overall global peacefulness increased for the first time in five years, but the world is still less peaceful than it was 10 years ago, the report says.
