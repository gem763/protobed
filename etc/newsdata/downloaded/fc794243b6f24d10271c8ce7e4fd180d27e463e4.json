There would also be significant barriers in the way of any move to mixed martial arts, at least if his promoter Frank Warren has a say, but Fury says that if he does decide to move forward with the idea he will have the ideal tutor.\n\n\"I've been speaking to Conor [McGregor] about it and he will train me,\" Fury said. \"It's going to be good.\"\n\nUp the Fury\u2019s!

Getting hurt, getting blood - you saw my last fight, blood everywhere - nothing new to me,\" he explained. \"[It's] all a part of my heritage and upbringing, so I'd love to get in there and smash someone up.\"\n\nAlso on rt.com 'We will settle it, once and for all': Conor McGregor announces UFC return and vows to face Khabib Nurmagomedov again (VIDEO)\n\nFury, who has represented Ireland at international level earlier in his career, also outlined that the discussions between him and McGregor were serious.\n\n\"He said, 'Anytime you're ready, when you get the time, let's go.
