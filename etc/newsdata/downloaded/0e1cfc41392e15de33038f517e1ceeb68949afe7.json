United States beat Greece 69-53. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)\n\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 Donovan Mitchell scored 16 points and handed out 10 assists, Joe Harris scored 14 and the U.S. defeated Poland 87-74 on Saturday for seventh place at the World Cup.\n\nKhris Middleton had 13 points, six rebounds and six assists for the Americans, who will head home with a 6-2 record \u2014 yet their worst placing ever in a World Cup, world championship as it used to be known, or Olympics.\n\nDerrick White scored 12 and Harrison Barnes added 10 for the U.S.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMateusz Ponitka scored 18 points, Adam Waczynski had 17 and A.J. Slaughter finished with 15 for Poland (4-4), which was in the World Cup for the first time since 1967.\n\nThe Americans put together a 10-0 run in the first quarter to take a 28-14 lead. Poland started 0 for 13 from 3-point range, not getting one from beyond the arc to fall until Michal Sokolowski connected with 1:28 left in the half \u2014 and by then, the U.S. lead was 18.\n\nThere was little to play for except pride \u2014 and the Americans were playing with the realization that, for some of them, it easily could be their last time wearing the red, white and blue uniforms with \"USA\" across the chest. The roster for the U.S. trip to the Tokyo Olympics next summer is likely to look considerably different than this one.\n\nIt had much meaning to Poland coach Mike Taylor as well. He's an American, who lives in Florida, and mouthed along with the words to \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" when it played pregame.\n\nHis team wasn't eager to quit, either.\n\nDown 17 at the half, Poland made it a very serious game after intermission. Waczynski's 3-pointer from the right corner late in the third got Poland within 54-47, and Lukasz Koszarek had a 3-point try that would have gotten his team within four with 8:21 remaining.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nStory continues\n\nU.S.: Kemba Walker (neck) didn't play, joining Boston Celtics teammates Jayson Tatum (left ankle) and Marcus Smart (left hand) on the U.S. injured list. White started in Walker's place at point guard. ... Timing is everything \u2014 the 6-2 record for the U.S. here was better than silver-medalist Serbia (5-4) and bronze-medalist France (6-3) at the last World Cup. But losing in the quarterfinals doomed the U.S. medal hopes.\n\nPoland: The team had three players who played at the Division I level \u2014 Slaughter was a four-year player at Western Kentucky, guard Karol Gruszecki spent two years at Texas-Arlington and center Dominik Olejniczak started his career at Drake, then played two seasons at Ole Miss and will play this year at Florida State as a graduate transfer. ... Poland started 4-0 in China, then dropped its last four games.\n\nGIVEAWAY ITEMS\n\nMitchell was the last U.S. player to leave the court in the pre-warmup period, ending about 45 minutes before game time. He took off his sneakers and tossed them to a couple of young fans in the crowd.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nU.S.: Has already qualified for 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nPoland: Will participate in qualifying for 2020 Tokyo Olympics next year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "Donovan Mitchell scored 16 points and handed out 10 assists, Joe Harris scored 14 and the U.S. defeated Poland 87-74 on Saturday for seventh place at the World Cup.
