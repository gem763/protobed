A staggering 14.5 million gallons of untreated sewage entered the United States from Tijuana beginning Saturday, according to KGTV San Diego.\n\nDuring cleanup, a dead body was found obstructing an intake screen at a pump station where the raw sewage began to overflow. KGTV reports that it's unclear how the dead body ended up at the pump station, but the scene is being investigated.\n\nMonica Sanchez of the Media Research Center notes the sewage problem from Mexico is nothing new:\n\nIn fact, the sewage flow from Mexico has been going on for decades with no end in sight. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have even fallen ill after exposure to the toxic Mexican sewage. The city of San Diego first declared a State of Emergency over the situation some 25 years ago.\n\nThe Tijuana River crosses the border and flows into the Pacific Ocean, just south of San Diego.
