We thank you, we love you and I want you to know my administration is fighting for you each and every day,\u201d the president told an audience of roughly 50,000 at NRG Stadium, home to the NFL\u2019s Houston Texans.\n\nHe also made an emotional appeal to fight \u201cradial Islamic terrorism,\u201d eliciting a standing ovation from the crowd.\n\nMr. Trump called India a \u201ctrue and great friend\u201d of the U.S., returning the favor after Mr. Modi had lifted up Mr. Trump as the foremost figure in the world.\n\n\u201cHis name is familiar to every person on the planet,\u201d Mr. Modi said. \u201cHis name comes up in almost every conversation in the world on global politics.\u201d\n\nHouston is located in Harris County, which Mr. Trump lost by 12 percentage points in 2016 and is viewed as a critical piece of political real estate in Texas.\n\nDemocrats vying for the 2020 presidential nomination held their most recent primary debate in Houston, further underscoring its status as a state that could be up for grabs.\n\n\u201cTexas does seem to be trending Democratic, but the president did still win it by 9 points. It would take a big erosion for the president to lose it,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\n\nSome polling shows Texas as competitive, however, \u201cand obviously the president absolutely cannot afford to lose it,\u201d Mr. Kondik said.\n\nMr. Trump insisted he\u2019s still leading in Texas, but he doesn\u2019t want supporters to become complacent.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible to lose Texas. They want border security. They want to protect their Second Amendment, they want a lot of things we stand for,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible, but if people think you\u2019re going to win and win by a lot they don\u2019t go out to vote.\u201d\n\nIndian Americans tend to vote Democratic, though they could prove critical to Mr. Trump\u2019s fortunes in Texas if he can make inroads.\n\nThe Houston area alone is home to nearly 140,000 Indian American, according to AAPI Data, which tracks Asian American and Pacific Islander populations.\n\nMr. Trump has placed Indian Americans in high positions, including Nikki Haley as his former U.N. ambassador, Ajit Pai as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and Seema Verma as chief of public insurance programs.\n\nHighly educated Indians also might like his business-friendly policies.\n\nBut his strident immigration rhetoric and efforts to reel in visas that benefit Indian Americans, in particular, could be turning them off, said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a public policy professor at the University of California, Riverside and founder of AAPI Data.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to necessarily gain a lot of supporters but he might blunt some of the damage among Indian Americans and Asian Americans, to show a friendly face,\u201d he said.\n\nThere has been some friction between Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi.\n\nMr. Trump in March decided to end a trade-preference agreement that allowed India to send billions of dollars\u2019 worth of its exports into the U.S. duty-free. And the president claimed Mr. Modi asked him to negotiate the Indian-Pakistani clash over Kashmir, forcing the Modi administration to issue a denial.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump saw little downside to joining forces with Mr. Modi on stage in Houston.\n\nMany Indian Americans are motivated by domestic issues in the U.S., but among those who pay attention to foreign policy and India relations, \u201cModi seems to be quite popular,\u201d according to Mr. Ramakrishnan.\n\nThe belief is that \u201cin many ways he\u2019s trying to reform India, trying to clean up the corruption there,\u201d he said.\n\nOn stage, Mr. Trump pointed to Mr. Modi\u2019s push to lift people out of poverty, before pivoting to low unemployment in Texas under his administration.\n\nMr. Trump said he will take care of legal Indian immigrants ahead of migrants who \u201cpour into our country\u201d illegally.\n\nMr. Ramakrishnan said while Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi relish their roles as reformers, \u201cthey also are playing with fire a bit when it comes to the forces of ethnic nationalism.\u201d\n\nDemocrats vying for the 2020 nomination have repeatedly accused Mr. Trump of fanning the flames of white nationalism, particularly with his disparaging comments about immigrants who are in the country illegally and his reaction to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.\n\nCritics say Mr. Modi, meanwhile, took his vision of a unified, Hindu-dominated nation too far by moving to strip Muslim-majority Kashmir region of its special autonomous status.\n\nKashmiri residents have complained of security forces patrolling the streets, making them fearful to leave their homes, and say communication systems have been shut down or limited.\n\nJustice for All, which bills itself as an interfaith human rights group, said it gathered 20,000 people to protest the Houston rally.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
