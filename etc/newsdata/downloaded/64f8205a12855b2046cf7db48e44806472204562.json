As he has previously, Biden said, \u201cComparing [Obama] to the president we have is outrageous, No. 1. We didn't lock people up in cages. We didn't separate families. We didn't do all of those things.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you make a mistake with the deportations?\u201d Ramos tried, again.\n\n\u201cThe president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time,\u201d Biden offered.\n\nWhen the debate concluded, Biden approached Ramos and had a conversation that a high-level Univision source with knowledge of the exchange described as contentious. Biden\u2019s message was that Ramos\u2019s questions were a low blow, that he fought for \u201cDreamers\u201d as vice president, and that while they didn\u2019t get deportations right early on in the administration, they did by the end.\n\nAs Biden readies for another Democratic debate Tuesday night, his record on immigration has to be on a long list of concerns, along with President Trump\u2019s attacks on him and his son Hunter, his vanishing lead over Elizabeth Warren in recent polls and the danger of another ambush like the one Kamala Harris launched over his record on school busing. The exchange with Ramos echoed the previous debate, when activists interrupted Biden, chanting, \u201cThree million deportations! Three million deportations!\u201d In an interview afterward, as they drank beers, the activists from Movement Cosecha were asked what they actually want to hear from Biden.\n\n\u201cBiden hasn\u2019t apologized. He wants the Latino vote, but he\u2019s not saying, \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019\u201d Ofelia, an activist with the group who withheld her last name because of the current immigration climate, told Yahoo News in Spanish. \u201cWhen you were VP you didn\u2019t speak against it, but now you have a chance to change that. We didn\u2019t forget. Say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re not going to do that anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThere can be no daylight between Biden and Obama; he\u2019s always going to get Obama\u2019s back,\u201d a source close to the campaign explained. \u201cHe knows mistakes were made at the beginning [on deportations], but they did get it right at the end.\u201d\n\nBiden doesn\u2019t grasp \u2014 or perhaps genuinely isn\u2019t concerned \u2014 that by defending Obama and refusing to reckon with his immigration policy and record deportations, he\u2019s sending a message to Democrats and activists that a Biden administration will be no different.\n\nBut that won\u2019t be the last time Biden will be put on the defensive over the issue, as he runs for the presidential nomination in a party where even as Obama remains personally popular his immigration policies are increasingly viewed as problematic. More than the crime bill, or busing, two issues from his past that have been heavily litigated during the campaign, what Biden believes on immigration and the moral authority he brings to a potential fight with Trump could help decide whether he is the one who takes back the White House for the Democrats to begin the job of undoing Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nDigging into Biden\u2019s record reveals tough votes during his long Senate career that activists will want him to answer for, but also a story he can tell about his decades-long support for admitting immigrants to the United States and a bipartisan approach to the issue that bolster his argument that he has the experience to actually govern.\n\nBiden has long described immigration as stitched into the American fabric, as he did three decades ago, during the final Senate session for the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, better known as Ronald Reagan\u2019s amnesty law.\n\nBiden, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time, expressed hope that legalizing undocumented immigrants would \u201cmove a growing underclass living in the shadows into the daylight of citizenship and opportunity. These individuals must become full participants in our society, not just the object of our concern.\u201d He added: \u201cImmigration has always been in the national interest, and the amnesty program in this bill represents the best of that tradition. By turning strangers in our midst into friends and neighbors we trust.\"\n\nIn 1994, tucked inside the controversial crime bill Biden designed was a Battered Women Immigrant Provision. This section \u201callowed undocumented women physically abused by their partners to petition for legal status themselves. Previously, they were only able to do so through a husband who had legal status, putting untold numbers of women at the mercy of their abusers,\u201d wrote socialist magazine Jacobin in a discussion of Biden\u2019s record earlier this year. But the thrust of the article was contained in the headline: \u201cJoe Biden, Anti-Immigrant Enabler.\u201d\n\nOne of the elements in that assessment was his vote for the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The bill, widely supported by Democrats at the time, is now viewed as a vehicle for making deportations easier, establishing the practice of deputizing local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration law, and creating the punitive three- and 10-year bars, which prohibit reentry based on time spent in the country illegally. In 2016, Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona and 32 other Democrats put forward a resolution calling for repealing much of the law.\n\nIn 2006, Biden, along with other Democratic senators including Obama and Hillary Clinton, voted for the Secure Fence Act, which authorized 700 miles of fencing along the border. This was part of a pattern by Democrats, including Obama, to offer border security enhancements in hopes of winning concessions on legalizing undocumented immigrants. Progressives now regard that as a failed strategy.\n\nPresident George W. Bush signs H.R. 6061, the Secure Fence Act of 2006, at the White House.

While seeking to provide a path to bring 12 million undocumented immigrants, including 1.6 million children, out of the \u201cshadows,\u201d Biden also proposed increased appropriations for border patrol agents, opposed driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants, and said, in a debate, that sanctuary cities shouldn't be allowed to ignore federal law.\n\nAsked to comment, current campaign officials told Yahoo News the immigration policies of Biden\u2019s administration would be informed by the policy he implemented as vice president, specifically his work in Central America, as well as his recent public statements.\n\nHow Biden viewed immigration during his time as vice president was often revealed by a story he loved to tell then.\n\nBiden told the story to many people at the time, but it\u2019s saved for posterity on an \u201cAsk the White House\u201d YouTube video from December 2013 featuring Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, Obama\u2019s domestic policy counsel. In Biden\u2019s telling, as the administration pushed for passage of the Senate\u2019s bipartisan immigration reform bill, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore\u2019s founding father, said China was looking for America\u2019s \u201cblack box,\u201d the thing that enables it to constantly remake itself. \u201cI can tell them what\u2019s in that black box \u2014 immigration,\u201d Biden said. \u201cA constant stream of immigration from our inception. That\u2019s what makes us the most innovative, the most unique country in the world. At its core we\u2019re a nation of immigrants.\u201d\n\nBut that view was challenged, during the summer of 2014, as a wave of unaccompanied minors came across the border \u2014 some 60,000, with internal estimates that it could have reached as many as 100,000, according to former White House officials. With Biden in the midst of a multicountry swing through Latin America, advisers recall the West Wing calling with an urgent directive: He had to sit down with the heads of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, known as the Northern Triangle countries, and deliver a stern warning that they should do as much as possible to stop migrants from coming to the U.S.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s thinking at the time, according to Juan Gonzalez, a Biden adviser on Latin America, was \u201cwe can\u2019t just ask these guys to not send people up to us; obviously they\u2019re leaving for a reason. We should offer a carrot here to address why people are leaving.\u201d Biden\u2019s message to the Northern Triangle leaders became, \u201cIf you guys can develop a serious plan together, I promise that we will back you.\u201d\n\nBacking them came in the form of a $750 million bipartisan aid agreement for which Biden took the lead in convincing members of Congress that it was worth it. The sales job involved him pitching Republican members that it made no sense to devote 90 percent of federal funding to dealing with the crisis on the border, but only 10 percent on helping governments address and stem the root causes of migration.\n\nFrom left, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, Joe Biden, Guatemalan President Otto P\u00e9rez Molina and Salvadoran President Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n in 2015.

But they acknowledge that he took the lead on Central American issues during a perilous time for thousands of migrants coming to the country.\n\nDuring a May 2014 meeting at the White House between Obama and activists, where the president announced he was going to enact a second executive action on immigration known as DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans), Biden showed up to share how he was engaging with his counterparts in Central America, said attendee Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to address the situation of migrants coming from Central America unless we\u2019re looking at the root causes; we have to be looking at migration not as a domestic issue, but from a foreign policy perspective as well,\u201d she said of the current dilemma.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign discussed tying immigration to foreign policy at the highest levels, according to the campaign\u2019s former national political director, Amanda Renteria, due to Clinton\u2019s experience as secretary of state, but never rolled out a plan.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes Biden\u2019s immigration work around Latin America more attractive,\u201d Renteria said.\n\nImmigration reform advocates march to the Capitol in 2014. (Photo: Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images) More\n\nAn advantage for Biden over some of his Democratic opponents \u2014 who advocate decriminalizing border crossing \u2014 is that Trump couldn\u2019t charge him with supporting \u201copen borders.\u201d The former vice president could invoke talking points about \u201csmart\u201d border security, while hammering the president on issues where there is a stark contrast, like family separation and eroding due process for asylum seekers.\n\nIf Biden openly explains and defends his record on immigration, he could emphasize the contrast with Trump and make immigration a top legislative campaign priority early in his presidency, pleasing advocates who seek major reforms to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). But party officials, including some who support Biden or are advising the campaign, say he needs to understand that he has to begin by admitting Obama made mistakes.\n\n\u201cIs Biden going to continue being the deporter in chief or is he going to learn from the mistakes and chart a different path on immigration?\u201d asked longtime Nevada Democratic strategist Andres Ramirez, who worked with the Obama administration on projects such as getting Latinos signed up for the Affordable Care Act. \u201cTrump\u2019s record on immigration is an abomination, but Latinos are right to demand clarity on where candidates stand on this issue.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s team is being advised on immigration policy by a loose network of unofficial advisers and stakeholders on domestic immigration and Latin American issues, and includes an intentional focus on recruiting and engaging Latina validators, say women who have been reached out to by Biden senior adviser and former Latino Victory president Cristobal Alex.\n\nStill, Cristina Jimenez, the executive director of United We Dream, who met with the campaign this summer to give her organization\u2019s views on how it should approach immigration, said that because of the rise in deportations under an administration Biden was a part of, her organization will be asking not just how Biden would govern differently than Trump, but also differently than Obama.\n\n\u201cI look forward to hearing how they will help our communities, without harming our communities more,\u201d she said.\n\n\"Vice President Biden has said previously that early in the Obama-Biden administration immigration laws were not being enforced effectively, which is why in 2014 they changed course,\u201d the Biden campaign told Yahoo News. \u201cThe administration reprioritized enforcement that went after violent criminals and repeat offenders, not families.\n\nThe campaign said Biden believes fixing the system starts with addressing the root causes of immigration abroad and working toward comprehensive immigration reform at home, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and smart border security.\n\n\u201cThose are the big contours, but what\u2019s obviously different \u2014 if he\u2019s elected president he knows how to get it done,\u201d a source close to the campaign said, again pointing to Biden\u2019s Latin America work and relationships in Congress. \u201cAs much as folks can\u2019t stand the idea of Congress, you need to pass legislation. At the end of the day you can\u2019t rely on executive action.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama greets law enforcement leaders from across the country in 2014.

(Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images) More\n\nBiden wants voters to see him as someone who can reach across the aisle, but he would be seeking to pass immigration reform in a political environment even more polarized in Trump\u2019s wake. That\u2019s why activists want Biden to pledge to use his finite political capital to make immigration a legislative priority immediately as president, beyond using executives orders to rescind Trump policies on day one, as he has promised.\n\nJanet Murguia, president of UnidosUS, the nation\u2019s largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization, who called Obama the \u201cdeporter in chief\u201d in 2014, said she does expect Biden and other Democrats to make immigration a priority in their first 100 days because of the damage done by Trump. \u201cNo question, 100 days is still a good measure to evaluate how a candidate will execute once they\u2019re president,\u201d she said.\n\nThe other area where Biden can show he\u2019s paying attention to the realities of immigration in America, Democrats argue, is in reining in ICE, CBP and DHS, which are not hallowed institutions created by the Founding Fathers, but were instead all created post-9/11, over four months from 2002 to 2003.\n\nThe Obama administration infamously had difficulty getting ICE to enact its directives, like the Morton memo, which called for prosecutorial discretion on veterans, people who have lived lawfully in the U.S. for years, pregnant women, and domestic violence and trafficking victims, in favor of focusing on national security risks, gang members and serious felons. Yet the Trump administration has had no problem getting these same agents to zealously implement its zero tolerance agenda.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a conversation about the brutality used by agents at the border. Seven children died at the hands of this administration,\u201d United We Dream\u2019s Jimenez said.\n\nThe former vice president left room for modifying the scope and organization of these agencies when he was in the Senate. While Biden voted to create DHS, in a floor speech before the vote, he said he feared \u201cbecause of the speed with which we considered this proposal, the rapid, sweeping reorganization it immediately envisions and the prospect for abuse in several of its provisions, I fear this bill will need to be revisited several times and its implementation will need to be closely monitored by Congress if we hope to get it right.\u201d\n\nBiden echoed those ideas during a July meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) and again during his meeting with Latino leaders in August, according to meeting attendees, who said his message was that there is a culture of corruption within ICE that needs to be rooted out. As a show of solidarity with CHC members in July regarding the need for better leadership at DHS, Biden surprised some in the room when he turned to Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., and said, \u201cWell, I think you would be great.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s Latino supporters like Nevada state Sen. Yvanna Cancela, who endorsed him on the day he launched his campaign despite overtures from seven other contenders, believe that Biden would be willing to enact these reforms as president.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the CPB mission, it\u2019s related to terrorists, so when you have that agency doing the work of dealing with migrant children and families at the border, it essentially means we\u2019re treating them like terrorists,\u201d she said. \u201cI trust that because of his experience the VP will know how to change those agencies from the inside out.\u201d\n\nNow Biden just has to start talking about it.\n\nAdrian Carrasquillo is a national political reporter covering 2020 and Latino issues who has written for NBC News, BuzzFeed, Politico Magazine and Texas Monthly.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Joe Biden sees himself as a champion of an aspirational, yet pragmatic, policy, but Latino activists think he needs to apologize for millions of deportations while he was vice president.
