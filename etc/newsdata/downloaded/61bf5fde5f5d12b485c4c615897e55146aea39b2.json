REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the Oct. 31 departure date, Brexit descended into a public row between London and Brussels this week as both sides position for another delay followed by an election in Britain or an acrimonious divorce.\n\nAfter a Downing Street source said a Brexit deal was essentially impossible because German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made unacceptable demands, the EU accused Johnson of playing a \u201cstupid blame game\u201d.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said striking a Brexit deal ahead of Oct. 31 would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d and the bloc could not accept Johnson\u2019s proposals. He added that a deal was \u201cstill possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put things frankly, we are not really in a position to be able to find agreement with the UK,\u201d Barnier told the European Parliament. He said he would be available 24/7 in the coming days to try to strike a deal.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he was working for a Brexit deal, which he also said was still possible.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t accept this blame game that started in London. Personally, I don\u2019t exclude a deal,\u201d Juncker told the European Parliament\u2019s plenary session.\n\n\u201cThe risk of a no-deal remains real and basically is going to come down to a decision by the UK government, but will never be the choice \u2014 the preferred option \u2014 of the European Union.\u201d\n\nThe European Union\u2019s two most powerful leaders, Germany\u2019s Merkel and France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, will meet at the Elysee Palace this Sunday ahead of an Oct. 17-18 EU summit, Macron\u2019s office said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still cautiously, cautiously optimistic,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nBREXIT DEAL?\n\nEU diplomats, though, are skeptical about the chances of a deal. Most expect Johnson to be forced to accept a delay to Brexit - a step that could ultimately lead to either a disorderly exit or the reversal of the entire Brexit endeavor.\n\n\u201cThere will be no rabbit-out-of-the-hat solutions,\u201d one EU official told Reuters. \u201cThere will be more talks and more political contacts. But, for the time being, there is no breakthrough to be reported.\u201d\n\nJohnson has repeatedly cast the EU summit next week as the last chance for the EU to strike a deal or face the disruption of a no-deal Brexit that would divide the West, threaten the unity of the United Kingdom and roil financial markets.\n\nA week ago, he proposed a possible solution to ensure the border between the British-ruled province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland does not become a backdoor into the EU\u2019s single market and customs union.\n\nShort of an last-minute breakthrough, Johnson will have to decide whether to accept another delay or to go for a no-deal Brexit and get around a law demanding he extend.\n\nIn the fevered atmosphere surrounding Brexit where newspaper reports and contradictory tweets can send sterling into gyrations, EU officials denied a report in The Times that the bloc was preparing a major concession to Britain to secure a deal.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, no bold new offer is coming from the EU side at this stage,\u201d an EU official said.\n\nBritain\u2019s Brexit minister, Steve Barclay, was due to have lunch with EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Thursday.\n\nBehind the rhetoric, the Brexit finale will ultimately be decided by Merkel, Macron, Johnson, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar - all of whom say they want an orderly exit.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nJohnson and Varadkar are due to meet on Thursday.\n\nWith chances of a deal receding, focus was turning back to British domestic politics, where Johnson is under intense pressure from opponents to delay Brexit.\n\nAnti-Brexit campaigners claimed victory after Scotland\u2019s highest court decided on Wednesday to wait before ruling whether to force Johnson to seek a delay to Britain\u2019s EU divorce date if he has not struck a deal in the next 10 days.", "description": "The European Union told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson he must make significant concessions if he wants to strike a last-minute Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438901478&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981MB", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
