There have been many times in the past few years when I\u2019ve called myself a California nationalist: Sure, America seemed to be going crazy, but at least I lived in the Golden State, where things were still pretty chill.\n\nBut lately my affinity for my home state has soured. Maybe it\u2019s the smoke and the blackouts, but a very un-Californian nihilism has been creeping into my thinking. I\u2019m starting to suspect we\u2019re over. It\u2019s the end of California as we know it. I don\u2019t feel fine.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the fires \u2014 although, my God, the fires. Is this what life in America\u2019s most populous, most prosperous state is going to be like from now on? Every year, hundreds of thousands evacuating, millions losing power, hundreds losing property and lives? Last year, the air near where I live in Northern California \u2014 within driving distance of some of the largest and most powerful and advanced corporations in the history of the world \u2014 was more hazardous than the air in Beijing and New Delhi. There\u2019s a good chance that will happen again this month, and that it will keep happening every year from now on. Is this really the best America can do?", "description": "The fires and the blackouts are connected to a larger problem in this state: a failure to live sustainably.", "authors": ["Farhad Manjoo"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/opinion/30Manjoo-1/30Manjoo-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
