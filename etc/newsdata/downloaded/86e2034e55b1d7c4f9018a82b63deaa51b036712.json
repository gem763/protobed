Together, the efforts offered a preview of the approach the president plans to employ as the impeachment fight intensifies.\n\nThe whistle-blower who flagged Trump\u2019s troubling behavior \u201cis a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government,\u201d White House senior adviser Stephen Miller told Fox News on Sunday. The inquiry \u201cis just one of the many and unending attacks the Democrats have leveled against the president,\u201d the senior Republican on the House Oversight Committee, Jim Jordan of Ohio, told CNN.\n\nThe president himself tweeted Sunday that Democrats seeking \u201cunlawful impeachment\u201d who represent districts he won should expect to lose their jobs in the 2020 election. \u201cWe will win big!\u201d the president said. He later demanded to meet the whistle-blower and people who provided the person information, and said House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff -- who is leading the impeachment inquiry -- should be investigated for treason and fraud.\n\nTrump repeated some of those statements on Twitter Monday morning, suggesting that Schiff be arrested for treason and saying that he did nothing wrong in the call with the president of Ukraine. \u201cCase closed!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nTrump won the White House in 2016 on a campaign built around the grievances of white, working-class voters who felt Washington had done nothing to prevent a decline in their living standards. But the approach failed him in 2018, when he tried to keep Republican control of the House by ginning up fear of criminal immigrants. Ahead of 2020, he is portraying himself as the victim, the subject of two partisan \u201cwitch hunts\u201d to oust him, and urging his loyal base to punish his opponents at the polls.\n\nTrump has shown he will make no effort at recompense for his conduct in a July 25 telephone call with Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. After freezing military aid to Ukraine, which is battling a Russia-backed insurgency, the U.S. president asked Zelenskiy to investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and encouraged him to work on the matter with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr.\n\n\u2018We Are Ready\u2019\n\nThe president\u2019s strategy hasn\u2019t deterred Democrats, who are pushing ahead on a schedule that could deliver articles of impeachment as early as December, even though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi herself once fretted that a backlash would benefit the president.\n\n\u201cWe could not ignore what the president did,\u201d Pelosi said in an interview Sunday on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cI always said we will follow the facts where they take us. And when we see them, we will be ready. And we are ready.\u201d\n\nThe White House has resisted suggestions that Trump needs to appoint an impeachment \u201cczar\u201d or create a \u201cwar room\u201d to oversee a response to the inquiry. Officials say that\u2019s unnecessary, echoing the president\u2019s insistence that his call with Zelenskiy was \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting that from people who want to create an impeachment war room to either get back in or get through the front door in the first place,\u201d senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters on Friday. \u201cWhy would he do that? Who started the war here?\u201d\n\nOne of the president\u2019s personal attorneys, Jay Sekulow, also downplayed the need for an expanded legal team to respond to the Ukraine scandal. Sekulow said Saturday that the \u201cteam that has been in place will respond as appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no war room being established,\u201d Sekulow said.\n\nConway last week was among the Trump advisers who unsuccessfully argued against publicly releasing the White House memorandum documenting Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nFamiliar Strategy\n\nTrump\u2019s Ukraine strategy is familiar to veterans of the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, the allegations that Trump\u2019s second pick for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, engaged in sexual misconduct, or regular presidential rallies where his supporters are cast as a forgotten class oppressed by political and media elites.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump solicited advice on heading off his impeachment from Republican lawmakers and confidants over the weekend, but made clear his main tactic will be publicly ratcheting up his grievances against opponents in the hope of exacting as much political damage as possible.The approach", "authors": ["Justin Sink"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bWiNNgRwObHEBO37OScSpg--~B/aD0xMTEwO3c9MTQ4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/d13d4419665f2fc63ef4f371aa1b157f", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
