We played in the same team in Egypt and then he left to join Basel.\n\n\"After that, I followed him, and I joined Basel. We were together most of the time. Then he went to England, after that I went to England.\n\n\"I don't want to say he is my friend because he is much closer to me.\"", "description": "Gunners midfielder has had a disappointing start to loan spell at Besiktas but could be offered an escape route", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Empics Sport", "Andy Rain Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19110515.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-v-Chelsea-Community-Shield-Wembley.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
