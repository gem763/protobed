Turkish troops soon moved into those areas. On Monday Turkish media published photos showing members of the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army\u2014a collection of Syrian and other jihadist mercenaries\u2014preparing to fight Kurds and non-Muslims. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu issued a statement saying his country would \u201cclear the region from terrorists.\u201d\n\nAs early clashes between SDF and Turkish troops left six SDF soldiers dead and 15 wounded, Washington was in turmoil over Trump\u2019s decision, with even stalwart supporters condemning it.\n\nTrump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Twitter, \u201cThis decision to abandon our Kurdish allies and turn Syria over to Russia, Iran, & Turkey will put every radical Islamist on steroids.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also condemned the move, along with others off Capitol Hill.\n\nThe U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) issued a statement calling for a halt to Turkish airstrikes. Civilians \u201cwho represent a diverse group of religious and ethnic communities, are now at dangerous risk of falling victim to violent chaos,\u201d said chairman Tony Perkins.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said, \u201cWe must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back. The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake.\u201d\n\nGen. Joseph Votel, commander of U.S. Central Command with charge of all U.S. forces in the region until he stepped down in March, called Trump\u2019s move a \u201cgreen light\u201d for Turkey that \u201cthreatens to undo five years\u2019 worth of fighting against ISIS.\u201d\n\nVotel echoed other concerns of military and diplomatic experts, saying it \u201cwill severely damage American credibility and reliability in any future fights where we need strong allies.\u201d\n\nTrump compounded that perception in statements that have followed, calling a Turkish offensive \u201ca bad idea\u201d and threatening to \u201cobliterate the Economy of Turkey\u201d if it steps out of bounds. But the withdrawal taps a populist nerve, as many Americans believe ending U.S. military involvement in the Middle East is past due.\n\n\u201cThe concept that we have too many troops, too many soldiers, too much of a presence in the world is a perfectly defendable one and one that I think many Americans share,\u201d said Alberto Fernandez, a former U.S. diplomat who is president of the Middle East Broadcasting Networks. \u201cBut the reality is our presence on the ground in Syria with the SDF, with the YPG allies, Kurdish and non-Kurdish fighters, was a force for good. It prevented our adversaries from gaining that territory. It protected religious minorities, including Syrian Christians in that area.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces have merged militias from Kurds, Syriac Christians, and Arabs, led by the Kurdish YPG fighters. As the YPG fought ISIS in 2014 to prevent the takeover of Kobani, Turkey refused to allow U.S. jets to use the U.S. airbase at Incirlik in Turkey in support of their effort. Turkey considers the YPG an extension of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a group responsible for terror attacks inside Turkey.\n\nWith an ISIS victory in Kobani imminent, President Barack Obama bypassed Turkey, dropping weapons and key supplies to the Kurds in Kobani, and later provided air cover in the fight. The YPG and later SDF proved successful at routing ISIS across northern Syria, including the Christian villages held by ISIS along the Khabur River, and in Raqqa, the capital of the ISIS \u201ccaliphate.\u201d\n\nIn all, the SDF has lost 11,000 fighters in these combat operations.\n\nOn Oct. 8 Genocide Watch renewed a 2018 genocide warning for northeast Syria, saying, \u201cKurds, Christians, and Yezidis in Northeast Syria are at grave risk of genocide by the armies of Turkey and Syria.\u201d\n\nThe Syriac Union Party, an opposition party led by Christians from the north\u2019s Hasakah region, released a statement condemning Turkish attacks, and warning that the existence of Syriac Christians and other Christian communities in northeast Syria is now in danger.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://world.wng.org/sites/default/files/field/image/SMOKE-193.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
