TLRD, -29.85% says the road to its future growth is lined with florals, tropical patterns and NFL team logos. The company, whose portfolio of brands includes Men's Wearhouse and Joseph A. Bank, says its custom suiting business is on the rise, with unique, digitally-printed patterns for jacket linings becoming popular items. \"We've seen a strong response since the launch of the program and the good news is, is that these digitally-printed linings have a short lead time, allowing us to test into new designs without needing to acquire significant inventory upfront,\" said Tailored Brands' Chief Executive Dinesh Lathi on the late Wednesday earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript. Tailored Brands has a multiyear licensing agreement with the National Football League, which will allow them to customize suits with images depicting fans' favorite teams. Tailored Brands is also focused on the more casual style of dress that has become standard nowadays. Lathi said the company had \"challenging traffic trends\" but \"polished casual categories,\" like sportswear, dress coats, and short sleeve shirts did well. Tailored Brands announced last month that it sold its corporate apparel business. After the closing bell on Wednesday, the company gave weak earnings guidance and said it was halting its dividend to pay down debt. Tailored Brands stock has plummeted more than 23% in Thursday trading, and is down 77% for the last year. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.29% is down 4.4% for the past 12 months.", "description": "Tailored Brands Inc. says the road to its future growth is lined with florals, tropical patterns and NFL team logos.
