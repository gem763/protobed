(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said Thursday that President Trump does not regret using the term \u201chuman scum\u201d to describe Republicans who criticize him, saying they are \u201cjust that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people who are against him and have been against him and working against him since the day he took office are just that,\u201d Grisham said on Fox News. \u201cThey deserve strong language like that.\u201d\n\nTrump lashed out Wednesday at \u201cNever Trumper Republicans,\u201d calling them more \u201cdangerous\u201d to the country than Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them, they are human scum!\u201d the president wrote on Twitter.\n\nTrump\u2019s frustration came as he pressured Republicans to \u201cget tougher and fight\u201d House Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe against him. The president expressed support for a group of Republican members of Congress who stormed a closed-door hearing on Wednesday where a Pentagon official was testifying to the House Intelligence Committee. The Republicans argued the hearing before the Democrat-led committee should be more transparent.\n\n\u201cHe was happy to see it happen,\u201d Grisham said of Trump\u2019s reaction to the protest. \u201cHe was very supportive of it, as he should be.\u201d\n\nA day earlier, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, testified to Congress that he was aware of an effort by the Trump administration to withhold U.S. military aid to Ukraine unless Ukrainian officials agreed to state publicly that they would investigate the business dealings of Trump\u2019s 2020 opponent Joe Biden and his son.\n\nTaylor is represented by Republican lawyer John Bellinger, who loudly opposed Trump\u2019s candidacy in 2016 and has called Trump \u201cmost reckless president in American history.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever Trumper Republican John Bellinger, represents Never Trumper Diplomat Bill Taylor (who I don\u2019t know), in testimony before Congress!\u201d Trump wrote in a subsequent tweet, adding that he does not want such Republicans working in his administration.\n\n\u201cIt would be really great if the people within the Trump Administration, all well-meaning and good (I hope!), could stop hiring Never Trumpers, who are worse than the Do Nothing Democrats. Nothing good will ever come from them!\u201d he wrote.", "description": "\u201cThe people who are against him and have been against him and working against him since the day he took office are just that,\" Grisham said on Fox News.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Ilya Shapiro", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
