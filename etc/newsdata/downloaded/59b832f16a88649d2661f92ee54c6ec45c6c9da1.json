If this process finds him to have violated human rights\u201a he will have to face the music.\n\n\"We have given the space to the rugby leadership to speak to the coach and he did say that if it is found that any of his players are on the wrong side of race relations in this country\u201a steps will have to be taken. It cuts across and that is the position of government.\"\n\nMthethwa added that despite the impending investigation, Mzansi needs to unite behind the Springboks.\n\n\"We will be watching and the team must be supported 100 percent because they are not representing an individual but the whole country,\" continued Mthethwa.\n\n\"They are hoisting the flag of SA high\u201a so all South Africans must be behind the team to win.\"\n\nDespite the cloud hanging over his head, Etzebeth is likely to start for the Boks in their quarter-final clash next Sunday, October 20.\n\n", "description": "Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa has finally broken his silence over the Eben Etzebeth saga.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9466/09d445b42ea34204a180f5f453cd784d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
