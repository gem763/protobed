But if you\u2019ve ever wondered what it would be like for an actual, professional driver to break down some of the more classic driving scenes in recent film history, then, my friends, you are in luck,\n\nTwo-wheel-drive Rally America champion Wyatt Knox from Team O\u2019Neil Rally School has teamed up with WIRED to break down the feasibility of some iconic driving, racing, and crash scenes in everything from Back to the Future to The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. And it\u2019s one hell of a fun watch:\n\n(If you came for a breakdown of any Baby Driver scenes, then I am very sorry to say that you\u2019ll be disappointed. Hook us up with the good stuff next time, Wyatt.)\n\nI love these breakdowns because I didn\u2019t even really notice any of this stuff the first time around. The fact that there wasn\u2019t actually a driver in one of the cop cars that crashed in Transporter 2? Didn\u2019t even notice it\u2014that\u2019s legit. A Mustang GT versus a Chrysler 300 in Drive (truly, one of the best movies of all time)? I don\u2019t care if the Mustang would blow the doors off its competitor in real life\u2014it\u2019s a damn good scene, and movie magic (also Ryan Gosling) keeps me from caring.\n\nTreat yourself today.
