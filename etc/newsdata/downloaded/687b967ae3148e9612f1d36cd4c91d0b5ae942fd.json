Three things: the artist, a knife and an ear. Outside, 2 degrees Celsius. One second \u2013 and a stream of blood, obeying the universal law of gravity, flows down, adding a new colour to the picture. The artist, completely naked, will spend the next two hours with a knife in his right hand and a cut off earlobe in the left. He doesn\u2019t blink, or perhaps I cannot see it. He is silent. He looks, but he doesn\u2019t see. He\u2019s frozen and only the cold air that hits him, shakes him, gives him shivers, brings out a man in him and not a Roman statue that materialised on the wall enclosing the Serbsky State Scientific Centre for Social and Forensic Psychiatry. And of course, the blood, still flowing and which I will later see on his leg and his buttocks. A passing pigeon sits briefly next to him, taking a part in the protest \u2013 the artist and the wall become one.\n\nHe is silent.\n\nHalf an hour passes before the first police car arrives and stops nearby. Cautiously, two policemen approach. Then, three security guards come out of the clinic\u2019s entrance. And a fourth person, a female doctor.\n\n\u201cSir! Sir!\u201d\n\nBut the artist installation stays silent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not responding to attempts of a contact,\u201d the doctor tells herself.\n\nTen minutes later, an ambulance arrives and a corpulent woman with a blue cross on her uniform \u2013 seemingly a medic \u2013 gets out. But it turns out that her main task is to argue with the doctor from the psychiatric ward and forbid a girl \u2013 the live-in girlfriend of the artist \u2013 to film. Aside from that, she\u2019s not helpful, perhaps except a phrase:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s cut his stomach open!\u201d confidently, she utters a diagnosis. By now, the streaming blood has formed a crimson crust in the folds of his stomach.\n\n\u201cBe careful! He has a knife!\u201d warns a newly arrived cop, turning his back to the artist to demonstrate a shortened version of the Kalashnikov assault rifle, strapped tightly on his back.\n\n\u201cNow, he can jump and start cutting us all,\u201d notes a fireman, inhaling a cigarette \u2013 his crew arrived a few minutes earlier. He wears a red helmet and a fire-proof uniform which seems to protect him from accidentally setting himself on fire from cigarettes.\n\nBut by now, there are also regular spectators in this surrealistic theatre: an old woman with her granddaughter passes by. The elderly woman demonstratively turns away her head \u2013 and her granddaughter uses the moment to study the subject around whom all these respected people gathered. I understand her perfectly \u2013 it does not happen often to see a naked guy with a slicer in his hand, with which he cut his earlobe off and who sits atop a tall fence in front of a psychiatric hospital in Moscow\u2019s centre.\n\nThere are other people. And more cops. Last leaves keep falling down from the trees \u2013 who knows, perhaps today is the last sunny day of the year? I look at the artist. He is shivering. I am shivering as well. Although I am wearing a cosy jumper and a warm jacket, my fingers are beginning to freeze in my gloves. The sun gets behind the clouds \u2013 the winter is near.\n\nIt\u2019s been long. Very long. All keep looking at him \u2013 and he looks at something, somewhere far out. Later, when asked what was he thinking about, he said: \u201cThis is my frontline, where it is sometimes necessary to sacrifice a part of one\u2019s body, or a sense of comfort. For the protest to succeed, the action must be completed. And those people I talked about in this protest have been exposed to the punishment of our psychiatric system and they sacrificed their lives, which will never be the same.\u201d\n\nAdditional d\u00e9cor \u2013 guards carry out blue mattresses and form circles around the artist, asking him to jump. But this leads to nothing. He sits silently, does not see them, or pretends not to see.\n\nTime goes by. \u201cThey are about to take him down,\u201d whispers into my ear a girl nearby. At this moment, four policemen get behind him. The first, gently removes the knife away and holds his hands to the side. Two other cops take him under his arms, one is smiling. The artist is not resisting. Two men with a stretcher enter the area.\n\nAgain, just a regular street scene. Only a lonely cop unwinds a red and white tape to block the scene off from the street.", "description": "Artist Pyotr Pavlensky holds a knife after cutting off a part of his ear at the Centre for Social and Forensic Psychiatry.", "authors": ["Maxim Zmeyev"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ50kUUEl_KFlfLXBaDg1DViYYdC1F4apdEgRX91C6pScQk7A04eUG2gBF_pEigqNy_2ih_uXJ_FO4Q8THM5SVfc2lPO8Iy95TdFqyPk0a5dn"}
