After reading and watching reports about his presidency, \u201cHe\u2019d be angry and ask, \u2018Why can\u2019t we stop these things?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted to polygraph every employee in the building to unearth who it was who spoke to the press,\u201d said another former official, who noted that the president tended to be especially irate when he knew specific news accounts were true. Some White House staffers have even volunteered to take a polygraph to prove their innocence after they were suspected of leaking, according to the former official.\n\nThe new details of Trump\u2019s repeated interest in polygraphing provide important context on the president\u2019s state of mind as Democrats demand answers about the White House\u2019s handling of records of his interactions with foreign leaders. A whistleblower has accused White House officials of improperly storing transcripts of the president\u2019s phone calls in a system meant for highly classified intelligence secrets, including a conversation with the president of Ukraine that has set off a spiraling impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
