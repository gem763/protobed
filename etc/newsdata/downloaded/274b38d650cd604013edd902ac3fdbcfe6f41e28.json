We\u2019re at risk at any time.\u201d\n\nOver the fiscal year that ended September 30, the Border Patrol apprehended 859,510 migrants attempting to cross the U.S.\u2013Mexico border illegally, as well as more than 110,000 people attempting to enter legally but who were deemed inadmissible.\n\nThe situation came to a head in May, when arrests between ports of entry increased for the fourth straight month to 132,887, up from 99,304 arrests in April.\n\nIllegal border crossings spiked to similar or higher levels in the early 2000s, but most of those migrants were single Mexican men who were easier to deport than the thousands of Central American families, many with young children, who have fled poverty and violence in their home countries and showed up at the U.S. border in recent years.\n\nHastings offered praise for the job immigration agents have done handling the unprecedented circumstances.\n\n\u201cI am incredibly proud of the agents,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cThey have been vilified, but they deserve to be thanked because we have never, ever dealt with anything like this before.\u201d\n\nThe administration has attracted fierce criticism for its hardline immigration policies, including several that have been blocked by courts. Federal courts have issued conflicting rulings on the administration\u2019s \u201csafe third country\u201d rule, which would deny entry to asylum seekers who passed through a third country without seeking asylum there first. Another rule requiring migrants to wait in Mexico while their asylum claims are adjudicated has also been challenged.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said in August that border crossings have declined 43 percent since May and that DHS is working with Central American countries to conduct an \u201caggressive effort against human smugglers\u201d and protect migrants who need asylum.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "A senior Border Patrol official is warning that the immigration situation at the southern border could return to \"crisis level\" if courts block\u00a0Trump administration policies intended to deter heavy flows of migrants attempting to enter the country illegally.\u201cWe will go back, mark the words,", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0YOy4x3LOaf70Sfzp1j3rA--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/1942fe033f4ab8b5fcf15f3435232c00", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
