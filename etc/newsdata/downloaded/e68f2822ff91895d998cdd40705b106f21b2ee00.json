Trump himself, with his background in real estate development, applauded the North\u2019s tourism potential after his first summit with Kim in Singapore last year, specifically referring to its \u201cgreat beaches,\u201d which he said would make for ideal venues for condos.While it is unknown how the North\u2019s envoys responded to the offer in Sweden, Kim Myong-gil, Pyongyang\u2019s top negotiator in the talks, announced shortly after the meeting that the discussions had fallen apart because Washington had not relented from its \u201cold viewpoint and attitude\u201d that the North undertakes denuclearization first before receiving any economic concessions. David Stilwell, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, testified at a Senate hearing last week that the United States will need to \u201cencourage [North Korea] to continue\u201d diplomatic engagement, namely by considering arrangements that could address the regime\u2019s security interests, though he appeared to rule out sanctions relief.\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing that North Korea thinks about,\u201d Stilwell said, in reference to the North\u2019s fixation with its security. \u201cA lot of these other things that they throw out there are distracters, leverage in some form.\u201dBY SHIM KYU-SEOK [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/22195411.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
