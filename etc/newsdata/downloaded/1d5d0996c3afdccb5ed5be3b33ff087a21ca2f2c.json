Like Adichie, Nyong\u2019o didn\u2019t experience discrimination on the basis of her skin colour per se, but on the basis of how dark she was comparatively. She was a victim of one of the last openly accepted \u201cisms\u201d: colourism, the preferential treatment of lighter-skinned individuals compared with their darker-skinned counterparts.\n\nNyong\u2019o referred to colourism as \u201cthe daughter of racism\u201d, explaining that she was once told at an audition that she was \u201ctoo dark\u201d for television.\n\nSkin-tone-based prejudice used to be a subject only discussed in whispers within minority communities, but slowly, and thankfully, that is changing. In a recent episode of the hit Channel 4 series Black-ish \u2013 Black Like Us \u2013 two lead characters discover that the lighting used for their daughter\u2019s school photograph didn\u2019t work on black skin tones, and she has faded into the shadows. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s ode to dark skin on the Lion King soundtrack, Brown Skin Girl, has also helped colourism increase its visibility in the mainstream.\n\nColourism is a seed that was planted by white supremacy\n\nThis is a conversation that is still burgeoning \u2013 and not always taken seriouslyd. Perhaps that is because colourism is perceived as an intra-community issue for minorities to bicker about among ourselves. After all, the general consensus is that it\u2019s only we who bother with the specificity of shade-based bigotry.\n\nBut it bears repeating: colourism is a seed that was planted by white supremacy and watered within our own communities. Its roots still lie very much in the mainstream: the idea that we live on a colour-coded spectrum in which the lighter you are, the whiter (and therefore, better) you are is replicated in wider, whiter society every day.\n\nFrom the overrepresentation of lighter-skinned actresses in Hollywood to the near-invisibility of dark-skinned female musicians, darker skin is quietly denigrated outside our communities too. It\u2019s no coincidence that several historic \u201cfirsts\u201d for the black community were achieved by mixed-raced, fairer individuals: Barack Obama, the first black president of the US; Vanessa Williams, the first black Miss America; Lana Ogilvie, the first black woman to become the face of a non-ethnic cosmetics brand; Halle Berry, the first black woman to win the Academy Award for best actress.\n\nSkin tone affects employability rates, the likelihood of marriage and, most harrowingly, rates of suspension at school. With women\u2019s worth so heavily tied to appearance and lighter skin so heavily tied to beauty standards, it is not surprising that it is usually black women who are hit hardest. The word colourism is believed to have been coined in 1982 by the Pulitzer prize-winner Alice Walker, but it has existed as long as racism has. It must be acknowledged, like any other form of discrimination.", "description": "Thanks to outspoken celebrities like Lupita Nyong\u2019o, the discrimination faced by darker-skinned black people is finally being noticed.
