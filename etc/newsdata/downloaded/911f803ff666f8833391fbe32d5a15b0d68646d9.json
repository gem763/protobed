No doubt that the Nifty 50 showed a bouncing move on Tuesday amid growing expectation of easing measures, and once again experience another upward move up to the levels of 11,883.90 before moving down at the current levels; looks evident enough to show the extension of exhaustion which may turn in a heavy sell-off bout.\n\nI find that the Beijing's refusal to spell out farm buys may create a big hurdle in upcoming final resolution to sign a partial deal in mid of November 2019; which has already been at the verge of further delay; which capped the bullish sentiments in U.S. equity markets on Tuesday.\n\nI expressed my doubts over the may extend bearishness; because this Sino-U.S. tariff trade tussle has already damaged most of the economies of the world.
