The time is out.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t, and though Broncos fans will spend a week debating whether they got robbed by the refs or their own timekeeper, they\u2019ll also have to consider an offense that has mustered two touchdowns and two weeks and a much-hyped defense that has played just well enough to lose.\n\nThe loss dropped Denver to 0-2 for the first time since 1999, and the ending is one that will be dissected for a while.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a part of something like that,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. That\u2019s insane.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start with what transpired with 31 seconds remaining after the Broncos scored on Emmanuel Sanders\u2019 7-yards catch to bring the Broncos to within 13-12. Broncos coach Vic Fangio, who designed the NFL\u2019s best defense in Chicago the last four seasons, elected to go for the win and sent in a play for a 2-point conversion.\n\nBut then QB Joe Flacco couldn\u2019t get the play off in time. The ball was set to be moved back to the 7 yard line.\n\nChange of mind, part I: The Broncos would go for the tie and kick the extra point after the penalty was assessed. Brandon McManus missed a 37-yard try wide right and the Bears began to celebrate.\n\nOnly, Chicago defensive back Buster Skrine jumped offsides on the kick.\n\nChange of mind, part II: Fangio decided to go for 2 again, from the 1, and sent the offense back out. Flacco hit Sanders on a short pass to make it 14-13.\n\nBut the Bears had ample time and one timeout. With 9 seconds remaining and facing fourth-and-15, Trubisky scrambled and found Robinson in the middle of the field for the first down. Robinson instantly fell to the ground to stop the clock.\n\nHowever, it read all zeroes and the Broncos faithful began to cheer.\n\nTurns out, it really didn\u2019t hit all zeroes as the Bears called their final timeout just before time expired. Eddy Pineiro trotted out and sent the kick through the uprights. He was mobbed by teammates.\n\nThe Bears had been looking for a kicker since cutting Cody Parkey following his \u201cdouble-doink\u201d field goal miss of 43 yards in their 16-15 playoff loss to the Philadelphia Eagles a season ago.\n\nThey might have just found their kicker. The Broncos simply found heartache.\n\n\u201cCrazy how we lost that game,\u201d Broncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr. said. \u201cWe fought hard the whole game to get back and get the lead and to lose it like that? It definitely hurts.\u201d\n\nDenver pass rusher Bradley Chubb had a slightly different take.\n\n\u201cWe put the game in their hands,\u201d said Chubb, who was called for a roughing the passer penalty on the decisive drive. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to handle it earlier. We didn\u2019t do that. We let it come down to them and they won.\u201d\n\nFor Flacco, there\u2019s only one thing to do - move on.\n\n\u201cWhen I walk into the building (Monday), I am going to have my head up just as high as I\u2019ve always had,\u201d Flacco said. \u201cGuys see that. Guys respond to that. If I walk into the building and guys see me with my head hanging low, they\u2019re going to say, \u2018Oh yeah, I can feel sorry myself, too.\u2019 And the next guy is going to see that and say, \u2018Oh yeah, I think I should probably feel sorry for myself.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no feeling sorry for yourself.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "What could've been a wild win instead turned into a big-time downer for the Denver Broncos.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pat Graham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/bears_broncos_football_40294_c0-163-3905-2439_s1770x1032.jpg?761b882bb4c7277dd15d46ab38a624c6dee7e4a4", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
