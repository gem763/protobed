Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) has some killer golf skills. Literally.\n\nDuring a United Food and Commercial Workers forum in Madison Heights, Michigan, on Sunday, the 2020 presidential candidate revealed that she once struck a duck when her shot on the green went awry.\n\n\u201cI have played mini golf a lot with my family, but I misfired on the first try and the ball hit a duck in the head, and it appeared to perish,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think it is a good idea for the bird population of America if I would play golf.\u201d\n\nAfter her talk, Klobuchar assured voters on Twitter that if elected, she wouldn\u2019t spend her days on the links like President Donald Trump, who has spent more than 200 days at his Trump-branded golf resorts since taking office, according to a New York Times tally.\n\n\u201cThis is good news for the American people and ducks,\u201d she added.\n\nIf elected President, I promise I won\u2019t spend 200+ days at a golf resort. (This is good news for the American people and ducks.) https://t.co/OaRgrd3Z1d \u2014 Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) September 29, 2019\n\nEarlier this month, UFCW announced its Michigan event in addition to a second forum to be held on Oct. 13 in Des Moines, Iowa. Other candidates confirmed to speak are South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); and Montana Gov.
