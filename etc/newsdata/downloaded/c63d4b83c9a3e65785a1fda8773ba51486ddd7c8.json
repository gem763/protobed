So even that is something we can interpret differently.\"\n\nIn his interview with Carlson, Glezman said his critique is not politically-motivated.\n\n\"Politics is secondary to me,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I'm about sharing the good news of Christ, and I hope all people watching this ... as these Democrat debates come up here in a couple of days ... that people would stop and actually think. We're not talking about just a little blob of cells, we're talking about human life.\n\n\"We are commanded by Christ himself to uphold the dignity and respect of all human life. We need to stand for all the born and all the unborn.\"", "description": "The brother-in-law of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said the South Bend, Ind., mayor should reconsider his view of abortion, in an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/IND-Pete-Buttigieg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
