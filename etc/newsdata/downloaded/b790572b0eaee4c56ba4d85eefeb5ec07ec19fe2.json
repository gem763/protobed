Monaco jumped to eighth with the win, just four points behind their opponents in second and one point off top four.\n\nThe principality side, who have now won four in five, travel to St Etienne on the third of November while Nantes travel to Bordeaux on the same day.\n\nBen Yedder tied Nicolas Pallois and Fabio in knots, forcing the latter off injured, before scoring", "description": "After a sketchy start to the season, Monaco have climbed the table and came into this game with the knowledge that they have lost just once in their last 12 meetings with the high-flying Bretons.", "authors": ["Leigh Mcmanus For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20196400-0-image-a-13_1572035444128.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
