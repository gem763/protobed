REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri\n\nDespite being the world\u2019s top-ranked test side India have struggled with their opening combination, which, in turn, has heaped pressure on the middle order.\n\nSince 2018 KL Rahul, Murali Vijay, Shikhar Dhawan, Parthiv Patel, Prithvi Shaw, Mayank Agarwal and Hanuma Vihari have all opened in tests but none have been able to cement their spot.\n\nExperienced duo Dhawan and Vijay are not expected to be considered after repeated failures while Prithvi Shaw is currently serving a doping ban.\n\nRahul has played 36 tests but failed to score a half-century in his last seven matches while his opening partner in West Indies, Mayank Agarwal, has just four tests under his belt.\n\nWith Ajinkya Rahane and Vihari putting in solid performances in the middle order in two tests against the West Indies, Rohit Sharma has had to sit out, prompting calls to try the limited-overs opener at the top of the order in the longest format too.\n\n\u201cAs selection committee, we haven\u2019t met after the conclusion of the West Indies tour. We will definitely take this (Rohit as opener) point into consideration when we all meet and discuss about it,\u201d India\u2019s chief selector MSK Prasad told India Today.\n\n\u201cKL is definitely a great talent. Of course, he is going through a bit of a tough time in test cricket and we are definitely concerned about his form. He needs to spend more time on the wicket and regain his touch and form.\u201d\n\nRohit, 32, has secured his place at the top of the order in the Twenty20 and 50-over formats and finished with the most runs at the recent World Cup in England.\n\nThe only player in the world with three double hundreds in one-day internationals, Rohit bats in the middle order in the longest format but has never really flourished on the test stage.\n\nHe was dropped following a poor return in South Africa in early 2018 when he scored 78 runs in four innings. He played two tests in a four-match series in Australia at the end of the year, missing one match with injury and another due to the birth of his child.\n\nVirat Kohli\u2019s side should not see too many changes in the rest of the batting order while the bowling unit, which led them to a 2-0 win against the West Indies and to the top of the World Test Championship table with 120 points, should also remain mostly intact.\n\nVishakhapatnam will host the first test between India and South Africa from Oct. 2 followed by matches at Pune and Ranchi.", "description": "Finding a solution to India's top-order batting conundrum will be top of selectors' agenda when they meet on Thursday to pick the squad for next month's home test series against South Africa.", "authors": ["Sudipto Ganguly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428636590&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0O5", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
