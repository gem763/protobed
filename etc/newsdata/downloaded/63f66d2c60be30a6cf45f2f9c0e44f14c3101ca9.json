They waited on Tommy Kahnle for a moment, allowing the human can of Red Bull to join in on the fun after he had earlier done his best Stone Cold Steve Austin impression, dousing himself while drinking from two Champagne bottles simultaneously.\n\nEventually, they all settled down and posed for some cameras while Aaron Judge uncorked a bottle of bubbly and started spraying it.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDespite all the injuries and setbacks, the Yankees once again are atop the AL East.\n\n\u201cThis team, we\u2019re hungry,\u201d Judge said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for some more.\u201d\n\nThe postseason-bound Yankees celebrate after winning the American League East on Thursday night in the Bronx. (USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThis celebratory scene that followed the Yankees\u2019 9-1 win over the Angels marked a stark contrast to the pregame scene in the aftermath of Domingo German being placed on administrative leave due to an alleged domestic violence incident.\n\nMLB announced its investigation about an hour and a half before the Yankees\u2019 clubhouse opened, and the clubhouse was quiet and sparse. The team later skipped batting practice with the field instead being occupied by the pitchers.\n\nYankees manager Aaron Boone and general manager Brian Cashman addressed the team before the game in what Boone described as a \u201ccandid\u201d conversation.\n\nThe Yankees will wait to learn German\u2019s fate, but sources told Yahoo Sports that the team is preparing as if the righty will not be part of their roster.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult situation that none of us really know that many details about,\u201d Boone said following Thursday\u2019s win. \u201cSo you just try and lay it out. Sometimes things come up over the course of a season that you\u2019re not necessarily prepared for, and you just try to talk through it the best you can.\u201d\n\nTommy Kahnle was the life of the clubhouse party. (Getty Images)\n\nGerman cannot be with the team while on administrative leave, and thus was not involved in the postgame celebrations that came a day later than anticipated.\n\nAfter entering Wednesday with a magic number of one, the Bronx Bombers fell to the Angels, 3-2. The entire team stayed at Yankee Stadium to see if the Dodgers could top the Rays, and allow them to celebrate anyway.\n\nThe clubhouse was covered in plastic. Goggles were close by, ready to be worn.\n\nBut close to 1 a.m. ET Thursday, the Rays completed a come-from-behind 8-7 victory in 11 innings at Dodger Stadium, leaving the Bombers in the same spot.\n\n\u201cWe were ready to go,\u201d Boone said. \u201cHopefully we have better luck tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees certainly did have better luck Thursday.\n\nAL MVP candidate D.J. LeMahieu provided early offense with a two-out, three-run homer in the second that gave the Yankees a 3-0 lead.\n\nAnd that was more than enough run support for Masahiro Tanaka, who cruised through seven innings of one-run ball on an economical 86 pitches.\n\nAfter closer Aroldis Chapman recorded the final out, the Yankees showed little emotion on the field \u2014 their handshake line business-like \u2014 before pouring into the clubhouse and pouring bubbly all over one another.\n\nAs media members entered, Boone stood near the entranceway, watching from afar as his players enjoyed this notable achievement. The clubhouse was covered in plastic to prevent the booze from staining the carpet.\n\nPlayers wore postseason hats and shirts while celebrating with Judge even spraying some members of the media with Champagne.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d said Judge, limited to 96 games due to injuries. \u201cWe\u2019re going to celebrate tonight and have fun with it. A long season, lots of ups and downs, enjoy it tonight but we got a lot more baseball to play.\u201d\n\nAs songs from Travis Scott, Drake, YG and others blasted, the players transitioned between interviews and celebrating with their teammates.\n\nKahnle certainly had a fun time while engaging with fellow pitchers, who doused him with Champagne at one moment.\n\nThe carpet felt almost like a slip-n-slide with one Yankee yelling out how everyone\u2019s shoes were fighting a losing battle.\n\nAnd, yes, there were plenty of selfies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great year, with all the injuries and stuff, guys just kept stepping up. We\u2019re just a bunch of savages,\u201d first baseman Luke Voit said. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThursday marked what the Yankees hope is the first of four celebrations in September and October, culminating in their 28th World Series title.\n\n\u201cAfter what happened to us last year, Boston had a great year, but we got back our confidence. Got something to prove,\u201d Voit said. \u201cIt\u2019s a stepping stone for what we want to happen and I can\u2019t wait to go to war with these guys.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Hours after Domingo German was placed on administrative leave for  an alleged domestic violence incident, the Yankees won the AL East.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UD96Md0jtruJhidB9BCnPQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/u8PW2R0WwTPmkz5r7DZePg--~B/aD0zMTg5O3c9NDc4MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/5d636c80-db59-11e9-aff7-3c044e211f9c", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
