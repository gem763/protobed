Beto O\u2019Rourke launched his 2020 run with a gauzy Vanity Fair cover where he\u2019s flanked by his family\u2019s black lab, Artemis. (\u201cYou can call me #DOTUS,\u201d proclaims the bio for Artemis\u2019s Twitter account, @First_Dog_USA. )\n\nJill and Joe Biden adopted a rescue dog last November. And a whole host of other candidates\u2014from Pete Buttigieg to Tim Ryan\u2014pictures of their own pets (Buddy and Truman for the Buttigieg family; the aptly named Buckeye and Bear for Ryan\u2019s family).\n\nBy showcasing their pets, candidates are perhaps trying to paint themselves as something more than out-of-reach politicians who talk at you about tax rates, health insurance, and electability (whatever that means).\n\nBut one frontrunner doesn\u2019t want to participate in the doggie circus: \u201cIf you want somebody who\u2019s going to talk about their cooking, their dog, their wardrobe, travel habits, or favorite books,\u201d an adviser told the New York Times this summer, \u201cBernie Sanders is not your candidate.\u201d\n\n\u2014Saahil Desai\n\n*\n\nSnapshot\n\nThe climate activist Greta Thunberg bumps fists with former President Barack Obama during her visit to Washington, D.C.

There\u2019s precedent for Congress reviewing the president\u2019s picks for appointed positions, John Gans writes, and that congressional scrutiny would ensure ideologues don\u2019t sink a president\u2019s national-security team.\n\nCorey was in the House: If you missed the former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski\u2019s testimony before the House Judiciary Committee yesterday, Russell Berman sums it up: He came to mock Democrats, crack jokes, and show his loyalty to Trump. Meanwhile, he\u2019s reportedly eyeing a Senate run in New Hampshire.\n\nOur Reporters Are Also Reading\n\n\n\n\u2023 21st-Century Breakup: Inside the Divorce Rattling Silicon Valley and Democratic Politics.
