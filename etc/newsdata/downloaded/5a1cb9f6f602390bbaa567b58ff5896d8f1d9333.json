Maputo, who predicts a \u201cstraightforward victory\u201d.\n\nMost of Mozambique\u2019s 13 million registered voters were born after Frelimo came to power in 1975. The youth of voters has played a significant role in undermining support for ruling parties that seized power across Africa in the aftermath of struggles against colonial regimes.\n\nCarlos Alberto, a 22-year-old student waiting to vote, said he wanted to see reforms in education, employment and housing. \u201cWe vote and then nothing happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make changes.\u201d\n\nRenamo is predicted to win between three to five of Mozambique\u2019s 10 provinces for the first time, following a change in the law allowing voters to elect provincial governors. The party made gains in last year\u2019s municipal elections, winning eight town halls.\n\nRenamo\u2019s candidate, Ossufo Momade, 58, heads a party of former anti-communist rebels who fought a brutal civil war with Frelimo from 1975 to 1992, devastating the economy and leaving almost 1 million people dead.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ossufo Momade, president of Renamo, waves to supporters at a rally in Nampula.

It may even lead to confrontation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe six-week election campaign was one of the most violent in the country\u2019s turbulent history, with candidates threatened, election material destroyed, and deadly clashes breaking out.\n\nThe opposition has already accused Frelimo of tampering with the vote. Enrolment has more than doubled in the south-eastern Gaza province, a Frelimo bastion.\n\nLast week, the head of a local election observation mission was shot dead by members of a special police unit in Gaza\u2019s capital, Xai-Xai.\n\nLutero Simango, an MP for the country\u2019s third biggest party, MDM, accused Frelimo of \u201cusing all state means, including police and secret services, to intimidate people\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People queue to cast their votes in Matola, Mozambique, on Tuesday.

Economic growth is estimated at about 2%, well below the average of previous years and the lowest level since 2000.\n\nA complex insurgency by a little-known group of Islamic extremists in the far northern Muslim-majority Cabo Delgado province has killed more than 300 people and delayed the development of vast gas reserves that is hoped to put billions in state coffers and lift millions out of poverty.\n\nTwelve people were killed in an attack on a village last month by extremists. The government said nine \u201cevildoers\u201d had died in a military operation last week.", "description": "Ruling Frelimo party expected to beat arch-rival Renamo after campaign marred by violence", "authors": ["Jason Burke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae5359f15540246543478e5ed7869cbbe96f27bc/0_219_4150_2490/master/4150.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=08c447ca4143ad2d6dc629ac45721539", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
