Reed\u2019s helmet popped off, and everything stopped: Coach Jay Gruden confirmed Reed was in concussion protocol.\n\nReed only now looks ready to play after his fifth documented concussion in seven NFL seasons and seventh dating to his time at Florida. He\u2019s still limited in practice, but the 29-year-old is on pace to make his season debut Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n\u201cHe did a lot of team (drills) today, which is good,\u201d Gruden said Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s just got to continue to get more reps, and then we\u2019ll continue to monitor how he\u2019s feeling afterward.\u201d\n\nReed declined to talk after practice Wednesday other than to nod at reporters to tell them he was doing well. If he gets on the field Sunday, he\u2019ll have a chance to live up to his training camp mantra of \u201cactions speak louder than words\u201d to show he can stay healthy.\n\nThere\u2019s no faulting Reed for this injury, and bad luck played a role in previous shoulder, hip, ankle and foot problems. They all seemed to be behind him based on stellar practices in offseason workouts and training camp and provided a tantalizing glimpse of what Reed could do at 100 percent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a special player,\u201d starting quarterback Case Keenum said. \u201cI haven\u2019t played with many players like him. I\u2019ve never played with a player that can do what he does. I\u2019m excited to get him back out there.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins could use Reed right about now with other injuries piling up. Defensive lineman Jonathan Allen is week to week with a knee injury, running back Derrius Guice injured his right knee 13 months after tearing the ACL on the other knee and safety Montae Nicholson missed practice with a strained foot.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t even count the continued absence of holdout left tackle Trent Williams. Washington is desperate to avoid an 0-2 start - both in the NFC East - but Gruden insists every precaution will be taken with Reed until he\u2019s ready.\n\n\u201cWe would never put Jordan at risk any time, any place, if we thought there was going to be a future problem,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cBut once he gets cleared and he feels good enough to go, he\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Reed only now looks ready to play after his fifth documented concussion in seven NFL seasons and seventh dating to his time at Florida.
