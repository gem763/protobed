Photo: Kevin Tachman\n\nThe scent of Chanel was in the air. Last night in West Hollywood, leading ladies and ingenues alike alighted on the Bar Marmont for an evening celebrating Chanel\u2019s new fragrance, Gabrielle Chanel Essence. The notes: tuberose, jasmine, ylang ylang, and orange blossom. The face: Margot Robbie, who, fresh off playing Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino\u2019s alternative history of the Manson era, held court in an ivory ruffled top and black feather-embellished pants from the house\u2019s couture collection.\n\nWhile making her rounds, Robbie took a moment to discuss fragrance-application techniques and all things olfactory with the Cut. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not doing it wrong,\u201d she said with a laugh when asked how she applies her Gabrielle Chanel Essence. \u201cI spray it on my wrists and then I spray it kind of on my neck. Is that how you guys do it?\u201d After some discussion of the \u201cspray-and-prance-through\u201d method, Robbie was inspired. \u201cI feel like it might be more fun to do it that way, but I feel like I\u2019d get less of the perfume on me,\u201d she ruminated. \u201cI might try that next time, just for fun.\u201d As for her favorite smell in the world? \u201cI\u2019m going to sound very whimsical, but I like the smell just after it rains,\u201d Robbie said. \u201cI feel like it has a very distinct smell. It rarely rains in L.A., so thunderstorms are something I miss about home.\u201d\n\nThe Haim sisters, all in Chanel, posed for pictures together before greeting friends, while Euphoria\u2019s Maude Apatow casually dodged interviews in a winning fuchsia Chanel sweater, which she tucked into belted high-waisted jeans. What do the characters on Euphoria smell like? The Cut was keen to find out \u2014 but that will have to wait for another occasion.\n\nAfter the attendees \u2014 Rainey Qualley, Dree Hemingway, and Harley Viera-Newton among them \u2014 filtered in, everyone made their way poolside, where musician and Bob Marley granddaughter Zuri Marley presided over the DJ booth in a pink tweed Chanel jacket and long tables were festooned with white flower arrangements and charcuterie.\n\nFrom left: Photo: Kevin Tachman Photo: Kevin Tachman From top: Photo: Kevin Tachman Photo: Kevin Tachman\n\nAs the first course \u2014 heirloom tomatoes with burrata \u2014 was served, Robbie made a toast, thanking Chanel In-House Perfumer Creator Olivier Polge, \u201cNot just because he flew all the way from Paris just to be here, just for dinner, but because he invented and created this amazing perfume.\u201d She continued, \u201cIt is such an incredible honor to represent this fragrance, because it bears the name of an incredible woman, Gabrielle Chanel, who I admire greatly, because she invented her own destiny and she kind of changed the world forever by creating the house of Chanel. So, I\u2019d also like to thank the house of Chanel.\u201d\n\nAnd as the night progressed, Shaed took to the proverbial stage to play a trio of songs, including the hit \u201cTrampoline,\u201d while guests including Rachel Zoe (clad in sequins) and fellow musican Yuna (stunning in a head wrap) whipped out their phones to preserve the moment in their Instagram stories.\n\nOn the way out, guest were invited to take home the new Gabrielle Chanel Essence fragrance, so they too can smell like the fashion legend \u2014 or Margot Robbie.\n\nOnce upon a time in Hollywood, indeed.", "description": "Inside the star-studded launch for the Gabrielle Chanel Essence fragrance.
