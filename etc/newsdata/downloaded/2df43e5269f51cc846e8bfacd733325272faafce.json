After months of prodding, the Fed finally gave President Donald Trump what he\u2019d wanted for months \u2014 lower interest rates.\n\nThe stage appeared set for a great August for financial markets. Instead, the last full month of summer was a headache for investors.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a Tariff problem (we are reigning in bad and/or unfair players), we have a Fed problem,\u201d Trump tweeted last Friday. Adding in a follow up tweet: \u201cIf the Fed would cut, we would have one of the biggest Stock Market increases in a long time.\u201d\n\nThese were just two of the more than 25 tweets Trump published in August about the Federal Reserve. Almost once a day last month, Trump complained that his most important political appointee was letting him down.\n\nFor the most part, financial markets have ignored Trump\u2019s incessant complaints about the Fed. Trump calling the Fed chair an enemy has not resulted in stock prices going up or down a lot. The market has accepted the Fed\u2019s insistence that politics play no role in its policymaking at face value. It is better than the alternative. (And it\u2019s why the blowback to Bill Dudley\u2019s column last week was swift and universal.)\n\nIt is also exhausting and sort of boring to follow each complaint Trump lobs at Powell. What the president wants is for stocks to go up in a straight line. Trump thinks the Fed is what stands in the way of that, not his trade war with China. That\u2019s the long and the short of it. Whether Trump calls Powell a bad golfer or implores the central bank to \u201cshow their stuff\u201d doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nBut what I think investors should keep in mind when it comes to Trump\u2019s attacks on Powell is that this is his guy, even if he regrets the choice. Trump could\u2019ve nominated Janet Yellen for another term as Fed chair. Or he could\u2019ve nominated Kevin Warsh. Or Gary Cohn. Instead he picked Powell, and he believes he has been let down.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine, however, that any of these other nominees would\u2019ve made Trump happier. A recurring theme of Trump\u2019s presidency is that there is always someone else to blame: The media. Paul Ryan. Jay Powell. Xi Jinping.\n\nAnd so while many investors and strategists still believe that a trade deal with China \u201cwill get done,\u201d it\u2019s not clear why. Because an assumption that a trade deal \u201cwill get done\u201d is really an assumption that Trump will finally be satisfied. That nothing else will stand in the way of the best economy and stock market ever. That Trump will no longer tweet things that make stocks go down. That he will no longer, in essence, be himself.\n\nThe \u201cTrump will make a deal on trade\u201d story is becoming the oldest pitch in the Trump era playbook for investors. But it\u2019s also the most unrealistic. It assumes the president is someone he\u2019s not.\n\nBy Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
