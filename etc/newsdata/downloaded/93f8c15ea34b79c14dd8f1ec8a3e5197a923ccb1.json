There's also a health and safety aspect of it - protecting the backs of the people who have to lift out the floor every time we have a meeting.\"\n\nBut Lee Holmes, Conservative councillor for Skelton West, said: \"They have systematically wasted thousands of pounds worth of taxpayers' money paying a removal company to alter the main council chamber for full meetings.\n\n\"In my opinion this is a disgraceful waste of money.\"\n\nEarlier this year the cash-strapped council scrapped the role of chief executive in a cost-cutting move.\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
