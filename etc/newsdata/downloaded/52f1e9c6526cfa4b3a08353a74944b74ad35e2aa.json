And the unbeaten Barber (8-0 MMA, 3-0 UFC) added a significant name to her list on Friday night when she ran through the previously red-hot Gillian Robertson at UFC on ESPN 6.\n\nThe time of the TKO stoppage in the flyweight main-card opener at TD Garden in Boston was 3:04 of the opening round.\n\n\u201cI feel great. I have a lot of respect for Gillian. She was the first person who tried to speak up and start some drama, so give it up for her. She really wanted to come out here and win the fight,\u201d said Barber, who asked for a fight with Paige VanZant during her post-fight interview.\n\nAfter a brief feeling-out process, Robertson (7-3 MMA, 4-1 UFC) pulled guard. That led to a brief scramble on the ground and a clinch along the fence.\n\nBut that\u2019s when Barber created some space and landed big haymakers. One uncontested shot after another found the mark. Robertson briefly managed to escape, only to have Barber catch up and land precise elbows until the fight was waved off.\n\nAll three of Barber\u2019s official UFC wins, as well as a Contender Series victory, have come via TKO. Robertson, who had won four of her five previous UFC fights, suffered her second career stoppage loss.\n\nGallery Maycee Barber def.
