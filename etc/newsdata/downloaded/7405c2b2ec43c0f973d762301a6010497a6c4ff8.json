They have to tolerate limited legroom, tiny toilets and overhead-bin space jams.\n\nBut as more travelers bring screens onto planes and airlines offer more in-flight entertainment, throwing shade on open-window enthusiasts has become more common.\n\nAirlines and travelers say the proliferation of individual devices has led to more pressure to stay dark. More narrow-body planes have joined wide-body jets in offering individual entertainment system screens on the backs of seats.\n\nMany daytime flights cruise in cabin darkness to avoid glare and allow sleep. Some travelers say they have switched seating preference from aisle seats to window seats to control the shade\u2014either up or down.\n\nFor some travelers, gazing out the window is a serene way to pass the time on an airplane. But increasingly passengers want the shades closed to reduce glare on all the screens they are bringing onboard.

His in-flight entertainment is looking out the window.\n\nOn some daylight Boeing 787 trips, passengers report flight attendants routinely darken all windows right after takeoff and cut off individual controls. On hot days, airlines ask passengers to close shades to keep cabins cooler on the ground. And they never get opened.\n\nEven Federal Aviation Administration inspectors have noticed, says agency spokesman Lynn Lunsford. \u201cIt seems that many passengers simply leave the window shades in the lowered position for the next flight,\u201d he says.\n\nThe FAA has no regulations on shades up or down, though many countries require windows in exit rows to be clear for takeoff and landing, when an accident could jam a closed shade and prevent passengers from seeing if they were opening an emergency door into fire.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nIn the past, it might have been all shades down during a movie when everyone watched the same movie at the same time. Then shades went up when the movie ended. Now the viewing is constant, as is the squinting.\n\nMembers of the light brigade suggest that passengers who want to sleep should use eyeshades during daytime flights.\n\nBut those on the dark side counter that you can\u2019t watch a movie with eyeshades on. If you need light, they say, you have one: your overhead reading light.\n\nAnd those who like looking out the window retort that the view isn\u2019t so interesting with the shade fully closed.\n\nJim Hayes Jr. , a toy and novelty buyer from Saginaw, Mich., flies several times a year to Asia and wants to sleep, watch movies or use his iPad on the plane. Sunlight can be wicked from even one window, he says, especially when reflecting off clouds or ice below on routes that fly near the North Pole.\n\nBut it can happen on any flight. One time flying from Florida to Chicago at sunset, direct sunlight came screaming into his eyes, he says. A flight attendant saw several passengers struggling to block it and asked a woman seated by the offending window to lower the shade. She refused.\n\nMr. Hayes thinks it\u2019s a matter of airplane etiquette: Passengers should go with the collective good. \u201cIf everyone else has it closed, why do you have to be the one person?\u201d he says. \u201cI personally think it\u2019s a bit selfish.\u201d\n\nNow he wears sunglasses in the cabin and a hoodie on long flights so he can cover his eyes. Business-class seats shaped as pods with high walls help, he says.\n\nFor some people, light is important to keep your body clock on a schedule and counter jet lag. And some travelers say if all shades are closed, the sardine can that is a coach cabin feels more unsettled, even claustrophobic.\n\nAnd for many, watching the world go by makes the flight more enjoyable. Michael Hyman, a New Jersey-based sales rep for a global consulting firm, took United\u2019s Island Hopper flight from Honolulu to Guam with stops at beautiful atolls, islands and green water. He wanted to take pictures out the window. Another passenger watching a movie asked him to close the shade.\n\n\u201cOne of my main motivations taking the Island Hopper was picture-taking,\u201d Mr. Hyman says. He partially closed the shade as best he could, unhappily. \u201cI always try to be a good seatmate,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Hyman thinks the power breakdown for airplane seating goes like this:\n\n* The window seat passenger gets to control the window shade.\n\n* The middle-seat passenger gets the armrests.\n\n* The aisle-seat flier gets the most freedom of movement.\n\nLight has become a bigger issue for fliers not only because of more screens but also because of more seats being packed into cabins, Mr. Hyman says. Dark cabins encourage sleep, and the more people sleep, the easier work becomes for flight attendants, he says.\n\nThe 787 has large windows to give passengers more view. The windows are dimmed electronically. Each window-seat passenger has a control and flight attendants have an override.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you like the window shade up or down? How strongly do you feel about it? Join the conversation below.\n\nAmerican says it tells its flight attendants not to lock out individual passenger control of window dimming on its Boeing 787s. United says it doesn\u2019t have a policy.\n\nPassengers say on many flights, especially daylight trips out of Asia to North America, flight attendants quickly darken the windows and lock out passenger control. They can give back control for a particular window to a passenger who asks.\n\nMr. Zaiser is a public safety supervisor from Bend, Ore., and United frequent flier who\u2019s already accumulated one million miles in his late 30s. He always selects a window seat for the view. But he got a fully dark, locked window on a United flight from Singapore to Los Angeles, nixing his expected views of the southeast Asian coast and Philippines.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but feel a little cheated out of my window-seat selection,\u201d he says.\n\nAirlines say business travelers flying to the U.S. from Asia often want to sleep so they can be fresh when they land.\n\nDelta, which doesn\u2019t fly the 787 but faces ups and downs with manual shades, says it\u2019s been getting comments about the need to go dark and believes that\u2019s a reflection of the airline\u2019s investment in in-flight entertainment systems, now available on about 700 of Delta\u2019s 1,060 aircraft.\n\n\u201cIt underscores how far we have come,\u201d spokesman Morgan Durrant says.\n\nThe airline has seen window-shade spats between passengers resolved with flight attendants arranging trades to move passengers into darkness or light. Nothing shade-related has escalated into serious conflict, Mr. Durrant says.\n\nWrite to Scott McCartney at middleseat@wsj.com", "description": "There\u2019s a new level of tension brewing between passengers who insist on keeping the shades down and those who demand keeping them up to enjoy the view.", "authors": ["Scott Mccartney", "Scott.Mccartney Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107816/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
