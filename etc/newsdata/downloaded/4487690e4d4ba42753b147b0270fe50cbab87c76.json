REUTERS/Jussi Rosendahl/File Photo\n\nSuch a move will be necessary to gain antitrust approval, people familiar with the matter have said. Kone is one of at least 10 potential bidders for Thyssenkrupp\u2019s 15 billion euro ($16.7 billion) lifts business.\n\nThe group has for years been keen to buy Thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology (ET), the world\u2019s No.4 elevator maker.\n\nBut any deal between the two is certain to raise red flags in Brussels, which has already blocked some cross-border deals this year, including a steel joint venture between Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel (TISC.NS).\n\nKone has therefore hired law firm Clifford Chance, a person familiar with the matter said, to work out a plan. This could involve it teaming up with a private equity group that could buy assets in regions where both rivals have dominant positions.\n\nAn acquisition would need approval by European competition authorities, but Kone Chief Executive Henrik Ehrnrooth told Reuters that talks with them would only begin once there was \u201ca real case on their table\u201d.\n\nHe pointed out that the two companies dominate in different geographies, with Kone being strong in Asia while Thyssenkrupp\u2019s best markets are in the Americas.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed selling any of our own assets,\u201d Ehrnrooth said, adding \u201cit could well be that we would have to give up some parts of Thyssenkrupp\u201d.\n\nRelated Coverage Thyssenkrupp should keep high stake in elevator unit: foundation\n\nREMARKABLE SYNERGIES\n\nHe also said that Kone and ET were a perfect fit, listing their different geographic coverage, synergies from overlapping operations and the industry\u2019s digital transformation needs.\n\n\u201cThe main reason why we are doing this is geographic coverage and to obtain more growth,\u201d Ehrnrooth added after Kone earlier reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit.\n\n\u201cWe have said that we are very interested.\u201d\n\nShares in Kone and Thyssenkrupp both closed up 1.4%.\n\nEhrnrooth declined to say what synergies Kone calculates it could squeeze out of merging the two businesses. Danske Bank has estimated that these could be as high as 7 billion euros.\n\n\u201cThe synergies would be quite remarkable,\u201d Ehrnrooth said, adding they would \u201cmean staff cuts in some places but our type of business is geographically very dispersed\u201d.\n\nIt is still unclear what structure any deal could take - or whether Thyssenkrupp will pursue a listing of the unit instead.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe conglomerate\u2019s top shareholder, the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach foundation, said it should not sell too much.\n\n\u201cWith regard to dividend payouts it would certainly be best to keep a stake in Elevator, the profitable business, that is as high as possible,\u201d Ursula Gather, the foundation\u2019s head, told German newspaper Rheinische Post.\n\nGather said it was unrealistic that the foundation, which owns 21% of Thyssenkrupp, could stump up the 350 million euros needed to raise its stake to a blocking minority.", "description": "Kone might sell some parts of Thyssenkrupp's elevator business if the Finnish firm wins an auction to buy it, the CEO of the world's No.3 elevator maker said.", "authors": ["Anne Kauranen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444137567&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1BQ", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
