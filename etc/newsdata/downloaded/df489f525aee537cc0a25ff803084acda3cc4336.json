The allegations were made by Brown's former trainer Britney Taylor in a lawsuit filed in federal court and include an alleged forcible rape in 2018.\n\nThe lawsuit included profane emails confirming at least one of the incidents that were alleged to have come from Brown.\n\nBrown's lawyer Darren Heitner responded with a denial of each count and contended the sex in 2018 was consensual. Deeming the lawsuit as nothing but a \"money grab,\" Heitner said Brown could respond with countersuits against his accuser.\n\nThe Patriots can't be that surprised\n\nBrown's arrival in New England was met with Tom Brady offering up his house for Brown's use and Belichick comparing the signing to the addition of Randy Moss more than a decade earlier.\n\nThe emergence of this story shows the Patriots absorbing Brown into their plans were foolishly shortsighted and not worth the risk of adding someone whose behavior has been consistently erratic.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, maybe you'll say that the Patriots could not have expected charges this severe after the relatively trivial incidents that ran him out of Oakland. But if that endless parade of nonsense from frostbitten feet to threatening the GM taught us anything, it was that anything and everything is on the table with Brown.\n\nAt worst, Brown is guilty of criminal behavior and should never play in the league again. At best, he jeopardized both his reputation and the success of his teams by associating with someone who would resort to extortion.\n\nEither way, this story seems far from over and both sides seem ready to sling as much mud in public as necessary.\n\nThe Patriots, meanwhile, claimed they were 'caught by surprise' by the allegations, and released a tepid no-further-comment statement late Tuesday night. For now, they're stuck in the middle, and there isn't a soul outside of New England who will feel sorry for them as they get pelted.\n\nBe informed all NFL season.
