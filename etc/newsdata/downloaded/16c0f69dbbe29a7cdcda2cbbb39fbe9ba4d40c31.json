Nicolas Pepe started a swift, slick counter attack deep inside his own half and he should have finished it too.\n\nThe attack developed down the left and Sead Kolasinac whipped a pin-point cross into the six-yard box where Pepe was arriving at the far post, but the Ivorian went for the ball with his left foot rather that his right and somehow touched it wide.\n\nThe Blades capitalised on their good fortune after half an hour when Mousset turned the ball home from close range after Jack O\u2019Connell had headed Oliver Norwood\u2019s corner back across goal.\n\nThe hosts could have had a penalty when George Baldock went down under a challenge from Kolasinac, while immediately at the other end Arsenal felt aggrieved for the second time when, rather than point to the penalty spot, referee Dean booked Bukayo Saka for diving after he went to ground following a coming together with Egan.\n\nArsenal assistant coach Freddie Ljungberg was so incensed by the decision that he also received a yellow card for his protests.\n\nDean Henderson ensured his side went into half-time ahead when he pushed away Granit Xhaka\u2019s 30-yard strike in first-half injury time.\n\nArsenal made a change at the break with Dani Ceballos replacing Joe Willock. The Spaniard, on loan from Real Madrid, gave the home defenders something new to think about early in the second half, coming in-field from the left and finding pockets of space.\n\nHe might have equalised after an hour but scuffed his shot from Saka\u2019s cross and, in the end, it was a routine save for Henderson.\n\nAt the other end the Blades remained a threat and Baldock sliced an attempt wide before John Fleck\u2019s driven effort rippled the side-netting, with many inside Bramall Lane thinking it was 2-0.\n\nFleck then hit a swerving shot from long distance that was spilled by Bernd Leno, who managed to regather the ball before the onrushing David McGoldrick could pounce.\n\nEmery brought on the fit-again Alexandre Lacazette, out since September with an ankle injury, midway through the second half, with Xhaka making way.\n\nThe Frenchman soon won a free-kick in a dangerous position just on the edge of the box. Pepe took it but his curling effort over the defensive wall was seen all the way into the hands of Henderson.\n\nThe hosts withstood some pressure late on as the Gunners searched for an equalising goal. Kolasniac headed over the crossbar and Calum Chambers flashed a shot across the face of goal but Chris Wilder\u2019s team saw it out for a deserved win.\n\nPA", "description": "Sheffield United claimed the scalp of Arsenal to move up to ninth in the Premier League with a 1-0 victory at Bramall Lane.
