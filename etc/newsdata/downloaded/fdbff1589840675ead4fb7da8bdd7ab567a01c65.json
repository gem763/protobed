I can't thank you enough for helping me - I can now get rid of the bucket.\"\n\nMrs Knight says she first reported her toilet problem in August when the waste pipe became blocked.\n\nAttempts by workmen to plunge the loo appeared to work - but the problem would always return within two hours.\n\nMrs Knight said Severn Trent investigated the situation with dye but concluded that roots had broken a pipe on her property's side of the public boundary.\n\nSevern Trent had said it would not fix the issue there because the source was not on its land.\n\nWhen a council property is affected, Severn Trent says it is up to the local authority to do the work.\n\nMrs Knight said that despite reporting the issue to Birmingham City Council several times, and having a reference number, the problem was not fixed.\n\n(Image: Darren Quinton/Birmingham Live)\n\nMrs Knight said it was only thanks to the goodwill of her next door neighbour that she had been able to remain living at home for the duration of the blockage.\n\n\"I've been using a bucket and taking it next door to empty it,\" she said.\n\n\"It was wonderful to get up today to know that I wouldn't have to run straight round. I can't believe that workmen have come to fix the blockage.\n\n\"I've lived here for four years and not had a problem before and I do love this house apart from this.\"\n\nMrs Knight said she had to retire because of ill health.\n\nShe said she used to work in mental health but now has arthritis in her knees and as a sufferer of COPD was often at risk of being hospitalised.\n\n\"Every time I've rung up the council, I feel I can't shout at the people at the other end of the phone to do something as I know it's not their fault,\" she said.\n\n\"But I have got a bit angry with them sometimes and I've had to apologise. That's all I could do.\"\n\nBirmingham City Council apologised for not providing Mrs Knight with a portable toilet after discovering that initial attempts to repair the problem were not successful because of 'roots blocking the drainage system'.\n\nIn written statement, the council said: \"We have offered our sincere apologies to Mrs Knight for the circumstances that have left her temporarily without adequate facilities.\n\n\"We have more than 62,000 tenants all of who we aim to provide with a first-class service.\n\n\"On this occasion, we, and the contractor we employ, have fallen short of the standards we would expect and are looking to rectify the situation as soon as possible.\u201d", "description": "Margaret Knight from Birmingham had to visit a neighbour's home daily to empty her bucket of waste", "authors": ["Graham Young", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Bpm Media", "Darren Quinton Birmingham Live"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20640185.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS196019189.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
