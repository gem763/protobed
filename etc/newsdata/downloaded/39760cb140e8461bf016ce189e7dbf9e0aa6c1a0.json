North Korea also has welcomed Trump\u2019s decision to fire hawkish former National Security Adviser John R Bolton, who advocated a \u201cLibya model\u201d of unilateral denuclearization as a template for North Korea.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A senior North Korean diplomat on Tuesday said North Korea and the United States have agreed to resume nuclear negotiations on Oct. 5 following a monthslong stalemate over withdrawal of sanctions in exchange for disarmament.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/north_korea_koreas_typhoon_67501_c0-0-3000-1749_s1770x1032.jpg?4ec8ef4b5df28140b7ab4a06fbd1165bdd086b07", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
