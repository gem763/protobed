Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) at the Power of Our Pride Town Hall on Thursday in Los Angeles.\n\nA man who claimed earlier this week that he had been paid for sex by presidential candidate Kamala Harris now says he was hired for an acting role.\n\nOh, and he claims now that he thought Harris was a fictional person, according to an exclusive interview with the Daily Beast.\n\nOn Wednesday, 26-year-old personal trainer Sean Newaldass participated in a news conference organized by Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, two far-right conspiracy theorists who are already known for pushing fraudulent claims.\n\nNewaldass read from a fact sheet about his alleged relationship with the California senator, which can be seen here, and claimed he and Harris had a total of 11 \u201csexual encounters\u201d in hotels in Iowa; Washington, D.C.; and New York City, according to the Daily Dot.\n\nCheck out this video of the news conference \u2015 which is hilarious in its ineptness.\n\nOn Friday, Newaldass told a much different story than the one he told on Wednesday.\n\nHe said Wohl and Burkman hired him after he answered a CraigsList ad seeking a \u201cmale actor\u201d for \u201cperformance art in DC.\u201d\n\nNewaldass said he believed the news conference was actually an audition for a Spike TV show that no longer exists.\n\nIn fact, he had no clue Harris was a politician, much less a potential presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cI thought I was acting for a role in a movie, like a role in a TV series,\u201d Newaldass told the Daily Beast. \u201cI thought everything was staged, I\u2019m thinking everyone is an actor.\u201d\n\nEven more important: \u201cI\u2019m completely oblivious to who [Harris] is,\u201d Newaldass told the Daily Beast.\n\nLater in the interview, Newaldass admitted he\u2019s researched Harris since the news conference and now says he plans to vote for her.\n\nHowever, Newaldass said he regrets his part in the attempted smear because, like Harris, he is of mixed Indian and Caribbean ancestry.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s hurtful, because I\u2019m hurting my own ethnicity,\u201d Newaldass said.\n\nNewaldass said he was supposed to receive $500 for his services but hasn\u2019t yet.\n\nWhen the Daily Beast reached out to Wohl for his reaction, he responded cryptically with a laughing crying face emoji.\n\nHuffPost reached out to Wohl, but he didn\u2019t immediately respond.\n\nThe smear against Harris was the latest to backfire for Wohl and Burkman.\n\nEarlier this month, the two dirty tricksters attempted to smear Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as a \u201ccougar\u201d by holding a news conference with a former Marine in his mid-20s who claimed he had a paid sexual affair with Warren, 70, that included bondage.\n\nWarren got the last laugh with a witty response that embraced her \u201ccougar\u201d past, telling the world it made her who she is.\n\nIt's always a good day to be reminded that I got where I am because a great education was available for $50 a semester at the University of Houston (go Cougars!). We need to cancel student debt and make college free for everyone who wants it. pic.twitter.com/fHasLm0j9P \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 3, 2019", "description": "Sean Newaldass said he thought the California senator was fictional, but now he plans to vote for her.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da102af20000058075000cb.jpeg?cache=xzizgemzum&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
