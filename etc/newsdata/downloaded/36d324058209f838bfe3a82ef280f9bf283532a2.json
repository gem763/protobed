Last week, reports surfaced indicating that Boeing BA, +1.79% misled regulators about the jets\u2019 safety years before they were involved in two deadly crashes. On Tuesday, the company replaced the leader of its commercial aircraft team as the criticism continued.\n\nCommentary on the Max fallout may overshadow Boeing\u2019s actual financials, but those aren\u2019t expected to be pretty either as the company\u2019s Max jets remain grounded. Analysts are calling for a 46% drop in profits and a 22% decline in revenue for the third quarter. It remains unclear when the 737 Max will return to service and how consumers will respond once the planes are back in the air.\n\nSee more: Boeing faces a 46% drop in quarterly profit\n\nTesla TSLA, +0.82% looks on track to deliver its first quarterly revenue decline in more than a decade, prompting questions about what\u2019s next for the electric-car maker. Analysts project an 11% drop in third-quarter revenue, to $6.43 billion, and RBC wonders if the pressure for growth will prompt the company to accelerate the launch of its Model Y mid-size SUV. Production of that vehicle was expected to begin late next year.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Tesla already posted disappointing delivery numbers for the third quarter, but the company\u2019s profit trajectory remains an unknown heading into the Wednesday afternoon report. RBC is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the company will show positive free-cash flow once again.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s MSFT, -1.49% report is likely to be the tamest of the big three, with analysts upbeat as always about momentum in the company\u2019s Azure cloud-computing business. Look for commentary on the trajectory of the Windows 10 migration cycle with the end of Windows 7 support coming up in January. A pattern of strong PC sales so far this year indicates that the refresh cycle might be more spread out than initially expected, perhaps due to more long-term contracts.\n\nThe company\u2019s report is due out after the bell.\n\n\u2022 Former corporate siblings eBay Inc. EBAY, -0.82% and PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, -4.02% are both on the afternoon docket as well, and the reports could bring more excitement than usual given an activist battle at eBay and some key unknowns for PayPal. EBay\u2019s conference call will feature the company\u2019s new interim chief executive, Scott Schenkel, who took over last month after the company\u2019s former head, Devin Wenig, resigned due to a disagreement with the board. The company has also been moving along with a strategic review that could lead to the sales of its StubHub and Classifieds businesses. PayPal is expected to feel an impact next year from eBay\u2019s decision to manage its own payments process and relegate the digital payments pioneer to a lesser role on its site. Analysts will be looking for an initial 2020 outlook, which may hold clues about how the company expects that transition to play out.\n\n\u2022 Joining Tesla on Wednesday\u2019s automotive earnings slate is Ford Motor Co. F, +0.44% , which faces low expectations from investors, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. They say that third-quarter numbers \u201cmay not pack a big punch\u201d but that big structural changes at the company could start to pay off positively. The company is \u201crestructuring the operations to allocate capital towards businesses where the company can win and away from areas where it cannot,\u201d in their view, but it remains to be seen whether Ford can execute effectively on that plan. The Wednesday morning earnings report could provide some early indications.\n\n\u2022 Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +1.10% shares have fallen following the company\u2019s past six earnings reports and the equipment giant will be looking to break that streak Wednesday morning amid weak sentiment for its sector. William Blair analysts recently cited a \u201cplummeting\u201d market for construction equipment that\u2019s leading to rising inventory as production cuts haven\u2019t kept up with the new pace of sales. \u201cFurther production cuts are probably warranted,\u201d they wrote.\n\nCaterpillar earnings: Expect weakness on China tensions and global economic slowdown", "description": "Boeing Co., Tesla Inc., and Microsoft Corp. headline an action-packed slate of Wednesday earnings.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HF541_boeing_ZG_20190312154044.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
