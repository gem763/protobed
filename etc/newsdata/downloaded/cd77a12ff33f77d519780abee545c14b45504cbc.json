U.S. homebuilding also fell from a more than a 12-year high in September.\n\nData on Wednesday showed that U.S. retail sales fell for the first time in seven months in September, adding to concerns that the U.S. economy is slowing.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates when it meets on October 29-30, though Fed policymakers are divided on whether further cuts are needed for the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n)", "description": "U.S. Treasury yields rose to their highest in almost a month on Thursday after Britain clinched a last-minute Brexit deal with the European Union, easing concerns about a disorderly exit.
