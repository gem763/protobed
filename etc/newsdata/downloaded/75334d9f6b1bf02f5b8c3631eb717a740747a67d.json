Judges do not take sides as the anonymous Downing Street source suggests. In accordance with their judicial oath the judges today applied the law \"without fear or favour\" \u2013 and it would be utterly wrong for anyone to suggest they would ever do otherwise.\n\nIt is a matter of deep concern to have to restate these principles when lawyers associated with the Supreme Court decision over parliament\u2019s role in Brexit are not only receiving death threats but having the location of their family homes publicised on social media by a journalist, simply for doing their job in representing their clients.

Such threats should not be tolerated. Barristers practising in the legal system are independent and objective advocates. They are trained to advise their clients on the strengths and weaknesses of their case and to advocate their cause objectively. They are duty-bound to act in the interests of their clients, irrespective of their own beliefs, and not to mislead the court.\n\nThey do not put forward their personal opinions, but act on their client\u2019s instructions. Judges reach objective decisions based upon the evidence placed before them and their interpretation of the law. They act independently of politics, a principle which cannot be stressed too highly in these febrile times.\n\nIn other countries and fragile states we have seen the consequences which follow when the rule of law has been disregarded if not openly abandoned. Lawyers, judges and journalists are persecuted and imprisoned for defending their clients and standing up for the rights of the most vulnerable in society \u2013 that is, fulfilling their professional duties. The Bar Council has not hesitated to speak out in defence of our fellow legal professionals when these situations arise, and we shall continue to do so. We shall call on political leaders to give the rule of law the value and weight it deserves.\n\nWe would never for a moment imagine that this principle, based upon Magna Carta settled over 800 years ago, for which our legal system has become world-renowned, could be casually laid aside to suit the convenience of politicians closer to home. The separation of the powers of the Executive (government), Legislature (parliament) and Judiciary are the foundations of our democratic way of life. We allow this separation of powers to be eroded at our peril, which is why lawyers should not hesitate to speak truth to power. Lawyers should not be vilified for doing so or threatened with reprisals for acting in accordance with their professional duty.\n\nThe recently reported comments attributed to a \u201cNo 10 source\u201d display a complete failure to understand how our legal system operates and threaten to undermine the role of our independent judiciary and thus the rule of law. They should be repudiated immediately lest they send a signal to the rest of the world, and to the people of the United Kingdom, that the government no longer places any value on the rule of law. There is too much at stake for the future of our country to allow this to happen.\n\nRichard Atkins QC is the chair of the Bar Council of England and Wales", "description": "We have reached a low point in our history when a faceless \u201cNo10 source\u201d refers to \"remainiac lawyers\" and issues threats to the judiciary about its constitutional role, suggesting that judges take sides.
