In the end, I braved the torrential rain to go to the grand old station.\n\nImage copyright Art in All of Us Image caption Ethiopia's rail network was neglected for decades\n\nOnce there, however, trying to find the ticket office also proved difficult. The guards looked bemused by my inquiry.\n\nWhen I did find it on the first floor, the woman behind the wooden desk seemed equally bemused by my request for a return ticket.\n\nShe told me to wait for her manager. He in turn said they did not sell the train tickets - but if I wanted bus tickets, I could buy those.\n\nIf it was the train I really wanted, he said I should go to the new Chinese-built station outside Addis Ababa and buy my ticket there.\n\nIsmail Einashe The building, which looked like it had been parachuted directly from China to Ethiopia, was completely deserted.\n\nThe manager assured me the SGR was working, but advised I arrive early - by 06:30.\n\nI felt reassured, until the next problem - finding the location of this new station.\n\nIt is not as easy as you may imagine, first of all the station is not yet on Google Maps and locals seemed clueless.\n\nForced to fly\n\nAt last a hotel receptionist found me a taxi driver in the know, who said it was a 90-minute drive away - and would cost $18, almost as expensive as the train ticket.\n\nSo we set off on a cold, wet, dark Tuesday at 05:00.\n\nWe drove past the changing landscape of Bole district in Addis Ababa, where I used to live - but it's now very different: full of huge, newly built hotels and malls.\n\nThe road eventually ran out and we drove for several kilometres along a dirt track before the large Furi-Labu railway station appeared from nowhere.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The new station is supposed to be a source of pride for Ethiopians\n\nThe building, which looked like it had been parachuted directly from China to Ethiopia, was completely deserted - only a soldier stood guard, with a few Chinese workers roaming around.\n\nIt felt eerie, as if abandoned. I walked up the huge concrete steps and spoke to the soldier who told me the station had been closed for at least \"two weeks\" as there were technical issues with track near Dire Dawa.\n\nThere would be no trains that morning.\n\nI returned to the hotel - again covered in mud after torrential rain - left with no choice but to fly.\n\nBut the internet was down - not an unusual situation in Ethiopia these days - so I had to book my flight by phone.\n\nAnd by the time I should have been arriving at Dire Dawa's new station at 15.50 that day, I was instead in the departure lounge at Addis Ababa airport waiting for my gate to be announced.\n\nMore Letters from Africa\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica", "description": "Ethiopia is hugely proud of its new Chinese-built railway - but it is surprisingly difficult to buy a ticket.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DCD4/production/_108623565_hi035499568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
