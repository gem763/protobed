Users who joined after that date were not affected, DoorDash said. Compromised data included profile information, including names, delivery addresses, and order history, and, for some consumers, the last four digits of credit cards. Full credit card information was not accessed, and the information accessed is not enough to ring up fraudulent charges, DoorDash said. For some delivery people and merchants, the last four digits of their bank account was accessed, but not full bank information, DoorDash said. About 100,000 delivery people had their driver's license numbers compromised, the company said. DoorDash will be reaching out directly to those affected, it said.", "description": "Food delivery app DoorDash Inc. said late Thursday that \"an unauthorized third party\" accessed some of its user data on May 4, affecting about 4.9...", "authors": ["Claudia Assis"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
