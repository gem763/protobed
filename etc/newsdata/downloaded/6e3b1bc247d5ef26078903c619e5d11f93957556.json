But it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019ll all qualify again in November.\n\n[What the Democratic candidates have to do to win Tuesday\u2019s debate]\n\nThanks to another tightening of the rules by the Democratic National Committee, just eight candidates appear to have qualified for the November debate so far.\n\nWho has qualified for each debate\n\nJune\n\ndebate July Aug. Oct. Nov.\n\nso far Dropped out Dropped out Dropped out Dropped out Dropped out\n\nUnder the new rules, candidates must register at least 3 percent in four polls approved by the party since Sept. 13, or at least 5 percent in two early state polls. Candidates must also earn donations from at least 165,000 unique donors, with at least 600 coming from 20 individual states.\n\nThese requirements must be met by the end of Nov. 13. The DNC will officially release the list of qualified candidates around that date, a week in advance of the debate.\n\nAs with previous debates, candidates are having a tougher time meeting the polling threshold than the donor requirements. Each candidate who has met the polling threshold also has enough donors, according to their campaigns. Four candidates have met the donor threshold but not the polling threshold: former housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke (Tex.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii).\n\nTwo of those candidates, O\u2019Rourke and Klobuchar, have earned at least 3 percent in one approved poll. But both of those polls were taken in September. Neither candidate has hit 3 percent in the last 13 qualifying polls.\n\n3% in four national or early state polls or 5% in two early state polls 4% Needs 3 more or Needs 2 more 3% Needs 3 more or Needs 2 more\n\nCandidates without strong national polling numbers may appear to have a better shot at reaching 5 percent in two Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada polls \u2014 what the DNC considers the \u201cearly states.\u201d But that threshold has proved difficult to reach too. Even billionaire activist Tom Steyer, who qualified for the October debate by blanketing early states with ads, has yet to hit 5 percent in any qualifying early-state poll.\n\nPollsters don\u2019t typically announce their polls in advance, so it\u2019s not clear how many more chances the candidates will have to qualify. In the past few months, a qualifying poll has been released roughly every two days, and 16 qualifying polls have been released during this debate\u2019s qualification window so far.\n\nAbout this report\n\nThis analysis is based on rules set by the DNC. Individual donor numbers are reported by the campaigns. Polling totals are based on numbers compiled by Politico.\n\nRead more\n\nWe\u2019re asking 2020 Democrats where they stand on key issues\n\nAnalysis | The top 15 Democratic presidential candidates of 2020, ranked and tiered\n\nAnalysis | Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Facebook ad proves the social media giant still has a politics problem", "description": "The DNC has raised the bar again, likely further narrowing the field.", "authors": ["Kevin Schaul", "Senior Graphics Editor Covering Politics", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PuyLjxfvEhziK64kY16coa_NIb0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MC5EKJIIHFFEZMCKGYL2FTRSJU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
