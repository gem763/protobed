Gregariousness, cocktail party charm, the ability to hold one\u2019s drink \u2014 all of that mattered, of course. But above all, what le Carr\u00e9 wanted was \u201ca sense of larceny,\u201d as he explains during an interview at his north London home. \u201cSomebody who enjoys the adventure and is not scrupulous about small stuff.\u201d\n\nIn his new novel, \u201cAgent Running In the Field\u201d \u2014 set in modern-day Britain \u2014 the main character, Nat, is called out by his daughter about his lack of ethics. \u201cFor the sake of a country that you have serious reservations about, even very serious, you persuade other nationals to betray their own countr ies,\u201d she tells him. Nat counters with an argument which le Carr\u00e9 admits is similar to his own: \u201cI don\u2019t think I persuaded anybody to do anything they didn\u2019t want to do,\u201d le Carr\u00e9 says. \u201cI think I enabled them to do it and provided the protection.\u201d\n\nThis morally murky world of spying is where le Carr\u00e9 continues to make his literary mark. \u201cAgent Running in the Field,\u201d which Viking will publish on Oct. 22 , is his 25th novel. It comes only two years after his last, \u201cA Legacy of Spies,\u201d and shows that, approaching his 88th birthday, the author isn\u2019t exactly slowing down.\n\nImage John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s \u201cAgent Running in the Field\u201d comes out Oct. 22. Credit Sonny Figueroa/The New York Times\n\n\u201cI have no real leisure activity,\u201d le Carr\u00e9 says. \u201cI am dismayed when I\u2019m not writing, completely content when I am. I also find, thus far, that I\u2019m unaware of any relaxation of my talent. I also am stimulated and appalled by the path my country has taken.\u201d", "description": "John le Carr\u00e9 takes aim at Brexit and Boris Johnson in his new novel, \u201cAgent Running in the Field.\u201d", "authors": ["Tobias Grey"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/12/books/12Lecarre1/12Lecarre1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
