I\u2019m pretty new in the sport. I retired wrestling 18 months ago, moved into MMA. I\u2019ll take my time, develop and let\u2019s see what the future will bring me.\u201d\n\nHe got high billing for his UFC debut, a co-main event spot in his home country of Denmark. But Madsen is no stranger to the big stage, and lived up to the expectations, delivering in front of his home crowd.\n\n\u201cWell obviously competing on the world\u2019s biggest MMA stage, UFC, is a pretty big deal right?\u201d Madsen said. \u201cThis was my debut, I thought I was going to be fighting on the prelims. I got bumped up being a co-main event in front of 13,000 Danish fans. It was a lot of pressure, it was an exciting challenge and well I got to put it all the way up there, winning an Olympic medal and performing in front of a home crowd, the feeling is pretty much the same. It was very exciting.\u201d\n\nMadsen understands in order to take his career and training to the next level, he\u2019d likely have to make the move to the United States. He already got American life, when he spent time training in Las Vegas at Xtreme Couture and the UFC Performance Institute, but says he\u2019s not sure which gym he\u2019ll end up calling home.\n\n\u201cI will be doing my camps here in the States so whenever I have a fight, I\u2019ll be coming here,\u201d Madsen said. \u201cWherever I get the best training, I mean the States has a bunch of great wrestlers, especially in MMA, top ranked so this is the place to develop my MMA wrestling.\u201d\n\nFor more from Madsen, click on the video linked above.", "description": "Greco-Roman wrestling Olympian Mark Madsen, believes he has the potential to beat anyone in the lightweight division.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan", "Simon Head", "Mike Bohn", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/mark-madsen-dominance-media-day.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
