For that game to unravel the way it did has helped us turn up here full of confidence,\u201d said England skipper Joe Root.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very much alive in this series. The fact we turned it around shows the character of the group. There was no hangover going into the second innings and we massively believe we should be winning this series,\u201d he added.\n\nEngland have made a switch to their seam bowling attack, bringing in Craig Overton for Chris Woakes while Root will shuffle his upper-order batsmen with Jason Roy dropping down to four and Joe Denly moving up to open with Rory Burns.\n\nRoy, a successful part of England\u2019s World Cup-winning one-day team admitted he has struggled at the top of the order.\n\n\u201cI knew that opening the batting in test cricket was going to be completely different to one-day cricket, but I have found it really difficult,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMoving down the order to number four for this test, mentally it\u2019s a lot more comforting. You get a bit more time to ease into an innings,\u201d he said.\n\nSIGNIFICANT BOOST\n\nWhile defeat was hard to take for Australia, the return of Smith is a significant boost.\n\nThe 30-year-old has made a powerful personal comeback in this series, after serving a one-year ban from the game for his role in a ball-tampering scandal.\n\nThe Australian number four has made an emphatic return from his enforced absence to the longest format, with twin hundreds in the first Ashes test in Birmingham.\n\nHe followed that up with a 92 at Lord\u2019s before being felled by a short ball from England fast bowler Jofra Archer. He then missed the Headingley test due to concussion.\n\nSmith and Archer will resume their duel on what is expected to be a fast and bouncy surface at Old Trafford.\n\nCricket - Australia Nets - Emirates Old Trafford, Manchester, Britain - September 3, 2019 Australia's Steve Smith during nets Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff\n\n\u201cI think everyone in the world is looking forward to watching Steve Smith bat. We always do,\u201d said Aussie skipper Tim Paine, who is confident the batsman will pick up where he left off.\n\n\u201cSteve has missed one test Match, he hasn\u2019t been out for 12 months. He came back from a 12-month layoff pretty well so I expect he will handle six days without batting pretty well.\u201d\n\nThe out-of-form Usman Khawaja makes way for Smith while Australia will have to decide between Peter Siddle and Mitchell Starc in their bowling attack.", "description": "The world's number one batsman Steve Smith returns to the fray as England and Australia resume battle on Wednesday in an Ashes series that is perfectly poised.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425868370&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821UI"}
