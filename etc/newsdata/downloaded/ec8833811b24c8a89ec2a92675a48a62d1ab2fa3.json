Hell no. Their team was getting steamrolled 42-10 at halftime and they live in beautiful South Florida, where beaches, nightclubs and premium seafood were only a 30-minute drive away. (Even safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, a first-round draft pick in 2018, appears to want out as ESPN reported that he was granted permission to seek a trade.)\n\nIt was there, in that moment, that I fully realized how miserable this season is going to be for Dolphins fans. I knew this team was going to stink, but did I think they would be historically bad, especially in Week 1, when hope reigns supreme in all NFL cities? No.\n\nIt's going to be a rough season for Dolphins fans this year. (Getty Images)\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter the way the Dolphins got trounced, suffering their worst loss in franchise history, it\u2019s clear that things in South Florida are going to get a whole lot worse before they get better. Offensively, Ryan Fitzpatrick isn\u2019t the long-term answer at quarterback, and good luck getting a read on second-year pro Josh Rosen\u2019s upside behind an offensive line in flux after general manager Chris Grier (smartly) traded away Laremy Tunsil for a bevy of premium picks.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Dolphins might be even worse defensively, where they surrendered an embarrassing 265 yards on 46 carries Sunday, numbers that would even make the 2008 Detroit Lions \u2014 who have the worst rush defense of the past 12 years by surrendering a bloated 172 yards per game \u2014 blush.\n\nThat historic Lions team was the first in NFL history to go 0-16, and with the Dolphins being the early leader in the clubhouse as the franchise with the best odds of repeating that feat in 2019, it\u2019s hard not to wonder if this team\u2019s general suckitude is all by design, similar to the Sashi Brown-led Browns of six years ago and the \u201cTrust the Process\u201d Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA.\n\nThe Dolphins deny tanking, of course, but by dealing Tunsil, one of the league\u2019s best young left tackles, a few weekends ago and shipping out several other solid veterans over the past month, it looks like the recently promoted Grier and new head coach Brian Flores are well on their way to earning the top pick in the 2020 draft.\n\nIn a vacuum, that\u2019s OK. Because now more than ever, you can justify the end \u2014 landing a star quarterback through the draft \u2014 is worth the means. The NFL is a passing league, which means the importance of having a premium QB1, someone who can raise the level of his teammates, has grown, too, and this year\u2019s draft figures to feature at least two franchise quarterbacks in Alabama lefty Tua Tagovailoa and Oregon\u2019s Justin Herbert.\n\nTagovailoa looks like a Steve Young clone while Herbert\u2019s combination of size, arm strength and athleticism routinely make NFL scouts gawk like the first time Jack Napier saw Batman. Both players would be worth a tank job, and Miami should have their pick of either in April.\n\nSome will make the argument that tanking raises the hazard level for players but I disagree. These are professionals being paid to play for a living, and football is far less violent than it was even 10 years ago since the game is officiated differently. While some Miami veterans might start protecting themselves during a lost season by making Deion Sanders-like on-field business decisions, other less-established players will keep playing hard, sensing an opportunity to get quality tape and a payday down the road.\n\nYet, there\u2019s one problem for Grier and Flores, and it\u2019s a big one: It\u2019s possible that they may have done too good of a job stripping this roster down. It\u2019s one thing to be bad, but it\u2019s another to be embarrassing. Sunday\u2019s result was unacceptable, and if the Dolphins don\u2019t at least show improvement this year, it opens the door for team owner Stephen Ross to make changes.\n\nThere\u2019s a history of tanking teams doing just that. Both the general manager (Sashi Brown) and head coach (Hue Jackson) of the Browns were broomed out before they could reach the end of the rainbow, while the same can be said of the GM of the 76ers (Sam Hinkie).\n\nMeanwhile, the 76ers\u2019 coach during the \u201cThe Process\u201d (Brett Brown) is still hanging on following a successful rebuild, but there\u2019s increasing pressure on him to deliver after their conference semifinals loss in May.\n\nAdd in the fact there\u2019s not a professional sports league in America where coaches and executives generally have a shorter rope than the NFL, and yeah, for Grier and Flores\u2019 sake, I hope:\n\na) They start playing a little better.\n\n\n\nb) Ross is ready for the impending pain that will soon come as the losses pile up, the late-night TV hosts start making jokes and season-ticket renewals stagnate.\n\nThe good news for Dolphins fans is that either way, there is hope at the end of the rainbow, provided Miami lands a franchise quarterback in April.\n\nIn the meantime, all involved will simply have to ready themselves for the realization that the incriminating sea of empty aqua green seats we saw Sunday will only grow between now and then.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "It\u2019s possible that they may have done too good of a job stripping this roster down.
