Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it's important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful.\n\nA high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Muehlhan. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying Muehlhan for its dividend - read on to learn more.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nXTRA:M4N Historical Dividend Yield, October 10th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Muehlhan paid out 40% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Unfortunately, while Muehlhan pays a dividend, it also reported negative free cash flow last year. While there may be a good reason for this, it's not ideal from a dividend perspective.\n\nWe update our data on Muehlhan every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Muehlhan's dividend payments. Its dividend payments have fallen by 20% or more on at least one occasion over the past ten years. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was \u20ac0.06 in 2009, compared to \u20ac0.10 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.2% a year over that time. The dividends haven't grown at precisely 5.2% every year, but this is a useful way to average out the historical rate of growth.\n\nDividends have grown at a reasonable rate, but with at least one substantial cut in the payments, we're not certain this dividend stock would be ideal for someone intending to live on the income.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? It's good to see Muehlhan has been growing its earnings per share at 21% a year over the past five years. With high earnings per share growth in recent times and a modest payout ratio, we think this is an attractive combination if earnings can be reinvested to generate further growth.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could Muehlhan AG (ETR:M4N) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul?
