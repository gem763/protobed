Any investor will tell you that, we are ready to invest a dollar if we think that there will be a return on that dollar in the future; if we think there is too much uncertainty, then we'd better invest that dollar somewhere else, in another industry or another country.\"\n\nAddressing the Summit earlier, Mr Honorat expressed wariness over increasing regulatory and market interventions. He said Australia seems to be \"regaining an appetite for large-scale government-funded projects which are not driven by market signals\" that would be \"locked into customers\u2019 bills for decades\".\n\nAdding a view from investors was Emma Herd, chief executive of Investor Group on Climate Change, who said the uncertainty around policy in the absence of a co-ordinated national plan for energy and climate is adding to risks that are difficult to price.\n\n\"In some cases, the decision is you can\u2019t accurately price risk, so won\u2019t deploy capital because you can\u2019t get confident on risk/reward decisions until some of those moving parts are pinned down,\" said Ms Herd, whose group represents institutional investors with $2 trillion of assets under management.\n\nShe called for a national plan \"which is not a series of ad hoc interventions to deal with portions of the issue, but rather an integrated understanding of both supply and demand factors, technology change, the genuine industry acknowledgement of decarbonisation drivers, and understanding how different providers will come in and out of the market\".\n\nEnergyAustralia chief executive Catherine Tanna said \"stability\" was the key to get investment flowing, underscoring the difficulty of getting capital-intensive projects over the line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"So what I would encourage here is, drop the 'big stick' rhetoric, and focus on enabling the environment that will enable and encourage investment, but particularly investment by private companies,\" said Ms Tanna, who also sits on the Reserve Bank of Australia board.\n\n\"Because something like $400 billion needs to be spent on the future of the energy system and that's just such an astonishingly large amount of money and it means its going to take lots of people to invest to make that happen.\n\n\"We want to make sure that investments happen so that the capacity, the services are there when they are needed, not that there's a panic to solve something too late.\"\n\nBut Mr Sims rubbished most of the industry's arguments on the reasons for the investment \"strike\", and for high electricity and gas prices.\n\n\"Much of the commentary suggests that various government policies are to blame but this is simplistic, and sometimes a deliberate diversion,\" he said.\n\n\"Industry must shoulder an important part of the blame for where we are now.\"\n\n'Confusing' discounts slammed\n\nHe emphasised that the problem of affordability went far beyond wholesale power to retailing, unnecessary rooftop solar subsidies and earlier excessive investment in networks in Queensland, NSW and Tasmania that have inflated consumer power bills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Sims said he firmly believed electricity retailers had intentionally pursued their strategy of confusing discounts for households and small businesses in the knowledge that the practice was unsustainable.\n\nHe said they deliberately hiked standing offers knowing those customers were unlikely to switch supplier, to be able to offer higher and higher discounts off a higher base.\n\n\"You had people paying hundreds of dollars more than they should be for what is an essential service,\" he said.\n\n\"The energy retailers should have fixed that. I think the industry brought on the default market offer on itself.\"\n\nMr Sims also reiterated calls for certain state governments to write down the value of their networks and for rooftop solar subsidies to be abandoned, both of which would immediately put downward pressure on prices.\n\nBut the ACCC chief also signalled a looming issue over the growing market power of federal government-owned Snowy Hydro, which looks set to increase when the Snowy 2.0 storage project comes online.\n\nCredit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic also lashed complaints from big energy users about high prices, declaring \"gas intensive manufacturers are not just in the manufacturing business anymore \u2013 they're in the government lobbying business\".\n\nHe said their push for the government to trigger the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism and divert gas into the domestic market represented a \"slippery slope towards price controls\".", "description": "Suggestions from Rod Sims that electricity suppliers are delaying investments to keep power prices high have been rejected by companies and investors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6517%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_97%2C$y_76/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1ff8ca07c12ab97c84f7c900f6b88e1bfb9d3c98", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
