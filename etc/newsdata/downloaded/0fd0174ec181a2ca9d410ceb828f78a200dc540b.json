Sondland, the blunt-spoken hotelier who is President Donald Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, was boasting on Ukrainian television that Trump had honored him with a \u201cspecial assignment\u201d \u2014 \u201coverseeing\u201d relations between the two countries \u201cat the highest levels.\u201d\n\nSondland had arrived in Kyiv on July 25, the day of the now-infamous telephone call between Trump and the new president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He had spoken to Trump minutes before the call, he said, and met with Zelenskiy for an hour the next morning, before his television interview.\n\nAt the time, his television remarks might have been the kind of diplomatic bluster one would expect of Sondland, a big, loquacious man who has been a prominent Republican donor and fundraiser for years and loves to remind people of the good relationship he has developed with Trump.\n\nBut in the glare of the impeachment inquiry swirling in Washington, Sondland\u2019s mission is now being scrutinized in an entirely different light, to assess whether it was to give a lift to U.S. relations with Ukraine or actually to serve as Trump\u2019s personal fixer.\n\n\u201cWe can make sure that all the reforms and all of the initiatives that we are undertaking with Ukraine stay on track and happen quickly,\u201d Sondland said in the television interview.\n\nWhat Sondland did not say, and what has become clear in the messages released Thursday by House Democrats, is that one of the main initiatives was getting Zelenskiy to agree publicly to a statement committing Ukraine to pursue investigations sought by Trump into his political rivals, especially former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, and into supposed meddling from Ukraine in the 2016 election.\n\nIn return, Zelenskiy would get the White House meeting he craved and, implicitly, Washington would release military aid held up on Trump\u2019s request.\n\nAsked in the interview about progress in Ukraine-U.S. relations, including questions like membership of NATO and energy security, Sondland urged patience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of saying no,\u201d Sondland said of the Zelenskiy government. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of saying when. There are certain things that they have to do. There are preconditions to anything.\u201d\n\nSondland also spoke to Ukraine\u2019s state-run news agency after the call and said: \u201cThe conversation was very successful. They found a common language immediately.\u201d He said the two leaders discussed Ukraine\u2019s war, energy security and \u201cthe rule of law.\u201d\n\nSondland, 62, arrived in Brussels as ambassador to the European Union in June of last year, having raised a lot of money for Trump after building a lucrative hotel chain in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nHe sees his job as pressing Trump\u2019s agenda, which is tightly focused on trade and the impediments that led to a $151 billion trade deficit in goods with the European Union, a figure Sondland often cites.\n\nSondland has said that his grandparents were from Ukraine. His parents were both refugees from the Nazis, and he was the first in his family to be born in the United States.\n\nIn September 2018, Sondland posted a video to introduce himself and his family to Europeans, featuring shots of him making coffee, relaxing at home, showing off his collection of art, climbing into a jet that he likes to pilot and walking his dogs on the beach with his wife, Katherine Durant, a businesswoman, and introducing his son Max and daughter Lucy.\n\nSondland backed out of hosting a fundraiser for Trump in 2016, citing Trump\u2019s disparaging comments toward immigrants and the family of a slain Muslim American soldier. But in the end Sondland donated $1 million through his companies to the inaugural committee for Trump.\n\nThat relationship seems to have led to his apparent responsibility in Ukraine after the previous ambassador, Marie L. Yovanovitch, a career diplomat, displeased the White House and was removed several months before the end of her term.\n\nSondland\u2019s \u201cspecial assignment\u201d from Trump was never formally announced, but it was instrumental in the negotiations with Zelenskiy\u2019s team and Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, who was pressing for these essentially political investigations.\n\nOfficials in Sondland\u2019s embassy say that the Ukrainian effort was not a part of their own work with the European Union and that they were not aware of the extent of Sondland\u2019s activities in Ukraine.", "description": "BRUSSELS -- Gordon D.
