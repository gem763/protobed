As pointed out by David Smith, author of Less Than Human, among many other things, dehumanisation is a way of subverting inhibitions that prevent us from violently harming people \u2013 as we see them as less than human.\n\nThis is an extremely difficult time for migrants and other marginalised people, not just in South Africa but all around the world.\n\nThe virulent xenophobia of US President Donald Trump is well known. In India, threats of a citizenship list have sparked fear. In Hungary, draconian laws targeting migrants have been put in place.\n\nElites across regions are increasingly attempting to cast migration as a danger to everyone \u2013 deflecting from the real crises which are poverty, rising inequality, an unprecedented environmental crisis and a general sense of instability.\n\nThere are no easy solutions to this problem, both the current violence and the ways in which it is enabled.\n\nAccording to reports, there were warnings of the violent outbreaks. The agencies involved should be held accountable for their failure to act on these warnings.\n\nThis also applies to politicians and government officials who spew hateful views, and to those of us who perpetuate them in our daily interactions.\n\nInterventions that are rooted in evidence and understanding of the key drivers of violence are critical.\n\nMost importantly though, we all must engage in a long-overdue reckoning with the country\u2019s extensive history and present practice of using exclusion as well as law and order as ammunition when mobilising for violence.\n\nThis needs to be urgently addressed, otherwise we will continue to be needlessly divided \u2013 while natural resources and poor black people, irrespective of our nationalities, continue to be exploited by elites.\n\nKoketso Moeti has a long background in civic activism and has worked at the intersection of governance, communication and citizen action.
