Whenever I think of Sulli I will always remember how beautiful her smile is.\u2019\n\nWho was K-pop star Sulli?\n\nSulli, whose real name was Choi Jin-ri, was scouted by South Korea\u2019s largest entertainment company, S.M. Entertainment Co. when she was 16 years old and initially forged a career as a young actress.\n\nSulli has been in the public eye since she was a teenager (Picture: Multi-Bits/Multi-Bits via Getty Images)\n\nHer first foray into acting professionally came in 2005 when she played Princess Seonhwa of Silla in the SBS drama Ballad of Seodong and she was then recruited by S.M. to join their new five-member dance-focused pop group, f(x).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe band was compromised of four other up and coming stars alongside Sulli named Victoria, Amber, Luna and Krystal.\n\nTheir debut single as called LA chA TA was released on September 1 2009 and went on to release their first full-length studio album Pinocchio in April 2011.\n\nIn 2013, f(x) became the first K-Pop band ever to perform at SXSW in Austin, Texas and a year later they picked up a \u2018Group Artist\u2019 award at the 20th Korean Entertainment Arts Awards.\n\nThe band continued to enjoy varying degrees of success but Sulli had to take a brief hiatus from the band in 2014 due to mental and physical exhaustion.\n\nThen, in August 2015, Sulli announced she would be leaving the band for good.\n\nSulli left f(x) for good in 2015 (Picture: Han Myung-Gu/WireImage)\n\nOpening up about her reasons for quitting f(x) during the first episode of her reality show, Jinri Store, in 2018 Sulli confessed: \u2018I was under so much pressure. I often felt scared. We [f(x)] felt so much pressure. I did what someone told me to do without knowing the reason.\n\n\u2018At some point, I started to realise and started to wonder why I should do this and for what I\u2019m doing this\u2026 I said I\u2019m exhausted, but no one listened to me,\u2019 the then 24-year-old sadly admitted, before adding, \u2018I felt like I was alone.\u2019\n\nSulli has died aged 25 (Picture: Han Myung-Gu/WireImage)\n\nAfter her departure from f(x), Sulli pursued her acting career, appearing in a movie called Real, with actor Kim Soo Hyun and and TV dramas To The Beautiful You and Hotel Del Luna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSulli won the Best New Star award at the SBS Drama Awards in 2012 for her role as Goo Jae-hee in To The Beautiful You.\n\nSulli received critical acclaim for her role in To The Beautiful You (Picture: The Chosunilbo JNS/Multi-Bits via Getty Images)\n\nIt was announced earlier this year that Sulli would return to her singing career, but this time as a solo artist and she released her debut single, Goblin, in June.\n\nAt the beginning of her music video for the single, a description is both Korean and English reads: \u2018This is a story about a person with a dissociative disorder. She is with herself and with three other personalities.\u2019\n\nThe video then begins with Sulli speaking to the camera, although it is unclear if she is in character or not. She says: \u2018They suddenly appeared one day. Maybe it\u2019s just a memory from some characters. Is it because of stress? Or\u2026I don\u2019t know. Sometimes I wonder if \u2018They\u2019 are really \u2018me\u2019. So who am I really? Did I do something wrong? I just want to end it\u2026That\u2019s what I think sometimes.\u2019\n\nSulli\u2019s cause of death has yet to be confirmed.\n\nMORE: K-pop star Sulli found dead aged 25\n\nMORE: Amber Liu cancels upcoming activities after death of former f(x) bandmate Sulli", "description": "K-Pop star Sulli, who found fame when she joined girl band f(x) in 2009, has reportedly died aged 25 in Sujeong-gu, Seongnam, South Korea.", "authors": ["Rachael Martin"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1051834704_1571049836.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
