(AP) - Following a 16-10 win at Buffalo in Week 4, questions began to crop up about the New England Patriots\u2019 offense that struggled to get the ball in the end zone in their first serious test of the season.\n\nThe Patriots had the perfect opponent in Week 5 to have a bounce-back game.\n\nNew England\u2019s offense dominated in a 33-7 thumping of the Washington Redskins on Sunday , getting contributions from both the passing and rushing games.\n\nTom Brady threw for a season-high 348 yards and three touchdowns. Receiver Julian Edelman caught eight passes for 110 yards and a score. And after some criticism from the coaching staff in recent weeks, second-year running back Sony Michel rushed for a season-high 91 yards and a TD.\n\nIt complemented a defense that continues to force turnovers and make it difficult for opponents to get in the end zone.\n\nReceiver Josh Gordon, who added five catches for 59 yards in Sunday\u2019s win, said getting a season-best 130 yards out of the rushing game was big for everyone\u2019s confidence.\n\n\u201cThe game is easier when you\u2019re running the ball,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cThe routes become easier, not nearly as tired and morale is high. We\u2019re just happy the offensive line was pushing downfield and the running backs were running hard. It\u2019s good ol\u2019 fashion football and when you\u2019re playing the game, you love to see it.\u201d\n\nIt all added up to a 5-0 start for the fifth time in team history and the fourth time under Bill Belichick (2004, 2007, 2015, 2019).\n\nThe caveat is that four of New England\u2019s victories have come against teams that are a combined 1-17 (Steelers, Dolphins, Jets, Redskins). Still, two of the three previous times the Patriots won their first five games during the Belichick era they went on to the Super Bowl.\n\nNew England won its third Lombardi Trophy during the 2004 season. And following a 16-0 regular season in 2007, it took David Tyree\u2019s helmet catch in the waning moments of the Super Bowl that season to deny the Patriots another championship.\n\nThe Patriots have four games before their bye week and only one of those opponents - 3-2 Baltimore - is currently above .500. It gives New England a very realistic chance of moving to 9-0 before diving in a much tougher second half of the season that includes matchups against the Eagles (3-2), Cowboys (3-2), Texans (3-2) and Chiefs (4-1).\n\nLinebacker Dont\u2019a Hightower, who led the team with eight tackles and 1\u00bd sacks on Sunday, said New England\u2019s defense is expecting to shut down opposing offenses.\n\nSo far it has, allowing an NFL-low 6.8 points per game. The Patriots have also yet to give up a passing touchdown.\n\n\u201cWhenever we go out, we have the attitude that there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t force them to go three-and-out, there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t get a pick on the first play, there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t knock the ball out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhenever you have 11 guys on the field that are conscious of the ball or the quarterback and running back good things happen.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe Patriots continue to pile up sacks this season. The defense had six sacks against Washington, its fourth straight game with at least five sacks. It marks the first time in team history that New England has had at least five sacks in four straight games. The Patriots have a league-high 24 on the season.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe offensive line did a much better job keying the run, but Brady was sacked four times in the first half. He hadn\u2019t been sacked that many times in a regular-season game since Week 3 of the 2017 season.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nTight end Ryan Izzo had only two catches for 39 yards, but one was for a 10-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. It was the first TD catch for a Patriots tight end this season.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nKicker Mike Nugent didn\u2019t make the best first impression in his debut in place of Stephen Gostkowski, who was placed on injured reserve last week. Nugent missed his first extra point attempt following New England\u2019s first touchdown. He also needed an assist from the upright to make another one. For the game he connected on both of his field-goal attempts and was 3 of 4 extra points.\n\nGostkowski missed four extra points in four games before going on IR. With Nugent\u2019s miss that\u2019s five misses in five games. New England signed Younghoe Koo to the practice squad as well last week, so it\u2019s possible he could get a closer look from coaches this week.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\nEight. That\u2019s the number of third down conversions New England\u2019s defense has allowed this season. Washington was held to 1 of 11 on third down, Buffalo to 2 of 13, the Jets had zero third-down conversions, Miami two and Pittsburgh three.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nHost the New York Giants (2-3) on Thursday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Following a 16-10 win at Buffalo in Week 4, questions began to crop up about the New England Patriots' offense that struggled to get the ball in the end zone in their first serious test of the season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kyle Hightower"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/patriots_redskins_football_79192_c0-863-1883-1960_s1770x1032.jpg?7225b614a79bda2b044561c0cc267f74008362c8", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
