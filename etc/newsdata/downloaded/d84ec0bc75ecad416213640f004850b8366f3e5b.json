The master suite features a library, a custom floating master bed and five windows that \u201cprovide views past Union Square,\u201d according to Ms. Field.\n\n\n\nThe Nordic-style penthouse is a six-year renovation project dreamed up by S\u00f8ren Rose Studio, a design firm with offices in New York and Copenhagen specializing in interior, product, and industrial design. With floor-to-ceiling windows, plank oak floors and touches of contemporary art, the decor exudes Scandinavian minimalism with industrial accents of the bustling New York.\n\nMore: $8 Million Minimalist\u2019s Dream Home Hits the Market in SoHo\n\n\u201cThere is a visual joke between the studio and the owners about the six painstaking years,\u201d Ms. Field said. That joke comes to life in the form of a tiny \u2018weed\u2019 sculpture by Tony Matelli placed below the stairs, she added.\n\n\n\nThe 17-story building, located in the Flatiron District just one block away from Gramercy Park, was built in 2007. The current owner purchased the property in 2009 under a trust for $6.4 million, according to property records.\n\n\n\nThe floating staircase links a well-lit living room to the home office/bedroom on the mezzanine level, and to the rooftop pavilion, which has a 30-foot-long pool with an infinity glass wall and custom blue mosaic tile. Flanked by the pool are three seating areas, a wet bar, and an indoor-outdoor kitchen.\n\n\n\nA floating staircase Brooke Holm for Sotheby's International Realty\n\nThe rooftop boasts a panoramic northern view of the Empire State and Chrysler buildings and beyond, the listing says.\n\nFrom Penta: Rare Whiskey Remains World\u2019s Best-Performing Luxury Asset\n\nThere are also a number of hidden features powered by home automation technology, including a flatscreen television in the master suite behind a piece of art and a privacy glass and wooden wall in the office, both accessible with the touch of a button.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe owner is a true perfectionist and pays incredible attention to detail,\u201d Ms. Field said. \u201cIt is a journey into bespoke craftsmanship.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Yaling Jiang"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-121442?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
