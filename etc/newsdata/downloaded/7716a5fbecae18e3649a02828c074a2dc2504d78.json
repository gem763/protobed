I would never have expected this out of Australia, a country supposedly governed by the rule of law.\"\n\nMr Huang told The Australian Financial Review these issues were evidence the government had gone out of its way to devise a defence against an invisible enemy, the so-called \"China influence\".\n\n\"This all smells of a complicated political game being hatched behind the scenes,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Huang lost his bid to overturn the freezing orders the ATO has placed over his and his wife's Australian assets including two homes in Sydney\u2019s Chatswood worth more than $3 million and a $13 million Mosman mansion.\n\nLast Friday, in a summary judgment over Mr Huang's tax debt, the Federal Court heard the ATO was seeking to bankrupt him in order to recover the $141 million.\n\nThe tax dispute came at a time when ICAC was questioning whether he had donated $100,000 to the Labor party, a move that was prohibited for a property developer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said during the tax audit, the ATO struggled to prove proceeds from a property sale in China had to be taxed.\n\nThe Tax Office wrongly treated a land-use right assignment fee which had to be paid back to the Chinese government, Mr Huang said, adding that the ATO took several years to investigate the matter.\n\nDuring this time, his adviser, Deloitte, and the Tax Office had open dialogues and were unaware of any major tax liabilities or tax evasion claims, he said.\n\n\"Not once was communication interrupted even after I was barred from returning to Australia on groundless allegations,\" Mr Huang said.\n\nHe said he had not transferred monies in a hurry despite the Tax Office's claims. He was given a due date of October 7 after being sent tax notices on September 11. On September 16 however, the ATO froze his assets.\n\nIn evidence before the Federal Court, the ATO has claimed that Mr Huang moved $47 million out of Australia since his departure in December. It also says that on March 9 he was removed as a beneficiary of four trusts which hold the bulk of his family's assets in Australia.\n\nMr Huang said the last round of money he transferred out of Australia late last year was \"normal\" working capital, not his long-term capital in Australia.\n\nThe developer, who now resides in Hong Kong, said the ATO's actions were \"a blatant violation of his basic rights as a taxpayer.\n\n\"Be it a political donation or an alleged tax burden, it's all fiction. This problem is Australia's greatest threat.\"\n\n\"It makes me wonder if Australian politicians and media outlets are any different from white supremacists or the McCarthyites?\" he said referring to a group worried about Communist influence in the US in the 1950s.\n\n\"The synchronised collaboration between media outlets and government agencies suggest a 'deep state' is at work.\"", "description": "The Australian government has become a 'deep state' turning the ATO into a 'political weapon' in its war against China's influence, Huang Xiangmo says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3064%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_190/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dcb8f0d0b474c2aeb3226711a854938e8750a88a", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
