In a post on Medium, he blamed Blizzard\u2019s \u201cincredibly harsh\u201d punishment of Grandmasters competitor Chung \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Ng Wai.\n\nYesterday, Blizzard announced it would suspend Chung for one year and and pull his prize money after he expressed his support for the Hong Kong protests.\n\nKibler, 39, is a widely-respected Magic: The Gathering player who, in 2010, was inducted into Magic\u2019s Hall of Fame. Over the last couple years, Kibler amassed a 500,000-person following on Twitch streaming Blizzard\u2019s Hearthstone, which he casts in an official capacity for Blizzard.\n\nAussie Studio Offers To Repay Hearthstone Player's Revoked Winnings For Supporting Hong Kong With Blizzard banning Chung \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Ng Wai for a year and stripping his prize winnings over the player's vocal support for Hong Kong during a post-game interview, it was only a matter of time before someone else stepped up. Enter Sydney studio Immutable, the makers of a blockchain-powered collectible card game, and the company pledging to repay all of Blitzchung's lost winnings.

Acknowledging that he thinks Blizzard \u201cwas correct in issuing him a penalty for his actions,\u201d Kibler goes on to say that the penalty was \u201cnot something I can in good conscience be associated with.\u201d\n\nHe continued:\n\n\u201cThe heavy-handedness of it feels like someone insisted that Blizzard make an example of Blitzchung, not only to discourage others from similar acts in the future but also to appease those upset by the outburst itself. . . When I learned about the ruling, I reached out to Blizzard and informed them that I no longer feel comfortable casting the Grandmasters finals at BlizzCon. I will not be a smiling face on camera that tacitly endorses this decision. Unless something changes, I will have no involvement in Grandmasters moving forward.\u201d\n\nKibler\u2019s statement joins a chorus of backlash against Blizzard\u2019s decision. The Blizzard subreddit shuttered yesterday, full of complaints from players\u2014some of whom pledged to quit the game entirely. At Blizzard\u2019s headquarters, where it proudly displays company values like \u201clead responsibly\u201d and \u201clearn & grow,\u201d a big piece of paper covered up the values \u201cthink globally\u201d and \u201cevery voice matters\u201d apparently in protest of Chung\u2019s ban.\n\nAlso at Blizzard yesterday, some employees staged an \u201cUmbrella Protest\u201d against the ban.\n\nKotaku has asked Blizzard how it is responding to the backlash against their decision and has not heard back. Earlier this morning, Kibler was streaming Magic: The Gathering Arena on Twitch to nearly 3,000 live viewers.", "description": "Collectible card game legend Brian Kibler, who casts for Hearthstone, announced today that he will no longer be involved in the digital card game\u2019s Grandmasters competition.
