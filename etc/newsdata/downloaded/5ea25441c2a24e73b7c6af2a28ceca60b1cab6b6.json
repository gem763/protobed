I will not allow some silly clickbait provocation to tarnish my enjoyment of the spooky season. There\u2019s enough of that already, after all: Every Halloween, I stumble across some commentary from mature, sophisticated types insisting the holiday is for children and only children. The complaints of these Citizen Killjoys range from indignant harrumphing about the occasional group of oddly tall, deep-voiced and sometimes bearded trick-or-treaters to eye-rolling about adults dressing up their pets or going to costume parties.\n\n[How to make a spooky Halloween cocktail without hurting yourself]\n\nHonestly, why? Is it going to harm you if you give a fun-size Snickers to a 16-year-old? Is the sun going to fall from the sky because your 40-something colleague thinks it is hilarious to dress her cat up as Yoda? If she can do such a thing without traumatizing the cat, and without the cat tearing her face off in a fit of yowling feline pique, your colleague is probably a Jedi.\n\nMore importantly, Halloween provides one of the few moments post-puberty when one can still associate fear with fun. Once you hit a certain age, most scares come in the form of letters from the IRS, unexpected meeting invitations from HR, public speaking and medical procedures involving the flattening or scoping of body parts. Few of these terrors make for good costumes; fewer still invoke feelings of festivity.\n\n[Make the recipe: The Black Lagoon (pictured above)]\n\nEvery Halloween, friends of ours put on a spectacle in their yard that may be singularly responsible for local decorative gourd shortages. Their yard has hosted a murderous pumpkin monster holding its own decapitated pumpkin head high. It has featured several multi-gourd centipedes, made up of dozens of tiny pumpkins snaking across the yard, culminating in a terrible pumpkin head rising off the lawn to snarl at passersby. There are a host of other chortling jack-o-lanterns as well, usually including an enormous one shooting flames from the top of its roasting head, an effect created by soaking toilet paper rolls in kerosene. Days of labor and dozens of pumpkins of various shapes and sizes go into this production, which involves power tools, fire and, in recent years, a fog machine.\n\nIt warms the cockles of my heart to sit on their front steps on Halloween night and watch as trick-or-treaters come around the corner, see the yard and freak out, their little faces filling with awe, their eyes lit by dancing jack-o-lantern flames. And the adults with them, many of them probably already exhausted from a day at work and dutifully chaperoning anyway, come around the corner and get the same look on their faces.\n\nI try to play two small roles at these annual events: One, I help my friends make sure the various Princess Elsas, dragons, Pok\u00e9mons and genies do not wander too close to a burning gourd. And two, I try to bring a batch of Halloween cocktails and sometimes a punch, so that, along with the baskets of candy, we can offer some adult trick-or-treats as well. If you\u2019re hosting a fearsome fiesta this year \u2014 one that distracts from the daily fearsome fiascos on the front page of the paper \u2014 here are some tips for making spooktacular cocktails.\n\nGo forth and be creepy, my fellow adults, and here\u2019s hoping awful puns are the scariest thing you deal with this Halloween.\n\n\n\nSpooky Sour . (Laura Chase de Formigny for The Washington Post; food styling by Marie Ostrosky for The Washington Post)\n\nGo for the garnish gold. Nothing \u2019ween-ifies a basic drink like some creepy visuals (and nothing ends the fun as quickly as someone choking on one). With a drink like the Spooky Sour, you can keep to the basic recipe or add a little egg white if you want to create a frothy pale surface, allowing you to splatter Angostura bitters \u201cblood\u201d or create more intricate patterns using bitters delivered by eyedropper (Angostura and a few drops of black or red food coloring works great). If you add garnishes that aren\u2019t edible, make sure they\u2019re clean and noticeable and won\u2019t end up getting swallowed accidentally. And if you play around with dry ice, make sure whoever\u2019s handling it stays sober and attentive.\n\n[Make the recipe: Spooky Sour]\n\nShoot for seasonal service. For punches such as the Bob\u2019s Your Apple, thinly sliced rounds of fruit, sprigs of rosemary and thyme, and spices such as star anise and grated nutmeg contribute not only flavor but visual pleasures; they won\u2019t make your punch scary, per se, but they certainly make it seasonal. And having little baby apples to float in the punch will remind people of bobbing for apples without making them do it. (Seriously, when I think of how many times children of the \u201980s stuck their faces into tubs of water that had been snorted and slobbered in by 30 other kids \u2026 it\u2019s a wonder any of us made it out of the Reagan era.)\n\nNot only can you herald the autumn with garnishes, you can do it with the punch bowl itself. I find lots of cheap, vintage serving bowls at local thrift stores, but if you\u2019re feeling ambitious, you could serve a Halloween punch inside a hollowed-out pumpkin. Provided you scrape out the innards well, it won\u2019t impact the taste unpleasantly.\n\nSatisfy the kid inside, and the adult they\u2019ve become. It seems only natural for Halloween drinks to lean a little sweet \u2014 a liquid treat for adults to enjoy while the kids plow through pounds of processed sugar. But most people\u2019s sweet teeth have evolved since they were kids, so keep your drinks balanced and bright. Stick to fresh fruit juices, and try to complement sweeter, richer flavors with tart or bitter ones (as in the Black Lagoon).\n\nRemember: Angostura bitters is the pumpkin spice of cocktails. I mean that in the best way possible: The ubiquitous yellow-capped bitters is loaded with baking spice notes that turn a drink seasonal with just a dash.\n\nKeep the candy corn as a garnish. I test these things so you don\u2019t have to, so I can confirm: It is possible to make a cocktail syrup by melting candy corn, but you\u2019ll get better results if you instead go with flavors reminiscent of this Halloween staple. Honey with a little salt and a drop or two of food coloring will get you a good Halloween orange, without the various other ingredients that give candy corn the texture of pasty candle wax. (Delicious, delicious candle wax.)\n\nRecipes:\n\n\n\nBob\u2019s Your Apple Punch . (Laura Chase de Formigny for The Washington Post; food styling by Marie Ostrosky for The Washington Post)\n\nBob\u2019s Your Apple Punch\n\nThis punch is named for \u201cbobbing\u201d for apples, once a popular Halloween game. Serving it in a punch bowl will be a visual echo of that, as it allows you to scatter pretty (and tasty) slices of apple and other garnishes on top, but you can serve it in a pitcher if you prefer. As specified, the recipe makes 6 to 8 servings. But if you need more, you can double the recipe, or just add more apple juice or ginger ale for a larger but less alcoholic batch. You have plenty of choices for the sparkling apple cider, too \u2014 go with a nonalcoholic type, or grab one of the many good alcoholic versions now available; these will vary in sweetness.\n\nNote: For the apple juice, Red Jacket\u2019s Fuji Apple is nice and bright; regular cider will be richer and darker. Look for a ginger ale with good spice to it, like Fever-Tree or Q.\n\nMake Ahead: If you\u2019re making a block of punch ice, you\u2019ll need to freeze it the night before. A Tupperware container or cereal bowl can create a good-size ice block. You can also prep the punch base (the spirit, vermouth, apple juice and vanilla) the night before, if you like, but wait to add the sparkling ingredients until you\u2019re ready to serve.\n\n6 to 8 servings\n\nIce (preferably a large block)\n\n2 cups fresh, unsweetened apple cider or apple juice\n\n1 1/2 cups apple brandy or bourbon\n\n1 cup sparkling apple cider, or more as needed\n\n3/4 cup spicy ginger ale (see Note)\n\n1/2 cup sweet vermouth\n\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\nSeveral dashes Angostura bitters\n\nMaple syrup (optional)\n\nLemon and apple slices, star anise, cinnamon sticks, rosemary sprigs, grated nutmeg (optional), for garnish\n\nThe night before you plan to serve the cocktail, freeze the water for a block of ice (if using).\n\nWhen ready to serve the punch, place the ice in a large punch bowl. Add the fresh apple cider or juice, brandy or bourbon, sparkling apple cider, ginger ale, vermouth and vanilla, then stir gently to combine. Add the bitters, then taste and add some maple syrup, if additional sweetness is desired. Garnish with thin slices of lemon, apples, spices and rosemary, then generously grate nutmeg, if using, across the surface of the punch.\n\nServe over ice in punch cups or rocks glasses.\n\nSpooky Sour\n\nFor Halloween, it\u2019s possible to make a cocktail syrup out of candy corn, but you\u2019ll get a better-tasting cocktail by faking it: Honey and a little salt get you close to the flavor without all the extra preservatives. If you want a Halloween orange color, just add a bit of food coloring to the syrup.\n\nNote: If you\u2019re serving guests and want to garnish their cocktails with candy corn, it\u2019s best to garnish all the glasses at once. Take a piece of the candy and wet the yellow base slightly, then slide it, pressing gently, along the rim of a cocktail glass. The candy\u2019s soft texture will yield to the glass edge, forming a little slit where the candy corn can sit. Move the glasses carefully to the freezer to chill, and set them out only when you\u2019re ready to make the drinks.\n\nStorage Notes: The simple syrup can be stored in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\n\n1 serving\n\nFOR THE SALTED HONEY SYRUP\n\n1 cup honey\n\n1/2 cup boiling water\n\n1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n\n2 drops each yellow and red food coloring (optional)\n\nFOR THE DRINK\n\n2 ounces bourbon\n\n1 ounce fresh lemon juice\n\n3/4 ounce salted honey syrup\n\n2 dashes Angostura bitters\n\nCandy corn (optional; see headnote), for garnish\n\nMake the salted honey syrup: Combine the honey, boiling water, salt and food coloring (if using). Stir until the salt dissolves and everything is combined. You should get about 1 1/2 cups. Cool completely.\n\nMake the drink: Chill a cocktail glass. Fill a cocktail shaker with ice, then add the bourbon, lemon juice, honey syrup and bitters. Shake hard for 20 seconds, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve into the chilled glass, taking care not to knock off the garnish, if using (see headnote).\n\nThe Black Lagoon\n\nThis inky drink was made for Halloween, but it doesn\u2019t have to stay there. The bittersweet amaro Cynar 70 and sweet creme de cacao work well with blackstrap rum and are balanced by dry sherry. You can make the drink more seasonal with a creepy garnish \u2014 or a bitter chocolate one, since the drink is basically an adult trick-or-treat. Regular Cynar would work, and Cardamaro or Ramazzotti would substitute well, if necessary, but Cynar 70 is ideal.\n\n1 serving\n\nIce\n\n1 1/4 ounces blackstrap rum, such as Cruzan\n\n1 1/4 ounces dry sherry\n\n1/2 ounce Cynar 70\n\n1/4 ounce creme de cacao\n\n1 pinch kosher salt\n\n1 square dark chocolate (optional), for garnish\n\nPlace a large ice cube in a rocks glass. Fill a mixing glass with ice and add the rum, sherry, Cynar, creme de cacao and pinch of salt. Stir briefly to chill and dilute, then strain into the prepared glass. Garnish, if you like, with a square of chocolate placed on the rim of the glass.\n\nAll three recipes from and tested by Spirits columnist M.
