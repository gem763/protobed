The 22-year-old has become the most-decorated gymnast at the world championships among both men and women.\n\nThe U.S. gymnast broke the all-time record at the world gymnastics championships in Stuttgart, Germany, on Sunday when she secured her 24th medal at the event, beating the record for most world medals by men or women, previously set by Belarusian men's gymnast Vitaly Scherbo.\n\nLess than two hours later, she earned a 25th medal.\n\nSIMONE BILES ADDRESSES ESTRANGED BROTHER'S MURDER ARREST: 'MY HEART ACHES FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED'\n\nBiles scored 15.066 on the beam after an almost flawless routine, going for a simpler dismount than the double-double she performed earlier in the championships.\n\nIt's her fourth victory at this year's world championships after team gold Tuesday, individual all-around gold Thursday and vault gold Saturday.\n\nOften described as the greatest gymnast in history, Biles was only briefly tied with Scherbo when she won her 23rd medal on Saturday following a thrilling performance on vault. Of her 24 career world medals, 18 are gold, against 12 of 23 for Scherbo.\n\nSIMONE BILES TIES WORLD GYMNASTICS CHAMPIONSHIP RECORD WITH 23RD MEDAL\n\nShe placed fifth on uneven bars on Saturday, ended any chance she had of winning a medal in all six events \u2014 which she did last year in her comeback world championships after a sabbatical in 2017.\n\nEarlier in the week, Biles broke the record for most individual medals overall by a woman at the world championships. She broke the tie with Russian gymnast Svetlana Khorinka.\n\nBefore becoming the most-decorated world championships gymnast among both men and women, Biles told The Washington Post on Tuesday she believes it's \"really impressive for someone to be able to do that; I guess that\u2019s me.\"\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got a chance to process it yet, but I think we\u2019ll do some celebrating tonight for all of it \u2014 for the team, for the medal count, for the fifth year in a row.\u201d\n\nCLICK TO VISIT THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"Every year, it feels better and better just because we're adding to the legacy,\" Biles told reporters. \"I feel like I never think of records. I just go out there and do what I came to do, which is compete for the country.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Simone Biles has, inevitably, done it.
