Biden and Sanders, considered her top rivals, have already signaled that they are ready to hit Warren on the debate stage.\n\nBiden last week appeared to take a swing at Warren\u2019s strategy of unveiling a slew of detailed policy proposals, saying \u201cwe\u2019re not electing a planner.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders, who has avoided taking Warren head-on so far during the debate, appeared to try to differentiate himself from his fellow progressive senator, calling her \u201ca capitalist\u201d and describing himself as \u201cthe only candidate\u201d who is going to push back against \u201cthe ruling class of this country.\u201d\n\nThe race\u2019s mid-tier candidates, like Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala Devi HarrisO'Rourke hits back at Buttigieg over criticism of his gun buyback proposal Warren leads Democratic field by 3 points in new national poll Analysis: Warren and Booker most cyber-aware 2020 candidates MORE (D-Calif.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg Peter (Pete) Paul ButtigiegO'Rourke hits back at Buttigieg over criticism of his gun buyback proposal Chasten Buttigieg fundraising for husband Pete overseas Progressives fume at Buttigieg, warn him not to attack Warren at debate MORE (D), could also look to stand out by going after Warren. Harris experienced a brief surge in the polls and in fundraising after hitting Biden during the first Democratic debate in June, though she was unable to sustain that momentum.\n\nCan Bernie reassure after heart attack?\n\nThe debate will mark Sanders\u2019s first major public appearance since suffering a heart attack this month. Sanders has said he is resting comfortably at his home in Burlington, Vt., and has opened up about his recent health issues, injecting a more personal touch to his campaign.\n\nSanders, 78, said last week he was \u201cdumb\u201d not to pay more attention to his symptoms amid his strenuous campaign schedule.\n\nSanders could use the debate to further provide reassurances that he is physically fit enough for the White House and address the issue head-on, at a time when there are already concerns about his age.\n\nThe senator\u2019s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, told The Hill in an interview last week that the campaign\u2019s strategy after the health scare is to be as transparent as possible about the situation.\n\nThe debate comes at a critical time for Sanders, who gained a loyal following in 2016 with his insurgent campaign against eventual nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSaagar Enjeti: Tuesday's Democratic debate already 'rigged' against Gabbard, Sanders Ilhan Omar raises .1 million in third quarter Bloomberg rethinking running for president: report MORE.\n\nBut Sanders has seen his momentum stall in the polls as he is overtaken by Warren, a fellow progressive who has proven more successful at capturing attention so far.\n\nA Quinnipiac poll this week showed Biden and Warren running neck and neck among Democratic primary voters and Democratic-leaning independents, while Sanders trailed far behind at 11 percent.\n\nHow do Democrats handle Trump\u2019s attacks on Biden?\n\nBiden has been forced to contend with a series of unproven allegations from Trump, who has claimed the former vice president thwarted a Ukrainian prosecutor\u2019s investigation into an energy company that employed Biden\u2019s son Hunter as a board member.\n\nBiden has strongly denied that, saying the Obama administration sought to remove the prosecutor over concerns about corruption.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks come as the president is facing an impeachment inquiry sparked by a whistleblower\u2019s allegations that he sought to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\nDemocratic candidates have mostly defended Biden so far in the face of Trump\u2019s attacks amid worries that Trump\u2019s campaign could be adopting the same playbook used to attack Clinton over her use of a private email server while secretary of State.\n\nButtigieg told CNN last week that Biden\u2019s son was being held to different standards than Trump\u2019s own children, while Warren has hit Facebook for not removing ads from the Trump campaign featuring baseless allegations about Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine.\n\nBut Democratic candidates will still need to find ways of drawing contrasts with Biden, who retains strong support among key Democratic constituencies like African Americans.\n\nDo Democrats give more momentum to impeachment push?\n\nThe forum will mark the first debate since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiPelosi says Trump sanctions package on Turkey 'falls very short' Graham throws support behind Trump's Turkey sanctions Feehery: Trump may be down, but he's not out yet MORE (D-Calif.) announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, which will likely force the contenders to address the issue on stage.\n\nA number of national polls conducted after Pelosi\u2019s announcement show Americans growing more comfortable with an impeachment inquiry, giving 2020 Democrats leeway to talk more openly about the issue.\n\nMost contenders have already vocally thrown their support behind impeachment. Biden was the latest to do so in a forceful speech denouncing Trump last week.\n\nRep.

Will some of them come back?\n\nThe forum will be the largest single primary debate yet, with 12 candidates, and will also feature the most women on a single debate stage in U.S. history, according to Gender on the Ballot.\n\nHowever, the field could significantly shrink between Tuesday\u2019s debate and the next one in November after the threshold to qualify was increased by the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThe first debate initially featured 20 candidates spread over two nights, but toughened criteria has since left out contenders like Montana Gov. Steve Bullock Steve BullockWarren expresses support for Indigenous Peoples' Day 2020 primary debate guide: Everything you need to know ahead of the October showdown The Hill's 12:30 Report \u2014 Presented by USAA \u2014 Ex-Ukraine ambassador testifies Trump pushed for her ouster MORE (D).\n\nFor the November debate, candidates must garner a minimum of 3 percent in four approved polls or get 5 percent support in single early-state polls out of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and/or Nevada. Additionally, the contenders must bring in 165,000 individual donors and at least 600 individual donors per state in a minimum of 20 states.\n\nSteyer, Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris and Buttigieg, along with businessman Andrew Yang Andrew YangHillicon Valley: Warren takes on Facebook over political ads | Zuckerberg defends meetings with conservatives | Civil liberties groups sound alarm over online extremism bill Saagar Enjeti: Tuesday's Democratic debate already 'rigged' against Gabbard, Sanders Analysis: Warren and Booker most cyber-aware 2020 candidates MORE and Sen.
