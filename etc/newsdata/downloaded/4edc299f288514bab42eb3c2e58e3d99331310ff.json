Pence has avoided the media since the scandal broke, but his allies have attempted to excuse his actions by floating the absurd defense that, when he leaned on Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky, he was completely unaware of Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nLast night, NBC reporter Vaughn Hillyard asked Pence a simple question: Was he aware that part of the reason for the hold-up in aid to Ukraine was to pressure the country into investigating Joe Biden? Hillyard asked Pence four times. Pence refused to answer the question:\n\nHere's Mike Pence repeatedly dodging @VaughnHillyard's question about whether he was aware his administration was holding up aide to Ukraine as leverage to get the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens (via @TheBeatWithAri) pic.twitter.com/TWHOYPWO9O \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 9, 2019\n\nHere are the answers Pence gave instead:\n\n1. I never discussed the Bidens with Zelensky.\n\n2. Our discussion was focused on \u201cbroader issues.\u201d\n\n3. The aid was \u201cin no way connected\u201d to the demand for a Biden investigation.\n\n4. His discussions were \u201centirely focused on President Trump\u2019s priorities.\u201d\n\nNot one of those statements answers the question. When Pence met with Zelensky and was asked about the aid freeze, was he aware that Trump\u2019s priorities were getting Ukraine to investigate his domestic opponents, including the Bidens? Pence won\u2019t say.\n\nThe answer is yes, he was aware. He was given a readout of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky, and when a reporter asked him on September 2 if the aid was being held up to compel the Biden probe, he answered in the affirmative, reframing it in the administration\u2019s \u201ccorruption\u201d code word. If Pence thought he could sustain a defense that he didn\u2019t know what Trump wanted, he would.", "description": "Vice-President Mike Pence actively participated in President Trump\u2019s scheme to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political opponents.
