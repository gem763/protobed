For me, hopefully it\u2019s Ozil.\u2019\n\nWright admits that he doesn\u2019t know what the problem is between the two, but says that Ozil\u2019s creative spark is much missed in the Gunners side.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m very disappointed to see that [Ozil not in the squad] because I don\u2019t think that Arsenal, when you look at Arsenal\u2019s creative stats, they\u2019re not up there,\u2019 continued the former England striker.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re actually not creating as much and they\u2019re conceding more shots on target. So that says to me you need somebody who\u2019s creative to be playing there.\n\n\u2018Mesut Ozil is that guy, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with him and Unai Emery, but for me I think this could be the problem for Unai in the end if Arsenal continue to do what they\u2019re doing.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re waiting for [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang or Pepe, like the other day, to save them. The fact is he should be playing.\u2019\n\nOzil is still in training with the rest of the first team, and showed his immense talent with a trademark finish ahead of the Crystal Palace game on Sunday, but remains unlikely to be involved against the Eagles at the Emirates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Owen Hargreaves calls on Arsenal to be open with the club\u2019s supporters over Mesut Ozil situation\n\nMORE: Darren Bent claims Arsenal could try and sign Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen next summer", "description": "Mesut Ozil has got back-up in his ongoing war with Arsenal manager Unai Emery, with Gunners legend Ian Wright declaring his support for the German.
