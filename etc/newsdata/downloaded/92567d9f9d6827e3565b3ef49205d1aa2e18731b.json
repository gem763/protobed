Here are a few names that might get consideration.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nLeague insiders believe the Redskins could give consideration to offensive coordinator Kevin O'Connell for the team's full-time head coaching job. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Redskins made the first coaching move of the NFL season Monday, firing Jay Gruden and promoting Bill Callahan to replace him on an interim basis. But that\u2019s only a stopgap measure to get through the remainder of a seemingly lost season.\n\nFor the Redskins, the more important task will be sorting through a list of candidates to succeed Gruden on a permanent basis. As that process commences, the debate in and around the league resumes over whether any coaches who are in demand and have viable options elsewhere would consider working for Redskins owner Daniel Snyder and Bruce Allen, his top front-office executive.\n\nIt is a question that has been asked regularly, as Snyder has hired and fired coaches throughout a two-decade ownership tenure in which he has failed to recapture the franchise\u2019s past glories. Yet Snyder has been successful at convincing prominent coaches to work for him, often paying big money to secure them.\n\nMarty Schottenheimer was an established NFL coach. Steve Spurrier was a coaching star when Snyder lured him from the college ranks. Joe Gibbs, the greatest coach in franchise history, was convinced by Snyder to come back for a second go-round with the team. Mike Shanahan was a two-time Super Bowl winner with the Denver Broncos. Gruden was a respected assistant with the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\n\u201cThe hiring part has not been the problem with him,\u201d a veteran front-office executive with another team said. \u201cThe problem has been making it work once the guy gets there.\u201d\n\n[Brewer: Another Redskins coach fired, and his successor already is destined to fail]\n\nStill, those doubts persist, with the franchise at a particularly low ebb. New England Patriots fans were abundant and vocal Sunday at FedEx Field as their team won, 33-7, to drop the Redskins to 0-5. Allen faced pointed questions at a news conference Monday about his role in the team\u2019s woes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all involved in this,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to hide from our record. I don\u2019t want to hide from things that didn\u2019t go the way we wanted them to go.\u201d\n\nAllen called the culture around the team \u201cdamn good\u201d and said \u201cthe pieces are here for a winning team.\u201d But one agent who represents coaches said Allen\u2019s presence in the front office could cause top coaching candidates to steer clear.\n\n\u201cNo coach worth his salt will take the job with Bruce overseeing personnel,\u201d said the agent, who like others in this story spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide a frank assessment.\n\nThat feeling is not universal. Another agent said while candidates should be wary of the Redskins\u2019 situation, coaches will consider the job based on their own career circumstances.\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 early-season decision on Gruden allows them to launch their search for his full-time replacement immediately, if they choose to do so, even while Callahan coaches the team. Callahan, who formerly coached the Oakland Raiders to a Super Bowl appearance, could be a candidate for the full-time job if he does well.\n\nSeveral people in the league said they expect the Redskins to give strong consideration to Kevin O\u2019Connell, their 34-year-old offensive coordinator. Current NFL head coaches Sean McVay of the Los Angeles Rams, Matt LaFleur of the Green Bay Packers and Kyle Shanahan of the San Francisco 49ers are former Redskins assistants. Team officials could want to prevent another young and promising offensive-minded coach from leaving the organization, only to flourish elsewhere.\n\nA pair of former Redskins defensive coordinators could be among the contenders. New York Jets coordinator Gregg Williams was passed over for the team\u2019s head coaching job after Gibbs retired for the second time, and Marvin Lewis is serving as a coaching adviser at Arizona State after his long stint as head coach of the Bengals ended after last season. Former Packers coach Mike McCarthy is out of the league this year but is expected to be a candidate for jobs next season.\n\nCurrent offensive coordinators Eric Bieniemy of Kansas City, Josh McDaniels of New England, Ken Whisenhunt of the Los Angeles Chargers, Byron Leftwich of Tampa Bay, Brian Schottenheimer of Seattle and Kellen Moore of Dallas could be popular head coaching candidates in the next hiring cycle. Whisenhunt is a former Redskins player. So, too, is Buccaneers defensive coordinator Todd Bowles, the former head coach of the New York Jets.\n\nIf Snyder looks to the college ranks, Oklahoma\u2019s Lincoln Riley is coveted by many NFL teams but so far has not been willing to make the jump to the pro game. There is annual NFL speculation about Michigan\u2019s Jim Harbaugh and Stanford\u2019s David Shaw. Former Ohio State coach Urban Meyer coached Redskins rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins in college but retired after last season.\n\nWhichever coach the Redskins hire will be placed in charge of the development of Haskins, taken with the 15th pick in this year\u2019s draft.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have to make this hire with Haskins in mind,\u201d the veteran NFL front-office executive said.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nThe Redskins are starting over after firing Jay Gruden, but in what direction are they headed?\n\nPlayers react: \u2018Sorry we couldn\u2019t get the job done for you\u2019", "description": "The search for Gruden\u2019s full-time replacement can begin now, with an eye toward developing rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins, even as interim coach Bill Callahan finishes the season.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl", "October At Am", "Mark Maske Covers The Nfl For The Washington Post.
