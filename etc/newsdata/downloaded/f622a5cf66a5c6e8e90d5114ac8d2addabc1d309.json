It\u2019s also primed to match the best from Mercedes AMG for long-distance touring.\n\nBased on a brief test, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to drop the Stingray into track mode and set off on a cross-country drive.\n\nThe 2020 Chevrolet Corvette's optional head up display. (Photo: Mark Phelan)\n\nDriving impressions\n\nImproved handling and the ability to use more power aren\u2019t surprises in a midengined car.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t expect the quietest and most vibration-free cabin of any Corvette I\u2019ve driven. It\u2019s not easy to keep engine noise out of the cabin as the engine pounds away 18 inches behind the driver\u2019s ears. Chevy engineers pulled the trick off with traditional insulation and active noise cancellation.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray (Photo: Mark Phelan)\n\nGM-UAW impact: The redesigned Corvette Stingray to be delayed by strike\n\nMore Corvette news: 2020 Chevrolet Corvette C8 Stingray's price and features draw gasps\n\nAdd a very stiff chassis with springs and bushings expertly tuned to lock out road noise and vibration, and you\u2019ve got an interior that\u2019s as peaceful as many luxury sedans.\n\nThe steering is fast and direct, even more responsive than the 2019 Vette, thanks to the car\u2019s lighter nose, a higher ratio and new steering gear.\n\nA new feature that will save owners countless paint chips and minor repairs allows the driver to raise the Corvette\u2019s nose for driveways and to avoid parking blocks. You can even tell the GPS to remember frequently visited spots and raise the nose automatically if you forget.\n\nThe engine announces its presence when you hit the gas, of course. The Vette leaps forward and the engine roars to life. The suspension shifts smoothly at light throttle, but hammers through the gears when you nail it.\n\nThe new Corvette\u2019s dynamics, design and comfort have the makings of a hit.\n\nWhat\u2019s new?\n\nVirtually everything about the Corvette changed when Chevy decided to move the engine from the nose to between the passenger compartment and rear axle.\n\nPutting the engine there means 60% of the car\u2019s weight is over its rear axle, not coincidentally also Ferrari\u2019s preferred ratio. It lends itself to better acceleration, since the weight presses the wheels down, putting more power to the street without spinning them.\n\nA 490-hp 6.2L V8 is mounted behind the passenger compartment. (Photo: Mark Phelan)\n\nBrace yourself for future Corvettes that are even more powerful than the 2019 ZR1\u2019s 755 horsepower, but the current car\u2019s 490 hp already delivers that 0-60 mph in less than 3 seconds.\n\nA fast and smooth dual-clutch automatic transmission connects engine and rear wheels.\n\nThe 2020 Corvette Stingray's shift selector seemed intuitive in a brief test. (Photo: Mark Phelan)\n\nThe 2020 Stingray is the first Corvette that doesn\u2019t offer a manual transmission. The dual-clutch (also called a DCT) is quicker and more efficient than a manual, but Chevy would\u2019ve offered a manual if it could. The problem was that sales would be so small no transmission maker would even bid for the job to develop and make a new manual for the 'Vette. On top of that, there literally isn\u2019t enough room for a clutch pedal in the driver\u2019s footwell. I found it surprisingly roomy, likely enough to stretch and shift your legs during a long drive.\n\nIf you insist on shifting yourself \u2013 seriously? Do you churn your own butter? \u2013 the steering wheel has paddle shifters.\n\nTailored to the driver\n\nThe interior fits like it\u2019s tailored to the driver. An 8-inch touchscreen angled toward me as I sat behind the wheel. Below it on the center console are a computer-style wrist rest, buttons and levers to select gears, a dial for drive mode and a wall of climate control buttons and switches between driver and passenger.\n\nThe midengine layout changed the Corvette\u2019s basic proportions, shortening the hood and lengthening the rear deck. Overall length increased 2.5 inches. The height of the roof is virtually unchanged, up 0.1 inch to 48.6.\n\nThe 2020 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray's 8.0-inch touch screen.

(Photo: Mark Phelan)\n\nIt took cranky baby boomers less time to complain about the Vette\u2019s looks, layout and transmission than to say, \u201cWhere\u2019s the in-dash CD player?\u201d\n\nDistract them with a \u201cBrady Bunch\u201d DVD and go out for a drive. The changes are for the better. The 2020 Corvette Stingray is a landmark.\n\nHow much?\n\nPrices start at $58,900, a bargain for a car with the Stingray\u2019s looks and performance. My test car was loaded with features including:\n\nRemovable carbon-fiber roof panel\n\nPower seats\n\nMagnetic ride control suspension\n\nBlind spot and cross traffic alerts\n\nApple CarPlay\n\nAndroid Auto\n\n14-speaker Bose performance audio\n\nHead-up display\n\nFront and rear high-def cameras\n\nHigh-def video rearview mirror\n\nLeather-wrapped instrument panel\n\nPerformance tires on 19-inch front and 20-inch rear aluminum wheels\n\nIt stickered at $87,800. All prices exclude destination charges.\n\nThe 2020 Chevy Corvette Stingray will go on sale late this year or early in 2020, depending on when production resumes after General Motors\u2019 strike with the UAW is resolved. A convertible will follow a few months later.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nA few omissions from the 2020 Corvette Stingray\u2019s equipment surprised me:\n\nNo tuning dial for the audio\n\nAdaptive cruise control is not available\n\nDriver assistance features like lane keeping assist are not available\n\nNo electric features to improve fuel economy\n\nThere are answers, if not explanations, to several of those. A wheel on the steering wheel doubles as a running dial, but only when you\u2019ve got the audio displayed in the instrument cluster instead of other features like a G-force meter and trip computer.\n\nA small wheel on the 2020 Corvette Stingray's steering wheel doubles as a tuning dial (Photo: Mark Phelan)\n\nChevrolet won\u2019t say this, but I\u2019ll be disappointed if the Stingray isn\u2019t the first non-Cadillac to offer GM\u2019s marvelous Super Cruise hands-free semi-autonomous driving system. I don\u2019t understand why adaptive cruise control, which uses some of the same systems but doesn\u2019t steer the car, isn\u2019t offered from Job 1, but I\u2019m confident there\u2019s more to come in Corvette\u2019s driver-assistance arsenal.\n\nThe lack of electrified fuel-saving features is surprising, more so if Chevy doesn\u2019t have something up its sleeve over the next few model years. Otherwise, the new Vette runs the risk of seeming dated before its time.\n\nOther things to watch include:\n\nLuggage room, a strength of recent Corvettes, falls 16.7% to 12.5 cubic feet. The midengined layout cost the accommodating hatchback of previous Vettes, so the total is divided between a rear trunk and carry-on size compartment in the nose. On the other hand, the upcoming convertible doesn\u2019t lose any luggage space and will be bigger than the 2019 convertible had.\n\nIs it easy for the passenger to reach their climate controls, located on the ridge dividing the two seats?\n\nThe new gear selector seems intuitive in a short drive, but only time behind the wheel will tell for sure.\n\nContact Mark Phelan at 313-222-6731 or mmphelan@freepress.com.
