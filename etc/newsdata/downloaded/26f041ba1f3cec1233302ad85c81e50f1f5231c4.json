They painted their faces with stripes of green, white and red. They celebrated with blowhorns.\n\nFor the first time in four decades, women were allowed to pack into Tehran\u2019s Azadi stadium on Thursday to cheer along with male fans as Iran's national soccer team played a World Cup qualifier against Cambodia.\n\n\u201cIt is truly exciting! Enjoying one of my basic rights for the first time,\u201d Zahra Ahooei, 30, told ABC News as she made her way to the stadium, in between cheerfully sending bursts of air into her horn painted the colors of the Iranian flag. She wore the white team jersey and a matching hat that her husband had given her as a gift.\n\nFIFA, the international governing body, has long obliged the Football Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran, FFIRI, which excludes women from buying match tickets. But after a 30-year-old woman named Sahar Khodayari set herself on fire and died in protest last month following her arrest for trying to enter Azadi Stadium earlier this year, FIFA changed its position.\n\n\u201cWomen need to be allowed to enter football matches freely,\u201d FIFA said in a statement at the time, addressing FFIRI.\n\nSomaye Malekian/ABC News\n\nIn March, Khodayari had disguised herself as a man so she could watch Esteghlal, an Iranian soccer team, play against the UAE\u2019s Al Ain. But once a stadium security officer wanted to carry out a physical inspection, Sahar told the officer she was a woman and was arrested. Since her death, she has become known as The Blue Girl -- a reference to the color of the Iranian team.\n\nOn Thursday, female fans had to use a separate parking area and enter through a women-only own gate, and they were confined to a single section of the stadium.\n\nThe match itself was not a huge draw and most of the seats in the 100,000-capacity stadium, which were available only to men, sat empty. Because only about 3,500 seats were allocated to women, those tickets sold out quickly, and some disappointed fans took to Twitter to complain to FIFA about the ticketing restriction with the hashtag WakeUpFIFA.\n\nInside the stadium, women didn\u2019t miss the chance to shout their demands, besides jubilation.\n\nSome women shouted \u201cSeats are spared, no space for women!\" and \"The Blue Girl, you are missed!\u201d But the demonstrations were quickly quieted by policewomen who patrolled the stadium.\n\nSomaye Malekian/ABC News\n\n\u201cSahar will be greatly missed today,\" Zahra said. \"I am sure everyone will think about her here.\u201d\n\nAnother woman, a 25-year-old teacher named Hedyeh, came to the stadium with her friend, Matina, who is also 25. (The women asked that their last names not be disclosed for their security.) Hedyeh said she was disappointed that so many women were stuck outside the stadium while so many seats were empty.\n\nIn the days leading up to the match, some officials in President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s administration tried to claim credit for the historic moment.\n\nSomaye Malekian/ABC News\n\n\u201cThe entry of women into the stadium is the result of internal efforts, not external pressure,\u201d Ali Rabiei, spokesman of the government tweeted on Monday, a claim that was followed up on Thursday with the spokesman saying he has mediated for letting some women who did not have tickets to enter the stadiums, as PANA reported on Thursday.\n\nBut Iranians quickly rebutted the claims.\n\n\u201cIf women are in the stadium today, it is the result of the #BlueGirl\u2019s death. It's not the government's pursuit of women's demands,\u201d Mojgan Jamshidi, a journalist responded to Rabiei\u2019s tweet on Tuesday.\n\nSomaye Malekian/ABC News\n\nAfter the match, which Iran won handily, FIFA issued another statement and called the day a \"very positive step forward.\"\n\n\u201cThere can be no stopping or turning back now,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cHistory teaches us that progress comes in stages and this is just the beginning of a journey,\u201d the statement added.", "description": "They waved flags.
