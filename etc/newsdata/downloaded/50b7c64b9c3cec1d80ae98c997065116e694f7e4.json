The outfit appears to function as a tight-knit community.\n\nA 2017 picture of its commander, Maj Gen Andrei V Averyanov shows him at his daughter's wedding, posing with Col Anatoly V Chepiga, one of the two men behind the Skripal poisoning.", "description": "The unit is comprised of veterans from Russia's bloodiest wars, including hardened service personnel who fought in Afghanistan, Chechnya and Ukraine.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/21/19511082-0-image-a-29_1570654481823.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
