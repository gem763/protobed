He paints a sinister portrait of NBC News where, according to Farrow, a culture of harassment, self-interest and elite-coddling ultimately led the organization to spike the groundbreaking story of sexual abuse allegations against entertainment mogul Harvey Weinstein.\n\nThat story, of course, has turned into one of the most significant feats of journalism of our time, sparking the #MeToo movement and earning Farrow a Pulitzer Prize. Full disclosure: I\u2019m a former employee at NBC News and so I do have a little insight into the organization. At the time the Weinstein story broke, NBC News President Noah Oppenheim said: \u201cThe notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us.\u201d In fact, that \u201cnotion\u201d is precisely what Farrow claims to expose.\n\nThere are some of the bombshells in this new book. First of all, Ronan reports on a new rape allegation against Matt Lauer. A woman who was working with him in Sochi for the Olympics tells Farrow that the star anchor raped her. Lauer denies the charge and claims their affair was strictly consensual.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the crux of the book is how Weinstein tried \u2014 and ultimately was successful \u2014 to get NBC News to kill Farrow\u2019s story on him. Farrow had to hire his own camera crew and take the story to The New Yorker to get it published. Basically, Weinstein played the fellow elite card. He relentlessly called the big bosses to pressure them. According to Farrow, in one of those calls Weinstein told an NBC executive: \u201cIt was the \u201990s, you know? Did I go out with an assistant or two that I shouldn\u2019t have, did I sleep with one or two of them? Sure. We all did that.\u201d The network executive, Farrow reports, expressed what sounded like sympathy and a promise to look into Weinstein\u2019s concerns.\n\nIf true \u2014 and NBC denies that it was pressured \u2014 these guys appeared to relate to one another as buddies. They were part of the same social \u201cclub.\u201d\n\nFarrow also reports that Weinstein attempted to weaponize Lauer\u2019s misconduct to kill the story. He allegedly threatened to reveal information about Lauer that had been gathered by the National Enquirer. NBC denies that it was ever presented with damaging material about Lauer. But if you choose to believe Farrow\u2019s reporting instead of NBC\u2019s denials, the fact that NBC had its own problems could have made it much harder for the network to hold other powerful men to account for alleged misconduct.\n\nRemember, NBC had the infamous Access Hollywood tape of Donald Trump Donald John TrumpFederal prosecutors investigating Giuliani: report House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman and top Republican to introduce sanctions bill against Turkey Trump lashes out at 2020 Dems, impeachment inquiry MORE and Billy Bush \u2014 Access Hollywood being an NBC property \u2014 but still managed to get scooped on the tape by the Washington Post.\n\nIn another telling exchange, Farrow claims Oppenheim told him that his Weinstein reporting and a related recording would force them to \u201cmake some decisions \u2026 like, is this really worth it?\u201d Oppenheim told Variety, \u201cWe are more confident now than ever in the decisions we made around Ronan\u2019s reporting.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut if what Farrow claims is true, just think about the implications of that reported statement. Weinstein was rich and powerful, with a lot of friends and money for good lawyers, not to mention private investigators. It might be uncomfortable at parties. Other people in \u201cthe club\u201d might be mad. The cost-benefit model of news analysis has favored taking down the powerless who can\u2019t fight back over the powerful who have the money and the connections to put up a fight.\n\nFarrow also has implicated the Clintons. At the time he was reporting the allegations against Weinstein, Farrow was trying to secure an interview with Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonHillicon Valley: Google, Reddit to testify on tech industry protections | Trump joins Amazon-owned Twitch | House to vote on bill to combat foreign interference Saagar Enjeti rips NYT report over attacks on Warren's authenticity House Dems introduce bill to fight social media disinformation MORE on foreign policy. He claims then-Secretary of State Clinton\u2019s publicist Nick Merrill sent him a gem of an email explaining that the \u201cbig story\u201d Farrow was working on was \u201ca concern for us.\u201d In other words, drop the story on Weinstein or no interview. Weinstein had been a big donor to Clinton\u2019s campaign. It ultimately took her an eyebrow-raising five days to issue any sort of statement following the initial New York Times reporting on allegations of Weinstein\u2019s sexual misconduct.\n\nThe whole thing is a sordid stew of elite-coddling and cowardice. It\u2019s also an extreme parable of how the news process too often works. News isn\u2019t judged just on its newsworthiness. It\u2019s filtered through a prism of class solidarity and institutional self-preservation. Matt Taibbi, in his book \u201cHate Inc.,\u201dwrites about the proliferation of news stories that punch down the local restaurant or marginalized citizens \u2014 they\u2019re just so much easier to take on. It\u2019s much more difficult, costly and uncomfortable to challenge those with power \u2014 the banks or the big corporations or the Harvey Weinsteins of the world.\n\nSo what Farrow really exposes with this book is not just how NBC News came to lose out on one of the biggest stories of recent years. He also paints a picture of the ugly underbelly of what honestly could be any of the big news organizations, which tend to reflect the interests and tastes of the affluent. Farrow\u2019s book may reveal an absurdly extreme example of that maxim, but the sad truth is that many in the news media cover for powerful people every day.\n\nKrystal Ball is the liberal co-host of \u201cRising,\u201d Hill.TV\u2019s bipartisan morning news show.
