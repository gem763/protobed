I\u2019m still pretty upset that someone felt they needed to do this to children,\u201d Ms. Zinger said. \u201cIt can cause emotional stress on my child and her development.\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s parents said they reached out to Universal a few days after discovering the video in August and that they were offered a gift card and free tickets.\n\nA Universal Orlando Resort spokesman initially declined USA Today\u2019s request for comment but later confirmed Tuesday that the actor had been fired.\n\n\u201cWe never want our guests to experience what this family did,\u201d Tom Schroder said in a statement. \u201cThis is not acceptable and we are sorry \u2014 and we are taking steps to make sure nothing like this happens again. We can\u2019t discuss specifics about this incident, but we can confirm that the actor no longer works here. We remain in contact with the family and will work with them privately to make this right.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
