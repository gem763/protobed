In a speech in Washington, Clarida didn't say much about what action the central bank may take at its meeting in two weeks in light of the risks and low inflation. He stressed interest-rate policy was not on a preset course and policy makers would make decisions meeting-by-meeting. Officials would assess the risks and will act as appropriate, he added. The Fed has already cut interest rates twice this year \"to provide a somewhat more accommodative policy in response to muted inflation pressures and the risks to the outlook,\" he noted. Clarida's comments represent the last public word from the Fed leadership ahead of the Oct. 29-30 meeting.", "description": "Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday said the economy is facing \"evident\" risks, while inflation remains muted.
