Their role must go well beyond questions of function,\u201d Francis said.", "description": "Vatican City (AFP) \u2013 Catholic bishops gathered at a special Vatican assembly called on Pope Francis Saturday to open the priesthood to married men", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/ddcdcc_synod-brought-184-bishops-vatican-60-percent-hail-amazon-countries-bishops-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
