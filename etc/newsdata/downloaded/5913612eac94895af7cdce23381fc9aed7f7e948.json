It may seem like a rogue AI came up with that sentence based on \u201cThings vaguely affiliated with John Mayer,\u201d but it\u2019s true. You\u2019d think it would be the other way around, but Andy Cohen likes to jam it out on occasion and Jimmy Fallon has yet to partake. Andy has been giving Jimmy three Dead songs a week to master, both studio cuts and bootlegs. And tonight on Watch What Happens Live, Fallon\u2019s gratefulness was tested. He crushed, then did the running man, probably the first time that dance was associated with the Grateful Dead. John Mayer is going to be so proud on Halloween.\n\nRelated", "description": "Jimmy Fallon guested on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, where Cohen tested Fallon\u2019s newfound Grateful Dead knowledge.
