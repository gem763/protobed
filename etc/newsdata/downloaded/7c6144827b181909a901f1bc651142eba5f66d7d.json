(Photo: Nicholas Hunt / Staff, Getty Images)\n\nAll the back and forth this summer over just who would actually be replacing Ben Affleck in the Batcowl was enough Hollywood drama to put our heads in a batarang-worthy spin. But for one of the subjects of that back and forth, Robert Pattinson, they were in part frustrating, because he thought he\u2019d lost out on a part he\u2019s been hoping to have for a while.\n\nPattinson revealed his long game for getting the part of Batman as part of Variety\u2019s newest cover story, which dives deep with the actor about his role in Robert Eggers\u2019 haunting Witch follow up, The Lighthouse, and moving on to Gotham City.\n\nThe initial rumours that he had been cast in Matt Reeves\u2019 Bat-film came while Pattinson was on the way to the Cannes premiere of Lighthouse, sending the actor into a spin of anger and confusion... mainly because he hadn\u2019t actually auditioned yet:\n\nWhen that thing leaked, I was fucking furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\n\nThe reason Pattinson was so angry wasn\u2019t because he was being associated with some superhero project he wanted no part of, having built a post-Twilight career on esoteric, independent films. It was because, despite that, he\u2019d actually had thoughts about becoming Batman for quite some time.\n\nI\u2019d had Batman in my mind for a while. It\u2019s such an absurd thing to say. I sort of had an idea to do it, and I\u2019d been prodding Matt [Reeves]. He didn\u2019t accept any prods. I kept asking to meet him.\n\nEventually Reeves did, and there were enough sparks that \u2014 those premature rumours of his casting aside \u2014 Pattinson did indeed audition, and did so wearing the still-mysterious Batsuit from Reeves\u2019 film:\n\nI put it on. I remember saying to Matt, \u2018It does feel quite transformative!\u2019 He was like, \u2018I would hope it does! You\u2019re literally in the Batsuit.\u2019. You do feel very powerful immediately. And it\u2019s pretty astonishing, something that is incredibly difficult to get into, so the ritual of getting into it is pretty humiliating. You\u2019ve got five people trying to shove you into something. Once you\u2019ve got it on, it\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, I feel strong, I feel tough, even though I had to have someone squeezing my butt cheeks into the legs.\u2019 You\u2019re trying to think of the way to balance, how to bring something new to it and not want to scare people off, and work in the confines of the costume.\n\nWe know how the rest of it goes at this point: Just days later, Pattinson did actually become the Dark Knight, albeit after another round of will-he-won\u2019t-he rumours.\n\nIn the process, he apparently successfully acted on a plan he\u2019d been hatching for far longer than any of us had realised... which, to be fair, is an extremely Batman thing to do! He\u2019s gonna be a fine Caped Crusader.", "description": "All the back and forth this summer over just who would actually be replacing Ben Affleck in the Batcowl was enough Hollywood drama to put our heads in a batarang-worthy spin.
