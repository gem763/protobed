And there's more to come from Youri. He will get better. You saw his power in the first half, driving away from people, setting up the goal. He was excellent.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"With Youri he's got this real focus. He's in the gym, he's doing his work, he's preparing his body constantly for competition. Hopefully his good form can continue and he can develop even more.\"\n\nLeicester have now won six of their last seven games and are starting to be talked about as genuine contenders for silverware this season.\n\nThey next take on Crystal Palace on Sunday hoping to carry on their sensational Premier League form, where they have scored 17 goals in their last four matches.", "description": "The Belgian midfielder was impressive yet again as Leicester beat Burton Albion 3-1 to move into the Carabao Cup quarter-finals", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20754319.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Burton-Albion-v-Leicester-City-Carabao-Cup-Fourth-Round-Pirelli-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
