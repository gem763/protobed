Photo: Showtime\n\nHow lucky are we to be alive in the year 2019 when audiences can once again see the true star power of Kirsten Dunst. She didn\u2019t finally get that star on the Walk of Fame for nothing! Now, our appreciation of Dunst can continue into 2020, thanks to Showtime\u2019s renewal of her dark comedy On Becoming a God in Central Florida for a second season. The show follows her as Krystal Stubbs, a mother trying to get by in a lower-class neighborhood outside Florida in the \u201990s, who tries to out-scam a shady pyramid-scheme business. It also stars Th\u00e9odore Pellerin (Family First), Mel Rodriguez (The Last Man on Earth), and Beth Ditto (the rock band Gossip, of Skins fame). But let\u2019s be real, this is the Kirsten Dunst show, through and through. She also executive produces the show, once meant for YouTube Premium, alongside George Clooney and others. And now, she can show all the stinker-thinkers: This is what a winner looks like!", "description": "Showtime announced a second season of On Becoming a God in Central Florida, the dark comedy about a \u201890s Florida pyramid scheme starring Kirsten Dunst", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/26/26-on-becoming-a-god-in-central-fl.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
