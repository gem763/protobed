Mike Quigley (D-IL) on whether Giuliani had a clearance, Maguire said he didn\u2019t know. Earlier in the session, he had said it was vital for those individuals conducting U.S. foreign policy abroad to have government clearance to do so.\n\n\u201cIn order to be able to handle sensitive information, whether it be diplomatic or certainly intelligence information, one must be vetted,\u201d said Maguire. \u201cThis is the important part of protecting national security. We can't just bring people in and automatically wave a magic wand to put holy water on them to give them security clearance. It is a matter of vetting.\u201d\n\nReached for comment just hours after the hearing concluded, Giuliani dodged several attempts about whether he had a security clearance. Instead, the former New York City mayor said in a text message that he was \u201cnever given classified info.\u201d\n\nAfter The Daily Beast asked again whether Giuliani has a security clearance, he again declined to answer.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter keep chasing irrelevant info,\u201d Giuliani wrote in another text message.\n\nSecurity clearances are typically only granted for people who need the access that comes with it to work in some capacity for the government, according to national security lawyer and security clearance expert Bradley P. Moss. Lawyers representing former or current government employees can also gain clearances related to their legal work, Moss added. A partner at Moss\u2019 firm, Mark Zaid, is representing the whistleblower who first raised concerns about Guiliani\u2019s and Trump\u2019s work in Ukraine; though Moss himself is not.\n\nIf Giuliani does have a security clearance , Moss said it\u2019s \u201cunlikely\u201d that he went through the formal clearance process.\n\n\u201cIf he was granted access to classified information, it is likely it was done on direct orders of the president, who can grant access to anyone he wants,\u201d Moss said.\n\nAs part of his work for Trump, Giuliani reportedly met with associates of Ukraine\u2019s president as well as the country\u2019s top prosecutor. The plans and meetings were apparently meant to both push Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and to pursue right-wing conspiracy theories about the origins of the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign. Giuliani has said that he did so with the knowledge of the State Department and on Thursday morning claimed that he had a \u201cnice little trail\u201d of text messages to prove his communications with Karl Volker, the top diplomat in Ukraine.\n\nAsked for his impression of what Giuliani\u2019s role actually was, Maguire expressed confusion.\n\n\u201cCongressman Quigley, my only knowledge of what Mr. Giuliani does, I have to be honest with you, I get from TV and the news media,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not aware of what he does, in fact, for the president.\u201d", "description": "The president\u2019s personal lawyer was shaping U.S. policy in Ukraine and now there are questions as to why and with what broader government knowledge.", "authors": ["Will Sommer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2916,w_5184,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569522236/RTS1W1CG_xvorg9", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
