Almost. To coincide with the start of New York Fashion Week, the French house has collaborated with the American artist Jonas Wood on a limited-edition textile collection, turning the simple silk square into a canvas worthy of a frame.\n\nLouis Vuitton has a long history of collaborating with artists. This year, the brand worked with Alex Israel on colorful handbags and scarves as well. They\u2019ve also brought names like Sol LeWitt, Takashi Murakami, Richard Prince, Yayoi Kusama, and Jeff Koons into the fold over the years. Wood\u2019s prints have a similar pop to them, featuring orange basketballs, flowers, and and pottery based upon the work of his wife, the artist Shio Kusaka.\n\nNot only is the Louis Vuitton x Jonas Wood textile collection a limited run, but it also launched exclusively in New York on September 6 at the Louis Vuitton Soho Pop-Up at 122 Greene Street, which is open from September 6 through November 15. The collection will be available in stores worldwide from September 12.
