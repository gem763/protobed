She was an innocent girl and was brutally murdered for her strong stance against a wrongdoing.\"\n\nRafi had filed a sexual harassment complaint with police against the headteacher, who along with his accomplice, set her on fire after she refused to withdraw the complaint.\n\nShe recorded a video testimony against the teacher before she died \u2013 an incident that shocked the nation.\n\nThe defendant's lawyer Advocate Mahfuzul Haque however, expressed his hope saying that his clients would be acquitted in the case.\n\nHaque told Al Jazeera that there were many inconsistencies in the arguments from the state's side and that they presented weak witnesses. \"If the judgment is fair, then my clients will be acquitted.\"\n\nBrutal murder\n\nSixteen people, split into five groups, took part in the brutal killing of Rafi after hatching the murder plot for three days, Banaj Kumar Majumder, chief of the Police Bureau of Investigation (PBI) - the main investigating agency of the murder - told Al Jazeera.\n\nMajumder said the mastermind, Sonagazi Islamia Senior Fazil Madrasa principal Siraj Ud Doula gave instructions from jail while his accomplices, including two local ruling Awami League party leaders and several seminary students, executed the plot on April 6.\n\nOn the fateful day, Rafi entered her school to take an exam but one of her classmates named Poppy lured her to the rooftop where five others including three of Rafi's classmates, had bound her hands and feet with a scarf before setting her on fire.\n\nThe PBI chief said the initial plan of the killers was to pass the incident off as a suicide. But it fell through after Rafi managed to come downstairs while on fire because the scarf burned and freed her hands and feet.\n\nIn the ambulance, fearing she might not survive, Rafi recorded a statement on her brother's mobile phone.\n\n\"The teacher touched me, I will fight this crime till my last breath,\" she said in the video. She also identified some of her attackers.\n\nThe court proceedings\n\nMajumder said they had investigated the case and had submitted the charge-sheet on May 29, seeking the death penalty for prime accused Doula and 15 others.\n\nThe trial for the case began on June 10 when the case moved to a Feni district court. On June 20, 16 people, including Doula were indicted by the court.\n\nThe judgment procedure began by examining the case's plaintiff Noman in the court on June 27.\n\nAfter completion of final argument from both sides within six months of the incident, Judge Mamunur Rashid of Feni district's Women and Child Repression Prevention fixed October 24 for delivering its verdict in the case.\n\nThe case caused outrage in and outside Bangladesh, with Prime Minister Hasina vowing that \"none of the culprits will be spared legal action\".\n\nRights groups say the number of rape and sexual assault cases has increased in Bangladesh because authorities have failed to prosecute attackers.\n\nRafi's first attempt to register a case with the police went unsuccessful as the local police station chief dismissing it as \"not a big deal\".\n\n\"The horrifying murder of a brave woman who sought justice shows how badly the Bangladesh government has failed victims of sexual assault,\" Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.\n\n\"Nusrat Jahan Rafi's death highlights the need for the Bangladesh government to take survivors of sexual assault seriously and ensure that they can safely seek a legal remedy and be protected from retaliation,\" she added.", "description": "Nusrat Rafi, 19, was burned to death after she accused her teacher of harassing her - a case that sparked protests.", "authors": ["Faisal Mahmud"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/4/19/f180fa8e099b4838a2053bb0262da4be_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
