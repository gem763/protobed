Giuliani and President Trump have dominated the print and television media. Avid consumers of news can be forgiven for thinking that nothing more important is happening on the Ukraine front these days.\n\nBut they would be wrong.\n\nThe biggest scandal inside Ukraine \u2014 perhaps one of the most consequential in all of Eastern Europe \u2014 is a row between a courageous former central banker and a notorious oligarch. It is a high-stakes battle, with a clear cast of good and bad guys.\n\nLast week, the International Monetary Fund halted assistance negotiations with Kyiv over genuine concerns about corruption in Ukraine\u2019s economy, specifically related to the status of PrivatBank. PrivatBank, long Ukraine\u2019s largest commercial bank, was nationalized in 2016 with the vigorous support from the IMF because the bank\u2019s management, led by oligarch Ihor Kolomoysky, was credibly accused of looting it of billions of dollars.\n\nAccording to an independent report, Privat Bank was beset by self-dealing, theft, money laundering and other malfeasance. Valeria Gontareva, then director of Ukraine\u2019s central bank, made eliminating corruption in the banking sector one of her top priorities. She went on to close more than 80 banks during her three-year tenure. Her crowning achievement was wresting control of Privat Bank from its owners.\n\nMs. Gontareva\u2019s widely praised reforms, including her commitment to transparency, significantly affected Mr. Kolomoysky, who has a longstanding business relationship with a popular actor-comedian who since May is better known to the world as President Volodymyr Zelensky. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in the Northern District of Ohio, along with the FBI, have been investigating Mr. Kolomoysky. Mr. Kolomoysky, who owns the 1+1 television channel on which Mr. Zelensky first rose to fame with his satirical sitcom \u201cServant of the People,\u201d has been exercising some influence on the staffing of the new Zelensky administration.\n\nThe question for Ukraine \u2014 and of great interest to the IMF \u2014 is whether Mr. Kolomoysky, operating under a legal cloud and living in exile in Israel until May\u2019s vote, will avoid facing justice because of his close relationship with the new president.\n\nThis stunning turnabout has made Ms. Gontareva, the central banker, a target of a brutal and vindictive pressure campaign.\n\nShe was run over by a car in London where she was teaching at the London School of Economics. Her house in Ukraine was burned down. A car belonging to her daughter-in-law was torched.\n\nA target of Soviet-style intimidation, Ms. Gontareva rightly fears that the targets of her anti-corruption reforms are now targeting her in revenge.\n\nMs. Gontareva and her backers have said they suspect Mr. Kolomoysky, an accusation he denies. But he\u2019s threatened her before. He recently threatened to bring Ms. Gontareva back to Ukraine \u201con an individual basis,\u201d meaning perhaps to kidnap her. And lest anyone miss any of this subtlety, a coffin as placed in front of her door while she was still working at the central bank until 2017.\n\nIt\u2019s an all-too-familiar pattern for Ukraine \u2014 reports of high-level corruption and a questionable relationship between the president and one of the nation\u2019s most powerful oligarchs. And \u2014 also par for the course \u2014 a judicial hearing about PrivatBank was recently delayed because of a bomb threat. Ironically, Kostiantyn H. Kulyk, the prosecutor who initially investigated Hunter Biden\u2019s work for the state\u2019s gas company Burisma and who is himself a Zelensky supporter, is overseeing the current investigation into Mr. Kolomoysky.\n\nThe Zelensky government is rumored to be considering compensating Mr. Kolomoysky for his PrivatBank losses and possibly returning control of the bank to him. The IMF has strongly warned against this.\n\nThe unfolding scandal in Ukraine does not involve any Americans, but rather a Ukrainian oligarch allegedly trying to exploit his newfound political influence.\n\nThe violent intimidation campaign against Ms. Gontareva, for which the Ukrainian police thus far have not found any culprits, reflects what is most troubling about a critical country\u2019s commitment to the rule of law.\n\nUltimately, what is at stake is Ukraine\u2019s status as a functioning democracy with a bright economic future and the political stability to qualify as an ally worthy of a long-term strategic partnership.\n\n\u2981 Daniel N.
