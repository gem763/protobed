The centre forward reacted fastest after Rui Patricio dived to parry Serhiy Kryvtsov\u2019s header from a corner, and poke the ball across the line.\n\nYarmolenko added the second when outpaced the Portuguese defence to finish a swift counter attack with a low, crisp first-time shot.\n\nPortugal dominated the second half and finally achieved a breakthrough when Stepanenko blocked a shot with his arm, receiving his marching orders before Ronaldo blasted home the penalty to make it 700 goals for club and country.\n\nThe goal was his 95th for Portugal. The 34-year-old is now just 14 goals behind the all-time international record of 109 held by former Iran striker Ali Daei.\n\nWhile the exact number of goals scored by some of the game\u2019s legends is the subject of debate, Ronaldo is agreed to be the sixth player to reach 700 after Austrian Josef Bican, Brazilians Romario and Pele, Hungarian Ferenc Puskas and German Gerd Muller.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo netted his 700th career goal when he converted a 72nd minute penalty in Portugal\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier against Ukraine on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cristiano-ronaldo-111019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
