At the same time, multilateral platforms, including the United Nations and the OSCE, are becoming a place for presenting arguments and not solutions to the problems. The system of military and political checks and balances is falling apart in front of our eyes, while international organizations are unable to stop the process,\u201d Aleksandr Lukashenko said.\n\nThe head of state emphasized that unprecedented tension in international relations, the undermining of the foundations of international security and the growing number of regional conflicts affect most continents.\n\n\u201cWe have already started beating the alarm, calling for an end to the confrontation. Recently, we have been talking a lot about the need for dialogue, confidence-building measures and the search for compromises. Unfortunately, the world is not getting better. Moreover, we are witnessing a new round of strategic rivalry between the so-called great powers, the poles of power. Trade wars and sanctions confrontation are on the rise. The struggle for energy and raw materials is getting tougher,\u201d the president said.\n\nIn his words, numerous armed and frozen conflicts in the Middle East, Asia, Latin America and Europe are not being resolved. He added that increasingly sophisticated methods of struggle are used. For example, Aleksandr Lukashenko cited drone attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, calling them a new, previously unseen precedent. \u201cThus, the world has seen a new weapon, simple, cheap, and accessible to almost every terrorist, but which can cause irreparable damage not only to one state but to the planet as a whole,\u201d said Aleksandr Lukashenko.\n\nPlease visit https://eng.belta.by to get more news from BelTA.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/14/5da4071ba310cf3e97a122dc.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
