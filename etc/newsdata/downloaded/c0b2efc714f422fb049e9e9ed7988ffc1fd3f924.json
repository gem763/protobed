I\u2019m going to send you a signed jersey to put a smile back on your face! Thank you for sticking with us! #WeAreTexans https://t.co/JyKaYHLD26 \u2014 Deshaun Watson (@deshaunwatson) September 10, 2019\n\nA great consolation for Katelyn, presumably.\n\nDrew Brees leads Saints to a last-minute win\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite Katelyn\u2019s reaction, Monday night\u2019s game was a fantastic way to kick off the season for slightly less devoted fans of the sport. In the final minute, Watson and Saints quarterback Drew Brees traded monster drives. With 37 seconds left, Watson threw a 37-yard touchdown to Kenny Stills, and it seemed like that would be the game.\n\nBut Brees had other plans. He put his team in field-goal range and in the final seconds, kicker Wil Lutz won it with a 58-yard kick to give the Saints a 30-28 win.\n\nHouston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson is doing his part to console a young fan.
