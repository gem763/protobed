Photo: Getty Images\n\nOn September 23, the United Nations opened its Climate Action Summit here in New York, three days after the Global Climate Strike, led by Greta Thunberg, swept through thousands of cities worldwide. To mark the occasion, Intelligencer is publishing \u201cState of the World,\u201d a series of in-depth interviews with climate leaders from Bill Gates to Naomi Klein and Rhiana Gunn-Wright to William Nordhaus interrogating just how they see the precarious climate future of the planet \u2014 and just how hopeful they think we should all be about avoiding catastrophic warming. (Unfortunately, very few are hopeful.)\n\nA geologist turned historian of science, Naomi Oreskes is the world\u2019s preeminent chronicler of climate denial and disinformation, primarily thanks to 2010\u2019s Merchants of Doubt, which she co-wrote with Erik Conway. A couple of years later, they collaborated on a work of climate fiction, The Collapse of Western Civilization, and the following year, Oreskes wrote the introduction to the American edition of Pope Francis\u2019s climate encyclical. Her new book, Why Trust Science?, draws on the Tanner lectures she delivered at Princeton University, and was inspired, she says, by all the people who came up to her after lectures to ask how it was she knew whatever it was she was claiming to know. We spoke in early September about how much consensus it takes before we can take action on something like climate change, why people can\u2019t properly process the science we do know, and whether we need to give up on GDP growth to properly address climate change.\n\nAre we in a place of distrust about science, or is it more like disinterest?\n\nThe polls are pretty clear on this. There\u2019ve been several major studies. The vast majority of American people still trust science. However, it is true that in certain particular areas where people feel as if the results of science contradict their values \u2014 their religious beliefs, their political commitments \u2014 then we do see a very substantial rejection in distrust of science. And the obvious places are evolution and climate change, but it creeps up in a few other places as well.\n\nI\u2019m sure that\u2019s right, but when I look at these polls showing concern about climate change at 70 percent or 75 percent or even more, I think, given how tribalized our political culture is and how partisan our worldviews tend to be, the fact that 75 percent of the country believes that climate change is happening suggests to me that for at least a sort of significant minority and maybe a plurality, of Republican identifying Americans, their sense of science is actually overriding their political commitments. Is that not how you see that data?\n\nWell, no, probably I agree broadly. But I think there\u2019s a couple of things I would say there. One is that if you unpack the poll data \u2014 I know you\u2019ve looked at this, and, yes, it\u2019s true, 75 percent of people accept that climate change is happening, but it\u2019s a soft 75 percent. When you probe, do you think it\u2019s serious? Do you think it\u2019s caused by people? Do you think it\u2019s a crisis? The numbers fall.\n\nAnd then the other thing, of course, is why did it take so darn long for this to happen? A big part of my work has been showing that there was a scientific consensus on this issue already by the early 1990s, and of course, that\u2019s also when we have the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. So we should have taken action in 1992, but we didn\u2019t. And why is that? Well, we know that a massive campaign was launched to discredit the science, that the purpose of the campaign was to make people distrust the science.\n\nRight. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m arguing with that premise at all \u2014 obviously there\u2019s an enormous misinformation and denial campaign, which you\u2019ve documented very comprehensively and persuasively. But I wonder, given the scope of this book in particular, whether we should be surprised, even in the absence of that kind of campaign, that it would take 25 or 30 years for a relatively new set of ideas about the physical world to take root \u2014 not just as a scientific consensus but a broader social and cultural consensus. Isn\u2019t that somewhat typical?\n\nYeah, definitely. I totally agree with that. And climate change challenges us in a lot of ways. It challenges a very great geological notion about the insignificance of people in comparison to the vastness of geological time and the power of just physical forces. I mean, I was raised, I was taught as a geologist, that the single most important contribution that geology as a science had made was to persuade us of our insignificance.\n\nAnd it\u2019s one of the reasons that I think it took some scientists time to come to grips with this. Because while climate scientists were saying in the \u201990s that this was real serious, other scientists \u2014 earth scientists, chemists, physicists \u2014 were a bit slower to accept it. And I think a lot of it did have to do with, you know, what we could call the uniformitarian paradigm \u2014 that the Earth was giant, people were small, and it was just not that likely that anything that we could do would really have such a profound impact. I think that explains a certain reticence within the scientific community.\n\nOutside of that community, people were reluctant to accept it, too, even without that training.\n\nI think it\u2019s harder to pin exactly what the deal is there. But I think it relates to this idea that the American way of life is great, that America is the greatest country on Earth, that we live this unbelievably prosperous life. We have large comfortable houses, we drive great cars, we travel so much and that this is a good thing. By and large, I think this is how most of us were raised to think and how most of us feel. And so to register that there are these really these really big environmental consequences \u2014 what the economists call the external costs \u2014 and to come to grips with that and to say that this beautiful, prosperous way of life we\u2019ve built has this fatal flaw that will in the end undermine everything that we have built, and in the end will undermine everything we love about our comfortable lifestyle \u2026 That\u2019s a really, really difficult proposition to take onboard. And I think that\u2019s a big reason why the arguments were easy to accept for people. It\u2019s more comfortable to say, well, you know, we don\u2019t even know if this is really true.\n\nWell, just to pull back to the big subject of your book, how do we know it\u2019s true? At what point can we declare things, just, known?\n\nThe short answer is we\u2019re never certain. We have to accept that uncertainty is a way of life. And so anybody who tries to use scientific uncertainty as an excuse for inaction, well, that\u2019s just hogwash because there will always be uncertainty.\n\nAnd in this case, with climate, uncertainty should be an argument for more action.\n\nCorrect. Exactly. That\u2019s exactly right. And sometimes the scientific community will say, yeah, we actually really do know this, the evidence has all come together. There\u2019s nothing really significant that\u2019s contradictory and it\u2019s not looking like it\u2019s going to change. And that\u2019s the point at which an observer could say, okay, there\u2019s a scientific consensus. But that\u2019s a social process. It\u2019s not logic.\n\nDo you see that consensus as having been reached on climate 30 years ago? Because the science has evolved since then, which suggests at least at an epistemological level, we should always be skeptical even if things are being described as the consensus, because probably they will change or can change to some degree, right?\n\nWell, the some degree is the operative phase there.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd, first of all, you have to be clear \u2014 consensus about what? On climate, I\u2019m talking about the specific claim that the IPCC made in the early \u201990s or mid-\u201990s, which was that climate change was underway and it was being driven by human activity.\n\nThat has really not changed substantially since then. What we\u2019ve done is filled in a lot of details. We understand a lot more about the details of the climate system. We understand a lot more about the cloud feedback, a lot of good work on the so-called dimming effect, ocean heat uptake. But in terms of the basic consensus, I mean in some ways it\u2019s a little frightening to me how little that basic framework has changed, since that tells us that we actually really did have the information we needed to act.\n\nYou have just published a paper with Michael Oppenheimer pointing out the pattern that, when it comes to climate projections, the real-world impacts continue to surpass even very recent projections.\n\nYou said surpassing, but that\u2019s not quite right. What we showed in our work was that there\u2019s a range of estimates that the scientists give. They don\u2019t just say the answer is x, they say the answer is between y and z, with a 75 percent probability of blah, blah, blah, et cetera. The point we made is actually the scientists were right, because the error bars include the actual real-world result. But in most cases those results are at the high end of the estimate of what\u2019s possible.\n\nThat\u2019s not saying that they\u2019re wrong, and it\u2019s not saying new findings are surpassing what was said in previous reports, it\u2019s actually saying that they were correct, but that they were systematically being a little bit too conservative in where they put their mean value or best estimate.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, I think there\u2019s a couple of things going on here. I think one of the things is intimidation. I think the political pressure on the scientific community, even though scientists would like to believe that they\u2019re immune from intimidation, uh, they\u2019re human beings and I think they are influenced. There\u2019s been so much political pressure on the climate science community. To not be \u201calarmist,\u201d to not exaggerate, I think that they\u2019ve bent over backwards. And the result has been the systematic slight underestimation that we talked about.\n\nBut it also has to do with certain intrinsic values of science. Scientists have a certain vision of rationality. And that vision, which goes back to Descartes, is that to be rational is the opposite of being emotional. And this is also leading with a lot of gender stereotypes and gender prejudices. So if you have a result that is very dramatic, it tends to evoke an emotional response. And part of avoiding emotion is to avoid claims that could trigger emotion.\n\nI always tell people they need to read Antonio Damasio, who\u2019s the most important scientist in America, because his work has shown that when you reason, the emotional centers of your brain are involved as well. And when people\u2019s emotional centers are damaged, they make bad decisions. So this is why when I hear people say, you know, well, we have to calm down and be rational about this, we have to put emotions aside \u2014 for me, giant red flags.\n\nSo what is an inappropriate emotional response, from your view, to what we know about the climate and where we\u2019re headed?\n\nI mean, the whole thing is very strange emotionally. Amitav Ghosh\u2019s book The Great Derangement \u2014 of all the people who\u2019ve written on this, he\u2019s the emotionally clearest. I think that title really does sum it up. It is a kind of great derangement. The house is burning down and we\u2019re just sitting around discussing, you know, how much fireproofing we have in the walls or something. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a very strange state of affairs. And it partly arises from the fact that climate change is a slow burn. We don\u2019t really see the house burning down. If we did, we might react differently.\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting metaphor to me because I think the most powerful teaching tool that nature has given us has been the California wildfires \u2014 literally the burning down of houses.\n\nSome of my philosophy friends want to have a big argument about what is causation. Because if you think about tobacco, it did take time to make the argument that tobacco caused death. It\u2019s not like you smoke a cigarette and then you drop dead. You smoke a cigarette, you smoke many cigarettes for 20 years, you get cancer and you die and you die maybe 10 to 15 to 20 years sooner than you would otherwise have died. That\u2019s a pretty serious loss of life, but it\u2019s still kind of delayed. And so in some ways climate change is like that, right? You\u2019ve got a hundred years of greenhouse-gas emissions, but only now, finally, is it reaching the point where we\u2019re really seeing the cancer take root.\n\nRationally, we actually should be panicked. We should be panicked, angry, upset, despairing \u2014 all those things. But of course we all know none of those are really productive. If the house is really on fire, you don\u2019t panic, you stay calm, you pull the fire alarm, you call the fire department, you get out of the house, you put the fire out, and then you figure out how to rebuild the house. With climate change, I think maybe that\u2019s the key thing that we have to try to figure out is what is the rebuilding. We basically have to rebuild our energy economy and how we do that as quickly and effectively as possible.\n\nAnd then I thought Andrew Yang was right the other night when he talked about changing the GDP. I thought that was actually one of the best moments of the night. He said, we aim for what we measure. And GDP is an incredibly destructive measure. It encourages unsustainable economic development. If we could change that and come up with a [measurement] that incorporates sustainability into our economic indicators, then I actually think that could be a game-changer.\n\nTo Yang\u2019s point, we aim for what we measure \u2014 I mean, I think there is wisdom in that. On the other hand, when I look in particular at the climate crisis, I see we have pretty good measures of our carbon emissions. We\u2019ve known that they were quite damaging for a really long time. And we\u2019ve done very little to stop them.\n\nThat\u2019s true, but if you\u2019re a businessman, you\u2019ve got your quarterly profit goals, which don\u2019t include climate considerations. If you\u2019re a country, you\u2019ve got output goals, and if the GDP falls, that\u2019s considered a bad thing.\n\nRight. If emissions go up, that\u2019s bad, but people care a lot, lot less.\n\nWe have a lot of economic policies designed to ensure that the GDP is always increasing. When I was in grad school, one of my smart professors, when we would talk about models, he would say the thing that people always miss in models is that if the conceptualization is wrong, then no amount of fixing of the details is going to solve the problem.", "description": "Historian of science Naomi Oreskes, author of Why Trust Science?, on how much science it actually takes to move public opinion about climate change.", "authors": ["David Wallace-Wells"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/25/25-climate-naomi-oreskes.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
