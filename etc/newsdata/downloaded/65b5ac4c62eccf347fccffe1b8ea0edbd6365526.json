We think there\u2019s a case for a cut in bank rates, possibly as early as next week.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: How much less women earn than men throughout their lifetimes\n\nBut the NIESR does not expect a Bank of England rate cut until March 2020, particularly after Labour signalled it would back plans for a UK general election in December.\n\nIt also released its latest GDP forecasts for the next few years, predicting 2018\u2019s annual growth rate of 1.4% will continue in both 2019 and 2020.\n\nGDP hit from Boris Johnson's Brexit deal More", "description": "Experts warn the new Brexit deal will wipe \u00a370bn off growth by damaging EU trade, hitting the economy harder than Theresa May's deal.", "authors": ["Tom Belger", "Finance", "Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3t1jzHB_YhqdxVv5jexLlw--~B/aD0yNjkxO3c9Mzg2OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/661b55f0-fa61-11e9-9ed4-0606fe2e2dfa", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
