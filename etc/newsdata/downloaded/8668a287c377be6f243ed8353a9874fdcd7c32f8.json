and his supporters - as victims of Washington Democrats.\n\nThe performance revealed a defense strategy largely detached from the allegations Trump faces.\n\nTrump spent little time defending his attempt to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens.\n\nInstead, he cast the impeachment fight in simpler basic terms - a battle between him and the \u2018swamp.\u2019\n\n\u2018They want to erase your vote like it never existed,\u2019 Trump said.\n\n\u2018They want to erase your voice, and they want to erase your future.\u2019\n\nHe added, \"The Democrats' brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country.\"\n\nTrump was by his own admission fired up and off script as he spoke for more than 90 minutes. Few of his political opponents were spared from insults.\n\nDonald Trump defended himself Thursday against the impeachment inquiry against him at his first campaign rally since the investigation started\n\nPresident Trump praised all the red t-shirts worn by his rally goers\n\nTrump campaign is selling 'Where's Hunter?' t-shirts at $25 each\n\nHe said Biden 'was only a good vice president because he knew how to kiss Barack Obama's ass.'\n\nHe called Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar 'a disgrace' and an 'America-hating socialist.'\n\nHe said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was 'really stupid.'\n\nOmar responded on Twitter, 'His hate is no match for our movement.'\n\nTrump turned his cuts to the nation's refugee resettlement programs into an applause line and defended his decision to 'bring our soldiers back home' from Syria, as he faces criticism for abandoning the U.S.'s Kurdish allies to an attack by Turkey.\n\nBefore Trump took the stage, his son Eric warmed up the crowd with an attack on the Bidens.\n\nThe younger Trump asked the crowd for an assessment of how Hunter Biden is feeling and suggested that the familiar Trump rally chant of 'Lock her up' - directed at Hillary Clinton - become 'Lock him up' instead.\n\nThe crowd then chanted, 'Lock him up, lock him up.'\n\nTrump fell about 45,000 votes short of beating Democrat Hillary Clinton in Minnesota in 2016.\n\nHe has had staff in the state since June building a network to turn out supporters next November, and the well-funded Trump campaign says it will spend tens of millions of dollars to try to win the state.\n\n'We are going to win this state,' Trump said Thursday.\n\nProtesters converged on Target Center, Minneapolis' basketball arena, hours before Trump's appearance, eventually packing the streets surrounding it.\n\nMany blew brightly colored whistles handed out by fellow protesters, adding to the din of frequent chants like, 'Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!' - referring to Trump himself.\n\nAn anti-Trump protester with a 'climate justice' t-shirt is removed from the rally at the Target Center in Minneapolis on Thursday\n\n'Impeach' signs awaited the president outside the rally as a protester gives a thumbs up sign in Minneapolis on Thursday\n\nBut Trump supporters were outside too to cheer him on as well. 'Feel the love,' reads the sign held by a Trump supporter\n\nBaby Trump balloons are carried by a counter protester before the rally in Minneapolis on Thursday\n\nMinnesotans braved the rain to protest Trump outside the Target Center in Minneapolis on Thursday\n\nSome clutched helium-filled balloons depicting Trump as a baby, similar to the famed Baby Trump balloon that flew above a nearby building.\n\nLora Torgerson of suburban Inver Grove Heights clutched a sign that read 'Liar Liar Diaper on fire.'\n\n'I'm a registered GOP member, and I've never been more ashamed of our party,' she said. 'I didn't vote for him.'\n\nInside the arena, Lori Glass, a longtime Republican from White Bear Lake, a Twin Cities suburb, dismissed the talking of impeachment with one word: 'Ridiculous.'\n\n'He's done so much for the country,' she said, citing the economy as Trump's top accomplishment.\n\nDemocrats are pressing for impeachment because 'they don't have a good candidate,' she said.\n\nOn Friday, Trump planned a rally in Louisiana against Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards.\n\nAides said Trump is not endorsing one of the GOP candidates in the race before Saturday's election to maximize the chances that Edwards falls below the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff.\n\nNext week Trump is set to hold a rally in Dallas, a GOP stronghold in a state that has grown more competitive for Democrats in recent cycles.", "description": "Thousands of anti-Trump protesters lit bonfires, burned 'Make America Great Again' hats, waved signs, and denounced the president while he held a rally inside the Target Center in Minneapolis.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/05/19572038-0-image-a-39_1570769191266.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
