He was reportedly also a former member of the Unification church, though the organisation has not confirmed this.\n\nThe Unification church said in a statement it was \u201cdeeply alarmed to hear of the family being held in inhumane conditions on a farmhouse in the Netherlands.\u201d Mr van Dorsten \"was briefly a member of our movement in the mid-1980s\", it said, but he left in 1987.\n\nThe church's statement also revealed that Mr van Dorsten\u2019s brother, Derek van Dorsten, remained \u201ca long-time member\u201d of the movement, and is quoted as saying \u201cI have not heard from my brother since 1984\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cIn addition, we are unable to confirm any records of Mr Josef Brunner, the alleged captor, having ever been associated in any way with the Unification church. We are grateful that the six victims in this tragedy are now under the care of the local authorities and pray they will be able to heal from their ordeal with time and professional help.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The 58-year-old is described as a furniture worker who also worked on yachts. He was regarded as \u201can absolute professional\u201d, the report said.\n\nWillem Koetsier, a Unification Church member in Amsterdam, also told the paper that after Mr van Dorsten had left the group, he travelled to Germany where it lost track of him. Mr Koetsier said he thought the man \u201ctogether with someone else\u201d had since started their own cult.\n\nWhen police found Mr van Dorsten in the secret basement, he was apparently ill and in bed, having suffered a suspected stroke two years ago.\n\nAccording to Algemeen Dagblad, at the time Mr van Dorsten joined the Unification movement with his brother in the 1980s, he ascribed \u201csupernatural powers\u201d to himself.\n\nHis wife and the mother of nine known children died in 2004. Three of Mr van-Dorsten\u2019s children have come forward and said they left the family eight years ago. It is possible he has even more children, the newspaper reports.\n\nBefore the family moved to the farm in Ruinerwold, they had reportedly stayed at a caravan park where the children were filmed performing cult rituals including walking in circles. This apparently attracted unwanted attention, leading them to move to the secluded farm.\n\nMr van Dorsten\u2019s children, all aged over 18, are now in the care of the Dutch authorities.", "description": "The father of a family found by police in a secret basement below an isolated farmhouse was previously a member of a controversial religious sect, and may have tried to start a\u00a0cult, Dutch media reports suggest.", "authors": ["Harry Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/16/Ruinerwold-basement-family-netherlands.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
