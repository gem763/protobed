We know you\u2019re sick to death of hearing about payment protection insurance (PPI). We know that for years now you have been bombarded with adverts, articles and appeals to check for PPI.\n\nThere will have been cold calls, texts and probably even fliers through your door urging you to reclaim PPI; in fact, it\u2019s become a whole industry in itself. You\u2019ve had enough of it and, to be totally honest, so have we.\n\nBut it\u2019s nearly over. There are fewer than two months left to complain about missold PPI and to get any compensation due to you; the deadline is 29 August.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAfter that it doesn\u2019t matter how serious your claim; you won\u2019t be able to get the cash you are owed back.\n\nSo far, more than \u00a335bn has been returned to customers who had a legitimate complaint about the way they were sold PPI. Some estimates suggest the total claims pot could be worth \u00a350bn, such was the scale of the scandal.\n\nYet many people out there who could complain still haven\u2019t \u2013 and that could include you.\n\nThe not knowing\n\nIf there\u2019s a chance you have been missold PPI but you haven\u2019t applied yet then you either think it\u2019s too complicated a process or you assume it doesn\u2019t apply to you.\n\nThat might be because you had PPI and it was an appropriate product and you were perfectly happy with it. Or it might be because you were not aware that you had been sold this product as part of a credit deal, which in itself should raise questions about the sales process you went through.\n\nOnline financial forums are full of stories of people who checked for PPI without believing they had a claim only to discover they had been missold and were owed thousands.\n\nOne of the most startling stories comes from Which?, a website that offers a free PPI checker. Brian Good began a claim through the site as he had used a number of different loans in the past, but he did not believe he actually had a claim to make and so did not finish the paperwork the bank sent.\n\nFortunately, that did not stop Which? investigating and it later emerged he was owed almost \u00a318,350.\n\nEleanor Snow, Which? consumer rights spokesperson, says: \u201cBanks have set aside billions of pounds for potential compensation so we urge anyone who thinks they might have been missold PPI to make a general claim, which can be done for free using an online tool.\n\n\u201cEven if you have previously had a claim declined it\u2019s still worth asking your bank to check all of your products as you may still be owed compensation.\u201d\n\nYou won\u2019t know unless you investigate \u2013 and the clock is ticking. So, here\u2019s everything you need to know to find out before you miss out.\n\nWho might have a claim?\n\nPretty much anyone who used credit in the last 30 years may have had a PPI policy attached to it, from loans and credit cards to overdrafts and mortgages. The policies were designed to cover repayments if you became ill, suffered an accident or were made redundant.\n\nThe trouble was, the policies were often missold to people who were not eligible for the cover or who were not even aware they had a policy in place.\n\nAnd an additional ruling, known as Plevin, affects anyone who was sold PPI that was active after 2008, even if they were sold it appropriately: as long as the lender took more than 50 per cent as commission they are due some compensation.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of extra people who are owed compensation \u2013 as long as they do something about it before the end of summer.\n\nRight, how do I claim?\n\nIf you want to check if you had cover before the deadline passes and you lose the chance to claim, you should contact your provider, either directly or using one of the free online forms.\n\nOne such form is available through Which?, or there is a template letter on the Money Advice Service website.\n\nAlternatively, most banks and other lenders have a questionnaire form available on their websites so you can simply directly enquire.\n\nOnce you have approached your lender or former lender, they must provide a response within eight weeks. If they don\u2019t, you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which will then investigate.\n\nStay away from claims management companies\n\nOver the last few years an entire industry of PPI claim management companies has sprung up and these last few weeks are their last chance to get a bite of your compensation.\n\nDon\u2019t be tempted to apply for your compensation using one of these companies.\n\nYou don\u2019t need them. They don\u2019t make things simpler, they don\u2019t do anything you couldn\u2019t do on your own and they do take a substantial chunk of your compensation. Some even charge an upfront fee.\n\nBut in the next few weeks they will be in a frenzy of activity trying to scoop up the last claimants. Just remember, you won\u2019t lose out by not using them, you will simply get to keep the full amount of any compensation you are owed.\n\nJust do it. Now. While you\u2019re thinking about it\n\nThe whole PPI thing is nearly over and soon you won\u2019t need to think about it ever again. So make sure you can draw a line under it by finding out whether you\u2019re owed anything.\n\nOtherwise you might end up wondering if you were due a payout but missed the boat.", "description": "Look, we know.
