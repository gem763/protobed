But she\u2019s actually great \u2013 as is Aisling Bea, who continues to find comedy and light in the hardest of plots and roles.\n\nLiving With Yourself takes a while to get going, and the first few episodes are a bit tough to get through, only really picking up around the end of episode three.\n\nMore: Netflix Matt Bomer hides sinister secret after killer car crash in first trailer for The Sinner 3 Best vegan documentaries to stream on Netflix as The Game Changers launches Aaron Paul admits Breaking Bad: El Camino's alternative ending revealed Brock's letter\n\nBut if you hang in there, it\u2019s a simmering funny tale and a really interesting take on what it means to be flawed. A comedy-drama more than comedy, but the laughs are there. Eventually.\n\nLiving With Yourself is available now on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
