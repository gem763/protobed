But many of the UK\u2019s 1.5 million domestic rabbits lead miserable, disease-ridden lives, research has shown.\n\nOvergrown nails and teeth, gut stasis and dirty backsides \u2013 which can result from poor diets and lead to myiasis \u2013 were some of the most common conditions found in a study of over 6,000 rabbits taken to vets.\n\nThe Royal Veterinary College also found collapse and flystrike \u2013 a condition caused by flies laying eggs onto the rabbit\u2019s fur which then hatch into maggots and eat its flesh \u2013 among the most common causes of death.\n\nAnorexia, which can occur due to conditions such as dental diseases, stomach ulcers or respiratory issues, was also a common cause.\n\nDan O\u2019Neill, a vet who co-authored the research, said the idea that rabbits only needed \u201cminimal care and handling while being fed muesli-type food in a hutch\u201d was misguided.\n\nPet rabbits are cruelly neglected and mistreated in Britain, survey finds Read more\n\n\u201cWe now know that this level of care is completely unacceptable from a welfare perspective,\u201d he said, adding that rabbits should not be kept in isolation.\n\n\u201cRabbits don\u2019t exhibit their suffering like other species so it behoves all of us to prevent and recognise their problems.\u201d\n\nThe study also revealed that the average lifespan of pet rabbits was 4.3 years, although one was recorded as living to 14.4 years.\n\nDomestic rabbits have been kept in Britain since the 1800s, and are now one of the nation\u2019s most popular pets. To date, there are 60 breeds recognised by the British Rabbit Council and over 500 varieties.\n\nConcern has previously been raised about Lionhead rabbits, which are prone to dental problems which can lead to loss of appetite. Their flatter faces, which are often perceived as cute, can also cause breathing difficulties.\n\nJoanna Hedley, another vet and co-author of the research, added: \u201cMany of the key medical issues are still problems that we should be able to completely prevent by appropriate husbandry, diet and health checks.\n\n\u201cBetter owner education is necessary if we are to improve rabbit health and welfare in future years.\u201d\n\nA recent report by the People\u2019s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA), found that while pet rabbits are social animals in need of company, over half \u2013 54% \u2013 in the UK were kept alone.\n\nIt also found three-quarters of owners didn\u2019t know their pet\u2019s current weight or body condition score, while 28% of rabbits were being kept in a hutch or cage that was too small.", "description": "Researchers point to misconceptions about rabbits needing \u2018minimal care and handling\u2019", "authors": ["Amy Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59babcaa03f213f2c21bb1d75185a3a2dfc34319/0_202_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1b77c15690f59e6955c4c11911a53b91", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
