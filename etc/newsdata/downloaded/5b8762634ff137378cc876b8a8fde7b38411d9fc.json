Why? Well, we\u2019re not quite done with summer yet, and it just so happens that, in LA, you can party by the pool even when it\u2019s November. So we\u2019ll be doing exactly that, accompanied by what you might call an extravaganza of our pop culture favs. And it\u2019s all happening at the beautiful Hollywood Roosevelt on November 9th and 10th. Lineup announcements are coming in October, so follow Vulture Festival on Twitter and Instagram for updates. Or, center your life around obsessively checking the festival\u2019s website. That will keep you fully up-to-date on which of your favorite actors, writers, and musicians will be filling out our panels, cast reunions, live podcasts, and more. Because frankly, you cannot miss this year\u2019s festival. It\u2019s not allowed. We will cancel you.", "description": "The 2019 Vulture Festival is returning to the city of Los Angeles on November 9th and 10th, for a full weekend of panels, live podcasts, and more, with a pool-side party to boot.", "authors": ["Anne Victoria Clark"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/30/30-vulture-fest-la-logo-primary-new.w1200.h630.jpg"}
