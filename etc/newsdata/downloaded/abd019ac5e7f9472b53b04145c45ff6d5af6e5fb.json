Now I can stand up for two hours in the exoskeleton and I can do walking cycles for a very long time\", he also said. \"This is a feat for me.\"\n\nIn a two-year-long trial, two recording devices were implanted, one either side of Thibault's head between the brain and the skin, spanning the region of the brain that controls sensation and motor function.\n\nEach recorder contained 64 electrodes which collected brain signals and transmitted them to a decoding algorithm. The system translated the brain signals into the movements the patient thought about, and sent his commands to the exoskeleton.\n\nOver 24 months, the patient carried out various mental tasks to train the algorithm to understand his thoughts and to progressively increase the number of movements he could make. For now the exoskeleton is purely an experimental prototype.", "description": "Paralyzed man hails 'feat' of walking again with robot exoskeleton", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/cyber_security_800x533_L_1411917294.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
