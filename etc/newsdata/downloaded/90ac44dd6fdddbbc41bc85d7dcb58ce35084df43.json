'You can give me elocution lessons! You can tell me what I say that's correct and what I say that isn't'.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"The Queen could probably sense that I wasn't going to give up, so she instructed me to say one word: 'furious'. 'Fyer-ri-ous,' I responded.\n\n\"'No, fee-or-ree-ous,' said Her Majesty, in perfect received pronunciation.\n\nAfter several more attempts, I finally cracked it and Her Majesty exclaimed, 'Yes!' and her finger went up in the air, followed shortly by: 'Not sick as a parrot'.\n\n\"And that was it - my one and only elocution lesson, and from the Queen herself.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nMs Kelly, also revealed the Queen has a small number of rooms in her Buckingham Palace apartment - just a bedroom, private sitting room, dressing room and a bathroom.\n\nHer audiences, with everyone from prime ministers to ambassadors, are held in the room of the same name while guests are sometimes asked to wait in the Empire room.\n\nBut the only people allowed into the Queen's private sanctum are members of the royal family.", "description": "Angela Kelly\u00a0 - who was employed by the royals for 25 years - has revealed she was conscious about her Liverpudlian accent when she first began working for the monarch", "authors": ["Tony Jones", "Neil Murphy", "Image", "Pool Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20749376.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-ROYAL.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
