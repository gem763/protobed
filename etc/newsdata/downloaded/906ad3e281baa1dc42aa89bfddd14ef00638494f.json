How to stay safe", "language": "en", "text": "Robert Ross had never heard of the crime of \u201cSIM swapping\u201d until he became a victim.\n\n\u201cI saw a notification for a withdrawal request from one of my financial institutions,\u201d the tech executive told ABC News. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018That's weird. I didn't make a withdrawal request.\u2019\u201d\n\nWithin 20 minutes, years of savings -- nearly $1 million -- had been wiped out.\n\nABC News\n\n\u201cAnd then I immediately looked at my laptop and I saw that I was being logged out of Gmail, and I look back on my phone and then I saw that I had no service. Between those three things, I knew I was under attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn't just startling,\u201d he added, \u201cit was life-altering.\u201d\n\nABC News\n\nRoss isn\u2019t alone. According to David Berry, a task force agent with the REACT Task Force -- a partnership of local, state and federal agencies, and the private industry, that\u2019s taking on the escalating problem of high-technology crime -- more than $50 million has been stolen through swapping SIM cards in mobile phones within the last three years.\n\nWhat is SIM swapping?\n\nA form of identity theft, subscriber identity module (SIM) swapping, is when a hacker switches your phone number to another SIM card in the hacker's phone, often by contacting your phone provider and using trickery or other means.\n\n\u201cThey'll just call up somebody at a store and they'll convince them that maybe they're the customer,\u201d Berry said. \u201cThey'll also get people that are that are willing to do it for money, so they'll basically bribe employees.\u201d\n\nOnce the hacker has access to your number, they can use it to reset your passwords on accounts it\u2019s linked to, such as emails, social media and some mobile payment services.\n\n\u201cOur phone number is basically our identity and the security of a lot of our other accounts are backed up by being able to get a message to our phone number,\u201d Berry said.\n\nEric Taylor, a hacker turned cybersecurity expert, says SIM card crimes are one of the easiest ways for hackers to crack into someone\u2019s personal accounts. In a demonstration, Taylor was able to use prompts to reset an Instagram account\u2019s password in a matter of seconds without even knowing the username.\n\nABC News\n\n\u201cI can change the [account\u2019s] phone number, and take it off and put my own email and completely just take over the account,\u201d he said, replicating the process on Twitter and Gmail.\n\nInstagram recommends that its users enable two-factor authentication using a third-party authenticator app that does not rely on a text message verification. Google further recommended customers take its Security Checkup \u201cfor added protection\u201d for accounts with the service.\n\nLast month, the FBI sent out a security advisory warning businesses about the growing problem of SIM swapping.\n\nCTIA, the Wireless Association, and major phone providers such as AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint, recommend customers add an extra layer of protection for themselves by using strong PIN numbers and passwords to their accounts.\n\nWhat can you do to protect yourself?\n\nFirst, smartphone users can add a layer of protection by using a third-party authenticator app, such as Google Authenticator and Authy. These apps allow for two-step authentification, but instead of sending the alert to your phone number, they will send it to the app.\n\nAdditionally, check with your mobile service provider to see if they offer the option of adding an extra password or personal identification number (PIN).\n\nIt is also recommended that you don\u2019t use the same passwords and PINs for your different accounts.\n\nLaw enforcement and the American Bankers Association don\u2019t see SIM swapping as a threat to traditional banks as the majority of reported cases involve cryptocurrency accounts, but you may want to be careful when linking your phone number to mobile payment apps such as Venmo or PayPal.\n\nWhat should you do if it happens to you?\n\nIf your identity is compromised by a SIM-swapping hacker, the first thing to do is to call your mobile service provider and report it. Try to get them to disconnect the now-stolen phone number immediately.\n\nAlso, check all of your accounts that are linked to the stolen phone number. Change the passwords and PINs, and delete that number from those accounts. If one of those accounts has been breached, contact that company as soon as possible.\n\nAlso, be sure to visit IdentityTheft.gov and complete the steps necessary to report that your identity has been stolen.", "description": "SIM swapping is a growing crime and it's easy to become a victim.
