Some of the artifacts depicted the wings of Horus, a deity associated with death and resurrection, according to the statement.\n\nThe excavation team uncovered 30 workshops used to produce items such as pottery, which were placed in the royal tombs dotting the surrounding valleys.

He said the site will provide further insight into the lives of the laborers who worked there.\n\n\"We found storage rooms used to hold water and food, as well as a water tank from which the workers would drink,\" he explained.\n\nAll the artifacts are believed to date back to Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty, which spanned from around 1539 B.C to 1292 B.C. The site has proven difficult to excavate until now, Hawass said, adding: \"I had to have over 3,000 stones removed to be able to access it.\"\n\nFinding royal tombs\n\nHawass' team has been researching areas around Luxor, in southern Egypt, since December 2017. As well as making discoveries in the Valley of the Monkeys, the archeologists have been exploring the neighboring Valley of the Kings -- the largest expedition there since legendary British archeologist Howard Carter's in the 1920s, according to the Ministry of Antiquities.\n\nEgypt's new one-billion dollar museum\n\nThere the researchers have thus far discovered one tomb, labeled KV 65, which was found to contain tools used for its construction. They are also looking for undiscovered royal tombs, including those of kings' wives and children buried before the adjacent Valley of the Queens came into use in the Nineteenth Dynasty.\n\nAmong the specific tombs they hope to uncover are those of Egyptian queen Nefertiti and her daughter Ankhsenamun, the widow of Tutankhamun. The team is also looking to unearth the burial sites of King Amenhotep I, King Tuthmose II and Ramses VIII, three prominent pharaohs.\n\n\"I believe we are very close to finding an intact royal tomb,\" said Hawass.", "description": "Archeologists have uncovered more than 30 workshops used by ancient Egyptians to produce decorative items, furniture and pottery for royal tombs.", "authors": ["Nourhan Moustafa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191011042213-01-egypt-archeology-valley-monkeys-1011-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
