'I married this incredible man and this to me is just part of our love story.'\n\n\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex said she felt 'vulnerable' contending with her changing role as a wife and mother. This was compounded, she claims, by negative stories in the press.\n\n\n\n\n\n'I would say\u2026look, any woman, especially when they are pregnant, you are really vulnerable and so that was made really challenging,' she said.\n\n'And then when you have a newborn, you know? And especially as a woman it\u2019s really, it\u2019s really a lot. So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mum or trying to be a newlywed...'\n\nMeghan also revealed her decision to make reference to her position in the world as a 'woman of colour' in a powerful speech in Cape Town at the start of the Sussexes' Africa tour was 'last minute'. She hinted that it was a way of taking back the narrative around her identity.\n\nPhoto credit: Samir Hussein - Getty Images More\n\nThe Duchess addressed the Mbokodo Girls\u2019 Empowerment Program last month with the words: 'May I just say that while I am here with my husband as a member of the royal family, I want you to know that for me, I am here as a mother, as a wife, as a woman, as a woman of colour and as your sister.'\n\n\n\nShe told Bradby: 'When I made the choice to add those words into the speech it was really at the last minute. I said to Harry, \"What do you think if I add this in?\"\u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 it just felt right. He very kindly and supportively said if that feels right, that\u2019s what you should do, because it is true.\n\n\n\n\n\n'Before I was part of this family, that\u2019s how I identify with people and connection, as a mother now, as a wife now, but just as a woman. And as a woman of colour, which has been brought to the forefront in a more prominent way.'\n\nMeghan has previously revealed the questions she has been forced to answer around her ethnicity from others, and candidly discussed how she found her voice.\n\n'While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that,' she wrote in a 2015 essay for ELLE.\n\n'To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.'\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "'I married this incredible man and this to me is just part of our love story.'", "authors": ["Natalie Cornish"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ODQG6cEbvegdI07aDedWRA--~B/aD01MTM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/51c5bdee65fc62c6d6c6ff2d6dec0db6", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
