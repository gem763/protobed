Salinger.\n\nFrom Oct. 18 to Jan 20, 2020, the library will show materials ranging from family photographs to letters to the original typescript for his classic \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye.\u201d The exhibit is called \u201cJ.D. Salinger\u201d and was organized by the library in partnership with the author\u2019s widow, Colleen Salinger, and son, Matt Salinger.\n\nMatt Salinger said that while he plans to release his father\u2019s unpublished writings at some point, the library will not be showing any unpublished material.\n\nJ.D.
