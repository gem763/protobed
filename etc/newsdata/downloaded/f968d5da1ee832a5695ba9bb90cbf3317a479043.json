It was seen as something that old people do, and of little interest to young people. However, thanks to a rise in consumer demand for handmade, one-of-a-kind products, crocheting is making a comeback.\n\nOne person responsible for this revival in Hong Kong is designer and entrepreneur Annie Wong, who runs her own crochet start-up, the Mint Box Studio. She hopes that by hosting workshops and collaborating with different brands, she can keep the crochet trend alive.\n\nWong has spent the past two years building her business. Recently, she teamed up with sportswear brand Adidas for their new 90s Revival Ozweego Collection.\n\n\u201cAdidas and I both concentrate on originality. Their new shoe collection focuses on mix and match: using old elements and merging them with modern styles to make something new \u2013 just like my own business,\u201d she told Young Post.\n\nMeet the sisters who are reviving the traditional art of printmaking in a city obsessed with new technology\n\nWong was lucky enough to discover her passion at a young age. She first learned to crochet from her grandmother, and what started as a hobby gradually turned into a full-time job.\n\n\u201cI lived with my grandmother when I was young. She had been crocheting for many years and was very experienced. Thanks to her, I guess I had the \u2018crocheting genes\u2019 in my blood, so I was keen to learn from her,\u201d she said. \u201cI then studied knitting during my university years in Britain, and that made me want to pursue a career in it.\u201d\n\nUnlike many mainstream shops in Hong Kong, Wong\u2019s studio is full of personality: borrowing from her past experience as a shop window decorator, Wong likes to come up with seasonal displays. Her latest collection of products follows a unicorn theme \u2013 fitting, given the importance she places on originality.\n\nWong discovered her passion for crochet at a young age and recently collaborated with Adidas.

Instead, I find things I enjoy and then incorporate them into my work. For example, if I go to the zoo and see some cute animals, I might use them in my designs later. I like to have a variety of products, though, so I may design them as bags or home decorations rather than plain plush toys,\u201d she explained.\n\nLaunching a start-up is a huge and often stressful undertaking. The first few months after Wong opened Mint Box Studio were some of the hardest she\u2019d ever faced. But she was driven by two things: a love of what she does, and the support of her family.\n\nWhat sets Hong Kong Cantonese porcelain apart from the rest, and why it\u2019s a tradition worth preserving\n\n\u201cAt first when I faced an unsteady income, my family\u2019s support was vital to me,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI believe that passion is the key. If you love what you do, regardless of the obstacles you face, you can do it.\u201d\n\nOf course, it helps when passion is coupled with a steely work ethic. Wong is careful to stay organised and manage her time well.\n\n\u201cAs my work schedule is very flexible, I need to be self-disciplined. Most of the time, I make a weekly to-do list to keep track of my projects. After all, it is very easy to relax too much and become lazy.\u201d\n\nHer advice to students interested in starting their own business is that setbacks are inevitable, so it\u2019s important not to be discouraged by them.\n\n\u201cPersistence is vital when starting your own business,\u201d she said. \u201cAt first, it will be a lot more difficult than you think, but never give up.\u201d\n\nEdited by Charlotte Ames-Ettridge", "description": "First taught the skill by her grandmother, Annie Wong now runs her own start-up, Mint Box Studio, and recently collaborated with Adidas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/1f08b51c-d84d-11e9-80eb-3aa57b6d2433imagehires131431.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
