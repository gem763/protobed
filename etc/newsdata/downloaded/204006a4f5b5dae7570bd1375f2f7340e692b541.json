As he grunts and heaves under the load, she nods approvingly. After he has repeated the exercise a number of times, Vogel says something to him and he gets up and moves on to his next apparatus. The double Olympic champion scribbles something down in her notebook.\n\nOnce, it was Vogel lifting these weights. In this very gym, in fact. Now, one of the greatest track sprinters of her generation is the one doing the coaching. Sixteen months after the horrific training crash which left her paralysed from the chest down, Vogel has returned to work for the German federal police.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been since 2008 on the federal police, and now it\u2019s time to give something back,\u201d she says simply of her decision to return.\n\nThis is not any old gym. We are at the Bundesleistungszentrum Kienbaum, a federal sports complex located about 22 miles east of Berlin, near the border with Poland. The facility is a relic of the German Democratic Republic \u2013 Olympic athletes have been training here since 1952 \u2013 and retains something of an Eastern Bloc feel to it with its charmless residential units and sports halls. But looks can be deceiving. Most of the summer sports within Germany\u2019s high-performance system come here to use its state-of-the-art facilities.", "description": "Kristina Vogel watches as a young athlete bench presses what looks to be about twice his own body weight.", "authors": ["Tom Cary", "Cycling Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cycling/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000209265048-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
