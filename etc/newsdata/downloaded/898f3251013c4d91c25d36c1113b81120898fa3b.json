Of the minority who have heard of Kirwan, roughly a third cannot identify its purpose.\n\nThe findings, believed to be the first public polling about Kirwan, could fuel a race between advocates and opponents to define public opinion on the education overhaul.\n\nThe proposal represents roughly a 22 percent boost in school spending. It would attempt to end widespread disparities and lackluster achievement that advocates say are unjust and put the state at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nWhile the Democrats who control the state legislature say implementing the plan is a top priority, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) has derided it as \u201chalf-baked\u201d and said it would be far too expensive.\n\n\n\nA classroom at Great Seneca Creek Elementary School in Montgomery County. (James M. Thresher/The Washington Post)\n\n[Hogan raising \u2018dark\u2019 money to boost his agenda, stop costly education plan]\n\nThe Washington Post reported last week that Hogan has undertaken a $2 million fundraising push, using a super PAC and a related nonprofit that can accept unlimited donations, to advance his agenda \u2014 including rousing opposition to higher taxes to pay for Kirwan-related initiatives.\n\nThe governor has called Kirwan well-meaning but questioned whether increased spending would fix problems in Maryland schools.\n\nMileah Kromer, director of the Goucher Poll, said the results show there is \u201cbaked-in\u201d support to improve schools in Maryland with higher taxes, but there\u2019s no evidence that residents are convinced the wide-ranging Kirwan proposal would fix schools or is worth the estimated price tag.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s yet to be defined to the public,\u201d Kromer said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s extensive, it\u2019s been developed by experts and meticulously researched, people just aren\u2019t aware of what it is.\u201d\n\nThe plan is named for William E. \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan, the former University of Maryland System president who chaired the advisory group that spent years developing it. It proposes free prekindergarten for all 4-year-olds, higher teacher pay and tougher teacher training, more resources for poor and special-needs students, stricter accountability standards for school districts and more career and technology training for students.\n\nIf implemented, the Kirwan proposals would be the biggest overhaul to public schools in two decades. How to pay for them is expected to dominate debate when the General Assembly reconvenes in January.\n\nLawmakers have floated legalizing and taxing marijuana for recreational purposes as one way to generate additional revenue.\n\nMeanwhile, optimism about the state\u2019s future is at the lowest point since Hogan took office in January 2015, the poll found, with 46 percent saying Maryland is heading in the right direction. That\u2019s a 13-point drop from February.\n\nKromer said the reason for the drop was unclear. Residents remain optimistic about the economy and its future, and Hogan\u2019s overall popularity remains high, with 64 percent of residents approving of the job he\u2019s doing.\n\nThe poll of 763 Maryland adults was conducted from Sept. 13 to 18 by the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Goucher College. Its margin of error is 3.6 percentage points.\n\nScott Clement contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nMaryland advances landmark education bill that boosts funding for public schools\n\nLandmark Maryland education bill to become law without Hogan\u2019s signature\n\nThe long and short of a Maryland school\u2019s dress code sparks protest\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Gov.
