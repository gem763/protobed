We know each other very well and, after the game, we'll have a laugh and joke. But before the game, there's not going to be anything like that.\n\n'It's very competitive and on the pitch, we want to get the better of each other.'\n\nLeicester have lost only once this season and head to Anfield full of confidence.\n\nThe Foxes have won their last three games in all competitions, scoring 11 goals in the process, and 22-year-old Chilwell has highlighted the influence of the senior players.\n\n'There's that backbone of the club that's been there for years now, since we won the league and even way before that,' he said.\n\nLeicester boss Brendan Rodgers spent more than three years in charge of Liverpool\n\n'There are players like Kasper (Schmeichel), Wes (Morgan), Vards (Jamie Vardy), they're the backbone of the changing room. They've been there, they know what the club's about.\n\n'When new lads come in, they make sure that the players know the philosophy of the club and that you play for the badge.\n\n'The lads that have come in have definitely taken to it, there's no bad eggs in the changing room. So there's definitely a lot of leaders in the changing room.'", "description": "'He's been the best full-back in the world, I'd say, and that's not even an exaggeration,' said the 22-year-old left back ahead of his side's encounter with Liverpool, and Robertson, on Saturday.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/13/19296186-0-image-a-38_1570192362711.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
