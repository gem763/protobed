And yet, the way climate activists frame the issue often alienates the very people they most need to persuade.\n\nFirst, the math. Seventy percent of Americans say they want the government to take action to combat global warming. But the Republican Party has, in the last two decades, gone from accommodating a wide range of perspectives on climate change to marching lock-step to the energy industry\u2019s climate denial tune.\n\nMost Republicans, however, don\u2019t work for the energy industry.\n\nOver half of Republican voters identify as conservative Christians\u2014either evangelicals, Catholics, or others. These voters may be right-wing on social issues, right-wing on immigration, and right-wing on \u2018big government.\u2019 But they\u2019re not necessarily right-wing on allowing the Earth\u2019s climate to be radically disrupted\u2014and if they move, the Republican Party will have to move too.\n\nBut according to two new studies conducted by the Yale Program for Climate Communication and published in the journal Science Communication, most religious Christians understand global warming in very different terms from others.\n\nThe first study \u201cfound that \u2018protect God\u2019s creation\u2019 is one of the most important motivations that Christians report for wanting to mitigate global warming.\u201d Resonant messages included \u201cGod made humans responsible for taking care of His creation\u201d; \u201cWe can use nature for our benefit, but it is not OK to destroy God\u2019s garden that He entrusted to us\u201d; and the language of \u201cstewardship\u201d over the Earth.\n\nAnd the second study found that framing the issue of global warming in moral and religious terms was crucial for Christians to care about it, because it suggested that \u201cpeople like themselves\u201d care about the issue.\n\n\u201cPeople derive values, a sense of self, and social norms from the groups to which they belong,\u201d said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program and a co-author of the two studies. \u201cMessages that resonate with group identities may be especially effective in influencing people\u2019s attitudes.\u201d\n\nIn other words, we think the way our group thinks.\n\nIf we believe that no one in our group cares about a certain issue, we\u2019re less likely to care about it. If we believe that our core values have nothing to do with a certain issue, we\u2019re less likely to care about it.\n\nUnfortunately, when one turns to how the issue is framed in public, these messaging frames are conspicuously absent.\n\nFor example, the introduction to next week\u2019s U.N. Climate Action Summit reads, in part:\n\nGlobal emissions are reaching record levels and show no sign of peaking. The last four years were the four hottest on record, and winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen by 3\u00b0C since 1990. Sea levels are rising, coral reefs are dying, and we are starting to see the life-threatening impact of climate change on health, through air pollution, heatwaves and risks to food security. The impacts of climate change are being felt everywhere and are having very real consequences on people\u2019s lives. Climate change is disrupting national economies, costing us dearly today and even more tomorrow. But there is a growing recognition that affordable, scalable solutions are available now that will enable us all to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me\u2014highly educated, privileged, urban-dwelling, and liberal\u2014that language is probably pretty effective.\n\nBut according to the new Yale studies, it will probably ring hollow for the constituency that\u2019s most central to changing the United States\u2019 current intransigence on climate science and climate action.\n\nIndeed, the U.N. language doesn\u2019t even include the \u201cmost important reason to reduce global warming\u201d chosen by both Christians and non-Christians in the Yale studies, namely: \u201cProvide a better life for our children and grandchildren.\u201d\n\nInstead, it provides a bunch of ecological verbiage about coral reefs and food security.\n\nNor, of course, is the problem confined to the United Nations.\n\nThe Environmental Defense Fund\u2014one of the more centrist and mainstream of American environmental organizations\u2014likewise only mentions the environmental impacts of global warming on its page \u201cwhy fighting change is so urgent\u201d: \u201cextreme weather events\u2026 chunks of ice in the Antarctic have broken apart\u2026 wildfire seasons are months longer\u2026 coral reefs have been bleached of their colors\u2026 mosquitoes are expanding their territory, able to spread disease.\u201d\n\nAnd yet it doesn\u2019t provide the primary reasons given by people in general (leaving a better world for our children) or Christians in particular (protecting God\u2019s creation).\n\nOf course, these omissions make sense in some ways.\n\nFirst, obviously, plenty of atheists, Jews, Muslims, and people of other religious backgrounds care about climate change. Especially anyone with kids or grandkids.\n\nBut it\u2019s also unlikely that the people writing copy for climate change websites are religious Christians themselves, and are using language that \u201cpreaches to the choir,\u201d which in this case means other secular environmentalists.\n\nBut if no one speaks in terms that Christians, especially conservative Christians, care about, then climate activists are only going to be talking to themselves.\n\nWhich is exactly what\u2019s happened. Levels of understanding and concern about climate change have more or less plateaued in the last few years. On the political level, nothing is happening. Thirty-four percent of Americans still do not \u201cbelieve\u201d that global warming is being caused by humans, and only 44 percent of Americans say they \u201cworry a great deal\u201d about it. Another recent Yale study found that voters rank it just 17th among issues of concern.\n\nGiven the extreme likelihood of an unprecedented refugee crisis brought on by rising seas and changing crop patterns, mass extinctions, and global food shortages, all of those numbers are shocking. According to the World Health Organization, 250,000 people will die each year from 2030-2050 because of increased rates of malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress.\n\nClimate denial, meanwhile, is now a billion-dollar industry, with energy-funded think tanks, pseudoscience, lobbying, and media campaigns. The energy industry is using the most persuasive, most effective methods to persuade people about global warming. Why isn\u2019t the environmental movement?", "description": "There are ways to persuade America\u2019s biggest religious group, and the GOP\u2019s base, about global warming.
