Fingers crossed the boys do it come March!'\n\nScotland were one of the four group winners in Section C of the Nations League, meaning they will host - as it stands - one of Bulgaria, Israel or Romania in the semi-final play-off.\n\nIf they come through that, there will be a final against potentially Norway or Serbia for a place at next year's European Championship.\n\nIf Scotland do qualify, it will end a 22-year wait for an appearance at a major tournament finals.\n\nSnodgrass (right) comes up against Kyle Walker during a match against England at Wembley", "description": "Scotland midfielder Robert Snodgrass has retired from international duty with immediate effect - despite his side heading towards a vital period in their history.
