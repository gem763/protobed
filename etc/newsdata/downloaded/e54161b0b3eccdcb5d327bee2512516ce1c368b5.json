The brand has decided to expand its catalog into even more home furnishings with a new line of rugs made for all kinds of lifestyles. They\u2019re low maintenance without sacrificing design. Some are made from recycled materials, some are pet and kid-friendly, and others are made from natural materials to blend right in. The Ridge and Prairie Modern are my personal favorites.\n\nGlossier Futuredew: There\u2019s something about applying serum right before bed that seems wasteful. Your face is dewy and supple and you\u2019re just going to bury it in a pillow. That\u2019s what inspired Futuredew, Glossier\u2019s newest launch. It\u2019s one part serum, one part highlighter. It gives your skin that just-moisturized look that will actually last through the day. Layer it under makeup or go bare and bright.\n\nMaster & Dynamic MW07 Plus True Wireless Earphones: True wireless headphones are having a moment. These new ones from Master & Dynamic are punchy and bold. The sound is deep and they\u2019re incredibly easy to wear, even for an over-ear convert like me. The acetate finish is sleek and so much better looking than many other options on the market. 40 hours of battery life, Active Noise-Cancelling, and Ambient Listening Mode (meaning you can still hear the world around you) set these apart.\n\nDims. Home Composed Vanity: If there ever was a vanity that would fit into any home, it\u2019s this one. The Dims. Home Composed Vanity takes under 10 minutes to put together, is coated in a chemical-free paint, and can easily be used as a desk with ample storage. It comes in four styles with an accent color: Nude / Blush, Sage / Powder, Ink / Powder, and Natural.\n\nAway The Expandables Line: There\u2019s a lot to love about Away\u2019s suitcases but there is one downside: hardside luggage doesn\u2019t give you any expanded space. So it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise that Away has stepped up and created The Expandables. This new line of softside suitcases has an easy-access front pocket, plus the ability to expand an extra 1.75\u201d for added room for all of your things.\n\nScouted selects products independently and prices reflect what was available at the time of publish.
