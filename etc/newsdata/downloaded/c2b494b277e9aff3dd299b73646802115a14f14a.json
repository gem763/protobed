(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nThe effort to demonize him now is so obviously driven by his potential Democratic primary opponents.\n\nThe knives are out for Joe Biden.\n\nTo read some of the media accounts, Biden is the latest politician to run afoul of the \u201cMeToo\u201d era. His accusers have followed the usual script, \u201cbreaking their silence\u201d after much introspection. They insist they aren\u2019t looking for fame or book deals; they just want the truth to come out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat truth? Biden is handsy. And, to borrow a Bidenism, this is a big f***ing deal.\n\nBut is it?\n\nI come neither to praise Biden nor to bury him. The allegation that he\u2019s too physically familiar with people \u2014 and not just women, by the way \u2014 is only slightly more shocking than revelations that he talks too much, says weird things, and misuses the word \u201cliterally.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Biden himself might say, \u201cWe\u2019ve known all this about Joe for literally, not figuratively, a billion years.\u201d\n\nYoung\u2019ns could be forgiven for not knowing that Biden is the most motormouthed politician of the past half-century. Everyone in Washington has a story that begins with Biden promising to offer a few brief remarks and ends with the storyteller waking up years later like Rip Van Winkle to Biden saying: \u201cin conclusion.\u201d\n\nAs for weird remarks, it\u2019s a myth that he shouted at an intern, \u201cMy hovercraft is full of eels!\u201d But Biden did say at an event, \u201cStand up, Chuck, let \u2019em see ya\u201d to a man in a wheelchair. He also told Katie Couric that President Franklin D. Roosevelt went on TV to reassure the public after the 1929 stock market crash. FDR was elected in 1932. TV wasn\u2019t introduced to the public until 1939.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there\u2019s the word \u201cliterally,\u201d which for Biden means: \u201cSome too-good-to-check hyperbole is about to come at you like a rabid spider monkey.\u201d He once said that hardworking Americans were \u201call of a sudden \u2014 literally, not figuratively \u2014 they were decimated.\u201d Literally decimated would mean one out of ten of them were killed. He told students in Africa, \u201cYou are the keystone to East Africa \u2014 literally, not figuratively, you are the keystone.\u201d\n\nAs for exaggerations, Biden has a trillion of them. On the raid to kill Osama bin Laden: \u201cYou can go back 500 years. You cannot find a more audacious plan.\u201d Suck it, Napoleon, Churchill, and Eisenhower!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there\u2019s the handsy stuff. Biden is overly familiar with people. He touches and hugs them a lot. He rubs women\u2019s shoulders uninvited. He sneaks up on them and smells their hair \u2014 which, admittedly, is the sort of thing you\u2019d expect from a sex offender at a public library.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that\u2019s the thing: It\u2019s not that.\n\nAs with the rest, we\u2019ve known this about Biden for a long time. Conservatives had great fun with it under President Obama. Just Google the videos and images of Biden touching women like a chef testing the produce.\n\nHillary Clinton once told Biden she thought he and her husband Bill were so similar they must have been \u201cseparated at birth.\u201d She meant it as a compliment. Really. But there\u2019s no evidence Biden ever behaved in the allegedly sexually predatory way, or in the non-allegedly adulterous way, Bill Clinton behaved.\n\nWhat Biden has in common with Bill is a particular kind of politician\u2019s mix of insecurity and arrogance. It drives them to think they can win over anybody, sometimes by simply talking them to death. Biden\u2019s touching is part charm offensive, part power move. It\u2019s a way to make a human connection. It\u2019s also a way to signal that he has the social authority to invade your personal space. It\u2019s of a piece with his belief that everyone should feel fortunate to listen to him spend an hour offering a few brief comments.\n\nI never liked Biden\u2019s act, but the effort to demonize him now is so obviously driven by his potential Democratic primary opponents. I don\u2019t think it will work. It may cost Biden with young activists in the party who think even gendered pronouns are triggering. But there\u2019s a reason he leads the polls. Democrats may be unified in their opposition to President Trump, but I think the older ones (who tend to vote at a higher rate in primaries) are also nostalgic for \u201cnormal\u201d politics. Biden is more liberal than people claim, but he\u2019s a known quantity, and he\u2019s not a socialist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat may be why the left wing of the party is out to get him. It\u2019s also why he would be a formidable nominee.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency LLC", "description": "The effort to demonize Biden now is so obviously driven by his potential Democratic primary opponents.
