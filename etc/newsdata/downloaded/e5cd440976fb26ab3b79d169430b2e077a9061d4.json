The statues are not damaged,\u201d he said, adding that this was \u201cgood news.\u201d\n\nFrancis went on to say that the Commander of the Italian Carabinieri police wanted to inform the synod participants \u201cbefore the news becomes public,\u201d while adding that the figurines are currently being held in the office of the Commander of the Italian Carabinieri.\n\nThe Carabinieri police will be happy to follow up on any directive regarding the statues, Francis said, for example, \u201cthe exposition of the statues during the closing Mass of the Synod.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will see. I delegate the Secretary of State to answer this,\u201d the pope said.\n\nAs Francis remarked, the story of the statuettes, their installation in a Catholic church, and their eventual eviction has indeed caused a major stir both in Vatican circles and beyond.\n\nOn Thursday, the former head of the Vatican\u2019s doctrinal office weighed in on the question, insisting that the Amazonian \u2018idols\u2019 depicting a naked pregnant woman should never have been placed in a Catholic church.\n\nThe wooden figurines had been presented to Pope Francis at a prayer ceremony in the Vatican gardens in early October and subsequently transferred to Santa Maria in Traspontina until they were removed from the church last Monday.\n\nA video of the expulsion of the figurines from the church immediately went viral, while the Vatican\u2019s communications director Paolo Ruffini downplayed the incident as a \u201cstunt.\u201d\n\nCardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller, the former Vatican doctrinal czar, said that the true crime was not removing the idols from the church, but allowing them in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe great mistake was to bring the idols into the church, not to put them out. Because according to the law of God himself, his first commandment, idolatry is a grave sin. And not to mix them with the Christian liturgy,\u201d Cardinal M\u00fcller said.\n\n\u201cSo putting them out can be against human law, but to bring the idols into the church was a grave sin, was a crime, against the divine law. There is a deep difference,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAnd so it is worse to bring those into the church, not to take them out,\u201d he concluded.\n\nIf, as the pope suggested as a possibility, the statues are displayed in Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica for the closing Mass of the Vatican synod Sunday, this new episode will likely overshadow any other news story emerging from the synod meeting.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Pope Francis said statues of a fertility goddess may be placed in Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica for the final Mass of the Amazon synod.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
