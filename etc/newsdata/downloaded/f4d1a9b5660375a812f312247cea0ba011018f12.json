Only 402 of the reported cases last year led to prosecutions, slightly more than the 380 during the 2014-2015 period.\n\nLast year, Her Majesty\u2019s Chief Inspector of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) found that London police failed to record 94,500 crimes, representing 10.5 per cent of all crimes committed in the capital. The report also found that almost one in ten sexual offence crimes were not recorded by the London police.\n\nSex assaults are not the only crimes rising on the UK\u2019s railway systems. A report from The Scotsman showed that British Transport Police responded to 1,438 attacks on train staff in Scotland in the past five years, with Mick Cash from the railway union the RMT warning of a \u201cculture of violence and abuse\u201d on the country\u2019s rail systems.\n\nBreitbart London reported that thefts on the London Underground surged 80 per cent over the past three years, up from 3,730 in 2016/17 to 6,825 in 2018/19.", "description": "Reports of sexual crime on Britain\u2019s railways have nearly doubled over the past five years, however, most cases go unpunished.", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/British-Transport-Police.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
