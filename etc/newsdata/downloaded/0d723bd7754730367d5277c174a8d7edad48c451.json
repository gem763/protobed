While he'd already been hoping to revive the characters of Jay and Silent Bob \u2013 lovable Jersey Shore drug dealers introduced in his 1994 debut \"Clerks\" \u2013 the shocking health scare changed everything, he says.\n\n\"When I was on the (operating) table, I was told I had an 80 percent chance of dying and I was OK with that, relatively speaking,\" Smith says. \"I was like, \u2018I had a great life, and you can\u2019t be selfish and greedy. If this is the end, this is the end.\u2019\n\n\"The only regret I had though was, \u2018Man, if I die tonight, the last movie I made was (the 2016 horror comedy) \u2018Yoga Hosers\u2019 and that doesn\u2019t say much about who I was. It certainly doesn\u2019t say that he expected to die very soon, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have ended with this.\u2019\"F\n\nKevin Smith suffers massive heart attack: 'For now, I\u2019m still above ground!'\n\n'Way to unload on a teen girl': Kevin Smith speaks out about daughter's online harassment\n\nKevin Smith (left) and Jason Mewes revive their familiar onscreen personas for \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot.\" (Photo: KYLE KAPLAN)\n\nInstead, Smith returns with \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,\" in theaters Oct. 15 and 17 via Fathom Events. The \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot Roadshow,\" a tour of screenings and question-and-answer sessions, launches Oct. 19 in Asbury Park, New Jersey.\n\nIt's a continuation of the View Askew interconnected cinematic universe Smith launched with \"Clerks\" 25 years ago, then expanded with \"Mallrats\" (1995), \"Chasing Amy\" (1997), \"Dogma\" (1999), \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" (2001) and \"Clerks II\" (2006).\n\nThis time around, Jay and Silent Bob journey to Hollywood to sabotage an attempted reboot of a film inspired by them, which is set to be directed by none other than Kevin Smith. Along for the ride is Milly, the daughter Jay never knew he had, played by Smith's 20-year-old daughter, Harley Quinn Smith.\n\nIt's a playfully self-referential premise but Smith, now 49, says he was determined to make a film that stood as a heartfelt document of who he was, how he lived and what he believed in.\n\nJay (Jason Mewes, left) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) head to Hollywood in an attempt to sabotage a reboot of a film inspired by them. (Photo: KYLE KAPLAN)\n\nIt's little surprise that Smith, who has dropped more than 50 pounds and adopted a vegan lifestyle, has made his now-slimmer onscreen persona Silent Bob vegan as well.\n\n\"The idea is you watch this flick and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, well, I know exactly who the director was. Boy, he\u2019s in every frame of the movie; when he\u2019s not Silent Bob, he\u2019s playing himself. It\u2019s kind of gross. But clearly he was a big fan of himself and loved all of his friends and his interconnected movies and New Jersey,'\" Smith says. \"It\u2019s a real testimony to who I was, and I get to make the testimony. As opposed to somebody else giving me flowers after I\u2019m gone, I gave myself flowers.\u201d\n\nMuch of the film's emotion \u2013 including a few moments likely to cause tears \u2013 is rooted in the very real connection between Jason Mewes, who is also a dad, and Harley Quinn Smith.\n\n\u201cBecause he was standing opposite Harley, who he\u2019s known since she came out of the womb, for heaven\u2019s sake, it was a different story,\" Smith says. \"She got a better performance out of the guy because as she stands in front of him tearing up, he just instantly reacts because he\u2019s like, \u2018That\u2019s Harley and she\u2019s sad.\u2019\n\n\"She got him to emote without even trying, so she was a secret weapon in that way inasmuch as I was like, \u2018Wow, who knew that we were going to get Jason to squirt a few (tears)?\u2019\"\n\nKevin Smith (left, with Jason Mewes) calls his new \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot\" a \"nostalgia bomb of a movie.\" (Photo: KYLE KAPLAN)\n\n\"Reboot,\" which Smith described as \"a nostalgia bomb of a movie,\" is surely his definitive statement on himself as an artist and a person, but it's also a love letter to those who have stuck by him all this time.\n\n\u201cMaking people laugh with Jay and Silent Bob, that\u2019s the standard, you have to do that going in, and I\u2019m happy to do that,\" Smith says. \"After a quarter of a century, Jason and I know how to mine laughs out of Jay and Silent Bob.\n\n\"But this time around, the exciting thing was mining emotions out of Jay and Silent Bob that weren\u2019t just glee and giddiness. Like, (we were) going for what the kids call \u2018the feels.\u2019\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/11/kevin-smith-heart-attack-jay-and-silent-bob-reboot/3926070002/", "description": "Kevin Smith returns to his View Askew universe with the heartfelt sequel 'Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,' which hits theaters via Fathom Events.", "authors": ["Alex Biese", "Published A.M.
