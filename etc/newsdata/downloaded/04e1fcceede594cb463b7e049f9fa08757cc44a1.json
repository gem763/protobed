Are you that supple?\"\n\nThose tuning in at that moment would have received a shock as Ben appeared to shove Kate's leg almost above her head.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nBut he was actually using the legs of a luminous white mannequin to try and fool viewers.\n\nRealising they weren't tricking anyone, Ben put Kate's heels on the mannequins feet then acted in the role of the physiotherapist.\n\n\"That's a lovely stretch,\" said Kate as she moaned and groaned.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nBen, who gritted his teeth and pushed hard, asked: \"Do you think we fooled them?\"\n\nGrinning Kate replied: \"Yeah, I'm that flexible.\"\n\nThe pair suddenly realised that they had broken one of the mannequin's legs off.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nGood Morning Britain viewers took to Twitter after watching the hilarious moment.\n\nOne viewer said: \"Think @benshephard is loving @kategarraway legs this morning look at the flexibility on them\"\n\n\"Amazing what you can do at your age Kate ha ha,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"Looks a bit rude from my angle but think they enjoyed the moment\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThis came after Kate had showed off footage of her receiving \"what is essentially a lap dance\".\n\nShe sent the secret clip to Ben and of course he posted it on social media - receiving 122,000 views.\n\nSusanna said: \"Are we allowed to show this at this time in the morning? You look incredibly flexible in that footage.\n\n*Good Morning Britain airs weekdays on ITV at 6am", "description": "The Good Morning Britain presenters tried to fool viewers - but it all went slightly wrong", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20638989.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RLP_MDG_18652JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
