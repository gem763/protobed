Mitt Romney, R-Utah, would attack Democrats as freely as he attacks President Trump.\n\n\u201cI would be more tolerant of Mitt Romney\u2019s concerns about Trump if he was equally strong in his condemnation of House Democrats,\u201d he said, noting Democrats' \u201cun-American\u201d impeachment inquiry. \u201cSomehow he every once in a while shows up, says something bad about Trump, gets some press coverage, and I think that\u2019s sad.\u201d\n\nGingrich said Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, is \u201csmarter than that\u201d and he has \u201cgreater potential than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe give us some balance,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not all occurring in isolation.\u201d\n\nRomney earlier this week noted he still voted with Trump 80 percent of the time.\n\nTrump and Romney have feuded with regularity in recent years, with Trump regularly referencing Romney\u2019s 2012 defeat against incumbent President Barack Obama.\n\nA few weeks back, Trump branded Romney a \"pompous 'a--'\" who \"choked\" in his own run for the White House.\n\n\"Somebody please wake up Mitt Romney,\" the president tweeted. \"If Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won.

I don\u2019t think Mitt Romney matters in the long run of American political history,\u201d Gingrich told Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Monday. \u201cHe certainly does not matter in a Donald Trump Republican Party. I think he is a fossilized element of a party that is disappearing.\u201d\n\nGingrich made the remarks in reaction to a piece published in The Atlantic on Sunday titled \u201cThe Liberation of Mitt Romney.\u201d The story detailed how the seasoned Utah senator now considers himself free of party constraints and instead, if necessary to secure his legacy, would consider a vote in favor of impeaching Trump.", "description": "Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich on Tuesday told Fox News host Sean Hannity he wished Sen.
