Until now, however, it\u2019s been toggling back and forth between Miles and Miles 2.0, mostly as a means to understand how a man and his clone can veer away from each other, even though they share the same DNA and the same memories. Yet the third major character on the show, Kate, hasn\u2019t gotten the same treatment through the first half of the season, leaving her merely to react to the confusing and upsetting situation that Miles\u2019 actions have wrought in her life.\n\n\u201cVa Bene\u201d adds that missing dimension, and it\u2019s the strongest episode of the show so far. For one, we see that Aisling Bea has a comic voice of her own, much saltier and leveling than Paul Rudd\u2019s ingratiating silliness. But more than that, we get an idea of how Kate feels about her marriage, her life in the suburbs, and the quiet desperation that grips her just as surely as it does her husband, even if she doesn\u2019t get herself cloned because of it. In fact, we learn that both she and Miles both attempted to draw from the same special account on the same day, each privately trying to improve their lives without the other. Miles gets there first with the $50,000 spa fee, so Kate can\u2019t put down money on fertility treatment \u2014 which she\u2019s ready to make regardless of whether he\u2019s the donor or not. They are simultaneous responses to a mutual longing for change.\n\nWe\u2019ve understood by implication that Miles\u2019 dissatisfaction with his life has something to do with the cookie-cutter dimensions of his suburban home and a marketing job that\u2019s sucking the life out of him. But \u201cVa Bene\u201d flashes back to a time when he and Kate approached this phase with hope and happiness, a long 1,837 Days B.C. (Before Cloning). The episode begins with Kate waking up in a hospital after a failed fertilization treatment, which she\u2019s told isn\u2019t technically a miscarriage but seems like one anyway. Their hilariously callous doctor offers an analogy: \u201cI know this feels like a tragedy, but it\u2019s not the Hindenburg. It\u2019s more like whatever the first plane Orville and Wilbur crashed. We don\u2019t even know the name. And they eventually flew just fine.\u201d\n\nBut Miles and Kate\u2019s plane never did get off the ground, and 1,800-plus days later, he\u2019s long since abandoned the process\u2014and, by extension, the marital plan as they understood it. \u201cVa Bene\u201d does an excellent job giving context to the entire show while finally allowing us to see Kate\u2019s own struggles close up. As we discover, the failed fertilization had only deepened her resolve to have children and the Miles of five years earlier was excited to accommodate her. He drives her from their home in the city to the suburbs, a place that she never imagined living before. (\u201cI smell something not entirely terrible.\u201d \u201cThey call it \u2018grass.\u2019\u201d \u201cGrass? Like in the movies?\u201d) When touring the McTwoStory they eventually buy, Kate\u2019s reservations about the homogeneity and chintziness of the \u2019burbs is borne out, but she\u2019s seduced anyway. There\u2019s a lot of space, the schools are good, and there\u2019s a nice corner bedroom for the baby.\n\nMiles and Kate are making the most common decision here\u2014even diehard city-folk, who love the restaurants and culture and liveliness that go along with it, are wooed by considerations like living space and quality schooling. But what happens when the kid doesn\u2019t materialize? It\u2019s not entirely clear that Miles and Kate\u2019s marriage would be in trouble even if they\u2019d become parents, because it\u2019s also common that children expose the problems in a relationship more than they solve them. Yet they move to the suburbs out of a nesting instinct and without a child, they\u2019re\u2026 well\u2026 just living in the suburbs. Even the one household item meant to give specific life to a generic place, a credenza, has become a glorified junk drawer that Miles bangs into at night.\n\nAll of these events lead up to the revelation at the end of the last episode, when Miles 2.0 logged onto the Da8er-dot-com website and discovered Kate\u2019s profile as the perfect match. In a serendipitous twist, Kate had the unctuous CEO of Da8er as a client for her interior architecture business and that experience inspired her to post her profile the night before Miles cloned himself. Whereas the Kate we saw before \u201cVa Bene\u201d didn\u2019t seem like the type of person to look for romance outside her marriage, the episode makes a persuasive case for why she would. After getting kicked out of the house, Miles 2.0 has moved back to the city, a place where Kate had once known happiness before Miles turned into an ornery shit.\n\nSo now, Kate is stepping out on Miles with Miles 2.0, which in effect is stepping out on current Miles to date the Miles from five years ago. It would be a fascinating experiment to see if Kate and this Miles learned from their mistakes and set their life together on a different course, but there are still two Mileses and now the wacky screwball scenario of a woman having an affair with her husband\u2019s clone. Wherever things go from here, it\u2019s good for the show to know where she\u2019s coming from.\n\nDouble Yous:\n\n\u2022 Kate\u2019s filthy line-readings, starting with \u201cIt\u2019s like my granny used to always say, \u2018When life gives you lemons, try anal\u201d recall Sharon Horgan on Catastrophe. Horgan and Rob Delaney were similarly frank in that regard, but there\u2019s something to be said for the contrast in tone between Aisling Bea and Paul Rudd. They have their own unique spark.\n\n\u2022 Nice detail: The long-ago flashbacks show Miles painting an elephant in a hot-air balloon in the baby\u2019s room. In a quick shot five years later, the same room is a space for boxes and other random junk, like a larger version of the credenza.\n\n\u2022 \u201cHow am I supposed to host micro-dose mixers with fat veins?\u201d Kate\u2019s horrible client is perhaps a little overwritten, but credit to Timothy Greenberg for dreaming up the most awful-sounding soiree imaginable.\n\n\u2022 If you\u2019re looking for that catchy Celtic number that closes the episode, there\u2019s a recording of middling quality up on YouTube.", "description": "The strongest episode of the show so far proves that Kate \u2014 and Aisling Bea \u2014 has a comic voice of her own.
