The heavily-promoted iPhone launch event \u2014 as has been the case the past few years \u2014 was panned as incremental news that could easily have been disclosed in a press release. Some tech pundits even suggested that Apple \u2014 gasp! \u2014 discontinue its early September iPhonefest.\n\nRecent iPhone sales worldwide reflect the sentiment, especially as tensions escalate over the impact a trade war with China will have on Apple hardware products. Apple has lost significant market share the past year to smartphone rivals Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi Corp. 1810, +1.20% , makers of cheaper and feature-packed handsets that dominate the market in China, the world\u2019s largest for smartphones. Indeed, queues at Apple\u2019s Beijing and Shanghai stores on Friday combined were a few dozen, compared to hundreds in previous years, according to a Reuters report.\n\nYet there was Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook at the renovated Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan on Friday, basking in loud applause as pumped-up customers waved their newly purchased iPhone 11 models this Friday. News organizations, including MarketWatch, slavishly reported the festivities a day after Apple was named the country\u2019s most relevant brand for the fifth year in a row in the annual Brand Relevance Index from Prophet.\n\n\u201cDemand looks strong out of the gates for Apple as the lines at its flagship NYC store were up 70% today compared to what we saw last year,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in an effusive note Friday.\n\nApple has acknowledged its flagship product is losing steam through its product strategy and several high-profile management changes. For the first time in nearly seven years, iPhone sales accounted for less than half of its quarterly revenue, according to its third-quarter earnings report released Aug. 1. Sales of iPhone were $25.99 billion, down sharply from a year ago, when iPhone revenue totaled $29.47 billion. In the same quarter a year earlier, iPhone comprised 63% of total revenue.\n\nRead more: The iPhone just did something it hasn\u2019t done in nearly 7 years, and it isn\u2019t good for Apple\n\nCook has made no secret Apple is shifting its revenue-growth reliance to software and services. Its previous big event in March focused on the Apple TV+ streaming service, and Apple shared news of its pricing ($4.99 per month) last week. The company has also parted company in recent months with three principal figures closely associated with iPhone: Steve Dowling, head of communications; design boss Jony Ive; and retail chief Angela Ahrendts. Apple, in essence, has air-brushed part of iPhone history.\n\nRead more: Apple design should be fine without Jony Ive\n\nBut you can\u2019t argue with marketing success. Even as Cook reshapes his executive team and Apple pivots strongly to content, one thing is unlikely to change. As long as reporters show up en masse at Apple product events, consumers line up at Apple Stores in the U.S., and Cook receives a hero\u2019s welcome on retail day \u2014 and it is dutifully covered \u2014 Apple won\u2019t mess with a cliched albeit effective PR strategy.\n\nApple shares declined 1.5% on Friday, giving it a market value of $984 billion.", "description": "It\u2019s become a late-summer ritual: Lines of consumers snake around Apple Inc.\u2019s retail stores on a Friday in New York, San Francisco and all points in between...", "authors": ["Jon Swartz", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR770_Cook_ZG_20190920125642.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
