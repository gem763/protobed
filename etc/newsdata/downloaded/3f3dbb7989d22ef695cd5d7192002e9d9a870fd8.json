Then-Mayor Abe Beame called New York\u2019s stock-transfer tax of the late \u201970s the \u201clargest single obstacle to the competitive position of the New York financial community\u201d and thus a burden on the entire city economy.\n\nAnd of course Biden\u2019s tax would also hit not just \u201cthe rich,\u201d but every American who has a 401(k), pension or similar retirement plan.\n\nThis is apparently Biden\u2019s effort to compete with the Warren-Sanders \u201cwealth tax,\u201d which would hit not income or transactions, but everything the target owns.\n\nWarren rolled out her plan in January to target the \u201crichest 0.1 percent of Americans.\u201d The tax would take 2 percent of all household net worth above $50 million, and 3 percent of assets above $1 billion \u2014 every year.\n\nLast week, Sanders saw Warren\u2019s bid and raised it while declaring \u201cbillionaires shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d His graduated wealth tax starts kicking it on assets of $32 million, hitting 180,000 families to Warren\u2019s 75,000.\n\nHappily, the idea clearly fails the Constitution\u2019s ban on direct federal taxation of individuals: The 16th Amendment let the feds tax incomes, but only incomes.\n\nIt\u2019s also disastrous policy: Nearly every European nation that\u2019s imposed one has opted to repeal it, because the wealthy move rather than pay \u2014 or spend some of their cash finding ways to protect the rest.\n\nEven Bernie\u2019s beloved Sweden gave up on the idea in 2007, and Denmark before that. France repealed its in 2017, and Norway is phasing out its wealth tax.\n\nOf course, Warren and Sanders don\u2019t care much whether it would work (or at all about the Constitution). They\u2019re just appealing to the huge Democratic left, which likewise doesn\u2019t care about facts, but only its dreams of redistribution.\n\nAnd it seems to be working: Warren, at least, is passing Biden in the polls and may now be the frontrunner. And so Biden feels the need to offer his own \u201canti-billionaire\u201d tax, continuing his move far to the left of even President Barack Obama.\n\nAt this rate, the Democratic nominee is going to wind up as \u201celectable\u201d as Karl Marx.", "description": "The ex-veep\u2019s advisers, says the Post, are weighing coming out for a tax on \u201ctransactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds.\u201d", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/joe-biden-5.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
