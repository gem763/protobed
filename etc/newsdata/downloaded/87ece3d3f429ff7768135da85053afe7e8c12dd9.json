A deal could be closed as soon as next week, both outlets reported.\n\nBoth reports said WeWork could run out of money as soon as next month without new financing. That timeline is much shorter than previous estimates, including by Business Insider. Those earlier projections indicated that WeWork, without another cash infusion, could most likely last until the middle of next year.\n\nRead this: WeWork could face a cash crunch as soon as February. Industry watchers think SoftBank, its lenders, and the entire industry has too much at stake to let it go under.\n\nA JPMorgan spokeswoman, Tasha Pelio, declined to comment on the reports. Representatives for WeWork did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nWeWork's cash is running low\n\nThe amount of new funds said to be under discussion is about a quarter larger than previous reports suggested the company was seeking, adding a further indication of the pressure it's under.\n\nWeWork was planning to raise some $3 billion in an IPO last month, a move that would have unlocked another $6 billion in debt financing from JPMorgan and other lenders. When the IPO fell through, so too did the original debt deal.\n\nThe company would pay a high price for the new loans. The interest rate would reportedly be significantly higher than the Libor rate plus 4.75 percentage points it was set to pay under the previous, but now canceled, debt deal, according to the two reports.\n\nSince the company shelved its IPO, WeWork has ousted its CEO, Adam Neumann, and numerous executives, made plans to sell off or shut down subsidiaries, including its WeGrow private school, and put its corporate jet up for sale.\n\nGot a tip about WeWork or another company?
