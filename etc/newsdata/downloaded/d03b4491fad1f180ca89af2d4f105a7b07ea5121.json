Holder, who led the team at the last two 50-over World Cups, will continue to lead the side in test cricket.\n\n\u201cWe believe Kieron Pollard is the right person at the right time now to lead the West Indies team in white ball cricket,\u201d CWI President Ricky Skerritt said at a news conference.\n\n\u201cJason Holder is a very important force and he is still going to be our red ball captain.\u201d\n\nPollard will begin his captaincy by travelling to India for a series against Afghanistan. They will play three T20s followed by three ODI matches in November.\n\n\u201cIn the short term as captain, the immediate aim is to defend the T20 World Cup,\u201d Pollard, 32, said. West Indies will be defending their T20 World Cup title next year in Australia.\n\n\u201cOne of the discussions I hope to have is to bring back the idea of specialists playing in their best positions,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played all over the world and I hope to use this experience to help the West Indies in my role as captain.\u201d\n\nThe once mighty West Indies, who won the first two editions of the World Cup during the 1970s, finished ninth in the 10-team standings at this year\u2019s tournament, winning only two of their nine matches.\n\nSkerritt said that the CWI had reviewed a flawed selection policy and will now pick players based on various criteria such as form, fitness, performance, team balance and commitment.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we found in our one-day team shortcomings is over 50 players were picked between the 2015 and 2019 World Cups,\u201d Skerritt added. \u201cIt made little sense and the results showed.\u201d", "description": "West Indies all-rounder Kieron Pollard has been named as the new captain of their one-day international and Twenty20 teams, the country's cricket board (CWI) said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428043441&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881LG", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
