Couldn\u2019t be more proud. Fell in love with these characters just like everyone else did but sadly Netflix thought it was time to close the curtains and so here we are. They gave us a home for 6 beautiful years. Nothing we could do about it. \u2014 Aaron Paul (@aaronpaul_8) September 27, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaul\u2019s choice of words has subsequently fuelled fan rumours that Netflix actually cancelled BoJack, despite reports that creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg intended to end the show after its sixth season.\n\nNetflix haven\u2019t commented on the speculation, nor have they supplied any official explanation for why BoJack is ending after six years on the streaming platform.\n\nFurther rumours about the end of the show have since gathered pace, with some fans linking developments at the show\u2019s animation and production studio, The Tornante Company\u2019s ShadowMachine, to the decision to bring BoJack to an end.\n\nThe artistic crew successfully negotiated a deal to unionise with The Animation Guild (TAG) back in June, a goal they had reportedly been seeking ever since production began on the first season of BoJack back in 2014.\n\nThe deal ensured that the BoJack crew at ShadowMachine receive a minimum wage, and employer-paid retirement and health benefits.\n\nThey did it! The #BoJackHorseman crew ratified a new contract today and has unionized with #TheAnimationGuild! Congrats to this crew for their hard work and dedication and thank you for all the support from fellow artists and fans! #unionizebojack #valueartists #artistsunited pic.twitter.com/Us2Yc38CUW \u2014 The Animation Guild (@animationguild) June 21, 2019\n\n\u2018This crew was organised, determined, and showed their resolve and solidarity throughout the process,\u2019 Jason MacLeod, a TAG representative, said in the summer.\n\n\u2018We congratulate the crew on this result and are glad to see that this successful show will be a union production going forward.\u2019\n\nRegular BoJack director Aaron Long has since moved to clarify that there isn\u2019t a link between the animators\u2019 unionisation and the end of BoJack, emphasising that the decision to bring the show to an end with season six was sealed long before the crew joined TAG.\n\nIf it wasn't already set to be the last season, unionizing probably wouldn't have helped\u2026 but please just know the Bojack artists didn't kill the show by demanding the same pay as Big Mouth and Paradise PD! \u2014 Aaron Long (@aalong64) September 28, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Please just know the BoJack artists didn\u2019t kill the show by demanding the same pay as Big Mouth and Paradise PD,\u2019 Long added.\n\nNews about the end of BoJack also follows on from the actual cancellation by Netflix of the ShadowMachine-produced Tuca & Bertie, which was executively produced by Bob-Waksberg.\n\nBoJack Horseman returns for part one of season six on 25 October on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
