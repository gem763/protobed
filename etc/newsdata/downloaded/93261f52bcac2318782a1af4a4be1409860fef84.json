More recently, it formed the basis for an Emmy-winning TV series starring Elisabeth Moss.\n\nCanadian author Atwood, 79, won the 2000 Booker Prize for The Blind Assassin. She was also shortlisted for the prize in 1986, 1989, 1996 and 2003.\n\nThe Testaments will be published just after midnight on 10 September. Later that day, Atwood will talk about the book at a National Theatre event that will be shown in cinemas around the globe.\n\nFlorence, one of the few to have read the book, describes it as \"a savage and beautiful novel that speaks to us today with conviction and power\".\n\nLucy Ellmann - Ducks, Newburyport\n\nImage copyright Galley Beggar Press\n\nBorn in Illinois in 1956 and now based in Edinburgh, Ellmann is the only US author on this year's shortlist.\n\nHer novel, which runs to a whopping 998 pages, is a stream-of-consciousness monologue that is largely made up of one continuous sentence.\n\nIts narrator is an Ohio housewife who reflects on her past, her family and her country while latticing cherry pies.\n\nJudge Joanna MacGregor describes the book as \"a genre-defying novel, a torrent on modern life [and] a hymn to loss and grief\".\n\nEllmann's inclusion on the shortlist comes five years on from the controversial decision to make US authors eligible.\n\nPaul Beatty become the first US recipient of the prize in 2016 with his racial satire The Sellout.\n\nIf Ducks, Newburyport also goes on to win, it will be the longest winning novel since 2013 winner The Luminaries.\n\nBookmaker Ladbrokes has made it 2/1 favourite to win this year's prize.\n\nBernardine Evaristo - Girl, Woman, Other\n\nImage copyright Jennie Scott/Hamish Hamilton\n\nBorn in London in 1959, Anglo-Nigerian author Evaristo has made the Booker Prize shortlist for the first time with her eighth book.\n\nDescribed as a \"fusion fiction\" novel, Girl, Woman, Other follows the lives of 12 characters, most of whom are black, British and female.\n\nJudge Xiaolu Guo called it \"an impressive, fierce novel... about modern Britain and womanhood\" that \"deserves to be read aloud\".\n\nEvaristo herself has said she aims to \"explore the hidden narratives of the African diaspora\" and \"subvert expectations and assumptions\".\n\nChigozie Obioma - An Orchestra of Minorities\n\nImage copyright Jason Keith/Little Brown\n\nBorn in Nigeria in 1986 and now based in the US, Chigozie Obioma is the author of two novels that have both been shortlisted for the Booker Prize.\n\nHis debut novel The Fishermen previously made the cut in 2015. It went on to inspire a 2018 stage adaptation that transfers to London's West End this week.\n\nAn Orchestra of Minorities tells the story of a young Nigerian chicken farmer whose love for a woman drives him to become an African migrant in Europe.\n\nTold in the mythic style of the Igbo literary tradition, it is described by judge Afua Hirsch as \"a book that wrenches the heart\".\n\nSalman Rushdie - Quichotte\n\nImage copyright Beowulf Sheehan/Jonathan Cape\n\nSir Salman is no stranger to the Booker Prize. He won the award in 1981 with Midnight's Children and made the shortlist again in 1983, 1988 and 1995.\n\nMidnight's Children went on to be judged the \"Booker of Bookers\" in 1993 and \"Best of the Booker\" in 2008.\n\nInspired by Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote, Quichotte tells of an ageing travelling salesman who drives across America to prove himself worthy of a TV star's hand.\n\nPublished last month, the novel - Rushdie's 12th - \"pushes the boundaries of fiction and satire\", according to jury chair Florence.\n\nBorn in India in 1947 and now based in New York, Rushdie is best known for his 1988 novel The Satanic Verses, which sparked widespread protests by Muslims and a fatwa from Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini.\n\nElif Shafak - 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World\n\nImage copyright Oliver Hess/Viking\n\nBritish-Turkish novelist Shafak was born in France in 1971 and has published 17 books, 11 of which are novels.\n\nSet in Istanbul, 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World is made up of the recollections of a sex worker who has been left for dead in a rubbish bin.\n\nJudge Liz Calder - a publisher and editor whose former colleagues include Sir Salman Rushdie - called the book \"a work of fearless imagination\".\n\nOrganisers have insisted the Booker Prize is free from nepotism and favouritism after concerns were raised over Calder's judging role.\n\nImage copyright Booker Prize\n\n'A wide-ranging and ambitious line-up'\n\nby Rebecca Jones, BBC arts correspondent\n\nAfter years of mounting criticism that the Booker Prize had become too worthy and dominated by American novelists, this shortlist is a welcome riposte.\n\nFirst there are two literary heavyweights with Margaret Atwood and Salman Rushdie. Both enjoy critical and commercial success and have won the prize before.\n\nThere is only one American, Lucy Ellmann, who moved to England as a teenager and now lives in Scotland. Yet it is worth noting that a number of the books this year deal with the state of America.\n\nAfter four years when the shortlist featured no writers from Africa, the Nigerian author Chigozie Obioma makes the cut for the second time.\n\nElif Shafak, who was born in Turkey, is shortlisted for a novel written in what is her second language.\n\nBernardine Evaristo completes a wide-ranging and ambitious line-up with a novel told in free verse. Don't be put off - it's glorious.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
