Try to do this at the beginning of a new school year, the first of the month, or the beginning of a new season. Keep the discussion light and low-pressure. This process isn\u2019t about getting better grades, it\u2019s about supporting learning as a family.\n\nEveryone (yes, that means parents, too) sets three short-term, achievable goals oriented around tasks and improvements under your control. For example, \u201cI\u2019m going to get all A's this semester\u201d is too broad and too difficult to control. Instead, try \u201cI\u2019m going to ask for help in math more often,\u201d \u201cI will plan one extra help session a week,\u201d or \u201cI will practice my multiplication three extra times this month.\u201d\n\nOne of those three goals should be a challenge. We can\u2019t hope to convince our children to be emotionally and intellectually brave unless they see us do the same, so set some goals that get you out of your comfort zone. Take guitar or dance or Spanish lessons, try an activity you have never tried before, or pick up a new hobby. This is, after all, how we expand our cognitive potential and make new connections in our brains that can help us become stronger, smarter and more efficient learners.\n\nA few years ago, one of my sons\u2019 goals was to make a few new friends, a goal that was both challenging and important to him.\n\nBefore you set new goals, take the time to assess how everyone did on past goals. Review these goals once a month or once a semester. If you fail to achieve your goals talk about why, and what you plan to do differently next time. If you succeed, celebrate that achievement!\n\nModel: Watching a parent set a scary, ambitious goal and talk about the process of achieving it is the most direct way to teach children that learning and striving to be better are human goals, not just school goals.", "description": "School doesn\u2019t have to be high-stress and high-stakes for your child (or yourself).
