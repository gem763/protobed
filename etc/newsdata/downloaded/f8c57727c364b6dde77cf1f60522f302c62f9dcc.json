Yet this Climate Doomist trope flourishes \u2014 penned, best I can tell, exclusively by older, comfy white men.\"\n\nThe scientific consensus is that reducing emissions can still slow climate change. An October 2018 report by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial average temperatures could reduce the frequency of the most dangerous climate events, such as severe drought and extreme heat.\n\nFranzen disagrees with the notion.\n\n\"If you're younger than sixty, you have a good chance of witnessing the radical destabilization of life on earth\u2014massive crop failures, apocalyptic fires, imploding economies, epic flooding, hundreds of millions of refugees fleeing regions made uninhabitable by extreme heat or permanent drought,\" Franzen wrote in The New Yorker. \"If you're under thirty, you're all but guaranteed to witness it.\"\n\nUC Santa Barbara assistant professor Leah Stokes, NYU professor and climate economist Gernot Wagner, Project Drawdown director and environmental scientist Jonathan Foley, and author Alex Steffen were among those who criticized Franzen's opinion.\n\nBoth Franzen and The New Yorker did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.", "description": "\"It's hard to imagine major outlets publishing essays declaring efforts to reduce poverty hopeless,\" Climate Central editor John Upton said.", "authors": ["Taylor Nicole Rogers"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d757dc52e22af565c480014-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
