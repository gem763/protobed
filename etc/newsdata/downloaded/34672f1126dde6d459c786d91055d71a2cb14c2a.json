We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\u201d\n\n'Sharpiegate': Trump insists Dorian was forecast to 'hit or graze' Alabama Read more\n\nBut the president has been adamant throughout the week that he was correct, and the White House has deployed government resources and staff to back him.\n\nThe latest defense came out Friday evening, when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a statement from an unidentified spokesman stating that information provided by Noaa and the National Hurricane Center to the president had demonstrated that \u201ctropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama\u201d. The advisories were dated from last Wednesday, 28 August, through Monday, the statement read.\n\nThe statement also said the Birmingham NWS tweet Sunday morning \u201cspoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time\u201d.\n\nThe statement from Noaa contrasts with comments the agency\u2019s spokesman, Chris Vaccaro, made last Sunday. \u201cThe current forecast path of Dorian does not include Alabama,\u201d Vaccaro said at the time.\n\nFriday\u2019s Noaa statement, released just before 5pm, points to a few graphics issued by the National Hurricane Center to support Trump\u2019s claims. The maps show percentage possibility of tropical storm force winds in the United States. Parts of Alabama were covered, usually with 5% to 10% chances, between 27 August and 3 September. Maps on 30 August grew to cover far more of Alabama, but for only 12 hours, and the highest percentage hit 20% to 30% before quickly shrinking back down.\n\nAlabama was not mentioned in any of the 75 forecast advisories the hurricane center sent out between 27 August and 2 September.\n\nFrom 28 August to 31 August, a handful of locations in Alabama were mentioned in charts that listed percentage chance of tropical storm force winds or hurricane winds, maxing out at about an 11% chance that Montgomery would get tropical storm force winds.\n\n\u2018So disappointing\u2019\n\nThe former National Hurricane Center director Bill Read blasted Noaa leadership Friday night on his Facebook page calling the situation \u201cso disappointing\u201d and saying he would comment because Noaa employees were ordered to be quiet.\n\n\u201cEither NOAA Leadership truly agrees with what they posted or they were ordered to do it. If it is the former, the statement shows a lack of understanding of how to use probabilistic forecasts in conjunction with other forecast information. Embarrassing. If it is the latter, the statement shows a lack of courage on their part by not supporting the people in the field who are actually doing the work. Heartbreaking,\u201d Read wrote.\n\nDan Sobien, president of the union representing weather service employees, tweeted on Friday: \u201cLet me assure you the hard working employees of the NWS had nothing to do with the utterly disgusting and disingenuous tweet sent out by NOAA management tonight.\u201d\n\nIn a phone interview with the Guardian, he explained his deep concern over Noaa\u2019s statement, which he said was unprecedented in his decades with the NWS. (Sobien stressed that he was speaking in his capacity as president of the union and not for the NWS, which is overseen by Noaa.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unheard of that [Noaa] would \u2013 with no scientific basis whatsoever \u2013 undermine their own employees for political reasons. That\u2019s never happened before under any administration ... This doesn\u2019t happen. This is a scientific agency. People gather data and they make the best decisions they can make form that data.\u201d\n\nSobien\u2019s union represents about 4,000 employees of the NWS, including meteorologists, flight engineers, technicians, and others.\n\n\u201cThe NWS\u2019s job is to save people\u2019s lives, and if you undermine that authority, you\u2019re going to cost people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t believe hurricane warnings or tornado warnings, it will cost lives. That\u2019s what Noaa\u2019s doing. It\u2019s irresponsible, managerial malpractice, and frankly someone should look into them. They have no right to be running an organization if that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nHe said NWS employees were expressing displeasure on social media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen from our own members that they\u2019re up in arms. People are asking us to do something and I don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s just disgusting. The whole thing is just ridiculous.\u201d\n\nOther meteorologists also voiced concerns about NOAA\u2019s actions on Friday.\n\n\u201cI am very disappointed to see this statement come out from Noaa,\u201d the Oklahoma University meteorology professor Jason Furtado told the Associated Press. \u201cI am thankful for the folks at NWS Birmingham for their work in keeping the citizens of Alabama informed and up to date on weather hazards.\u201d\n\nJulia Carrie Wong contributed reporting", "description": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration changes its stance on president\u2019s description of hurricane\u2019s path", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5874d7e5e8ea6a2481590fa3a185f73821dc0da8/0_817_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=56886e9fb88c26f84b79010f4b1fc0d3", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
