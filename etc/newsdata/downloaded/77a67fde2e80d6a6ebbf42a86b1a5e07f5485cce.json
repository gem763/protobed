The hedge fund exited the stake last year.\n\nThe company said it expects to save between $500 million and $550 million in 2021 and record restructuring charges of between $150 million and $200 million by the end of next year.\n\nThe New Jersey-based company said revenue from its financial services segment rose 1.9% to $1.49 billion while that from healthcare services dropped 1.2% to $1.18 billion. The two segments make up more than half of the company's total revenue.\n\nCognizant has warned of lower spending by its banking sector clients in the second half of the year.\n\nThe company said it now expects full-year revenue growth of between 4.6% and 4.9%, compared with its earlier guidance of a growth of between 3.9% and 4.9%.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned $1.08 per share, above estimates of $1.05 per share.\n\n(Reporting by Neha Malara in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Sriraj Kalluvila)", "description": "By Neha MalaraOct 30 (Reuters) - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp  , one of Facebook Inc's content review  contractors, said on Wednesday it would shut...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
