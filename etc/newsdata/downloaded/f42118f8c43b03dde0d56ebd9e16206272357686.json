That's the stock's worst one-day percentage drop since the depths of the recession in 2008.\n\nFedEx is hurt by a slowdown in international air shipping and higher costs in its ground-delivery business.\n\nThe company said late Tuesday that profit fell 11% to $745 million in its fiscal first quarter, missing Wall Street expectations. It predicted full-year adjusted earnings of $11 to $13 per share, well below analysts' $14.68 prediction.\n\nUBS analyst Thomas Wadewitz says pressure on FedEx profit margins is likely to increase and there's no relief in sight for high capital spending.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1pf8nyurB5K.iZdqttUs6w--~B/aD0zODQwO3c9NTc2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/d1c5d21da9b59e91b8fd5d1443260d95", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
