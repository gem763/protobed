Still, given his age it\u2019s reasonable to think he wants to tell as many stories as possible before he leaves this mortal coil.\n\nAnd then what?\n\nEastwood is irreplaceable on a number of fronts. He\u2019s one of the most successful actors to transition to directing, earning two Oscars for his behind-the-camera efforts (\u201cMillion Dollar Baby,\u201d \u201cUnforgiven.\u201d).\n\nHe hails from an era where movie stars mattered. His list of legendary performances starts with \u201cDirty\u201d Harry Callahan and the Man with No Name but stretches to include Bill Munny (\u201cUnforgiven\u201d) and the title character in \u201cThe Outlaw Josey Wales.\u201d Even Philo Beddoe (\u201cEvery Which Way But Loose\u201d) conjures warm, lasting memories.\n\nHe remains a box office draw well into his 80s, something many of his younger peers can only hope to repeat. Last year\u2019s surprise hit \u201cThe Mule,\u201d which cast Eastwood as an accidental drug trafficker, earned $103 million at the U.S. box office.\n\nWill Smith, recently considered a bankable Hollywood star, is currently flopping with his latest film, \u201cGemini Man.\u201d\n\nWhile other iconic directors have slowed down in their golden years, think Francis Ford Coppola and Brian De Palma, Eastwood never takes a beat. For every clunker (think the well-intentioned flop \u201cThe 15:17 to Paris\u201d or \u201cJersey Boys\u201d) he uncorks a stunner like 2016\u2019s \u201cSully.\u201d That Tom Hanks vehicle earned Eastwood near-universal acclaim.\n\nEastwood matters for another, less obvious reason. The legend understands American movie goers in a way few can emulate.\n\nHis Dirty Harry series started during the 1970s, a time when many Americans feared the crime wave cresting over their communities. Critics dubbed Harry Callahan reactionary, and worse, but audiences bonded with his hardcore methods.\n\nYears later, Hollywood served up a steady diet of anti-war movies in the 2000s, from \u201cRedacted\u201d to \u201cIn the Valley of Elah.\u201d\n\nEastwood returned fire with the pro-soldier biopic \u201cAmerican Sniper.\u201d The 2014 film earned an astonishing $350 million, numbers typically associated with superhero romps.\n\nHe irritated some with his 2008 hit \u201cGran Torino,\u201d a film that could serve as a metaphor for his beloved home country. His character, a Korean War veteran named Walt Kowalski, spouted racist rhetoric and viewed his Hmong neighbors with suspicion.\n\nWhen a local gang targeted that community, Walt rallied to their side. He made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure their safety, in particular protecting young Thao (Bee Vang) from a fresh legacy of violence.\n\nThe film, for what it\u2019s worth, made history for casting several Hmong actors in prominent roles.\n\nNow, with \u201cRichard Jewell,\u201d Eastwood isn\u2019t just tapping into the American zeitgeist. He\u2019s marinating in it.\n\nAnd his timing couldn\u2019t be better.\n\nMany distrust not just the mainstream media but the country\u2019s intelligence services, and for good reason.\n\nEnter \u201cRichard Jewell.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming film tracks the heroic security guard accused by the both the press and the FBI of planting a bomb during the 1996 Summer Olympics. In reality his quick instincts likely saved lives. The explosion killed one person and hurt dozens. That toll could have been worse had Jewell not hustled many out of the area after he discovered the bomb.\n\nRELATED: This Forgotten Eastwood Film Deserves Your Attention\n\nThe real Jewell, who died at the age of 44 in 2007, sued CNN, the New York Post and NBC for its biased coverage. The Eastwood movie\u2019s trailer, in turn, all but shouts \u201cFake News.\u201d The film, based on the Vanity Fair article \u201cThe Ballad of Richard Jewell,\u201d stars Paul Walter Hauser as the title character.\n\nWould any other American filmmaker tackle this subject, zeroing in on the media along the way? Studios are far more eager to cheer the press on screen despite the public\u2019s crumbling trust in the institution.\n\nConsider recent, high-profile projects like \u201cSpotlight,\u201d \u201cThe Post\u201d and \u201cKill the Messenger.\u201d\n\nAny project casting a critical eye on reporters today could be viewed as pro-President Donald Trump. That makes Eastwood\u2019s \u201cRichard Jewell\u201d a tiny miracle unto itself.\n\nWould any other filmmaker take that risk? One writer/director comes to mind.\n\nLike Eastwood, Taylor Sheridan transitioned away from acting with impressive results. His 2015 screenplay for \u201cSicario\u201d captured the chaos along the U.S./Mexico border. His follow-up project, 2016\u2019s \u201cHell and High Water,\u201d followed bank robbers whose crimes reflected their town\u2019s economic tumult.\n\nSheridan digs deep into his subjects, evoking elements of American society too often ignored. His 2017 directorial effort, \u201cWind River,\u201d showed tremendous respect not only for law enforcement but the indigenous people at the heart of the tale.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see Sheridan penning a story about a Jewell-like figure. The talented screenwriter still lacks Eastwood\u2019s ability to rally the masses. \u201cSicario\u201d earned $46 million while \u201cHell or High Water\u201d netted a respectable $27 million.\n\nEach is a far cry from your average Eastwood smash.\n\nBeyond Sheridan, though, few names jump out. \u201cSully\u2019s\u201d own Tom Hanks bears mentioning, even if his directorial efforts have focused on one-hit wonders and middle-age romances.\n\nHanks\u2019 contributions to \u201cBand of Brothers,\u201d his superlative work in \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d and the recent \u201cSully\u201d show his appreciation for all-American values. Still, he\u2019s mostly an actor for hire, one eager to work within the establishment via projects like \u201cThe Post\u201d and \u201cCharlie Wilson\u2019s War.\u201d\n\nOne intriguing voice belongs to S. Craig Zahler. The writer/director of \u201cBone Tomahawk,\u201d \u201cBrawl in Cell Block 99\u201d and \u201cDragged Across Concrete\u201d offers an uncompromising look at the American landscape. \u201cBrawl,\u201d for example, captured a blue-collar anti-hero in ways both forceful and forgiving.\n\n\u201cConcrete\u201d allowed bigoted souls to retain their humanity, something lesser scribes might have diminished.\n\nZahler\u2019s work isn\u2019t for the faith of heart, though. Eastwood\u2019s films, even those with \u201cR\u201d ratings, are designed for a wide swath of the country. Zahler may eventually soften his approach. Until then, his dynamic work will be best appreciated by a small but passionate throng.\n\nThat\u2019s not Eastwood\u2019s style. He makes movies for the Everyman, regardless of the industry\u2019s progressive winds. He\u2019s an American original, a star whose connection with the movie going public endures.\n\nThere\u2019s no one in Hollywood who comes close to his ever-expanding legacy.", "description": "Clint Eastwood's new film, Richard Jewell, shows he understands Middle America better than any other filmmaker alive.
