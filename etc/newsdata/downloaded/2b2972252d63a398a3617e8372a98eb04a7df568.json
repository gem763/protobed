Both Trump and Zelensky, however, have denied the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d characterization of their conversation.\n\nZaid and Bakaj wrote in a statement issued Wednesday:\n\nIn light of the ongoing efforts to mischaracterize whistleblower # 1\u2019s alleged \u201cbias\u201d in order to detract from the substance of the complaint, we will attempt to clarify some facts. First, our client has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party. Second, our client has spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the Executive Branch. Third, in these positions, our client has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials \u2013 not as candidates. Fourth, the whistleblower voluntarily provided relevant career information to the ICIG in order to facilitate an assessment of the credibility of the complaint.\n\nThe lawyers went on to deem the original \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d complaint \u201curgent and credible.\u201d\n\nNews reports have identified the original \u201cwhistleblower\u201d as a \u201cregistered Democrat.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times (NYT) revealed the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d shared his complaint with a Democrat-led House panel before reaching out to the IC inspector general, a move that suggests he violated the law.\n\n\u201cThe whistleblower is not the story. To date, virtually every substantive allegation has been confirmed by other sources,\u201d the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers said in the statement. \u201cFor that reason the identity of the whistleblower is irrelevant.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats are reportedly considering having the original whistleblower testify remotely with the face and voice obscured to keep the identity hidden from Republican lawmakers and staffers.\n\nSo far, House Democrats have carried out the impeachment investigation behind closed doors.\n\nThe lawyers representing the \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d have maintained relationships with Democrats and expressed ardently anti-Trump sentiment.\n\nTheir law firm \u2014 Compass Rose Legal Group \u2014 was so desperate to find Trump administration informants that they previously offered discounted pricing to those who come forward.\n\nZaid co-founded Whistleblower Aid, a small nonprofit that blasted advertisements around the nation\u2019s capital actively seeking leakers during the Trump administration.\n\nOne of the lawyers representing the \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d \u2014 Charles McCullough \u2014 is a former staffer for Democrat Sens. Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton.\n\nHe also served as the intelligence community IG at the height of the Clinton email scandal.
