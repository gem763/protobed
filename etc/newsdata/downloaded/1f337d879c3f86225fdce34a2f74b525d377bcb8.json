It was a clearly sarcastic post from 2016 about Paul Ryan crushing alt-right challenger Paul Nehlen. If the over the top language isn\u2019t a tip off, it\u2019s a fairly dead giveaway that Olson refers to Ryan having \u201csuffered a massive, historic, emasculating 70-point victory.\u201d\n\nWhen one of the commenters suggests Ryan must be neo-con and a Jew, Olson, clearly joking, responded, \u201cIt must be true because I\u2019ve never heard the Lamestream Media report it, and you know they protect their own.\u201d\n\nAnd yet Bloomberg used this to tear him down. Ted Frank, a lawyer and friend of Olson (who happens to be Jewish), has a Twitter thread on this disgrace. Frank also notes that \u201ca good man who just moved his family from Texas to engage in public service has his life disrupted.\u201d Even liberal Jonathan Chait, no fan of the Trump administration, acknowledged this was \u201cterribly unfair.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Philip Klein", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Shameful-Trump-Labor-Appointee-Forced-To-Resign-After-Bloomberg-Portrays-Sarcastic-Facebook-Post-As-Anti-Semitic"], "top_image": ""}
