The operation has already displaced some 100,000 people, according to the United Nations.\n\nEU foreign ministers also agreed to draw up a sanctions framework targeting individuals and legal entities in response to Turkey's oil and gas drilling in the Eastern Mediterranean. The decision enables the EU to put together a list of sanctions ready to be issued if and when member states decide to do so.", "description": "The bloc\u2019s foreign ministers also decided to draw up potential sanctions over Ankara\u2019s drilling activities off Cyprus.", "authors": ["Zia Weise", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175871362-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
