Halloween was celebrated at the White House on Monday. President Trump and First Lady Melania passed out candy to the children of members of the military and local school children.\n\nThe best part of this White House tradition is that it is one time that escapes negative political coverage of the president \u2013 at least as of Tuesday morning as I write this. The kids come to the White House and they are handed candy by the president and first lady. Easy peasy. The adults fawn over the kids, just like in neighborhoods around the country, and their parents are left to deal with sugar rushes at bedtime.\n\nPresident Trump stood and handed out candy after a long day on the road, proving his ability to keep fully scheduled days as a person much younger would be able to do. He\u2019s no Sleepy Joe. He traveled to Chicago Monday morning, attended a fundraiser, and delivered a speech at a conference for leaders in law enforcement before arriving back at the White House. Hundreds of kids attended. That\u2019s a full day, especially for a seventy-something-year-old man.\n\nThe children dressed up as astronauts, military officers, pirates and dinosaurs as they greeted the president and first lady one-by-one Monday. The Air Force Strolling Strings played \u201cThriller\u201d from Michael Jackson, \u201cThe Addams Family\u201d theme song and other spooky tunes to set the mood. A Halloween display of Black Forest trees wrapped around the columns of the South Portico, while pumpkins lined the staircases.\n\nMelania Trump has a flair for decorating and this year\u2019s White House decorations rise to the occasion.\n\nThis year\u2019s White House Halloween decorations \ud83c\udf83 pic.twitter.com/ZLTrtmwDHL \u2014 Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) October 29, 2019\n\nThough Halloween became popular in the early twentieth century, it wasn\u2019t until the Eisenhower administration that it was celebrated in the White House. Mamie Eisenhower, like Melania Trump, liked to decorate for holidays. President Kennedy\u2019s young children brought about a photo of kids in Halloween costumes in the Oval Office. Pat Nixon hosted Halloween parties in the White House and Amy Carter celebrated her tenth birthday with a Halloween-themed party. It\u2019s all good bipartisan fun.\n\nThis year the Secret Service showed off \u201cThe Beast\u201d, the presidential limo, and NASA displayed a spacesuit worn by astronauts for spacewalks. The Department of the Interior gave out Junior Ranger Explorer badges, stickers, and books. What\u2019s not to like?\n\nMy question is this \u2013 what happens to the candy once it goes into the child\u2019s candy bag? Do the adults take the candy bar and save it as a sort of historic souvenir or does the child just dig in like any other treat? I think this a once-in-a-lifetime experience for a child and I\u2019d hold on to the memento. If not the whole candy bar, at least I\u2019d save the wrapper and frame it or something. I noticed Trump handing out full-sized candy bars, by the way, not the fun-sized stuff I hand out. Your mileage may vary.\n\nI\u2019m here for the smiles.\n\nHALLOWEEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE: President Trump and the First Lady handed out candy to trick-or-treaters at the White House on Monday. pic.twitter.com/KZ5tn5zSgR \u2014 Local News 8 (@localnews8) October 29, 2019\n\nFrom all indications, a good time was had by all. So, this is your piece of fluff in the news today. You\u2019re welcome.
