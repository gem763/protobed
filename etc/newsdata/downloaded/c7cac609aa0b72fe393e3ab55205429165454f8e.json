He thinks he has got the body of a 23-year-old.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judge came under criticism this week for siding with head judge Shirley Ballas and controversially voting to send home Catherine Tyldesley over Mike Bushell.\n\nBut despite Shirley receiving death threats over her decisions on the show, Craig believes that, while social media has made all fans into critics, \u2018everyone is entitled to their own opinion.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018When we first started 16 years ago, there was no social media. Everyone now has an iPhone and they are tweeting and everyone has an account.\u2019\n\nSpeaking about the decision to send Catherine and Johannes home over favourites to leave Mike and Katya, Craig said: \u2018For us the judges, we have to judge the dance off only, not what happened previously or what is to become and you can only judge what you see in that one minute thirty and in my opinion Mike had the cleaner dance.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s quite simple and you know if it was another day or if Catherine was doing a rumba for instance, against his tango, then she would have won it. But you know it\u2019s what happens on the day.\u2019\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues Saturday at 7pm with the results show on Sunday at 7.15pm on BBC One.\n\nMORE: Will Bayley forced to quit Strictly Come Dancing after horrific leg injury\n\nMORE: Hollyoaks spoilers: Darren Osbourne cheats on Mandy Richardson with Nancy", "description": "Craig Revel Horwood has begged his fellow Strictly Come Dancing judge to stop posting shirtless selfies.", "authors": ["Isobel Lewis"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_94012259_1572462917.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
