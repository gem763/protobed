Half the students had been prepped with some neutral chit-chat beforehand, while the others were riled up with comments like \u201chey dummy \u2013you\u2019re going to lose, and you\u2019re going to lose bad\u2026. end of story!!!!!!\u201d They were all informed that if they won, they\u2019d win the coveted prize of $1.\n\nIncredibly, those who had been the targets of trash-talking performed significantly better than those who hadn\u2019t. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting because though we tend to think of it as being a way of intimidating another person, and diminishing their performance, what we\u2019re finding is that when you\u2019re the recipient of trash talk, you become extra motivated to outperform your opponent,\u201d says Yip.\n\nAs Yip points out in his study, the workplace is a hotbed of competition, because this is the natural consequence when there aren\u2019t enough resources to go around. In the world of work, these \u201cresources\u201d consist of bonuses, promotions and places on the most exciting projects.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bbc.Com Worklife Article"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
