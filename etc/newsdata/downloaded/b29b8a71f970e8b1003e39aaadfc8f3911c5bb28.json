The narrowbody aircraft was formerly known as the Bombardier CSeries. French air crash investigators classified the problem that disrupted the Swiss flight shortly after departure from London Heathrow on Tuesday as a \"serious incident\" and said it would be investigated by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.\n\nKorean Air says conducting urgent inspections of Airbus A220 engines", "description": "Korean Air says conducting urgent inspections of Airbus A220 engines", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEBA20RB_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
