Excuse my language! I was worried. I knew how bad that would be for the team. I've been in that situation before and it's not a nice feeling.\n\n'I never go into a game intending to do anything that would get me a card or put the team at any risk. I had only been on for 90 seconds and I was thinking to myself, \"If he gives me a red card this is the end of me\".'\n\nMoriarty went on to score the winning try in the 20-19 victory over Les Bleus, touching down after Justin Tipuric was held up short.\n\nHaving escaped a red card Moriarty is likely to start against the physical Boks with Navidi out. 'This is a game I look forward to,' said Moriarty, who follows in the footsteps of dad Paul and uncle Richard who played in the 1987 World Cup semi-final.\n\nIt was Moriarty who went over late in the game to seal Wales' place in the semi-finals\n\n'I know what their forwards thrive on, which is being physical, and that's what I thrive on as well. I think I get better in those situations.'\n\nReplacement back Owen Lane joined up with the squad yesterday having come in for the hamstrung Navidi.\n\nThe WRU have offered condolences to forwards coach Robin McBryde whose mother, Diana, died last week. Warren Gatland said: 'Robin is a proud family man and we as a squad are here to support him and his family.'\n\nMcBryde will stay in Japan and he said: 'My mother was my biggest fan and as with any parent, she would want the best for me, so I know I am where she would want me to be.'", "description": "Wales back-rower Ross Moriarty is relishing a chance to smash into the Springboks, but was worried it could be curtains for him after he hit France centre Gael Fickou high on Sunday.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/22/20056402-0-image-a-7_1571779430198.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
