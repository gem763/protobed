If I receive any further complaints I will have to investigate further.\n\n\"If you have any enquires please do not hesitate to contact me.\"\n\nBellla, 24, said: \"As I opened it, I thought it was strange that Arianna had a letter but I thought maybe it was from the GP,\" she told BirminghamLive.\n\n\"But then I had to laugh as I read it, suggested my child is responsible for anti-social behaviour.\"\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\nBella said council staff had even visited her home twice to investigate the noise complaints, but both times she was out on the school run.\n\n\"When she walks she is heavy footed, the way she walks she kind of stamps,\" she said.\n\n\"She has eczema on her arms and the back of her legs so sometimes she wakes up and starts crying and she'll be scratching. She'll make noise because it's itching her.\"\n\nBella said there were previously complaints over her daughter's cying as a newborn baby. She said the claims stopped for a while the letter arrived on Thursday, October 17.\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\nAnd she accepted there had been other noise issues. She said police called at her home the morning after she threw a gender reveal party in February for her younger daughter. But Bella said she had been wrongly blamed in other complaints about reggae music being played.\n\nA statement from Birmingham City Council read: \u201cThis was an error and the letter should have been addressed to the tenant of the property.\n\n\"The complaint does not relate to the child in any way.\n\n\"As the notification letter explains, it is guests to the home who are allegedly causing loud banging and shouting, often late at night.\n\n\"An officer has visited the property to explain this to the tenant.\u201d", "description": "Reception class pupil Ariana Edwards was warned she would be subject to \"further investigation\" by the council if another noise complaint was made", "authors": ["Stephanie Balloo", "Image", "Bpm Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20730044.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Ariana-Edwards.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
