It was perhaps their most tactically astute performance of the season to date, in some aspects more convincing than the opening weekend\u2019s 4-0 win over Chelsea, and maybe even their best day at the office since the victory at Paris Saint-Germain back in March.\n\nSolskjaer\u2019s switch to a 3-4-1-2 formation worked, neutralising Liverpool\u2019s full-backs and maximising the pace for Daniel James and Marcus Rashford. If it is maintained, it would suit a squad which is top heavy in defence and somewhat light in attack. \u201cIt can develop into something,\u201d Solskjaer said after the final whistle on Sunday. \u201cWe have players to play three at the back and it allows more width.\u201d\n\nThe United manager has maintained for some time that results would eventually turn, insisting that the underlying performances have been good. \u201cWe felt we haven't got the results we deserved but we need to win games,\u201d he said, albeit while making sure not to seem too pleased with a draw at home. \u201cOne point is a start but we\u2019re still disappointed. We\u2019re not excited by one point.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

United arrive in Serbia for a Europa League meeting with Partizan Belgrade having not won on the road since that night in Paris. This is the first of four consecutive games away from home, with Norwich City, Chelsea in the EFL Cup and Bournemouth to follow. Even after Sunday\u2019s showing, you would be reluctant to put a significant amount of money on them winning any one of those four.\n\n\u201cIt's a question we've asked ourselves as well,\u201d Solskjaer said on Wednesday, when his side\u2019s dreadful away form was put to him. \u201cAfter I came in we won nine on the bounce and since then we haven't won any.\u201d Only last month, he was bristling at the idea that his lack of away wins was a concern. He is a little more honest with himself now. \u201cIt's an issue we have to deal with and sort out as soon as possible,\u201d the United manager admitted.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We\u2019ve got four tough away games but we're starting tomorrow and hopefully we can kick-start that with a win tomorrow.\u201d\n\nBut though the spirit is willing, the flesh is weak. The problem - clear to most who watch this team regularly - is tactical. United are comfortable playing without the ball, sitting deep, remaining disciplined and then countering at speed. Solskjaer is happy to trade possession for gaining space in behind. And while that approach may appear to suit your typical away side, United are no typical opponent. On the majority of occasions, they are expected to provide the game\u2019s attacking impetus. This is Manchester United, after all.\n\nBelgrade on Thursday night is likely to be one such occasion. Savo Milosevic\u2019s Partizan currently only sit fifth in the Serbian Superliga yet have conceded just seven goals in their 11 games this season. It is expected that they will attempt to play United at their own game: sit off, allow Solskjaer\u2019s side to come at them then attempt to pick them off on the break. There are few teams in Europe\u2019s second-tier club competition who would do things differently if a club of United\u2019s stature come calling.\n\nSolskjaer needs to discover a way to comfortably beat these types of teams if he is to win the tournament and achieve Champions League qualification by means other than a top-four finish. There are simply too many teams in the Europa League who - either over-awed or under-resourced - would set up to frustrate United like West Ham, Rochdale, AZ Alkmaar and Newcastle have over the past month. It is now six games since United\u2019s last win - that limp, narrow victory at home over Kazakhstani champions Astana.\n\nDespite it being a qualified success, the new formation is not expected to survive. It was a specific game plan to combat Liverpool\u2019s strengths and Solskjaer\u2019s usual 4-2-3-1 is likely to be reinstated. There will therefore not be the same space to break into and attack. This time, United\u2019s opponents will simply not allow it. Sunday\u2019s result was a flicker of hope that Solskjaer\u2019s methods can work if all things fall neatly into place, but Thursday and the away trips which follow are more likely to be a stark reminder of where United are at.", "description": "Could Sunday\u2019s 1-1 draw with Liverpool be a turning point for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Manchester United?
