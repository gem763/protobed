Get pole position on the first run and then just time everyone out,\u201d said Hamilton, seemingly pointing the finger of blame at Ferrari, whose army of fans were celebrating anyway.\n\nThe pole was Leclerc\u2019s fourth of the season and second in a row. The Monegasque will be chasing his second successive victory on Sunday after winning for the first time in Belgium last weekend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with pole but it\u2019s a shame at the end it was a big mess and I hoped our last lap was enough,\u201d said the youngster.", "description": "Charles Leclerc put Ferrari on pole position for their home Italian Formula One Grand Prix on Saturday in a qualifying session that ended in farce and with drivers under investigation.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427288441&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF860NG", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
