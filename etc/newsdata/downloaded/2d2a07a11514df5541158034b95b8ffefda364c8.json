Pictured: The Hume Dam\n\nHe claimed he had calculated that from August to November last year 800,000 megalitres of water had been wasted 'in one forest.'\n\nCattle farmers Neil Campbell and his daughter Meg also complained about the 'poor management'.\n\nDue to crippling drought, the pair are contemplating shutting their dairy farm at Mayrung in the New South Wales Riverina.\n\n'There is no future for this area if there's no water \u2013 and that's devastating,' Ms Campbell told 60 Minutes.\n\n'We're in a man-made drought. Our water is flowing past us every single day and we can't touch it.'\n\nMr Campbell said the process by which water is allocated to farmers needs to be made fairer.\n\nHe said: 'They haven't allocated the water to help the other farmers that are in desperate need'.\n\nA farm in drought on the outskirts of the north-western New South Wales town of Boggabri, Australia\n\nNearby neighbour Ray Smith said he is battling through a 'man-made drought'.\n\n'I'd like a bit of transparency into where all the water is going. It wouldn't worry me too much if it wasn't man made,' he said.\n\n'But this is man-made. This is policy-driven.\n\n'We realise it's a drought, but we're not going crook about the drought, we're going crook about the waste of water.'\n\nA spokesman for the MDBA directed Daily Mail Australia to its losses report for an explanation of the the overflow issue.\n\nThe report states: 'In the 2018\u201319 year the ability to minimise losses was restricted by the warm, dry conditions, low tributary inflows and high demands. As Lake Victoria\u2019s storage did not start to rise as it typically would, overbank transfers from Hume Dam became a necessity to appropriately manage the risk of a delivery shortfall in the months ahead.\n\n'Undertaking these transfers resulted in in losses which are higher than similar past years. This difference was driven by the combined effect of the consistently high temperatures, below average to very much below average rainfall, and low tributary inflows.\n\n'If transfers of the magnitude undertaken had not been made the risk of a delivery shortfall in summer would have escalated.\n\n'Ensuring Lake Victoria has enough water in it ahead of the peak summer demand period is critical to ensuring all demands can be met. Without these transfers, the main objective of operations \u2013 which is to deliver state water orders, may not have been met.\n\n'The ability for river operators to employ alternative arrangements is limited when delivering against the overarching operating objectives. For example, if transfers at rates above channel capacity were to be avoided this year, they would have had to commence as early as May 2018.\n\n'While this option may have reduced the losses, it would have increased the risk of a spill. For 2018-19, the risk of spill at Lake Victoria during June and July was assessed to be about 90 per cent.\n\n'Commencing transfers earlier would have increased this risk. Based on this relatively high risk of spill, the judgement at the time was to delay commencing transfers.'", "description": "Millions of litres of water was wasted last year\u00a0because officials pumped so much through a narrow river channel that it overflowed - amid the worst drought on record.", "authors": ["Charlie Moore", "Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/13/20244412-0-image-a-20_1572183962551.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
