They are complaining of stress following near daily clashes with violent youths on the fringes of demonstrations protesting at government employment reform laws.\n\nFrench Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has defended the police and said 350 of them had been injured in standoffs that had produced 1,300 arrests in just two months.\n\nFurther strikes and protests are planned for the rest of the week in what labour unions, along with a youth protest movement called Nuit Debout or Night Rising, hope will prove a big enough show of force to make President Hollande reconsider his changes to French labour laws.\n\nLoading\u2026", "description": "A French police patrol car came under attack in Paris on Wednesday (May 18), four people have been arrested.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/333107/1000x563_333107.jpg", "published_at": "2016-05-19"}
