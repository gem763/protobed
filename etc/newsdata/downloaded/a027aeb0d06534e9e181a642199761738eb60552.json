We viewed the body of the true Pan Africanist. #Gushungu #EFFAtBlueRoof pic.twitter.com/tLyfbZzHKU \u2014 Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) September 23, 2019 Report\n\n\"Mr Mugabe was sleeping easy... just resting peacefully. He is resting,\" Mrs Mugabe said, during Mr Malema's visit.\n\nThis was followed by the viewing of the body, and a sumptuous lunch of pie and vegetables across the room from the corpse.\n\nSome Zimbabweans are now drawing comparisons with rituals in Indonesia's Tana Toraja region, where it takes a long time to bury the dead.\n\nThe corpse is kept in the house. The bereaved wash and clean it. They bring it food twice a day, as well as coffee and even cigarettes.\n\nIt is a way for the living to deal with grief. People believe the dead can hear them, and if they do not take care of the dead, the spirit - hovering above their heads - will haunt them.\n\nFear of the dead\n\nTraditional beliefs among the Shona ethnic group - under which the Gushungo clan falls - also requires many rituals to be performed when death occurs.\n\nThese rituals reinforce a collective identity, and help families and communities to come to terms with the loss of a loved one.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Robert Mugabe will continue to cast a shadow over Zimbabwe for many years\n\nZimbabwean experts in this field also say that Shona funeral rituals tend to revolve around fear of the dead.\n\nThe spirit is regarded as being powerful, with human-like emotions. It can also haunt the living, if the corpse is not looked after.\n\nHaving ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980, Mugabe was not just a towering figure - he was a political institution.\n\nNext to his mother\n\nSome Zimbabweans say the 95-year-old spirit may not yet be ready for his interment and this why his body was kept at his mansion for so long.\n\nHis family appears to be at ease with this. Some of them have said one of Mugabe's wishes was that his wife should never leave the corpse until he is buried.\n\nIt is unclear why he would make such a wish. Perhaps the family fears his body could be tampered with for ritual purposes.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mugabe: From war hero to resignation\n\nAccording to the family, Mugabe had another wish - to be buried at his rural home, close to his late mother, Bona. They further accuse President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mugabe's long-time ally, of betraying his former comrade and being behind the military takeover.\n\nNormally the wishes of the dead are respected, but when alive, Mugabe defied the wishes of some of his liberation war colleagues who asked not to be buried at Harare's Heroes Acre, the shrine for freedom fighters.\n\nIt seemed as though Mr Mnangagwa was going to do the same - he announced that a special grave would be built for his predecessor at Heroes Acre.\n\nMore about Robert Mugabe:\n\nIt was to have been a shrine to symbolise - as Mr Mnangagwa put it - his great works.\n\nAfter behind-the-scenes talks, Mugabe's family agreed to the plan.\n\n\"The government and the chiefs went to the Heroes Acre, showed each other where President Mugabe is going to be buried, and that place would take about 30 days to complete,\" said Leo Mugabe, a nephew of the former president who has acted as a spokesman for the family.\n\n'He didn't invent the country'\n\nBut the construction of the mausoleum at the national shrine provoked intense controversy.\n\nHistory professor Gerry Mazarire told me that to elevate Mugabe above other heroes of the Independence War would create a false narrative - that he invented the country. It also belittles the contribution of others - and suggests that the government is being held to ransom by the ego of a dead man, he said.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The Heroes Acre shrine is to remember those who fought colonial rule\n\nMany Zimbabweans could not understand the decision - if you defy the wishes of the dead, you anger their spirit, and it is difficult to then appease it.\n\nThe family must have felt the pressure.\n\nIt seems that this point has now been taken on board - the government has announced that the former president would be buried in Zvimba in accordance with the \"new position\" of his family.\n\nThe question now is whether the man who tried to treat Zimbabwe's presidency as a hereditary post will be buried in a cave, like a traditional chief.", "description": "The controversial Zimbabwean leader is due to be buried, three weeks after his death.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16AB1/production/_108994829_gracertr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
