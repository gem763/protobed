Tulsi Gabbard has spent her longshot presidential bid amassing an odd coalition of lefty contrarians and pro-Trump internet celebrities looking to blow up the establishment.\n\nHillary Clinton gave them the spark they needed to detonate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to acknowledge the damage that you\u2019ve caused,\u201d Gabbard said in a social media video addressed to Clinton on Tuesday night, four repetitive days after she dunked on the former secretary of state as \u201cqueen of the warmongers\u201d in a viral Twitter thread.\n\nThe 2016 Democratic nominee said Trumpland is \u201cgrooming\u201d the Hawaiian Democrat for a third-party run \u2014 not the Kremlin. Media outlets misrepresented the hard-to-parse remarks, and Gabbard ran with it en route to a 2019 Trump card: She owned the biggest lib of them all.\n\nClinton\u2019s actual comments, during a podcast exchange about the Republican Party\u2019s 2020 strategy, have been muddled in the ensuing media hubbub. Her aides have added to the confusion by suggesting she was in fact referring to Gabbard.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re also going to do third party again,\u201d Clinton said of the GOP\u2019s approach to securing an electoral college win. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She\u2019s a favorite of the Russians.\u201d\n\nREAD: The Democrats unfriended and blocked Silicon Valley last night\n\nThe ensuing Democratic Party infighting, drawing in Sen. Bernie Sanders, who came to Gabbard\u2019s defense, has been catnip for cable news. The three major networks mentioned Gabbard 815 times between Friday and Wednesday, according to the media monitoring tool GDELT Project, more than a third of her total for all of 2019.\n\nFox News referred to Gabbard on air 675 times this year up to last Thursday. From her Friday dustup till Wednesday, the channel did so 485 more times, producing endless coverage long after its competitors. Many of its discussions about the Democrat featured videos pulled directly from her social media feeds running on loop.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a worse set of leaders in this country,\u201d primetime host Tucker Carlson said in one of his segments defending Gabbard and attacking Clinton. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising that this group \u2014 the ones who wrecked the country \u2014 don\u2019t take criticism well. Don\u2019t like their program? You must be a spy.\u201d\n\nIt was an explosion of the compliments from Trump supporters, including pro-Trump troll Mike Cernovich, onetime White House aide Steve Bannon, and former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke, that have bubbled beneath Gabbard\u2019s presidential bid.\n\nSince Friday, media outlets and pundits across the pro-Trump internet have continued pumping out content in an apparent attempt to elevate a campaign polling in the low single digits. While Gabbard has met the donor threshold needed to qualify for the next Democratic primary debate in November, she needs three more qualifying polls showing her at 3 percent support nationally or in early nominating states. The past week of attention could help put her over the edge.\n\nREAD: Facebook had to nuke a bunch of Russian bots right as it bragged it's ready for 2020\n\n\u201cPossibly the most epic burn in history,\u201d read a Daily Caller Facebook post describing Gabbard\u2019s initial smackdown of Clinton, one of at least 20 Facebook posts about the exchange published by Wednesday.\n\nOf the 30 top-performing Facebook posts measured by interactions during that span, the analytics tool CrowdTangle says that 15 have come from Breitbart, The Daily Caller, Fox News and its personalities, and own-the-libs pundit Ben Shapiro. Most of the others likewise come from right-wing pages; no mainstream media outlet cracked the list.\n\n\u201cBURN: Tulsi Gabbard slams Hillary for insinuating she's in cahoots with the RUSSIANS\u2026\u201d read a post from CNSNews, a conservative outlet that contributed two top-performing posts.\n\nDisinformation experts have indeed warned that Gabbard\u2019s campaign could be targeted by state-backed propaganda efforts, as she has rubbed shoulders with authoritarians and argued against even a minor U.S. presence in Syria. But Clinton\u2019s comment struck all the right notes to activate the left and right flanks of Gabbards extremely online support in response. Both have painted liberal fixation on Russian influence as a conspiracy theory absolving them of 2016 sins.\n\nGabbard\u2019s campaign has continued driving that conversation with a PR barrage across social and traditional media, including an interview with Carlson, where she did not dispute his characterization that Clinton called her a Russian asset. Gabbard\u2019s campaign did not respond to VICE News\u2019 request for comment on this distinction.\n\nGabbard did share a clip of Carlson on Instagram, one of 11 times she\u2019s laced into corporate media or the Democratic establishment on the platform in the past week. \u201cIf you\u2019re sick of the new McCarthyism and warmongering by Hillary and her cohorts,\u201d the caption read, \u201cthen join our campaign.\u201d\n\nCover: Rep.
