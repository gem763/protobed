The Florida Tomato Exchange in 2018 requested that the Commerce Department terminate a prior agreement that had previously resolved longstanding accusations of dumping tomatoes at unfairly low prices in the U.S.\n\nRetailers are worried the inspections in the new deal will lead to bottlenecks at the border.\n\n\u201cAny delay in inspections would lead to quality degradation and added cost,\u201d wrote James R. Bailey, senior director for federal government affairs at Walmart Inc., in a September letter to the Commerce Department. \u201cGiven the high quality and low failure rate of Mexican tomatoes, such intensive inspections do not seem proportionate to the risk.\u201d\n\nTomato importers said the Florida growers have used their influence with the state\u2019s lawmakers to push for advantages over Mexican competitors. U.S. officials had previously sought to include a provision in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, or USMCA, that would allow seasonal growers to challenge alleged dumping and subsidies coming from Mexico. The provision wasn\u2019t accepted by Mexico. But Florida lawmakers, who may soon vote on USMCA, have supported the latest effort to restructure the tomato trade rules.\n\nMario Robles of the Sinaloa tomato growers association in Mexico said, \u201cWe were able to secure a number of important provisions that will make this deal work for our distributors and customers.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Tomato Exchange welcomed the deal, saying it \u201cincludes strong monitoring, enforcement and anti-circumvention provisions, including border inspections, that should help eliminate the injury to American tomato farmers caused by dumped Mexican tomatoes.\u201d\n\nThe deal was also lauded by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s successful outcome validates the administration\u2019s strong and smart approach to negotiating trade deals,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cThe department\u2019s action brought the Mexican growers to the negotiating table and led to a result that protects U.S. tomato producers from unfair trade.\u201d\n\nWrite to William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com", "description": "Retailers and importers warn a new deal with Mexican tomato growers could lead to more expensive and\u00a0lower-quality tomatoes at the supermarket.", "authors": ["William Mauldin"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109003/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
