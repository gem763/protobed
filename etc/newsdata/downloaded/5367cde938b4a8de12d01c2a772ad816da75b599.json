I love Lauryn Hill. And I am really sorry if I offended you.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut as many noted on social media, Rodriguez, a Chicago native of Puerto Rican descent, might have anticipated the anger. The actress has long faced criticism for appearing to overlook black women as she advocates for women and Latinos in Hollywood. In July 2017, when Marvel began to promote its groundbreaking film \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d Rodriguez tweeted, \u201cMarvel and DC are killing it in inclusion and women but where are the Latinos?! Asking for a friend \u2026\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe question provoked ire not least because \u201cBlack Panther\u201d marked a profound cultural moment for African Americans. And, as many pointed out, both companies have employed Latino actors. Rodriguez\u2019s tweet seemed to ignore that two of Marvel\u2019s highest-grossing movie franchises prominently feature actresses of Afro-Latino descent: Zoe Saldana, who is Dominican and Puerto Rican, stars as Gamora in \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d; Tessa Thompson, whose father is Afro-Panamanian, plays Valkyrie in \u201cThor: Ragnarok.\u201d Both actresses appeared in this year\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d which obliterated box office records.\n\nIn 2018, Rodriguez was blasted for interrupting her \u201cSmallfoot\u201d co-star Yara Shahidi during a press junket when an interviewer asked Shahidi, the star of Freeform\u2019s \u201cGrown-ish,\u201d about being a role model to young black women. \u201cSo many women,\u201d Rodriguez corrected, prompting reproach from fans who thought the question \u2014 about the on-screen representation of a group that has been routinely overlooked and misrepresented \u2014 had been phrased appropriately in its initial form.\n\nAD\n\nRodriguez drew similar criticism later that year when she stated in a roundtable interview with Net-a-Porter that \u201cblack women get paid more than Asian women, Asian women get paid more than Latina women, and it\u2019s, like, a very scary space to step into.\u201d This isn\u2019t the case in Hollywood, the industry the gathered actresses had been discussing; at that point, Sofia Vergara, the Colombian star of \u201cModern Family,\u201d had topped Forbes\u2019s list of the highest-paid actresses for seven consecutive years. Rodriguez\u2019s claim isn\u2019t true in the wider workforce, either, where recent estimates cite narrower wage gaps for white and Asian women.\n\nAD\n\nRodriguez\u2019s latest blunder might be more complicated than the others, however. There is a long-standing debate in hip-hop around whether Latino artists should use the n-word \u2014 a discussion that broadened when Jennifer Lopez uttered the slur in Ja Rule\u2019s remix of her 2001 song \u201cI\u2019m Real.\u201d She defended herself on the \u201cToday\u201d show, saying that the suggestions of her being racist were \u201creally absurd and hateful to me\u201d and clarifying that the lyric had been written by Ja Rule, who told MTV News she wasn\u2019t \u201cthe first Latino to use that word on a record, and it\u2019s never been an issue before.\u201d Fat Joe, a rapper of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent, has long held that Latinos should be allowed to use the n-word and said in a recent interview on Hot 97\u2032s \u201cEbro in the Morning\u201d that \u201cLatinos are black.\u201d\n\nRodriguez hasn\u2019t used this defense, though she described her father as Afro-Latino while addressing the \u201cdevastating\u201d backlash to her Net-a-Porter interview in a January episode of \u201cSway in the Morning.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe black community was the only community that I looked towards growing up. We didn\u2019t have many Latino shows, and the black community made me feel like I was seen,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cSo to get anti-black is saying that I\u2019m anti-family. \u2026 If anything, the black community is my community. As Latinos, we have black Latinos. That is what we are. I am not, so I think that when I speak about Latino advocacy, people believe I only mean people of my skin color.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The actress posted (and then deleted) an Instagram Story video of herself singing along to a Lauryn Hill verse that includes the slur.", "authors": ["Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture", "Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/23MAPGPWkdS0w-kcLe5iKAyZ5fk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VDJWSVHPSAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
