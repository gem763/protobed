When I asked for more dance classes, I heard yes. More voice lessons? Yes. A different wig, a pair of fake teeth not made out of rubber? Yes. And all these things they require effort and cost more money. But my bosses never presumed to know better than I did about what I needed in order to do my job and honor Gwen Verdon.\n\nI want to say thank you so much to FX and fox 21 studios for supporting me completely and paying me equally, because they understood because they understood that when you put value into a person, it empowers that person to get in touch with their own inherent value. And then where do they put that value? They put it into their work. The next time a woman, and especially a woman of color, because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white male counterpart, tells you what she needs in order to do her job, listen to her, believe her, because one day she might stand in front of you and say thank you for allowing her to succeed because of her workplace environment and not in spite of it.\"", "description": "Williams won best lead actress in a limited series for her role on FX's \"Fosse/Verdon\" and has become an advocate for pay disparity.", "authors": ["Kirsten Acuna"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d88370ef4fc2466c74f7868-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
