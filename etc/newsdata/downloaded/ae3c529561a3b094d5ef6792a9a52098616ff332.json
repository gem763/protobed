He didn\u2019t have any food allergies or dietary requirements \u2013 he just couldn\u2019t stomach eating anything that had been cooked.\n\nAs the only person there with a lunchbox, Colston realised he was different.\n\nThe food delivery driver from Dursley, near Gloucester, hasn\u2019t eaten a meal made from scratch for 29 years.\n\nColston has been living on a diet of crisps, toast, tinned spaghetti, and desserts. Cooked meals make him physically sick, thanks to the taste and texture, and he hasn\u2019t been able to consume them since he was two years old.\n\nAs a baby, anything he was fed would be vomited out within minutes. Growing up, he quickly learned to make food for himself that he could keep down, which included tinned goods, cereals and snacks.\n\nColston describes himself as a \u2018sickly baby\u2019 (Picture: Colston Hughes)\n\nHe also developed a need to ensure none of his food was touching, a habit he describes as symptomatic of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt school he\u2019d offer his free school meal to his sister and only eat her pudding. The lack of food meant he was hungry for most of his life.\n\n\u2018I got used to eating one meal a day for four to five years, I was so used to it that I didn\u2019t realise my body had gotten used to being hungry,\u2019 he tells Metro.co.uk.\n\nToday Colston still struggles with his dietary preferences, but is at a healthy weight and tries to be active.\n\nBut he worries for his three-year-old daughter Holly, who shows signs of ARFID, commonly referred to as \u2018picky eating\u2019.\n\nHe has put on some weight in the last few years (Picture: Colston Hughes)\n\nColston's daily diet 4am: Colston starts work delivering organic food for Abel & Cole\n\nColston starts work delivering organic food for Abel & Cole 6am: A breakfast drink\n\nA breakfast drink 9am: A protein bar\n\nA protein bar 11am: A nourishment drink\n\nA nourishment drink 12pm: Another protein shake after an hour at the gym\n\nAnother protein shake after an hour at the gym 4pm: Weetabix or Cheerios\n\nWeetabix or Cheerios 7-8pm: Two tins of spaghetti (warmed in the microwave) and toasted rolls or toast with peanut butter, followed by a yoghurt and sometimes a chocolate bar \u2018Spaghetti has to be Heinz, always the shaped ones perhaps because I had it lots in childhood, then a yoghurt,\u2019 says Colston. \u2018And then I\u2019ll maybe have a chocolate bar. \u2018My food can\u2019t be touching. I\u2019ve tried it mixed but soggy toast tastes different, it\u2019s the texture. \u2018I also can\u2019t use a knife and fork. I eat my spaghetti shapes with a spoon. \u2018For weekends, I have Weetabix for breakfast and then maybe go the shops and buy crumpets or croissants. For lunch, I have crackers with butter or peanut butter and then two packets of crisps. For dessert, a cake of some sort or doughnuts or cupcake/muffin, or yoghurt and chocolates. Dinner is the same on weekends as weekdays.\u2019 Colston\u2019s food cupboard (Picture: Colston Hughes)\n\nColston tells us: \u2018When I was little, my mum would go to the chippies and I would just eat crisps, I was always skin and bones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018With cooked meals \u2013 the taste, the texture, the smell, the look, it makes me feel sick. I\u2019ll never know how the nation\u2019s favourite food is chips, they feel absolutely horrible. I don\u2019t mind the smell of the chip shop though.\u2019\n\nColston hates chips and would snack on crisps when his mum treated the family to the chippy\u2019s (Picture: Colston Hughes)\n\nNow married and a dad of four, Colson weighs around 11 to 12 stone, having put on three to four stone since meeting his partner, April.\n\nColston finally went to see a doctor for help two years ago. They suspected he had ADHD but didn\u2019t say much about his diet, referring him to the mental health team. He didn\u2019t pursue further treatment as life got in the way.\n\nHe felt the impact of his diet mostly in the morning, when it took an hour to get out of bed as he was so drained. Since taking nourishment drinks and going to the gym, he feels much better.\n\nHe buys in bulk to save money (Picture: Colston Hughes)\n\nBut this hasn\u2019t \u2018cured\u2019 Colston\u2019s issues \u2013 his dietary restrictions still affect both him and his family.\n\n\u2018Our house is like a circus,\u2019 he adds. \u2018When we go out for meals, it\u2019s not spur of the moment because I only eat dessert so I have to eat before we leave, which is a bit stressful when the missus wants just us two to go out for a romantic dinner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s always had a strain on me growing up and dating. Luckily she\u2019s understanding.\n\n\u2018When we first started, I didn\u2019t mention it, wanted her to like me first. Unfortunately, she\u2019s a feeder so she would get angry if I didn\u2019t eat. I told her about my eating after a year.\u2019\n\nColston has to cook meals for his children, and says he\u2019s getting better. He recently mastered cooking up a full English breakfast.\n\nBut his daughter Holly hasn\u2019t been eating those specially cooked meals, raising concerns about her own dietary restrictions.\n\nDoctors told Colston and April that Holly has some signs of autism. They\u2019ve noticed that the three-year-old is also particular with her meals and often throws up if she\u2019s given food that she doesn\u2019t want.\n\nColston insists this can\u2019t be a copycat act, as he\u2019s always eaten his meals away from Holly so she doesn\u2019t imitate his habits.\n\n\u2018My biggest issue is Holly,\u2019 says Colston.\n\nHolly (left) has been showing the same eating habits as her dad (Picture: Colston Hughes)\n\n\u2018She can eat french fries (not chips) and spaghetti hoops (I can\u2019t eat hoops, just the shaped ones). She eats peas, sweetcorn and ham, which I don\u2019t.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never liked meat, I\u2019ve cooked it but don\u2019t feel or like the look of it. It does look appetising, I can\u2019t remember what it tastes like.\n\n\u2018Astonishingly, Holly\u2019s eating habits started when my partner was pregnant. My wife couldn\u2019t eat anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Holly tried spaghetti and liked it and soon she started eating the same as me.\n\n\u2018If it was anything else, she would be sick.\u2019\n\nHolly\u2019s diet began when she was in her mum\u2019s womb (Picture: Colston Hughes)\n\nApril\u2019s diet returned to normal after Holly was born, but Holly continued to be a picky eater. Though Colston worries for his daughter, he also feels a connection to her as a result.\n\n\u2018Part of me loves her eating habits,\u2019 he says, \u2018It\u2019s a bond that only we share. The other part worries, the mental side of it can really get you down.\n\n\u2018But ultimately she\u2019ll never be on her own because I\u2019ll be there.\n\nHolly's diet Breakfast: Usually crisps, but Colston has managed to give her Cheerios. Lunch: Crackers and ham (or with butter). Ham is the only meat Holly eats but she has phases where she won\u2019t eat bread. She also has fruit yoghurts for lunch. Dinner: Rice and sweetcorn \u2013 Holly won\u2019t eat the fish fingers served with this. She has a glass of whole milk because doctors said she would be underweight without it.\n\n\u2018If she\u2019s hungry, she tells us but doesn\u2019t always know so we will take her to the kitchen and she picks out what she wants. She\u2019s the same as me, she was a sickly baby, and has strong reflux, especially now that her tonsils are swollen (we\u2019re waiting to have them taken out).\n\n\u2018I\u2019m at the stage where I\u2019m not going to change too much but when it comes to Holly, I will try to eat better with her so she\u2019s not scared.\n\n\u2018For me, it\u2019s more about helping her.\u2019\n\nAnother thing Holly struggles with is brushing her teeth with toothpaste, which Colston experiences too, being repulsed by the minty taste.\n\nAll the sugar he\u2019s consumed over the years has affected Colston\u2019s teeth, something he doesn\u2019t want his daughter to have to face.\n\nColston says: \u2018I really don\u2019t like mint or toothpaste, I didn\u2019t brush when I was a kid as I would be sick in the morning so I avoided it but now I\u2019m doing it and I\u2019m teaching the kids too.\n\n\u2018Holly hates brushing with toothpaste too but loves brushing with water. I try to get her to use it but luckily she doesn\u2019t eat as much sugar as me.\u2019\n\nFor his whole life, people have said he\u2019s a fussy eater but Colston believes there\u2019s more to his diet. He\u2019s tried to get help for it and \u2018get closure\u2019 but to no avail.\n\nThe family\u2019s hometown is small and has few mental health specialists.\n\nColston\u2019s partner April makes sure the kids are always offered healthy, cooked meals (Picture: Colston Hughes)\n\nColston feels that doctors in the area are \u2018years behind\u2019 everywhere else. He wants more help understanding and dealing with ARFID.\n\n\u2018I know it\u2019s a condition \u2013 my main food is beige food,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019m just figuring out I may have a mental health condition. I just want someone to say \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong with you\u201d, I want the closure of knowing I didn\u2019t make it up.\u2019\n\nWhat is ARFID and how can you treat it? According to Beat, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a condition when a person avoids certain foods or types of food, having restricted intake in terms of overall amount eaten or both. A person might be very sensitive to the taste, texture, smell, or appearance of certain types of food, or only able to eat foods at a certain temperature. This can lead to sensory-based avoidance or restriction of intake. They may have had a distressing experience with food, such as choking or vomiting, or experiencing significant abdominal pain. Treatment for ARFID is usually best tailored to the needs of the individual. Most often, treatment can be delivered in an outpatient setting. It commonly involves family-based treatment (for young people), cognitive behavioural therapy, behavioural interventions such as exposure work, and anxiety management training. Sometimes medication may be suggested, most often to help with anxiety. The person\u2019s physical health should also be monitored and managed, for instance by their GP or a physician or paediatrician. Treatment may also involve nutritional management through support from a dietician, and help with sensory problems.\n\nMORE: Scurvy is on the rise \u2013 beige diets and picky eating might be to blame\n\nMORE: Teenager goes blind after only eating crisps and chocolate for 16 years as he gags at other foods\n\nMORE: Pregnant fruitarian who only eats raw fruit and veg hopes her child will follow the same diet\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Colston Hughes is worried for his daughter, 3, who also shows signs of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID).", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_87999389-e1570011549345_1570018431.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
