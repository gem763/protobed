Before long, it became apparent that she\u2019d headed off to Thailand, and \u2014 in the coming episodes \u2014 she returns from home from her trip, and is horrified to find what\u2019s been going on with her family in her absence.\n\nThe trip will have done Gail the world of good, as her return will bring to light that she\u2019s a bit different than she was when she left. On Gail\u2019s return, Executive Producer Iain MacLeod said: \u2018She\u2019s still the Gail that we recognise but she\u2019s a little more grounded and more mother earth\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She\u2019s still the Gail we know and love but there might be a few more harem pants in her wardrobe and a few more coiffure choices.\u2019\n\nWhile Gail\u2019s return will bring with it the opportunity for viewers to see a different side of the legendary character, it turns out that there was initially a very different narrative in mind for the Weatherfield regular.\n\nWhen asked if Gail had engaged in a holiday romance with anyone, Iain continued: \u2018No, but there was originally a story on the table where she did but we moved away from that in the end just because it felt like we don\u2019t want Gail to get together with another serial killer and if we were going to do it we\u2019d want to do it on-screen rather than off-screen.\u2019\n\nConsidering Gail went to Thailand to get away from stress, it\u2019s safe to say that dating a serial killer would\u2019ve been somewhat counterproductive. What\u2019s more, she\u2019s not had much luck in the romance department over the years, so bringing a serial killer into her life would\u2019ve no doubt have had a huge effect on her \u2014 especially considering it wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\n\nLong-time Corrie viewers will remember that her third husband was none other than iconic serial killer Richard Hillman (Brian Capron), who murdered several cobbles regulars \u2014 most notably Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw) \u2014 before trying to kill the whole Platt family when he famously drove them into the canal.\n\nDiscussing the storyline that was ultimately chosen for Gail\u2019s return, Iain said: \u2018She\u2019s just had a Zen like epiphany. But it won\u2019t turn into a pastiche of hippy lifestyle, she\u2019s still Gail.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The other storyline producers had in mind for Gail would've certainly been a killer choice!", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/25_10_coro_gail_bethany_1st_ep_01-30db_1571227513.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
