And now they\u2019ve stormed the House impeachment inquiry in protest.\n\nMatt Gaetz says he\u2019s about to lead this phalanx of House Republicans into the SCIF to check out what\u2019s going on with the whole impeachment thing pic.twitter.com/iFyxqMgcsr \u2014 Sam Brodey (@sambrodey) October 23, 2019\n\nUnfortunately, Trump supporters\u2019 arguments are making less and less sense. The goal posts are moving, and the obfuscations and outright falsifications are proliferating.\n\nLet\u2019s run through some of the most-trafficked defenses, and what\u2019s wrong with them.\n\nAD\n\n1. Quid pro quos happen all the time\n\nAs evidence of a quid pro quo involving Trump\u2019s politically expedient investigations has piled up, his supporters have in some cases ditched arguing there was no quid pro quo. Instead, they have suggested quid pro quos are just standard practice.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy,\u201d acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said last week, after saying military aid to Ukraine was withheld in part because Ukraine wasn\u2019t investigating a Trump conspiracy theory.\n\nSome, like Washington Post contributing columnist Hugh Hewitt, have even likened the situation to agreements between governments, such as the Louisiana Purchase.\n\nAD\n\n\"I'll take Quid Pro Quos for $1,000 Alex\"\n\n\"U.S. acquired approximately 827,000 square miles of land west of Mississippi river for $15 million.\"\n\n\"What is Seward's Folly?\"\n\n\"Sorry @Steelers fans, it is 'What is the Louisiana Purchase, the Louisiana Purchase.'\" #QuidProQuoJeopardy \u2014 Hugh Hewitt (@hughhewitt) October 23, 2019\n\nOf course quid pro quos are part of government work. What this is really about is whether there was a corrupt quid pro quo. The question is whether the quid pro quo involved Trump\u2019s personally desired investigations, which could help him politically.\n\nThe fact that Mulvaney reeled in his admission says it all. He and the Trump team know that a quid pro quo in which the aid was withheld more broadly over Ukraine rooting out its own corruption would be legitimate; if it was withheld for personal favors for Trump, that\u2019s far different.\n\nAD\n\nIt would be like if the Louisiana Purchase involved Thomas Jefferson not buying territory west of the Mississippi River from France in 1803, but instead spending $15 million of government money for damaging information about his 1804 opponent, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (who just so happened to be a former U.S. minister to France).\n\nAD\n\n2. They didn\u2019t know Burisma was about the Bidens\n\nA related defense to the one above is this: Maybe there was an explicit quid pro quo on an investigation involving the Bidens, but those involved didn\u2019t know it involved the Bidens. They just knew it involved the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma Holdings, whose board Hunter Biden happened to serve on.\n\n\u201cI recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about former vice president Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified last week. He added that as of August, \u201cI did not know until more recent press reports that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOutgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry added Wednesday morning on Hewitt\u2019s radio show: \u201cIn our conversations dealing with this issue, I never heard the president say the words \u2018Biden.\u2019 I never heard the word Biden mentioned, not from him, not from staff, not from the E.U. ambassador, not from [former special envoy to Ukraine] Kurt Volker.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s he thing, though: Trump and his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani made no secret that this was about the Bidens. There was a major controversy in May \u2014 before many of the key events here played out \u2014 in which Giuliani planned and then canceled a trip to Ukraine he explicitly say was meant to push for these investigations. Trump himself invoked the Bidens publicly on May 19.\n\nGiuliani also admitted at the time that he was trying to help Trump personally.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSomebody could say it\u2019s improper,\u201d he conceded of his planned Ukraine trip. He added: \u201cI\u2019m going to give them reasons they shouldn\u2019t stop [investigating], because that information will be very, very helpful to my client and may turn out to be helpful to my government.\u201d\n\nIf people didn\u2019t know the true reason for the Burisma push, it\u2019s difficult to believe it wasn\u2019t a willful ignorance. They would have had to be burying their heads in the sand.\n\n3. The whistleblower has been proven wrong\n\nThis one keeps popping up. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted it Wednesday before getting an approving retweet from Trump.\n\nIt never ends. The Do Nothing Dems are terrible! https://t.co/l7Qk0WU8ML \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2019\n\nBut the rough transcript released by the White House of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shows the whistleblower had almost all of the key details about it correct. The other major accusation that the whistleblower made \u2014 that the White House put the transcript in a codeword-level computer system \u2014 has also been confirmed by the White House.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor more on how correct the whistleblower has turned out to be, see here, here and here.\n\nMuch of the information was secondhand, meaning more investigation was necessary. But that investigation is now taking place. No longer do we have to depend on an anonymous complaint, because firsthand witnesses are confirming it on the record and under oath. Even if certain details from the whistleblower might not pan out, that\u2019s pretty well beside the point right now.\n\n4. Trump isn\u2019t getting due process in House inquiry\n\nRepublicans have decried the secretive nature of the House impeachment inquiry process, noting the depositions are taking place behind closed doors and that witnesses aren\u2019t allowed to have government lawyers at their side. This was at the heart of the scene Wednesday morning.\n\nAD\n\nAs to the second one, The Post\u2019s Paul Kane notes that would be against House rules.\n\nAD\n\n\u201c3. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by personal, nongovernmental counsel to advise them of their rights. Only members, committee staff designated by the chair\n\nor ranking minority member, an official reporter, witness, and witness's counsel are permitted to attend.\u201d \u2014 Paul Kane (@pkcapitol) October 18, 2019\n\nAs Just Security notes, the Justice Department has argued that excluding such counsel \u201cwould impair the President\u2019s constitutional authority to control the disclosure of privileged information and to supervise the executive branch\u2019s communications with Congress.\u201d But allowing the White House to supervise and withhold information during impeachment proceedings is problematic, at best. And the Justice Departments view is a guideline \u2014 not the law.\n\nAs to due process: The impeachment inquiry is not a trial \u2014 it is akin to an investigation, in which there are not opportunities to present competing narratives. The trial occurs in the Senate if Trump is impeached by the House, where all of that can take place. What\u2019s more, there are Republican members in these depositions who can effectively cross-examine the witnesses.\n\nAD\n\nWhether the proceedings should be more public is up for debate. Holding them in secret prevents witnesses from coordinating their testimony, and it also prevents potential grandstanding. That cost is transparency and a fear that the picture we\u2019re getting might be slanted. Democrats have said they will release everything at some point, though, and media has obtained statements from some witnesses.\n\nAD\n\nThe White House has cited this lack of due process for its refusal to cooperate with the inquiry. John Yoo had a good piece on this that noting that the House isn\u2019t required to provide any of these things, even as perhaps it should.\n\n5. An abuse of power is not a crime\n\nThis was a new one on Tuesday night, and it may seem like an uncharitable paraphrase. But it\u2019s what former acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew G. Whitaker said on Fox News.\n\nMatthew Whitaker: Abuse of power is not a crime pic.twitter.com/IJsEwRTs8N \u2014 Acyn Torabi (@Acyn) October 23, 2019\n\n\u201cAbuse of power is not a crime,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cLet\u2019s fundamentally boil it down. The Constitution\u2019s very clear that this has to be some pretty egregious behavior.\u201d\n\nThe idea that abuse of power isn\u2019t a crime is highly debatable. It depends on what the abuse is and whether it involves trading government favors for personal gain. Some have argued this could also amount to extortion of Ukraine or campaign finance violations.\n\nAD\n\nBut impeachment doesn\u2019t require a crime. It requires \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d That\u2019s a subjective standard in some ways, but you could make an argument that there is some bribery taking place. In addition, scholars have said an abuse of power is exactly what the Founding Fathers had in mind for impeachment.\n\n6. Ukraine didn\u2019t know about the frozen military aid\n\nImplicit in some of the arguments is that, even if the military aid was held up for leverage on particular investigations, Ukraine didn\u2019t even know about it.\n\nTrump tweeted as much on Wednesday morning, quoting Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.): \u201cNeither he (Taylor) or any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. You can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo.\u201d\n\nNeither he (Taylor) or any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. You can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo.\u201d Congressman John Ratcliffe @foxandfriends Where is the Whistleblower? The Do Nothing Dems case is DEAD! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2019\n\nJust hours later, the New York Times reported that Ukraine did in fact know about the frozen aid, as of early August:\n\nBut in fact, word of the aid freeze had gotten to high-level Ukrainian officials by the first week in August, according to interviews and documents obtained by The New York Times. The problem was not a bureaucratic glitch, the Ukrainians were told then. To address it, they were advised, they should reach out to Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, according to the interviews and records.\n\nKnowing about this in early August would have given Ukraine weeks to understand the leverage potentially being used against them before the aid was restored in mid-September \u2014 and these were weeks during which Ukraine\u2019s public message about launching the investigations was being negotiated between both sides.", "description": "The moving goalposts, the obfuscation and the outright falsification.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4IQUDQsv1Ntz2FToXAMEAVQWzDI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TAB7PIXVUII6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
