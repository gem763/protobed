Family members want to know, and the authorities have agreed to allow his exhumation.\n\nDillinger and his heavily armed \u201cTerror Gang\u201d robbed at least a dozen banks \u2014 killing 10 men, including a police officer, in the process \u2014 during the 1930s. He escaped from jail three times, stole submachine guns from police armories, and fashioned a well-earned reputation as \u201cPublic Enemy Number One.\u201d\n\nDescribed by the FBI as a \u201cnotorious and vicious thief,\u201d Dillinger regularly made Page One of American newspapers, fanning fears and seizing the public imagination in the midst of the Great Depression.\n\nHis bloody career ended in 1934, when Dillinger was killed in a shootout with federal agents as he left a Chicago movie theater where he and two female friends had seen the Clark Gable movie \u201cManhattan Melodrama,\u201d police said.\n\nAnd it was Dillinger, the FBI said, who was buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in his native Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nBut some Dillinger relatives are not so sure.\n\nIn a sworn declaration accompanying an exhumation request, Carol Thompson, Dillinger\u2019s niece, said she had new information suggesting that the man in the grave is not the infamous bank robber.\n\nShe said records of his eye color, scar shape, teeth condition and fingerprints did not match up.\n\n\u201cIt is my belief and opinion that it is critical to learn whether Dillinger lived beyond his reported date of death of July 22, 1934,\u201d she said in the affidavit.\n\n\u201cIf he was not killed on that date, I am interested in discovering what happened to him, where he lived, whether he had children, and whether any such children or grandchildren are living today.\u201d\n\nThe FBI dismissed this possibility. The agency\u2019s Chicago office tweeted that \u201ca wealth of information supports Dillinger\u2019s demise.\u201d The notion that it was a Dillinger Doppelganger who died instead, the FBI said, was a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d\n\nBut the Indiana Health Department on Thursday gave its consent to the disinterment of the body in the Indianapolis grave, tentatively setting a date of December 31.\n\nThe cemetery has opposed the exhumation, however, and the matter may end up in court.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Is it in fact the notorious American gangster John Dillinger who lies buried in an Indiana cemetery?
