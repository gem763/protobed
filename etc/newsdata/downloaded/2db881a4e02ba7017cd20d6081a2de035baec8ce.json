The paper is in line with the Integrated Resources Plan which promotes a diversified energy mix for the country. It also outlines how government plans to unbundle the power utility into three entities \u2013 transmission, generation and distribution which will fall under Eskom holdings, by the end of 2022.\n\nThe paper lays out proposals for turning around the power utility's dire financial position with cost saving measures. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni is expected to make announcements at the mini budget addressing Eskom's R450bn debt.\n\nThe plan also acknowledges the need for a just transition \u2013 ensuring that communities and workers of Eskom are not negatively impacted through the unbundling process and as the power utility moves away fossil fuels to alternative, cleaner energy sources.\n\nCosatu however regards the paper as a \"draft\" and wants to engage with government and other social partners within the National Economic Development and Labour Council.\n\nParks said the labour federation and its affiliate the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) will not be \"bulldozed\" into accepting a road map that does not address workers' concerns about their jobs, communities, energy affordability and security of supply.\n\n\"The paper's silence about job security and a lack of a commitment not to retrench workers is extremely worrying and is condemned in the strongest possible terms by Cosatu and NUM,\" Parks said.\n\nHe added that the paper lacks clarity on the unbundling of Eskom. \"Government has not shown how this will reduce costs or improve efficiency.\n\n\"Labour's fear is that in fact it may increase costs by requiring more CEOs, management and boards. Workers fear that it may lead to full blown retrenchments and privatisation through the back door.\n\n\"Any attempts to retrench workers will lead to massive strikes by not only NUM but the entire federation and its affiliates,\" Parks warned.\n\nBut there were some parts of the paper Cosatu supported \u2013 such as interventions by government to ensure Independent Power Producers and coal suppliers sell their generation and coal at affordable prices to Eskom, Parks said.\n\nWhile Pravin Gordhan told journalists at a briefing on the paper that a new CEO would be announced next week, Parks said that it is an \"indictment\" that one of the most important state-owned enterprises in the country has been without a CEO for six months.\n\n\"There are significant gaps and weaknesses in the paper. Cosatu and NUM however will be engaging government on addressing these key issues and in particular to ensure no worker is retrenched and the survival of Eskom,' Parks said. The engagements will take place through the Nedlac vehicle and the tripartite alliance, he added.\n\nMeanwhile energy expert Chris Yelland said the paper is a good starting point to move forward for Eskom. He acknowledged that details might have to be filled along the way, but stressed it\u2019s important not to create any delays of effecting a turnaround at Eskom. \"If we do not start now, we will not be finished in five-years' time or 10-years' time,\" Yelland told Fin24 by phone.", "description": "Labour federation Cosatu has said it will engage with government on the recently released special paper marking out a roadmap for Eskom.", "authors": ["Lameez Omarjee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4120/bb9ac6162aa54c45a195b6bdb53c391a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
