But in Mexico, that date\u2014the anniversary of a military triumph over Napoleon on May 5, 1862\u2014is marked by a parade and not much else. The real celebrations happen on September 16, which is Mexican Independence Day. At Gastropod, we\u2019re always down to party, so here\u2019s to Mexico\u2019s true national holiday, and its true national dish: mole. But what is mole? Listen in this episode as we trace mole\u2019s complicated evolution from medieval Moors to the invention of the blender, and from something that had been considered peasant food to a special-occasion showstopper.\n\nRachel Laudan is a food historian and the author of Cuisine and Empire: Cooking in World History\u2014but, when she started researching mole, the first document she uncovered was hardly deep in the archives. When she first visited Mexico, in the 1990s, Laudan went to a restaurant famous for its mole. \u201cAnd, of course, they had the statutory place mat with the story of mole poblano being invented in a convent in the 18th century,\u201d she told us.\n\nAccording to the origin story on the place mat, some nuns, in a panic because an archbishop was visiting and they had nothing to serve him, threw a bunch of spices in a pot and somehow came up with the perfect rich, chocolate-brown sauce. \u201cThat, to me, just sounds like propaganda,\u201d says Fernando Lopez, one of three siblings whose father founded Guelaguetza, an Angeleno restaurant that is a temple to Oaxacan mole. He believes mole is far too complex to have been created overnight. Plus, mole comes in many varieties and colors. Guelaguetza serves six kinds of mole\u2014mole negro, mole rojo, mole coloradito, mole amarillo, mole verde, and mole estofado\u2014but Sandra Aguilar-Rodriguez, an associate professor of Latin American history at Moravian College, in Pennsylvania, told us that she could name 10 versions off the top of her head, and that each town in the south of Mexico has its own variations on the classic recipes.", "description": "How indigenous tradition, Old World ingredients, Islamic cuisine, and a convent combined to make mole a staple", "authors": ["Nicola Twilley", "Cynthia Graber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_909767530/facebook.jpg?1568235898", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
