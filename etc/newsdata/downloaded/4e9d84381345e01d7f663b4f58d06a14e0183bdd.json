They seem entirely natural to me and to most people in Scotland,\" she said.\n\n\"The best starting point I can think of is a speech made by Chancellor Merkel at this event a few years ago.\n\n\"She argued then that a country's policies represent its interests based on its values.\n\n\"Scotland is and I think always will be a European nation, a committed supporter of the European Union, not because we think the European Union is flawless, nor even simply because membership of the European Union is so obviously in our interests. But perhaps most importantly of all because membership of the European Union accords so strongly with our values as a country.\"\n\nSturgeon used the speech to condemn British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend the UK's parliament.\n\n\"That decision... was declared last week by Scotland's highest civil court to be an unlawful decision,\" she continued.\n\n\"And, of course, it is now subject to a hearing before the UK's Supreme Court this week, which will lead to a decision perhaps later this week or early next week. And that judgment potentially will take the United Kingdom into even greater uncharted waters.\"\n\nSturgeon insisted that whatever happened she saw Scotland's long-term future as a member of the EU.\n\n\"Even if Scotland is forced to leave the EU, we will work hard to maintain EU standards and will, therefore, I hope, be better placed to rejoin in the future,\" she said.\n\n\"But of course there is a limited amount that the Scottish Government can do within the current system, which is why I believe it is also right to offer the people of Scotland a choice of becoming an independent country and seeking to become an EU member state in our own rate.\"", "description": "Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been given an award by the German media for being \"the voice of reason\" in the Brexit crisis.", "authors": ["John Paul Ging"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/16/56/68/1000x563_cmsv2_a04aac62-79f2-54c0-a811-d42e61af9710-4165668.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
