'These should reflect at least distance driven, and ideally vary according to when and where journeys take place,' it said.\n\nThose driving in busy places would pay more, but most journeys would be taxed less heavily than at present, it added.\n\nThe Treasury is facing the loss of \u00a328billion in revenue as people switch to tax-free electric cars, say experts (pictured: the front of the Treasury Office in London)\n\nRebekah Stroud, a research economist at the IFS and co-author of the IFS Green Budget, said: 'Another 2p cut [in fuel duty], as reportedly mooted by the Prime Minister, would cost a further \u00a31billion a year.\n\n'The bigger challenge is that revenues are now set to disappear entirely over coming decades as we transition to electric cars.\n\n'The Government should set out its long-term plan for taxing driving, before it finds itself with virtually no revenues from driving.'", "description": "The Government has pledged to make Britain carbon neutral by 2050, which means it will lose revenue from fuel duty.
