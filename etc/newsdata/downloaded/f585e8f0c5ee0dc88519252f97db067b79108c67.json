I spent a long time researching locations and angles to get a dramatic picture, and settled on the iconic cathedral in Mdina, Malta\u2019s ancient capital city.\n\nUsing a newly-purchased iPhone app, I could work out precisely where and when the moon would appear between the church steeples and the best position to photograph the moment.\n\nAs the appointed time drew nearer, I began to feel nervous \u2013 what if I hadn\u2019t used the app properly and messed up the calculations? I joked to a photographer friend, who had joined me for the evening, that if I got it wrong I might actually transform into a werewolf (part of my surname, Lupi, is the Italian word for wolves).\n\nI heaved a huge and very audible sigh of relief as I spotted the rim of the moon appearing bang on cue and precisely where it was supposed to.\n\nI took my pictures using a 400mm long lens and 1.4x extender mounted on a sturdy tripod and I shifted position slightly as the moon climbed higher. When it was too high to photograph, I packed my gear and headed back to the car. It had been a long, hot day and I wanted to grab a snack and drink while filing my pictures, so we headed towards Mdina, but couldn\u2019t find a parking spot.\n\nI knew a good caf\u00e9 in a nearby town but we arrived to find it closed. Unwilling to delay any further, I parked outside the caf\u00e9 and quickly edited and filed what I thought were the best couple of images.\n\nThat done, I figured I should call it a day and drop my friend off home. I had a couple of route options and luckily, I chose the more complicated of the two. We drove past the town of Mosta, close to a field where villagers were launching fireworks to celebrate the local feast day of Our Lady of the Assumption, which falls on August 15.\n\nFrom a fleeting glance, it seemed nice, but I figured the firework displays would continue for the rest of the week so I could always come back the next day.\n\nI kept my eyes on the road as the car shook from the blasts of the explosions. A second fleeting glance changed everything. \u201cThe moon!\u201d I yelled to my friend over the cacophony of bangs; the fireworks were exploding directly in front of it.\n\nWe had a hurried discussion about whether to stop, but there didn\u2019t seem to be anywhere to park and traffic was building up. I headed down into an adjacent valley, looking for a good spot away from the crowds where I\u2019d be able to set up and shoot.\n\nThat didn\u2019t work out, so we drove back up to the main road and parked at a bus stop. It was late, so hopefully there wouldn\u2019t be any buses. Carrying lots of heavy gear, we ran, panting, to a good spot from where we could photograph the moon behind the fireworks.\n\nViewing the moon through the 400mm lens surrounded by the fireworks\u2019 multitude of colours was unlike anything I\u2019d ever seen before.\n\nKnowing the exposure would be tricky, I shot the images in RAW format to give me a bit more flexibility, should I need it afterwards. I played with some different exposure combinations to see which gave the best results, and was instantly stunned by what I managed to capture. The images looked unreal.\n\nI had been watching the 1970s TV show \u201cSpace 1999\u201d as well as my \u201cStar Wars\u201d DVD set, and it was as if these pictures came right out of the television - exploding stars and planets, supernovas, the moon drifting through clouds of interplanetary cosmic dust and gas in space.\n\nI was on a high. This was so radically different to the pictures I usually take that I couldn\u2019t get enough of it. We quickly forgot that we had been thirsty and famished.\n\nLater that night, I stayed awake until early hours, editing. Looking back at the sequence of events, if I\u2019d managed to find a parking spot outside Mdina, if the caf\u00e9 had been open or if I\u2019d driven down one road and not the other, I\u2019d have missed what has been my most enjoyable and successful shoot this year and I\u2019d be none the wiser. Serendipity can be a beautiful thing when it works out well!", "description": "The supermoon, a celestial phenomenon when the moon appears especially big and bright, is a visual delight in itself.
