Biden of meddling in Ukraine. Political insiders say it\u2019s a strong indication of how Mr. Trump intends to fight back.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be very aggressive,\u201d said Republican strategist John Feehery. \u201cI think ultimately his game plan is to make sure the base is with him. He understands this is a political fight, not a legal fight, and he\u2019s going to play politics. He knows that if he loses the base, he loses the game.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump and his aides in the early days of the crisis have gone on the attack against an unnamed government whistleblower who prompted the charges while also firing back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Chairman Adam B. Schiff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The White House message is that this latest political peril for Mr. Trump is all part of the same partisan hatred that has dogged him from the start.\n\n\u201cThere are no high crimes and misdemeanors here,\u201d said White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. \u201cPeople were talking about impeaching this president before he even got inaugurated. And now they\u2019re getting their wish. Nancy Pelosi finally capitulated to her angry mob.\u201d\n\nShe said the American people \u201cwill see what\u2019s not getting done\u201d in Congress while Democrats devote their attention to impeaching Mr. Trump in a strong economy.\n\nThe president also echoed a prediction Sunday by Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel that the Democrats\u2019 impeachment effort will backfire, especially in Democratic House districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016.\n\n\u201cWill happen to all of those seeking unlawful impeachment in 50 Trump type Districts,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cWe will win big!\u201d\n\nIn trying to sustain his 2020 reelection bid, Mr. Trump is still fighting a battle over his 2016 campaign.\n\nThe president\u2019s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 started with pleasantries, but quickly shifted Mr. Trump\u2019s interest in a missing Democratic National Committee server that was hacked by Russia during the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine \u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it,\u201d the president told Mr. Zelensky.\n\nHe also mentioned the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which the DNC hired in 2016 to investigate the breach of its servers and first reported Russia as the culprit.\n\nThe president\u2019s conversation took place a day after special counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress, an appearance that was criticized as weak. Mr. Mueller did confirm the findings of his report, which found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the election.\n\n\u201cAs you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance,\u201d Mr. Trump told Ukraine\u2019s leader. \u201cBut they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it\u2019s very important that you do it if that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has announced that U.S. attorney John Durham, who is investigating the origins of the FBI\u2019s \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d probe into alleged links between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russia, was already looking into whether the Ukrainian government led by then-President Petro Poroshenko was involved in the effort to torpedo Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nMr. Zelensky raised the name of the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani had canceled a trip to Ukraine last spring to investigate whether the previous Ukrainian administration helped Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign by providing information concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u2019s lobbying work in the country.\n\nMr. Giuliani also was probing why Ukraine fired Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who had been looking into Hunter Biden\u2019s lucrative position with a Ukrainian energy company.\n\n\u201cThis is what they [Democrats] did to Manafort,\u201d said veteran Washington lawyer John Down, who represented the president in the Mueller probe. \u201cThey went overseas and they dug all this stuff up. What\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander.\u201d\n\nThe Hill reported in May that the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington said a Democratic National Committee contractor solicited dirt on Manafort during the 2016 campaign and even tried to enlist the country\u2019s president to help.\n\nThe contractor later tried to arrange for Mr. Poroshenko to comment on Manafort\u2019s Russian ties during a visit to the U.S. during the 2016 campaign, the Ukrainian ambassador said.\n\nAs for Mr. Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, the president\u2019s conservative allies also believe there is a potential connection to the origins of the Russia allegations against Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cBiden was responsible for U.S. policy in Ukraine during the Obama administration, and much of the false narrative about President Donald Trump being a Russian agent came from Ukraine, the United Kingdom and other Western intelligence agencies, which his administration put a bow on and shipped to the FISA court so they could spy on the Trump campaign in 2016,\u201d said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government. \u201cWhat did Joe Biden know about Russiagate and when did he know it?\u201d\n\nThe president also has directed most of his campaign criticism at Mr. Biden, perceiving him as his likeliest \u2014 and probably toughest \u2014 opponent in the general election. He\u2019s gone to considerable lengths to take him out early during the Democratic primary, openly questioning his fitness for office.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s the weakest mentally, and I like running against people that are weak mentally,\u201d the president said of Mr. Biden last summer.\n\nDemocrats are using the president\u2019s effort to investigate the Bidens in Ukraine as their primary argument for impeachment, accusing the president of seeking foreign help in interfering in a U.S. election. Mr. Biden is, for now, still the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.\n\nAt the time of the phone call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI think we have to stay focused as far as the public is concerned on the fact that the president of the United States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country for his own political gain,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday.\n\nMrs. Pelosi also suggested that Russia played a role in the saga.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong for any foreign government to interfere in our elections and here you have the president of the United States asking for that,\u201d she said without elaborating. \u201cI think Russia has a hand in this, by the way.\u201d\n\nThe White House ended the week with Mr. Trump declaring \u201cwe\u2019re at war\u201d with the Democrats. The president and his allies were also questioning the motives of the unnamed government whistleblower, who\u2019s reportedly a CIA officer.\n\nMr. Trump last week also suggested he could go to court to stop the Democrats.\n\n\u201cThere should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nEven some Republicans close to the White House say impeachment is a real concern.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a good chance of impeachment,\u201d said one administration ally. \u201cWill he be removed [by the Senate]? No. Will he even care? I think he thinks it would be one more big reality TV moment, and he\u2019s the star of it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
