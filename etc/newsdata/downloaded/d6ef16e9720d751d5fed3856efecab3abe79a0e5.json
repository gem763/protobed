USA TODAY\n\nSpoiler alert! This story contains details from \"The Masked Singer\" Season 2, Episode 3, including the identity of the eliminated celebrity.\n\nThe masked madness continues.\n\n\"Masked Singer\" returned Wednesday with four new celebrity contestants \u2013 Flower, Penguin, Fox and Eagle \u2013 all looking to stay in the competition.\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nFlower versus Eagle\n\nFirst up was Flower. She showcased her serious singing chops on a soulful rendition of Dolly Parton\u2019s \"9 to 5\u201d that left the judges saying, \"We are not worthy.\" Jenny McCarthy added, \"I\u2019m so speechless.\" She guessed Taraji P. Henson because the singer said she had an \"empire,\" but the other judges disagreed. \"No way, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an actress,\" Nicole Scherzinger said. She picked Patti LaBelle, while Robin Thicke guessed Jennifer Hudson because \"there\u2019s only a few people in the world \u2026 who can hit those notes.\"\n\nLast week on 'The Masked Singer': Robin Thicke (jokingly) guessed this unmasked star right!\n\nFlower added that she's \"dipped my petals in just about everything\" from cooking to crafts and clothing.\n\nNext up was Eagle. His comedic rendition of Meat Loaf\u2019s \"I'd Do Anything for Love\" didn\u2019t give the judge\u2019s any more clarity on his identity. So McCarthy turned to his appearance, saying, \"You have the legs of Howard Stern.\" Scherzinger believed it could be Bret Michaels because of his red bandanna. Thicke guessed Pauly Shore because Eagle said he lost a parent, like Shore, whose mother died in April 2018.\n\nEagle's hint? \"I have soared to great heights as the face of my field, but now after a serious health scare \u2026 I've realized that life is too short to let my dreams fly by.\"\n\nThe audience and the judges elected Flower's performance as their favorite, sending Eagle to the brink of elimination.\n\nPenguin versus Fox\n\nPenguin strutted her stuff during Zedd, Maren Morris and Grey\u2019s \u201cThe Middle.\u201d Scherzinger said, \"You were out of your comfort zone but looked like you had a lot of fun out there.\" She guessed Megan Mullally because of a sign that said \"I\u2019m not your secretary.\" Thicke said she danced like McCarthy's cousin, Melissa McCarthy. However, McCarthy picked Kathy Griffin because Penguin said her career ended abruptly.\n\nPenguin's hint? \"Everything is not as black and white as it seems.\" Ken Jeong responded, \"Maybe someone who is color blind.\"\n\nLast up was Fox, who displayed his dance moves and vocals on Maroon 5\u2019s \u201cThis Love.\" Thicke said, \"He moved like a professional performer.\" McCarthy believed it\u2019s a Broadway star, like Leslie Odom Jr. Scherzinger thought his \"onscreen superhero\" clue could mean Anthony Mackie. Jeong picked Tyrese Gibson and then switched to Jamie Foxx, again.\n\nThe masked singer's hint? He does his \"best work at night.\"\n\nFox's genuine talent and stage presence beat out Penguin's upbeat attitude, leading to a smackdown between Eagle and Penguin. Only one would stay.\n\nEagle did a playful rendition of \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" by Nancy Sinatra, while Penguin busted out the dance moves on Fifth Harmony\u2019s \"Worth It.\" Penguin's moves paid off because she won the battle, leaving Eagle as the fourth contestant to be unmasked.\n\n\"It was like a weird episode of 'Angry Bird,'\" McCarthy quipped.\n\nShe added, \"This was a tough one for us.\" McCarthy's final guess was Adam Carolla. Thicke picked Stern. Jeong guessed Craig Ferguson. Nicole selected Jeff Foxworthy.\n\nThey were all wrong. It was Dr. Drew Pinsky, the host of \"Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew\" and \"Loveline.\" He described his time on the show as \"very bizarre.\"\n\nThicke exclaimed, \"I didn\u2019t see that coming at all. McCathy said she was \"so close\" to a correct guess by choosing Carolla, Pinsky's \"Loveline\" co-host.\n\nPinsky joins unmasked singers boxing champion Laila Ali (Panda), Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir (Egg) and gaming YouTuber Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins (Ice Cream). Four celebs down, 12 to go.\n\nSee our full coverage of entertainment news\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/09/the-masked-singer-jenny-mccarthy-so-close-guessing-eagle/3926113002/", "description": "Eagle's hint? \"I have\u00a0soared to great heights as the face of my field, but now after a serious health scare \u2026 I've realized that life is too short.\"", "authors": ["Cydney Henderson", "Published P.M.
