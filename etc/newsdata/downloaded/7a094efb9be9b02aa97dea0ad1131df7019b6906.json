Others thought differently.\n\nMorris Siegel, the popular columnist for the Washington Star, growled, \u201cWe\u2019ll have a new team in town in two years.\u201d It didn\u2019t take two years \u2014 more like 33 \u2014 and sadly neither Povich nor Siegel was alive to see the euphoric emotion from the more than 43,000 fans at Nationals Park last Tuesday when the Nationals defeated the St. Louis Cardinals, 7-4, to vault them into the first World Series in Washington since 1933.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 28 of the 33 years Washington went without major league baseball, I was the sports editor of The Post, responsible for directing coverage of the attempts to bring the game back to a city that was a founding member of the American League for 71 years. Of course, the original Senators moved to Minnesota in 1961, replaced immediately by an inept expansion team, later to be owned by Short and moved to Texas.\n\nThe party line held by many in baseball was that Washington was not a baseball town and didn\u2019t support the two teams that fled the city. It was a theory discounted by many, led by Povich, who until his death in 1998 at the age of 92 after a 75-year career at The Post believed his adopted city was getting a bad rap, the victim of terrible ownership (Calvin Griffith and Short) and other shortsighted club owners dominating the game.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a big league ball team in town, you\u2019re not a big league city,\u201d said Povich, who retired as a full-time columnist from The Post in 1974 but returned as an underpaid (guilty) part-time columnist and sage adviser when I got the job as sports editor in 1975.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Redskins were dominating the headlines as they had since 1969, when Vince Lombardi became their coach, replaced after his untimely 1970 death by George Allen in 1971. The Bullets, under Abe and Irene Pollin, were about to move to the District from Baltimore, and the Capitals were still a dream in their heads. Maryland basketball, under Lefty Driesell, was making waves. The Orioles were a short drive away, so who needs a baseball team?\n\n\u201cWashington needs a baseball team,\u201d Povich said.\n\nAnd the city almost got one, as early as 1973, when Joseph Danzansky, the president of Giant Food, signed an agreement to buy the San Diego Padres from C. Arnholt Smith for $12 million. In December 1973, the owners even approved the sale. Some dope (me) was assigned to write profiles of the Padres for a special baseball section, and the move seemed like such a sure thing that Topps produced trading cards of Padres players saying they played for \u201cWashington\u201d of the \u201cNat\u2019l Lea.\u201d The team\u2019s general manager, Peter Bavasi , even made a trip to Washington to begin preparations for the move. But San Diego mayor Pete Wilson got involved. He convinced some guy who made hamburgers for a living (Ray Kroc of McDonald\u2019s) to buy the team and keep it in San Diego.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the next three-plus decades, teams and politicians played footsie with Washington, often using the city as a lever to better their own situations and obtain new ballparks. The San Francisco Giants were freezing in Candlestick Park, the Chicago White Sox had wandering eyes, and the Cleveland Indians were dying in an 80,000-seat stadium. Virginian William Collins reached an agreement to buy the Houston Astros in 1995. They would play two years in RFK Stadium and then move to a new stadium near Dulles International Airport. But the deal fell through; the Astros got a new stadium. Anytime a congressman wanted a mention in the newspaper, he or she just had to say Washington deserves a baseball team.\n\nThe killer for Povich, though, was the expansion process: Montreal (began play in 1969), Toronto (1977), Miami and Denver (1993), Tampa and Arizona (1998). No Washington.\n\n\u201cDenver,\u201d an angry Povich wrote. \u201cA shtetl of a city.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHow can you call Denver a shtetl?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cShtetl,\u201d he pronounced flatly, digging his fingers into my arm, suggesting someone on the sports staff should call his friend, a local developer named Ted Lerner, who he said has the money to own and keep a baseball team in Washington.\n\nSome saw opportunities during the 33-year vacuum. For years during the 1980s, RFK Stadium was the site of an annual five-inning game called the \u201cCracker Jack Old Timers Baseball Classic\u201d that featured Sandy Koufax (one batter faced), Bob Feller, Whitey Ford, Roger Maris, Warren Spahn and Joe DiMaggio. Some teams played exhibition games in the District, including the Orioles, Pirates and Cardinals.\n\nAD\n\nPovich never attended any of those games, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not Chattanooga\u201d (a frequent stop of the Senators\u2019 money-making train on the way north after spring training). Nor could he figure out baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn, a Washingtonian who might have helped his city but didn\u2019t.\n\nAD\n\nThe Orioles were an odd case: a onetime powerful, exciting team, managed by Earl Weaver and featuring Cal Ripken, only about one hour from D.C., on local television and radio, covered by The Post, the Washington Star and later the Washington Times. In 1979, the team was purchased by Washington attorney Edward Bennett Williams, who for years also was the president of the Redskins. There was speculation Williams wanted to move the Orioles to Washington and a story in The Post that he hoped to play a dozen games at RFK Stadium in 1980. The story might have helped push Baltimore to build Oriole Park at Camden Yards.\n\nEli Jacobs bought the Orioles after Williams\u2019s death in 1988, followed by Peter Angelos. The Orioles always believed the Washington area was vital to their financial success and had the general support of commissioner Bud Selig. But when the Expos floundered in Montreal and Major League Baseball had to take ownership of the team, Washington was easily the best landing spot once the city agreed to finance a stadium.\n\nAD\n\nPovich and his friend Siegel were huge believers in reporters and columnists keeping neutral postures when covering sports. They didn\u2019t root, and Povich said he stopped \u201cgodding up\u201d players in the 1930s. Somehow, though, both of them and a huge number of Washington baseball fans were smiling from above Nationals Park last Tuesday night.\n\nGeorge Solomon was assistant managing editor for sports at The Washington Post from 1975 to 2003.
