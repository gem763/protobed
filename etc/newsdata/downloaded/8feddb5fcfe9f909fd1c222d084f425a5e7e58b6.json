Kamala Harris\u2019 rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination disagree with the California senator\u2019s calls for the suspension of President Trump\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii told Fox News she's not on board with that effort. \u201cI will stand up for every American\u2019s right and freedom of speech, no matter how strongly I may disagree with that speech. This freedom is the First Amendment of the Constitution for a reason and I will do all I can to stand up for it,\u201d Gabbard said Thursday while campaigning in New Hampshire.\n\nWARREN LAUGHS OFF HARRIS SUGGESTION TO BOOT TRUMP FROM TWITTER\n\nAnd Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts offered a simple \"no\" when asked by reporters if she thought the Republican president should be booted from Twitter. The Massachusetts Democrat chuckled as she gave her one-word answer on Wednesday.\n\nHarris called this week for the president\u2019s Twitter account to be shut down. This followed a storm of tweets by Trump critical of the whistleblower who filed a complaint against him over the Ukraine controversy. That controversy has spurred a House impeachment inquiry.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nTrump, in a tweet, also questioned whether House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff should be arrested for \u201ctreason.\u201d And on Wednesday he called the House Democrats' investigation \u201cBULLS---\" in one tweet and a \"COUP\" in another.\n\n\u201cThe words of a president matter. Trump has again shown he is irresponsible and endangering others with his tweets. He should lose the privilege to be on Twitter,\u201d Harris wrote on Twitter on Monday.\n\nShe urged Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to take action.\n\nGabbard's comments weren't the first time she's disagreed with Harris.\n\nThe two candidates clashed in a viral moment at July\u2019s Democratic primary debate, when Gabbard took aim at the former California attorney general over her record as a prosecutor.\n\nAsked if her pushback against Harris\u2019 suggestion to suspend Trump from Twitter was personal, Gabbard quickly answered, \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know why anyone would think that.\u201d", "description": "Two of Sen.
