(It would go on to sell more than 12 million copies in the U.S. alone, according to statistics listed on the Recording Industry Association of America website.)\n\n'We're northern Ontarians'\n\nShania Twain is seen extending a hand to fans, as her limo drives through the streets of Timmins, Ont., on August 15, 1996. (The National/CBC Archives)\n\nHer many fans who attended Shania Twain Day put up with some bad weather, which they did willingly in hopes of catching a glimpse of the singer.\n\n\"She's the greatest country singer in the world!\" one rain-defying fan explained to CBC reporter Dan Bjarnason.\n\nThe weather wasn't perfect on Shania Twain day, but fans stuck it out to see the singer. 1:04\n\nTwain joked about her local fans' willingness to stand in the rain.\n\n\"We're tough \u2014 we're not made of sugar, right? We're northern Ontarians, we can deal with the weather!\" she said.\n\nA mother and her two daughters lucked out to land a photo with the singer on Shania Twain Day. (The National/CBC Archives)\n\nAnother fan drove hundreds of kilometres, with her two daughters in tow \u2014 both of whom wore matching, purple Shania Twain T-shirts.\n\n\"We're Shania Twain fans and my girls are very excited,\" she explained to Bjarnason. Fortunately, she and her daughters were among the lucky ones to get a photo with the singer.\n\nWithin a few days, Twain was due to sing at a birthday party for then-U.S. president Bill Clinton. Asked which one was a bigger deal, the songstress went with an answer sure to please her hometown.\n\n\"I have to say, emotionally, this is the bigger day,\" said Twain, whose own birthday also falls in August. \"This is more of a sentimental time for me. I mean, this morning, I practically cried my eyes out. It was everything I could do to keep myself together.\"", "description": "Shania Twain says she was \"treated like a queen,\" when honoured with a special day of recognition in her hometown.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4786111.1534347473!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/shania-twain-in-timmins-ont-in-august-of-1996.jpg"}
