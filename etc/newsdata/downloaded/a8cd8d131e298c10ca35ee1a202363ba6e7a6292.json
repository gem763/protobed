For this update, we took out a few of the sold-out pricier options, reached out to more experts, and updated this post with a couple more office-approved bags for under $250.\n\nThe best work bags are a little bit of everything at once: They\u2019re professional, but not too stuffy, roomy enough to juggle gym sneakers and a laptop, equipped with additional pockets to store the miscellany you don\u2019t need but carry anyway (reading material, kid\u2019s toys, and even the odd wine bottle), and not required, but still appreciated \u2014 able to be worn multiple ways. Below, we surveyed 18 industrious women on the multitasking tote bags, backpacks, and over-the-shoulder options they rely on to get them through the workday and beyond.\n\nBest wide tote bag\n\nMadewell Transport Tote \u201cI do not have very exciting or expensive tastes in handbags; I just need a bag with a handle drop length, so I can shove it over my shoulder while wearing a puffy jacket that holds a laptop, water bottle, and all the toys my kids swear they want to play with that I get stuck carrying home. So basically, I need a black garbage bag. I\u2019m on my second or third Madewell Transport Tote, but this most recent one, in pink (sorry, \u201cantique rose\u201d) \u2014 but, like, the perfect pink \u2014 is definitely helping offset the winter doldrums.\u201d \u2014Deb Perelman of Smitten Kitchen Editor\u2019s Note: This rose color is discontinued for now, but the bag is still available in a classic brown shade. It\u2019s also available in a dark cocoa and a blush-y neutral shade. $168 at Madewell Buy\n\nThe Day Market Tote \u201cWhen it comes to versatile work bags, I always prefer the simplest option. To avoid carrying multiples, I like a large leather tote \u2014 roomy enough to carry a change of clothes and sneakers, and versatile enough to take me from the gym to the office to any plans I have afterward. Everlane\u2019s Day Market Tote is all the right mix of things.\u201d \u2014Biz Lindsay, director of public relations at Outdoor Voices $175 at Everlane Buy\n\nBest medium-size tote bag\n\nMadewell Medium Leather Transport Tote \u201cAs a graphic designer, I have struggled to find a bag big enough to fit my laptop, iPad, and sketchbooks, along with all the other day-to-day necessities. All the other bags were either very large or not big enough, but Madewell\u2019s medium transport tote is quite literally the perfect medium. I love the carrying versatility of the bag because you can wear it over your shoulder with a longer strap or carry it by two handles for a different look. I am also a fan of the minimal interior \u2014 with only a single pocket, it is easy to find what you are looking for.\u201d \u2014Meagan Sapashe, graphic designer $158 at Madewell Buy\n\nBest long tote bag\n\nPhoto: Kabir Fernandez Baggu Basic Tote \u201cI love my Baggu tote because it\u2019s roomy enough for whatever I need, yet still small enough that I never feel I\u2019m carrying something more than a purse. It\u2019s like Mary Poppins\u2019s carpetbag. I use it for everything from carrying my gym stuff to groceries to going out for drinks. The thing that I love most is that the leather and finish age really well, so even oil stains and scratches give it beautiful character. It\u2019s low-maintenance, so versatile in its simplicity, and super cute.\u201d \u2014Sam Anderson, product designer Editor\u2019s Note: We own this Baggu tote for work, too, and love it. $132 at Baggu Buy\n\nBest zip-up tote bag\n\nCuyana Classic Leather Zipper Tote \u201cTwo years ago, I was waiting on the security line at the airport when the strap on my (admittedly overstuffed) Madewell Transport tote tore off. I ordered this Cuyana bag from my phone on the spot. I used the Transport tote for a few years and loved it, but this bag is a big upgrade. The pebbled leather doesn\u2019t show scratches or wear as easily, and the zipper top (and inside zip pocket) makes me feel more secure. It holds everything you\u2019d need for a work day, and the gold hardware adds some polish.\u201d \u2013 Karen Iorio Adelson, writer $195 at Cuyana Buy\n\nBest structured tote bag\n\nDagne Dover Legend Tote \u201cAs a working woman and a mother, I need a bag that is versatile enough to adapt to the needs of all my roles in life. Whether my bag needs to hold important documents or snacks for a soccer game, the Dagne Dover meets all my needs. If you open my bag you will find my DSLR, work folders, and supplies for my work life, snacks for my little one, and my travel coffee tumbler to keep me going. Best thing is, this bag has compartments to safely keep all these items.\u201d\u2014Jade Stenger, high-school assistant principal $265 at Dagne Dover Buy\n\nBest waterproof tote bag\n\nLongchamp Large Le Pliage Tote \u201cLiving in Seattle, with its damp weather, I use the Longchamp Large Le Pliage Tote. The carry-all bag repels water to protect all my important stuff, including my iPad, phone, wallet, makeup bag, and eyeglasses. The best thing about it is that it folds up into a little rectangle so I can pack it away as an extra personal item in my carry-on, making it a versatile travel bag, too.\u201d \u2014Elisa Yip, fashion designer and blogger $145 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nBest shopper bag\n\nJoseph & Stacey Shopper \u201cThis bag is my favorite everyday bag \u2013 fashionable yet functional. The turnlock adjustable strap makes it easy to convert from a tote to a shoulder or crossbody bag when I\u2019m on the go. Plus, it is the perfect size for holding everything I need, without being so large that I have to dig. Don\u2019t get me started on how minimalist and well-made it is, too. It\u2019s hands down the best handmade leather bag that screams luxury (but at an affordable price).\u201d \u2013 Vivid Wu, fashion stylist Editor\u2019s Note: This sand color is currently unavailable, but the bag is still available in rich black, deep foreast, and taupe. $380 at W Concept Buy\n\nEverlane Form Bag \u201cI bought this bag after my wallet was stolen out of my backpack at a Shake Shack. Post-theft, I vowed to take a break from backpacks. This one fits my laptop easily and the top part has four magnets so it automatically closes. It can fit even more if I\u2019m less concerned about my bag staying closed, including a notebook, a tupperware full of lunch and my laptop charger. It doesn\u2019t scuff easily and the strap is very comfortable, too.\u201d \u2013 Dana Balch, account supervisor at Ogilvy & Mather $235 at Everlane Buy\n\nNisolo Simone Crossbody Shopper And though this one wasn\u2019t explicitly called out by any experts, it\u2019s one that\u2019s caught the eye of our editors before: \u201cIt\u2019s crafted from sturdy vegetable tanned leather, it\u2019s distinctive but not so trendy that I\u2019m spotting it everywhere on my commute to work, and the structured body means it has limits. I\u2019ll have just enough room for a laptop and magazine without the temptation to bury my house keys under a pile of snacks and hand creams.\u201d $158 at Nisolo Buy\n\nBest work backpack\n\nMatt & Nat Fabi Faux Leather Backpack \u201cMy Fabi backpack from Matt & Nat is truly an essential part of my workday. This bag merges fashion and function in the most durable and innovative way possible. Ethically made and manufactured with sustainable resources, the bag features adjustable straps, expandable gussets, and pockets for laptops and smartphones. Not only is the bag multifunctional for work and play \u2014 it\u2019s a long-lasting investment.\u201d \u2014Libby Bartley, content strategist and branding stylist Editor\u2019s Note: This frappe color is currently unavailable, but the backpack is still available in chili matte nickel. $180 at Matt & Nat Buy\n\nLo & Sons Hanover Deluxe Travel Backpack \u201cMy go-to bag when I\u2019m working and traveling is the Lo & Sons Hanover Deluxe backpack. Is it beautiful? No, but when I\u2019m schlepping all my photo gear and my laptop, yet still want to be as portable as possible, it\u2019s the most practical option for me. The design is minimal enough and understated. The back of the backpack has a sleeve that slides over my luggage handles, which is a simple design godsend. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve had bags fall off my luggage in transit in the past.\u201d \u2014Alice Gao, photographer $148 at Lo & Sons Buy\n\nHaerfest Small Backpack $195 (was $225, now 13% off) \u201cI\u2019m a big backpack person, and this Haerfest backpack has become my go-to. One of my favorite features is its slightly hidden back panel, separate from the main compartment, with its own zipper. It\u2019s a convenient place to store my laptop, so I don\u2019t have to dig through all of my junk to get to it. But the Haerfest backpack also just looks and feels nice, sturdy yet sleek, and always comfortable to carry.\u201d \u2014Maxine Builder, writer $195 at Haerfest Buy\n\nBest gym bag for bringing to the office\n\nStudio 2 Bag \u201cCaraa\u2019s super-versatile \u2018luxury sports bags\u2019 are magical. My Studio 2 carries me through work, workouts, bagless grocery shopping, sneaking wine into movie theaters, and whatever else the week throws my way. It has a million secret pockets, adjustable straps that convert to a backpack or over-the-shoulder weekender, and a big, cushiony pouch for my laptop. Plus, it zips fully closed. (Why is that so hard to find??) Sorry to brag, but people stop me in the street to ask where I got it all the time.\u201d \u2014Katheryn Thayer, senior design and tech editor at Kickstarter $395 at Caraa Buy\n\nBest bucket bag\n\nBaggu Drawstring Bucket Bag \u201cI\u2019ve worn this bag almost every day: to work, on weekends, even to the occasional wedding, dressing it up and down. When circumstances demand \u2014 air travel, or an afterwork event that requires a change of shoes \u2014 I carry a large tote or a backpack, and I simply tuck the Baggu, essentials undisturbed, inside the bigger one. It always fits.\u201d \u2014Hannah Goldfield, writer $160 at Blancsom Buy\n\nParisa Wang Bucket Bag We\u2019re also a big fan of Parisa Wang\u2019s bags for the workplace, since they\u2019re very minimal, well-crafted, and don\u2019t have any over-the-top branding details. She just released a bag with Reformation, made from recycled leather, which is under $300 and doesn\u2019t require any straps: you can just sling it over your forearm. $355 at Shopbop Buy\n\nBest cross-body bag\n\nA.P.C. Demi-Lune Bag \u201cThis bag is over four years old and has been all over the world with me, but it\u2019s best known as my go-to spring and summer work bag. It has developed a natural patina, so it\u2019s quite dark and wears so well. I love it because I can fit my wallet, my rolled-down sweater, lip balm, and eye drops in it perfectly, and I can also wear it cross-body for when I need two hands.\u201d \u2014Michaella Kurdziel, senior director of people and experience operations at MM.LaFleur $382 at Farfetch Buy\n\nBest top-handle bag\n\nThe Business Bag \u201cI am obsessed with this Mlouye bag. I travel quite a bit for work, and it\u2019s very important to me that I pack light and bring one bag that does it all. And when I say does it all, I mean it\u2019s something that I can bring on flights, to my client meetings, and then, eventually, to dinner with my girlfriends, all in one (without looking uptight). Basically, a day-to-night bag, but fashion. I have a MacBook that fits in snugly, and it holds all my other knickknacks in what seems like 500 compartments. The look is fairly minimal, unlike the rest of my look, so it nicely balances out my outfits.\u201d \u2014Rachel Effendy, global head of social and strategy at Ralph Editor\u2019s Note: This light brown color is currently unavailable, but the bag is still available in taupe. $425 at Mlouye Buy\n\nBest satchel\n\nAngela Roi Eloise Satchel \u201cWho says vegan can\u2019t equal luxurious? This vegan-leather minimal bag is the perfect pairing for your everyday lady-boss get-up that\u2019ll easily transition from day to night. On top of elevating that pantsuit, the Eloise satchel is cruelty- and sweatshop-free.\u201d \u2014Christina Sewell, sustainable fashion consultant $245 at Angela Roi Buy\n\nHaerfest Agnes Satchel Crossbody \u201cThis satchel by minimalist brand Haerfest gives off serious Peggy Olson vibes. Form truly meets function with three separate inner compartments for your phone, keys, and wallet, along with a big outer sleeve for easy-to-grab necessities. It also features a tiny pocket that just happens to be the perfect size for a handful of business cards.\u201d \u2014Sidney O\u2019Reilly, writer and digital producer at Under the Influence Editor\u2019s Note: This black color is currently unavailable, but the satchel is still available in olive. $525 at Haerfest Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
