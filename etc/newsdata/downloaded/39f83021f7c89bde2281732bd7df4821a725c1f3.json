I\u2019ve seen it again and it\u2019s obvious to me.\n\n\u201cEven more, on the second penalty, Immobile put his foot in front of De Roon. That\u2019s not a penalty either.\n\n\u201cWe lost the Italian Cup final here (last season) on a similar incident.\u201d\n\nStar Atalanta striker Duvan Zapata was sidelined with an injury suffered on international duty with fellow Colombian Luis Muriel taking his place.\n\nThe forward bagged a first-half double as Lazio struggled initially in a rematch of last season\u2019s Italian Cup final which the Romans won.\n\nMuriel put the visitors ahead on 23 minutes when Robin Gosens played the Colombian in on goal.\n\nHe scored his second five minutes later from a free-kick, with Alejandro Gomez netting the third eight minutes before the break.\n\nBut the visitors lost momentum after the break.\n\nImmobile got one back for Lazio from the spot after being brought down by Jose Luis Palomino and then combined with Correa for their second.\n\nImmobile earned a late penalty after a Marten de Roon foul, celebrating wildly after converting to grab a dramatic point before Lazio\u2019s Europa League trip to Celtic next week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m losing years of my life kicking penalites in the 90th minute,\u201d said 29-year-old Immobile, after scoring his third league goal from the spot this season.\n\n\u201cThis result gives us confidence because coming back from three goals down gives an extra boost.\u201d", "description": "Milan (AFP) \u2013 Serie A leading scorer Ciro Immobile\u2019s late brace of penalties helped Lazio wipe out a three-goal deficit in a thrilling 3-3", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/7d9011_immobile-is-top-serie-scorer-season-goals-immobile-snatches-lazio-draw-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
