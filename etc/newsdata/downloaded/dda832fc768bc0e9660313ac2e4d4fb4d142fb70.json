When I was six years old, my father passed away. I vividly remember my mother used to have a booklet that recorded all insurance premium payments, so when my father passed away and the insurance company declined to pay, that stuck in my mind as she was very frustrated because I wanted to understand this animal called insurance,\u201d Vilakazi says.\n\nHe started his career at CWB Loss Adjusters insurance assessors as a trainee loss adjustor at a time when there were almost no black loss adjustors in the country.\n\n\u201cI started off working with the owner of the company as a trainee assessor and learnt a lot working directly under the boss. They were focusing on commercial and legal claims, but what I brought to the table was claims for homeowners and household contents, and I managed to get major state-owned clients via an underwriting company that was part of Zimisele.\u201d\n\nHe later joined Zimisele Underwriting Management Company as a portfolio manager, but left after being appointed the acting managing director five years later.\n\n\u201cWe grew Zimisele from R30 million to more than R250 million in turnover. So the vision was always to have that company be the first black-owned insurance company. When I left, I started an investment holding company with Maurice Radebe called Balisa Holdings,\u201d Vilakazi says.\n\nThree years later, Balisa boasted a portfolio worth more than R80 million across eight companies in various sectors and, with Vilakazi as the CEO, he sat on the boards of all eight entities.\n\n\u201cIt was getting too much because I was assisting all the companies with business development. So we parked the company [Balisa] without disinvesting and I joined Egoli Gas in 2009, which was one of the companies that we had already invested in and I had been on the board with since 2006,\u201d he says.\n\nHe later sold his shares in Balisa Holdings, but remains close to Radebe.\n\nAs managing director of Egoli Gas, Vilakazi expanded the business to drive its turnover from R230 million to more than R400 million in three years.\n\n\u201cWe just had to broaden the scope of the targeted clients and we ensured we got commercial clients rather than having 80 clients with 80 problems.\n\nAs managing director of Egoli Gas, Vilakazi expanded the business to drive its turnover from R230 million to more than R400 million in three years.\n\n\u201cWith commercial clients, it might be the same 80 challenges, but it\u2019s a single client,\u201d he says of his strategy to grow the company\u2019s turnover rather than just the client base.\n\nVilakazi\u2019s steering of Egoli Gas did not go unnoticed. Construction giant Stefanutti Stocks recruited him as the managing director of their then ailing housing division.\n\n\u201cI have never had to apply for a job in my life. I have always been approached. At Stefanutti Stocks, it was the same thing really. The mandate was to grow the business and ensure profitability,\u201d he says.\n\nHeading up the housing business of that company, he says, was a great experience, and he increased its turnover from about R250 million to more than R700 million.\n\n\u201cI stuck to the same principle of targeting bigger clients. That was one of my career highlights because I was more exposed to social housing.\u201d\n\nAt Stefanutti, his performance prompted the company to offer him a position to be part of the executive committee of the group and an understudy to the CEO.\n\nThe decision to take up the offer saw him relinquish his position as managing director of the housing division.\n\nThe CEO handover did not work out, and that was when he was approached by Enza Construction to join the company to establish Enza Housing in January last year.\n\n\u201cI have always been in a space where I either have to start something or grow something. When I started at Enza Housing, it was a natural progression because I have always been in infrastructure [development] in one way or another. Anything to do with structure and bricks and mortar, that\u2019s me,\u201d he says.\n\nVilakazi says starting the subsidiary proved to be challenging.\n\n\u201cGetting clients did not happen as quickly as anticipated. Another challenge was working capital, because you needed to feed this baby. Fortunately, the shareholders were patient. They stuck it out,\u201d Vilakazi says.\n\nThe company has now bagged some major social housing projects.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to grow for the sake of growing,\u201d Vilakazi says, emphasising that, in growing the company, he ensured that he was not overstretching the resources.\n\nHe also consolidated the client base.\n\nTaking time to understand an industry, Vilakazi says, is very important in any business, and this does not happen overnight.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to grow for the sake of growing,\u201d Vilakazi says, emphasising that, in growing the company, he ensured that he was not overstretching the resources. He also consolidated the client base.\n\n\u201cI normally talk about the first 90 days. When I go into a company or a sector, I will meet the top 20 clients, the top 20 suppliers, the stakeholders, staff, shareholders and the regulator within the first 90 days.\n\n\u201cThe intention is to immerse oneself in the industry and understand the expectations of the stakeholders. It is also important to be at the coalface so that when you expand, you know exactly what it takes, because being a managing director is about the people,\u201d Vilakazi says.\n\nThe keen reader of business publications and a family man, Vilakazi is also a deeply religious lay pastor and passionate business mentor.\n\nHe considers his former partner at Balisa Holdings and current vice-president of energy business at Sasol, Radebe, as his own mentor.", "description": "Bheki Vilakazi is passionate about growth, and that love has seen him earn a reputation as an expansion specialist in corporate construction circles.", "authors": ["Lesetja Malope"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9467/fa3648e6fa624a9ca90a225e6dafa751.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
