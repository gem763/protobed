Zombies: Battle For Neighborville Based On Tastiness", "language": "en", "text": "Plants Vs Zombies: Battle For Neighborville is filled with zombies and plants, as the name suggests. They fight each other for control of the world. Plants wanting to protect humans and zombies wanting to eat humans and their brains. Speaking of eating...\n\nI appreciate everything the plants have done for us humans, protecting us from deadly zombies and various zombie built machines. Very thankful. But I\u2019m also a human and I need to eat and many of these plants are edible. So I decided to rank each plant featured in Battle For Neighborville according to how tasty they are and if they are even edible at all.\n\nI\u2019m not raking the zombies because they aren\u2019t edible. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t eat a zombie. Would you? (I hope not.)\n\n10 - Oak & Acorn\n\nAccording to some quick research, acorns are not safe to eat raw. However, you can eat them if you prepare them properly. But I\u2019ve never eaten an acorn. Maybe they taste great? There is one guy who is trying to make acorns popular and someone else has created acorn crackers. They don\u2019t look very tasty.\n\nThe real reason Oak & Acorn are at number 10 on this list is because of the big oak tree. Players can switch between either during gameplay. Oak looks cool and is use useful in combat, but I wouldn\u2019t eat him. I doubt bark tastes very good. You could burn him and cook something on the flame, but beyond that, I don\u2019t think the oak tree belongs in cooking.\n\n9 - Chomper\n\nChomper is a fast-moving plant that can burrow underground and attack zombies from below like a shark. Chompers seems inspired by a Venus Fly Trap. So can you eat a Venus Fly Trap? Probably. Should you? No. You shouldn\u2019t. For one thing, they are endangered and might go extinct in the future. For another thing, according to someone on Quora, if you eat one it will grow inside you. Is that person just joking? Maybe... but do you want to risk it?\n\n8 - Snapdragons\n\nSnapdragons are a real plant, though they don\u2019t have dragon heads attached to them like in the game. They also don\u2019t breathe fire. Honestly, it seems like PVZ developers PopCap needs to do more research. As for edibility, Snapdragons are edible flowers. But according to the internet, they aren\u2019t very tasty compared to other edible flowers. But they also won\u2019t poison you, so that\u2019s a point in its favour.\n\n7 - Rose\n\nI had to ask for some help making this list. As has been documented on this very site, I\u2019m not the healthiest eater in the world. So I consulted my girlfriend and her experience eating stuff like roses! I didn\u2019t know people eat roses, but she has had roses in tea and liked the taste. I like tea, maybe I\u2019ll add some rosebuds to it next time.\n\n6 - Sunflower\n\nIn PVZ:BFN, Sunflowers are healers that provide plants with bits of the sun to help them stay alive during combat. Sunflower seeds are tasty and definitely edible, but I was surprised to learn that sunflowers are completely edible. Not just the seeds. Every part of a sunflower can be eaten and according to the internet, they taste nice as well.\n\n5 - Cactus\n\nThe cactus is one of my favourite plants to play as in PVZ:BFN. They are a fast-moving sniper with a very useful onion drone. (This is a weird game.) But in real life, I didn\u2019t love the taste of cactus. But I didn\u2019t hate it either. Furthermore, cactus seems really healthy and can potentially lower your cholesterol. Thanks, cactus! Not only are you a powerful sniper who protects humans, but when you die and get eaten by those humans, you help them fight cholesterol. What a hero!\n\n4 - Night Cap\n\nNight Cap might be one of the coolest plants in the new PVZ game. I never expected a mushroom to translate so perfectly into a fast-moving and stealthy ninja, but there you go. Loads of people eat mushrooms and depending on how they are cooked, I can enjoy some mushrooms too. However, I have no idea what kind of mushroom Night Cap is and so they might not be safe to eat. Considering in the game Night Cap can throw mysterious bubbles made out strange spores, I might skip eating it.\n\n3 - Peashooter\n\nPeas are totally fine. Maybe this is controversial to say, but I don\u2019t think peas are great. I\u2019ll eat them, sure, but I\u2019m not excited about peas. In a soup or part of a big meal, I\u2019ll chow down on some peas. But alone, I\u2019ll probably pass on peas. The Peashooter itself is technically edible, but according to my research would probably be too tough and stringy to enjoy.\n\n2 - Citron\n\nI grew up in Florida and developed a taste for Oranges back when I was very young. Orange juice is wonderful and one of my favourite drinks to have in the morning. So it should come as no surprise that Citron, a giant orange, makes it so high up on my list of edible PVZ plants. Oranges are super tasty and also can provide extra flavour to different deserts and meals. None of my oranges ever shoot lasers, but maybe I\u2019m just not buying the right oranges.\n\n1 - Kernel Corn\n\nCorn is good. Not a controversial opinion, I know. But corn is easily my favourite food on this list. It can be popped, creamed, cooked on a cob, frozen, made into bread or puffed. Plus Kernel Corn in the game is a great attacker who I use a lot. And let\u2019s be honest, that name is great and worth some bonus points.", "description": "Plants Vs Zombies: Battle For Neighborville is filled with zombies and plants, as the name suggests.
