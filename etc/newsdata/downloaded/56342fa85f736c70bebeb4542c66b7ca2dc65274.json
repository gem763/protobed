the ball and I saw at the last moment there would maybe be a small space on that side.\n\n\"I think it was the only way to win that point. I hit it well, but to hit that spot you need some luck.\"\n\nIt is a statistical quirk that Federer and Nadal, rivals across 15 years and 40 matches, have never met at the US Open.\n\nBut defending champion Novak Djokovic's exit has opened up the possibility of a box-office final between the pair.\n\nFederer faces Grigor Dimitrov, a player he has beaten seven times out of seven, in the last eight.\n\nNadal will take on Diego Schwartzman after sixth seed Alexander Zverev ran out of steam in his bid to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.\n\nThe 22-year-old had already played 14 sets in three matches before taking on Schwartzman in round four.\n\nHe took the first set but Argentinian Schwartzman hit back to win the next two.\n\nThere was controversy when Zverev was given a point penalty after an audible obscenity, giving Schwartzman a 5-2 lead in the fourth.\n\nUmpire James Keothavong had earlier issued a warning when Zverev smashed a ball away, but the German claimed he had not heard it.\n\n\"I mean, a code violation is fine. I didn't even argue that,\" he said. \"But neither of us heard me getting a warning in the first place.\n\n\"So it was like, OK, a warning is fine, it's no problem, but why am I getting a point penalty?\n\n\"He said he gave me a warning before. I didn't hear it. Diego didn't hear it. Most of the crowd didn't hear it.\n\n\"OK, it happened. It happened. It's fine. I think the umpires next time should let me know about it.\"\n\nMatteo Berrettini, the Italian 24th seed, roared through in straight sets against unseeded Andrey Rublev.\n\nRussian Rublev had previously beaten seeded players Stefanos Tsitsipas and Nick Kyrgios but he found Berrettini too strong, losing 6-1 6-4 7-6 (6).\n\nHe will play Frenchman Gael Monfils, who looks to be playing some of the best tennis of his flamboyant but injury-hit career this fortnight.\n\nMonfils beat Spain's Pablo Andujar 6-1 6-2 6-2.\n\nPA", "description": "Rafael Nadal came through his first stern examination at the US Open\u00a0to move a step closer to a maiden Flushing Meadows meeting with Roger Federer.
