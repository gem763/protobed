King has confirmed that the character is based on Charlie Howard, an out gay man murdered in King\u2019s home town of Bangor, Maine, in 1984 \u2013 who was targeted, in part, because he was wearing a flamboyant hat. By weaving the representation of an actual murder into his story, King suggests It\u2019s horror results from the license some think they have to perpetuate violence. The sequence in the film has proved controversial because some critics, such as Slate\u2019s Jeffrey Bloomer, consider it exploitative of Howard\u2019s murder. But that\u2019s the point. We\u2019re meant to be shocked by the attack. In the book it happens straight after the murder of a six-year-old, which starts the story\u2019s avenging narrative. As the film\u2019s star Jessica Chastain told Variety: \u201cWe can\u2019t pretend that it doesn\u2019t still exist because it\u2019s part of our every day\u201d. The murder was completely excised from the home-friendly television miniseries adaptation in 1990.\n\nThe question is personal for me: on the night in 2017 that I signed a contract to write a book about Stephen King\u2019s It, I was assaulted and left for dead for wearing a flamboyant hat \u2013 a trilby with feathers in it. The attackers asked me if I was queer.\n\nThe film\u2019s classification rating reveals how audiences are expected to respond to the material, especially with regard to the notional immature, impressionable viewer who may directly imitate the action or identify with the characters. In the UK, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has rated it as 15, citing its \u201cstrong gory violence, horror, language, discrimination\u201d, and places the onus on 15-year-olds to govern themselves. But, in truth, this is lopsided: the story contains hate speech aimed at (legally-protected) disability through to (as-yet unprotected) fatphobia, but the BBFC\u2019s guidance focuses only on homophobia: \u201cA young man is subjected to homophobic abuse (\u2018faggot\u2019) before being seriously beaten\u201d and \u201ca young boy being verbally abused in a similar manner.\u201d\n\nOne of the ratings body\u2019s main concerns is preventing copycat behaviour: the BBFC notes that, to get a 15 rating, \u201cthe work as a whole must not endorse discriminatory language or behaviour, although there may be racist, homophobic or other discriminatory themes and language\u201d. Accordingly, It Chapter Two\u2019s homophobic murder scene discourages discrimination by presenting Adrian and his partner, Don, as heroes. The happy couple are framed against the bright lights of a fairground sky, having given their winnings to a young girl with a facial birth mark. The changes from the book also reinforce this: while in the book, Adrian wears a hat with a flower in it and Don wears skin-tight trousers and lipstick, in the film Adrian\u2019s pink sweater is the only queer-coding. A gang verbally abuses them for talking about their planned future together and demands Adrian remove his novelty fairground hat. Rather than being cowed, film-Adrian (played by Xavier Dolan) delivers his beautifully-pitched Meg quip in a manner of which RuPaul would approve, but is punished for his spark when the assault begins.\n\nWhen Adrian resurfaces, his corpse flirts with Bill Hader\u2019s Richie, a fan-favourite character whose queerness is suggested by a close-up of a hand held a second too long to be \u201cjust friends\u201d. While this isn\u2019t the Richie of King\u2019s book, the film applauds him for overcoming his internalised homophobia in a happy ending where he recarves his and his first love\u2019s initials into Derry\u2019s \u201cKissing Bridge\u201d. The BBFC rating suggests mature children can understand that the film\u2019s queer portrayals condemn homophobia and promote self-determination.\n\nStephen King\u2019s It balances harsh depictions of realistic violence with the delights of unlikely friendships. King made this point by intertwining Charlie Howard with his fictitious counterparts; through the debate it has caused, the film has widened that dialogue. It has prompted discussions about empathy, and how to dismantle the hate and structural inequality that leads to discrimination in the first place. I was nervous of the sequence because of my own assault, but I\u2019m glad it was included. It validated my perception that the attackers were in the wrong and it gave me hope. By including Adrian, making him a hero and aligning him with Richie\u2019s acceptance of his own sexuality, this modern adaptation of It shows that the world is changing and there\u2019s everything to fight for: we can all be lovers in the end.", "description": "The murder of a gay man in It Chapter Two brings real-life horror into the latest Stephen King adaptation.
