Instead, he filed a lawsuit saying Trump\u2019s \u201cassertion of immunity against congressional process may override the House subpoena.\u201d Kupperman, the lawsuit said, \u201cis aware of no controlling judicial authority definitively establishing which branch\u2019s command should prevail.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd not so much as a footnote for Gore! What next \u2014 Republicans attempting to put impeachment in a lockbox?\n\nIf no controlling judicial authority has answered the question posed by Kupperman, that\u2019s because nobody has had the chutzpah to ask such a question before. Never before has there been such a blanket refusal by an administration to recognize any and all congressional investigative authority. If the Trump White House were to prevail in its argument that current and former advisers to the president are \u201cabsolutely immune\u201d from appearing before Congress for any reason, effective congressional oversight of any presidential administration would cease to exist.\n\nThe argument is likely a legal loser; Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell of the D.C. federal court last week smacked down a similarly expansive argument by the administration. But its danger is less as a legal argument than a stall technique: If the Trump administration can block senior administration officials from testifying by keeping the matter in the courts for months, they can dismiss the testimony given by lower-level officials as \u201chearsay\u201d as they try to outlast the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Democrats aren\u2019t about to idle their inquiry for months waiting for Kupperman\u2019s controlling judicial authority to weigh in. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who is leading the inquiry, emerged from the witness-free hearing room after Kupperman\u2019s no-show to say there may be contempt-of-Congress proceedings against Kupperman. \u201cWe are not willing to allow the White House to engage us in a lengthy game of rope-a-dope in the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nA few hours later, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi backed up that promise: She announced the House would vote Thursday formalizing the impeachment inquiry to \u201celiminate any doubt\u201d about the House\u2019s authority.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that the latest strategy will work better than previous defenses, which have quickly unraveled.\n\nAD\n\nFor the past couple of weeks, for example, the White House and Republicans proclaimed that Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, had testified that there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d between Trump and the Ukrainian president. But over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal quoted Sondland\u2019s lawyer saying Sondland had testified that he did indeed believe the arrangement was a quid pro quo.\n\nAD\n\nThe administration\u2019s sweeping claims of immunity from testimony, meanwhile, would be the end of decades in which successive administrations found accommodations with Congress. A tally by the progressive group Co-Equal found that over the past seven administrations, five chiefs of staff, nine white House counsels and six national security advisers were among 90 White House officials who testified before Congress regarding alleged misconduct or impropriety. National security officials testified on the Iran-Contra Affair, on presidential brother Billy Carter\u2019s business dealings, on the 9/11 attacks, on Benghazi and more.\n\nNone of those inquiries would have happened, very likely, if the Trump administration\u2019s claims had been the rule. And no inquiry into any president will happen in the future if they prevail now.\n\nAD\n\nYet congressional Republicans defend the administration\u2019s immunity from all. After Kupperman\u2019s no-show in the Capitol for his deposition Monday morning, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) came before the cameras to defend Kupperman\u2019s willingness to testify \u201cif the court rules against him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat undermined Kupperman, whose lawsuit claimed he merely sought a legal opinion and wasn\u2019t trying to evade testifying. Jordan quickly retracted his inadvertent admission.\n\nA few minutes later, Schiff said he warned Republicans about such support for the administration\u2019s defiance. \u201cThis will not be our last president,\u201d he reminded them.\n\nNo, but this may be the last of anything in U.S. government resembling a controlling legislative authority.\n\nInterested in following Dana Milbank\u2019s take on the impeachment inquiry?
