Zeldin: Impeachment Process Based on \u2018Cherry-Picked Leaks\u2019 to Mislead the American Public", "language": "en", "text": "Sunday on New York AM 970 radio\u2019s \u201cThe Cats Roundtable,\u201d Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) ripped House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and the impeachment process led by Schiff.\n\nZeldin said the impeachment inquiry had been a \u201cfly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants-type process\u201d for Schiff, adding House Democrats are using \u201ccherry-picked leaks\u201d from the whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president intended to mislead\n\n\u201cThis is not a process that started with a vote,\u201d Zeldin told host John Catsimatidis. \u201cThis process is one that is kind of a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants-type process for Adam Schiff, where there really aren\u2019t much rules. Subpoenas, I would argue, don\u2019t even have authority the way they are being issued. The minority does not have subpoena power. The president is not allowed to have his counsel present there to present evidence to cross-examine people who are coming to testify against him, unlike \u2026 prior precedent.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe Democrats should be providing the same rights to the president and House Republicans that they would demand if roles were reversed. And \u2026 something that I found outrageous is the cherry-picked leaks, the withholding of key facts, and the lying about other claims that\u2019s misleading the American public.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Sunday on New York AM 970 radio's \"The Cats Roundtable,\" Rep.
