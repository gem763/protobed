It's Ajax vs Chelsea in Amsterdam, inside a lovely stadium for the first ever Champions League clash between the two. Ajax may have lost Frenkie De Jong and Matthijs de Ligt in the summer, but they are flying high again this season and could cause real damage to Frank Lampard's European ambitions.\n\nChelsea are doing something similar to Ajax with their focus on youth academy graduates but clubs can only do this when those to emerge are good enough. Mason Mount, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Fikayo Tomori are absolutely of that quality. Ajax have Ballon d'Or nominee Dusan Tadic in their ranks this evening, supported by David Neres, Hakim Ziyech and another breakout star, Lisandro Martinez. He's more of a defensive midfielder and a replacement for Lasse Schone - who was the most underrated member of that team last season in my opinion - but has impressed so far since joining from Defensa y Justicia in Argentina. Me either.\n\nMan City and Spurs were seriously impressive last night and anything close to that performance by Chelsea would be good for English clubs in the Champions League but Ajax are a better team than Atalanta and Red Star and this should be a lot closer. Goals would be nice.", "description": "This looks nicer than my house.", "authors": ["Jj Bull", "Sam Dean", "Ipek Tugcu"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000213900381-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
