Mandatory Credit: Jeffrey Becker-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBoth teams are 2-1 and looking to keep up with a red-hot NFC North division that features all four teams above .500.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important,\u201d Cousins told reporters. \u201cWe understand that, but this is big boy football. Chicago knows that, too. We\u2019re not going to have any extra motivation that Chicago doesn\u2019t have. It\u2019s going to go in there with two heavyweights, and one\u2019s going to emerge with a victory.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, that team has been the Bears \u2014 at least when the game takes place at Soldier Field. The Vikings have lost 15 of their last 18 games in Chicago, including a 25-20 defeat a season ago.\n\nChicago will be on short rest after playing Monday night and posting a win over the Washington Redskins. The Bears relied on their typically dominant defense, which included a pick-six by veteran safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, as well as a rejuvenated offense that featured three touchdown passes from Mitchell Trubisky to Taylor Gabriel.\n\nTrubisky said he and his teammates still needed to clean up some mistakes before they face the Vikings.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would call it a breakthrough yet,\u201d Trubisky told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep getting better. Keep growing. Definitely room for improvement, and definitely in the second half, especially on my part. I think if we just stick to the process we\u2019re going to be all right.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re still improving as an offense and it\u2019s definitely awesome when you have your guys getting open. That\u2019s how you design it, that\u2019s why you practice, that\u2019s why you rep plays in the game. We have the playmakers to where if we get man to man, we\u2019re going to let them separate, do it on their own, and when we\u2019re (against) zone, they\u2019ve got to see that just like I\u2019m seeing it and find the open area. I think we\u2019re still growing and evolving as an offense.\u201d\n\nMore no-huddle plays could be in store for the Bears after they found success with that style in Week 3.\n\n\u201c(No huddle) just helps create a rhythm,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cIt helps us see the defense. It makes them get lined up faster so they don\u2019t know if we\u2019re checking or if we are running and going right away, so it kind of helps me see what they\u2019re doing. It makes them get lined up and kind of show their hand sometimes.\u201d\n\nCousins emphasized the need to play smart against the Bears defense. He has a dynamic playmaker in running back Dalvin Cook, the NFL\u2019s leading rusher, and a pair of dangerous receivers in Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs, but he does not want to take unnecessary chances against a defensive unit led by Khalil Mack and Leonard Floyd.\n\nIf pressure arrives in the pocket, Cousins will not try to force a risky play.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think it\u2019s just two hands on the football,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cNot only two hands, but really if you feel like you\u2019re in a crowd, no longer remain a passer and start to play for the sack. Sometimes a sack is OK if you feel like you\u2019re going down, and when you try to fight to get out of a sack, that\u2019s often times when the fumbles can happen.\u201d\n\nMinnesota is averaging 26 points per game and giving up 15.7 points per game.\n\nOn the opposite sideline, Chicago is averaging 16.7 points per game and allowing 13 points per game.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Kirk Cousins expects \"big-boy football\" when the Minnesota Vikings visit the Chicago Bears on Sunday afternoon.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1433990927&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P05D-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
