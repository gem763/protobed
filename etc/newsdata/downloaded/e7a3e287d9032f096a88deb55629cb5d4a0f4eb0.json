He planned to wave the bear during Trump\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my way of supporting Trump,\u201d White said, before explaining how Trumpy Bear\u2019s American flag cape can fold into a pouch on his back.\n\nWhite was one of an estimated several thousand Trump diehards who descended on a Fayetteville sports and entertainment complex Monday night to see the president rally his supporters.\n\nTrump was in Fayetteville to campaign for Dan Bishop, a special election candidate on the ballot Tuesday. It was a place he never should have been. The district is one that Trump won by 11 points in 2016 but has since become a toss-up as the president\u2019s numbers have softened. Bishop\u2019s Democratic opponent, Dan McCready, had appeared to narrowly lose his race for the seat in the ballot count last November to Republican Mark Harris, only to see the election overturned amid evidence of ballot tampering by Harris\u2019s campaign.\n\nFor such an occasion, the president tried his best to stay on message. The night, after all, was meant to keep Republicans from falling even further into the minority in the House. And during his roughly 90-minute speech, Trump mostly avoided the kinds of crowd jeers and racist attacks that have made headlines at earlier rallies. But despite the potential for embarrassing national fallout for Republicans if Bishop fails to keep the seat red, Trump couldn\u2019t help but veer off-message.\n\n\u201cI guess Dan\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t so good,\u201d he joked after an audience member fainted during Bishop\u2019s speech.\n\nThough the rally was about helping Bishop win the seat, the night felt more like a political carnival that brought Trump\u2019s cast of characters and adoring (teddy bear carrying) fans together. Among the entertainers were the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. and pro-Trump internet video stars Diamond & Silk. The two internet personalities, whose real names are Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, received wild cheers and shouts of \u201cwe love you!\u201d from the crowd when they walked through the event.\n\nBut not every Republican politician in attendance was greeted so warmly. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) took the stage after the national anthem and tried to warm up the crowd with a jab at quarterback Colin Kaepernick, whose civil rights protests were a frequent topic for rallygoers.\n\n\u201cAnybody take a knee?\u201d Tillis said. \u201cNot in this house!\u201d\n\nBut Tillis, who\u2019s facing a primary challenge after writing an op-ed earlier this year criticizing Trump\u2019s decision to redirect money from the military towards construction of the southern border wall, was greeted with a wave of boos. The Trump-crazed crowd even booed him a second time later on, when Trump introduced him.\n\nLike White, those in attendance had come not to help the Republican Party but to marvel in Trump and the F-U politics he preaches. And, for the most part, that\u2019s precisely what they did. Both Trump Jr. and some of the most passionate rallygoers reveled in \u201ctriggering\u201d liberals, wearing T-shirts that declared \u201cFuck your feelings\u201d or ones that dubbed Trump \u201csomeone with balls.\u201d\n\nSeventeen-year-old T-shirt vendor Jordan Conradson flew from Phoenix with his brother to sell shirts modeled on the Jack Daniels whiskey logo that promoted a mythical Trump drink made of \u201cliberal tears.\u201d Conradson said the $15 shirts were a hit.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve just been flying,\u201d Conradson said, who planned to sleep in his rental car that night rather than getting a hotel room to preserve his profits from the T-shirt sales.\n\nThe \u201ctriggering\u201d theme continued in Trump Jr.\u2019s warm-up speech. As he took the stage, Trump\u2019s eldest son kissed girlfriend, Trump campaign senior adviser, and former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, then asked the audience to note that Guilfoyle had consented.\n\n\u201cI will not be getting MeToo\u2019d this evening!\u201d Trump Jr., the author of an upcoming book decrying liberals called Triggered , said to laughter from the crowd.\n\nLater, Trump Jr. jokingly warned the crowd not to say that there are only two genders \u2014 prompting rally goers to repeatedly yell \u201cTwo!\u201d and hold up two fingers.\n\n\u201cYou guys are crazy!\u201d Trump Jr. said.\n\nLinda Barrera, from Charlotte, North Carolina, said she came to the rally \u201cto get my country back,\u201d and to bask in the camaraderie of fellow Trump supporters. She claimed that it\u2019s become difficult to openly support Trump.\n\n\u201cNow you might get eggs thrown at you,\u201d she said.\n\nSeveral rally goers said Trump was bringing the country back to a vague era of national greatness, in a reference to his 2016 campaign promise \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d In his speech, Trump portrayed his reelection campaign as the only thing stopping Democrats from attacking American institutions, with plans ranging from implementing socialism to the ban on incandescent light bulbs.\n\nGreensboro, N.C. tile specialist and diehard Ronald Reagan fan Anthony Castaldini said he had been feeling down about the state of American politics for nearly a decade before Trump ran for president. In the George W. Bush administration, as a protest against Bush\u2014whose name he still refuses to say\u2014he printed up a set of shirts with the Reagan\u2019s face on them, and began wearing them as a sort of homage.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do shit without Ronald Reagan,\u201d Castaldini told The Daily Beast.\n\nBut now there\u2019s another president winning Castaldini\u2019s admiration \u2014 and a spot on his custom shirts. Castaldini and his wife Elizabeth drove to the Trump rally, decked out in their handmade Trump gear.\n\nWith curly gray hair that touched his shoulders and an American flag bandanna wrapped around his forehead, Castaldini showed off his latest T-shirt design, this time with Trump added to it alongside Reagan. He\u2019s already worn it so many times, the lettering declaring that Trump is \u201csaving America\u201d faded away, forcing him to replace the printed-on message with paint.\n\n\u201cTo me, he\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Castaldini said. \u201cHe\u2019s bringing us back to the Reagan days.\u201d", "description": "The president is the head of the GOP.
