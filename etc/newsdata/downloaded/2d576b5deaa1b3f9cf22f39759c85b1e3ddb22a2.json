On Sept. 12, 2026, they will meet in East Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nUConn is currently coached by Randy Edsall, who spent most of five seasons coaching the Terrapins from 2011 to 2015. Coincidentally, when Maryland fired Edsall during the 2015 campaign, Mike Locksley took over as interim coach. Locksley now coaches Maryland full time.\n\nUConn is about to transition into a football independent starting in 2020, as the Huskies leave the American Athletic Conference to rejoin the Big East in all other sports. The Big East does not sponsor football. But five years from now when the series begins, UConn football may have found a new home.\n\nMaryland is 2-1 all-time against UConn.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
