Fort Worth's Police Shooting of Atatiana Jefferson Strengthens Community Distrust", "language": "en", "text": "Following the fatal shooting of a black woman in her home by a white officer in Fort Worth, Texas, over the weekend, community members say they have little faith in the role of law enforcement in the city.\n\nAtatiana Jefferson, 28, was in her home in the early morning hours of Oct. 12 when officer Aaron Dean shot and killed her through a bedroom window. She had been playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew, who witnessed the shooting. A neighbor had called the police for a wellness check after seeing Brown\u2019s front door open and lights on.\n\nDean was placed on administrative leave after the shooting. He resigned on Oct. 14 and was arrested for murder on the same day. Office Dean was released on Tuesday after posting a $200,000 bond.\n\n\u201cThis incident has eroded the trust we built with our community, and we must now work even harder to ensure that trust is restored,\u201d Fort Worth Police Chief Ed Kraus said at a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nCommunity members and activists argue that their trust of the police department has been eroding for a long time \u2014 with Jefferson\u2019s killing serving as a flashpoint \u2014 and they are highly skeptical of the role the police play in the Fort Worth\u2019s minority neighborhoods. They say that the police are not trusted by many locals, and are not held accountable for actions that disenfranchise the community they are intended to protect and serve.\n\n\u201cThe police department has no credibility in our community,\u201d Dr. Michael Bell, senior pastor at Greater St. Stephen First Church in Fort Worth, tells TIME. \u201cIt sounds surreal but this is the state of affairs.\u201d Dr. Bell is part of a coalition called Emancipate Fort Worth, a collective of community leaders and organizations who fight for equality and justice in the Fort Worth area.\n\nFort Worth is a majority minority city. Nearly 35% of residents are Hispanic and nearly 20% are black, while about 40% are non-Hispanic white, according to 2017 data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\u201cThe mayor and the city manager need to change the murderous culture of the police department,\u201d Dr. Bell says.\n\nAmber Carr, center, wipes a tear as her sister, Ashley Carr, left, and attorney Lee Merritt, right, listen to Amber and Ashley's brother Adarius Carr talk about their sister Atatiana Jefferson during a news conference, Monday, Oct. 14, 2019, in downtown Dallas. | Irwin Thompson\u2014AP More\n\nDeborah Peoples, chair of the local Democratic Party in Tarrant County, says that the city\u2019s leadership has failed to make changes to address issues with the police.\n\n\u201cWe hear parents say this all the time: \u2018I fear for my children every time they go out.\u2019 We have to change this systemic practice of marginalizing communities of color,\u201d Peoples tells TIME.\n\nIn 2019, at least five other people have been fatally shot by police officers in Fort Worth, according to the Texas Attorney General\u2019s office.\n\nThree of the deceased were African American males aged 20 or under. One incident occurred in circumstances related to a traffic stop and execution of a warrant, according to police reports.\n\nAnother person has been injured as a result of an officer shooting. In 2018, there were at least eight officer-involved shootings in Fort Worth.\n\nDistrust in police has reached the point where many community members feel that minorities should not call the police at all.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if we can survive a 911 call in Fort Worth,\u201d Dr. Bell says. He is working with others to come up with a help line for people to call in emergency and non-emergency situations, as opposed to calling 911 or 311. The Fort Worth Police Department did not respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment on Bell\u2019s proposal.", "description": "People in the community say they have little faith in law enforcement", "authors": ["Josiah Bates"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Aj007p99qOZXlXe2RpeNkw--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTA4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/15c5beaa336ebb37951dda8dbcee60dc", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
