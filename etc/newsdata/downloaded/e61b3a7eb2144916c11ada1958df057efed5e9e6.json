But when he decided to turn his focus on you, it was as if the sun came out. His smile and his gaze warmed you and made you feel like the most special person in the world.

In fact, when we first met , he reveled in his nickname \u201cthe Master of Doom\u201d. But in my universe, it was where he rose and where he set that was the point to which I oriented myself. Like a plant, I tilted my head to catch his rays.\n\n\u201cOur separation didn\u2019t alter this one bit. He was rising and setting and I planned my life around it as one does a day: depending on the position of the sun in the sky: you\u2019ll have breakfast or go to work or dinner with your friends. His death is the end of my world as I knew it.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Porizkova recalled her final moments with Ocasek, who died on Sept. 15 in his New York City home, to Rolling Stone. The cover girl told the outlet she was the one to find Ocasek had died in his sleep.

Except he was really, really still and his eyes were a little bit open. I thought he was waking up, actually. I was about to wave my hand in front of his face and go, \u2018Hey, I brought you coffee.\u2019 But I touched his cheek and it was like touching marble. That was pretty f---ing awful.\"\n\nThe mom-of-two said she held off calling 911 at the advice of Ocasek's manager, who said they would be bombarded by the press as soon as that happened.\n\n\"I wanted Ric\u2019s sons to get here so we could all say goodbye to him. So we waited, and we got to circle the bed and hold hands and really say goodbye,\" she said. \"We were here with his shape for many hours after his death. It was kind of wonderful because we all understood he was gone. He definitely left us.\"\n\nGEORGE MICHAEL\u2019S WHAM!
