All Rights Reserved.\n\nAlfonso Gomez-Rejon\u2019s Thomas Edison drama The Current War opens this week as The Current War: The Director\u2019s Cut, which is odd since the U.S. has never seen a \u201ctheatrical cut.\u201d There was one, but it largely played festivals. I saw it in September 2017 at the Toronto International Film Festival, where it was talked up as that year\u2019s awards-bait release for The Weinstein Company. A month later, it looked as if it would be a casualty of Harvey\u2019s disgrace, its \u201cW\u201d a scarlet letter.\n\nTwo years later, the association has dimmed, the film reshaped, semi-retitled, and owned by another company. (Harvey is now uncredited.) I don\u2019t know exactly how much was altered, but it did seem trimmer and easier to follow. I liked it a little more, but my response is much the same. That said, I\u2019ve slightly rewritten the review, polishing some lines and expanding a point or two. I\u2019d like to say I eliminated all references to Weinstein but I actually didn\u2019t mention him the first time around. On the whole, though, this is my preferred cut.\n\nThe problem with kids today \u2014 or kids any day, or most grown ups most days \u2014 is that they don\u2019t know how difficult it was for someone to invent the things they now can\u2019t do without. That\u2019s why biopics were invented: to give credit where it\u2019s due and also to help big stars win Oscars between superhero movies. The Current War is a quasi-biopic, insofar as it has two (three if you squint) subjects and its focus is unusually pointy-headed. It chronicles the struggle of the prickly celebrity inventor Thomas Edison (Benedict Cumberbatch) and the civic-minded capitalist George Westinghouse (Michael Shannon) over the electricity delivery system that will light and power the world. Edison favored DC (direct current), while Westinghhouse was committed to the cheaper, more efficient, but more perilous AC (alternating current). A champion of AC, the Serbian-American Nikola Tesla (Nicholas Hoult) would leave Edison\u2019s employ and ally himself \u2014 briefly \u2014 with Westinghouse.\n\nCompeting electrical currents don\u2019t scream \u201ccinema\u201d the way, for example, racecars do, although someone like Aaron Sorkin might have used flashy animation to show what\u2019s happening inside those wires and thereby bring the science to life. That would have helped here \u2014 it would have made the AC vs. DC fight less abstract. Instead, the director, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, has created visual interest by shooting the movie from a rowboat. Not literally, but that\u2019s how it feels. First, the camera (with a fishbowl lens) tips to the left so that Cumberbatch\u2019s Edison stretches up and into the center. Then, it tips to the right to show who he\u2019s talking to. Then, it jumps back to Edison, a little lower in the frame, sinking, bobbing. Is Gomez-Rejon trying to simulate an alternating current? Is he trying to evoke the inner life of the man said to have \u201cengineered his own reality?\u201d Or does he just like playing with his camera?\n\nThe problem with Gomez-Rejon\u2019s whooshy pyrotechnics \u2014 the dazzling computer-generated imagery, the camera that floats over picturesque city squares or arcs around speeding trains \u2014 is that the movie\u2019s form and content seem only nodding acquaintances. All this \u201ccinema magic\u201d has been put in the service of depicting a world just prior to its transformation by electricity. It\u2019s as if Gomez-Rejon is getting ahead of his own story, which is of men trying to make light bulbs work. The movie does look gorgeous. Given all the CGI it has surprising texture. The chiaroscuro frames are full of whirling gizmos, along with men in heavy dark coats and mutton chops. (This must have been the itchiest era in which to be a wealthy American.)\n\nYou\u2019d assume that Thomas Edison would be the hero of any movie he\u2019s in, but the screenwriter, Michael Mitnick, has a deeply conflicted view of the man who would co-invent motion-picture tech. That\u2019s admirable, because he never reduces Edison to a biopic clich\u00e9. It\u2019s also frustrating, because the director\u2019s romantic, gee-whiz style leads you to expect more dramatic clarity. (Form, meet content. Content, meet form.) Westinghouse is actually the movie\u2019s good guy. At the outset, he wants to join forces with Edison, but Edison coldly blows him off, leaving Westinghouse and his wife, Marguerite (Katherine Waterston), waiting on the platform while Edison\u2019s train (or a CG simulation thereof) zooms by. Edison already has a patron in J.P. Morgan (played by the astounding chameleon Matthew Macfadyen of Succession, here with a cherry nose) and furthermore has no use for Westinghouse\u2019s AC. Why won\u2019t Edison give AC a chance? It\u2019s unclear. Maybe only because he didn\u2019t think of it first. He\u2019s driven to demonstrate AC\u2019s lethalness by inviting the press to watch him use it to execute large animals (though the movie stops before the most famous execution, of the Coney Island elephant whose demise would be the first known snuff film).\n\nWe want to like Edison. He loves his wife (Tuppence Middleton) and kids fiercely. He\u2019s played by the star, Cumberbatch, whose alien-sea-reptile visage has moved the boundary posts of handsome. But charismatic as he is, the actor has a nagging flaw: His American accent is shaky, his vowels hitting icebergs in diction in the mid-Atlantic. He\u2019s a little opaque. Shannon, in contrast, is a hoary, likable Westinghouse, radiating as much decency as a man that wealthy is ever likely to and blessed with a wife who\u2019s his equal in character and intellect. As the Chicago World\u2019s Fair \u2014 with its unparalleled opportunity to introduce electric light and power \u2014 approaches, Westinghouse\u2019s chief deficit is that he\u2019s not the center of the movie. He\u2019s a businessman, not a visionary. Hoult\u2019s Tesla seems peripheral, an afterthought, and the movie\u2019s fourth star \u2014 Tom Holland, as Edison\u2019s assistant, Samuel Insull \u2014 gets his big scene too late for his character to register fully.\n\nThe Current War: The Director\u2019s Cut is visually lucid but thematically scattershot. Alternating current might be a fine principle for lighting the world, but movies require a current that\u2019s more direct.", "description": "Absorbing performances from Benedict Cumberbatch, Michael Shannon, Katherine Waterston and Nicolas Hoult can\u2019t quite make \u201cThe Current War\u201d work.", "authors": ["David Edelstein"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/09/08/tiff-stills/08-current-war.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
