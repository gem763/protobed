Apple has officially broken up iTunes to make way for three new apps - Podcasts, TV and Music. With the launch of macOS Catalina, Mac devices will come with separate apps for consuming podcasts, streaming music and playing videos. Apple is effectively 'replacing' iTunes with the three separate apps, the firm said. The new apps have 'all the features you'd expect from iTunes, all while being blazingly fast.' The Music, Podcasts and TV apps feature a streamlined design, with fewer tabs and a cleaner user interface. With the Music app, users have access to over 50 million songs, playlists and music videos. With the launch of macOS Catalina, Mac devices will come with separate apps for consuming podcasts, streaming music and playing videos, effectively replacing iTunes 'And users will have access to their entire music library, whether they downloaded the songs, purchased them or ripped them from a CD,' Apple said. 'For those who like to own their music, the iTunes Music Store is just a click away.' The Apple TV app for Mac packs many of the same features users would expect, like TV channels, personalized recommendations and more than 100,000 iTunes movies and shows. Macs also have access to the Podcasts app, with more than 700,000 shows to choose from, curated content and more. As the new trio of apps is replacing iTunes, many have been reflecting on the media software's legacy at Apple.

Over the ensuing years, it became many users' primary platform listening to music and, after the launch of the iTunes Music Store, buying music. It predated the launch of the iPod, which would come to revolutionize how people listen to music on the go. iTunes is also widely regarded as one of the primary motivators behind Apple's increasing focus on services, with the firm launching audiobooks support, then support for TV shows, podcasts and movies not long after. Despite iTunes' lasting impression on Apple, it had become largely irrelevant as users moved to iOS apps like Apple Music, Apple TV and others.\n\nThe Apple TV app for Mac packs many of the same features users would expect, like TV channels, personalized recommendations and more than 100,000 iTunes movies and shows.\n\nMacs also have access to the Podcasts app, with more than 700,000 shows to choose from, curated content and more.\n\nAs the new trio of apps is replacing iTunes, many have been reflecting on the media software's legacy at Apple.\n\nAnd with the Podcasts app, users can 'easily search' for actors or topics.\n\nThe shift makes way for a new way of housing media, although iTunes has been part of our lives for the past 16 years.\n\nSteve Jobs took the stage at the Macworld Expo in 2001 proclaiming \u2018There is a music revolution happening right now\u2019 and unveiled iTunes to the public for the first time.\n\nIn less than a year, Apple introduced the world to the iPod.\n\nBy 2002 there were just some 200,000 songs available on iTunes, but the services sold one million songs in its first week.\n\nIn the same year, a million iPods had been sold, and the world was soon rocking to their personal soundtracks while wearing the signature white earbuds.", "description": "Say goodbye to iTunes and hello to a new trio of apps.
