Maddison has been identified as a player that fits the ball for the Norwegian.\n\nAccording to The Athletic's David Ornstein, club chiefs at the King Power Stadium are said to be keen to tie the midfielder down to a new deal in order to protect the value of an asset garnering increased attention by multiple clubs.\n\nLeicester are looking to extend James Maddison's contract to increase his transfer value\n\nManchester United have been heavily linked with a move for the 22-year-old midfielder\n\nManchester United may be rivalled by Premier League foes Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur to obtain the signature of the Englishmen. League champions Manchester City, however, aren't interested in signing the player.\n\nMixed signals are coming out of both camps regarding the future of the Leicester man. Some believe Maddison will be a United player by next summer, while others feel Leicester will let their player go at some point during his extended deal.\n\nSolskjaer has striven to bring in more players that fit what he views as the 'United mould'. Summer signings Harry Maguire, Dan James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka have all been earmarked as players to build the future team around, with the characteristics of young, hungry and British being demanded by Solskjaer.\n\nUnited could face competition from Liverpool and Spurs for Maddison's signature though\n\nMaddison is said to be happy and gets on well with his team-mates and Brendan Rodgers\n\nHowever, should Spurs and Liverpool join the race for Maddison, United may face a struggle to land their man. The draw of Champions League football, which will certainly be offered by the latter club, may be decisive in where the Englishman plays next.\n\nMaddison is said to be happy at Leicester and gets on well with his team-mates and manager Brendan Rodgers.\n\nUnited will hope their previous good working relationship with Leicester can give them an advantage in signing Maddison. Chief Executive Ed Woodward struck a deal with the east Midlands club in the summer for defender Harry Maguire and will go back again for the midfielder.", "description": "Leicester are said to be preparing a new contract offer for star man James Maddison in an attempt to drive up his market price amid increased interest from Manchester United for their star man.", "authors": ["Ollie Lewis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/23/20011268-0-image-a-56_1571697991591.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
