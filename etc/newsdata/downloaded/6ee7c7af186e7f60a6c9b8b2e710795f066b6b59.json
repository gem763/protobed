In fact, he\u2019s made it a centerpiece of his campaign rallies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe find it sickening when it happens at his rallies,\u201d Ms. Brzezinski added. \u201cI find it kind of sickening to watch people leering at the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s sickening,\u201d Mr. Scarborough continued. \u201cWe are Americans, and we do not do that. We do not want the world hearing us chant, \u2018Lock him up,\u2019 to this president or to any president. Let\u2019s hope, as we move forward, maybe this is one less fascist tactic he and his supporters use during chants \u2014 that you are going to actually imprison your political opponent. So, let\u2019s leave that behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope he gets it,\u201d Ms. Brzezinski added.\n\nThe hosts\u2019 comments sparked a wave of criticism and the hashtag #SorryJoe in defense of the protesters at Sunday\u2019s game.\n\nMy Two Cents: We all agree the Presidency used to be an INSTITUTION. No longer. Donald Trump has defiled the office. Citizens are responding to who they see occupying the office. #LockHimUp is fair game for one who is so untruthful, racist, unstable & likely criminal. #SorryJoe \u2014 Sophia A.

Dissent is the most American thing there is \u2014 and to get clean, we need as much as there is on display. https://t.co/hmp4JHr8nD \u2014 David Simon (@AoDespair) October 28, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
