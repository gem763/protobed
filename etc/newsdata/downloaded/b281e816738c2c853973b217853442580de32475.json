We can fight back by telling our stories,\u201d she wrote Tuesday on Twitter, days after questions about that claim surfaced.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe quick backstory: A reporter for the socialist Jacobin magazine raised the specter of doubt about Warren\u2019s claims in a tweet last week. Then on Monday, the conservative Washington Free Beacon reported that documents show that the school board in New Jersey where Warren worked had approved a second-year teaching contract for her, thus supposedly contradicting her claims that she was asked not to return to teaching because of her pregnancy. Political adversaries have circulated a newly surfaced video of Warren saying she left public school teaching after taking a few graduate school courses and determining that teaching was not \u201cgoing to work out\u201d for her.\n\nConservatives on outlets such as Fox News have compared the inconsistency to Warren\u2019s past claims that she had Native American ancestry, which eventually led to her apologizing last year to multiple tribes after recognizing that they determine their membership, not DNA tests.\n\nHowever, the attention critics are paying to this story has led some people to view it as an attempt to smear the leading woman in the 2020 campaign in ways that seem similar to the conservative media\u2019s coverage of Hillary Clinton in 2016. For them, not only is Warren\u2019s story to be believed but so are all of the other stories from women about a workplace discrimination issue that has gotten too little attention: employment insecurity for expectant mothers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJoshua Zeitz, a historian and author, wrote a thread of tweets describing a long history of discrimination against pregnant women across multiple industries, leading to the need for legislation to address the issue.\n\n\u201cTo believe Warren is lying, one need be blind to the history of discrimination in \u2018pink collar\u2019 professions like teaching where pregnancy was a fireable offense, so much so that Congress passed Title VII in 1978 to outlaw the practice of dismissing pregnant professionals,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cTeachers arguably had it good: in some professions \u2014 notably, flight attendants \u2014 airlines imposed strict age caps and prohibited married women from holding their jobs. These practices persisted into the 1960s and 1970s.\u201d\n\nThe type of discrimination Warren claims she experienced in the 1970s existed across socioeconomic classes, although it manifested in different ways, said Joan C. Williams, founding director of the Center for WorkLife Law, an advocacy organization at the University of California Hastings College of the Law that focuses on gender equity issues in the workplace.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAmong low-wage women, the classic form of discrimination based on family responsibility was that a woman tells her boss she\u2019s pregnant and the woman is fired 15 minutes later,\u201d Williams said. \u201cFor white-collar women, the classic form of discrimination is not typically just for getting pregnant. The problems they encountered typically are triggered after they come back to work \u2014 promotions are stalled.\"\n\nPerhaps most notable is how differently pregnant mothers are treated from fathers. In 2014, Michelle Budig, a sociology professor at the University of Massachusetts, wrote \u201cThe Fatherhood Bonus and the Motherhood Penalty: Parenthood and the Gender Gap in Pay,\u201d a paper about how women are discriminated against in the workplace when they become mothers. Budig argues that the wage gap between men and women exists in part because women are discriminated against when they enter parenthood.\n\n\u201cWhile the average penalty for all women in the full model is about 4% per child, the penalty ranges in size from 6% per child among low-wage workers to no penalty among the earners at the 90th percentile or above,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMight employer discrimination lie behind the motherhood penalty that is unexplained by measurable characteristics of workers and jobs?\u201d Budig wrote. \u201cIt is difficult to obtain data on discrimination. However, evidence from experimental and audit studies support arguments of employer discrimination against mothers in callbacks for job applications, hiring decisions, wage offers, and promotions.\u201d\n\nA Harvard Kennedy School study found the recommended starting salary for mothers was 8.6 percent lower than the recommended salary for fathers. Williams suggested that women are financially punished when they become parents, unlike fathers, who are celebrated.\n\n\u201cBeing a father actually enhances a man\u2019s career prospects while it sharply hurts women,\u201d she told The Fix. \u201cAnd for single women, they often trigger the modern pathetic-spinster stereotype \u2014 someone who is lacking and not quite whole because they haven\u2019t fulfilled the biological destiny of women.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere has been significant improvement since the 1970s due to legislation such as the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 and data revealing just how different the experiences of pregnant women are in the workplace, Williams said. However, some companies have found less direct ways to treat pregnant women differently. Her center produced a report titled \u201cPoor, Pregnant, and Fired: Caregiver Discrimination Against Low-Wage Workers,\u201d sharing the experiences of working women.\n\n\u201cThe discrimination is a lot less open than it was,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt has not disappeared, and it will not disappear until we stop defining the ideal worker as someone who takes no time off for child-rearing and childbearing.\u201d\n\nif you don't understand what this furor over the Elizabeth Warren pregnancy firing story is about, ask pretty much any woman in your life over 35. \u2014 Anne Helen Petersen (@annehelen) October 8, 2019\n\nFor many women following the issue, Warren\u2019s experience reminds them of their own stories and the ways the issue persists.\n\nAD", "description": "Women see a refusal to believe women in Elizabeth Warren's pregnancy story.", "authors": ["Eugene Scott", "Reporter Covering Identity Politics For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KpaEUAUwu9CnBC9xR4ybgSYxxaA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S35EONHHBQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
