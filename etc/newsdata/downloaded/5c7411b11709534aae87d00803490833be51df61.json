Harry Dunn, 19, was riding his motorbike to visit his father when he was killed in the collision.\n\nThe chief constable of Northamptonshire, Nick Adderley, says he wrote to the U.S. Embassy in London, urging officials to waive the woman's diplomatic immunity so that she can be compelled to return to face a possible arrest and formal interview with police.\n\nPolice believe Sacoolas had just driven out of Royal Air Force base Croughton and was driving on the wrong side of the road when she struck Dunn, Sky News reports. RAF Croughton is home to a U.S. Air Force communications base.\n\nThe State Department said in an emailed statement to NPR on Monday that questions about waiving immunity for its diplomats and their family members overseas \"are considered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry; immunity is rarely waived.\" The statement did not identify the driver out of \"privacy and security concerns.\"\n\nThe family expressed dismay that Sacoolas was able to leave the country. \"All we need to do is to ask her to come back,\" Charlotte Charles, the victim's mother, said in an interview with Sky News. \"It's not much to ask. She's left a family in complete ruin. We're broken, inside and out. ... We're just utterly shocked and appalled that somebody is allowed to get on a plane and go home and avoid our justice system.\"\n\n\"We can't grieve for him at the minute because we don't know where we're going,\" the victim's father Tim Dunn, told the BBC.\n\nMP for South Northamptonshire Andrea Leadson said the event appears to have been an accident, and she appealed to Sacoolas directly: \"It needs a police investigation, but surely she must see that this family needs closure.\"", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he hopes the woman will return to face justice.
