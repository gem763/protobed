Pamela has to sleep in another bed.\u201d\n\nAdmitting he is concerned he has \u201cbecome a pain in the arse\u201d, he credited his wife of 30 years for plumping his pillows for him every night.\n\n\u201cSo far, she has never tutted,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd she\u2019s a rather attractive nurse.\u201d\n\nBilly, 76, said he has \u201cgood days and bad days\u201d, recounting: \u201cOne day my hearing went, then my balance went, my sight got worse.\n\n\u201cIt feels as if everything is being taken away from you and you watch it go.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe revealed that he struggles to perform tasks like putting money into his wallet but said his illness \u201cbrings out the best\u201d in others who show kindness when he needs help.\n\nIf you say, \u2018I can\u2019t get up, could you please help me out of my chair please?\u2019 no one ever says, \u2018Why?\u2019 They just do it. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I live this magical life.\u201d\n\nBilly, who was diagnosed with the degenerative neurological illness in 2013, takes daily edication to slow the effects.\n\nHe and wife Pamela, 69, live in Florida and during his interview with the Observer Billy described himself as being \u201ccontent\u201d.\n\nHe manages to pull out of dark moments by telling himself: \u201cBilly, you are 76 years old, how the f*** did you imagine you were going to feel?\u201d", "description": "The comedian is 'laughing and singing or having fights' in his sleep", "authors": ["Ashleigh Rainbird", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20525886.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_The-Moet-British-Independent-Film-Awards-Inside-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
