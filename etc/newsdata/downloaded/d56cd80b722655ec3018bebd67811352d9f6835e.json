REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Former U.S. basketball star Dennis Rodman, one of a handful of Westerners to have met North Korean head of state Kim Jong Un, and a friend of U.S. President Donald Trump, said on Monday he thought the two leaders could work out a deal.\n\n\u201cI think that it could still work. I just think that we need to stay on the right path to make it work,\u201d said Rodman, who was at the June 2018 Singapore summit between Kim and Trump - the first between leaders of the two states who have been technically at war since the of the Korean War in 1953.\n\n\u201cSo, I think that people should not give up on the U.S. trying to engage with North Korea in a good, safe manner,\u201d Rodman told Reuters television in an interview.\n\nNorth Korea said on Monday it was willing to restart nuclear talks with the United States in late September, but warned that chances of a deal could end unless Washington takes a fresh approach.\n\n\u201cI think Kim Jong Un wants peace. I know him very well, I think he wants peace. I think ... people don\u2019t realize that he wants to move on into the 21st century. I think he doesn\u2019t want to give up his country. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I think, you know, everything else is in the way,\u201d he said of the stalemated talks that would have North Korea dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions that have crippled its economy.\n\nRodman said Trump put him on his reality show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d years ago \u201cto help and guide me ... because I was out there being buck wild, doing my thing, having a good time. That\u2019s his way of showing that he cares about me.\u201d\n\nRodman\u2019s earlier visits to North Korea included a basketball game he organised, an event chronicled in the documentary film \u201cBig Bang in Pyongyang,\u201d which featured Rodman singing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to Kim, as well as scenes of inebriated and erratic behaviour by the basketball Hall of Famer.\n\nAsked if he has Kim\u2019s and Trump\u2019s numbers in his dated phone, Rodman replied: \u201cYou think people have a number in this damn phone? A flip phone? Really?\u201d", "description": "Former U.S. basketball star Dennis Rodman, one of a handful of Westerners to have met North Korean head of state Kim Jong Un, and a friend of U.S. President Donald Trump, said on Monday he thought the two leaders could work out a deal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428135989&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF89017", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
