But on Saturday night, the linchpin broke.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Aaron C. Davis and John Hudson reported that a person close to Sondland says the ambassador will tell Congress in a deposition this week that there was some kind of a quid pro quo, \u201cbut not a corrupt one.\u201d\n\nSondland will also indicate that he was merely relaying Trump\u2019s defense, which he had discussed with the president on a phone call before the text message:\n\nSondland plans to tell lawmakers he has no knowledge of whether the president was telling him the truth at that moment. \u201cIt\u2019s only true that the president said it, not that it was the truth,\u201d said the person familiar with Sondland\u2019s planned testimony, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters. ... The person familiar with Sondland\u2019s testimony said the ambassador \u201cbelieved Trump at the time and on that basis passed along assurances\u201d that Trump was not withholding military aid for political purposes. But Sondland\u2019s testimony will raise the possibility that Trump wasn\u2019t truthful in his denial of a quid pro quo as well as an alternative scenario in which the president\u2019s interest in the scheme soured at a time when his administration faced mounting scrutiny over why it was withholding about $400 million in security assistance to Ukraine and delaying a leader-level visit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cWhether he\u2019s deciding it\u2019s getting too hot to handle and he backs off whatever his position really was a month earlier, I don\u2019t know,\u201d the person said of Sondland\u2019s understanding. ... Sondland is expected to say that for months before the Sept. 9 message, he worked at the direction of Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, to secure what he would call in another text message the \u201cdeliverable\u201d sought by Trump: a public statement from Ukraine that it would investigate corruption, including mentioning Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, by name. In exchange for the statement, the president would grant Ukraine\u2019s new president a coveted White House audience.\n\nThis is remarkable stuff, especially considering that Sondland, unlike the two diplomats he was conversing with in those text messages, was a big-time Trump donor. He was also the only one of the three who hadn\u2019t suggested there was a quid pro quo. (Volker suggested it involved a meeting with Zelensky, while the U.S. charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, suggested it involved hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid that was being withheld.)\n\nTrump and his defenders have hailed Sondland\u2019s text as being dispositive. Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel, in a column promoted by Trump on Friday, accused the mainstream media of ignoring the important text and said Sondland had \u201cshut down\u201d the claim of a quid pro quo. Trump himself tweeted the quote, saying \u201cThat says it ALL!\u201d\n\n....to see. Importantly, Ambassador Sondland\u2019s tweet, which few report, stated, \u201cI believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d That says it ALL! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\nOf course, the idea that Trump\u2019s defense would ever rest on that quote was folly from the beginning. As soon as the texts were released, pretty much anybody who understands how these things work viewed Sondland\u2019s text as a very lawyered-sounding expression of the party line. It seemed to be exactly the kind of thing intended for public consumption if these texts ever became part of an investigation. And his suggestion that they take the conversation off text messages \u2014 and perhaps to a medium with no paper trail \u2014 also indicated that he knew something problematic was taking place.\n\nIt turns out that appearance didn\u2019t lie. That\u2019s pretty much exactly what happened.\n\nThe implosion of this particular Trump defense epitomizes the broader problem his supporters have here. The vast majority of Republicans have been unwilling to go to bat for Trump, avoiding the questions or deflecting them and talking about something else (like about how there really is corruption in Ukraine). That\u2019s largely because they have little faith that something more incriminating might eventually come out, making their defenses look silly. Trump and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, simply don\u2019t appear to have taken much care to avoid at least the appearance of soliciting foreign influence on an American election.\n\nThe other quote Trump and his defenders often point to is from Zelensky, who said he didn\u2019t feel pressured in that July 25 phone call with Trump. Much like Sondland, though, Zelensky has an interest in downplaying anything corrupt, because Ukraine relies on the United States. Zelensky can\u2019t just come out and accuse Trump of doing something wrong. He also has a personal interest in not looking like Trump\u2019s stooge, which he was at risk of after the rough transcript showed him apparently acceding to Trump\u2019s requests to launch certain investigations.\n\nThe fact that these statements are at the core of the Trump defense shows just how little they are working with at this point. It\u2019s simply difficult to argue that Trump didn\u2019t, at the very least, toy with a quid pro quo, even if it might have been implicit.\n\nIn the tweet above, Trump indicated that he \u201cwould love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify.\u201d\n\nIt sounds as if that may not be the case anymore. Sondland\u2019s impending testimony sounds like that of a man covering his own backside and knowing his apparent defense of Trump could quickly fall apart upon further examination.", "description": "The Post reports that he will tell Congress there was a quid pro quo \u2014 thought not a \"corrupt\" one, according to a person close to him.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vnU5Ui5f_1_rxhNv-Um0FHoQWKo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMVJ6THNCEI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
