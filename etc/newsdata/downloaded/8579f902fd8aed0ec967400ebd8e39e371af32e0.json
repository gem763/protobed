Before that pass, Oregon ran six consecutive times for 45 yards, including Travis Dye\u2019s 21-yard carry to the Huskies 27.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOregon remained the lone team without a conference loss in the Pac-12 thanks in part to Herbert\u2019s 280 passing yards and four touchdowns on 24-of-38 completions without an interception. The senior is ranked as high as No. 2 among quarterback prospects, according to multiple NFL mock draft websites.\n\nLast season Herbert became the fastest player in school history to reach 4,000 and 5,000 career passing yards, needing 17 and 21 games, respectively. He finished tied for 13th nationally with 29 touchdown passes and 27th in passing yards with 3,151.\n\nA handful of mock draft websites had listed Herbert as the No. 1 quarterback prospect had he elected to turn pro after last season. A two-time academic all-American, Herbert, a native of Eugene, Ore., instead opted to come back for his senior year to earn his degree in biology.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOregon had trailed by 10 points in the third quarter Saturday before staging the comeback that put the Ducks well on their way to clinching the Pac-12 North Division title under third-year coach Mario Cristobal.\n\nThe Huskies (5-3, 2-3), meanwhile, got 289 yards and three touchdowns without an interception from Eason, who completed 23 of 30 attempts. The redshirt junior began his career at Georgia, losing the starting job to Jake Fromm, before transferring to his home state school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those games you grow up wanting to be a part of,\u201d Eason, who grew up in Lake Stevens, Wash., told reporters last week, regarding the rivalry between the Ducks and Huskies. \u201cObviously you want your hometown team to win, but I was so little, sometimes I didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEason and Herbert are part of a crowded field of quarterback prospects heading into the 2020 NFL draft.\n\nAD\n\nOther college quarterbacks reportedly high on NFL draft boards include Alabama\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa, Louisiana State\u2019s Joe Burrow and Oklahoma\u2019s Jalen Hurts, all considered among the favorites to win the Heisman Trophy.\n\nHurts accounted for five touchdowns in the No. 5 Sooners\u2019 52-14 win against West Virginia, and Burrow threw four touchdown passes in the second-ranked Tigers\u2019 36-13 victory over Mississippi State.\n\nThe top-ranked Crimson Tide faced visiting Tennessee on Saturday night.\n\nRead more on college football:\n\nAD", "description": "No. 12 Ducks keep College Football Playoff hopes alive with a 35-31 win on the road.", "authors": ["Gene Wang", "Sports Reporter Covering Local", "National College Football"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FCJqOgcJjyDvcrBQIPHBszJGR5k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RHPTB5HSWYI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
