If this represents a new established position, then it means a deal is essentially impossible not just now but ever. It also made clear that they are willing to torpedo the Good Friday Agreement,\" the official said.\n\nA German government spokesperson confirmed that Merkel and Johnson spoke on Tuesday morning but said that \"as usual\" they would not be commenting on what was discussed.\n\nAsked if the Commission believed that Northern Ireland has to remain in the customs union forever, Commission spokesperson Mina Andreeva said: \"You are referring to comments we haven\u2019t seen chancellor confirm.\"\n\nWhen asked if the Brexit talks were breaking down, Andreeva said \"technical talks are happening today\" so she couldn't \"see how they could be breaking down.\"", "description": "An official spoke to journalists after a phone call between Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel.", "authors": ["Annabelle Dickson", "Cristina Gallardo", "Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174204660-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
