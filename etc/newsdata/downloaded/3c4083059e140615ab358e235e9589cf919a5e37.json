He also played a small but memorable role in Amy Schumer\u2019s comedy, Trainwreck, which came out in 2015.\n\nBut the New Jersey-born actor acquired a new kind of mainstream fame after he played the ominous character of Credence in the first Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them film, which forms part of a series of Harry Potter prequels written by JK Rowling.\n\nHe\u2019s spent the last few weeks doing the promotional rounds for The Crimes of Grindelwald, the second film in the franchise, and has cemented himself as a bona fide fashion darling with his idiosyncratic and playful looks, all of which are a far cry from the average male celebrity\u2019s wardrobe.\n\nFor the world premiere in Paris, the quirky film star struck a startling silhouette in a full-length hooded puffer dress from Moncler\u2019s collaboration with Pierpaolo Piccioli, which prompted a sea of praise on social media.\n\nWas it a reconstructed duvet? Was it a \"sassy sleeping bag\"? Or, was it alien garb sent down to earth from another planet? These are the kinds of questions that keep Miller\u2019s fans coming back for more. and making copious memes.\n\nSome people praised the outfit, which Miller paired with dark red lipstick, for its sheer eccentricity, while others lauded the actor for veering away from gender norms and shunning the tradition suit and tie uniform that dominates men\u2019s red carpet fashion.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
