The service allows Walmart\u2019s camera-equipped \u201cassociates\u201d to enter your home and deliver food directly into your fridge.\n\nWalmart\u2019s service doesn\u2019t come cheap. You\u2019ll need to pay $49.95 upfront to have the company install the Level Home smart lock or the Nortek garage door tech its associates need to get into your home, and then there\u2019s a $19.95 monthly fee to pay as well (although the first month is free). This fee gets you unlimited deliveries, although they\u2019ll need to contain at least $30 worth of items to qualify for InHome Delivery.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to pay a $19.95 monthly fee for the service\n\nIf the idea of having a driver bring deliveries directly into your home sounds familiar, that\u2019s because Amazon has been offering the same thing for a while now as part of its Key home delivery service. First launched back in 2017, Amazon\u2019s service has since expanded to allow delivery drivers to access your garage or even the trunk of your car. British supermarket Waitrose has also trialed a similar service in the UK.\n\nYou can head over to InHome.Walmart.com to see if your address is eligible.", "description": "Walmart\u2019s InHome delivery service is now available for over 1 million customers in three US cities; Kansas City, Missouri; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Vero Beach, Florida.
