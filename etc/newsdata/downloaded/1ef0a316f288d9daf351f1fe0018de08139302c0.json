He appears to genuinely believe that impeachment will have a profoundly positive effect on Trump\u2019s political fortunes, according to 3 sources who have heard Mulvaney make the 45-state prediction.\n\nMulvaney also believes that the longer the impeachment process drags on, the better it is, politically, for Trump, these sources added.\n\nMulvaney did not stipulate which 5 states he thought Trump would still lose when he made these comments, a source who heard them said.\n\nHis view appears to be based more on instinct than polling data. I have seen no polling that supports his prediction, and at this early stage, responsible polling analysts are extremely wary of predicting which party will benefit more from impeachment in 2020.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
