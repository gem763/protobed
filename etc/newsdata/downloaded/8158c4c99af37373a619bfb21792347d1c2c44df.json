Aghamalian first entered the U.S. as a refugee when he was 15-years-old.\n\nSeam, a 41-year-old refugee from Cambodia was pardoned following his August 1996 conviction where a jury found him guilty of robbery, as well as an accessory to a high-speed chase where he was helping a wanted fugitive evade arrest by police. Seam first entered the U.S. as a refugee when he was 4-years-old.\n\nAlso pardoned by Newsom is 38-year-old Victor Ayala, a legal immigrant from El Salvador, who was convicted in 1999, 2000, and 2001 for misdemeanor theft, hit-and-run, and felony theft. Ayala first entered the U.S. when he was 2-years-old.\n\nNewsom\u2019s pardoning of the immigrants comes after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo pardoned six illegal alien convicts last year to help them evade deportation.\n\nAn investigation by the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) in 2018 revealed that California\u2019s sanctuary state policy \u2014 which shields criminal illegal aliens from deportation \u2014 is likely responsible for at least 5,000 crimes committed by criminal illegal aliens previously freed into the general public by the state.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
