I do not gloat. I admire all of my work colleagues, even the Michigan ones. Also: Do you know how hard it is to get a 90-foot-tall inflatable Jim Harbaugh balloon made with two days notice?\n\nIt\u2019s hard. I\u2019ve been on the phone for hours!\n\n(The best idea I heard was from a reader who suggested going into the office and waiting for the first Journal Wolverine to say \u201cCongratulations\u201d and to then act baffled, and respond, \u201cCongratulations for what?\u201d I would offer some excuse for not knowing what happened on Saturday, like saying I was stuck in the office elevator all weekend, and I would force them to painfully explain what happened, the entire game, including how Wisconsin ran out to a 28-0 lead at halftime, and Jonathan Taylor\u2019s 203 rushing yards, and I would react incredulously to every detail. \u201cWow! You\u2019re KIDDING! Wisconsin did THAT?\u201d This was a delightfully impish proposal, but I fear it would result in my getting punched in the ear.)\n\nYes: it\u2019s true. Wisconsin defeated Michigan, civilization is safe, and the planet can move on. I got to see it for myself, in Madison, in all its red and white glory, and I can honestly say it is one of the happiest days of my life, right up there with the birth of my children and the time I found a perfectly good doughnut in the glovebox of the family car. I\u2019m still not entirely certain it happened\u2014as the nerds say, it\u2019s possible we are living in a computer simulation, and this is all the work of a computer, though a computer definitely could not have simulated that bratwurst I ate at halftime, because that bratwurst was delicious.\n\nWisconsin running back Jonathan Taylor celebrates a touchdown against Michigan.

I don\u2019t know if I should be insulted or not, but some of my Wolverine co-workers are acting like losing badly to Wisconsin is, in fact, the end of civilization, as if it\u2019s Appalachian State all over again (and by the way, App State did it again, knocking off North Carolina Saturday). Wolverines are profoundly crabby about this. I am not exaggerating when I say there were text messages between them wondering if a college football coach has ever been relieved of his duties at halftime.\n\nThat\u2019s absurd, of course. And, for the record, I adore Jim Harbaugh, aka Coach Khakipants, for giving this game a dose of some good-natured celebrity villainy, and lifting Wisconsin-Michgan into a mammoth college football contest. Madison really felt like the center of the sports universe on Saturday\u2014at least until the evening, when UCLA and Washington State played that berserk Pac-12 videogame contest that ended with the Bruins coming back from 32 down in the third quarter and winning 67-63.\n\n(That game was cuckoo. The Washington State QB, Anthony Gordon, threw nine touchdown passes\u2014and lost!)\n\nIt is Jim Harbaugh\u2019s fifth season, and his Wolverines remain a frustrating outfit.

This is what Michigan put on itself when it brought Harbaugh back home, to Ann Arbor, after an impressive coaching run elsewhere in college and the NFL. It made too much sense: a local kid, a genuine Son of Schembechler, who knew what the program meant and was going to return it to the mountaintop. They paid a vast sum to get him, reportedly north of $7 million a year, and yet now it is Harbaugh\u2019s fifth season, and his Wolverines remain a frustrating outfit, incapable of cracking the football elite and, worse, going 0-4 versus Ohio State.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem, but I ask: what is the solution? Harbaugh appears created in a lab to coach the Michigan Wolverines. This is the sort of merciless impatience that gets created in the hothouse of college athletics, where all that hype and money emits a clear and uncompromising message: win immediately, win decisively, and no regression. Harbaugh has more than a little time in Ann Arbor, and now has no luxury of a reset. The vultures are swirling, asking about buyouts and NFL interest. I can\u2019t imagine the freakout if Ohio State pounds them again.\n\nI say: breathe. College football frenzies itself like no other sport; all those expectations can suck all the life out of something that is supposed to be, you know, fun. (Look at UCLA, where there\u2019s been a similar rage-pile on fancy coach Chip Kelly.) It\u2019s easy to fall into that trap of wanting perfection, but perfection is futile. We\u2019re all probably playing for the right to get steamrolled by Alabama or Clemson in January.\n\nOf course, this is easy for me to say, after a magical weekend in Madison. Wisconsin is undefeated, humankind is saved, and all I\u2019ve got to do is find a Badger costume to wear into the office on Monday. Or Tuesday. It was a weekend in Madison, after all, and I\u2019m\u2026tired.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Should Michigan consider replacing Jim Harbaugh or would that be a big overreaction?
