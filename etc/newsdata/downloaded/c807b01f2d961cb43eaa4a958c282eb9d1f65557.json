We urge a re-engagement with our partners in this region.\"\n\nTrump suggested Monday that he would leave some U.S. troops in Syria to protect oil resources, but said he saw no need for U.S. forces to defend America's Kurdish partners.\n\n\"We never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives,\" Trump told reporters at a Cabinet meeting at the White House. \"Where is the agreement we have to stay in the Middle East for the rest of humanity?\"\n\nErdogan is expected to visit Trump at the White House in mid-November, though Erdogan said in Istanbul last week that he is also rethinking the trip because \"arguments, debates, conversations being held in Congress regarding my person, my family and my minister friends are a very big disrespect\" to the Turkish government, Reuters reported.\n\nSeveral senators have said in recent days that the invitation to Erdogan should be rescinded.\n\n\"Erdogan's attack on our Kurdish partners has served to liberate ISIS prisoners, bolster the Assad regime, and strengthen Russia,\" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., a member of the Armed Services Committee, tweeted last week. \"His invitation to the White House should be revoked.\"", "description": "\"Our resolution acknowledges the vital role that our Kurdish and Arab Syrian partners have played in rooting out and destroying ISIS's caliphate,\" McConnell said on the floor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4251424/1000x563_nbc-190709-mitch-mcconnell-cs-335p_4de1ec10ed3f1452819e6827fca1e5af.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
