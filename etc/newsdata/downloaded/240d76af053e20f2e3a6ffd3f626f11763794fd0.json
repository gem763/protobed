USA TODAY\n\nFRISCO, Texas \u2014 Jourdan Lewis didn\u2019t need to hear the end of the question.\n\nHe didn\u2019t need to be told about Eagles coach Doug Pederson\u2019s comments asserting that Philadelphia would win in Arlington this weekend to overtake the Cowboys for first place in the NFC East.\n\nYes, the Cowboys cornerback said, he\u2019d heard.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Lewis told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cYou\u2019ve still got to face an opponent and the results are still uncertain, so that\u2019s definitely something to get his team riled up and ready to play.\n\n\u201cWhen you put your affirmations out there so confidently, you feel like it means something way more than it\u2019s already supposed to mean.\u201d\n\nA Cowboys team that\u2019s bought into Jason Garrett\u2019s \u201cworry about ourselves\u201d mantra had heard, by Monday evening locker room availability, what Pederson said. The Eagles coach told Philadelphia radio station 94.1 WIP that \u201cwe\u2019re gonna win that football game, and when we do, we\u2019re in first place in the NFC East.\u201d He later insisted to reporters he didn\u2019t assure a win.\n\n\u201cNever said guarantee a win,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cI'd never do that.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys, in the midst of a three-game losing streak, didn\u2019t formally discuss the comments, players said. Sure, it\u2019s yet another element of the rivalry that \u201cmakes us come out a little bit fired up,\u201d receiver Michael Gallup said. But did a .500 Cowboys team playing for first place in the division ahead of their bye week really need more fuel?\n\n\u201cIf you need a coach, or anybody else, to fire you up, I don\u2019t think you really should be playing,\u201d Gallup said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Dak says, really every week. We shouldn\u2019t [need] anybody else to motivate us to be fired up. You should already have that. For me, I\u2019m not looking for anybody to fire me up.\u201d\n\nWill Cowboys show Doug Pederson's comments as bulletin board material?\n\n\n\n\"We probably don\u2019t want to share what we share with our players too much,\" Jason Garrett said. \"We do our best when we just focus on ourselves and what we need to do to prepare to play our best football.\" \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 14, 2019\n\nThe Cowboys are, however, looking for answers after allowing a winless Jets team to outlast them 24-22 on Sunday. The loss followed performances that fell short in New Orleans (12-10) and at home against the Packers (34-24). They struggled against the Jets to stop the pass, to convert red-zone opportunities, to protect quarterback Dak Prescott and to catch balls. Three of Prescott\u2019s targets dropped a combined five passes.\n\n\u201cI just need to catch the ball,\u201d said Gallup, who caught one of four targets for 17 yards. \u201cI just had three balls go right through my fingers. \u2026 Supposedly we\u2019re supposed to be on the same page. I think we are. We\u2019re just not executing plays.\u201d\n\nMichael Gallup had four catches for 48 yards in the Cowboys' loss to the Jets.

Against the Packers, quarterback Dak Prescott threw three interceptions that ultimately transformed 563 offensive yards into a production that was too little, too late. Green Bay running back Aaron Jones gashed Dallas\u2019 defense for four touchdowns \u2014 the first time the franchise had ever surrendered four scores to a running back in a single game.\n\nDallas didn\u2019t turn the ball over against the Jets, and allowed a Le\u2019veon Bell-led attack just 56 rushing yards. But the offense found new problems, including drops on a day in which their four sidelined starters included receivers Amari Cooper and Randall Cobb. The secondary allowed the Jets more touchdowns than they had scored in four weeks \u2014 including a 92-yard bomb from Sam Darnold to Robby Anderson.\n\nThe Cowboys and Garrett \u2014 who is coaching in a contract year \u2014 need answers this week and for their remaining 10 games.\n\nBut responding to Pederson with a public win guarantee in return isn\u2019t it.\n\n\u201cMy response is we\u2019re excited about the challenge,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cObviously they\u2019re a great football team and we\u2019re going to focus on ourselves and what we need to do to prepare to play our best football on Sunday night.\u201d\n\nLewis agreed.\n\n\u201cWe got to go out there and play with a fire,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t talk about it anymore. Go out there as a team and be working.\n\n\u201cI know it feels like we\u2019re [in] a lull. But we\u2019re going to get back on track. I promise you we\u2019re going to get back on track.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see us fight.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports\u2019 Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
