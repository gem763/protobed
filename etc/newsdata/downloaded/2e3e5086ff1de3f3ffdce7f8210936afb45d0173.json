Later, during dinner, James said his wife, Savannah, wrote Davis a card.\n\n\"I was like, 'Why is Savannah giving me a card?'\" Davis told McMenamin. He read the card, which said \"Welcome to LA,\" among other things, and realized it was actually signed by James.\n\nJames then pulled the jersey out of the bag and handed it to Davis.
