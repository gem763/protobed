Breaking the new fire safety rules could prompt a fine of up to 3,000 roubles (\u00a338; \u20ac42; $47), while leaving a lighted cigarette that causes a fire could prompt criminal charges.\n\n'What's the use of a balcony if you can't smoke?'\n\nBy Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring\n\nWhen the ban takes effect on 1 October, its impact is going to be profound.\n\nRussian cities mostly consist of high-rises, and balconies are where people usually smoke when they are at home. Few will be willing to get dressed and take the lift downstairs just for a quick smoke.\n\nAnd this is the point made by many commentators online.\n\n\"What's the use of a balcony if you can't smoke there?\" asked one commentator on the popular website TJournal.\n\n\"Banning people from smoking on their own balconies is nonsensical. The government has simply banned people from using their own property,\" said one popular tweet.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A ban on smoking in Russian restaurants prompted a drop in customers\n\n\"And this is the kind of job we pay the government billions of roubles for each year,\" said another.\n\nThe head of the All-Russian Movement for Smokers' Rights, Andrey Loskutov, was also fuming. \"They've banned it everywhere they could. Now they remembered they forgot about balconies,\" he told Interfax news agency.\n\nBut Channel 5 TV was resigned: \"Russians will just have to find somewhere else to smoke.\"", "description": "The move sparks anger, as most Russians live in flats and balconies are where they tend to smoke.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D4C5/production/_108996445_gettyimages-923025622-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
