Sanders' team is also coming under fire from some journalists and Democrats for not announcing earlier that he suffered a heart attack. His aides have declined to allow reporters to interview Sanders\u2019 doctors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where the cover-up is worse than the crime,\u201d said Andres Ramirez, a Nevada-based Democratic strategist and former vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Hispanic Caucus. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would have cared if they said he had a heart attack, got out a few days later, and then everything\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nInstead, he said, \u201cThere seemed to be a refusal or hesitance to say, \u2018Bernie Sanders had a heart attack.\u2019 \u2026 I think it\u2019s less of an issue about his age and more of an issue of, \u2018Hey, Bernie, you\u2019re supposed to be the transparent candidate.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn an all-staff conference call described to POLITICO by people who listened in, Sanders suggested on Monday that he would use his experience to pivot back to one of his campaign\u2019s central ideas. The same afternoon, he and his wife, Jane, also made a brief appearance leaving his home in Vermont for what appeared to be a brisk walk.\n\nNot one person with this hysterical take can articulate a legitimate risk that three days of privacy (followed by disclosure) over a year before an election presented to the republic. - Briahna Joy Gray, Bernie Sanders\u2019 national press secretary\n\n\"If there's anything that this event kind of tell us, it is the importance of what our message is in this campaign. And our message is, 'Us, not me.' This has never been about me,\" Sanders told his team during the call. \"It's been about millions of people, including certainly our campaign staff, working together to bring about the kind of fundamental changes this nation absolutely needs.\"\n\nSanders\u2019 aides are adamant they handled the health incident appropriately and have taken to social media to defend themselves against criticism, which has come from reporters such as NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell and Rolling Stone senior writer Jamil Smith. The aides said they provided several updates on Sanders\u2019 recovery last week, released a statement from his doctors, and made his wife available for questions.\n\n\u201cNot one person with this hysterical take can articulate a legitimate risk that three days of privacy (followed by disclosure) over a year before an election presented to the republic,\u201d Briahna Joy Gray, Sanders\u2019 national press secretary, wrote on Twitter.\n\nMike Casca, a spokesman for Sanders, told POLITICO that the campaign disclosed that he had a heart attack \u201cwhen the most accurate and up-to-date summary could be given by doctors.\"\n\nWhen Sanders returns to the stump, he will be confronted with a barrage of questions about his age and health \u2014 a less-than-ideal position for any candidate, let alone one who often loathes talking about his personal life. Polls have shown for months that many Democratic voters are wary of nominating a candidate in their 70s, and Sanders had slipped to third place in national polling averages before his heart attack.\n\n\u201cBernie will address it by having a strong debate performance, by being out on the trail, and showing that he\u2019s more energized and has more fighting spirit than ever before,\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna, Sanders\u2019 campaign co-chair. \u201cI think that\u2019s ultimately what will convince people that he has the fight in him.\u201d\n\nAdded a Sanders aide: \u201cAs Bernie\u2019s done his whole career by being right on the issues even when no one else was with him, we'll be in \u2018show, don't tell\u2019 mode.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 surrogates also expect to deal with questions about his heart attack in part by discussing Medicare for All, his signature issue. Vermont Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman, a surrogate for Sanders, said that because he has good, government-provided health care, his hospitalization will not hurt him financially \u2014 whereas many people in the same situation \u201cwould be fine one day and bankrupt the next.\u201d\n\nSome of Sanders\u2019 allies also believe he should use his experience to get more personal with voters, something his aides have long pushed him to do in general, and trim his relentless campaign schedule.\n\n\u201cI hope he uses this to share a part of him,\u201d said Khanna. \u201cIf he shares that moment of vulnerability and his gratitude for having access to the greatest health care in the world, and his resilience to fight for that for every person \u2026 that will draw a human connection with people.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 team has not said when he will return to the campaign trail, but has confirmed that he will participate in the Oct. 15 debate. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a top ally to Sanders, said the Vermont senator is nonetheless back to work.\n\n\u201cBernie\u2019s doing fine,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s working and he\u2019s busy and he\u2019s thinking and he\u2019s planning.\u201d\n\nPolitical operatives who have worked for presidential candidates who experienced health scares on the campaign trail said transparency is key.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to be as upfront as you can as quickly as you can,\u201d said Karen Finney, a former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, adding that there may have been a medical reason that Sanders\u2019 team did not disclose his heart attack earlier. \u201cBecause to some degree, it becomes a trust issue.\u201d\n\nGina Glantz, the former campaign manager for Bill Bradley\u2019s 2000 presidential bid, said she believes that his treatment for an irregular heartbeat during the election was one of the reasons he lost the New Hampshire primary. She said Sanders has two things going for him that Bradley did not: The first votes will not be cast for another four months. And social media exists now.\n\n\u201cFor five weeks, there was virtually no mention of Bill Bradley in the press, and we didn\u2019t have the tools to keep him alive in the voters\u2019 minds,\u201d she said.\n\nIf Democrats nominate an older candidate \u2014 whether it's Sanders, Joe Biden or Warren \u2014 some party insiders worry that they will cede a generational contrast that they might otherwise have made with President Donald Trump, the oldest person ever to take office. But Trump\u2019s age \u2014 he is now 73 \u2014 is also seen as neutralizing the effect of an older Democratic nominee.\n\nBiden, Sanders and Warren have all taken steps during the campaign to project an image of vigor \u2014 Biden and Warren by running at parades and public events, and Sanders with his frenetic schedule. Sanders also recently played a softball game with his aides and others, and frequently shoots hoops on the campaign trail.\n\nIf his heart attack does rattle Sanders' supporters, several Democratic operatives said it's likely to benefit his friend and fellow progressive Warren. But the effect may be more limited than if Sanders were competing against a much younger Democrat in the top tier.\n\nBiden, Sanders and Warren are all septuagenarians who enjoy high name ID, and Democrats like them in spite of \u2014 or, in some cases, because of \u2014 their advanced age. Some of Warren\u2019s allies also believe that Sanders being in the primary actually benefits her by providing a shield against the more moderate wing of the party as well as other opponents.\n\n\"Everyone wants Bernie Sanders to be well. Politically, it's good for Warren and Sanders to have each other in the race,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren. \u201cOne of the biggest things preventing corporate CEOs from dumping tens of millions of dollars in TV ads against Warren or Sanders is that if you knock one out, you help the other. And if you run ads hitting both of them, you just elevate them as the two most clear and transformational progressives.\"", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Briahna Joy Gray", "Bernie Sanders", "National Press Secretary"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/89/13/f92965f54e7ba3c7b625cb987032/20191007-bernie-sanders-new-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
