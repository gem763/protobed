In 2007, the year that Colombian emigration to Venezuela peaked, the United Nations refugee agency reported that 200,000 Colombians were living in Venezuela as refugees or asylum-seekers.\n\nThe fact that Venezuela accepted this population and provided shelter to Colombians for decades has definitely helped shape Colombia's response to the more recent influx from Venezuela. Granted, a significant number of those border-crossers have been Colombians returning home from Venezuela with their families, so measures had to be taken to accept and assist this population.\n\nAt the same time, as Colombia's previous foreign minister, Maria Angela Holguin, repeatedly affirmed at the height of the migrant crisis, there was a moral duty to repay the Venezuelan people for the solidarity they showed to Colombians in the past. However, this ideal of reciprocity has faded from the government's public statements more recently.\n\nColombia has also repeatedly accused the Venezuelan government of providing shelter, funds and even military training to Colombia's largest guerrilla groups: the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and the National Liberation Army, or ELN. This has further embittered an already complicated bilateral relationship.\n\nBy opening their doors to Venezuelan migrants, Colombian authorities sought to make a statement about what they see as President Nicolas Maduro's lack of legitimacy, as well as his government's inability to provide assistance and protection to its own citizens.\n\nBut after more than 50 years of coping with an internal armed conflict, Colombia has limited resources to assist new migrants from Venezuela. As a result of those decades of strife, Colombia has the highest number of internally displaced people in the world, and it is still struggling to develop durable solutions for them.", "description": "Colombia has rolled out a number of ad hoc measures to deal with the influx, but the migrants are likely to be there for some time.", "authors": ["The Editors", "World Politics Review"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d850e3e2e22af4c7c200f9a-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
