This summer's protests, sparked by rising public anger towards Beijing's rule, has battered the economy of the Asian financial hub. Li Ka-shing's announcement came shortly before the city's chief executive Carrie Lam announced a law banning face masks in public. The 91-year-old billionaire said small and medium-sized businesses would benefit from the fund, worth HK$1 billion (\u00a3104 million, US$128 million). The donation will be distributed in partnership with the government.\n\n'People are asking can Hong Kong go back to normal? Is Hong Kong still a place where we can have our sweet home?' Lam asked as she announced the ban.\n\nShe said the ban targeted violent protesters and rioters and 'will be an effective deterrent to radical behavior'.\n\nThe decision applies to people at 'illegal' gatherings who use violence and exempts those who wear masks for 'legitimate need'. Lam said she would go to the legislature later to get legal backing for the rule.\n\nBut a government document detailing the move says it will not only cover unauthorised or illegal assemblies, but also apply to gatherings approved by police.\n\nThe document was given to reporters during Lam's news conference.\n\nLam, who attended China's National Day festivities in Beijing this week, said the ban was her own government's call, not an order from Beijing.\n\nShe reiterated she would not quit, saying her departure would not resolve the crisis.\n\nShe denied the act was a step closer to authoritarian rule, saying she used a valid legislation to restore order.\n\nThe leader also urged the international community to understand her government's plight and have 'sympathy'.\n\nChina today condemned the 'reckless and criminal behaviour' by some Hong Kong activists.\n\nAn anti-government protester wears a mask during a demonstration in Wong Tai Sin district to denounce the new regulation\n\nAnti-government protesters burn a banner that commemorates the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 4 after Lam announced the new law to ban demonstrators from wearing masks during protests\n\nYang Guang, a spokesman for China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said in Beijing that it was evident that the protests were becoming a 'colour revolution' with the interference from 'external forces'.\n\nWhat is Hong Kong's mask ban? Hong Kong residents have been banned from wearing masks during rallies. The rule applies to people at 'illegal' gatherings who use violence and exempts those who wear masks for 'legitimate need'. Protesters will also be prohibited from painting their faces to hide their identity. Police will have the power to ask a person to remove their masks and those who resist can be sentenced for up to six months The ban covers any procession with over 30 people and assemblies of more than 50 people. The ban carries a penalty of up to a year in jail.\n\nYang said: 'Some street resistance is turning in the direction of masterminded, planned and organised violence crimes and has seriously threatened public safety.'\n\nHe described the mask ban as 'lawful, reasonable, equitable' and 'extremely necessary'.\n\nThe city's Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-Chiu said the mask ban would carry a jail sentence for up to a one year or a fine of up to HK$25,000 (\u00a32,584).\n\nHe said protesters would also be prohibited from painting their faces to hide their identity.\n\nHe added police would have the power to ask a person to remove their masks and those who resist can be sentenced for up to six months.\n\nThe ban covers any procession with over 30 people and assemblies of more than 50 people, according to Lee.\n\nYesterday, local media reported that Lam planned to bypass the legislature to announce the ban under emergency powers to quash the city's chaos.\n\nThousands of people, all wearing masks, chanted slogans calling for greater democracy as they marched in the city's business district during lunch time ahead of Lam's press conference.\n\nOne protester told reporters: 'Will they arrest 100,000 people on the street? The government is trying to intimidate us but at this moment, I don't think the people will be scared.'\n\nImmediately defying the ban set to take effect Saturday, thousands of activists cram streets shouting 'Hong Kongers, resist'\n\nA woman holds up a handbill as protesters gather in the street in the heart of Hong Kong's commercial district on October 4\n\nProtesters carry on wearing masks as they block a street after the city's government passed a new law to curb demonstrations\n\nThe ban was passed under a colonial-era emergency law known as The Emergency Regulations Ordinance.\n\nThe law, a relic of British rule enacted in 1922 to quell a seamen's strike which was last used to crush riots in 1967, gives broad powers to the city's chief executive to implement regulations in an emergency.\n\nHong Kong teen shot by police was 'rioting', prosecutor says The 18-year-old protester shot in the chest by Hong Kong police this week was throwing bricks and 'rioting' at the time he was wounded, a prosecutor told a court on Friday. Tsang Chi-kin was shot at close range on Tuesday as he fought officers with what appeared to be a white pole. He has been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum 10-year sentence, and assaulting an officer. The prosecutor said Tsang was more violent than others who have attended recent rallies.\n\nAnalysts have warned that the use of the Ordinance for the first time in more than half a century could set a dangerous precedent.\n\nActivists and many legislators have also concerned the ban could be counter-productive, impractical and difficult to enforce in a city bubbling with anger and where tens of thousands have often defied police bans on rallies to take to the streets.\n\nWilly Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said: 'Even though the mask ban is just a small move under the Emergency Ordinance, it is a dangerous first step.\n\n'If the anti-mask legislation proves to be ineffective, it could lead the way to more draconian measures such as a curfew and other infringement of civil liberties.'\n\n'This is a watershed. This is a Rubicon,' pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo told AFP.\n\n'And I'm worried this could be just a starter. More draconian bans in the name of law could be lurking around the corner.'\n\n'It is ironic that a colonial-era weapon is being used by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Communist Party,' Joshua Wong, a leading activists who has been jailed a number of times, told AFP.\n\nThe United Nations human rights office said that any new government measures in Hong Kong must be grounded in law and protect the right to freedom of assembly.\n\nPeople wearing face masks walk past debris earlier burnt by protesters in the street in the heart of Hong Kong on October 4\n\nLam decried the recent escalation of violence at a press conference (pictured) after clashes erupted across the city this week\n\nReferring to the situation in the financial hub, UN human rights spokeswoman Marta Hurtado told a briefing in Geneva on Friday: 'Any restriction must have a basis in law and be proportionate and as least intrusive as possible.'\n\nPolice relax guidelines for using force Hong Kong police loosened guidelines on the use of force by officers in the run-up to demonstrations on October 1, according to documents seen by Reuters. The move would give officers greater power to deal with protesters in difficult situations. In the documents, the police manual changed some guidelines on how officers could act when considering force. It also removed a line that stated officers should be accountable for their actions.\n\nShe added: 'Freedom of peaceful assembly is a fundamental right and should be enjoyed without restriction to the greatest extent possible.'\n\nThe ban follows widespread violence in the city which marred China's National Day and included a police officer shooting a protester, the first victim of gunfire since the protests started in June.\n\nTsang Chi-kin, 18, was shot at close range as he fought an officer with a pole on Tuesday in Tsuen Wan on one of the most violent days of the ongoing protests.\n\nPolice defended the officer's decision, calling it 'reasonable and lawful'. A spokesperson said the officer was facing 'imminent danger' at the time.\n\nTsang has undergone surgery. According to his lawyer, he is in a hospital intensive care unit in a stable condition.\n\nHe has been charged with attacking police and rioting. The latter carries a maximum 10-year sentence.\n\nIt has been revealed that the city's police loosened guidelines on the use of force by officers in the run-up to demonstrations on October 1.\n\nThe teenage protester was throwing bricks and 'rioting' at the time he was wounded, a prosecutor told a court packed with his supporters on Friday.\n\nThe prosecutor said Tsang was more violent than others who have attended recent rallies.\n\nA judge set bail at HK$5,000 ($640) and banned Tsang from leaving the country.\n\nAfter the hearing, hundreds of supporters - some crying - clapped and chanted 'thank you' to the lawyer who represented him.\n\nThey also opened umbrellas to form a tunnel outside the court to shield the identity of other arrested protesters who appeared in court.\n\nCecilia Ng, 53, said young people had sacrificed themselves to stop government wrongdoing.\n\nSocial media footage captures the moment Tsang (left) was shot by a policeman during a fight in Tsuen Wan on Tuesday\n\nThe teen was shot in the chest by a police officer whose unit had been attacked by demonstrators, said a police spokesperson\n\n'Yes, they destroy things. But it was completely not necessary to shoot them,' she said.\n\n'The point is that the government taught us that peaceful protest can never work. Now, the government pushes another evil law. Our city is on edge. Our teenagers are also on edge.'\n\nMany of those gathered in the court and outside were wearing masks, in defiance of the mask ban. The ban was announced a short while later.\n\nTsang's case was been adjourned until November 14.", "description": "Tear gas was hurled towards protesters as they crouched with umbrellas to try to avoid the fumes enveloping Hong Kong this evening.
