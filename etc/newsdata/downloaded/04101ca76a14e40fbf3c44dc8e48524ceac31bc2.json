Although coach Jon Gruden said all the right things, Gruden and G.M. Mike Mayock seemed to be trying to manage Brown with a good cop/bad cop approach that ultimately blew up in their faces.\n\nIf they thought they could manage him, they weren\u2019t paying attention to the things he was saying while he was trying to tweet his way out of Pittsburgh. Before anyone else tries to manage him, they need to realize that, while he will indeed show up and work hard and play hard, he can\u2019t and he won\u2019t be managed. He\u2019s doing things his way, and if you want the benefit of his talent that\u2019s the bargain you have to make.\n\nAnd that will make a deal with New England even less likely. He\u2019s clearly not chagrined or contrite or ready to change his ways to meet the requirements of a team. He wants a team that will changes its ways to accommodate him. Which means that only a small handful of teams will even consider it, if that many.\n\nIf these are indeed the ground rules, one team to watch would be Washington, where the village already seems to be burning anyway.", "description": "There may finally be an exception to the saying, \"Once a Raider, always a Raider.\" Receiver Antonio Brown, who was never a Raider for an actual Raiders game, is a Raider no more.
