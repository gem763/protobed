Factually and legally, Taiwan island has been and will always remain an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory. This status will not change, and is impossible to change,\u201d Wang said.\n\nTaiwan now with formal relations with just 15 countries, mostly small and poor nations in Latin America and the Pacific, including Nauru, Tuvalu and Palau.\n\nRelated Coverage Kiribati says national interest behind cutting Taiwan ties in favor of China\n\n\u201cNow, there are only a handful of countries who have not yet established diplomatic relations with China. We believe more and more visionary people in these countries will speak up for justice in keeping with the overriding trend of the times,\u201d Wang said.\n\nBoth the Solomon Islands and Kiribati may be small, developing nations, but they lie in strategic waters that have been dominated by the United States and its allies since the Second World War.\n\n\u2018NATIONAL INTERESTS\u2019\n\nChina routinely denies offering easy cash and loans in return for recognition, which Taiwan has repeatedly accused Beijing of doing, but said this week that both Kiribati and the Solomon Islands would have \u201cunprecedented development opportunities\u201d with China by their side.\n\n\u201cSolomon Islands\u2019 decision to establish relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China is based on our national interests,\u201d Manele said.\n\n\u201cThe development challenges of my country are huge. We need a broader partnership with everyone, including the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d\n\nNeither Wang nor Manele took questions.\n\nChina has yet to formally sign up Kiribati, who had originally abandoned Beijing in Taipei\u2019s favor in 2003, but could hold a ceremony in the Chinese capital in the coming days ahead of Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China.\n\nKiribati said it acted in its best national interest when it severed ties with Taiwan and re-established diplomatic relations with China.\n\nSolomon Islands Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele and Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi hold joint news conference at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, September 21, 2019.
