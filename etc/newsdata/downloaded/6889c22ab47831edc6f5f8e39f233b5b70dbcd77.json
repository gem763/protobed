So yes, well done,\u2019 she said.\n\nKevin and Anneka\u2019s Kill Bill routine failed to impress (Picture: PA)\n\nStacey had been partnered with pro dancer Kevin on Strictly in 2018 and they went on to win the show, taking home the coveted Glitterball trophy.\n\nFollowing the breakdown of her relationship with ex Sam Tucknott, it was revealed Stacey and Kevin are dating.\n\nThe duo are usually pretty private when it comes to their romance \u2013 with the odd relationship update appearing on social media from time to time \u2013 but Stacey has said she and Kevin are very happy.\n\nShe told The Guardian: \u2018Kev and I agreed not to go into too much detail about our private lives because you can\u2019t really indulge that and then ask for privacy.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s why we turned down interviews that offered us tens of thousands of pounds. What I am happy to say is Kev\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m happy, life happens. I\u2019ve got an amazing career and I\u2019m very lucky.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
