Anthony Brindisi voiced his frustrations directly to Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe battleground freshman told Pelosi and other leaders at a closed-door meeting that he and other centrists feared that talk of impeaching President Donald Trump was threatening to swamp the Democratic agenda, according to multiple people in the room.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating for me \u2014 someone coming from a district that was one of the districts that helped get us into the majority \u2014 having so much focus on things like impeachment or other issues that are divisive,\u201d Brindisi said in an interview, adding that he\u2019s been talking to fellow swing-district freshmen who have similar concerns with the fall agenda. \u201cWe should be focusing on the kitchen table issues.\u201d\n\nIn the same meeting, another moderate in the room, Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), pointed to alarming polling from the Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, which showed that voters think the party is \u201cprioritizing impeachment over other issues,\u201d according to an internal summary obtained by POLITICO.\n\nPelosi responded by saying she was keenly aware of their concerns, and reiterated that the caucus does not have 218 votes for impeachment. And she stressed that only the full House has the power to launch proceedings \u2014 a statement that seems to conflict with the Judiciary Committee\u2019s position that it is currently engaged in an impeachment investigation.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Since returning from the summer break, centrist Democrats have been venting \u2014 to each other and directly to Pelosi, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler \u2014 about what they fear the public sees as a fixation on impeachment that could undermine their reelection prospects in 2020, multiple lawmakers and aides said.\n\nPelosi\u2019s efforts to tamp down talk of impeachment, expressed in private and in public, so far haven\u2019t appeased the caucus\u2019 centrist wing.\n\nAnother vulnerable freshman, Rep. Max Rose, gave the same warnings about impeachment in a private meeting with Nadler. A few days later, Rose unleashed his frustrations publicly with an op-ed in his hometown paper, cautioning that Democrats are \u201cin danger of losing the trust of the American people\u201d with its unrelenting focus on Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing what I think is the right thing to do,\u201d Rose said in an interview, adding that no single incident propelled him to write the op-ed. \u201cI want to see this party \u2014 and I know it has it in it \u2014 get to work passing substantive infrastructure and health care bills by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nThe centrists\u2019 aversion to impeachment, however, is just as strong as progressives\u2019 insistence that failing to impeach Trump would be a dereliction of duty \u2014 a direct clash that will only further divide the caucus and test Democratic leaders through the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cWe have to do our job,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (pictured) told reporters last week. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\n\u201cWe have to do our job,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told reporters last week. \u201cI want to see every Republican go on the record and knowingly vote against impeachment of this president, knowing his corruption, having it on the record so that they can have that stain on their careers for the rest of their lives.\u201d\n\nMany Democratic moderates say they recognize that Pelosi and her deputies have tried to contain the impeachment furor from becoming all-consuming on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut as momentum builds \u2014 in part because of Nadler\u2019s committee vote to approve guidelines for his probe \u2014 some lawmakers privately wonder whether Democratic leadership has a strategy to pull them out of the messaging mess they\u2019ve got themselves in.\n\nPelosi has worked to shut down talk about impeachment, both in her news briefings and in some private meetings this week, pivoting instead to the caucus\u2019 bills in progress.\n\nBut Hoyer, her top deputy, fueled headlines after he was forced to walk back comments on the subject after telling reporters the House was not yet in an impeachment investigation \u2014 putting him at odds with Nadler\u2019s phrasing.\n\nIt was exactly the kind of media circus Democrats sought to avoid in their first week back from the long summer recess.\n\nDemocrats from hard-fought seats, including the 31 districts held by Democrats that Trump won in 2016, say they fear the investigations are overtaking their work on other issues.\n\nFor instance, the same week that the Judiciary Committee voted to advance the House investigations into Trump, the panel also approved some of the strongest gun measures in a generation in the wake of this summer\u2019s deadly spate of shootings.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. | Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nHoyer, too, has heard directly from some moderates in the caucus who worry that the House investigations would drown out their work on health care and economic issues throughout the fall, according to a senior Democratic aide.\n\n\u201cThe fear is that you will be exclusively focused on it, to the exclusion of all the other things we need to do in the Congress of the United States,\u201d Hoyer told reporters last week.\n\nMany House centrists, particularly members of the Blue Dog Coalition, have sought to pivot from talking about Trump\u2019s alleged corruption and obstruction to a piece of the Mueller report that\u2019s a lot less controversial: election security.\n\nThe Blue Dog Coalition offered a kind of counterprogramming last Thursday \u2014 timed just hours after the Judiciary Committee\u2019s vote \u2014 with nearly a dozen members taking part in interviews, floor speeches or social media posts to help nudge the narrative away from impeachment and toward the need to safeguard elections.\n\n\u201cI certainly think that the election security elements of the Mueller report have not been given a due amount of coverage and awareness that\u2019s necessary,\u201d Murphy told reporters Thursday, when asked about the event coinciding with the Judiciary vote.\n\nFor months, moderates have sidestepped the slow march toward supporting impeachment within their caucus. But the number of Democratic holdouts has been shrinking, and less than 40 percent of the caucus is now opposed or undecided, many out of deference to Pelosi.\n\nThat only complicates Democrats\u2019 struggle to communicate their agenda to the public.\n\nInternal polling conducted for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in August found that 54 percent of voters nationally think the party\u2019s top focus in Congress is investigating Trump \u2014 though just 10 percent believe that should be the priority.\n\nIn good news for the party, the poll found that Democrats have an 8-point advantage in the generic congressional ballot in 2020, with record enthusiasm ahead of the next election.\n\nStill, it said voters\u2019 perceptions are \u201cnot aligning with the issues voters said were most important for Congress to address,\u201d a perception that has remained unchanged for months, according to a Democratic official familiar with the polling.\n\nAnd some Democrats says they can\u2019t blame the public for the perception.\n\n\u201cIf I wake up every morning and go to bed every night, and look at the TV during the day, and it says impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, investigation. Then what is the American public going to think?\u201d Rep. Tom O\u2019Halleran, co-chair of the House Blue Dog Coalition, said in an interview.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a Beltway process here. \u2018Everything\u2019s about impeachment,\u2019\u201d the Arizona Democrat said, stressing the House\u2019s other work on items like the recent two-year budget deal. \u201cMaybe that message isn\u2019t getting out there in the way it needs to get out there. I know I can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nLaura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "Vulnerable House Democrats fear the party's drive toward impeachment will undercut them in 2020.", "authors": ["Sarah Ferris"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fb/59/4c1669f041218c9e6c747e05827a/190913-pelosi-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
