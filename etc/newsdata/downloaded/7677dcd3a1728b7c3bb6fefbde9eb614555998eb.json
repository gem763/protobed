Prescott threw one interception in last week\u2019s 12-10 loss to New Orleans and has a career-long streak of four straight games with at least one pick.\n\n\u201cThis is not good enough against a bunch like this, last weekend or this weekend,\u201d owner Jerry Jones said. \u201cI accept that. We got to get better. You turn that ball over, you\u2019re not going to beat these good teams in the NFL. They will beat you.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe Cowboys have a good chance to enter Week 6 with the No. 1 offense in the NFL at 453 yards per game, 8 more than Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. Dallas just had its most yards ever in a loss (563), and Prescott had his second 400-yard game of the season with a career-best 463 yards passing.\n\nThe problem for Dallas against the Packers was not being opportunistic early when the game was close. After Cooper\u2019s drop-turned-interception, the Cowboys were in scoring range again when Prescott took a sack that forced a punt. Then his bad interception came with the Cowboys at the Green Bay 35-yard line.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nWhile the final rushing total for Green Bay\u2019s Aaron Jones wasn\u2019t overwhelming at 107 yards (along with a franchise record-tying four touchdowns), he had a stretch of four carries of at least 11 yards in five attempts while the Packers were building a 17-0 halftime lead. The only carry under 11 yards in that span was a 3-yard score.\n\nAfter letting the Saints somewhat dictate the pace with the running game last week, the worst thing for the Cowboys against the Packers was repeatedly letting Jones get outside late after getting gashed inside early. There were plenty of culprits: defensive linemen, linebackers and defensive backs.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nReceiver Michael Gallup is averaging 113 yards receiving per game after another 100-yard game following a two-week absence because of a knee injury sustained in Week 2. He got his first touchdown on a 40-yarder that was the first Dallas TD late in the third quarter. The second-year player is emerging as a significant threat.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nBrett Maher missed two field goals against the Packers, a 54-yarder late in the first half that gave Green Bay a chance to get more points, although the Packers stalled. The second was a PAT-length 33-yarder with the Cowboys playing for a seven-point deficit and a chance at an onside kick inside two minutes.\n\nINJURIES\n\nRT La\u2019el Collins left with a knee injury in the second half after being questionable with a back issue coming into the game. Owner Jerry Jones said it was a medial collateral ligament injury and was optimistic about the prognosis. Dallas also is hopeful six-time Pro Bowl LT Tyron Smith will return after missing a game with a sprained ankle.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\nMinus-5 - The Cowboys\u2018 turnover margin in the two losses, and it\u2019s minus-4 for the season. Dallas has won the turnover battle just once, in the 35-17 win over the Giants in the opener when the Cowboys led 35-10 late in the third quarter.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Cowboys won\u2019t get much credit if they stop their two-game losing streak Sunday at the New York Jets because it could mean three of their four victories are against winless teams. Dallas\u2018 season could turn one way or the other in two weeks at Philadelphia. The Cowboys and Eagles are tied atop the NFC East right now.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Dallas Cowboys started the season with three straight victories against teams that are now a collective 2-12, two of them winless.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/packers_cowboys_football_09148_c0-385-3814-2608_s1770x1032.jpg?50d3455ad9db0b0fb6fb843d57b64a45f8dc0a24", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
