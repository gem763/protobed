A lot in it for the bowlers, a lot in it for the batters, so fantastic test cricket to be played.\n\n\u201cAnd the Indian seam attack was tremendous. Right through the series, relentless and they showed us how to consistently bowl line and length.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s batsmen, who grow up playing on hard and bouncy pitches and are considered more adept at playing fast bowling, looked at sea against the Indian pair of Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav.\n\nDu Plessis lauded the duo for their consistency, something he said the fast bowlers in his side lacked during the series.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the nature of the skill of the bowlers,\u201d the 35-year-old added.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the guys who are successful, especially from their seam attack, it\u2019s the skiddy nature of how they bowl. But it\u2019s that area that they hit the whole time.\n\n\u201cThey hit the top of the stumps relentlessly, and the ball generates pace, sometimes it squats down, a little bit low, but they hit the stumps all the time.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa posted 431 in their first innings in the opening test at Visakhapatnam against India, but crossed the 200-run mark only once in their remaining five innings.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the frustrating part of the tour for us. Starting that first sitting there were some real good signs of things potentially to come, but it went the other way,\u201d du Plessis said. \u201cEvery test match we played we made bit more mistakes.\u201d", "description": "South Africa had prepared for a spin onslaught in India but their batsmen were left flummoxed by the hosts' seam attack, captain Faf du Plessis said after his side's 3-0 defeat in a test series that concluded on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443654471&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0MS-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
