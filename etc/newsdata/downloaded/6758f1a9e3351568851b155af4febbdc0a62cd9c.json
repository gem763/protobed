The S&P 500 slipped 0.08% to 3,036.89. The Nasdaq Composite slid 0.59% to end the day at 8,276.85. The S&P 500 notched a fresh intraday record but mixed earnings and a looming Federal Reserve decision kept investor sentiment in check.\n\nSideways trading\n\nThe major indexes failed to make any major moves on Tuesday despite the S&P 500 making a new all-time high. In fact, the broad index traded in a range of just 0.4% on the day. Strong earnings from pharmaceuticals such as Merck and Pfizer initially helped lift the S&P 500 to an all-time high. However, disappointing results from Google-parent Alphabet offset some of that optimism. Investors also seemed reluctant to make any big moves before the Fed's announcement on Wednesday.\n\nGrubHub and Beyond Meat get crushed\n\nShares of food-ordering service GrubHub plummeted more than 43% on the back of weak earnings and disappointing guidance for the fourth quarter. Beyond Meat shares, meanwhile dropped 22% as Tuesday marked the end of the company's lockup period. This means company insiders can sell their stock for the first time since Beyond Meat's IPO.\n\nWhat happens next?", "description": "The S&P 500 notched a fresh intraday record but mixed earnings and a looming Federal Reserve decision kept investor sentiment in check.", "authors": ["Fred Imbert"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104164091-GettyImages-629334414-1.jpg?v=1572377501", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
