Audrey Lorber was released from custody after the court found her guilty of \"attempting to import marijuana purchased in the U.S. into Russia.\"\n\nLorber, 19, was fined 15,000 rubles ($235), according to a statement released by the press service of St. Petersburg's courts, but was credited for time served, released and exempted from paying the fine.\n\nLorber was required to remain in St. Petersburg for 10 days until the sentence technically comes into force, court officials told CBS News. During that period either Lorber or the government have the right to appeal the ruling, but no appeals were immediately filed.\n\nOnce the 10 days pass, and assuming there are no appeals of her sentence from the prosecution service, Lorber will be allowed to travel back to the U.S.\n\nShe was arrested in late July after arriving in St. Petersburg on vacation with her mother. She was detained at the airport after authorities found about 19 grams of marijuana on her.\n\nA file photo taken inside the terminal at Pulkovo International Airport in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Charges of possession, storing, transporting and selling drugs in Russia are outlined in Article 228 of the Criminal Code, dubbed \"the people's article\" because of its widespread and often controversial implementation by law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn 2018, more than 88,000 people were found guilty of various drug charges, according to Supreme Court data. More than 41% of them were sentenced to prison terms.\n\nEarlier this summer prominent investigative journalist Ivan Golunov was charged with an attempt to sell drugs under the Article 228. Golunov argued the drugs were planted on him; his arrest sparked unprecedented outrage and mass protests in Moscow. Several days after the arrest the charged against him were dropped.", "description": "St. Petersburg court found Audrey Lorber guilty of \"attempting to import\" pot she had a U.S. prescription for, but freed her on time served", "authors": ["Daria Litvinova"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/17/781746fd-ca1c-430b-9a9b-c875b9a26669/thumbnail/1200x630/f6356e0ab179aa86594c357a97d1c1db/st-petersburg-airport-russia-508298424.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
