Now he\u2019ll likely face new questions about his writings in the Harvard Crimson.\n\nTwenty years before the Lauer accusations emerged, while Oppenheim was a student at Harvard University, he wrote a Crimson column railing against NBC\u2019s decision to fire Marv Albert after the sportscaster pleaded guilty to assault in a sex case. (Albert was later re-hired in 2000).\n\n\u201cThe trial was a sham and that the network\u2019s action was an injustice,\u201d Oppenheim fumed in the February 1997 column. He lamented how Albert\u2019s accuser, Vanessa Perhach, was \u201cpermitted to remain shielded in anonymity\u201d while Albert\u2019s sex life faced public probing. Perhach accused the sportscaster of throwing her on a hotel bed, biting her, and forcing her to perform oral sex on him.\n\n\u201cIt is certainly a noble goal to protect the victims of sexual assault from mistreatment in the courtroom,\u201d Oppenheim wrote, \u201cbut why should Marv's past conduct have been subject to the closest scrutiny, while Perhach\u2019s character history have remained off-limits?\u201d\n\nAlthough Albert pleaded guilty, Oppenheim concluded that it was NBC\u2019s actions that were \u201chighly inappropriate.\u201d After all, the future NBC exec dismissively wrote, \u201cAll that we know for sure is that Marv liked his sex a little kinky.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard in 2000, Oppenheim began a career in news at NBC, working on MSNBC shows like Hardball and Scarborough Country, co-creating CNBC\u2019s Mad Money with Jim Cramer, and producing the Today show. He eventually rose up the ranks to senior vice president, overseeing the storied morning show, and in 2017, he was named president of NBC News. Beyond his work in television, Oppenheim wrote the screenplays for Jackie, The Maze Runner, and The Divergent Series: Allegiant.\n\nOppenheim was deeply involved in decisions surrounding Farrow\u2019s investigation of Harvey Weinstein, which NBC chose not to run. Farrow, who took the story to the New Yorker and won a Pulitzer Prize, is dishing about the Weinstein probe and NBC\u2019s handling of the Lauer allegations in his new book.\n\nOver the past several days, excerpts have ignited a firestorm of criticism inside NBC\u2019s prestigious news division. Farrow\u2019s claims\u2014that Oppenheim misled the newsroom about the allegations against Lauer, and dismissively claimed \u201cHarvey Weinstein grabbing a lady\u2019s breasts a couple of years ago, that\u2019s not national news\u201d\u2014have enraged many of the network\u2019s staffers, who demanded answers from network brass.\n\n\u201c All that we know for sure is that Marv liked his sex a little kinky. \u201d \u2014 Noah Oppenheim, 1997\n\nAs such, NBC staffers have also begun to take notice of Oppenheim\u2019s old Crimson musings. Several staffers have passed around his columns, expressing outrage to The Daily Beast at how the executive in charge of handling the Lauer rape claim, as well as shutting down Farrow\u2019s Weinstein expos\u00e9, had displayed questionable attitudes towards women.\n\n\u201cNoah has always run a boys club,\u201d a person who has worked closely with Oppenheim at NBC told The Daily Beast as the columns came to light.\n\nIn one 1998 column that has been circulated among NBC insiders ahead of the release of Farrow\u2019s book, Catch & Kill, Oppenheim gleefully mocked the feminist criticism of Harvard\u2019s male-only final clubs and their rowdy \u201cpunch season\u201d (the equivalent of a fraternity rush) parties.\n\n\u201cMany women argue that the clubs are objectionable because of their demeaning treatment of female guests\u2014particularly the restriction of movement and the sexually aggressive atmosphere,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWomen who fell [sic] threatened by the clubs\u2019 environments should seek tamer pastures.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d Oppenheim concluded, \u201capparently women enjoy being confined, pumped full of alcohol and preyed upon. They feel desired, not demeaned.\u201d\n\nA current staffer who read the column said they wanted to quit.\n\n\u201cOur boss thinks women enjoy being \u2018confined, pumped with alcohol and preyed upon\u2019\u2014those are his own words\u2014and now he runs one of the largest news divisions in America,\u201d the staffer seethed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I work for him. How can this person be president of a network news division?\u201d\n\n\u201c Apparently women enjoy being confined, pumped full of alcohol and preyed upon. They feel desired, not demeaned. \u201d \u2014 Noah Oppenheim, 1998\n\nIn that same late-\u201990s column, the future TV honcho dismissed criticism that the Ivy League\u2019s single-gender social clubs often enabled misogynistic behavior, writing that they served as \u201ca place to let our baser instincts have free reign, to let go of whatever exterior polish we affect to appease female sensibilities.\u201d\n\nAfter attending a 1999 meeting about safe spaces for women on campus, Oppenheim penned a column lamenting the \u201clevel of absurdity that currently defines gender politics at Harvard.\u201d He criticized the women\u2019s groups, including the Coalition Against Sexual Violence, for, in his opinion, not adequately considering the opinions of men when it came to topics including sexual harassment and assault.\n\n\u201cApparently \u2018sexism, sexual harassment and sexual assault\u2019 are women\u2019s issues,\u201d he wrote of what he learned at the meeting. \u201cAdditionally, one speaker indicated that she was concerned about the availability of \u2018emotional support\u2019 for women on campus.\u201d However, Oppenheim added, \u201cBy the end of the night, I must admit that I was rather confused. Surely, sexism, sexual harassment, and sexual assault are issues that belong to everyone. Why are women\u2019s meetings any more deserving of protected space than anyone else\u2019s? And, as for the existence of \u2018emotional support,\u2019 don\u2019t we all need a bit of that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may be time for the feminist activists on this campus to take a little time-out for a good old-fashioned reality check,\u201d Oppenheim concluded. \u201cSome committees, in order [sic] function effectively, have to limit their membership. The overwhelming majority of undergraduate women are not complaining of any rampant discrimination by Harvard. Sexual assault is a matter of public safety, not gender politics. The non-discrimination sword cuts both ways. We all need more meeting space and an occasional hug.\u201d\n\nIn another cringe-worthy column from the year prior, Oppenheim giddily praised the opening of a Hooters breastaurant near campus, declaring that \u201cBy the standards of modern feminism, I am thereby guilty of a most terrible crime. I objectify women.\u201d\n\n\u201c Like most heterosexual men, the sight of a big-busted blonde tickles my fancy. \u201d \u2014 Noah Oppenheim, 1998\n\nWhile other Harvard men \u201cmay pretend to be outraged\u201d by the presence of sexually suggestive restaurant, \u201cfor fear of alienating the real women in their lives,\u201d Oppenheim boasted: \u201cI\u2019ve already made my reservations at Hooters.\u201d He added that \u201cLike most heterosexual men, the sight of a big-busted blonde tickles my fancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I take a hard-earned study break, I like to be greeted by a pretty face,\u201d he concluded, referencing his dorm-room wall decor. \u201cAnd ladies, if any of you have a fetish for bespectacled Jewish boys, I\u2019d be happy to pose for you.\u201d\n\nNBC did not respond to multiple requests for comment.", "description": "Decades before allegedly downplaying a rape claim against Matt Lauer, the NBC News head bashed the network for firing a sportscaster who pleaded guilty in a sex case.", "authors": ["Lachlan Cartwright", "Andrew Kirell", "Maxwell Tani", "Senior Reporter", "Senior Editor", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570757230/191009-Cartwright-tani-Oppenheim-tease_cwnoys", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
