The company, founded by Marc Andreessen, went public in 1995 in an IPO that arguably sparked a revolution and then a bubble in Internet stocks.\n\nAndreessen ambitiously boasted that Netscape would \"reduce Windows to a set of poorly debugged device drivers.\" Microsoft fought back aggressively, leading eventually to an antitrust case.\n\nNetscape CEO James Barksdale testified about one meeting with Microsoft: \"I had never been in a meeting in my 33-year business career in which a competitor had so blatantly implied that we should either stop competing with it or the competitor would kill us.\"\n\nNetscape sold to AOL in 1999, but the browser's source code became the basis of the Mozilla project.", "description": "At the dawn of the Internet age, Microsoft used every trick it knew to dominate the World Wide Web.
