Suburban voters, especially college-educated female voters, strongly disliked President Trump Donald John Trump'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Kayla Mueller's mother: Daughter might still be alive 'If Obama had been as decisive' as Trump MORE and they wanted to send him a message of strong disapproval.\n\nPeter Roskam Peter James RoskamEx-GOP Rep. Roskam joins lobbying firm Blue states angry over SALT cap should give fiscal sobriety a try Illinois Dems offer bill to raise SALT deduction cap MORE, for example, a good campaigner with a strong track record, couldn\u2019t escape Trump\u2019s unpopularity as he went door to door in his wealthy Illinois district. Kevin Yoder Kevin Wayne YoderK Street giants scoop up coveted ex-lawmakers Kansas Senate race splits wide open without Pompeo Mike Pompeo to speak at Missouri-Kansas Forum amid Senate bid speculation MORE, another accomplished incumbent, faced similar headwinds in his suburban Kansas district.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThose districts are not expected to switch back to the GOP this time around, but there are enough other seats, 31 in total, where if Trump repeats his performance from 2016, his Republican team should be able to eke out a narrow majority.\n\nTwenty-five of these seats are an absolute certainty, I am told by a high-ranking House Republican who has looked closely at internal polling.\n\nFor the president and his team, three things have to happen.\n\nFirst, they have to make the most of the Democrats\u2019 foolish foray into impeachment. Impeachment is a further example of partisanship run amok. Suburban voters have practical issues that they are concerned about, from soul-crushing commutes to work to out-of-control college expenses and all issues in between.\n\nThe more time Democrats spend on a partisan fishing expedition, the less time they are tending to the needs of their constituents. This is an opportunity for House Republicans to emphasize how their majority will focus on taking care of problems in their local communities.\n\nSecond, Republicans have to seize back the tax issue. In many districts, especially in New York and New Jersey, the president\u2019s signature tax reform law actually hurt Republicans. Suburban voters in high-tax states actually paid more because the law limited the state and local deductions.\n\nNo matter which candidate gets the Democratic nomination, they have all promised to increase taxes on the wealthy. And suburban voters are smart enough to understand that when Democrats talk about taxing the wealthy, they are talking about taxing them.\n\nThird, Republicans have to find the right balance on cultural and social issues. They need to emphasize that they are both tolerant and traditional. Democrats are nether.\n\nI betcha most Americans didn\u2019t even know the word throuple, before California Democrat Katie Hill Katherine (Katie) Lauren HillThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - ISIS leader dead; Congresswoman resigns Rep. Katie Hill resigns amid ethics probe Trump accuser E. Jean Carroll raises double standard over president, Rep. Hill MORE made it a thing before she resigned this week. A court case in Texas, where a mother wants to medically transition her 7-year-old son into a daughter over the objections of her ex-husband, will most likely become a much bigger political issue. The comments of Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who basically wants to put the Catholic Church out of business, is a further example of the radicalism of the progressive left.\n\nThere is no place for any who hold traditional religious beliefs in the modern Democratic Party and that goes well beyond the abortion issue.\n\nYou can be tolerant and traditional. You just can\u2019t be that in the modern Democratic Party.", "description": "The path back to a House Republican majority runs through America\u2019s suburbs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/suburban_100518istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
