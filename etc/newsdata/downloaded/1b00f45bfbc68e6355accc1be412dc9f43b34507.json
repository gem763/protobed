But it frequently doesn\u2019t work that way, in large part because of the tech companies\u2019 algorithms.\n\nAD\n\nAs the United States has become more politically divided, so, too, have social media users. Because of the ability to follow like-minded users and block those who disagree, people increasingly have the opportunity to find themselves in a social media \u201cfilter bubble.\" Those bubbles can be exacerbated by companies\u2019 algorithms, which tend to recommend joining groups and following other users who agree with you.\n\nAD\n\nBut an echo chamber of voices that agree with you can prove dangerous, researchers say, especially if infiltrated by agents hoping to influence an election.\n\nWhen information bounces through the chamber, few users take the time to determine its origin and assess its truthfulness, said David Levine, an associate professor at the Elon University School of Law in Greensboro, N.C., and the founder of the \u201cHearsay Culture\u201d radio show about modern technology issues.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt can be quite dangerous if you\u2019re not taking a step back and saying, \u2018What do I know about the sources of this information and who or what is behind it?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy psychologically, especially if you\u2019re coming into it with a particular perspective, to go along with it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTwitter declined to comment.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock fell 19 percent as the company reported disappointing results stemming from problems with Twitter\u2019s ad targeting technology. Still, Twitter reported strong user growth Thursday, adding 6 million users over the last quarter, for a total of 145 million.\n\nThe political dangers presented by social media became clear in the wake of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when a Russian-backed group called the Internet Research Agency sowed social discord online in an attempt to interfere with the political process. The organization used a variety of digital disinformation tactics \u2014 including fake accounts posting about divisive issues \u2014 to attack Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and support Republican candidate Donald Trump, who won the election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, Facebook said it removed accounts that appeared to be from the same group that praised Trump and attacked former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential candidate.\n\nSome lawmakers have accused Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg of essentially profiting off disinformation. Lawmakers criticized him at a hearing Wednesday for what they said were insufficient efforts to crack down on state-backed interference, among other issues.\n\nZuckerberg told lawmakers that Facebook\u2019s defenses against disinformation are more \u201csophisticated than any other company has at this point, and frankly, governments, too.\u201d\n\nFacebook did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAD\n\nPew studied more than 1 million tweets posted between June 2018 and July of this year by 2,427 participants with public Twitter accounts. Among users who tweeted about politics, 72 percent strongly disapprove of Trump, 25 percent strongly approve of him and the others had milder opinions on either side.\n\nAD\n\nPew found that there is a higher percentage of U.S. adults on Twitter who strongly disapprove of the president than is reflected in the country\u2019s population. The organization also noted that those who are strongly anti-Trump are also more likely to tweet about national politics than other groups on the site.\n\nConservatives have frequently accused tech giants of exhibiting bias against them. While tech companies say they treat all political content equally, conservatives allege that Silicon Valley\u2019s liberal culture and campaign contributions to Democrats paint a different picture. Trump and other prominent Republicans have repeatedly accused Facebook, Google and Twitter of censoring conservatives or making their content less accessible to the public.\n\nTwitter has also been criticized from the other side of the aisle regarding its refusal to police allegedly rule-breaking content tweeted by Trump.\n\nAD", "description": "Ten percent of U.S. Twitter users are behind 97 percent of tweets that mention national politics, according to a Pew study.", "authors": ["Marie C.
