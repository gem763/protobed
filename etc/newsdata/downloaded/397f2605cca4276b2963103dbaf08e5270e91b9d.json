Today, two of those \u2014 \u201cThink Globally\u201d and \u201cEvery Voice Matters\u201d \u2014 were covered up by employees in the wake of Blizzard\u2019s contentious decision to suspend a Hearthstone pro over his views on Hong Kong.\n\nKevin Hovdestad, who used to work at Blizzard, shared this photograph (which he didn\u2019t take) earlier today:\n\nNot everyone at Blizzard agrees with what happened. Both the \"Think Globally\" and \"Every Voice Matters\" values have been covered up by incensed employees this morning. pic.twitter.com/I7nAYUes6Q \u2014 Kevin Hovdestad (@lackofrealism) October 8, 2019\n\nBlizzard has a set of eight \u201ccore values\u201d that the company says \u201crepresent the principles and beliefs that have guided our company throughout the years. These values are reflected in employees\u2019 decisions and actions every day.\u201d\n\nThey include stuff like \u201cgameplay first\u201d and \u201ccommit to quality\u201d, but the two in question today are:\n\nEVERY VOICE MATTERS: Great ideas can come from anywhere. Blizzard Entertainment is what it is today because of the voices of our players and of each member of the company. Every employee is encouraged to speak up, listen, be respectful of other opinions, and embrace criticism as just another avenue for great ideas.\n\nand\n\nTHINK GLOBALLY Everywhere on the planet there are people who play Blizzard Entertainment games. While respecting the cultural diversity that makes people unique, we strive to grow and support our global gaming community. We also seek the most passionate, talented people in the world to enrich our company and help us forge the future vision of Blizzard Entertainment.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that, in light of their company bowing to the whims of an authoritarian regime and suspending someone who was calling for more democratic rights in his homeland, some Blizzard employees feel like those two values aren\u2019t worth the ground they\u2019re stuck on.", "description": "Blizzard has a set of core values literally enshrined on the ground of their corporate HQ.
