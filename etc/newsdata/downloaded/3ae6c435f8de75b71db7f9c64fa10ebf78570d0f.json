It gave no number.\n\nFacebook last month said it took down accounts linked to an Iranian effort to influence US and British politics with messages about charged topics such as immigration and race relations.\n\nThe social network identified 82 pages, groups and accounts that originated in Iran and violated policy on co-ordinated \"inauthentic\" behaviour.\n\nCulprit identity\n\nGleicher said at the time there was overlap with accounts taken down earlier this year and linked to Iranian state media, but the identity of the culprits has yet to be determined.\n\nPosts on the accounts or pages, which included some hosted by Facebook-owned Instagram, focused mostly on \"sowing discord\" via strongly divisive issues rather than on particular candidates or campaigns.\n\nSample posts shared included inflammatory commentary about US President Donald Trump, British Prime Minister Theresa May and the controversy around freshly appointed US Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Facebook says it blocked some 30 accounts on its platform and 85 more on Instagram after police warned they may be linked to \"foreign entities\" trying to interfere in the US midterm election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8093/a8bd6c4c22b5479286d2a7d1a432c8db.png", "published_at": "2018-11-06"}
