Before Lukaku, the last Inter player to score four or more in his first four away Serie A games was Diego Milito in November 2009 - the season in which Milito led Inter to the Champions League title.\n\nFilip Djuricic and Jeremie Boga scored late for Sassuolo after Inter had gone ahead 4-1.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez each scored twice for Inter Milan but the Nerazzurri struggled defensively in a 4-3 win at Sassuolo on Sunday in Serie A.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/italy_soccer_serie_a_65684_c0-101-2921-1804_s1200x700.jpg?1358769a71777200380fe7aa1e1978e79ad79e0b", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
