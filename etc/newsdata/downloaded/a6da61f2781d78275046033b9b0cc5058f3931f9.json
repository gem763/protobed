But, sadly, many have not learned this lesson. Founding member of \"The Squad\" and socialist Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar announced this week forthcoming legislation titled, \"Homes for All.\" The point of this legislation is supposedly to give a home to every single American. Rep. Omar said it was a \"mortal stain\" on the United States that the nation had homeless people, something that shocked her as a refugee when she first came to America.\n\n\"It is a moral stain on our country that we have half a million or more people facing homelessness, and we have millions of people are living with the stress and the worry of being evicted because they may not be able to pay rent,\" Rep Omar said a \"She The People\" progressive caucus event.\n\n\"In few weeks, we are going to introduce our Homes For All legislation, which will, hopefully, guarantee a home for everyone,\" she said to applause.\n\n.@IlhanMN: \u201cIt is a moral stain on our country that we have half a million or more people facing homelessness ...

It is unclear how much this cost. Here's her, term used as loosely as possible, plan for the legislation:\n\nEstablish a progressive Homes for All program that provides an influx of federal housing funding with the goal of jumpstarting the market and producing 1 million units over 5 years to ensure that no one is denied a healthy home in a livable community\n\n\n\nFully fund the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund, and expand the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to ensure a steady and timely addition of affordable rental units\n\n\n\nFully fund Section 8 vouchers to help the millions of families languishing on the waitlist of assistance and invest in public housing infrastructure in order to address the outrageous backlog of repair needs\n\nHer \"Homes for All\" legislation also calls for a \"Renters' Bill of Rights.\":", "description": ".10/25/2019 17:57:27PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/227/314c3e5d-bd27-41d4-9199-19fb73b20fbc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
