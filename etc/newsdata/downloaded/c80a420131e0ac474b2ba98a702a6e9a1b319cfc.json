Intricate legalities surrounding the decision will be scrutinised in a forensic manner with Scottish courts scheduled to have a substantive hearing on the issue on Tuesday, but in all likelihood this won\u2019t change the current state of play.\n\nGBP Heatmap\n\nDespite all the headlines, the is actually little changed on the week on the whole, falling lower against the USD\n\nHeightened volatility can be expected in the pound in the coming weeks with the currency set to remain highly sensitive to headline risk, with the focus being on the strategy chosen by the opposition in an attempt to take no-deal off the table. Predicting the next political move is inherently risky - as we\u2019ve seen time and again with Brexit - but if pushed to make a forecast, the most likely outcome remains a \u201cnew\u201d deal passing through parliament before October 31st, which in reality would look a lot like the current Withdrawal Agreement with a few twists, including most importantly, a rephrasing of the \u201cbackstop\u201d.\n\nSpeculative positioning in the pound remains pretty extreme on the short side and there\u2019s unsurprisingly been a clear increase in the appetite for protection to downside risks in the options\u2019 market in recent weeks. Having said that, the risks to the pound moving lower are well-versed and widely publicised and given this, there is some logical support behind taking a contrarian position and looking for a recovery in the coming weeks.\n\nset for 2nd consecutive weekly gain\n\nFollowing a testing few weeks for UK blue-chips, the is on course to post a 2nd weekly gain in a row, boosted by a marked improvement in global risk sentiment.\n\nAfter last Friday\u2019s rout and further negative news over the weekend, stock benchmarks began the week on the back foot, but since then there\u2019s been a steady improvement and the is working on a 3rd consecutive day of gains. How markets react to news can often reveal an underlying strength or weakness and the way investors have bought into what could be described as wishful reports of US and China de-escalating their trade war, while seemingly disregarding last week\u2019s additional tariffs is clearly a boon for stock market bulls.\n\nThe summer months are typically volatile with clear trends often lacking, but as we now move into September equities appear well placed to resume their year-to-date gains despite the mounting concerns from not only trade tensions but also inverted yield curves and slowing economies. For how long this is sustainable remains to be seen but for now it seems that the bulls have wrestled back control of the tape.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by XTB (David Cheetham) covering: GBP/USD, FTSE 100.
