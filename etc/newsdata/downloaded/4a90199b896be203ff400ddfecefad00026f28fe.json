After two failed attempts, Mrs. Lam retreated, and she later delivered the speech by video from a protected location.\n\nMrs. Lam, who is under pressure from China\u2019s central government to put an end to the increasingly violent protests that have gone on for more than four months, showed no signs of compromise in her address.\n\n\u201cAny acts that advocate Hong Kong\u2019s independence and threaten the country\u2019s sovereignty, security and development interests will not be tolerated,\u201d she said.", "description": "Carrie Lam, the chief executive, retreated twice from the Legislative Council lectern as pro-democracy lawmakers shouted and demanded her resignation.", "authors": ["Javier C.
