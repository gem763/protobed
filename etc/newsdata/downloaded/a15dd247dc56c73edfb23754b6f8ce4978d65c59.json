Many of the massive new RIAs under construction promise to solve a basic set of challenges. \u201cThey can help a firm monetize (i.e. cash out) after years of building a wealth management practice,\u201d RIAIntel writes. \u201cOr they can bring in fresh tools to help grow a base of clients, and managed assets.\u201d\n\nThe article profiles several of these potential buyers, including Focus Financial Partners , Lovell Minnick Partners, and Emigrant Partners. Each firm has a slightly different approach.\n\nFor example, Focus Financial lays out a fairly mundane set of reasons for selling your practice. It offers to take the managerial aspects of running a business off an advisor or team\u2019s plate, usually for a hefty slice of cash flows. This kind of basic straightforward approach may be just fine for some advisors.\n\nOther massive RIA-focused aggregators offer more specific skill sets to help catalyze growth. Lovell Minnick Partners, for example, has been cobbling together a broad range of financial services firms, not just asset managers, in a bid to create an advanced toolset for advisors at its captive RIA firms.\n\n-- John Kimelman", "description": "Big aggregators have shaken up the business of merging and acquiring.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-106186/social"}
