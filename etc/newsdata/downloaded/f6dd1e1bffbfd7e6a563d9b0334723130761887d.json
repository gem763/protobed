All in an attempt to bypass US sanctions.\n\nMore recently, a report suggested Venezuela\u2018s central bank was looking into whether it could store cryptocurrency in its coffers.\n\nAlthough Maduro\u2018s latest comments are interesting in the context of previous developments, I\u2019m tempted to take them with a pinch of salt.\n\nAfter all, this is coming from a government that won an election amid widespread allegations that international standards of freedom and fairness hadn\u2019t been met.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrency\u2019s potential to bypass US sanctions is undeniable, Maduro should focus on finding a viable long-term solution.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
