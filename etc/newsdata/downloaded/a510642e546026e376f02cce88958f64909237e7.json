It was really difficult.\n\n\"North Koreans wouldn't even make eye contact when I talked to them, not to mention respond.\u201d\n\nThe tetchy encounter in Pyongyang was played with the longstanding backdrop of tensions between the two nations. The two nations are technically still at war, with the 1950-1953 war between the countries halted by a truce, but not a peace treaty.\n\nRelations between the two countries, and their very different ideologies, have been tense ever since, and while there have been moves to try to warm the icy relationship between the two nations, the uneasy relationship still continues.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s handling of the game has come under criticism from the South, with Choi revealing that discussions will take place over a potential complaint being raised with FIFA or the Asian Football Confederation.\n\nBut Swedish ambassador to North Korea Joachim Bergstrom \u2013 one of the few spectators allowed inside the stadium for the match \u2013 shared a video of South Korea striker Son trying to calm down players from both sides, tweeting: \u201cEmotions run high at times.\u201d\n\nNo fighting in front of the kids! Oh, but there are none here today.\ud83e\udd23 Emotions run high at times as #DPRK meets #ROK in #FIFA game - but audience is sparse. pic.twitter.com/HKaoKH89sj \u2014 Joachim Bergstr\u00f6m (@jchmbrgstrm) October 15, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea\u2019s Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul said on Thursday it was \"very disappointing\" that the North did not permit the match to be shown live.", "description": "A South Korea Football Association official said his country\u2019s World Cup qualifier against neighbors North Korea this week was \u201clike war\u201d after the two sides battled out a goalless draw in Pyongyang.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da861f485f540205346d5e1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
