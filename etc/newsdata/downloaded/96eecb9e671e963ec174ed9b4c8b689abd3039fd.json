Recent military actions also led the escape of many ISIS prisoners. On Sunday, amid continued condemnation from lawmakers of the administration\u2019s policy, Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced the last of the U.S. troops will be pulled out of northern Syria.\n\nJust spoke with President @realdonaldTrump.\n\n\n\nI applaud his decision to work with Congress to stop Turkeys aggression in Syria through crippling economic sanctions.\n\n\n\nThis decision by President Trump will be a game changer -- in all the wrong ways -- for Turkey. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 13, 2019\n\nThe White House had threatened Friday to level new sanctions on Turkey for its military actions, but did not immediately enact any. Still, the proposed sanctions weren\u2019t enough for Graham, who days earlier had joined Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland in releasing a bill with suggested sanctions.\n\nGraham, who had told AXIOS that the president was \u201cputting the nation at risk,\u201d called the White House\u2019s conditional sanctions \u201ca tepid response.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Turkish government needs to know Congress will take a different path \u2014 passing crippling sanctions in a bipartisan fashion,\u201d Graham said in a Friday statement.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin responded to Graham\u2019s remarks on ABC, calling the situation \u201ccomplicated\u201d while attempting to reinforce the senator\u2019s close relationship with Trump.\n\n\u201cI like Lindsey Graham a lot, I respect Lindsey,\u201d he said. \u201cLindsey and the president are close. This is obviously an issue that they don\u2019t agree on, and again these are complicated issues.\u201d\n\nCalls for bipartisan action were heeded: Trump tweeted Sunday that he would be dealing with Graham and other lawmakers, \u201cincluding Democrats,\u201d about sanctioning Turkey.\n\n\u201cTreasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThere is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done. Stay tuned!\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9a/74/e87aabe4439dbbec402fe04b2fd0/20191013-turkey-soldier-syria-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
