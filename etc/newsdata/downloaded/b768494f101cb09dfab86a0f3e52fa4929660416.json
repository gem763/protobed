Then there are the takes on its tactics \u2013 too disruptive, too naive or too disrespectful and miles away from the actual concerns of \u201creal people\u201d.\n\nExtinction Rebellion will be assessed and evaluated against criteria its activists did not ask for. Its tactics will be compared and contrasted one against the other, with different strands of the movement categorised accordingly. Good tactics will be those that are lawful, unobtrusive and polite and don\u2019t really get in the way of other people\u2019s daily lives. Whereas lobbying for reform, politely asking politicians to change their priorities, will be judged respectable, but pointless.\n\nIn a hierarchy of need, worrying about the environment is framed by some as a luxury compared with poverty, homelessness and the cuts that austerity has brought across communities. The radicals will be set up against the realists. For some, Extinction Rebellion activists will lose support at the point they transgress the law. For others, the moment that the mass arrests began turned Extinction Rebellion into civil-rights heroes and heroines.\n\nPerhaps instead of this mania for categorising, we can allow all the flowers to flourish.\n\nHistory shows us that it takes many different approaches to make change happen. The tactics that each group chooses are not a matter of personal taste but solutions to a particular problem. Too many years spent failing to make radical change happen can turn energies to smaller, achievable, single-issue campaigns. Conversely, the limits of reform push people and movements to revolt.\n\nCampaigners for homosexual law reform in the late 1950s and 60s, for example, did not see legal change as the end goal. For them, legal change was a route to expose the limits of the law and the structural inequalities beneath it.\n\nFurthermore, what starts as one type of campaign will change in response to its reception. Many activists have changed their feelings about the police or their attitude to violence as a result of personal experiences on a demonstration.\n\nExtinction Rebellion has an impressive family tree. It might be a dysfunctional family, but diversity and incoherence can be a strength. In the 50s and 60s, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament\u2019s mass meetings and marches brought together pacifists, priests, communists, anarchists, the Labour movement (sometimes), undercover civil servants, war veterans and students. Alongside long-time pacifists, \u201cmiddle-class radicals\u201d, as the sociologist Frank Parkin called them, produced new identities for themselves as they went to meetings, came up with slogans and wore their CND badges with pride. They were the generation who had supposedly benefited from postwar affluence and used those benefits to bite the hand that fed them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest CND\u2019s protests brought together pacifists, priests, communists, anarchists, war veterans and students.

Living collectively, Greenham women turned the domestic \u2013 the basics of everyday eating, sleeping, cooking \u2013 into a political act. Greenham women performed their domestic politics collectively and very publicly. Like the Reclaim the Night marches taking place against sexual violence and harassment on the streets around the same time, Greenham saw women taking up space as a political act in itself.\n\nGreenham recognised that unity was built from many strands. Different camps around the base were named after colours of the rainbow. Each signalled an identity. Turquoise Gate camp was more new age and vegan, while Violet was more connected to organised religion. The coloured gates represented the elements of building a utopian community.\n\nMaybe the most radical act of all is to accept that other people\u2019s tactics are not the problem. Different approaches \u2013 mass arrests, blockades, citizens\u2019 assemblies, carnivals \u2013 are all ways to imagine a different world, a world in which young people are taken seriously rather than managed.\n\nYouth is also a political tactic, publicly associated with Greta Thunberg and triggered for many by the wave of school strikes. But this is more than a generational coincidence \u2013 it is a tactical match with the movement\u2019s goal. Childhood and youth combine the practicality of having energy and time to act with a symbolism that is simultaneously innocent and rebellious while embodying the future.\n\nA generation that has been derided as apathetic, selfie-obsessed consumers has walked out of schools and colleges and taken over the streets, using social media channels to fill the gaps in mainstream media coverage. This generation\u2019s life cycle maps the trajectory of environmental decline. For these activists, the ecological threat is no longer set in an abstract future \u2013 it will be in their lifetime.\n\nExtinction Rebellion has learned some useful lessons from the past. It has also reanimated adults who have been there before, at Greenham, in the anarcho-punk and free party scenes, at anti-road protests, as well as more recent campaigns against fracking.\n\nAll of these, like Parkin\u2019s middle-class radicals, sought to protect the world rather than defend their material interests \u2013 perhaps because they didn\u2019t need to, perhaps because they had no choice. One thing that the outgrown activists could help with is some honest advice: \u201cWhatever you do, it will be wrong\u201d and: \u201cDon\u2019t do what you are told\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Lucy Robinson is professor in collaborative history at Sussex University", "description": "Extinction Rebellion draws on a radical lineage that brings together a range of beliefs and ages", "authors": ["Lucy Robinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b8a553a72bbacd4643c5145dd5d5463b05ecca1/0_238_3984_2390/master/3984.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0c158055ca440f80b729c7ae84408351", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
