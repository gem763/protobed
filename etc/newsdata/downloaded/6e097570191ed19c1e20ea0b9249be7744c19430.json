Yes, finally, the House had come together to back an EU exit deal.\n\nThis was a breakthrough moment \u2013 an extraordinary achievement considering the Tories' former allies in the DUP weren't even supporting the deal.\n\nHowever, it was the subsequent vote which brought everything to a screeching halt.\n\nThe PM had lost by 14 votes. Not a Theresa May-size spanking but a victory for the anti-Brexit brigade all the same. Huge groans as the tellers announced the result echoed around the chamber.\n\nRising to his feet, Boris (pictured) somehow managed to smear a positive expression across his face. Yes, finally, the House had come together to back an EU exit deal\n\nJohnson brushed away Jeremy Corbyn's offer to work on a timetable, pledging to put his Bill on pause until he had heard from Brussels about an extension. Utterly maddening. But that's always been the problem of getting Brexit done.\n\nNo wonder Boris then slumped in his seat, shoulders drooped, eyes gazing down emptily into space, his head hung heavily like a despondent mule. Here sat one disappointed hombre.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel perched beside him in come hither spectacles, offering what seemed consoling words. Boris remained mightily peeved.\n\nAnd to think for a brief moment, Boeing Boris had been taxi-ing on the runway. The seat-belt signs had been on. Throttle humming, the control tower had cleared lift-off.\n\nThe PM had opened the day's debate with a minor masterclass in amateur dramatics. Planted questions rained in from all corners as he sought to assuage MPs' reservations.\n\nCaroline Flint (Lab, Don Valley) asked if environmental concerns would be written into the Bill. 'Sure,' said Boris. How about workers' rights? pondered Rosie Cooper (Lab, West Lancs). 'I don't see why not.' Perhaps, suggested Jim Fitzpatrick (Lab, Poplar and Limehouse), there might be something on consumer rights, too? 'No problem!'\n\nAcross the dispatch box, Jeremy Corbyn scribbled notes furiously as each of his attack lines were robbed from him. Jo Johnson (Con, Orpington), who flounced out of Cabinet last month, congratulated his brother on securing a deal.\n\nThis was a breakthrough moment \u2013 an extraordinary achievement considering the Tories' former allies in the DUP weren't even supporting the deal\n\n'I never doubted him for a minute!' Raucous laughter. The interventions kept coming. 'Will he give way? Will he give way? Will he give way?'\n\nThe noise was like a cloud of chirping grasshoppers.\n\nTwo Tory turncoats, Phillip Lee (Lib Dem, Bracknell) and Sam Gyimah (Lib Dem, East Surrey), were pointedly ignored.\n\nIain Duncan Smith (Con, Chingford & Woodford Green) wanted to know if, under any new trade agreement, Northern Ireland would be treated the same as, say, Kent? 'I can give exactly that assurance,' Boris replied heartily.\n\nVicky Ford (Con, Chelmsford) helpfully suggested that should MPs fail to back a deal, they risked a No Deal Brexit. Boris retorted: 'My Honourable friend is absolutely right!'\n\nCaroline Lucas (Green, Brighton Pavilion) wanted an assurance that we wouldn't crash out of the EU at the end of the transition period without a deal if a trade agreement hadn't been secured.\n\nbrexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.\n\nBut we will get a trade agreement, the PM bellowed \u2013 a brilliant agreement! Cheers erupted from behind. Lucas pulled a crab apple grimace. Tommy Sheppard (SNP, Edinburgh E) gave the PM a dismissive 'och, get on wi' yers' wave of the hand.\n\nIn response, Corbyn said little of note. His oratory can decompressurise the chamber within seconds. Emergency oxygen masks ought to drop from the ceiling whenever he rises.\n\nOpposite him, Sir Desmond Swayne (Con, New Forest West) was a haphazard pile of limbs. Ken Clarke (Con, Rushcliffe) slouched so deeply in his seat that a pint pot could have balanced on his belly. Several early Labour interventions suggested the PM's bill might just pass.\n\nBoth Lisa Nandy (Lab, Wigan) and Gloria De Piero (Lab, Ashfield) warned Corbyn they would be voting with the Government. Jim Fitzpatrick demanded assurances that anyone who followed suit would not be whip removed. Interestingly, Corbyn wouldn't give them.\n\nAt one point, the interventions all got too much for him. 'There are so many people trying to intervene. Can I just deal with you one of a time, thank you!' he yelled. Some members erupted into classroom titters. Jezza was having an eggy.\n\nHis mood hardly improved when Steve Baker (Con, Wycombe) reminded him of the time when they were interviewed together and both agreed that the UK should leave the EU.\n\nAfter SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford moaned about the length of time MPs were being given to debate the Bill, Stephen Kerr (Con, Stirling) accused him of causing a 'stooshie.' Great word, stooshie. It's a Scots term for fracas.\n\nThere may be many more stooshies to come, I fear.", "description": "HENRY DEEDES: Rising to his feet, Boris somehow managed to smear a positive expression across his face.
