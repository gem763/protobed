He then installed hardware-based keyloggers that recorded the usernames and passwords of the companies\u2019 employees. He also installed laptops in the companies\u2019 networks that he used to remotely access the compromised employee accounts. Agarwal also used his unauthorized access at one of the companies to create a fraudulent employee badge that allowed him continued access to the company\u2019s premises.\n\nThe New Jersey man created a programming script designed to exfiltrate data. He used it against multiple computers to steal more than 15,000 files relating to the companies\u2019 emerging data, human resources data, employees\u2019 personal information, and email. Among the multiple employees who were targeted were a chief network engineer officer and a network engineer. The crimes began in February 2017 and came to an end around April 2018, when network security employees for one of the companies detected the intrusion and began an investigation.\n\nAgarwal pleaded guilty to two counts of obtaining information from computers and one count of aggravated identity theft. He faces up to 12 years in prison and $750,000 in fines or twice the gain or loss of his offenses. He will also be required to pay restitution and to surrender computer gear. Sentencing is scheduled for January 28. A court document is here and a federal prosecutor release is here.", "description": "Ankur Agarwal admits to stealing secrets the old-fashioned way: with physical trespass.", "authors": ["Dan Goodin"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/prison-bars-640x215.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
