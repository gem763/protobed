In comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% closed down 0.1%, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.19% rose 0.2%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.81% advanced 0.8%, and the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, +2.47% closed up 2.5%.\n\nIntel\u2019s largest segment \u2014 client-computing, the traditional PC group \u2014 came in at $9.7 billion, while analysts expected $9.6 billion from the year-ago period.\n\nIntel expects adjusted earnings of $1.24 a share on revenue of about $19.2 billion in the fourth quarter. For the year, Intel hiked its outlook to adjusted earnings of $4.60 a share on revenue of about $71 billion for the year. Analysts had forecast $1.21 a share on revenue of $18.83 billion for the fourth quarter, and $4.39 a share on revenue of $69.44 billion for the year.\n\n\u201cWe expect our second-half PC client supply will be up double-digits compared to the first half and we expect to further increase our PC client supply by mid-to-high single-digits in 2020, but that growth hasn\u2019t been sufficient,\u201d Swan said. \u201cWe\u2019re letting our customers down and they\u2019re expecting more from us.\u201d\n\n\u201cPC demand has exceeded our expectations and surpassed third-party forecasts,\u201d Swan said. \u201cWe now think the market is stronger than we forecasted back in Q2, which has made building inventory buffers difficult. We are working hard to regain supply/demand balance but we expect to continue to be challenged in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nThe company reported third-quarter net income of $5.99 billion, or $1.35 a share, compared with $6.4 billion, or $1.38 a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings were $1.42 a share. Revenue rose to $19.19 billion from $19.16 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast earnings of $1.23 a share on revenue of $18.05 billion.\n\nThe company also said its board approved another $20 billion in stock buyback authorization.", "description": "Intel Corp. shares rallied in the extended session Thursday after the chip giant\u2019s quarterly results and outlook topped Wall Street estimates and data-center...", "authors": ["Wallace Witkowski"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GM743_intel__ZG_20180718150435.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
