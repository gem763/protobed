He\u2019ll be on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d to discuss his master plan to confiscate the 16 million AR-15s in circulation in the United States and to answer uncomfortable questions about whether he didn\u2019t just wreck the push for background checks in Congress. He\u2019ll be followed by Cory Booker, who\u2019s joined Beto\u2019s call for a mandatory buyback program based on a 1980s gun control law that Booker seems not to understand. And Pete Buttigieg will drop by \u201cThis Week\u201d and \u201cState of the Union\u201d amid a decline in the polls that\u2019s at risk of pushing him into the second tier, particularly if O\u2019Rourke regains a little of his early momentum from his confiscation push.\n\nIf Democratic bickering doesn\u2019t grab you, how about Republican bickering? Superhawk Liz Cheney and superdove Rand Paul spent the better part of this week throwing roundhouses at each other on Twitter over foreign policy, with each eager to kiss Trump\u2019s ass in hopes of influencing the president\u2019s views going forward. Cheney has special reason to try to earn Trump\u2019s favor since she may run for Senate in Wyoming to replace the retiring Mike Enzi and knows that an unkind word from the president would damage her chances in the primary. She\u2019ll be on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d after O\u2019Rourke and Booker while Paul will sit down with \u201cState of the Union\u201d to extend their feud from social media to television. How the hell will these two coexist in the Senate Republican caucus if Cheney runs for Enzi\u2019s seat and wins? Stay tuned.\n\nAlso worth watching this morning \u2014 and this may be first and last time you\u2019ll hear me say this \u2014 is Adam \u201cPencil Neck\u201d Schiff, who\u2019ll be on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Schiff\u2019s TV segments can normally safely be skipped but something\u2019s brewing in the House Intelligence Committee about a mysterious whistleblower complaint that was recently filed with the director of national intelligence. That complaint may or may not involve the president. The DNI is supposed to refer whistleblower complaints to Congress for investigation, but for the moment acting DNI Joseph Maguire hasn\u2019t done so. Schiff is demanding to know why. He\u2019ll fill in some of the blanks about the complaint in his interview this morning. And if you tune in for that, stick around for Ilhan Omar later in the show talking about God knows what. 9/11, probably. What could go wrong?\n\nOne more note: Ted Cruz will be on \u201cThis Week\u201d to insist that any Republican compromise on gun rights will result in a Democrat being elected next fall and (maybe) to reiterate his interest in running for president again in 2024, which he confirmed at an event a few days ago. Can you imagine the anguish the poor guy\u2019s going to experience when he ends up losing to Don Jr in the primaries this time?
