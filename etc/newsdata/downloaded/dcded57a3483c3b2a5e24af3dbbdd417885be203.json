I feel, if we improve as a team, I'll be a success too.'\n\nMaguire has slotted into the United defence seamlessly, and has played every minute of every Premier League game thus far.\n\nIrrespective of the hefty fee on Maguire's head, the 26-year-old said that his \u00a380million world-record fee for a defender doesn't bother him in the slightest.\n\n'It doesn't bother me at all,' he said. 'It's something that I can't affect. Leicester wanted to keep me and they are in a great position as a club.\n\n'Manchester United wanted to buy me and they came to an agreement. It's probably a good deal for both parties and it's something now where I want to concentrate on my football.'\n\nMaguire is currently on international duty with England, who play Czech Republic in Prague on Friday and Bulgaria in Sofia on Monday in two Euro 2020 qualifiers.\n\nBut United welcome Premier League leaders Liverpool after the international break, on October 20 at Old Trafford, in a crunch match for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team.", "description": "Maguire, who signed from Leicester City in the summer, believes the team will improve.
