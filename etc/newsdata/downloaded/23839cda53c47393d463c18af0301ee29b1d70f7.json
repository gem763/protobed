Like most Google Doodles, it\u2019s to celebrate the birthday of a person who moved the world forward, namely Belgian physicist Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau, who\u2019s often credited with inventing the device.\n\nBut strangely, Google\u2019s own description fails to mention that Plateau isn\u2019t the only one who invented the phenakistiscope. It\u2019s one of history\u2019s famous cases of simultaneous invention, where Austrian professor Simon Stampfer was simultaneously studying the same optical illusion, including descriptions of that illusion from British scholar Peter Mark Roget and a specific mechanical example of that illusion published by the famed British scientist Michael Faraday. (Roget may have built some phenakistiscopes in private too.) There\u2019s a heck of a Wikipedia article about it that points back to some of their original writings, and I also liked this 14-page article at JSTOR.\n\nGoogle\u2019s animations also don\u2019t necessarily do justice to the intricacy of the original Victorian-era illusions \u2014 some of which are still a sight to behold:\n\nAll that aside, Google says it\u2019s doing something unique to celebrate Plateau: the company says it\u2019s the first Doodle with different artwork across desktop, mobile, and its dedicated search app. See below, or try it out for yourself on your own device.", "description": "Today, Google\u2019s logo at Google.com has been replaced with an animation representative of animation itself \u2014 a modern artist\u2019s interpretation of the phenakistiscope, a spinning disc invented in 1833 that\u2019s considered one of the precursors to modern cinema.
