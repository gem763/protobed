Brent crude prices jumped by about $12 just after trading opened Monday, representing a nearly 20% price spike, as traders mulled a major supply disruption in the key oil producing region.\n\nHere were the main moves in the market ahead of the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange:\n\nS&P 500 futures (ES=F): -0.36%, or 10.75 points\n\nDow futures (YM=F): -0.36%, or 99 points\n\nNasdaq futures (NQ=F): -0.63%, or 49.75 points\n\nU.S. crude oil prices (CL=F): +10.01% to $60.34 points\n\n10-year Treasury yield (^TNX): +5.8 bps to 1.841%\n\nGold (GC=F): +0.81% to $1,511.70 per ounce\n\nDrones strikes descended on two Saudi Arabian oil facilities on Saturday, knocking out 5.7 million barrels per day of production, or about 5% of global output. This was the single worst disruption in oil markets ever, exceeding both the impact from the Kuwaiti and Iraqi petroleum supply loss in 1990 during the Gulf War, as well as the oil crisis spurred by an Iranian output loss in the wake of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nSaturday\u2019s attacks led President Donald Trump on Sunday to authorize a release of crude from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), in a move to offset the expected hit to supply. The SPR contains over 700 million barrels, and was last tapped in 2011 due to supply disruptions in Libya.\n\nHouthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attacks on Saturday. The military spokesperson for the group said 10 drones targeted Saudi Aramco oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais.\n\nHowever, Trump administration officials have since pinned the strikes on Iran, which sponsors the Houthi rebels. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a Twitter post that \u201cIran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply,\u201d and that \u201cThere is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\u201d Iran has denied it was responsible for the raids.\n\nTrump followed up with a Twitter post on Sunday saying, \u201cThere is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!\u201d\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S. (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid) More\n\nHaven assets rallied Monday as investors weighed the prospects of a wider conflict, with the U.S. having already blamed Iran as the culprit behind a series of attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz \u2013 a major oil transportation hub \u2013 earlier this year. Gold, the Japanese yen and Swiss franc each rallied. The 10-year Treasury yield, which often moves in the same direction as crude oil prices, instead fell on Monday as investors poured into less risky government debt.\n\nMeanwhile, transportation, airline and cruise operating companies\u2019 stocks fell amid the rise in oil prices. Carnival Cruise Lines\u2019 (CCL) stock was off 3%, while Royal Caribbean Cruises\u2019 (RCL) fell 2% during premarket trading. Shares of Delta Airlines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) were each down more than 3%.\n\nThe Saudi oil disruption has also thrust focus to the energy sector, which has been both a laggard to the S&P 500 this year and a sector carrying relatively little weight in the index overall. The energy sectors has risen 5.6% this year through Friday\u2019s close, versus a gain of nearly 20% for the S&P 500.\n\n\u201cAs unexpected as the weekends events were, to us it is more of a wake-up call about the Energy sector than a sign that macro investment narratives are about to change dramatically,\u201d Nicholas Colas and Jessica Rabe, DataTrek co-founders, wrote in a report Monday.", "description": "U.S. stock futures tumbled and oil surged after attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities over the weekend led to massive supply disruptions out of one of the world\u2019s largest oil producing centers.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.FH0P288GZEQPmtY5vuzkA--~B/aD00MjgyO3c9NjQyMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/e77f75d0-d4b5-11e9-9ffb-56c17818b883", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
