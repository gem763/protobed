And while on the job, Kelly had his own controversies that did not shine a positive light on the administration. In October, 2017 Kelly not only called Florida Democratic congresswoman Frederica Wilson an \u201cempty barrel\u201d after she was critical of the president, he went on to lie about the congresswoman during a press conference and, when caught, refused to apologize.\n\nKelly told a story about Wilson boasting about securing $20 million in funding to build a new FBI field office in Miami while at a 2015 dedication ceremony for the building. When video surfaced proving Kelly had made up the story, reporters asked him if he\u2019d apologize, and Kelly said, \u201cOh, no. No. Never. Well, I\u2019ll apologize if I need to. But for something like that, absolutely not. I stand by my comments.\u201d\n\nAlso, in May of 2018 Kelly caught heat for racist comments he made towards immigrants. And then on his way out the door in December 2018, during an exit interview, Kelly admitted that things at the White House were in disarray, and he attempted to distance himself from some unpopular policies put forth by the administration.\n\nAdditionally, Kelly was perceived as grossly mishandling accusations of domestic physical and emotional abuse by White House staffer Rob Porter, lying about when he found out about the allegations and what details he knew.\n\nIn the recent interview, the retired four-star general and Trump\u2019s former homeland security secretary also weighed in on the president\u2019s decision to vacate northern Syria, abandoning the US\u2019s alliance with Kurdish fighters. Kelly told the Examiner that Trump\u2019s policy was a \u201ccatastrophically bad idea\u201d because the Kurds were crucial to keeping ISIS contained, along with helping minimize American casualties in the region.\n\n\u201cWhat was working in Syria was that for very little investment, the Kurds were doing all the fighting, the vast majority of the dying, and we were providing intelligence and fire support assistance. And we were winning,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
