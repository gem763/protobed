They ignored the Third District, where state Rep. Greg Murphy swamped Democrat Allen Thomas with nearly 60 percent of the vote to fill the seat of the late Rep. Walter Jones, who died in February.\n\nMentioning the landslide Republican victory in the Third would have tarnished the media\u2019s main point, which was the closeness of the race in the Ninth, where President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence campaigned for Mr. Bishop the day before.\n\nSo, the fake news narrative is that \u201cTrump is in trouble.\u201d It\u2019s a done deal, folks. Time to lay out some early money in Vegas for whomever the Democrats nominate in 2020.\n\nReporting on the landslide Republican win in the Third District would have spoiled this happy narrative. By the way, Dr. Murphy is the only M.D. in the North Carolina legislature, which makes him even more worthy of being ignored by the media at a time when Democrats are calling for socialist health care.\n\nThe do-over election in the Ninth was held because of possible vote fraud in 2018 by the \u2014 wait for it \u2014 GOP. Talk about a man bites dog story. Anyway, Republican Mark Harris outpolled Mr. McCready by 905 votes, with a Libertarian candidate skimming off 5,130, and the election results were set aside.\n\nFast forward to Sept. 10. Although Mr. McCready had much more than a year\u2019s worth of public recognition because of his earlier run, Mr. Bishop beat him by about 4,000 votes, quadrupling Mr. Harris\u2019 margin. Not bad for someone who entered the race only months before.\n\nAnother misleading media story line is that Republicans have held this district since 1963. No, they haven\u2019t. Until 2016, this district was based almost entirely in Mecklenburg County or in a few counties running north from Mecklenburg (Charlotte). The current Ninth District runs from Mecklenburg to the east through Union, Anson, Stanley, Hoke, Robeson and Cumberland (Fayetteville and home of Ft. Bragg) counties.\n\nBoth parties and outside groups poured money into the race, which cost a total of $10.7 million, according to the Charlotte Observer. \u201cIt was seen as high stakes by both sides,\u201d said North Carolina Family Policy Council President John Rustin.\n\nMr. McCready ran as a moderate Democrat, but he had the backing of Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign (the largest LGBTQ pressure group), Mr. Rustin said. They are not exactly known for moderation in their pursuit of unlimited abortion and sexual anarchy.\n\nSpeaking of moderation, it\u2019s getting harder and harder for Democrats to pose as moderates when the leaders of their party keep going off the rails.\n\nRobert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke, who seems to get kookier by the day, wants the government to dictate where people live so that poor people can be near rich people. Bernie Sanders wants taxpayers to assume all medical debt in the nation, and praised China\u2019s Communist government for its economic policies. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris support Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d which would eliminate private health insurance.\n\nMs. Warren also wants the government to take over management of large corporations and has announced that she\u2019d issue an order halting fracking for oil and gas. Ms. Warren, wouldn\u2019t that send America\u2019s energy industry and the economy into a tailspin?\n\nTo which she might answer, \u201cand your point is?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s something the media might not want to explore: The Democrats\u2019 playbook is almost indistinguishable from that of the Communist Party USA. This isn\u2019t name-calling; it\u2019s fact checking.\n\nLike the CPUSA, the Democrats promote class warfare, open borders, legalizing \u201cundocumented immigrants,\u201d free college tuition, free daycare, a government takeover of health care, extreme environmentalism, taxpayer-funded abortion, the LGBTQ agenda, abolishing the Electoral College and condemning America as a uniquely racist nation. Surprisingly, the CPUSA\u2019s platform makes no mention of guns, but history informs us that confiscation occurs quickly when Communists take power.\n\nRight now, suburban voters, including Republican women who dislike Mr. Trump\u2019s personality and shady past, are supposedly up for grabs. But when faced with a vote for Mr. Trump or a vote for Bernie, Liz, Kamala or fake moderate Joe Biden, they may see a clearer choice.\n\nOne more thing. Newly elected Congressman Bishop had sponsored the state\u2019s so-called \u201cbathroom bill\u201d that required people to use restrooms based on their biological sex. Although liberals led boycotts and got a policy reversal, Mr. Bishop\u2019s family values did not appear to hurt him. He was also endorsed by the National Rifle Association and repeatedly linked his opponent to the Democratic Party\u2019s far-left wing.\n\nThe Communist Party USA\u2019s issue platform is called \u201cThe Road to Socialism.\u201d Its website summarizes its appeal: \u201cFor democracy. For equality. For socialism. For a sustainable future and a world that puts people before profits.\u201d\n\nHow is that different from what the Democrats are selling? The media\u2019s silence is the sound of one hand clapping.\n\n\u2022 Robert Knight is a contributor to The Washington Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
