This is an unacceptable lack of communication on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OC_Transpo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@OC_Transpo</a>\u2019s part. <a href=\"https://t.co/p2U2ugWq5h\">https://t.co/p2U2ugWq5h</a> \u2014@sarahmeaghang\n\n\"There's not a lot of trust left in the transit system, and as a result I think that if we continue with this lack of communication we will see a further erosion in the ridership numbers,\" Wright-Gilbert said.\n\nCommunications protocol\n\nNow, she's asking OC Transpo to provide commissioners with a detailed overview of their communications protocol for LRT delays.\n\nIt's been two weeks since the much-anticipated Confederation Line opened to the public. During construction, transit users became fed up with bus cancellations and breakdowns as the aging fleet chugged toward the light rail finish line.\n\n\"The public have put up with a lot,\" Wright-Gilbert said. She noted that during the first significant LRT delay, which occurred the first Tuesday after the launch, OC Transpo did a great job of updating customers.\n\nBlair station along Ottawa's Confederation Line. (Andrew Lee/CBC)\n\nWright-Gilbert said the topic of the communication surrounding the Sept. 17 delay arose at a recent transit commission meeting, but the feeling was there had been an overload of confusing information. In the case of Thursday's delay, things have swung too far the other way, she said.\n\n\"They're not communicating anything, and that leaves customers frustrated, and to be honest with you, not trusting in the system,\" she said.\n\nOC Transpo acknowledges delay\n\nIn a statement attributed to Pat Scrimgeour, OC Transpo\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b's director of transit customer systems and planning, he said: \"We recognize that in this instance there was a delay in issuing the alerts via social media and our website.\" However, Scrimgeour said passengers at stations and on trains were provided with \"the most up-to-date information\" during the delay.\n\nThe transit agency \"will continue to work to improve our communications and ensure alerts are communicated to customers as soon as possible,\" he said.\n\nWright-Gilbert's formal commissioner's inquiry is expected to be discussed at the next meeting of the transit commission on Oct. 16.", "description": "A citizen member of Ottawa's transit commission is concerned\u00a0OC Transpo's\u00a0handling of communications surrounding LRT delays will erode public trust in the\u00a0new system.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5285397.1568654035!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/st-laurent-station-ottawa-confederation-line-line-1-lrt-o-train.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
