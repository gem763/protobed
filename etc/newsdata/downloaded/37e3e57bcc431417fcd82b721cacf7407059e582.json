Rightmove is a mission critical tool for them. They are more likely to turn the lights off before giving up their Rightmove subscription.\u2019\n\nThe company has been one of the fund\u2019s best performing stocks, with its share price leaping about 1,500 per cent since purchased in 2009. Thomson trawls the world for this kind of opportunity \u2013 where a company starts off under the radar.\n\nMany of the firms that he likes best generate growth using technology. About a quarter of the portfolio is made up of such technology holdings. Another tech favourite among the fund\u2019s 60 stocks is Match Group, the US firm that finds love for \u2018lonely hearts\u2019 through its empire of dating apps including Match.com, Tinder and PlentyofFish.\n\nThomson recognises this is a volatile market but is reassured by management efforts to add premium services.\n\nHe says: \u2018Successful businesses in technology do not just put up prices. They need to give their customers something more. Tinder lets everyone \u201cswipe right\u201d for those matches they like the look of. But it also offers a Gold members-only service that allows access to features such as one that narrows the field to those people who have already \u201cswiped right\u201d for you.\u2019\n\nHe also \u2018weather-proofs\u2019 the portfolio with defensive stocks that may grow less quickly, which are vital in an era of \u2018unreliable growth\u2019, he says. These include companies involved in care homes, medical equipment and healthcare.\n\nRecession \u2018ballast\u2019 should be provided by the US pawn shop business First Cash. He says: \u2018Pawn shops do not prey on their customers. It is a clear transaction. You bring in your guitar and they value it real time and then give you 60 per cent of that value. Three quarters of people come back for their item and the typical interest rate works out at 14 per cent.\u2019\n\nAnother \u2018ballast\u2019 stock is Waste Connections, one of the largest US rubbish collection companies. He says: \u2018Garbage collection is done privately in the US. Even in a recession people want their garbage collected.\u2019\n\nThe fund\u2019s global flavour has transformed since Britain\u2019s Brexit vote. Back in 2016, about a quarter of the portfolio was in the UK \u2013 now it is just 5 per cent. About two thirds are now in US stocks \u2018where the growth is\u2019.\n\nThomson has a track record of picking winners. Over the past five years, the \u00a31.8billion fund has delivered a return of 120 per cent, compared with 66 per cent for the average global fund and 31 per cent for the FTSE All-Share.\n\nCharges of 0.78 per cent a year are competitive. Patrick Connolly, of adviser Chase de Vere, says: \u2018The manager\u2019s skills have produced excellent long-term returns for investors.\u2019", "description": "Downbeat chatter about the state of the UK housing market has not dimmed enthusiasm for property website Rightmove at least not for Rathbone fund manager James Thomson", "authors": ["Sally Hamilton For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
