Two of those killed were children, he added, tears rolling down his cheeks.\n\n\"The guide was trying to save my nephew and they both slipped and were swept away by the floods,\" he said. \"For more than an hour the rest of us held tight before the water subsided and we managed to walk to safety.\"\n\nThe bodies of those swept away were later found some 30 km from the scene, KWS Central Rift Assistant Director Aggrey Maumo told reporters.\n\nThe park is famous for its gorges, cliffs and steam plumes from geothermal activity underground, and in areas adjacent to it, the steam is harnessed to generate electricity.\n\nThe park has also been used as a location for films such as \"Tomb Raider II:Cradle of Life\", the Kenya Film Commission says.\n\nGorges in the park are prone to flash floods and have in the past killed visitors. In 2012, floods killed seven who were part of a church group on a trek.\n\n\"We will not close the gorges ... This (accident) should not deter anyone from visiting this park,\" he added.\n\nA local community leader blamed the accident on the impact of human activities on the environment. Environmental degradation, mainly due to charcoal burning, has eroded the natural habitat, said Maenka Ole Kisotu.\n\n\"There is no vegetation here and once it rains the floods sweep anything on the way,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by George Obulutsa and Humphrey Malalo in Nairobi; editing by Darren Schuettler and Gareth Jones)", "description": "HELL'S GATE NATIONAL PARK, Kenya (Reuters) - Flash floods killed six family members and their tour guide at Kenya's Hell's Gate National Park, the state-run wildlife authority said on Monday.
