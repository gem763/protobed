Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed responsibility, but the United States blamed Iran. President Donald Trump said Washington was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to retaliate.\n\nThe Norwegian crown surged to 8.9215 per dollar and then settled at 8.9695 crowns NOK=D3, up 0.2% on the day. It was last 0.3% ahead versus the euro EURNOK=D3.\n\nThe Canadian dollar rose 0.2% to C$1.3264 CAD=D3 after earlier reaching C$1.3208. The Russian rouble RUB= was 0.5% higher.\n\nThe currencies of oil importers such as Turkey TRY= and India INR= weakened.\n\nOverall, the forex market reaction was limited. A bigger concern was that a supply-side shock and growing geopolitical tensions would damage an already fragile global economy, MUFG analyst Lee Hardman said.\n\n\u201cDownside risks for the global economy would intensify if geopolitical risks in the region continued to escalate, creating a more unfavorable environment for high beta emerging market and high yielding currencies,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Japanese yen, a common choice for investors seeking shelter from market uncertainty, rose 0.4% to 107.71 yen per dollar JPY=EBS.

That added to pressure for stimulus, and in offshore trade the Chinese yuan CNH=EBS weakened 0.3% to 7.0653 per dollar.\n\nThe market focus on Monday was the Middle East, but attention will also remain on central bank meetings in the United States and Japan, which follow the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus package announced last week.\n\nInvestors expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates on Wednesday FEDWATCH and will be looking for signals on further easing.
