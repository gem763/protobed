The end of summer was hot and sticky in Georgia, but my car was where I lived.\n\nI wrote poetry between sobs in the school library and watched students line up in the caf\u00e9 to buy pizza and burgers. I had no money to buy food.\n\nI still remember that painful smell in the air of hot grease and French fries.\n\nNo one knew what I was going through. You couldn\u2019t tell I was homeless by looking at me. I made sure no one saw me take baths in the school sink or eat out of the caf\u00e9 trash cans. If anyone saw me, they didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nAre you homeless in college, like me?\n\nI went to college because, growing up, I loved school. It was my safe haven. I was excited to start college like my friends. When I first became homeless, at 18 years old, going to college kept me off the street.\n\nI was homeless until my junior year. It took me longer than normal to finish, but I received my associate\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s degrees in English. I have the certificates on my wall to prove it.\n\nAn expensive mistake: I completed my son's college applications just to learn he didn't want to go to college\n\nAs I drive through downtown Phoenix or near my home in Tempe, I see dozens of Arizona State University students walking to and from class.\n\nThe fall semester has started, and I wonder if the students I see are that student like me, normal on the outside but fighting for their life on the inside.\n\nA survey by The Hope Center for College, Community and Justice found that homelessness affected 18% of students attending two-year colleges and 14% of those attending four-year universities.\n\nIf you\u2019re out there, these three tips are for you. They helped me.\n\nTip 1: Make friends\n\nThe best friends I made in college were in my Japanese class. Hiroko, Saori, Don, Emily and Ester were my lifesavers.\n\nAfter class and on the weekends we\u2019d get together to study or just hang out. Hiroko and Ester would invite us to their homes and cook for us. Sometimes we\u2019d go out to sing karaoke; other nights we\u2019d go have Korean BBQ.\n\nIt was very rare when I had money to go out with them, but they paid my way so many times and asked no questions.\n\nThe rot in college admissions: I know college admissions offices from the inside \u2014 schools basically sign off on scandal\n\nI never told them I was living in my car, but if I didn\u2019t have them, I would not have finished college. They made college fun, and with them, I was able to escape from my situation for a few hours each afternoon.\n\nI felt like a normal college student.\n\nTip 2: Tell someone, get help\n\nI was too ashamed and prideful to seek help. I also didn\u2019t know where to go.\n\nI encourage you to do it. There are programs you can apply to for food and financial assistance.\n\nGo to your college adviser and the financial aid office; let them know what you are going through. You can still qualify for financial aid.\n\nI never spoke up, but I wish I had. That information was never given to me, but it exists.\n\nTip 3: Never give up\n\nIts clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s true. There were many times where I could have just left college and started a life on the street.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a support system pushing me to graduate, didn\u2019t have a dream job that required a college degree. I worked in the mall and was an intern at a newspaper.\n\nAs hard as the college experience was at times, from the algebra class I had to take twice, or when campus security officers said I couldn\u2019t sleep in the parking lot anymore, I couldn\u2019t give up.\n\nMy goal was to become the first person on my mom\u2019s side of the family to get their college degree.\n\nThrough everything that made me homeless, I still wanted to make my family proud.\n\nI wanted to make myself proud.\n\nIt was hard, but it wasn't impossible.\n\nElizabeth Montgomery is a producer for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com, where this column originally appeared.
