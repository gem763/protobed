(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nWhen a first-grader lost his tooth at school and couldn\u2019t locate it, his principal wrote a \u201cverification\u201d letter for the Tooth Fairy.\n\nLast week, Landon, a student at Gillett Elementary in Wisconsin was outside playing ball during recess when his loose tooth fell out. When he noticed it was missing, teachers and classmates searched in a pile of wood chips by the ball pit, to no avail. So, a teacher informed principal Curt Angeli about the problem and suggested they send a note to the Tooth Fairy.\n\nAngeli decided to go all out. \u201cI ran back to my office and thought, \u2018Let\u2019s make it cute\u2019 so I typed the note on school letterhead,\u201d Angeli tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nThe letter read, \u201cDear Tooth Fairy, today [Landon] lost a tooth while playing outside at recess. Unfortunately, it was lost in our ga-ga pit, and despite the valiant efforts of an intrepid search team, we were unable to recover the tooth. As a trained principal and hobby dentist, I can verify that there is definitely a gap in [Landon]\u2019s teeth that was not there this morning when he came in.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease accept this letter as official verification of a lost tooth and provide the standard monetary exchange rate you normally use for a real tooth,\u201d wrote the principal of six years, adding a funny post script: \u201cI am still waiting for the money for my wisdom teeth from 1987. Please remit as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nA Wisconsin principal vouched for a first-grader who misplaced his lost his tooth.
