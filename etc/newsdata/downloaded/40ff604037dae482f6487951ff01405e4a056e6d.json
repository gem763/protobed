Thanks for waking up with us and remember to sign up.\n\nA firefighter drags a hose closer to battle a grass fire on East Cypress Road in Knightsen, Calif. (Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group/San Jose Mercury News via AP)\n\nOutside the Beltway\n\nTRUMP VS. CALIFORNIA: In case you haven't noticed, California's on fire. And according to scientists and environmentalists, wildfires will only increase in frequency and severity \u2014 and not just there. Scenes of elite enclaves aflame in Los Angeles and Sonoma could be a window into what the rest of the country will face in the very near future due to climate change.\n\nYet as California burns, the Trump administration continues to target the state that has served as the nation's leader in implementing ambitious climate change policy. The push to aggressively roll back climate policies as part of the administration's broader deregulatory push, experts say, is worsening the impacts of natural disasters that are happening on the West Coast in real time.\n\nCalifornia objects to the Trump administration move to weaken Obama-era fuel efficiency standards \u2014 and revoke the state's authority to set its own rules under the Clean Air Act: \u201cThis is not just another legislative game here,\u201d former governor Jerry Brown (D) said Tuesday, speaking before the House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on Environment. \u201cThis is life-and-death stuff. And climate change is related to the fires in California. California is burning while the deniers make a joke out of the standards that could protect us all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not just another legislative game here,\u201d former governor Jerry Brown (D) said Tuesday, speaking before the House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on Environment. \u201cI think the entire agenda of the Trump administration on climate change is at odds with the reality in California,\u201d said Jody Freeman, the founding director of the Harvard Law School Environmental & Energy Law Program who served as an energy and climate change counselor in the Obama White House. \u201cThe federal government is behaving like it\u2019s in a different world than what the state of California is dealing with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWildfires are raging out of control and California is keenly aware of what they need to do to solve this problem,\u201d Freeman told Power Up, \u201cand then you see the systematic attempt by Trump to dismantle every tool to deal with climate change \u2026 There is an element of this that almost seems mean-spirited and intentionally punitive.\u201d\n\nIt's not just your imagination: Today's wildfires are hotter and deadlier than ever.\n\n\u201cFive of California\u2019s 20 deadliest wildfires have occurred during the last two years. And 10 of the 20 most destructive wildfires, in terms of structures lost, occurred over the last 10 years,\u201d per the Los Angeles Times's Editorial Board.\n\nThere's a reason for that: Experts explained to Power Up that while you can't draw a clear and direct line from climate change to a particular wildfire or natural disaster, the conditions created by climate change worsen natural disasters.\n\nFor example: Known as Santa Anas, the \u201cfierce, hot and dry winds\u201d currently fanning California's fires face an uncertain future \u201cin a changing climate,\u201d the New York Times's Henry Fountain reports. \u201cCoupled with changes in patterns of precipitation that are also expected to occur as the climate warms, it may mean that California\u2019s wildfire season will shift from fall into winter, with longer and more intense fires later in the year.\u201d\n\nKnown as Santa Anas, the \u201cfierce, hot and dry winds\u201d currently fanning California's fires face an uncertain future \u201cin a changing climate,\u201d the New York Times's Henry Fountain reports. \u201cCoupled with changes in patterns of precipitation that are also expected to occur as the climate warms, it may mean that California\u2019s wildfire season will shift from fall into winter, with longer and more intense fires later in the year.\u201d \u201c California is living with conditions that we expect to see more generally in lots of places,\u201d Freeman told Power Up. \u201cSo these fires should be a warning \u2014 and encouragement \u2014 to the federal government to take more action and not less.\u201d\n\nFreeman told Power Up. Many scientists agree: \u201cWe expect that absent aggressive regulation to control greenhouse gases emissions, these wildfire smokes are expected to increase in intensity and iteration,\u201d Francesca Dominici, the Co-Director of the Harvard Data Science Initiative and a professor of biostatistics, told Power Up.\n\nThat has not been the approach of the Trump administration, which has sought to undo climate policies \u2014 even at a state level \u2014 put in place during the Obama administration.\n\nKey context: \u201cEven with the Obama-era regulations in place, it would have been hard for the United States to cut its contributions to climate change enough to forestall dangerous warming,\u201d our colleague Dino Grandoni, author of The Energy 202 newsletter, told us. \u201cThe Trump administration's regulatory rollbacks \u2014 as well as the lack of pressure the president is applying to other nations to cut their emissions as well \u2014 makes hitting that goal all but impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven with the Obama-era regulations in place, it would have been hard for the United States to cut its contributions to climate change enough to forestall dangerous warming,\u201d our colleague Dino Grandoni, author of The Energy 202 newsletter, told us. \u201cThe Trump administration's regulatory rollbacks \u2014 as well as the lack of pressure the president is applying to other nations to cut their emissions as well \u2014 makes hitting that goal all but impossible.\u201d By the numbers: roughly 85 environmental rules are being rolled back under Trump, per the New York Times's Nadja Popvich, Livia Albeck-Ripka, and Kendra Pierre-Louis.\n\nWhen federal environmental statutes were first passed in the 1970s, Congress created a minimum set of protections that were designed for the states to be able to exceed. Trump is currently attempting to even reverse that history in the fight between the administration and California over the state's fuel efficiency standards.\n\nIt's exposed a rift in the auto industry: \u201cA coalition of international automakers, including General Motors, Toyota and Fiat Chrysler, on Monday announced an effort to intervene on behalf of the Trump administration in its ongoing fight with California over how fuel-efficient the nation\u2019s auto fleet must be in coming years,\u201d our colleagues Brady Dennis and Juliet Eilperin report.\n\n\u201cA coalition of international automakers, including General Motors, Toyota and Fiat Chrysler, on Monday announced an effort to intervene on behalf of the Trump administration in its ongoing fight with California over how fuel-efficient the nation\u2019s auto fleet must be in coming years,\u201d our colleagues Brady Dennis and Juliet Eilperin report. Power struggle: \u201cJohn Bozzella, president of the Association of Global Automakers and a spokesperson for the coalition, said Monday that the companies intervening are not necessarily endorsing a White House proposal that would essentially freeze fuel standards enacted during the Obama administration. But he said the firms do support the long-standing principle that the federal government has the 'sole purview' for setting national standards. Ultimately, he said, what the group wants is for California and the federal government to forge a compromise on one national set of fuel-economy standards \u2014 a compromise that so far has been nowhere in sight.\u201d\n\nCalifornia fired back: \u201cIt's really something at the very moment when California is burning, General Motors jumps on the bandwagon as Trump's lap dog to join the opposition to undercut California's rules,\u201d Brown said.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed in the Association of Global Automakers for hiding behind the Trump administration\u2019s skirts and its assault on public health,\u201d California\u2019s top air pollution regulator, Mary Nichols, told Brady and Juliet. \u201cCalifornia will continue to carry out our mandate to meet national air quality standards and keep working with those automakers committed to a framework that delivers cleaner vehicles that benefit consumers and the environment.\u201d\n\nAt the very moment when California is burning, @GM jumps on the bandwagon as @realDonaldTrump's lapdog. pic.twitter.com/SMQnVq63l5 \u2014 Jerry Brown (@JerryBrownGov) October 29, 2019\n\nAnd there's another policy battle playing out at the Environmental Protection Agency at the intersection of climate and public health policy that could ultimately hurt California: Over air pollution. A potential reason small-particle pollution is getting worse, per our colleague Christopher Ingraham, is the rollback of regulatory enforcement at the EPA. Clean Air Act enforcement actions fell in the first two years of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cLast year, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler disbanded the expert academic panel that reviewed and advised the agency on its standards for small-particle air pollution,\u201d reports The Post's Christopher Ingraham. \u201cIn its place, the administration has hired consultants with links to the fossil fuel, pharmaceutical and tobacco industries. The disbanded academic panel convened independently this year and is calling on the agency to impose stricter regulations to combat the pollutants.\u201d\n\nLowering those standards below existing standards would increase mortality rates, Dominici told Power Up, citing a new Carnegie Mellon study that estimates that 10,000 lives would have been saved in 2018 had pollution levels not increased since 2016.\n\nDominici told Power Up, citing a new Carnegie Mellon study that estimates that 10,000 lives would have been saved in 2018 had pollution levels not increased since 2016. In the aftermath of California's wildfires, it is especially important to aggressively police air pollution, she said: \u201cWildfire smoke is very problematic,\u201d per Dominici. \u201cWe have estimated that the levels of fine particulate matter during the wildfires are really high \u2026 but also the source from wildfires tends to be more toxic.\u201d\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter.

(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nThe Investigations\n\nGOP IN FLUX OVER UKRAINE CALL ACCOUNT: \u201cA top National Security Council official delivered a firsthand account of [Trump] pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, putting congressional Republicans in a bind and emboldening Democrats as they moved toward their first impeachment vote Thursday,\u201d our colleagues Rachael Bade, Karoun Demirjian, Mike DeBonis and Seung Min Kim report.\n\nTrump and his allies torched the NSC official: Trump attacked Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman as a \u201cNever Trumper,\u201d but some of his allies went even further in ugly and vicious attacks that called Vindman's patriotism into question.\n\nTrump attacked Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman as a \u201cNever Trumper,\u201d but some of his allies went even further in ugly and vicious attacks that called Vindman's patriotism into question. John Yoo, a former top lawyer in George W. Bush's White House, accused Vindman of committing \u201cespionage\u201d against the U.S. He was egged on by Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who noted that Vindman is a Ukrainian-American immigrant and that \u201cUkrainian officials had recently sought the colonel\u2019s advice about interacting with [Trump\u2019s] personal lawyer, [Rudy Giuliani],\" the New York Times's Michael M. Grynbaum and Davey Alba report. (Yoo later said he was trying to say Ukraine was the one committing espionage.)\n\nBarbs about Vindman's loyalty were too much for some lawmakers: Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the No. 3 House Republican and a fierce defender of the president, said such attacks were \"shameful\" and beneath the party. \"We\u2019re talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation, who have put their lives on the line. And it is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation, and we should not be involved in that process. . . . We don\u2019t do that as Republicans.\u201d\n\nVindman is a distinguished Vietnam vet: Task & Purpose's Haley Britzky's obtained his full record, which includes a Purple Heart.\n\nTask & Purpose's Haley Britzky's obtained his full record, which includes a Purple Heart. He and his twin brother, who also works in the White House, were also briefly featured in Ken Burn's \"America\" series, as our colleague\n\nPhilip Bump uncovered.\n\nThat was not the only drama surrounding Vindman's testimony: The closed-door deposition erupted into chaos as Democratic lawmakers accused Republicans of trying to unmask the whistleblower during their questioning, CNN's Manu Raju, Jeremy Herb, Lauren Fox and Phil Mattingly report. GOP lawmakers defended the questioning as a fair way to inquire about who Vindman had spoken with.\n\nThe fight comes just a day after the Daily Beast's Spencer Ackerman, Sam Brodey, Adam Rawnsley reported that an aide to the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, is leaking the whistleblower's name to GOP lawmakers in an attempt to get the person's identity into official transcripts that are expected to eventually be made public.\n\nAttorneys for the whistleblower are reportedly receiving death threats: \"While the identity of the person remains publicly unknown, the legal team representing him has received multiple death threats that have led to at least one law-enforcement investigation, according to people close to the legal team, as well as other abusive communications,\" the Wall Street Journal's Dustin Volz, Andrew Restuccia and Siobhan Hughes report. \"None of the threats thus far have appeared to be actual credible threats of violence, the people said.\"\n\nAnd here's how two White House meetings tell the story of the Ukraine investigation: Our colleague Greg Miller dives into how two July 10 meetings that multiple witnesses have recounted to lawmakers are central to the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe text of a House resolution released by the Democrats that authorizes the next phase of the impeachment inquiry (AP Photo/Jon Elswick)\n\nOn The Hill\n\nMEANWHILE: Democrats unveiled legislation authorizing the next phase of the impeachment inquiry against Trump: \u201cAn eight-page resolution calls for open hearings and requires the House Intelligence Committee to submit a report outlining its findings and recommendations, with a final recommendation on impeachment left to the Judiciary Committee,\u201d the Associated Press' Matthew Daly reports. The entire House is expected to vote on the measure on Thursday.\n\nKey highlights: \u201c Trump and his lawyers would be able to cross-examine witnesses once the Judiciary Committee takes over the inquiry, they would also be to request additional witnesses,\u201d the Times' Nicholas Fandos and Charlie Savage report. Republicans on the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees would also have the right to request a subpoena, but would need the sign-off of the Democratic chair or the support of a majority of the committee.\n\nTrump and his lawyers would be able to cross-examine witnesses once the Judiciary Committee takes over the inquiry, they would also be to request additional witnesses,\u201d the Times' Nicholas Fandos and Charlie Savage report. Republicans on the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees would also have the right to request a subpoena, but would need the sign-off of the Democratic chair or the support of a majority of the committee. One Democrat is already saying he will vote no on the resolution: \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen in my mind, it\u2019s going to happen here in the House; it will go over to the Senate, and then he will believe that he has been exonerated,\u201d Rep. Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.) told our colleagues. \u201cHe will still be the president, and he will still be the candidate \u2014 a candidate who has been exonerated by the Senate.\u201d But other Democrats, including those in Trump-won districts, said they would back the measure.\n\nAnd there's another important hearing happening today at 10 a.m.: \u201cSenate Democrats plan to use the confirmation hearing of John Sullivan, nominated to be the next U.S. ambassador to Russia, to press the State Department official on the administration\u2019s approach toward Ukraine, which is the focus of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry,\u201d my colleague Seung Min Kim and I report.\n\n\u201cSullivan, who currently serves as the deputy secretary of state, was the official who told Marie Yovanovitch, then the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, that she was being recalled from her post in Kyiv in May, according to Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony before House impeachment investigators earlier this month.\u201d\n\nKey: \u201cThe expectation is for the deputy secretary to be questioned about a wide range of topics including his role into the Trump administration\u2019s politically motivated retaliation against career department employees, his involvement in the unfolding Trump-Ukraine scandal and the president\u2019s utterly disturbing approach to U.S.-Russia relations,\u201d one of the aides told us.\n\nAND GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS IS BACK: A former top Trump campaign adviser once called him a \u201ccoffee boy\u201d and the president said he didn't make a lasting impression,\u201d but Papadopoulos now wants to be a congressman. Papadopoulos, the man whose comments may have launched the Russia probe, has filed to run for the seat currently held by Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) who is resigning from Congress after questions were raised about whether she had an improper relationship with a staffer.\n\nNCAA President Mark Emmert. (David J.

But the potentially historic move still leaves a number of questions unanswered.\n\nMore details: \"Conceptually, [the] announcement indicates that the NCAA is walking away from its longtime ban on players enjoying the fruits of their names, images and likenesses,\" Sports Illustrated's Michael McCann reports. \"When played out to its logical conclusion, the NCAA\u2019s new position will enable college athletes to sign endorsement deals, negotiate to have avatars of their identities published in video games (so, yes, a return to college sports video games), contract to sponsor camps, be paid to sign autographs, and get a check to have their last names appear on replica jerseys.\"\n\n\"Conceptually, [the] announcement indicates that the NCAA is walking away from its longtime ban on players enjoying the fruits of their names, images and likenesses,\" Sports Illustrated's Michael McCann reports. \"When played out to its logical conclusion, the NCAA\u2019s new position will enable college athletes to sign endorsement deals, negotiate to have avatars of their identities published in video games (so, yes, a return to college sports video games), contract to sponsor camps, be paid to sign autographs, and get a check to have their last names appear on replica jerseys.\" Just to be super clear here: Schools would not pay athletes themselves. Instead college athletes would be able to sign deals on their own similar to how Olympic athletes approach their deals.
