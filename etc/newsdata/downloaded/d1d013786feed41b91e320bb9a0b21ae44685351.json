But the judge is letting those in. He\u2019s letting them talk all about their, you know the terrible public relations they took. But at the same time, we\u2019ve not been able, thus far, to show any of the videos that caused this great public reaction. And Planned Parenthood is trying to get damages, after the publication of the videos that they say weren\u2019t caused by the public reactions.\n\nDaleiden himself tweeted the judge\u2019s decision to prevent the jury from seeing the videos is a violation of \u201cdue process\u201d:\n\nBREAKING: major due process violations in trial vs @PPFA as PP convinces Judge Orrick to BAN us from showing the jury the exact video conversations that PP is suing for! How can @CtrMedProgress witness on stand rebut false PP claims re: \u201cprivacy\u201d without playing the convos?! #1A \u2014 David Daleiden (@daviddaleiden) October 8, 2019\n\nBreen said the problem for his team is they need to show public reaction to the videos, which depicted top-level Planned Parenthood officials haggling over the price of body parts of aborted babies, was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s good reason for it, because the videos, showed evidence of terrible crimes and the willingness to commit those crimes by top officials at Planned Parenthood,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting as hard as we can, but based on the recent rulings, we\u2019re having a fight with one hand tied behind our back, possibly both.\u201d\n\nAs the Federalist reported, in opening statements, Judge William Orrick of U.S. District Court in San Francisco instructed the jury the case \u201cis not about the truth of whether plaintiffs profited from the sale of fetal tissue or otherwise violated the law in securing tissue for those programs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose issues are a matter of dispute between the parties in the world outside this courtroom,\u201d the judge added.\n\nBreen told Breitbart News:\n\nImagine what it is going to be like for these jurors to sit through six weeks of Planned Parenthood talking about all the terrible things that happened to them, none of which should be relevant to damages. And yet, we\u2019re going to be unable to talk about why those things were actually happening, in defense.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s starting to look like we\u2019re engaged in a game of heads Planned Parenthood wins, tails we lose \u2013 on the presentation of evidence,\u201d Breen added.\n\nDaleiden reported as well on Center for Medical Progress\u2019s (CMP) website:\n\nAt Planned Parenthood\u2019s request, Judge Orrick refused to allow the Defense to show the jury the exact video conversations that Planned Parenthood is suing for. It is the jury\u2019s job to assess whether the conversations are \u201cprivate\u201d or \u201cconfidential\u201d under applicable state law\u2013yet Planned Parenthood and Judge Orrick are barring the actual recordings of these conversations from the courtroom. Adrian Lopez, one of CMP\u2019s undercover investigators, took the witness stand and was accused by Planned Parenthood of videotaping so-called \u201cprivate\u201d conversations at a National Abortion Federation trade show in Baltimore, MD, yet defense attorney Paul Jonna was not allowed to play video of the conversation itself, a graphic discussion with Plaintiff Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast leadership, to allow Lopez and CMP to defend against Planned Parenthood\u2019s accusation. Ironically, Planned Parenthood was allowed to play multiple recordings of undercover conversations during their questioning.\n\nPlanned Parenthood initially sought over $20 million in damages, but those damages have since been reduced to several hundred thousands of dollars, in addition to legal and attorney fees, which could yet run into millions of dollars.\n\nIn a separate criminal case against Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, the CMP colleagues are the first undercover journalists to be criminally prosecuted in the history of the state of California.\n\nDaleiden and Merritt were slapped with 15 felony counts of recording confidential information without consent by the office of the California Attorney General (AG), including its past AG, current U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, and her successor, Xavier Becerra.\n\nHarris received thousands of dollars in campaign donations from Planned Parenthood, and, subsequently, she and her office raided Daleiden\u2019s home and seized his personal property, including his laptop, instead of prosecuting Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe preliminary hearing at San Francisco\u2019s Superior Court concluded in September.", "description": "Attorney Peter Breen said the judge hearing the civil case against Daleiden blocked the jury from seeing the Planned Parenthood videos.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/clinicians-planned-parenthood-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
