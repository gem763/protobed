UPDATE 2-Oil prices surge 15% after attack on Saudi facilities hits global supply\n\n(Adds comments, background)\n\nBy Devika Krishna Kumar\n\nNEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Oil prices surged more than\n\n15% to their highest level in nearly four months at the open on\n\nSunday after an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities on\n\nSaturday that knocked out more than 5% of global oil supply.\n\nBrent crude futures jumped more than 19% to a session high\n\nof $71.95 a barrel at the opening, while U.S. crude futures\n\nsurged more than 15% to a session high of $63.34 a barrel. Both\n\nbenchmarks rose to the highest since May.\n\nPrices were up about 12% by 6:50 p.m. (2250 GMT), as gains\n\nwere capped after U.S. President Donald Trump said he authorized\n\nthe release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n\n(SPR) if needed in a quantity to be determined because of the\n\nattack on Saudi's facilities. State oil giant Saudi Aramco said the attack cut output by\n\n5.7 million barrels per day, at a time when Aramco is trying to\n\nready itself for what is expected to be the world's largest\n\nshare sale. Aramco gave no timeline for output resumption. A source\n\nclose to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity\n\ncould take \"weeks, not days.\" Saudi Arabia's oil exports will continue as normal this week\n\nas the kingdom taps into stocks from its large storage\n\nfacilities, an industry source briefed on the developments told\n\nReuters on Sunday. \"The surge in prices is the natural knee jerk reaction but\n\nthe path ahead and ability to sustain at elevated levels remains\n\ndependent on the duration of the outage, the ability to meet\n\nexport commitments through domestic drawdowns, demand elasticity\n\nat higher prices as well as government and agency policy,\" said\n\nMichael Tran, managing director of energy strategy at RBC\n\nCapital Markets in New York.\n\n\"Even if the outage normalizes quickly, the threat of\n\nsidelining nearly 6% of global oil production is no longer a\n\nhypothetical, a black swan or a fat tail. Welcome back, risk\n\npremium.\"\n\nThe attack on plants in the heartland of Saudi Arabia's oil\n\nindustry, including the world's biggest petroleum-processing\n\nfacility, came from the direction of Iran, and cruise missiles\n\nmay have been used, according to a senior U.S. official.\n\n\"Saudi authorities have claimed to control the fires, but\n\nthis falls far short of extinguishing them,\" said Abhishek\n\nKumar, head of analytics at Interfax Energy in London.\n\n\"The damage to facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais appears to\n\nbe extensive, and it may be weeks before oil supplies are\n\nnormalised,\" Kumar said.\n\nSaudi Arabia is set to become a significant buyer of refined\n\nproducts after attacks on Saturday, consultancy Energy Aspects\n\nsaid in a note. State oil firm Saudi Aramco will likely buy significant\n\nquantities of gasoline, diesel and possibly fuel oil while\n\ncutting liquefied petroleum gas exports.\n\nU.S. gasoline futures jumped 11%, while U.S. heating\n\noil futures rose about 6.5% at the open.\n\n\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 2-Oil prices surge 15% after attack on Saudi facilities hits global supply", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEBB70BB_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
