(AP) - As Collage Dance Collective celebrates its 10th anniversary season this fall, executive director Marcellus Harper is amazed by the ballet company\u2019s success, and hopes to accomplish more in the coming years.\n\n\u201cIt reminds us how young the organization is, too,\u201d Harper said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that we still want to do and see necessary to do, and we\u2019re excited about this next chapter.\u201d\n\nCollage, located in the Broad Avenue Arts District in Binghampton, is launching its 10th anniversary season with its fall program ballet performance from Oct. 25-27 at Germantown Performing Arts Center.\n\nCollage was founded in New York in 2006, and relocated to Memphis in 2007 as the company\u2019s leadership was attracted to the city\u2019s growing arts movement.\n\nThe company started with one student at a Memphis church, and used several church spaces over its first few years in Memphis. Collage launched its first professional ballet season in 2009 and settled into its current home at 2497 Broad Ave. in 2012.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played an integral part in the revitalization that\u2019s happened on Broad Avenue,\u201d Harper said. \u201cLots of folks in the district were really working to center arts and creative makers and using that energy to spur economic development. That\u2019s always resonated with us.\u201d\n\nCollage now serves nearly 500 students a week and has eight professional dancers who tour nationally and internationally. Students, from ages 2 to high school, and dancers perform both classical and contemporary ballet.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we could\u2019ve predicted it,\u201d Harper said about the company\u2019s success. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had the vision, but it\u2019s hard sometimes, particularly when you have a vision that seems too massive to predict how you\u2019re going to get there.\u201d\n\nRickey Flagg II is entering his fifth year with Collage\u2019s professional performance group. Originally from Connecticut, Flagg said Collage\u2019s family-like atmosphere has helped him in his craft, as opposed to prior companies he performed for where there was a more \u201cmalicious\u201d atmosphere.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time I was able to open my eyes to being something bigger to myself,\u201d Flagg said of Collage.\n\nCollage needs to continue inspiring students, he said, particularly those of color, and exposing others who are not as familiar with their work to the arts. Flagg also pointed to the company\u2019s diversity as another reason for its growing success.\n\n\u201cWe have people from different parts of the world,\u201d Flagg said. \u201cEspecially in the South, it\u2019s not a frequent practice I\u2019ll say.\u201d\n\nLuisa Cardoso auditioned for Collage several years ago in Miami when she was wrapping up her time at Miami City Ballet School. Several successful auditions later, Cardoso, who is from Brazil, is now entering her fourth season with Collage.\n\nCardoso said it took a while to adjust to the slower pace of Memphis compared to Miami and her hometown of Salvador, Brazil, which has a population of nearly 3 million people. Collage\u2019s engagement with its students and the community at large really impressed her.\n\n\u201cI hope that people want to come to Memphis and make Memphis (their) home,\u201d Cardoso said.\n\nGrowing the number of national and international students and tripling the number of students served are two of Harper\u2019s goals for the next three to five years. Collage also hopes to build new offices and performance space at 501 Tillman St. to accommodate its growth.\n\n\u201cWe have to continue the work so we can make this even larger,\u201d Harper said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Daily Memphian, http://https://www.dailymemphian.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As Collage Dance Collective celebrates its 10th anniversary season this fall, executive director Marcellus Harper is amazed by the ballet company's success, and hopes to accomplish more in the coming years.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Omer Yusuf", "The Daily Memphian"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/exchange-dance_troupe_93161_c0-1132-3300-3057_s1200x700.jpg?07d25825606519704798fc828d6aec7e4f1b9b15", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
