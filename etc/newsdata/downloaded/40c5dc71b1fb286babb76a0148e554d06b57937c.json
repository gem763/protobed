Immediately, she canceled her credit cards, went through a TSA check to get on her plane, and was issued a new driver's license.\n\nOn Wednesday, however, she received a package in the mail.\n\n\u201cI received this envelope addressed to me,\u201d Scott told Fox2Now. \u201cI opened it up. It was my wallet with a cute little letter from Jen in Arizona.\u201d\n\nJen McAnally, from Peoria, Ariz., was in Vegas for a bachelorette party when she spotted Scott's wallet on the floor of a cab. After the driver told her he had no way to contact Scott, McAnally made it her mission to get the wallet back to its rightful owner.\n\nMcAnally first attempted to find Scott on social media to let her know her wallet had been found and was in good hands, but had no luck in locating her.\n\n\u201cI just felt like hanging onto it. It was better than leaving it, you know? Didn\u2019t want someone to get a hold of it and anything bad to happen,\u201d McAnally told the news outlet.\n\nAlong with the wallet, McAnally sent a letter to Scott.\n\n\"I found your wallet on Friday night in a cab in Vegas,\" the letter read in part. \"The driver said he had no way to track you. I didn\u2019t want to leave it for some scumbag to find it. Hopefully losing this didn\u2019t ruin your weekend. Sorry we couldn\u2019t get it to you sooner.\"\n\nScott was able to track down Mcanally on Facebook to thank her, and now others on the social media site are praising her good deed.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s basic human decency,\" McAnally told Fox2Now. \"Weird to be getting praised for that ,but happy I was able to make her day.\u201d\n\nScott and McAnally did not immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A woman, who lost her wallet in Las Vegas, said there is \"proof good humans exist\" after her wallet was mailed to her by a good Samaritan.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/q5GWAhpO8Fnu9NINVthSxw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/ktvi_st_louis_449/ac862006006e3bd7e5d3abf7ac545c21", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
