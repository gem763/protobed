Through the work we do, we will identify more lines, it will be greater awareness and greater understanding of what the problem is. That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t growth, because it\u2019s a very fluid, dynamic model. Drugs gangs go to where the markets are.\u201d\n\nNikki Holland, the NCA\u2019s director of investigations and county lines lead, said an intelligence gathering exercise in 2015 found seven forces were reporting county lines behaviour. By 2017, this had rapidly expanded to 38 forces and by 2018 44 forces including the BTP had county lines activity on their patch.\n\nQuick guide What is \u2018county lines\u2019 and who are the victims? Show Hide What does the term \u2018county lines\u2019 mean? The name \u2018county lines\u2019 refers to the phone numbers, or lines, that criminal gangs which traffic drugs from urban to rural areas use to organise the sale of their wares. Gangs in cities such as London, Birmingham and Liverpool use children to deal mostly heroin and crack cocaine over a network of dedicated mobile phones to smaller towns and rural areas. How big is the problem? The number of individual phone numbers identified by law enforcement officials as being used on established county lines networks is about 2,000 \u2013 nearly three times the 720 previously established. Police estimate the phone numbers are linked to about 1,000 branded networks, with a single line capable of making \u00a3800,000 profits in a year. Who are the victims and how are they recruited? The majority of victims groomed into working for gangs are 15- to 17-year-old boys but children as young as 11 have been safeguarded and girls have been targeted.\n\nMany victims are recruited over social media, with offenders luring them with images of cash, designer clothing and luxury cars, but vulnerable girls and women are being targeted by men who create the impression of a romantic relationship before subjecting them to sexual exploitation. How big is the problem? In 2015, about seven forces reported county lines behaviour. Now, 44 forces, including British Transport Police, have recorded county lines behaviour on their turf. No one really knows how many young people across the country are being forced to take part. Children without criminal records \u2013 known as \u2018clean skins\u2019 \u2013 are preferred because they are less likely to be known to detectives. The Children\u2019s Society says 4,000 teenagers in London alone are exploited through county lines, while the children\u2019s commissioner estimated at least 46,000 children in England were caught up in gangs.\n\n\u201cThe picture around county lines is the best it\u2019s ever been in terms of what we know,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the best position we\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nDCS Paul Furnell is head of crime and public protection at the BTP, which plays a major role in tackling county lines as the rail network is key to the transport of drugs, particularly by vulnerable minors too young to drive.\n\nHe said the rise in reports of vulnerability was \u201cgood news \u2026 because it\u2019s uncovering what we know to be a very under-reported areas of crime. And I think that that\u2019s still the case. And I think we\u2019re seeing increases because we\u2019re being more professionally curious as an organisation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking beyond the obvious so I would expect in two years, the figures around county lines, the figures around missing and exploited to be higher than they are now, and we would need to recognise that\u2019s partly because of good work that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nHolland, Ball and Furnell are spearheading the law enforcement fight against county lines, which is bolstered by the \u00a33.6m National County Lines Coordination Centre, which became fully operational a year ago.\n\nLondon, the West Midlands and Merseyside continue to be the main exporters of county lines, and the south-east, south, east and the north-west are worst hit as \u201cimporters\u201d, according to the latest intelligence picture.\n\nCrack cocaine and heroin are the principal drugs pushed by county lines, with crack prices remaining low, at about \u00a310 a rock, and purity is high.\n\nQuarterly increases in the number of children being linked to county lines are attributed to improved identification based on stronger intelligence.\n\nThe exploitation of children to transport and sell drugs continues. Referrals to the national referral mechanism \u2013 the official framework for identifying and referring potential victims of modern slavery \u2013 for county lines exploitation have continued to increase, with the vast majority juveniles.\n\nBall is clear about the central role vulnerability plays in the phenomenon. \u201cThe model is driven by violence, exploitation and vulnerability,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout vulnerability, the model would not survive. It preys on the weak. The whole thing preys on the weak for financial gain for gang members and organised crime groups.\u201d\n\nBut vulnerability presents unique challenges to police forces. \u201cAt one end of the spectrum, you have a gang member who is absolutely in the category in which we would look to enforce and bring an end to the criminality,\u201d Ball said.\n\n\u201cAt the other end, you have a 10-year-old kid who has been bullied into it, faced violence, had drugs forced on him. As you get closer to the middle, that\u2019s when it gets harder. We have to make fairly early assessments as to whether we see someone as a suspect or a victim.\u201d\n\nHolland added: \u201cThe other tricky thing is people don\u2019t see themselves as victims. The lifestyle they may have been plucked out of is no bed, no food and a cold house. So being put into a gang is a more warm, more loving environment.\u201d\n\nBut the rewards rarely compensate for the difficulty young people find themselves in once caught up in the county lines trade, Holland said. \u201cSome of the conditions they are in, it defies belief that it would be out of the choice. Something is taken off them, they\u2019re indebted, you either do it or we\u2019ll hurt you and your family. They\u2019re in deep.\u201d\n\nPolice forces hope the increased use of modern slavery as a framework to deal with the offences will have an impact on the perception of county lines as a glamorous lifestyle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just saying: \u2018You\u2019re dealing drugs,\u2019 as people are quite happy to plead guilty to dealing drugs. What they\u2019re not happy to plead guilty to is the fact they are trafficking children. Within that there is a stigma. By using this legislation, we hope gangs will self-police themselves into not using children.\u201d", "description": "Officers using modern slavery legislation to crack down on underreported phenomenon", "authors": ["Jamie Grierson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dabc8982e6b43a85fb159933663887fd7632c029/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1f9f54791ba0cb45adf34c46e9a717d8", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
