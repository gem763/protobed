And the crowds at both were more positive on gold than I\u2019ve seen for almost a decade.\n\nAttendance at the MIF was off the hook. The organizers ordered 700 lanyards (name badge holders) and ran out. And presenting companies saw buying directly after the event, including one that saw more than 1 million shares of trading on Monday that they attributed directly to their participation at the MIF.\n\nWith a record crowd came new faces, which is just as important as positive interest from regular mining investors. Of course, we want gold-oriented folks to be paying attention and buying stocks, but for this market to really gain momentum, we need outside attention.\n\nAnd it\u2019s starting to show up. At the MIF I chatted with half a dozen attendees who were new to the mining space but had come to the conference because they saw, broadly speaking, opportunity in gold and they had money from successful marijuana investing burning a hole in their pockets.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how often in the last three or four years I\u2019ve heard the comment: \u201cIf only some of those weed investors would rotate into mining, our lack-of-investment-capital problem would be gone!\u201d And here they were, asking about how to invest in gold.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to find new investment ideas at the Metals Investor Forum because I am kept so busy during the event that I don\u2019t have time to learn about the companies I don\u2019t know. Thankfully, Beaver Creek provides precisely that opportunity.\n\nBeaver Creek is speed dating for the mining space. Public companies, from explorers to single asset operators, are matched up with money in the form of fund managers, analysts, letter writers and bankers, for half-hour meetings. The meeting schedule starts at 8 a.m. and runs to 6 p.m., with no breaks for coffee or lunch for the most requested companies or money sources.\n\nIt\u2019s intense, but super useful. I went through the list of participating companies weeks before the event and requested meetings with all those I did not know well but saw some reason to be interested in, whether because of a quick peruse of their website or because others had mentioned the stock to me.\n\nOne of the challenges of this stage of a gold bull market is covering all your bases. You want to have producers, mid-tier to major, for low risk leverage. You want a royalty company or two as well, for the same. You want single asset developers and operators, as the good ones will grow in value with the market and offer strong takeout potential. And you want exciting explorers.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. You want not exposure not only to gold but also to silver, and perhaps platinum and palladium. You need to actively broaden your scope from only seeking the best of the best \u2013 in terms of jurisdiction, project and people \u2013 to considering a wider swath of options, as more than the very best will do well as this market heats up. And you need to be open to more business models: I tend to avoid quick-to-production stories, for example, but they do well in a rising market.\n\nAll of that combines to mean that I could have met with almost every company in Beaver Creek. But that just brings us to the other challenge: making decisions. I had 35 meetings over 2.5 days in Beaver Creek. Almost every company was interesting to some degree. The real work, then, comes after the conference, in sorting through everything I learned and making investment decisions.\n\nAnd if you can believe it, getting to all the meetings and then analyzing all the information is only half of the goal at Beaver Creek.\n\nThe other half is finding out what else people are working on. It\u2019s finding out who\u2019s putting together a nice new deal, or taking a private vehicle public, or looking for a pubco home for a nice project they\u2019ve been holding onto for ages. These conversations aren\u2019t part of the official schedule; they happen over coffee or beer or dinner.\n\nAnd so the day isn\u2019t done until you\u2019ve attended a few receptions and a dinner, and worked the crowd in search of exciting new deals and financings. Getting in early is one of the best ways to limit risk, as it simply means a lower cost base. A new explorer with a single good asset likely comes out the gate with a market cap less than $4 million. Participating in that IPO financing can put you in a nice position as the group starts exploring and the market learns about the asset, a process that often boosts market valuations to two or three times that level (assuming it is a good deal, of course).\n\nGetting in early on great deals can mean earning fivefold or more, rather than the double you might get by buying once things are already in motion.\n\nI found several interesting deals on the sidelines at Beaver Creek. One is included in today\u2019s letter: Scottie Resources (TSXV: SCOT). It\u2019s not a total sleeper but it\u2019s raising money now to start really testing its land package, so it is still early.\n\nTwo others are still incubating, so I will convey those tales when the time is right.\n\nIn the meantime, expect several stock write-ups over the next while as I decide which of my 35 interesting meetings will turn into an investment.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Gwen Preston covering: .
