He\u2019s made it clear,\u201d Beal\u2019s agent Mark Bartelstein said Thursday morning. \u201cHe knows a lot of people are talking about sort of the downturn that the Washington Wizards may go through as they restructure and regroup here but he wants to kind of choose his own path and not necessarily jump on someone else\u2019s bandwagon but to be the reason Washington becomes a destination.\u201d\n\nBeal, 26, has emerged as the team\u2019s leader the past two years while five-time all-star point guard John Wall has battled injuries. In 2018-19, Beal became the first player in franchise history to average at least 25 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists. He became a hot topic for trade rumors as it became apparent that Wall may need the entire 2019-20 season to rehabilitate from an Achilles\u2019 injury while the Wizards revamped their roster by going younger.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe team offered the deal in July 26 but Beal has consistently said he would take a wait-and-see approach before signing on. The signing was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\n\u201cWashington is where I\u2019ve been the last seven years, going on eight. It would be great to play in one place forever,\u201d Beal told The Washington Post in June, before he officially received the offer. \u201cBut at the same time, you want to win and make sure you\u2019re in a position to do so.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, however, Beal\u2019s actions and words indicated more of a willingness to stay. Even dating back to last season.\n\nAhead of the 2019 All-Star Game in Charlotte, the NBA news cycle was dominated by Anthony Davis\u2019s trade request to leave the New Orleans Pelicans. In February, with Davis\u2019s demand as context and Wall\u2019s Achilles\u2019 injury still fresh, Beal spoke at length about his future. At that time, he admitted to wondering if the team might trade him or if the Wizards planned to \u201cstart all over.\u201d Beal struggled with the notion of not being in Washington.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLoyalty still speaks volumes. I think it still exists in our league,\u201d Beal said in February. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m just going to give all here until I can\u2019t no more. Until they don\u2019t want me anymore.\u201d\n\nMonths passed and Beal remained consistent in his mind set. When new General Manager Tommy Sheppard took control, he stayed in contact with Beal and his representative. Sheppard expressed how the team needed to show Beal its direction through restructuring over the summer, as well as once Beal returned for his eighth training camp with the Wizards.\n\n\u201cMost players like to know who they\u2019re playing with and I think he was very excited about some of the young talent that we brought in and moving forward where\u2019s that going to be,\u201d said Sheppard on July 22. \u201cI think Bradley\u2019s very excited about the vision of that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhenever Sheppard fielded questions about Beal, he did not appear anxious over the decision. Instead, Sheppard routinely said he did not expect a quick response. Sheppard and the Wizards felt emboldened to wait as Beal acted like a player who wanted to be in Washington.\n\nBeal attended the team\u2019s minicamp in Los Angeles, then returned early to the District for voluntary workouts after Labor Day. During this preseason, Beal, whose body language reveals his frustration and anger at times, appeared to be enjoying himself. He danced and celebrated with the Washington Mystics after the team won the WNBA championship on Oct. 10. The following night, as Beal poured in 21 points in 17 minutes against the New York Knicks, he held his right arm high after making finger roll layups and laughed with teammates on the sideline as the Wizards took control in the second half.\n\nFor the 2019-20 season, Beal will be the cornerstone of the Wizards and that position enticed him to stay, according to Bartelstein.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat was his ultimate dream was to stay here and be a part of this,\u201d said Bartelstein, who had conversations all summer with Sheppard and Ted Leonsis, the team\u2019s managing partner. \u201cAs we got deeper and deeper into it, it became really clear that they were going to do some terrific things and they were going to center all of it around Brad. That\u2019s what Brad wanted to hear.\"\n\nRead more on the Wizards:\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cThis is where he wants to be.
