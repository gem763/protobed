Sondland will testify before Congress next week\n\nSondland is expected to tell lawmakers that President Trump (seen above in Washington on Saturday) told him there was no quid pro quo with Ukraine. Trump is believed to have used military aid to Ukraine as leverage to force it to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden\n\nSondland also reportedly claims that he had no idea Trump's demand that Ukraine investigate corruption was aimed at getting incriminating information about Joe and Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company when his father was vice president\n\nOn September 9, Taylor told Sondland via text message that it was 'crazy' for the Trump administration to link assistance to Ukraine with help for a political campaign.\n\nTrump, through his attorney Rudy Giuliani, had been pressuring Ukraine to revisit an investigation into a Ukrainian gas company where Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, sat on the board of directors when his father was vice president.\n\nThe president held up some $400million in military assistance to Ukraine.\n\nTrump administration officials in the State Department, including Taylor, thought that the president was using the aid as leverage to get Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.\n\nSondland texted Taylor back hours later, saying that the president was 'crystal clear' that there had been no quid pro quo.\n\nHe sent the text after getting off the phone with Trump, who told him during a brief conversation that he did not 'want a quid pro quo \u2026 didn\u2019t want anything from Ukraine.'\n\nDemocrats say that the president abused the power of his office by using military aid to Ukraine as leverage to get its government to investigate Biden.\n\nBut Trump allies say that Sondland's text message to Taylor vindicates the president.\n\n'The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,' Sondland told Taylor via text on September 9.\n\nHe added: 'I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.'\n\nIn his testimony, Sondland will likely leave open the possibility that Trump wasn't being truthful in his denial.\n\nSondland will also raise the possibility that Trump abandoned plans to get Ukraine to investigate Biden in response to mounting criticism of his decision to withhold military assistance.\n\nIn his anticipated remarks to Congress, Sondland will say that for months he was taking instructions from Giuliani, who was working at the behest of his boss, Trump, to get Ukraine to investigate corruption.\n\nThe president wanted Ukraine to give a public statement that it intended to investigate Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that paid Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, to be on its board when his father was vice president.\n\nIn exchange for the statement, Trump would agree to a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nSondland was told by Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to get Ukraine to make a statement that it would investigate the Ukrainian gas firm linked to Hunter Biden, Burisma, in exchange for a White House meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (left)\n\n'It was a quid pro quo, but not a corrupt one,' a person familiar with Sondland\u2019s testimony told the Post.\n\nSondland is also expected to tell lawmakers that he only knew of the Hunter Biden-Burisma relationship after a whistleblower complained about Trump's phone call with the president of Ukraine last month.\n\nBut this is implausible given that Giuliani had been making television appearances for months alleging that the Bidens were guilty of corruption-related offenses in Ukraine.\n\nSondland's lawyer said on Friday that his client will testify to Congress next week as part of the impeachment investigation of Trump, despite a State Department order not to.\n\nSondland, a hotel executive who donated to Trump's 2016 campaign, was scheduled to testify this week but the administration blocked him.\n\nThat prompted a subpoena by committees leading the probe in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives for Sondland to be deposed in closed session.\n\n'Notwithstanding the State Department's current direction to not testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees' subpoena, and he looks forward to testifying on Thursday,' Sondland's lawyers Robert Luskin and Kwame Manley said Friday morning.\n\nThe statement was released Friday, shortly before the former U.S. ambassador in Kiev, Marie Yovanovitch, testified about what she knew of the Trump administration's pressure effort on Ukraine.\n\nTrump recalled Marie Yovanovitch (center), the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who testified to lawmakers behind closed doors on Friday\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, arrived Friday for an expected hearing with Yovanovitch\n\nSondland's lawyer had earlier said he wanted to testify, and that he had flown in from Brussels to appear on Capitol Hill \u2013 only to find himself blocked by Trump's State Department.\n\n'Ambassador Sondland has at all times acted with integrity and in the interests of the United States. He has no agenda apart from answering the Committees' questions fully and truthfully,' his lawyers said.\n\nSondland's deposition would give lawmakers the chance to probe his interactions with resigned U.S. Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker about an administration push to have Ukraine investigate Giuliani's unproven theory of Ukrainian election interference in 2016, as well as to investigate the Bidens.\n\nYovanovitch, the career diplomat was abruptly recalled from Ukraine in May, testified before Congress in defiance of Trump's ban.\n\nShe told House impeachment investigators Friday that Trump himself pressured the State Department to oust her from her post and get her out of the country.\n\nYovanovitch told lawmakers investigating Trump's dealings with Ukraine that there was a 'concerted campaign' against her based on 'unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.'\n\nThe diplomat was recalled from Kiev as Rudy Giuliani - who is Trump's personal attorney and has no official role in the U.S. government - pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate baseless corruption allegations against the Bidens.\n\nYovanovitch testified behind closed doors Friday for more than nine hours as part of the House Democrats' impeachment investigation. Her prepared remarks were obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nShe left without answering questions.\n\nThe testimony from Yovanovitch is the first of several depositions of key figures planned by the House committees spearheading the probe, and whether she makes her appearance will offer an early gauge of White House cooperation.\n\nYovanovitch, described by colleagues as a consummate professional, became the target in March of allegations \u2013 vehemently denied by the State Department \u2013 that she gave a Ukrainian prosecutor a list of people not to prosecute.\n\nTrump allies called for her removal, accusing her of criticizing the president to foreign officials, something current and former colleagues found inconceivable.\n\nGiuliani alleged she blocked efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nAccording to a White House summary, Trump described her as 'bad news' to Zelenskiy in the July call in which he sought Zelinskiy's help to investigate Biden and his son.\n\n'She's going to go through some things,' Trump added.\n\nNew York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat, said Yovanovitch occasionally had to leave the room because she was overcome with emotion as she was 'recounting how she was thrown to the wolves' in Ukraine.\n\n'It is clear to me that she was fired because she was a thorn in the side of those who sought to use the Ukrainian government for their own political and financial gain - and that includes President Trump,' Maloney said.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was launched after a whistleblower complaint about a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate Biden, a leading Democratic contender for the right to face Trump in the November 2020 election.\n\nDonald Trump recalled Yovanovitch to Washington, and Democrats want to know if he made the move because she was suspicious of his desire to see Joe Biden investigated for corruption\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable foreign ally to dig up dirt on a domestic political opponent for his own political benefit. Trump has denied he did anything wrong on the call.\n\nOn Thursday, two foreign-born Florida businessmen who had helped Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani investigate Biden were arrested in what prosecutors said was a scheme to illegally funnel money to a pro-Trump election committee and other U.S. political candidates.\n\nThe pair, Ukraine-born Lev Parnas and Belarus-born Igor Fruman, were arrested at an airport outside Washington carrying one-way tickets to Vienna. Prosecutors said they conspired to contribute foreign money, including at least $1 million from an unidentified Russian businessman, to candidates for federal and state offices to buy influence.\n\nThe two had donated $325,000 to a pro-Trump political action committee called America First Action in May 2018, and the money was falsely reported as coming from a purported natural gas company set up to conceal its true source, according to the indictment.\n\nThe investigation of Trump could lead to the approval of articles of impeachment \u2013 or formal charges \u2013 against the president in the House. A trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the U.S. Senate, where the Republicans who control the chamber have shown little appetite for ousting the president.\n\nOne of the foreign-born businessman arrested on Thursday, Parnas, sought the help of a U.S. congressman \u2013 identified by a person familiar with the matter as Republican Pete Sessions \u2013 to get Trump to remove Yovanovitch, according to the indictment.\n\nGiuliani told Reuters last week he had provided information to both Trump and the State Department about Yovanovitch, who he suggested was biased against Trump.\n\nSessions lost his House seat from Texas last year to a Democrat.\n\nIn a statement quoted by Politico, he said his motivation in urging the removal of Yovanovitch was his belief that 'political appointees should not be disparaging the president, especially while serving overseas.'", "description": "Gordon Sondland (right) is likely to tell lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week that he did not know if President Trump (left) was telling him the truth when he denied a quid pro quo with Ukraine.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com", "Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com", "David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/03/19643834-0-image-a-15_1570934910600.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
