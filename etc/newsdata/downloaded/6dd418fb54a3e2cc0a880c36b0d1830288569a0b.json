MUST WATCH See all the dramatic evidence in 'El Chapo's' trial 03:02\n\nBut Culiac\u00e1n is the heart of the cartel's territory and it responded to Guzman's capture by turning the city into a war zone\n\nGunbattles between authorities and criminals erupted city-wide. Armed with high-caliber rifles and automatic weapons, including what appeared in one video to be a truck-mounted machine gun, cartel members overwhelmed government forces with sheer firepower. Seven people -- including one civilian, a law enforcement officer and five so-called \"aggressors\" -- were killed, government officials said.\n\nOutmanned and outgunned, authorities were forced to release Guzman, a stunning admission of defeat.\n\nTwo years after Mexico extradited El Chapo to the United States, the cartel he left behind made a dramatic statement: that it, not the government, is in charge in Sinaloa.\n\nTaken together, the incidents illustrate Mexico's daily reality of unprecedented death and destruction -- and a government's inability to change that.\n\nA government claim to fix the problem\n\nWhen President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador took office last December, he became the latest Mexican leader forced to confront skyrocketing violence fueled by drug cartel activities around the country.\n\nBut AMLO, as he is often referred to, promised to do things differently. Whereas his predecessors \"fought fire with fire,\" AMLO would take a new tack.\n\nHis administration promised to address what it called the root causes of violence, namely economic insecurity. The approach would feature less armed conflict with cartels and try to solve the problem in a long-term way.\n\nOn his first day in office, he created a new national guard force tasked with ensuring short-term peace and security for beleaguered citizens.\n\nAnd in the wake of another wave of violent incidents this week, the President continues to insist his strategy will work.\n\n\"The strategies that were applied before turned our country into a cemetery and we don't want that anymore. I have said it a thousand times, nothing by force,\" he declared at a Friday morning news conference.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador made similar comments after the shootings in Guerrero and Michoac\u00e1n.\n\nNumbers don't lie\n\nAs the death toll continues to mount, maintaining support for arguments detailing long-term solutions becomes more tenuous.\n\nCritics argue that it's all well and good to want to tackle the problem of violence in a fundamental, systemic way. But not at the cost of essentially ignoring the fact that scores of people are dying every day.\n\n\"I do believe that the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration has a lot of good will to turn things around,\" said Falko Ernst, a Mexico security analyst for the Crisis Group. \"But they're so far completely missing the short-term component in their strategy. So we're looking at a patchy strategy that cannot work because it denies that force needs to play a role.\"\n\nErnst also argues that drug cartels, already sensing a longer leash from the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration, could take the government's capitulation in Culiac\u00e1n as a sign of immense weakness.\n\n\"It sets a dangerous precedent,\" said Ernst. \"The Mexican state has been successfully forced into submission and this could trigger repetition by other armed groups.\"\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador argued that releasing Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez was the right thing to do.\n\n\"The capture of a criminal cannot be worth more than the lives of the people,\" he said, citing the threat to innocent civilians during the shootout.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador was elected last year in a landslide and still enjoys broad popular support.\n\nBut more than 33,000 people were murdered in Mexico in 2018. That number will likely be eclipsed this year.\n\nIn the face of such death, how long will the public continue to support L\u00f3pez Obrador's game plan to stop it?\n\nIt's not clear. But as Mexicans wait for an answer, more people are dying in the drug-fueled violence that continues unabated.", "description": "In the past week in Mexico, 14 police officers and as many civilians were killed in separate incidents. Then cartel forces laid siege to an entire city as authorities tried to take custody of El Chapo's son. Can Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador still maintain his policy of \"nothing by force\" to combat the drug violence in his country?", "authors": ["Analysis Matt Rivers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191018082240-tiroteo-culiacan-mexico-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
