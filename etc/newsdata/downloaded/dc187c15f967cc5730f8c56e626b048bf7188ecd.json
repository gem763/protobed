According to the CDC, 610,000 die of heart disease and 735,000 suffer a heart attack annually.\n\nHeredity and increasing age play a role in your own personal risk of heart disease. You can\u2019t do much to change those, but there is a far greater number of risk factors that you do have control over. These include:\n\nSmoking\n\nChronic, uncontrolled stress\n\nObesity\n\nInactivity\n\nPoor diet (including excessive alcohol consumption)\n\nHigh blood pressure or cholesterol\n\nFirst things first in this heart health plan\u2014if you smoke, you obviously need to stop\u2026now. The benefits of kicking the habit start just 20 minutes after your last cigarette. In that short amount of time, your pulse and blood pressure return to normal. Just 12 hours after your last puff, elevated carbon monoxide blood levels drop back to normal. This means more oxygen in your blood and better heart function since your heart doesn\u2019t have to work as hard to pump oxygen through your body. After 24 hours, your risk of heart attack falls significantly. And the benefits become even more profound the longer you go without smoking.\n\nThere are many smoking cessation aids and programs that really work. If you need additional support, talk to your doctor. They should be just as invested in your success as you are.\n\nYou should also make an effort to reduce stress in your life. Stress doesn\u2019t directly cause heart disease, but it does have an impact on heart disease risk factors, including smoking, overeating, and overconsumption of alcohol. And internally, stress sets off a chain of events that causes high blood pressure. When your body releases adrenaline in response to stress, it not only leads to a rise in blood pressure, it increases heart and breathing rates. This is normal and fine during occasional instances of acute stress. But if it happens over and over, day after day\u2014as is often the cause with chronic stress\u2014it can eventually damage your arteries.\n\nSome good stress-busting techniques include exercise, deep breathing, meditation, yoga, tai chi, journaling, and professional counseling/therapy.\n\nThe rest of the risk factors for heart disease (obesity, inactivity, poor diet, and high blood pressure/cholesterol) can usually be controlled, even eliminated, with two things: eating a healthy diet, and engaging in regular exercise.\n\nA Heart-Healthy Diet\n\nNo one loves hearing that it takes a little bit of work and effort to keep your heart healthy. But the simple fact is, without proper diet and physical activity, your heart can\u2019t function at its best.\n\nThere\u2019s no magic food that on its own decreases the risk of heart disease. But there are many categories of foods that have properties shown to protect the heart. Some of them include:\n\nFish. Salmon, mackerel, tuna, herring, and sardines, in particular, contain heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce inflammation, keep blood vessels flexible, thin the blood (making it less likely to clot), increase beneficial HDL cholesterol, and lower dangerous triglycerides. In one meta-analysis that included 222,000 people, researchers found that consuming only one meal that contained fish weekly (compared to one fish meal per month) reduced risk of death from heart disease by 15 percent. And those who ate the most fish (five or more times per week) had an amazing 40 percent decrease in risk.\n\nSalmon, mackerel, tuna, herring, and sardines, in particular, contain heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce inflammation, keep blood vessels flexible, thin the blood (making it less likely to clot), increase beneficial HDL cholesterol, and lower dangerous triglycerides.

Olives (and olive oil) are especially good for you as they contain heart-friendly monounsaturated fats. Other choices for monounsaturated fats include avocados, nuts (walnuts, macadamia, etc.), and their oils.\n\nOlives (and olive oil) are especially good for you as they contain heart-friendly monounsaturated fats. Other choices for monounsaturated fats include avocados, nuts (walnuts, macadamia, etc.), and their oils. Fruits and vegetables (preferably fresh and organic). Antioxidants and vitamins such as folate found in all types of produce offer protection from heart disease. Fruits and vegetables (as well as whole grains) are also robust sources of fiber. According to a meta-analysis of 22 studies, for every 7 grams of additional fiber you consume every day, your risk of heart disease drops 9 percent. (Your goal should be around 30 grams of fiber daily.)\n\nModerate consumption of alcohol\u2014particularly red wine\u2014can also have protective effects on the heart. But you want to be careful to limit your intake to one glass a day at most.\n\nAll of these foods are staples in the Mediterranean diet\u2014an eating plan that has been shown time and again to improve heart health and reduce risk of several diseases. In fact, a meta-analysis that included more than 1.5 million people found that the Mediterranean diet reduced both overall mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease by 9 percent, as well as incidence of other diseases like cancer, Parkinson\u2019s, and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe easiest way to start eating a more heart-friendly diet is to ditch vegetable and canola oils and start using olive and avocado oils in your cooking and marinating. Instead of snacking on cookies, chips and other processed junk food, opt for cut up vegetables or a piece of fruit, or bake your own goodies using nut flours and low glycemic sweeteners like coconut sugar or stevia. Make vegetables the focus of most of your dishes, and for three or four dinners per week, swap out chicken, red meat, or pork for fish.\n\nTry also to consume less cow milk dairy. If you do eat it, opt for Greek yogurt or cheese, or dairy made from goat or sheep milk. And if you want to indulge in some alcohol on an occasional basis, choose heart-healthy red wine over beer or hard liquor.\n\nAnd it should go without saying: Avoid added sugars and processed food as best you can.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nMove Your Way to Better Heart Health\n\nThere\u2019s not much to add about exercise that you don\u2019t already know. Just as exercise strengthens the muscles in your legs, arms, core, and everywhere else, it strengthens your heart muscle and allows it to become more efficient at pumping blood throughout your body. This means that your heart pushes out more blood with each beat, beats slower, and works \u201cless hard,\u201d all of which keeps your blood pressure in check.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to become a marathon runner or Olympic weightlifter. All you need to do is get up and go for a walk every day for 15 or 20 minutes. Work your way up to longer stretches of exercise, and vary your movements over time. Go dancing one day, cycling the next, swimming the next, and so on.\n\n3 Key Supplements for Heart Health\n\nThere\u2019s one final piece in the heart disease prevention puzzle, and it\u2019s one that a lot of conventional doctors don\u2019t discuss\u2014heart-supportive supplements. Even if you do everything right with your diet and lifestyle, certain supplements move the dial from good to truly excellent heart health.\n\nThere are several supplements that benefit the heart, but three of the best are omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), and curcumin.\n\nYou can get your omega-3 essential fatty acids from fish, but a lot of people prefer not to each fish five times a week. Not to mention, there is the concern of mercury contamination. For this reason, taking omega-3s in supplement form is a great option. A good starting dose is 1,000\u20133,000 mg of the omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA daily (be sure to read labels for total EPA and DHA content per serving of oil).\n\nCoQ10 is an important antioxidant that fuels energy production in the cells\u2019 mitochondria\u2014which are responsible for up to 90 percent of the energy that cells need to stay alive.\n\nCoQ10 sparks the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the substance your body uses for energy. Of all the organs in your body, your heart relies on CoQ10 the most due to the extraordinary amount of energy it uses. This makes sense considering your heart is always beating and working hard to keep you alive. So, the higher the CoQ10 in your body, the more ATP the body can produce to fuel your heart.\n\nCoQ10 has been studied extensively for many heart-related issues. Studies have shown that it helps to lower LDL cholesterol, improve HDL cholesterol, reduce the risk of heart disease and heart attack, and protect the heart during a heart attack. Low levels of CoQ10 are linked to low levels of HDL cholesterol, which in and of itself raises the risk of heart disease.\n\nThe typical therapeutic dose of CoQ10 (as ubiquinol) is 300 mg daily, taken in divided doses. For general health and maintenance, a daily dose of 100 mg is sufficient.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s curcumin, the medicinal component of the bright yellow spice turmeric. You may be familiar with curcumin as a potent anti-inflammatory supplement. Chronic inflammation can encourage the development of plaque inside the arteries, reducing blood flow and overworking the heart. Reducing chronic inflammation helps prevent this process.\n\nBut curcumin has additional heart health benefits; it improves endothelial function and circulation and reduces \u201cstickiness\u201d between your blood cells, minimizing the likelihood of blood clots.\n\nIn a study of healthy middle-aged and older adults, those treated with 12 weeks of curcumin experienced improved endothelial function thanks to increased nitric oxide bioavailability and reduced oxidative stress.\n\nThe typical dose for curcumin is 500 mg two to three times per day.\n\nYour heart is an incredibly hard-working organ that needs proper care and nourishment. Following the steps outlined here, you can protect it now so it can reward you with excellent health for years to come.\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
