The 80 or so analysts and machine learning trainers will become part of the United Steelworkers Union.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honoured that HCL workers chose to join our union and our fight on behalf of all working people,\u201d USW International President Thomas M. Conway said in a statement. \u201cThey deserve to have their voices heard. Together, we\u2019ll make sure that they are.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s vote follows a union card-signing last month, which approximately two-thirds of the workforce at the Bakery Square, Pennsylvania, group participated in.\n\nAlthough Google is, like many big tech firms, thought of primarily as a business staffed by high-paid, highly pampered coders, half of the company\u2019s labour is provided by contractors. These second-class workers tend to lack the lush benefits and competitive pay of their peers, and despite doing work core to Google\u2019s business, Recode reported that some of these HCL contractors earn just $US40,000 ($58,832) per year.\n\nSome within Google\u2019s ranks, like security guards, have organised relatively recently, but as a whole, the company remains non-union by a wide margin \u2014 and according to the Steelworkers, the company was openly hostile to the prospect of these contractors setting a precedent\n\n\u201cHCL workers voted in favour of unionisation despite a company-led anti-union campaign, which included mandatory meetings and the use of a controversial management consultant,\u201d USW wrote in a press release following the vote. (HCL has disputed these characterizations.)\n\n\u201cWe work with lots of partners, many of which have unionised workforces, and many of which don\u2019t,\u201d Google spokesperson Jenn Kaiser told Gizmodo. \u201cAs with all our partners, whether HCL\u2019s employees unionise or not is between them and their employer. We\u2019ll continue to partner with HCL.\u201d\n\nGoogle has acted as something of a bellwether in the current climate of activism in big tech, where white-collar workers at the search giant have pushed back against working on a drone project for the Pentagon, the use of forced arbitration in employment contracts, and the company\u2019s impact on climate change \u2014 all of which presaged similar activism at other firms like Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce.\n\nThe unionisation vote also comes on the heels of organising campaigns at two other tech companies \u2014 a successful one at podcasting mainstay Gimlet, and a contentious, ongoing one at fundraising platform Kickstarter.\n\nFollowing certification by the National Labour Relations Board, the USW will \u201cfile a formal request with HCL for information to begin bargaining over wages, benefits and working conditions,\u201d a spokesperson told Gizmodo.\n\n\u201cWe fought for a seat at the table, and today we won,\u201d Joshua Borden, an HCL worker wrote. \u201cWe look forward to bargaining a contract that reflects our important contributions to HCL\u2019s continuing success.\u201d", "description": "A group of Pittsburgh-based Google contractors is among the first in the company\u2019s history to unionise, following a successful vote this afternoon, 49 to 24.
