Now, another robbery video has surfaced, where a woman shop owner bravely fought a thief and forced him to flee.\n\nThe thief was caught on camera jumping over the counter and snatching some bottles, before Jayne Callear put up a fight.\n\nIn the video that is now viral, you can see, she firmly held on to the culprit\u2019s coat, refusing to let go, even as he tries to wriggle free and escape from the Newswise newsagent shop in Newchapel.\n\nReportedly, the man entered the store and started inquiring for gifts for his parents' 50th wedding anniversary.\n\n\n\n\n\n55-year-old Jayne reportedly said, \u201cHe had already put biscuits on the counter when he started to ask for top-shelf alcohol. He was asking for them one by one, so I thought something was strange. I told him I would double-bag them and took the items off the till and put the bags on the floor under the counter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was using the stepladder for the top shelf, which blocked me inside the counter area. He came to the side of me asking for penny sweets. I knew it was because he wanted me to move the ladder,\u201d The Mirror quoted her as saying.\n\nDon't Miss 329 SHARES\n\nShe further said, \u201cHe asked how much his items came to and I told him it was around \u00a350. He picked up more items and then started to ask for bottles of wine. As I grabbed a second bottle, he jumped over the counter and grabbed the bags. \u201cI have always said that if someone came into the shop I would just let them take whatever they want, just leave me alone. It didn't work that way - I grabbed his coat and shouted at him.\"\n\nThe culprit is still on the loose and the police is looking for any information on him.", "description": "A few days ago a viral video surfaced that showed a receptionist pointing a gun back at the robber once he left it on the desk to collect cash.
