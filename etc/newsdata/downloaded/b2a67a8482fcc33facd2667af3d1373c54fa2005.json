However, I\u2019m a firm believer that everything happens for a reason, good or bad. So as much as my mind is racing at the moment, I know it will work out in my favor.\u201d\n\nHamstring and knee injuries cut Harrison\u2019s 2018 season short, as well.\n\nThe redshirt junior had just seven rushes for 70 yards this year, but the Terrapins will miss him nonetheless. This news comes a week after running back Jake Funk tore his ACL.\n\nMaryland still has Anthony McFarland Jr., Javon Leake and Tayon Fleet-Davis to run the ball, but the depth behind them is now shaky.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
