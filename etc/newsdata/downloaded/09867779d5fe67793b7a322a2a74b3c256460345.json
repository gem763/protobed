The records didn\u2019t stop there as they scored an impressive 85 goals this season.\n\nLAFC already had clinched the Supporter\u2019s Shield and a first-round bye in the MLS Cup playoffs.\n\nThey open the playoffs on October 23 or 24 against the winner of the first-round matchup between Minnesota United FC and Ibrahimovic\u2019s LA Galaxy.\n\nIbrahimovic didn\u2019t give up the scoring race without a fight. He scored his 30th in the ninth minute of a 4-2 loss to the Houston Dynamo on Sunday. The defeat means the Galaxy open the playoffs on the road.\n\nThe game marked the final MLS match for Houston player and former US national team member DaMarcus Beasley who left to a standing ovation in the 89th minute. Beasley is retiring after a 20-year career.\n\nThe career of Rapids goalkeeper Tim Howard also came to an end in Sunday\u2019s final day of the regular season.\n\nHoward, 40, will head into retirement after 185 MLS games, and 121 with the US national team.
