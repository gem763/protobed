Even though Aery, who keeps trying to wander off the couch, is a new addition to the family, both Rochow and Wheeler look relaxed for first-time \u2018parents\u2019.\n\nAery is their baby: they won\u2019t be having children. Rochow, 24, a graduate student in social work; Wheeler, 26, a high-school history teacher preparing for graduate school; and Aery, the nine-week-old puppy, make up a complete family unit.\n\n\u201cI feel like I would be giving up a lot of my life to be a parent,\u201d says Rochow. \u201cThat would cost money, that would cost time, that would cost things that you want to do.\u201d Wheeler adds that he\u2019d constantly worry about a child \u2013 \u201cmore so than most parents\u201d.\n\nBut \u201cbeing child-free, a puppy has always been on the radar,\u201d says Rochow, who knew she didn\u2019t want kids as early as high school. When she met Wheeler on Tinder at a music festival, he felt the same way about being child-free.", "description": "As the number of US couples without children increases, a growing number of them are favouring \u2013 and pampering \u2013 pets as they would kids.", "authors": ["Jessica Klein"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7l/np/p07lnpn1.jpg"}
