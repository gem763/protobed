Sandy Hooper, USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kawhi Leonard hit seven straight shots in one stretch, creating a run for the Los Angeles Clippers that his new teammates quickly joined.\n\n\"It's a great sign of leadership,\" coach Doc Rivers said. \"He talks with his game.\"\n\nLeonard began a new career chapter Tuesday night, scoring 30 points to go with a strong bench effort in a 112-102 victory over LeBron James and the Lakers in the teams' season opener.\n\nLeonard chose the Clippers because he wanted to come home and his family was on hand.\n\n\"All those emotions went through me again,\" he said.\n\nLou Williams added 21 points and Montrezl Harrell had 17 off the bench when the Clippers began their 50th season overall and 36th in Los Angeles as the once unlikely but now favorites to win the franchise's first NBA championship.\n\n\"It's one of 82 (games),\" Rivers said. \"Next question.\"\n\nKawhi's @LAClippers debut \u2705\n\n\n\nHe dropped 30 PTS and #ClipperNation leads 1-0 in the battle of L.A! pic.twitter.com/eQQmK6h0aS \u2014 NBA TV (@NBATV) October 23, 2019\n\nLeonard won his second NBA title last season in Toronto.\n\nThe Lakers showed off their new 1-2 punch of James and Anthony Davis. Davis scored 25 points, making 9-of-14 free throws, and James had 18.\n\n\"For us, we're both aggressive,\" Davis said. \"Sometimes we kind of miss each other. I missed him a couple times and he missed me, so just trying to figure it out.\"\n\nDanny Green outscored them both with 28 points, including seven 3-pointers, in the highest-scoring debut by a Laker in franchise history.\n\nLeonard got it done without his personal recruit Paul George, sidelined indefinitely while rehabbing from a pair of offseason shoulder surgeries.\n\n\"It's just the first game of the season, so it's going to take the season and mistakes and success to get us on the same page,\" Leonard said.\n\nWearing a black tuxedo jacket and bow tie, George received a mixed reaction when introduced in the playoff-like atmosphere at Staples Center, where the Clippers were the home team for the first of four meetings in the arena the teams share.\n\nKawhi Leonard said he wasn\u2019t sure Lakers fans were booing him or Clippers fans were cheering for him.

Last season, Williams and Harrell were the NBA's highest-scoring reserve duo, and they picked up where they left off.\n\n\"This bench is going to be better this year than even last year,\" Rivers said.\n\nIt came down to the fourth quarter, and the Clippers dominated.\n\nTied 85-all, they opened with a 19-7 run to go up 104-92. Five different players scored and Leonard assisted on Maurice Harkless' 3-pointer.\n\nJames had three of the Lakers' six turnovers in the fourth, when Harkless and Leonard each blocked shots by Dwight Howard.\n\n\"That was just very careless and they capitalized off of it,\" James said.\n\nWith 4\u00bd minutes left, Lakers fans chanted \"Let's go Lakers! Let's go Lakers!\" while others hit the exits.\n\n\"The NBA's back and everyone's trying to have the narrative of it's a rivalry game and it's a huge test,\" James said, \"but I think both teams are not where they want to be. We have a lot of room to improve.\"\n\nBOLD PREDICTIONS: Looking into the crystal ball for 2019-20 season\n\nWHO WE'RE WATCHING: The 25 most interesting players for 2019-20\n\nTORONTO: Raptors get title rings, then remind NBA \"we're still good\"\n\nThe Lakers erased a 14-point deficit in the third, led by Danny Green's 18 points. He capped a 15-0 run with his fifth 3-pointer before JaMychal Green's 3-pointer pulled the Clippers into an 85-all tie heading into the fourth.\n\nThe Clippers outscored the Lakers 40-29 in the second quarter, buoyed by 16 points from Leonard. He made seven straight shots on a variety of moves \u2014 pullups, fadeaways, a cutting dunk.\n\nThe Lakers raced to a 13-2 lead, their largest of the game. James scored over Leonard and he later heard \"MVP! MVP!\" chants while sinking his first free throws of the season.\n\nThe Lakers shot 53% from the floor in the first quarter, while the Clippers missed shots and had a basket by Williams taken away when the Lakers challenged a foul call on Howard.\n\nThe rivalry was on early with a male fan shouting \"Go Lakers!\" during the national anthem, drawing big cheers while Clipper fans booed.\n\n\"It was everything I expected,\" Davis said. \"Very anticipated game and it was fun.\"\n\nCLOSE SportsPulse: Trysta Krick and Mark Medina break down the Los Angeles Clippers who all of a sudden find themselves at the top of the crop with the additions of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George .
