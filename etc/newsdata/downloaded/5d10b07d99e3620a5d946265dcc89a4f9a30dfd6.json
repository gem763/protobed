At least nine people died and more than 200 were injured due to riots in Jakarta following the fraught campaign, during which Subianto accused Widodo\u2019s government of hosting a \u201cmassive, systematic and fraudulent\u201d election.\n\nNews of Subianto\u2019s expected appointment has caused unrest among many Widodo supporters. Public unease over Subianto wielding power over the armed forces derives from his previous military record. A former son-in-law of the late Indonesian dictator Suharto, Subianto was accused of orchestrating the kidnapping and torture of activists ahead of anti-government demonstrations in 1998 when he was an army commander. He has never been charged in relation to the alleged incidents.\n\n'Don't teach me democracy!': an uneasy audience with Indonesia's Prabowo Read more\n\nAhead of Subianto\u2019s appointment, Usman Hamid, Amnesty International\u2019s Indonesia executive, said \u201cit would be a dark day for human rights in this country\u201d if he got the defence job.\n\nThe election campaign fought between Subianto and Widodo was marred by a flood of misinformation. However since the result was announced the pair have appeared together in public, with Subianto saying on Monday that his party, Gerindra, was \u201cready to help if asked\u201d to bolster the cabinet of the president\u2019s coalition government.\n\nWhen Subianto\u2019s defence minister position was officially announced Widodo said: \u201cI believe I don\u2019t have to tell him about his job \u2013 he knows more than I do.\u201d\n\nJoko Widodo: how 'Indonesia's Obama' failed to live up to the hype Read more\n\nElsewhere in the cabinet Widodo focused on appointing professionals rather than political party members. Nadiem Makarim, co-founder of ride-hailing company Gojek, was made education and culture minister. Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the former World Bank managing director, was reappointed finance minister.\n\nAs his second term begins, Widodo, 58, faces many challenges beyond his main stated goal of improving the nation\u2019s economy. This month a suspected Isis radical attacked his chief security minister and violence broke out in Papua as protestors marched against alleged abuses by officials and demanded Papuan independence.\n\nWidodo has also faced a public backlash over a proposed draconian penal code amendment that would criminalise publicly criticising the Indonesian government and court system. The move has been branded undemocratic by law experts.", "description": "General who has been accused of abuses is named in cabinet of Joko Widodo, against whom he ran for president", "authors": ["Jamie Fullerton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98e1d57665643020f97599d39c05cb18a7821ddf/0_0_4738_2843/master/4738.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f741d20625e24536465d2ed045094918", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
