Only thing is that they should have not done it. For that they apologised so we accept it,\" said Saeed Uddin, the honorary secretary of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong.\n\nPolice also expressed regret at a press briefing on Monday amid ongoing anger at alleged misconduct during months of protests in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\n\n\u201cTo any people or any groups that were affected, we offer our genuine apologies,\u201d said Cheuk Hau-yip, the Kowloon West regional commander.\n\nHe insisted officers did not have \u201cmalicious intent\u201d.\n\nA video filmed by Hong Kong politician Jeremy Tam showed a police water cannon truck spraying the blue liquid at a handful of people standing in front of the mosque\u2019s gate on Sunday. The liquid, used to identify protesters, was reported to be water containing a blue dye and a painful pepper solution\n\nThe mosque\u2019s front steps and metal gate and the adjoining pavement were stained with the liquid, while people hit by the solution were left gagging and coughing, according to the video.\n\nMr Tam said he and two other people, an Indian businessman and the head of a charity for ethnic minorities, went to hospital for checks following the incident.\n\nVolunteers reportedly later arrived to help clean the mosque and by Monday morning the blue stains was largely gone.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Hong Kong said it understood the mosque was not targeted by police.\n\n\u201cThe police gave prior notice as it approached the area before the use of coloured water. The police then used blue water to disperse people outside the mosque, leaving the gates of the mosque stained,\u201d the council added in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt has undoubtedly stirred feelings amongst the Muslim and non-Muslims community in Hong Kong but let us not make the situation worse.\u201d\n\nHong Kong protesters have seized on the incident as the latest example of overly aggressive police tactics. The pro-democracy movement has called for broader political rights and police accountability in the city, which has seen unrest and major demonstrations since early June.\n\nPolice have accused protesters of being \u201crioters\u201d and arrested 68 people over the weekend.\n\nThey said demonstrators hurled more than 100 fire bombs and damaged more than 100 sets of traffic lights.\n\nHong Kong is home to more than 300,000 Muslims, according to the Islamic Community Fund, which runs the city\u2019s five mosques and two Muslim cemeteries.\n\nThe treatment of Muslims in China has come under scrutiny in recent years due to alleged human rights abuse of Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minority groups.\n\nIn July, ambassadors from 22 countries, including the UK, France and Germany, raised concerns about \u201clarge-scale places of detention\u201d targeting Uighurs in Xinjiang province.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\nRead more\n\nHong Kong activist stabbed as thousands of protesters and police clash\n\nChina bans shipment of black clothing and masks to Hong Kong\n\nWhat Hong Kongers really think of the protesters and the police\n\nChaos in Hong Kong as Lam forced to abandon \u2018state of union\u2019 address\n\nHong Kong protesters burn LeBron James jersey over free speech comment\n\nHomemade bomb targets riot police as violence escalates in Hong Kong", "description": "Hong Kong\u2019s top official has apologised to Muslim leaders after riot police fired blue dye at a mosque with a water cannon during pro-democracy demonstrations.Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, and the city\u2019s head of police visited Kowloon mosque on Monday to express regret to the chief imam and", "authors": ["Conrad Duncan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/X5HiP0ARF21uzVOQivVlJQ--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/ed88848a65e892ae342c3cfaf55f22c1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
