WATCH\n\nKwaZulu-Natal snake catcher Nick Evans faced an unusual challenge when he was called out to remove five black mambas from a single Durban property in June.\n\n\"It was very exciting for me,\" said Evans who owns the KZN Amphibian and Reptile Conservation.\n\nEvans described the property in Reservoir Hills as a \"snake magnet\".\n\n\"There were two males on the property and one female. The two males were wrestling one another.\"\n\nHe told News24 on his first visit he was able to catch one male and the female, but the second male managed to slither away.\n\nThe homeowners then resorted to burning the thick vegetation to get rid of the strong scent.\n\n\"A week later, I was called back for another snake sighting. We were able to track down a male black mamba that had been hiding behind two walls.\"\n\nOn the eighth day, Evans said he caught a fifth snake on the property.\n\n\"We also had a bit of rain that week that I think managed to get rid of the female's scent,\" he explained.\n\nEvans said black mamba sightings were common during the months of June and July as a result of the mating season.\n\n\"The female's scent is like a snake magnet that keeps the males coming back,\" he said.", "description": "KZN snake catcher Nick Evans faced an unusual challenge when he was called out to remove five black mambas from a single Durban property.
