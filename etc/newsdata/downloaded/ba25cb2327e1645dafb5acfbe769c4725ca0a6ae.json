They suffer like us -- they should help and protect us,\" said protester Abu Jaafar.\n\nThe demonstrations have left 31 people dead, including two police officers, and more than 1,000 people have been wounded.\n\nANGER BOILS OVER\n\nProtests began Tuesday in Baghdad and spread across the mainly Shiite south. Several cities have imposed curfews but protesters have flooded the streets regardless.\n\nMeanwhile the Kurdish northern regions and Sunni western provinces have remained relatively calm.\n\nThe grievances echo those of mass demonstrations in Iraq's south just over a year ago, prompted by a severe water shortage that caused a health crisis.\n\nSince then, southern provinces have accused the central government of failing to address profound infrastructural gaps.\n\nIn particular, anger has boiled over at the staggering level of youth unemployment, which is around 25 per cent, or double the overall rate, according to the World Bank.\n\nTensions have been exacerbated by the closure of government offices and calls by firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr for \"a general strike\".\n\nThe cleric was behind major protests in Baghdad in 2016 when his supporters stormed the city's Green Zone, home to some ministries and embassies.\n\nHis involvement appears much more limited this time, but if his followers join the protests en masse the rallies will likely balloon even further.\n\nA signal is also anticipated from the country's top Shiite religious authority, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, which could come in his weekly Friday sermon.\n\nOver half of those killed in the last three days have been in the southern city of Nasiriyah, where seven protesters were shot dead and dozens wounded on Thursday alone.\n\n'DRACONIAN MEASURES'\n\nWith internet access virtually shut off, demonstrators have struggled to communicate with each other or post footage of the latest clashes.\n\nApproximately 75 per cent of Iraq is \"offline\" after major network operators \"intentionally restricted\" access, according to monitor NetBlocks.\n\nThe United Nations, European Union and United Kingdom have all appealed for calm, while rights group Amnesty International slammed the response to protests.\n\n\"It is outrageous that Iraqi security forces time and again deal with protesters with such brutality using lethal and unnecessary force,\" said Amnesty's Lynn Maalouf.\n\nShe said the internet blackout was a \"draconian measure... to silence protests away from cameras and the world's eyes\".\n\nThe protests appear to be largely spontaneous and decentralised, using virtually no slogans or party insignia.\n\nInstead, demonstrators have brandished posters demanding a \"real country\" and even pictures of an Iraqi general who was recently decommissioned after reported pressure by pro-Iran factions.\n\nSeveral Iraqis said they received on Thursday text messages from Mr Abdel Mahdi's office giving a number for a hotline that protesters could call to air their grievances.\n\nMr Abdel Mahdi came to power in October 2018 as a consensus candidate after last year's mass demonstrations effectively ended his predecessor Haider al-Abadi's chances at a second term.\n\nHe pledged to reform inefficient institutions, eradicate corruption and fight unemployment - unfulfilled promises that appear to have pushed protesters over the edge this week.\n\nIn his speech on Friday, the prime minister insisted security forces were abiding by \"international standards\" in how they were dealing with protesters.\n\nHe had previously infuriated many by blaming the violence on \"aggressors who... deliberately created casualties\".\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [BAGHDAD] Thousands of protesters clashed with riot police in Iraq's capital and across the south on Thursday, the third day of mass rallies that have left 31 dead. .
