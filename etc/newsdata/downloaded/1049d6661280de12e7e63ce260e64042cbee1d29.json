We also don't sell our technology.\"\n\nPeople new to Facebook or who had the \"tag\" feature operating will get word from the social network about the face recognition setting along with an easy way to turn it on if they wish, according to Narayanan.\n\n\"People will still be able to manually tag friends, but we won't suggest you to be tagged if you do not have face recognition turned on,\" Mr Narayanan said.\n\n\"If you already have the face recognition setting, you won't receive a notice.\"\n\nThe move comes amid growing concerns about facial recognition technology by law enforcement and government agencies, and with widespread use of the system for surveillance in parts of the world including China.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Technology - [SAN FRANCISCO] Facebook on Tuesday said facial recognition technology applied to photos at the social network will be an opt-in feature. .
