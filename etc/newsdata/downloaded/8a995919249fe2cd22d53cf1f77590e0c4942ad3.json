Coach Bruce Arians said the wind was sending the ball two or three yards in different directions on passes at times.\n\n\u201cIt was fun to play in a different atmosphere,\u201d quarterback Jameis Winston said. \u201cA lot of us said it\u2019s kind of chilly with the wind. In Tampa it\u2019s a hot breeze. There are no cold breezes there.\u201d\n\nThe Bucs held their only practice in London before Sunday\u2019s game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium against the Carolina Panthers. They left home Thursday and took the overnight flight to England, forcing players to acclimate to a new time zone.\n\nReceiver Chris Godwin said the practice was a little different than a normal one as players tried to get their legs back after spending so many hours on a plane. But he expects everyone to be back to normal by game time Sunday.\n\n\u201cYou kind of have to,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you step on the field, it\u2019s football. All this extra stuff on the outside is cool, but once the whistle starts blowing, it\u2019s time to play.\u201d\n\nCarolina arrived a day earlier for the game than the Bucs, following a schedule Seattle used successfully on the way to beating the Raiders. The Panthers spent Thursday doing a walk-through and then helping out at an NFL-sponsored flag football event for local kids.\n\nThey then returned to their temporary practice site for the week at the prestigious Harrow School outside of London on Friday for their final practice before the game.\n\nThe school educated several prime ministers, including Winston Churchill, as well as princes and other royalty around the world. The school was also used as the scene in a Harry Potter movie. While coach Ron Rivera enjoyed the historic aspect of it, the main purpose for the Panthers this week was using the school as a practice facility.\n\nRivera also wanted to make sure his players also took time to enjoy themselves in a new country when they get the chance, telling them to \u201cbe where your feet are\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo wherever you are, focus in on wherever you are 100%,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on the practice fields, when you\u2019re in the meeting room, when you\u2019re on the game field, be where you are. When you\u2019re not, be with your family, your friends and around town, enjoy that. It\u2019s a great experience and for some of these guys, it might be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\u201d\n\nThe Panthers got good news on the injury front with star running back Christian McCaffrey able to be a full participant on Friday after missing Wednesday\u2019s practice with a sore back.\n\nMcCaffrey is off to an impressive start this season with 866 yards from scrimmage, the second most through five games in NFL history to Jim Brown\u2019s 988 yards in 1963.\n\nThe only team to hold McCaffrey to less than 175 yards from scrimmage and the only team to keep him out of the end zone in a game this season was Tampa Bay in Week 2, when the Bucs limited him to 53 total yards in a 20-14 win in a Thursday night home game.\n\nMcCaffrey has 604 yards from scrimmage and five TDs in the three games since that loss at Carolina.\n\n\u201cEverything I\u2019ve seen on the film, I didn\u2019t like, because he\u2019s running for touchdowns all the time,\u201d Bucs defensive coordinator Todd Bowles said. \u201c(They\u2019re doing) nothing different. Like I said, they\u2019re running the ball a lot better. You can tell they\u2019ve come together as a unit and they understand who they are and they do it very well.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After an overnight flight across the Atlantic Ocean and a few hours of rest, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quickly got their welcome-to-London moment.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/buccaneers_panthers_football_37420_c0-266-4211-2722_s1200x700.jpg?3a2013a6904855529cea837c324b274ef05368ee", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
