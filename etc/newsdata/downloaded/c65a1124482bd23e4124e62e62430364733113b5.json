He again reported his concerns to NSC\u2019s lead counsel, he said.\n\nHe wrote, \u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nVindman, who arrived in the United States as a 3-year-old from the former Soviet Union, served in various military and diplomatic posts before joining the NSC. He was the director for European affairs and a Ukraine expert under Fiona Hill, a former official who testified earlier in the impeachment probe. Hill worked for former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nVindman will be a key witness. He attended Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration with a delegation led by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and he and Hill were both part of a Ukraine briefing with Sondland that others have testified irritated Bolton at the White House.\n\nVindland will testify that he is not the whistleblower, the still unnamed government official who filed the initial complaint over Trump\u2019s conversation with the Ukraine president that sparked the House impeachment inquiry. He will say he does not know who the whistleblower is.\n\n\u201cI am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics,\u201d wrote Vindman, who was wounded in Iraq and awarded a Purple Heart.\n\n\u201cFor over twenty years as an active duty United States military officer and diplomat, I have served this country in a nonpartisan manner, and have done so with the utmost respect and professionalism for both Republican and Democratic administrations,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe testimony is expected the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House will vote on a resolution to affirm the impeachment investigation, set rules for public hearings and outline the potential process for writing articles of impeachment against Trump. The vote is expected Thursday.\n\nAt its core, the impeachment inquiry is looking into Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy, when he asked the new Ukraine president for a \u201cfavor\u201d in what Democrats say was a quid pro quo that could be an impeachable offense.\n\nPelosi\u2019s announcement Monday came just hours after a former White House national security official defied a House subpoena for closed-door testimony, escalating the standoff between Congress and the White House over who will testify.\n\nCharles Kupperman, who was a deputy to Bolton, failed to show up for the scheduled closed-door deposition after filing a lawsuit asking a federal court in Washington to rule on whether he was legally required to appear.\n\nThe argument advanced by Kupperman\u2019s lawyers turns on his status as a close adviser to the president and may not be available for other administration officials who are lower down the executive branch organization chart or who did not have regular contact with Trump.\n\nDemocrats have indicated they are likely to use no-show witnesses to write an article of impeachment against Trump for obstruction of justice, rather than launching potentially lengthy court battles to obtain testimony.", "description": "A 20-year military officer will testify in the House impeachment inquiry that he twice raised concerns over the Trump administration\u2019s interest in having...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ717_19trum_ZG_20190904201152.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
