(Oct. 29) AP, AP\n\nThis just in! Reviews for \"The Morning Show,\" that is.\n\nThe star-studded Apple TV+ series featuring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell follows a newsroom that is rocked by a sexual misconduct scandal, similar to the real-life drama involving former \"Today\" co-anchor Matt Lauer.\n\nMost critics, however, say the show's muddled storyline is lacking, despite the star power. \"Morning Show\" has a Metacritic rating of 57 out of 100 and is listed as 57% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter's Daniel Fienberg says the cast couldn't mask the series' failed attempt to \"find its focus, tone and attitude toward its main characters.\" He called the first episode \"brutally dull\" and concluded the \"meandering second episode\" wasn't much better.\n\nOnly in the the third episode does the series get \"more satisfying and confident,\" but is it too late? Fienberg asks, \"Did the behemoths at Apple really get into the crowded original TV marketplace to become the latest perpetrator of 'It eventually gets better!' patience-testing?\"\n\nJennifer Aniston returns to TVin Apple's 'Morning Show' trailer with Carrell and Witherspoon\n\nReese Witherspoon (L) and Jennifer Aniston attend Apple's global premiere of \"The Morning Show\" on October 28, 2019 in New York City.

In a damning piece of Hollywood myopia, we have two elite white actresses sharing anchor duties,\" he says. \"Several minority characters are passed over for the position, and this narrative blunder exacerbates the overall dated look and feel of 'The Morning Show.'\"\n\nThe reviews weren't all negative.\n\nThe AV Club's Alex McLevy says the show \"has the addictive rush of great old-school TV dramas\" despite a slow start. It's \"funny, biting, and with just the right dose of trashy zing, this is high-gloss soap \u2013 'Broadcast News' meets 'L.A. Law.'\"\n\nMcLevy adds that \"the only thing keeping Aniston from being the best part of this series is (Billy) Crudup,\" who plays network executive Cory Ellison.\n\nThe first three episodes of \"The Morning Show\" premiere on Apple TV+ Friday, while the remaining seven episodes will be released weekly.\n\nContributing: Hannah Yasharoff\n\nSee our full coverage of entertainment news\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/30/morning-show-reviews-critics-say-newsroom-drama-brutally-dull/4102178002/", "description": "This just in!
