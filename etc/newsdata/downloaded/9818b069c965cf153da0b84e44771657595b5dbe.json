Malcolm Gladwell Has Some Ideas", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s a fair point, if a fairly obvious one, but Gladwell leads up to this moment by dispensing suggestive morsels of theory, like a trail of bread crumbs; his italicized conclusions are designed to hit us with the force of revelation when it finally dawns on us how everything fits together.\n\nAmping up the drama like this doesn\u2019t have to feel cheap; there\u2019s a fine tradition of storytelling as benign manipulation, and in his articles for The New Yorker, Gladwell often gets the balance right. But not here. In \u201cTalking to Strangers,\u201d he uses theory like a cudgel on sensitive material. A chapter on the Stanford rape case from 2015 is a prime example. A jury convicted Brock Turner, a freshman, of sexually assaulting Chanel Miller (who recently revealed her name to the public and whose memoir will be published later this month). Gladwell deems what happened between them that night a case of \u201ctransparency failure on steroids.\u201d\n\n\u201cA young woman and a young man meet at a party,\u201d Gladwell writes, \u201cthen proceed to tragically misunderstand each other\u2019s intentions \u2014 and they\u2019re drunk.\u201d This is a bizarre way to describe a situation that ended with a conscious Turner being found on top of an unconscious Miller behind a dumpster. He had pulled down her dress, removed her underwear and assaulted her with his fingers. In what universe is this the result of a tragic misunderstanding?\n\nThis is where Gladwell\u2019s insistence on theory can be distorting, rather than clarifying. Theory can provide a handy framework, transforming the messy welter of experience into something more legible, but it can also impose a narrative that\u2019s awkward, warped or even damaging. Gladwell himself seems to realize as much. His 2000 book \u201cThe Tipping Point\u201d endorsed the \u201cbroken windows\u201d theory that aggressive policing of minor infractions can prevent more serious crimes; years later, as debates about mass incarceration came to the fore, he conceded that the theory was \u201coversold,\u201d and that he regretted his part in promoting it.\n\nIn \u201cTalking to Strangers,\u201d there are glimpses of this mildly chastened Gladwell, more skeptical of theory\u2019s explanatory powers and struggling to break free. He begins and ends his book with the story of Sandra Bland, who was pulled over for failing to signal a lane change and later died in police custody, in what officials deemed a suicide. Bland was black; the officer who pulled her over, Brian Encinia, was white. Gladwell slips in a \u201ccautionary note,\u201d saying that for all the theory he presents \u201cthe right way to talk to strangers is with caution and humility.\u201d\n\nBut this anodyne sentiment is too vague and banal to explain anything, much less carry a book, and Gladwell knows it. In his strenuous bids for novelty, he has to minimize existing explanations of Encinia as a racist and a bully (\u201cwe can do better\u201d), concluding instead that the best way to understand Encinia is as \u201cthe police officer who does not default to truth.\u201d", "description": "In his newest book, \u201cTalking to Strangers,\u201d Gladwell looks at the challenge of figuring out whom we should trust \u2014 and whom we shouldn\u2019t.", "authors": ["Jennifer Szalai"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/books/04bookgladwell1/04bookgladwell1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
