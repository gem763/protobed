(The couple considered France, too \u2014 Tricia is fluent in French \u2014 but it was too expensive, as well as Spain, which didn\u2019t pan out because none of their requests to rent a place worked out.)\n\nTheir first foray into Portugal \u2014 to a tiny village about a half-hour from Porto in northwest Portugal \u2014 didn\u2019t quite go as planned.\n\n\u201cWe lived in a 200-year-old cottage that we\u2019d rented 10 years before. We had a six-month lease. After five months, we were done,\u201d she tells MarketWatch with a laugh, noting that she was frequently freezing in the $650-a-month cottage, which was charming but drafty, even with numerous space heaters running. \u201cThey were happy to see us go because the electricity was included [in the rent].\u201d\n\nTricia Pimental In the early days in Portugal, Pimental was on the fence about it.\n\nNot to mention that she briefly felt depressed and missed her family: \u201cIn quiet moments I grieved the loss of my life back home, lamenting the distance between me and my children and grandchildren,\u201d she writes in a book she penned about her travel adventures, \u201cA Movable Marriage: A Memoir.\u201d\n\nBut even as she was missing family, and shivering, Portugal, and in particular the Portuguese people, were growing on her. \u201cIt\u2019s all about family, food and fun,\u201d she says, adding that the people she\u2019s encountered are friendly and up for helping one another. She shares a story of going to an equestrian show some years back and there being a parked car that was blocking a horse trailer from getting through to the stables. \u201cThe police enlisted six dudes \u2014 and they pick up the car and move it, the horse trailer goes by, and they put the car back. No ticket, no towing, no boot \u2014 just a let\u2019s-take-care-of-it attitude,\u201d she says.\n\nTricia Pimental A field in the Alentejo region of southern Portugal.\n\nTricia, who is now a Portugal correspondent for International Living, and Keith have lived in a few spots in Portugal \u2014 their most recent home being on a quinta they bought for about $250,000 in the countryside of the Castelo Branco District of central Portugal. She highlights the weather (\u201cfour seasons, but no extremes\u201d), the beautiful nearby villages and their smattering of castles, and the river beaches and reservoirs where locals swim. The five-bedroom, four-bath house \u2014 which is only about 10 years old \u2014 itself sits on about 5 acres, featuring a vineyard, as well as roughly 50 olive trees (last year, the couple made their own olive oil).\n\nHere\u2019s what their life is like \u2014 from costs to health care to the pros and cons ...\n\nThe cost: Tricia says that, in general in Portugal, you could spend about one-third to one-quarter of what you would in the U.S., depending on where you live. Cities, including Lisbon, are pricey, but in the countryside \u201cyou can easily get by on $2,000 a month,\u201d she says.\n\nShe and Keith \u2014 who just acquired another home across the street from their quinta, too \u2014 spend more, she says, estimating that they drop about $3,500 a month. That\u2019s because they often travel and recently bought a car, which she says is costly to do in Portugal \u2014 and fuel is expensive on top of that. Tricia says internet and phone costs come to a little under $100 a month, and groceries cost $400 to $500 a month. Wine is particularly inexpensive, she says, adding that for about $5 you can get a really good table wine that you might pay $15 for in the U.S. A fair budget for entertainment might be $200 to $300 a month, she says, and you can rent a small house for about $350 to $400 a month.\n\nTricia Pimental The Torre de Bel\u00e9m in Lisbon has been a Unesco World Heritage site since the 1980s.\n\nHealth care: Portugal is known for its high-quality health care \u2014 in a study of health-care quality and access in 191 countries published in the U.K. medical journal the Lancet, Portugal, like the U.S., is in the 82.2-to-91.3 decile range. But you may pay much less for health care in Portugal. Tricia says that she and Keith get their health insurance through a private company called Medis and pay about $100 a month for their coverage. Paying out of pocket for a doctor\u2019s visit might cost $20 to $70 even without insurance, she says. (Tricia points out that if you get your temporary residence card, you can use Portugal\u2019s low-cost public health system.)\n\nResidency: The couple are not citizens of Portugal, and Tricia says the process of getting to this point has been challenging. \u201cIf you could see my eyes roll,\u201d Tricia tells me on our phone call when I ask her how the process is going. \u201cIt has been going on for a while. ... We are on our third lawyer.\u201d Here are details on how you can become a permanent resident of Portugal.\n\nThe cons: \u201cI\u2019ve never been a big fish person; I don\u2019t eat a lot of it,\u201d says Tricia \u2014 and Portuguese food often features fish (bacalhau, which is salted cod, is a particularly popular local dish). \u201cI would much rather be in Italy for pizza and pasta.\u201d However, she says she likes that Portuguese food is fresh and simple. Another downside: Many of the homes in Portugal are older, and Tricia jokes that \u201cyou won\u2019t find a single outlet in the bathroom, but then there will be like 15 in another room.\u201d And, again, they can be chilly in the winter. What\u2019s more, electricity costs a lot in Portugal. Here are some other downsides.\n\nAnother possible hiccup for those looking to retire in Portugal is the language barrier. Tricia studied languages in college, so it has been relatively easier for her to learn Portuguese (when I ask her if she\u2019s fluent she responds \u201cMais o menos\u201d \u2014 \u201cmore or less\u201d), but others struggle.\n\nThe bottom line: Despite drawbacks, Tricia says Portugal feels more like home to her now than America. \u201cIt is more true than ever now that the U.S. doesn\u2019t feel like home,\u201d she says. \u201cI hate going back to the U.S. because I feel it is busy, rushed, dangerous and unfriendly. I wonder: What is going to happen next?\u201d Tricia, who goes back to the U.S. two or three times a year to visit her children and grandchildren, reports. \u201cMore and more, I fly over Lisbon, I look at the beaches, I look out at the water, I just go, \u2018Ahhhhh, I am home.\u2019 \u201d", "description": "The pros and cons of living in Portugal.", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS433_tricia_ZG_20191001161901.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
