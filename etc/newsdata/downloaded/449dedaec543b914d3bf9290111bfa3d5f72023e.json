REUTERS/John Morris/File Photo\n\nPolls show the Conservatives have a chance to beat the ruling Liberals provided they are able to make inroads in Toronto, Canada\u2019s largest city, where shooting deaths have spiked this year amid clashes between gangs.\n\nScheer\u2019s vow to get tough on crime was overshadowed by the revelation that he is also a U.S. citizen. After the Globe and Mail newspaper broke the news on Thursday, Scheer said he was giving up his American citizenship.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal to have dual citizenship here in Canada,\u201d he told reporters, who asked him whether he had ever filed taxes in the United States or registered for the U.S. military draft at 18.\n\nScheer instead took aim at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is trying to recover from images showing him dressed in blackface, and accused him of breaking promises to eliminate the budget deficit and make life more affordable.\n\n\u201cWhen Canadians are looking at what he is offering this election, they know they cannot trust him,\u201d Scheer said.\n\nTrudeau told reporters in Quebec City that Scheer needed to be honest with Canadians about his dual citizenship and noted that he had apologized repeatedly for the blackface incidents.\n\n\u201cMr. Scheer continues to not take responsibility for his choices of the past, his actions of the past, his mistakes of the past,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nScheer earlier on Friday told a Toronto news conference that the Conservatives would introduce a five-year minimum mandatory prison sentence for violent gang crime, and the same penalty for possession of a smuggled firearm.\n\nScheer\u2019s chances of victory could be increased if disaffected Liberals decide to stay home or choose not to vote for Trudeau.\n\nIn a move that could alienate indigenous voters, the federal government said on Friday it would appeal a human rights ruling last month that ordered Ottawa to compensate aboriginal children who had been removed from their homes and put into welfare.\n\nTrudeau told reporters that while he agrees with the idea of compensation, the government needed time to consult with its partners. Such talks could not take place during an election campaign, he added.\n\nScheer said on Friday he agreed with the idea of an appeal.", "description": "Andrew Scheer, the head of Canada's opposition Conservatives, on Friday promised a crime crackdown if he won an Oct. 21 election, but faced repeated questions about why he had not revealed that he has dual U.S. citizenship.", "authors": ["Steve Scherer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437104033&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF931DM", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
