Esper and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, disclosed the decision on Friday evening, with Mr. Esper framing the action as \u201cdefensive in nature.\u201d General Dunford said that the precise number of American troops headed to the region has not been determined, but that it would be a \u201cmoderate deployment\u201d in the hundreds, not thousands.\n\nThe announcement came as Mr. Trump is weighing whether to take direct military action against Iran in response to the attacks on Saudi Arabia, which rattled global energy markets and which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week called \u201can act of war.\u201d\n\nAt the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump said that he could order a retaliatory strike in an instant, but that his current restraint should be seen as a sign of toughness.", "description": "The administration is not ruling out military strikes.
