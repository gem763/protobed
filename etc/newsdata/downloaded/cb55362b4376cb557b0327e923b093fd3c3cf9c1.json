Look what is happening in Germany,\u201d he urged, insisting that social costs outweight any advantages Western Europe\u2019s multicultural states may enjoy from economies enlarged by mass migration.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want Poland to be just a piece of land. We don\u2019t want any other country to be just a piece of land, and a mark on the map,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPoland is much more than land itself. Poland is us. We are Poland, and we have to cherish it, we have to fight for it, we have to care about it, we have to think about the future.\u201d\n\nPoland Agrees New State Pension For Mothers Who Dedicated Lives to Bringing up Families https://t.co/NE25fcTUZH \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 1, 2019\n\n\u201cWe are not hedonists who are thinking only about today: \u2018I\u2019m going to amuse myself, I\u2019m going to eat something, drink, I\u2019m going to sleep, and that\u2019s what my existence, my life, is about\u2019 \u2014 no,\u201d Tarczy\u0144ski insisted.\n\n\u201cNational life and existence is about the past, about those who fought for our country \u2014 and it\u2019s about the future; about our children, our grandchildren, our identity, our music,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just let it go to please the leftists and others. So this election is about Poland, about our responsibility to cherish it and to preserve it for the next generation.\u201d\n\nPoland Signs into Law Anti-Sunday Shopping Legislation, Aims to Give Families More Time Together\n\nhttps://t.co/ZNRpB9XWDd \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 30, 2018\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "Poland's conservative govt has rejected dogma that \"the economy, stupid\" must be centre stage in any election campaign and put identity first", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/dominik-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
