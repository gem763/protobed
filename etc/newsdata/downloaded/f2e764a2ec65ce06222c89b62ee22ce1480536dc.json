BofAML upgraded its rating for Nike (NKE) from Underperform to Neutral and raised its price objective to $98 per share.\n\nBofAML also makes the case that the company could be categorized and valued not as a sportswear company but as a consumer staple due to its growth and reach. \"NKE's broadening customer base arguably supports a global consumer staples valuation (instead of a branded apparel & footwear company valuation), in our view,\" the note said.\n\nWhile the global slowdown in performance wear sales is a concern for the apparel industry, BofAML expects that Nike\u2019s non-performance \u201csportswear\u201d growth to offset any industry-wide malaise.\n\nAccording to BofAML, the decline in Nike\u2019s F20 consensus estimates (down 25%+ from a peak of $3.95 in June 2016) is over. The bank says that this is marked by the F1Q20 EPS upside led by Nike\u2019s non-technical \u201csportswear\u201d businesses.\n\nBofAML cites accelerated democratization of both and Nike and subsidiary Jordan brand with helping the company offset the overall stagnation that has hampered the performance category overall. \u201cIn performance product, we saw very strong momentum in Basketball internationally this quarter,\u201d said Nike President & CEO Mark G. Parker during the company\u2019s Q1 earnings call.\n\nA Nike store selling NBA Los Angeles Lakers sportswear is seen in Beijing, China October 10, 2019. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang More\n\nMuch of the Jordan brand\u2019s expansion efforts have focused on Greater China. Nike has maintained double-digit growth in China every quarter for more than 5 years. In Q1, the Oregon\u2013headquartered company saw a 27% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis in the region.\n\nIn fiscal \u201919, Jordan pulled in over $3 billion in revenue, which represents a record for the brand. Its follow up to that in Q1 was double-digit growth in all geographies.\n\n\n\nBofAML also noted strides the swoosh brand has made in the areas of women\u2019s & kids\u2019 apparel. This includes the company\u2019s continued evolution of its plus-size clothing and sports bra lines.\n\nReggie Wade is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
