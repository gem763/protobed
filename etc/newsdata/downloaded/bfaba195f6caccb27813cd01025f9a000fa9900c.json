REUTERS/Paul Hanna\n\n\u201cThe public could be put at risk if they interpret this new recommendation to mean we can continue eating as much red and processed meat as they like without increasing their risk of cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cGRAVE CONCERNS\u201d\n\nIn the analysis published on Monday, researchers from Canada, Spain and Poland conducted a series of reviews of both randomized controlled trials and observational studies looking at the possible health impact of eating red and processed meat.\n\nAmong the randomized trials they selected for analysis, which included around 54,000 people, they found no statistically significant link between eating meat and the risk of heart disease, diabetes, or cancer.\n\nAmong the observational studies, which covered millions of people, they did find \u201ca very small reduction in risk\u201d in those who ate three fewer servings of red or processed meat a week, but said this association \u201cwas very uncertain.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur bottom line recommendation ... is that for the majority of people, but not everyone, continuing their red and processed meat consumption is the best approach,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nDavid Katz, director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center at the Yale University School of Medicine, said he had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the potential of the new review \u201cfor damage to public understanding, and public health\u201d.\n\nBut other experts said the work was a comprehensive, well-conducted analysis of the available evidence on eating meat and human health.\n\n\u201cThis study will, I hope, help to eliminate the incorrect impression ... that some meat products are as carcinogenic as cigarette smoke, and to discourage dramatic media headlines claiming that \u2018bacon is killing us\u2019,\u201d said Ian Johnson, a nutrition expert at Britain\u2019s Quadram Institute of bioscience.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nChristine Laine, editor in chief of Annals of Internal Medicine, noted that nutrition studies are challenging.\n\n\u201cTo be honest with our patients and the public, we shouldn\u2019t be making recommendations that sound like they\u2019re based on solid evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cThere may be lots of reasons to decrease meat in your diet, but if you\u2019re decreasing it to improve your health, we don\u2019t have a lot of strong evidence to support that.\u201d", "description": "Cutting back on red and processed meat brings few if any health benefits, according to a review of evidence drawn from millions of people, but the finding contradicts dietary advice of international agencies and has prompted criticism from many experts.", "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435701673&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T1K1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
