WeWork was forced to delay its initial public offering in September after the company\u2019s prospectus raised questions about its worth and the leadership of co-founder and then-CEO Adam Neumann.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWeWork is now valued around $7 billion, a more than 85 percent drop from its peak.\n\n\u201cIt is not unusual for the world\u2019s leading technology disruptors to experience growth challenges as the one WeWork just faced,\u201d Masayoshi Son, chairman and chief executive of Softbank, said in a news release. \u201cSince the vision remains unchanged, SoftBank has decided to double down on the company by providing a significant capital infusion and operational support.\"\n\nSoftbank has now invested more than $13 billion in the cash-burning start-up, a move that has rattled investors. Its shares slumped 2.5 percent after the bailout package was announced, and are down nearly 30 percent from their July peak.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis sorry episode is also a searing indictment of Softbank\u2019s valuation and screening methodology which needs to shift towards being based on fundamentals rather than blue sky,\u201d Richard Windsor, founder of Radio Free Mobile, wrote in a research note Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nNeumann was ousted as chief executive last month amid allegations of self-dealing and reports of erratic and eccentric behavior that put the company at risk. Now, Neumann will leave the company he helped found in 2010 almost entirely, his exit sweetened by $1.7 billion in cash and credit from Softbank. Neumann will give up his voting rights while maintaining an unspecified stake.\n\nSoftbank\u2019s chief operating officer, Marcelo Claure, was appointed executive chairman of WeWork\u2019s board of directors. The board will be expanded, the company said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nJ.P. Morgan, one of WeWork\u2019s biggest external shareholders, had been competing with Softbank for WeWork\u2019s financial rescue. The company met with more than 100 investors to cobble together $5 billion in bailout funding, but refused to match Softbank\u2019s offer for Neumann, according to reporting from CNBC.\n\nAD\n\nWeWork, which essentially is a real estate company that positions itself as a tech start-up, saw rapid success with its hip co-working spaces. Since 2010, it\u2019s expanded to more than 30 countries and is one of the biggest private tenants in Manhattan, London and Washington, D.C. It claims about a third of the flexible office space market, according to data from real estate firm CBRE. Yet despite its aggressive expansion, the company has never turned a profit.\n\n\u201cThis financing provides WeWork with the capital to fully realize its objective of being the partner of choice to our members and landlords, while at the same time providing a platform for growth and capital returns for shareholders and employees,\u201d Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, co-chief executives of WeWork said in a news release. \u201cWe will have the flexibility to continue streamlining our assets and stabilizing the business without sacrificing our global brand and exceptional products.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWeWork is planning to lay off thousands of employees, but had to delay because it couldn\u2019t afford the severance costs, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAD\n\nWeWork\u2019s spectacular fall stands out even in a year defined by high-profile IPO flops from some of the most hyped names in tech. Ride-hailing giants Uber and Lyft, and exercise bike company Peloton, have all seen their share prices fall more than 20 percent since going public this year. Though all have been praised for their innovation and growth potential, they continue to blow through money without a clear-cut path to profitability.\n\n\u201cHopefully, this marks the beginning of the end of using IPOs on hyped-up loss-making unicorns as a profit-taking opportunity before the music stops,\u201d Jeffrey Halley, a senior analyst with OANDA, wrote in a recent note to investors.\n\nAD", "description": "The agreement gives the Japanese conglomerate an 80 percent stake in WeWork, which would have run out of money in November without the infusion.", "authors": ["Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XYeI18ySUmhJhsYxDZqc9c8VPwY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BX5K5BXU4II6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
