But the most likely option appeared to be a plan to take control of the order paper for SO24 emergency debates or more humble addresses in order to force the government to publish more documents, such as more Yellowhammer no-deal planning papers and the government\u2019s legal advice on prorogation. These have the potential to embarrass Johnson ahead of an election.\n\nCorbyn committed to whipping Labour MPs to vote for a general election as soon as a Brexit extension was secured. \u201cOnce we have agreed on the extension and carrying out the law of this country, at that point, and I made that very clear in my conference speech, we will support a general election,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernment ministers have been instructed to go to Manchester for the party\u2019s conference as usual, despite parliament having voted to continue sitting. The event, due to start on Sunday and continue until Wednesday, comes the weekend after Labour\u2019s party conference in Brighton and two weeks after the Liberal Democrats held theirs in Bournemouth.\n\nA government business motion for parliament to be adjourned at the end of the day on Thursday and resumed next Thursday was rejected by 306 to 289, a majority of 17. The prime minister said he was disappointed by the decision.\n\n\u201cFor many years it has been the case that parliament has been in recess so that parties can hold their party conference,\u201d Johnson\u2019s spokesman said. \u201cAs the prime minister has made clear the Conservative party conference will go ahead as planned.\u201d\n\nThe SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry said that \u201cparliamentary democracy and scrutiny during the current constitutional crisis\u201d should take precedence over the governing party\u2019s conference. She echoed comments made by Corbyn on Wednesday, who said the prime minister must not be able to \u201crun away from accountability yet again\u201d.\n\nA senior government source said there were no plans to change the date of the Johnson\u2019s conference speech, which is scheduled for Wednesday, when prime minister\u2019s questions are usually held. Another member of the government could therefore stand in for the prime minister in parliament.\n\n\n\nSeven of the 21 Tories who had the whip withdrawn over Brexit this month voted with the opposition to stop parliament being adjourned for the conference. Among them were the former cabinet ministers Ken Clarke, David Gauke, Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve. Amber Rudd, who resigned from her position as work and pensions secretary in solidarity with the 21, also voted against.\n\nAfter 10 years, the supreme court is confident in its role Read more\n\nThe meeting of opposition parties on Thursday took place the day after parliament was hastily reconvened following a decision by the supreme court that the advice the prime minister gave to the Queen on the prorogation of parliament was unlawful.\n\nSpeaking following the meeting, Corbyn expressed concern that Johnson had not given an explicit undertaking that he would abide by the so-called Benn Act, which is designed to force the prime minister to ask for an extension of article 50 if parliament does not pass a deal with the EU by 19 October.\n\nHe said the law was \u201cnot a matter of choice\u201d for Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s an act of parliament that was passed,\u201d said Corbyn. \u201cWe will be taking parliamentary action on this again next week to ensure that the prime minister does not crash us out of the EU on 31 October without a deal.\u201d\n\nLiz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader in the Commons, said Boris Johnson could not be allowed to \u201csimply brush off breaking the law\u201d. \u201cPlaid Cymru will work with other opposition parties to hold him to account and are actively considering means in parliament that would see the prime minister censured,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Green party MP Caroline Lucas tweeted an image of herself with other opposition politicians. \u201cAway from the bombast and bullying of the prime minister, the real work goes on. MPs from across the house continue to meet to stop his disastrous crash-out Brexit,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is what our politics should look like.\u201d\n\nA Plaid Cymru source said opposition MPs were getting on better than expected. \u201cIt surprises all of us how easy these meetings are,\u201d they said.", "description": "Cross-party group of MPs meet at office of Jeremy Corbyn to plan efforts to stop no deal", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Frances Perraudin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be8dbc60cbdd8e9dab349a09edb78c83b3fab194/17_0_1687_1012/master/1687.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ba40dd2bdaabe93d6d7dd5e46687e20a", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
