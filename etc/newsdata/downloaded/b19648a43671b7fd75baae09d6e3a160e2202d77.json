Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane\n\nIncidentally, the rumpus over investigations into Bosasa and the so-called SA Revenue Service rogue unit, among others, comes at a time when Mkhwebane is conducting provincial workshops about the executive code of ethics.\n\n\u201cThe code expects you to act like saints,\u201d she told the premiers of Limpopo, the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nIndeed, the code holds elected officials to angelic standards.\n\nFor instance, it has provisions that prohibit Cabinet members at national and provincial level from undertaking any other paid work, exposing themselves to any situation involving the risk of a conflict between their official responsibilities and their private interests, or using their positions or any information entrusted to them to enrich themselves or improperly benefit any other person, among other things.\n\nBut what many, including critics in political circles, civil society and the media, tend to miss is that the EMEA imposes certain non-negotiables on the Public Protector, including that: . Out of the entire arsenal of governance and oversight institutions in the public sector, only the Public Protector must receive complaints about breaches of the code of ethics, which is a creature of the EMEA.\n\n. Only parliamentarians or legislators can lodge complaints of alleged breaches of the code and, on receipt of the complaints, the Public Protector must investigate and conclude such probe within a month.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, a regular member of the public would no doubt see a Public Protector who has entered the political arena doing the bidding of the opposition and rushing to conclude an investigation at the expense of complaints lodged by ordinary people.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, self-serving politicians, who know better, opportunistically fan the flames of these misconceptions.\n\nAfter this comes the name-calling, the insults and threats of impeachment.\n\nThe pertinent question is: How should members of the executive \u2013 who have a constitutional duty to assist and protect the Public Protector to ensure its independence, impartiality, dignity and effectiveness \u2013 deal with the institution\u2019s findings?\n\nPerhaps we must look to former president Nelson Mandela for moral guidance.\n\nDespite his occupation of high office, he submitted himself to accountability processes when he took the witness stand in the Pretoria High Court on the matter brought by the SA Rugby Football Union.\n\n\u201cEven when his own supporters saw his appearance in court as humiliation, president Mandela was not offended. Instead he saw his attendance of the proceedings as a sign of respect for the administration of justice,\u201d Mkhwebane said.\n\nIt is going to be important for the public to read Mkhwebane\u2019s reports, the EMEA and the code for themselves, rather than relying on propaganda from the likes of Leon and Zille.\n\nThey will then realise that the Public Protector merely played the hand she was given.\n\nShe did not go around canvassing opposition politicians for the complaints that led to the findings she is being lambasted for, but was approached in terms of the law and entertained the complaints as the law requires.\n\nDuring the investigations, she came across overwhelming evidence of wrongdoing, tested it and proceeded to make findings before taking what she deemed appropriate remedial action.\n\nAny other rational Public Protector faced with the same facts, evidence and circumstances would have undoubtedly arrived at the same conclusions.\n\nSegalwe is spokesperson of the Public Protector\n\n", "description": "Last month, former DA leader Tony Leon berated current party leader Mmusi Maimane for having asked Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to investigate President Cyril Ramaphosa over the Bosasa donation to the CR17 campaign and related matters.", "authors": ["Oupa Segalwe"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9412/5146a978e2fd4179934978372c946e63.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
