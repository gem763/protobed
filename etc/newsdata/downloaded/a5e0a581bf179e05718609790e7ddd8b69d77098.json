It was the seventh straight quarter in which AT&T lost more TV customers than it did in the quarter before.\n\nProfits and revenues for the telecommunications giant\u2019s video unit were also down from the same period last year. AT&T is far from the only company to be hit hard by cable subscribers cutting the cord, but as the biggest television provider in the US, its stake in traditional TV is bigger than most.\n\nSo AT&T has to figure out a way to retain its existing TV customer base (about 20.5 million subscribers between DirecTV, which the company bought in 2015, and its U-verse brand) before there aren\u2019t any of them left.\n\nOne way to do that, AT&T thinks, is to convert those people to streaming.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t buy DirecTV because we love satellite,\u201d AT&T COO John Stankey told Reuters last week. \u201cWe bought DirecTV because we love the customer base and the customer base could be migrated into more on-demand-oriented products and services.\u201d\n\nTaking Stankey at his word, AT&T bought DirecTV four years ago knowing that it\u2019d eventually buy a content company like WarnerMedia to help lure pay-TV customers into new services\u2014like, say, a streaming platform. AT&T will launch HBO Max, its Netflix competitor, early next year.\n\nThe owner of HBO and the Warner Bros. movie studio, WarnerMedia is one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world. It provides more than enough content to sustain a streaming service (which is likely to be reflected in HBO Max\u2019s price, rumored to be slightly higher than the $15 per month that it costs to subscribe to standalone HBO).\n\nAT&T and other TV providers first tried to stave off the bleeding by launching internet-based \u201cover-the-top\u201d services aimed at Americans who had either already cut the cord or never paid for TV in the first place. These were lighter, sometimes cheaper versions of traditional TV bundles, except delivered online rather than via cables or satellites.\n\nResults on these services have been mixed (none of the major ones, including Hulu Live, Sling TV, and Playstation Vue, have more than 3 million subscribers). And now AT&T\u2019s version, AT&T Now, is bleeding subscribers too. It lost 195,000 customers this quarter\u2014the fourth quarter of losses in a row. AT&T Now has only 1.1 million subscribers in total three years after launch.\n\nThis suggests that the unwieldiness of cable and satellite TV subscriptions wasn\u2019t the only thing that caused customers to cut the cord. Younger consumers may simply be uninterested in the TV channel experience of old, even if it\u2019s delivered over the internet.\n\nAT&T is forecasting 50 million subscribers to HBO Max in the US by 2025. If it does hit that mark, it\u2019d make the ongoing collapse of the company\u2019s pay-TV empire a bit more palatable.\n\nSign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world\u2019s most important and interesting news.\n\nMore stories from Quartz:", "description": "AT&T; has to figure out a way to retain its existing base of TV customers before there aren't any of them left.", "authors": ["Adam Epstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fUQY2NuCcvjRbFhaBgYvhA--~B/aD0zNDk7dz02MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/quartz.com/c83edd35700a24f1f39ce8d92c7a6865", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
