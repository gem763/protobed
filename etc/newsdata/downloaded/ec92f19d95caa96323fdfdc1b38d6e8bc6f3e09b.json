It also, somehow, is going to be the first time you can play as the U.S.A., at least in this particular Battlefield.\n\nThe Pacific is the focus of Battlefield V\u2019s Chapter 5, and when it releases (for free) on October 31 it\u2019ll have two maps: Iwo Jima, which combines beach landings with king of the hill battles over Mount Suribachi and Pacific Storm, which looks like a modern reinterpretation of the Paracel Storm map from Battlefield 4.\n\nYou can play as either the Imperial Japanese Army or the \u201cU.S. Armed Forces\u201d, an amalgamation of the Army and Navy, and because it\u2019s the Pacific there are new tanks, weapons, aircraft and gun emplacements unique to the theatre.\n\nHere\u2019s the trailer, which covers pretty much all of that, only with lots of explosions. Lots of explosions:\n\nI wonder what it would have been like had the game launched with this trailer instead.", "description": "Next week, Battlefield V is heading to the Pacific with two new maps, two new factions and loads of new vehicles and weapons.
