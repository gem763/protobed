(F150Terp via Flickr)\n\nWhile very warm (mid- to upper 80s) and pretty humid, at least today gave us a beautiful sky. The unseasonable warmth and humidity will last through this evening, but a shift in wind direction should bring in cooler air and cloudier skies on Monday.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: Clouds increase as this evening progresses, thanks to a wind shift from off the Atlantic (easterly at 5 to 10 mph), and while temperatures fall through the 70s, they won\u2019t drop much lower because of the overcast conditions. Overnight lows generally settle in the mid-60s as humidity levels stay at somewhat uncomfortable levels (dew points in the low 60s).\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Monday): The last day of September will be rather uneventful, as we\u2019ll have mostly cloudy skies with the slightest chance of a shower in the afternoon (our far-western areas are most likely to see a shower, although the chance is still quite low). Onshore, southeasterly winds will be light but will support cooler highs in the mid-70s. Humidity will remain much the same.\n\nSee Brian Jackson\u2019s forecast through the weekend.

The European model guidance remains more bullish on projecting the hotter highs (94-96), while the American model is more modest (90-92). We\u2019ll have to see whether a consensus emerges as Wednesday draws closer.\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
