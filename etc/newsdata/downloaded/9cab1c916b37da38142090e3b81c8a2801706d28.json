But nobody raised this key issue.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates debate in Houston on Thursday. (David J. Phillip/AP)\n\nFinally, after three debates among Democratic presidential candidates with scarcely a question about education, a moderator, Linsey Davis of ABC News, raised the issue Thursday night. She asked some good questions \u2014 even if some candidates tried to skirt them or stated as fact things that may not, in fact, be true.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a particularly revelatory discussion, with candidates generally sticking to their talking points. But it did touch on some key subjects, including school segregation, charter schools, teacher pay, student debt and universal pre-K.\n\nSome important issues were briefly raised, such as when Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing and urban development secretary in the Obama administration, said that improving schools cannot be divorced from housing, health care and social policy: \u201cOur schools are segregated because our neighborhoods are segregated.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raised another key issue when he noted that the United States has one of the world\u2019s highest child poverty rates, which is a factor in academic achievement.\n\nBut the one thing that nobody discussed onstage is what many public education activists see as the root of public education\u2019s problems: the funding system, which relies heavily, though not exclusively, on property taxes. The obvious result is that poorer neighborhoods have fewer funds and more cash-strapped schools. Federal money intended to help close the gap hasn\u2019t come close.\n\nAccording to the Learning Policy Institute, a California nonprofit think tank founded by Linda Darling-Hammond, a highly respected educator and researcher who is chairwoman of the California Board of Education: \u201cThe highest-spending districts in the United States spend nearly 10 times more than the lowest-spending, with large differentials both across and within states.\u201d In most states, it says, children who live in low-income neighborhoods attend the schools most deprived of resources.\n\nIt said in this 2019 report:\n\nOn average, school districts serving the largest concentrations of students of color receive approximately $1,800 less per student in state and local funding than those serving the fewest students of color, and the differentials are even greater within states. For example, in Illinois, per-pupil funding ranged from $8,500 to $32,000 in 2016, with suburban districts in Cook County outspending nearby Chicago by more than $10,000 per pupil. The great divide in funding comes largely from reliance on local property taxes. Districts with higher property values bring in more property tax revenues and provide correspondingly higher funding for schools than poorer districts do. States typically offset these disparities to some extent, but rarely provide an equitable system that can respond to student needs. Funding disparities are so acute and widespread that lawsuits have been filed in more than 40 states in an attempt to remedy inequities.\n\nDavis approached the subject, but never fully got there, with this question to Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.):\n\nIt was 65 years ago this year that the Supreme Court outlawed racial segregation in public schools. Yet for millions of students of color today, segregation remains a reality. Nonwhite districts typically receive $2,200 less per student than those in white districts. This means older books, less access to computers and often worse outcomes. What is your plan to address segregation? And I\u2019m not just talking about the achievement gap, but I\u2019m talking about the opportunity gap in education.\n\nBooker talked about his controversial effort to overhaul schools when he was mayor of Newark, which focused on school choice and the use of student test scores to evaluate teachers. He didn\u2019t mention that it faced fierce opposition from many Newark residents or that one of his triumphs was just eliminated.\n\nBooker said, as he often does, that he raised teachers\u2019 wages but didn\u2019t mention that the 2012 contract with the teachers union linked raises and bonuses to test scores, which assessment experts say is not reliable or valid in high-stakes situations. He also didn\u2019t mention that the school district and the union agreed last month on a contract eliminating that linkage.\n\nSo what other education subjects did the candidates discuss?\n\nDavis began the education discussion with a question to entrepreneur Andrew Yang that goes to the heart of one of the most important debates in education today: school choice, specifically charter schools. They are publicly financed but privately operated, sometimes by for-profit companies. About 6 percent of America\u2019s schoolchildren attend a charter.\n\nCharters used to enjoy significant bipartisan support. But more recently, Democrats have backed away as opponents have accused the charter movement of seeking to privatize public education and taking money away from cash-strapped districts. So Davis asked Yang, a supporter of charter schools, this question:\n\nYou\u2019re the most vocal proponent on this stage for charter schools. You have said that Democrats who want to limit them are, quote, \u201cjust jumping into bed with teachers unions and doing kids a disservice.\u201d Why isn\u2019t taxpayer money better spent on fixing traditional public schools?\n\nYang was not eager to wrap himself in the charter banner Thursday night, pivoting by saying, \u201cLet me be clear. I am pro-good school. I\u2019ve got a kid. One of my little boys just started public school last week and I was not there because I was running for president.\u201d\n\nHe continued, never mentioning charters, but did say that \u201cthe data clearly shows that 65 to 70 percent of our students\u2019 outcomes are determined outside of the school.\u201d There is data that shows that, but some data shows different percentages. His overall point that out-of-school factors contribute more to student achievement than in-school factors is sound, but data points can be slippery things.\n\nOther examples included:\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) talked about the importance of teachers and her plan to raise their pay with federal funds: \u201cIf a black child has a black teacher before the end of third grade, they\u2019re 13 percent more likely to go to college. If that child has had two black teachers before the end of third grade, they\u2019re 32 percent more likely to go to college.\u201d\n\nResearch does show a positive long-term impact on black students who have had black teachers, and there is a 2018 study by Johns Hopkins University and American University researchers that advances the data points Harris cited. There are, though, other studies that show the same effect but with different data points.\n\nWhile answering a question about what responsibility he thinks \u201cAmericans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country,\u201d former vice president Joe Biden said: \u201cA kid coming from a very poor school, a very poor background, will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.\u201d\n\nThere is no definitive evidence about how many words students from low-income families hear when they are young compared to more privileged students. The \u201cword gap\u201d notion comes from a 1992 book that had details of a study done with a total of 42 families that concluded kids from poor families hear 30 million fewer words by age 3 than more privileged students. That was debunked with another study, as NPR reported, in 2017, that said the word gap was more like 4 million. The results of that study have also been questioned.\n\nBiden came closer when saying there is one school psychologist for every 1,500 students; there were an estimated 1,381 students to 1 psychologist in the 2014-2015 school year, data from National Association of School Psychologists shows.\n\nHere\u2019s the transcript of the education discussion during the debate:\n\nDavis: I\u2019d like to have an academic discussion now about education.\n\nMr. Yang, we\u2019ll stay with you. Here in Houston, the school district is facing yet another year of spending cuts. Like schools across the country, the system faces many challenges. One of them: Thousands of students are leaving traditional public schools and going to charter schools.\n\nYou\u2019re the most vocal proponent on this stage for charter schools. You have said that Democrats who want to limit them are, quote, \u201cjust jumping into bed with teachers unions and doing kids a disservice.\u201d Why isn\u2019t taxpayer money better spent on fixing traditional public schools?\n\nYang: Let me be clear, I am pro-good school. I\u2019ve got a kid. One of my little boys just started public school last week and I was not there because I was running for president.\n\n(Laughter)\n\nSo, we need to pay teachers more because the data clearly shows that a good teacher is worth his or her weight in gold.\n\n(Applause)\n\nWe need to lighten up the emphasis on standardized tests, which do not measure anything fundamental about our character or human worth.\n\n(Applause)\n\nBut here\u2019s the big one. The data clearly shows that 65 to 70 percent of our students\u2019 outcomes are determined outside of the school. We\u2019re talking about time spent at home with the parents, words read to them when they\u2019re young, stress levels in the house, income, type of neighborhood.\n\nWe\u2019re putting money into schools, and educators know this: We\u2019re saying you\u2019re 100 percent responsible for educating your kids, but you can only control 30 percent. They all know this. The answer is to put money directly into the families and neighborhoods to give our kids a chance to learn and our teachers a chance to teach.\n\n(Applause)\n\nDavis: Mayor Buttigieg, 45 seconds to respond.\n\nPete Buttigieg (mayor of South Bend, Ind.): Step one is appoint a secretary of education who actually believes in public education.\n\n(Applause)\n\nI believe in public education. And to strengthen it, some things are very complex, for preparing for a future where knowledge is at your fingertips, but we have got to teach more to do with critical thinking and social and emotional learning. Some of it is extremely simple. We have just got to pay teachers more. And we have got to lift up the teaching profession.\n\nI always think of a story from South Bend of friends who hosted exchange students from Japan. They had a student one year who wanted to be a teacher. And they kept in touch with her when she went back to Japan and to college. She took the exam to try to become a teacher in a society that really regards teachers and compensates teachers well. And she came up just short.\n\nSo, you know what she did? Since she was academically good but couldn\u2019t quite make the cut to be a teacher, she had a fallback plan. She became a doctor. That is how seriously some countries treat the teaching profession. If we want to get the results that we expect for our children, we have to support and compensate the teaching profession. Respect teachers the way we do soldiers and pay them more like the way we do doctors.\n\n(Applause)\n\nDavis: Sen. Warren, to use Mr. Yang\u2019s term, are you just jumping into bed with teachers unions?\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.): You know, I think I\u2019m the only person on this stage who has been a public school teacher.\n\n(Applause)\n\nI had wanted to be a public school teacher since I was in second grade. And let's be clear in all the ways we talk about this, money for public schools should stay in public schools, not go anywhere else.\n\n(Applause)\n\nI've already made my commitment. I will \u2014 we will have a secretary of education who has been a public school teacher.\n\n(Applause)\n\nI think this is ultimately about our values. I have proposed a two-cent wealth tax on the top one-tenth of 1 percent in this country. That would give us enough money to start with our babies by providing universal child care for every baby age zero to 5, universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in this country.\n\nDavis: Thank you, senator.\n\nWarren: Raise the wages of every child-care worker and preschool teacher in this country, cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the folks who\u2019ve got it.\n\n(Applause)\n\nDAVIS: Thank you, senator.\n\nWarren: And strengthen our unions. This is how we build an America that reflects our values, not just where the money comes from with the billionaires and corporate executives.\n\nDavis: Senator Harris, 45 seconds to respond.\n\nHarris: My first-grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson, God rest her soul, attended my law school graduation. I think most of us would say that we are not where we are without the teachers who believed in us.\n\nI have offered in this campaign a proposal to deal with this, which will be the first in the nation, federal investment, in closing the teacher pay gap, which is $13,500 a year. Because right now, in our public schools, our teachers, 94 percent of them are coming out of their own pocket to help pay for school supplies. And that is wrong.\n\nI also want to talk about where we are here at TSU [Texas Southern University], and what it means in terms of HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities]. I have as part of my proposal that we will put $2 trillion into investing in our HBCUs for teachers, because \u2014\n\n(Applause)\n\nBecause, because, one, as a proud graduate of a historically black college and university, I will say \u2014 I will say that it is our HBCUs that disproportionately produce teachers and those who serve in these many professions, but also \u2014\n\nDavis: Thank you, senator.\n\nHarris: But this is a critical point, if a black child has a black teacher before the end of third grade, they\u2019re 13 percent more likely to go to college.\n\n(Applause)\n\nIf that child has had two black teachers before the end of third grade, they\u2019re 32 percent more likely to go to college. So, when we talk about investing in our public education system, it is at the source of so much. When we fix it, that will fix so many other things. We must invest in the potential of our children.\n\nDavis: Thank you, senator. Senator Sanders, 45 seconds.\n\nHarris: And I strongly believe you can judge a society based on how it treats its children, and we are failing on this issue.\n\nDavis: Thank you, senator.\n\n(Applause)\n\nSanders: Guess what?\n\n(Laughter)\n\nYou\u2019re guessing, all right, here\u2019s the answer: We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. And yet, we have the highest child poverty rate of almost any country on Earth. We have teachers in this country who are leaving education because they can\u2019t work two or three jobs to support themselves, which is why, under my legislation, we\u2019ll move to see that every teacher in America [makes] at least $60,000 a year.\n\n(Applause)\n\nWhat we will also do is not only have universal pre-K, we will make public colleges and universities and HBCUs debt-free. And what we will always also do, because this is an incredible burden on millions and millions of young people who did nothing wrong except try to get the education they need, we are going to cancel all student debt in this country.\n\n(Applause)\n\nDavis: Thank you, senator. Thank you, senator.\n\nSanders: And we are going to do that by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.\n\n(Applause)\n\nDavis: Thank you, senator.\n\nMr. Vice President, I want to come to you and talk to you about inequality in schools and race. In a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975, you told a reporter, \u201cI don\u2019t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather, I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I\u2019ll be d----- if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.\"\n\nYou said that some 40 years ago. But as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?\n\nBiden: Well, they have to deal with the \u2014 look, there\u2019s institutional segregation in this country. And from the time I got involved, I started dealing with that. Redlining banks, making sure that we are in a position where \u2014 look, you talk about education. I propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title I schools, triple the amount of money we spend from $15 [billion] to $45 billion a year. Give every single teacher a raise, the equal raise to getting out the $60,000 level.\n\nNumber two, make sure that we bring in to help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home, we need \u2014 we have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today. It\u2019s crazy.\n\nThe teachers are \u2014 I\u2019m married to a teacher. My deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. We have \u2014 make sure that every single child does, in fact, have 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds go to school. School. Not day care. School. We bring social workers in to homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children.\n\nIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help. They don\u2019t \u2014 they don\u2019t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the \u2014 the \u2014 make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school \u2014 a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.\n\nDavis: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\n\nBiden: There\u2019s so much we \u2014 no, I\u2019m going to go like the rest of them do, twice over, okay?\n\n(Applause)\n\nBecause here\u2019s the deal. The deal is that we\u2019ve got this a little backward. And by the way, in Venezuela, we should be allowing people to come here from Venezuela. I know Maduro. I\u2019ve confronted Maduro.\n\nNumber two, you talk about the need to do something in Latin America. I\u2019m the guy that came up with $740 million to see to it those three countries, in fact, changed their system so people don\u2019t have to chance to leave. You\u2019re all acting like we just discovered this yesterday. Thank you very much.\n\nDavis: Thank you very much.\n\nSecretary Castro?\n\nCastro: Thank you very much. Well, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s quite a lot.\n\nBiden: (Off-mike)\n\n(Laughter)\n\nCastro: But, you know \u2014 I grew up in one of those neighborhoods that folks have talked about and a neighborhood that was grappling with the legacy of segregation. In fact, in two public school districts that were involved in a 1973 Supreme Court case challenging how Texas financed its schools.\n\nAnd I know that today our schools are segregated because our neighborhoods are segregated. Now, I have an education plan, like a lot of folks up here, that would pay teachers more, that would recruit diverse ranks of teachers, that would invest in our public schools, but I also believe that we have to connect the dots to uplift the quality of life to invest in housing opportunity, to invest in job opportunity, to invest in community schools that offer resources like parents able to go back and get their GED, and health-care opportunities, and those things that truly ensure that the entire family can prosper.\n\nThose are the types of things that we need to do, in addition to lifting up our public schools. You asked a second ago about charter schools. Look, it is a myth that charter schools are better than public schools. They're not.\n\n(Applause)\n\nDavis: Thank you, secretary.\n\nCastro: And so while I\u2019m not categorically against charter schools, I would require more transparency and accountability from them than is required right now.\n\nDavis: Senator Booker, coming to you now. It was 65 years ago this year that the Supreme Court outlawed racial segregation in public schools. Yet for millions of students of color today, segregation remains a reality.\n\nNonwhite districts typically receive $2,200 less per student than those in white districts. This means older books, less access to computers and often worse outcomes. What is your plan to address segregation? And I\u2019m not just talking about the achievement gap, but I\u2019m talking about the opportunity gap in education.\n\nBooker: So, I\u2019m hearing a lot of conversations on the stage that \u2014 and the way we talk about communities of color. Look, I live in a black and brown community below the poverty line. I\u2019ve lived in public housing projects almost for a decade and saw the anguish of parents who are just so deeply frustrated that they don\u2019t have a school that serves their genius.\n\nI think I'm the only person on the stage \u2014 even though I had no formal authority as mayor to run a school system \u2014 I stepped up and took responsibility for our schools, and we produced results. A lot of folks here are talking about raising teacher salary. We actually did it in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nAnd we didn\u2019t stop there. Yeah, we closed poor-performing charter schools, but, dagnabbit, we expanded high-performing charter schools. We were a city that said we need to find local solutions that work for our community. The results speak for themselves. We\u2019re now the number one city in America for Beat the Odds schools, from high poverty to high performance.\n\nStrategies like investing in our children work. And I\u2019ll tell you this. I am tired of us thinking about these problems isolated, disconnected from other issues.\n\nThat\u2019s why my friend, Secretary Castro, is 100 percent right. We are in the reality we are right now because, Mr. Vice President, of overtly racist policies, not 400 years ago, just in my lifetime, that were redlining communities, disinfesting in communities, and more than just that, my kids are not only struggling with racial segregation and housing and the challenges of underfunded schools, but they\u2019re also struggling with environmental injustice.\n\nIf you\u2019ve talked to someone who\u2019s a parent of a child has had permanent brain damage because of lead, you\u2019ll know this is a national problem because there\u2019s over 3,000 jurisdictions in America where children have more than twice the blood lead levels of Flint, Michigan.\n\nDavis: Thank you, senator.\n\nBooker: And so, if I\u2019m president of the United States, it is a holistic solution to education, from raising teacher salary, fully funded special education, but combating the issues of poverty, combating the issues of racial segregation, combating the issues of a criminal justice system.\n\nDavis: Thank you, senator.\n\nBooker: That takes parents away from their kids, and dealing with environmental justice as a major pillar of any climate policy.", "description": "We did, though, get some education questions for the first time.", "authors": ["Valerie Strauss", "Reporter Covering Education", "Foreign Affairs", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5J5NofvkvZfmTOzTp14HZ0e2miw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F6ZUQAWWBQI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
