These solvents are used to deliver the nicotine or THC particles in an aerosol form so users can then inhale the substances.\n\nAccording to Voigt, when these ingredients are consumed often, they can coat the tongue so that flavourings that would normally hit the taste buds are blocked off. These chemicals can also inflame the nasal cavity, Voigt said, but \"we need sense of smell to have a complex enjoyment of taste, so if the nose is congested, it brings sense of taste down.\"\n\nWhen this happens, a person may not only stop responding to the flavour of their vape, but also the flavours of food and drink.\n\nThere's no research on the long-term risks of vape tongue\n\nAlthough vape tongue is a temporary side effect that resolves on its own, it's possible that it could compromise a person's oral health if they repeatedly develop vape tongue or have the condition for an extended period of time, Voigt said.\n\nAt the moment, no research on the long-term health effects of vape tongue exist.\n\nResearch has shown, however, that vaping can lead to other long-term oral health consequences like lung inflammation and gastrointestinal problems.\n\nA November 2016 study found that after just a few minutes of puffing on both tobacco- and menthol-flavoured vapes, oral tissue became inflamed, which can make someone more susceptible to oral diseases like gum disease or oral cancer.\n\nAnother study published in February found that vaping can change oral tissue on a molecular level, which could in turn increase cancer risk.\n\nFor these reasons, Voigt recommends vape users gradually wean off their devices and eventually swear off vapes entirely.\n\n\"My gut instinct is there will be long-term health consequences with continued use of vaping,\" Voigt said.", "description": "Some vape users are losing their sense of smell and taste because vape juices coat their tongues and block their taste buds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7951/29c0cd2ec52249bc9f6d4fc8369ca032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
