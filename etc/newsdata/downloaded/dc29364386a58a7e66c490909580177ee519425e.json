You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBest time to visit: Late October\n\nNorthern Portugal\u2019s Douro Valley is better known for its wine-making (while port usually grabs the headlines, it also produces some excellent red and white wines). In summer, the river, which snakes through Portugal\u2019s second city Porto, sparkles; but in autumn, the banks of the river turn into a canvas of red, brown and orange. And thankfully, the vineyards and wine cellars are open all year round...\n\nTuscany, Italy\n\nBest time to visit: End of September onwards\n\nTuscany\u2019s endless olive groves and cypress landscapes flex into a canvas of deep oranges and reds during the autumnal months. Just 50km from Tuscan showstopper Florence is the Casentinesi Forests National Park, one of the largest forests in Europe, which come autumn hosts a festival called \u201cAutunno Slow\u201d: events include hiking; photography workshops; and more epicurean activities including festivals dedicated to local produce such as chestnuts or cheese. The usually overpopulated Tuscan cities of Pisa, Florence and Siena are also quieter and more thoughtful at this time of year.\n\nUpstate New York, US\n\nBest time to visit: Mid-October\n\nMid-October is peak time for autumn colours in the Hudson Valley in Upstate New York. Just a couple of hours\u2019 drive (or train from Grand Central station) out of the city proper and the valley turns lush and the towns quaint (think farmers\u2019 markets and clapboard houses). Fall colours aren\u2019t hard to spot up here, but for some of the best foliage, head to the Walkway Over The Hudson State Historic Park in the town of Poughkeepsie, which is also the world\u2019s longest elevated pedestrian bridge. Tack on a couple of days in New York itself, which in September and October hits the sweet-spot between too humid and too cold.\n\nLoch Lomond and the Trossachs, UK\n\nBest time to visit: end of September onwards\n\nCome autumn, the lakes, waterfalls and trails of the gorgeous Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park in central Scotland are washed in a beautiful russet. If you\u2019re feeling active, take on a 12-mile section of the Rob Roy Way, one of Scotland\u2019s great trails, from the town of Killin to Ardtalnaig along the banks of Loch Tay. If not, admire the reflections of the trees in the glass-still Loch Chon; or visit the town of Aberfoyle for its annual mushroom festival, which takes place in October.\n\nProvence, France\n\nBest time to visit: November onwards\n\nAlthough Provence is more often associated with sipping chilled rose under the summer sun, its famous lavender fields swathing the landscape in purple, autumn is just as fine a time to see rural southern France. The fields and vineyards are transformed from green to amber, umber, rust and gold as the leaves change. Plus, it\u2019s the perfect time to try truffle hunting \u2013 the Vaucluse region is known for its black truffle, which is harvested from November to mid-March, and sold for a premium at the weekly market in Carpentras.\n\nWye Valley, UK\n\nBest time to visit: October\n\nIf it seems a bit much to go all the way to New England to try leaf peeping, how about just England? And Wales. The Wye Valley straddles both countries, and shows off the UK\u2019s autumn colours at their best. This Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty also features the magnificent Wye River, which winds its way through the dramatic landscape. The best way to see it is by walking \u2013 the 225km-long Wye Valley Walk is a gorgeous marked trail running all the way from Chepstow in Monmouthshire to Plynlimon, the highest point of the Cambrian Mountains in Wales.\n\nLake Louise, Canada\n\nBest time to visit: September to late October\n\nLake Louise is on many travellers\u2019 winter bucket list, thanks to its proximity to three world-class ski areas (Banff Sunshine, Lake Louise Ski Resort and Mt Norquay), all within Banff National Park. But get in there before the ski season starts and this picturesque hamlet known for its glacier-fed, bright blue lake, offers a whole different kind of beauty. The fiery orange of the changing leaves contrasts wonderfully with the turquoise of the water and the sharp white of surrounding snow-capped peaks.\n\nBlack Forest, Germany\n\nBest time to visit: Early October\n\nThe birthplace of all manner of fairytales, the Black Forest is Germany\u2019s largest nature reserve and offers 3,750 square miles densely covered in foliage. Although, true to its name, much of the area is made up of evergreens \u2013 not ideal for leaf peeping \u2013 places within the region such as the spa town of Baden Baden hold much more diversity, with trees that turn from pale yellow to rich orange. And the town itself cuts a dash, with grand colonnaded buildings surrounded by tree-covered hills. From 27 September to 6 October, Baden Baden hosts the Festspiel Baden-Baden Autumn Festival, a mixture of concerts, ballet, musicals and theatre.\n\nDaisetsuzan National Park, Japan\n\nBest time to visit: Late September\n\nMany places in Japan are known for their bombastic foliage colours when summer shifts to autumn \u2013 Tokyo and Kyoto for a start. Escape the crowds and head instead for northern island Hokkaido, where Daisetsuzan National Park, Japan\u2019s largest, starts its transformation early. From late September visitors can see the full spectrum, from mustard to vivid red, while trekking the park\u2019s many kilometres of hiking trails, ogling its numerous waterfalls or simply drinking in the gobsmacking views from its two cable cars. There are also \u201cwild\u201d hot springs for those wanting to get even closer to nature (and three official onsen resorts for those who like things more structured).", "description": "Autumn is a great time to travel \u2013 the heat might have disappeared, but so have the crowds.
