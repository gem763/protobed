THE LAST ONE IS SPOT ON #riseandshine \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd pic.twitter.com/h3ovFuoxwn \u2014 Lexi (@LexiNajera) October 19, 2019\n\nCelebs took notice, too.\n\nAriana Grande has expressed interest in sampling the phrase for an upcoming song and Lizzo performed her own version of the melody in concert over the weekend.\n\nEven Miley Cyrus is getting in on the action.\n\nSo with all of this attention, what\u2019s one of the world\u2019s youngest billionaires to do?\n\nStart printing \u201cRise and shine\u201d T-shirts, of course.\n\nTrademarking the phrase\n\nRegistering something as a trademark makes it illegal for others to use the trademark \u2014 be it a phrase, a brand name, or otherwise \u2014 without a licensing agreement from the trademark holder.\n\nJenner is attempting to trademark \u201cRise and shine\u201d for both cosmetics and apparel, including belts, bottoms, coats, dresses, footwear, headbands, headwear, swimwear, and more.\n\nAnd she\u2019s not the first viral sensation to do so.\n\nDrag queen and meme queen Jasmine Masters went viral earlier this summer with her \u201cAnd I Oop\u201d video.\n\n(Jasmine Masters/YouTube)\n\nOnce it went viral, Masters was quick to trademark \u201cAnd I Oop\u201d through the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to start stamping it on T-shirts and hoodies.\n\nBut \"Rise and shine\u201d and \u201cAnd I Oop\u201d are a lot different.\n\nSince \u201cRise and shine\u201d is already something people famously say in the morning, Jenner might have a harder time registering her trademark.\n\nThis is perhaps why she\u2019s also submitted \u201cRIIISE AND SHIIINNEE\u201d for trademark \u2014 as a back-up in case the shorter version is rejected.\n\nWhat gets the pass?\n\nAlthough there are many reasons that the USPTO might reject a trademark, one of the biggest is \u201clikelihood of confusion.\"\n\nThis is the likelihood of a trademark being confused with one that already exists. So if there\u2019s already a \u201cRise and shine\u201d clothing company, Jenner might be out of luck.\n\nHow the trademark is used also matters.\n\nSo if a breakfast restaurant has trademarked \u201cRise and Shine\u201d as their name, it won\u2019t affect Jenner\u2019s application.\n\nOther factors, such as if the trademark will actually be recognized as a trademark, also matter.\n\nBut will Jenner\u2019s phrase be given special priority because of its cultural impact and her celeb status?\n\nCBC Kids News reached out to the USPTO for comment. They have yet to respond.", "description": "Kylie Jenner has submitted her viral \u201crise and shine\u201d meme for trademark.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/KylieJenner_thumbnail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
