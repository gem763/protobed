The Turkey-Russia deal already calls for a Kurdish withdrawal from the territories.\n\nIran could also potentially take advantage of the corridor, Klein said.\n\n\u201cThis could be very dangerous for America\u2019s war against ISIS and also a lot of concern today about Iran\u2019s position in this area,\u201d he stated.\n\nKlein noted the U.S. could still be engaged in the area to secure oil fields and ensure against an Islamic State resurgence without committing larger troop numbers.\n\n\u201cThere are still some things that the United States can do,\u201d stated Klein.\n\n\u201cWe still do have some troops in the Kurdish villages near the oil fields. America also has bases in Iraq, but the problem is that now we need Iraqi permission \u2013 Iraq and Iran are very close \u2013 but Iraqi permission to carry out airstrikes in Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then also potentially America can try to enforce some sort of no-fly zone over this area but that would be a big gray zone as well because does America really want to get into an air match with a fellow NATO country, Turkey? But it is not over a yet and there are still some things that the Trump administration can do.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump lifted sanctions on Turkey and declared his policy concerning Syria a \u201cbig success\u201d after Turkey said it would halt attacks on Syrian Kurdish forces.\n\nPresident @realDonaldTrump just announced a major breakthrough toward achieving a better future for Syria and the Middle East. pic.twitter.com/rjykmSmdWw \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) October 23, 2019\n\nOn Monday, Trump said a small number of American troops would remain in Syria \u201cto secure the oil\u201d and separately to protect an area in southern Syria at the request of Israel and Jordan.", "description": "In a segment on Israeli television, Breitbart Jerusalem bureau chief expressed concern Iran could attempt to fill the power vacuum in northeast Syria following the U.S. withdrawal from that territory and a deal between Russia and Turkey to jointly patrol the area. | Clips", "authors": ["Breitbart Jerusalem"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Turkish-forces-in-Syria-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
