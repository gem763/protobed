But Facebook hasn't faltered \u2014 instead, it held a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, on October 14, where the remaining 21 members of the association met to formalize the council and elect a board of directors.\n\nAnd according to David Marcus, the head of the Facebook subsidiary Calibra that is leading the project, whether or not you trust Facebook doesn't matter. Marcus pointed to the fact that the Libra Association (of which Facebook will just be another member) will bear the burden of making key decisions when it comes to how the system is governed, and noted that the technology that it's built on is open-sourced, meaning anyone can use it.\n\n\"We want to design this network in such a way that whether you trust or not Facebook is irrelevant to this venture,\" Marcus said when speaking with a small group of journalists on Monday. \"Because it solves real problems for real people. And if you don't want to trust Facebook, you'll have 100 other different wallets to choose from. And at the network level, we won't control it. So trust Facebook or not, it won't matter.\"\n\nThe association will undoubtedly have to combat heavy skepticism from regulators moving forward. Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee Maxine Waters and other Democrats have urged Facebook to cease plans to implement the currency until regulators can examine concerns and take action. The committee grilled Marcus in July on a range of issues, including how the currency would be regulated and whether or not Facebook's role in creating the system and implementing a wallet for it in its own apps would give it too much power.\n\nRead more: Facebook's blockchain boss David Marcus defends the feasibility of Libra after a quarter of its partners drop out\n\nThat notion isn't lost on Marcus, who again reiterated that the technology is open-sourced and free, and that the network will be governed by the association, not Facebook. \"If that doesn't tell you that we're keenly not tone deaf and actually quite aware of the realization that Facebook \u2014 or for that matter any other company \u2014 should not control a network that is central to moving money around the world, then I don't know what does,\" he said.\n\nWhen Marcus testified in front of the House Financial Services Committee in July, lawmakers seemed uncomfortable with Facebook's ambitions to launch a new cryptocurrency as early as next year given the many unanswered questions about how it would be regulated. But Marcus said that while a 2020 launch is still the goal, it will entirely depend on whether or not the proper regulatory framework is obtained.\n\n\"We're not going to launch this thing until it gets the proper licensing regime and oversight for approach and we've had a chance to address the legitimate concerns that were raised,\" he said. \"It will take the time that it will take, but I still hope that 2020 is an option.\"\n\nThat 2020 goal, he says, will hopefully be a motivating factor to speed up discussions and make progress.\n\n\"If you're announcing something like this and you're saying we'll see whenever it happens, it doesn't work,\" he said. \"So you have to focus everyone on a clear deadline so you can get things done.\"\n\nMoving forward, the governing power will rest in the hands of the association \u2014 not Facebook. However, that doesn't mean Congress will stop looking to Facebook for answers. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before the House Financial Services Committee on October 23, to discuss the social giant's impact on financial services and housing sectors, and questions about Libra will likely come up.\n\nBut since its the association that's tasked with governing Libra, it's unclear exactly how much insight Zuckerberg will be able to provide. \"He'll be free to talk about why he thought it was a good idea to build this and the intention behind it,\" Marcus said.\n\nMarcus hasn't been discouraged by the level of scrutiny Libra has faced nor the fact that several key partners have already dropped out. When asked whether he had approached other large tech firms like Apple, Google, and Amazon about joining the association \u2014 to which he responded that they've had \"very open conversations with a lot of those companies\" and many others \u2014 Marcus said having partners join so early on is a good thing. It shows that they know what they're getting into, and are motivated to see it through regardless.\n\n\"Only companies that are really motivated to making this happen will have the fortitude and the courage to carry on,\" he said.", "description": "Facebook's David Marcus is confident in the company's cryptocurrency plans despite the fact that lawmakers are skeptical.", "authors": ["Lisa Eadicicco"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da8dad14af909404d096d23?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
