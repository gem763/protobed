In the last few years, the music industry in India is gradually on the rise. Whether it's country music, regional or an increase in rappers, these are Indie musicians who are taking over the music world and HOW.\n\nThese artists are here to prove that Bollywood is all about remixes but original content always rules the roost. Here are some of my personal favourites that should totally make way into your playlist.\n\n1. Jasmine Sandlas\n\nInstagram/Jasmine Sandles\n\nShe was raised in California and India and that's how she figured that mixing the two cultures smoothly in music is something she's interested in. In 2014, she began her Bollywood playback singing career with the song \"Yaar Na Miley\" for the film Kick. Upon its release, \"Yaar Na Miley\" went viral and topped the charts and Sandlas received wide critical acclaim for her singing style as well as earned several awards, including \"Most popular song of year 2016.\n\n2. Prabh Deep\n\nDon't Miss 1 K SHARES 181 SHARES 474 SHARES 158 SHARES\n\nGifted with a unique voice that contains traces of traditional Punjabi folk singers, Prabh Deep is widely acknowledged as one of the best underground MCs in the country. He's leading Delhi's hip hop scene by storm. He was spotted at the finale of Ziro Festival of Music making the crowd sway to his songs.\n\n3. Madstar Base\n\nThey are the alternative music scene and culture in India. They were first spotted in Magnetic fields churning out old music with garden fresh beats. Their music can make any room shake with joy and keep the dance floors stacked.\n\n4. RAGA\n\nTwitter\n\nHe's a rapper, lyricist, producer and singer. His songs Naayak and Jaamna paar got him the real claim to fame. Speaking to one of the publications about how grateful he is, RAGA says, Naayak hits 600k Downloads this month and it's not even a year yet since it was released. Getting shout outs and help from the mainstream artists such as RAFTAAR, IKKA, LIL GOLU, PARICHAY, AKAY and a few more is the biggest achievement for me till date.\"\n\nHe goes by the real name Ravi Mishra and is changing the Delhi rapping scenes in big ways.\n\n5. Jeet Singh Negi\n\numjb\n\nHe is considered to be the father of modern Garhwali folk music. He gave voice to Garhwali music and we couldn't be more thankful.\n\n6. Komorebi\n\nThe name actually means sunlight passing through the leaves in Japanese. Komorebi is a Delhi-based electronica duo Komorebi and my most favourite from the list. They're an experimental project inspired from Japanese animation. If you're lucky, you may catch them at Pianoman Jazz Club in Delhi someday.\n\nKomorebi is here to tell you that there is a world of music outside Bollywood which is unconventional yet beautiful.\n\n7. Paloma Majumdar\n\nFondly nicknamed \u201cKolkata\u2019s Adele\u201d by her friends, Paloma has a powerhouse personality and tone. After studying Comparative Literature in Jadavpur University and making her mark as a dancer and choreographer in Kolkata\u2019s performance art circles, Paloma decided to explore more of her passion for music. And we're glad\n\n8. Oorka\n\nHindi news\n\nI saw them perform at the Ziro festival of music and they got us hooked to their foot tapping numbers. Members of the Chennai based band Oorka precisely know how to get the world grooving. Their motto is simple. Oorka aspire to make music that is rooted yet touches new horizons.\n\nThis high energy classic Tamil Rock anthem talks about self-introspection. They usually don't perform at the conventional venues, which is why you have to follow them to know their gig whereabouts.\n\n9. Rounak Maiti\n\nThis singer-songwriter shuttles between Mumbai and Los Angeles. Slow guitar, beautiful pattern, easing the listeners are just some of the things this artists beings on the table. His Another Room, Another Wall and The Whole World Is watching is by far our favourite ones.\n\n10 Chochuna Dema\n\nScreengrab/Orange festival\n\nChochung Dema is a singer songwriter from the beautiful hills and valleys of Arunachal Pradesh now based in the capital. She's active in the live music circuit and you should follow her on her social media to know where she plays next. A friend attended her gig and said that she killed it with her performance. Watch out for her.\n\n11. Amrit Rao the Madrascals\n\nHindu\n\nThey use music as a medium for social commentary. The best part about this band is they make you believe that language is not a barrier and more about the stage act. The lyrics of all their songs talk about social issues. One of the topics is the abundance of water during the Chennai floods and the lack of it in a month\u2019s time.You have to hear them to believe it.\n\nDo you have any favourites we missed out on?
