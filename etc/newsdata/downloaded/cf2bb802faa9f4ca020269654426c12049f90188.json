REUTERS/Sergio Maldonado\n\nThe union said it made a counterproposal and warned \u201cthere are still many important issues that remain unresolved.\u201d Also on Tuesday, GM said the strike by U.S. workers forced it to halt production at its pickup and transmission plants in Silao, Mexico, resulting in temporary layoffs of 6,000 workers.\n\nAbout 48,000 UAW members went on strike on Sept. 16 seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the leading U.S. automaker\u2019s profit and protection of healthcare benefits.\n\nUAW Vice President Terry Dittes told members in a letter the GM offer \u201ccame up short\u201d on issues like healthcare, wages, temporary workers and job security, \u201cto name a few.\u201d The union said it is committed \u201cto exploring all options in order to reach an agreement.\u201d\n\nGM said in a statement it continues \u201cto negotiate and exchange proposals, and remain committed to reaching an agreement that builds a stronger future for our employees and our company.\u201d\n\nThe statements on \u201ccomprehensive proposals\u201d indicate the talks have shifted into a higher gear as the dispute is taking a toll on both the automaker and striking UAW workers, whose $250 a week from the union strike fund is a fraction of their normal pay. Analysts estimate the strike could cost GM over $1 billion.\n\nBoth sides face broader risks should the U.S. economy slow down. Data released on Tuesday showed the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in September to its weakest level in more than a decade. Stocks fell broadly on the report, and GM\u2019s share price was down more than 3%.\n\nThe strike had previously forced GM to lay off at least 2,000 Canadian workers and temporarily close an engine plant in Mexico. Many suppliers have halted or scaled back some operations.\n\nJP Morgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman estimated in a research note that the strike has cost GM over $1 billion but it may be able to recover some lost profit in the fourth quarter. He said GM has $82 million a day in lost profit.\n\nGM in Mexico said that \u201cfor the moment\u201d its three other Mexican plants \u2013 Ramos Arizpe, San Luis Potosi and Toluca \u2013 are working normally. A spokesman in Mexico said the plants still had parts available but the company could not say how many more days the plants would remain open. The spokesman declined to estimate the daily cost of suspending operations at the Silao complex.\n\nThe 6,000 affected workers are being paid a percentage of their salary, the spokesman said, with some workers using vacation time to continue receiving their full salaries.", "description": "The United Auto Workers union said on Tuesday it rejected a new comprehensive offer from General Motors Co to end a two-week-old strike, saying the automaker came up short on several fronts including wages, healthcare and temporary workers.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436064710&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9100M", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
