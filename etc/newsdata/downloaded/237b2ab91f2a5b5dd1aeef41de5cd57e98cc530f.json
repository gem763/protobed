Even though gunshots were the most common method of suicide among veterinarians, the study indicated that 37 percent were caused by pharmaceutical poisoning.\n\nOverall, 75 percent of veterinarians who committed suicide worked in a small animal practice, according to the report.\n\nThe New York State Veterinary Medical Society is responding, in part, through a 24-hour mental health hotline and in-person counseling. The society will hold a three-day education conference next month for early career veterinarians, seasoned practitioners and licensed technicians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of 2018, there were 113,394 veterinarians living in the United States, more than 60 percent of whom were women, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\nFor the study, researchers reviewed records on 11,620 veterinarians who died from 1979 through 2015, with data coming from the American Veterinary Medical Association and CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nSuicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S., and 1 of 3 leading causes that are on the rise, according to the CDC.\n\nThough suicide is seldom caused by a single factor, the CDC says factors that may contribute to the veterinary suicide rates include work overload and practice management responsibilities, debt, poor work-life balance and access to euthanasia solution for animals as well as the training to calculate a dose that could be lethal to humans.\n\nTo help guide suicide prevention within the profession, the study points to a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health framework used to curb workplace hazards and risks.\n\n\u201cCollaboration among multiple stakeholders in the profession such as professional associations, veterinary schools, and suicide prevention experts could help contribute to an effective and comprehensive suicide prevention strategy,\u201d said Institute director Dr..
