Lindsey Graham has in the last year become something of a congressional point man for President Donald Trump\u2019s negotiations with Turkey, leading discussions on everything from Ankara\u2019s purchase of a Russian missile system over the summer to their more recent incursion into northern Syria.\n\nSo when he received a call from a man he thought was Turkey\u2019s minister of defense earlier in August, it didn\u2019t strike him as unusual. \u201cThank you so much for calling me, Mr. Minister,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI want to make this a win-win, if we can.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t the Turkish defense minister at all. Instead, it was Alexey Stolyarov and Vladimir Kuznetsov, Russian pranksters with suspected ties to the country\u2019s intelligence services who go by \u201cLexus and Vovan.\u201d The duo have become notorious in recent years for their cold calls to unwitting, high-profile Western politicians, including Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, leading some to suspect that they\u2019ve had help from the Kremlin, according to The Guardian. (A Schiff spokesman said at the time that the House Intelligence Committee \u201cinformed appropriate law enforcement and security personnel of the conversation.\u201d)\n\nKevin Bishop, a spokesman for Graham, confirmed the call\u2019s authenticity to POLITICO. \u201cWe have been successful in stopping many efforts to prank Senator Graham and the office, but this one slipped through the cracks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey got him.\u201d\n\nThe substance of Graham\u2019s conversation with Stolyarov, who was posing as Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, is newly relevant in light of the South Carolina senator\u2019s push for sanctions on Turkey as punishment for their offensive against the Kurds in northern Syria. Graham labeled the Kurds a \u201cthreat\u201d to Turkey in the call, seemingly contradicting what he has said publicly in recent days.\n\nGraham also mentions Trump\u2019s personal interest in a \u201cTurkish bank case\u201d in the call that appears to refer to a U.S. case involving Reza Zarrab, an Iranian-Turkish gold trader and client of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Trump had asked then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in 2017 to help persuade the Justice Department to drop the Zarrab case.\n\nThe pranksters\u2019 conversation with Graham, a Trump ally who has the president\u2019s ear on national security issues, also raises obvious questions about potential security breaches. While the pranks appear on their face to have been relatively harmless, the incident suggests it\u2019s getting easier for bad actors to elicit sensitive information from policymakers. Stolyarov provided POLITICO with a recording of their call.\n\nIn the call, Graham was primarily concerned with getting Turkey back into the F-35 program and urging the \u201cdefense minister\u201d to refrain from using Russia\u2019s S-400 anti-aircraft weapon system, which was fully delivered to Turkey last month in defiance of requests from the U.S. and NATO.\n\nBut Graham also expressed sympathy for Turkey\u2019s \u201cKurdish problem\u201d and described the Kurds as a \u201cthreat.\u201d Those private comments appear to contradict his public statements this week, in which he criticized Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria because it\u2019s \u201cwrong to abandon the Kurds, who have been strong allies against\u201d the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cYour YPG Kurdish problem is a big problem,\u201d Graham told the pranksters. He was referring to the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, a group that began fighting ISIS as part of the Syrian Democratic Forces in 2015\u2014with support from the U.S.\u2014but is considered a terrorist group by Turkey because of its push to establish an autonomous state for the Kurds on the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\n\u201cI told President Trump that Obama made a huge mistake in relying on the YPG Kurds,\u201d Graham continued. \u201cEverything I worried about has come true, and now we have to make sure Turkey is protected from this threat in Syria. I\u2019m sympathetic to the YPG problem, and so is the president, quite frankly.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Trump acknowledged as much in a press conference on Wednesday, appearing to echo Graham\u2019s private comments. \u201cIf you read today \u2014 a couple of reports saying that when President Obama started this whole thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAs you know, it was started by President Obama; he created a natural war with Turkey and their longtime enemy, PKK. And they\u2019re still there.\u201d Turkey has been in conflict with the P.K.K., also known as the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, since the 1980s. Both Turkey and the U.S. consider it a terrorist organization.", "description": "Republican Sen.
