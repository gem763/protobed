Levels of violence have been rising. (Danish Siddiqui/Reuters)\n\nBut the images that shocked people the most came from a subway car. After ordering trains stopped, the police tactical squad (nicknamed \"Raptors\") raided the station looking for protesters on their way home.\n\nVideo shows them beating and pepper-spraying four young passengers who were neither questioned nor arrested at the scene, simply left cowering in a corner of the carriage. (Two were later arrested, after the public outcry.)\n\nWitnesses later said it seemed like the officers were just lashing out at anyone they could out of anger and frustration.\n\nMany called it exactly the kind of police abuse that needs to be investigated by an independent inquiry \u2014 one of the protesters' key demands. But authorities seemed to dismiss it as normal police work.\n\nHong Kong's Secretary for Security John Lee said the officers were just \"upholding the law\" and \"trying to reduce the injuries and harm to everyone.\"\n\nHe insisted the police force is still \"Asia's finest.\"\n\nIt's clear positions on both sides \u2014 police and protesters \u2014 have toughened, along with their strategies. And that's turned the political battle for greater democracy into a very real fight for control of the streets.\n\nYoung people like Jack are at the heart of it. He's 19, too afraid of police to give his last name, but not afraid to confront them on the streets. Every chance he gets.\n\n\"Sure, it's getting harder,\" he said through a broad face mask that covered all but his eyes, \"but we will keep fighting.\"\n\nJack stood waiting for the next protest to begin, outfitted in full protest combat gear: yellow construction helmet, black T-shirt, gas mask and heat-resistant gloves to throw hot tear gas canisters back at the police.\n\nAnother young man, 17 year-old Morgan, sat on a curb nearby.\n\nPassengers try to flee as riot police arrives, outside the terminals at Hong Kong International Airport on Sunday.

Society simply cannot move on with this kind of confrontation.\" - Bonnie Leung, Civil Human Rights Front\n\nThis movement started as an effort to push the Hong Kong government to abandon a bill that could see anyone charged with a crime extradited to mainland China to face trial. Leader Carrie Lam reluctantly suspended work on the bill and declared it \"dead,\" but she would not withdraw it entirely.\n\nAnd since then, her government has mostly gone into hiding, refusing to discuss any other demands with protesters, including those aimed at expanding democratic rights and protecting freedoms in the face of greater control by the Beijing government.\n\nLam herself has only appeared in public occasionally to sternly condemn protesters and unequivocally support the police. Her private views seem less definitive, and even anguished.\n\nProtesters build barricades outside the airport terminals Sunday. (Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters)\n\nIn a leaked recording of a private speech she gave last week to Hong Kong businesspeople, she said she would \"quit\" if she could, but her backers in Beijing would not allow it.\n\nAnd despite a steely posture that has been disliked and mocked in Hong Kong, Lam said privately she feels that \"to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable,\" something she would have to apologize for \"deeply.\"\n\nShe also told the group Beijing has \"absolutely no plan\" to intervene with People's Liberation Army troops, who have a garrison in the middle of Hong Kong. This has been a constant worry for residents \u2014 as well as world leaders and observers abroad \u2014 who remember China's bloody crackdown against protesters in Tiananmen Square 30 years ago.\n\nMore explicit threat\n\nThe fear has been stoked by Chinese propaganda, showing mainland police and troops training to attack people dressed just like Hong Kong's protesters and characterizing them as nothing more than a spoiled and violent mob. Political demands are never mentioned.\n\nA weekend editorial in Beijing's state news service Xinhua made the threat even more explicit.\n\nIt said anyone who \"dares to infringe\" on China's national sovereignty or challenges the power of Beijing will \"be held accountable.\" And it warned \"the end is near\" for the protests, without laying out when or how.\n\nA barricade burns during a protest near the airport Sunday. (Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters)\n\nFor Bonnie Leung, that's exactly the wrong way to solve this standoff.\n\nLeung is the vice-convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), a group that has organized the biggest peaceful rallies of these protests, drawing more than a million people to the streets three times \u2014 once, over two million.\n\n'Making the problem worse'\n\nCHRF's request for another peaceful march this past weekend was turned down, and Yeung suspects that pushed many young people to make their statement another way: through violence.\n\nShe also said excessive force by the police may be \"making the problem worse,\" backfiring by making more protesters more radical.\n\nAfter watching the scenes of police beating young people on the subway, \"a lot of Hong Kong people feel the same desperation,\" Leung said.\n\n\"We are angry about the brutality of the police, but we have to find a way to solve that problem,\" she said, with tears in her eyes and a quiver in her voice. \"Because this is our home, this is our city.
