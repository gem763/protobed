Senior ICE officials will be holding briefings across the country to warn of the dangers of sanctuary policies.\n\nThose detainers request that local law enforcement notify immigration authorities when an illegal immigrant who has been arrested is due to be released from jail, so that they can be picked up by ICE and placed in deportation proceedings. Albence said that last year they deported more than 145,000 criminal illegal immigrants, including 10,000 gang members, and that about 70 percent of arrests ICE conducts occur via a detainer from a local or state jail or prison.\n\nBut with anti-ICE and open-border sentiments taking a growing hold among Democratic lawmakers and left-wing activists, a number of cities and states -- including New Jersey, California, Chicago and New York City -- have implemented sanctuary policies and refused to cooperate with law enforcement.\n\nAlbence pointed to a national ICE operation this week in which officers made 1,300 arrests. He said that of those, officers arrested nearly 200 who could have been arrested in jail if detainers had been honored.\n\nCBP CHIEF RIPS INTO 'RECKLESS' LAWMAKERS FOR ATTACKS ON BORDER AGENTS, WARNS IT'S HURTING MORALE\n\nOf those arrested, three had convictions for murder or manslaughter and 100 had convictions for sexual crimes -- with nearly half of those crimes involving children. Meanwhile, 70 had convictions for drug crimes and 328 had convictions for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\n\nAlbence gave the example of a man in Mecklenburg County, N.C., who was arrested for driving while intoxicated earlier this year. ICE filed a detainer but he was released. In June he was then arrested for two counts of assault on a female, assault by strangulation, assault with a deadly weapon and a DWI. He was again released, despite an ICE detainer.\n\n\"Hopefully we will find him before he hurts or kills another innocent victim,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that ICE could prevent numerous crimes if local law enforcement complied with detainers, and asked what those jurisdictions to say to the family of a victim of a crime committed by an illegal immigrant.\n\n\u201cFor those who support victims\u2019 rights, and who among us doesn\u2019t, how do we tell a grieving victim that the person who hurt you or your loved one that the crime was preventable if local law enforcement had merely honored a detainer or given us a phone call?\u201d he said. \u201cWho are these sanctuary cities really protecting?\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement who joined Albence at the podium echoed those sentiments.\n\n\u201cWe know that too often in the wake of these criminal aliens are left nothing but a trail of victims,\u201d said Sheriff Jim Skinner of Collin County, Texas.\n\nAlbence\u2019s questioning of whether liberal immigration policies are as compassionate as activists claim comes on the heels of Trump making a similar argument at the United Nations, where he slammed the \u201ccruel\u201d policies of open-border activists.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Today, I have a message for those open border activists who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of social justice: Your policies are not just, your policies are cruel and evil,\" he said Tuesday, accusing them of promoting human smuggling and the \"erasure of national borders.\"\n\n\u201cYou are empowering criminal organizations that prey on innocent men, women and children. You put your own false sense of virtue before the lives and well-being of countless innocent people,\u201d he said. \"When you undermine border security, you are undermining human rights and human dignity.\"", "description": "Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Matthew Albence on Thursday revealed\u00a0a recent ICE operation nabbed dozens of illegal immigrants with a record of child sex offenses, as he railed against the dangers of \"sanctuary cities\" he said put public safety at risk.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19269603240706-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
