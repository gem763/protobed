The Prime Minister met with China's Vice President Wang Qishan for almost an hour in Jakarta on Sunday. \"I simply made the point, which was well-received, that Australia is an independent, sovereign nation,\" he said. \"Yes, we are very much proud of our Western liberal democratic tradition, our open economy and our engagement with the rest of the world and that gives us a set of eyes that look into the world, very much from our perspective. \"But what we also stressed today was, is that we will never feel corralled into any sort of binary assessment of these relationships... which says pro-United States or pro-China.\" Image: News Corp Australia", "description": "Watch the Latest News.com.au Videos including Featured News Videos and Sports Videos and News Highlights.
