Austin said he was OK, I don't know exactly what that means but it is up in his [shoulder] \u2013 he also strained that in Washington last year.\"\n\nThe Rockets ended the preseason with a 4-2 record and hopes for a championship challenge are high after former Oklahoma City Thunder team-mates Harden and Westbrook were reunited in the offseason.\n\nD'Antoni was lost for words by Harden's display against the Heat. He connected with 8-of-16 three-pointers and played like it was game seven of the NBA Finals.\n\n\"That's the way he's wired - he loves to play,\" added D'Antoni. \"I couldn't take him out in the fourth quarter if I wanted to. He wanted to play and he'd play 48 minutes if he could.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"James was ridiculous. He gets better every time. I don't know what his ceiling is but he seems to be the most improved player of the year for me, he's ridiculous.\"\n\nHarden, meanwhile, was eager to get the regular season started after being asked for his initial feelings about how playing with Westbrook again had been.\n\n\"Great,\" the 2018 MVP said. \"Now preseason is over with and we get to the real thing. It's gonna be a long season of just trying to communicate and be on the same page, not only me and Russ - our entire team.\n\n\"This preseason was a good test for us, now we're excited for the real challenge.\"\n\nAsked if this was the most powerful Rockets team since he had been with the franchise, Harden added: \"Yeah, I think so.\"", "description": "Mike D'Antoni delivered a positive injury update on Russell Westbrook and hailed James Harden's display against the Miami Heat.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OMfqKW6IB3O8ZJZfsQS0fA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oiJhWDWa4J6_EJDRbtBeFA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/ee811847ab3281ea19ab9d71f9d29f7f", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
