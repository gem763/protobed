Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told attendees of his \u201cBernie\u2019s Back Rally\u201d in New York on Saturday that his movement aims to not only transform the U.S. but \u201ccreate a new America\u201d altogether.\n\nSanders held a rally at Queensbridge Park in Long Island City, New York, with guest appearances from left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore and \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), both of whom formally offered their endorsements of the presidential hopeful.\n\nThe socialist senator spoke following speeches from his endorsers and outlined his broad vision to not only radically transform the country but to \u201ccreate a new America\u201d altogether.\n\nSanders stated:\n\nStanding before you today, I believe more than I have ever believed, that we are at a moment in our great country\u2019s history where all of us coming together can create the America that we are entitled to have. The America we know that we can become.\n\n\u201cWe can create a new America true to the principles that are supposed to be the foundation of our democracy,\u201d he said, failing to elaborate on what he believes the country\u2019s founding principles are truly \u201csupposed to\u201d be.\n\nSanders\u2019 call for the creation of a \u201cnew America\u201d follows his recent pleas to fundamentally \u201ctransform\u201d the country.\n\nHe told attendees of his rally at Denver\u2019s Civic Center in September that the 2020 election is about more than defeating President Trump, and he asked them to help him \u201ctransform this country\u201d and wage \u201ca political revolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am here in Denver asking your support for more than just defeating Trump,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI am here to ask you to help me transform this country and create an economy and government that works for all of us, not just the one percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am here in Denver to ask you to wage with me a political revolution, which will take on not only the corruption of Washington but the greed and corruption of the corporate elite in this country,\u201d he added.\n\nAs Axios noted in August, Sanders\u2019 utopian vision for the country \u2013 offering \u201cfree\u201d health care and college, exponentially raising taxes, and implementing a multi-trillion-dollar proposal to combat \u201cclimate change\u201d \u2013 would essentially \u201creorder or referee almost every part of American life.\u201d\n\nSanders wrote on Instagram following his rally:", "description": "Sen.
