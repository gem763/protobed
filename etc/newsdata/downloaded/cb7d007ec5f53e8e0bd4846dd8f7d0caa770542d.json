(Maurizio Brambatti/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nHe was one of 90 people on staff at the university law school, with a reputation as being mild-mannered and formal. He showed up for work in well-designed suits with pocket squares. He taught two auditorium-size classes every semester.\n\nThen, in May 2018, as other faculty members pitched in to administer his courses\u2019 final exams, Giuseppe Conte abruptly went on leave.\n\nConte\u2019s initial departure was surprising enough: He\u2019d been pulled from the ranks of academia to become Italy\u2019s figurehead prime minister, a neutral \u2014 and intentionally obscure \u2014 arbiter for the two ambitious politicians joining their parties in a coalition.\n\nBut as that nationalist-populist coalition broke apart this summer, Conte\u2019s career has taken an even unlikelier turn. Rather than returning to the University of Florence, where his nameplate remains on his office door, Conte engineered a bid to stay on as prime minister and lead a new government that better fits his moderate political views \u2014 this time, while gaining broader power for himself.\n\n\u201cI think about where he was [15] months ago, and it is astonishing,\u201d said Patrizia Giunti, Conte\u2019s boss at the law school.\n\nThe government Italians are calling Conte II, sworn in Thursday morning at the presidential palace in Rome, was possible only because of Conte\u2019s transformation. After arriving in politics as a virtual unknown a little more than a year ago, Conte survived a topsy-turvy summer of backroom machinations, outmaneuvered powerful nationalist Matteo Salvini and emerged in the eyes of some Italians as a low-key, sober alternative to the boisterous personalities who have often dominated Italian politics.\n\n\n\nThe League party leader Matteo Salvini talks to journalists on Aug. 28. (Andrew Medichini/AP)\n\nItalian newspapers have noted another aspect of Conte\u2019s political transformation: Initially the nominal head of a government dominated by the far right, he\u2019ll now lead a coalition \u2014 between the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party \u2014 that is likely to skew more to the left.\n\n\u201cI can imagine that everybody is a bit tired\u201d of combative politics, said Cristina Fasone, a member of the political science department at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. \u201cThe personality of Conte is seen as one of a person who is moderate, who tries to reach compromise.\u201d\n\nConte, 55, is hardly guaranteed a long shelf life. Salvini\u2019s far-right League, which is now in the opposition, remains the country\u2019s most popular party. The new coalition, which must be confirmed by a vote in Parliament next week, is a combustible union of two parties that have long been vicious rivals. If the coalition is short-lived, new elections could vault Salvini into the prime minister\u2019s job.\n\n[He was Europe\u2019s fastest-rising politician. Now, Italy\u2019s far-right leader faces an uncertain future]\n\nMeantime, Conte has developed his own base of supporters. He often was depicted as subservient to Salvini and Five Star Movement chief Luigi Di Maio, his deputy prime ministers in the prior government; now, polls show that he is more trusted than both of them. In the new government, Conte will not have deputies at his flanks.\n\nPresident Trump, widely critical of most Western European leaders, recently called Conte a \u201cvery talented man\u201d \u2014 although it is unclear how much of Trump\u2019s admiration stems from the Salvini-led anti-migrant policies of the last government.\n\nAt home, part of Conte\u2019s cross-party appeal, analysts say, is his inoffensiveness. His social media feed is a throwback: short on opinion, rich with carefully worded diplomacy. He speaks rarely about his personal life (he is divorced, with one child).\n\nMore recently, though, Conte has also picked times to speak forcefully \u2014 to his political benefit. When Salvini broke apart the coalition of his anti-migrant League and Di Maio\u2019s anti-establishment Five Star Movement early last month, in a bid to force new elections and become prime minister, Conte delivered a viral speech in the Senate in which he upbraided Salvini for \u201cpolitical opportunism,\u201d calling him the \u201cinterior minister,\u201d as if to emphasize his place in the pecking order.\n\n\u201cLet me say that the interior minister has shown that he is following his own interests and those of his party,\u201d Conte said to applause as Salvini, seated next to him, shook his head.\n\nRather than face a no-confidence vote, Conte stepped down \u2014 but not before delivering a pro-European appeal that sounded like an audition for the next government.\n\nOne of Conte\u2019s friends, Ettore Maria Lombardi, said that Conte has shed the \u201cawkwardness\u201d that was evident when he first became prime minister. Lombardi recalled speaking to Conte after a June 2018 Group of Seven meeting, where Conte met Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\u201cHow had it felt?\u201d he recalled asking.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult time, but I had to put on a statesman\u2019s clothes, because it had to be done,\u201d he recalled Conte saying.\n\nLombardi, a lawyer and a former student of Conte\u2019s, said that he more resembles a natural politician now.\n\n\u201cOf course his acquired nature as an attorney and an academic will remain, but there\u2019s a drift toward another mind-set,\u201d Lombardi said. \u201cI\u2019ve been noticing it for a while now \u2014 a professionalization, a greater understanding of the dynamics.\u201d\n\nWhile working at the University of Florence, Conte did not speak much about politics, Giunti said. But it was there that he developed the connection that would serve as his springboard.\n\nAlfonso Bonafede had studied law at the University of Florence, also serving as a student assistant to Conte, and later rose through the ranks of the Five Star Movement. When the Five Stars were discussing potential ministers, Bonafede floated Conte\u2019s name. The initial idea was that Conte would be given the task of clearing the country\u2019s red tape and bureaucracy. But as the Five Stars hashed out a coalition with the League, Conte\u2019s role expanded.\n\n\u201cA lawyer for the people,\u201d Conte said in one of his first speeches to Italians.\n\nIn recent weeks, as the new government has taken form, Salvini has trained his ire on Conte, describing him as a sellout who has lost any populist credibility. \u201cLawyer for the elites,\u201d Salvini wrote on Facebook, sharing a photo of Conte and Merkel.\n\n\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte\u2019s new cabinet ministers attend their first meeting at Chigi Palace in Rome on Sept. 5. (Remo Casilli/Reuters)\n\nThe Conte II government, according to initial indications, may loosen some of Salvini\u2019s most assertive anti-migrant policies while working to patch up a relationship with the European Union that frayed during a year of populist pushback in Rome.\n\nThe new government is expected to nominate Paolo Gentiloni, a former Democratic Party prime minister, as European commissioner, in an initial conciliatory move, according to Italian media reports.\n\n\u201cItaly is returning to be a protagonist on the world stage,\u201d Conte said this week.\n\nTraditionally, when Italy changes governments, the outgoing prime minister hands a bell to the new prime minister, in a passing-of-the-baton ceremony. But Thursday, with Conte succeeding himself, a clerk simply handed the bell to Conte, who held it for a photo op. One newspaper, Il Fatto Quotidiano, used its front page Thursday for a photo illustration depicting the scenario in more dramatic terms. The image showed two Contes \u2014 Conte I handing the bell to Conte II.\n\nAt the bottom of the page, a downtrodden Salvini was shown slinking off to the sidelines.\n\nThe headline carried a message for the outgoing interior minister: \u201cBig kisses from Palazzo Chigi,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s residence.\n\nRead more\n\nItalian Premier Giuseppe Conte wins backing to form a new government \u2014 this time, without the far right\n\nMatteo Salvini is already Italy\u2019s most powerful politician.
