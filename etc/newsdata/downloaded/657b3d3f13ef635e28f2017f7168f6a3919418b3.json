Even though they\u2019re not the Expos - they are the Nationals, but they wouldn\u2019t have been the Nationals without the Expos.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo even though I never played there, I wasn\u2019t a part of the Nationals logo, but in actual speaking it\u2019s still the Expos franchise that has been moved to another site,\u201d he said.\n\nRomance bloomed in Parc Jarry in the north end of this French-speaking city in the spring of 1969 when its NL expansion team began play as the Expos. Montreal\u2019s baseball-starved fans, who welcomed Jackie Robinson with open arms with the minor league Royals in 1946, immediately fell in love and christened their team, \u201cnos amours\u201d - our loves.\n\nJarry Park, the intimate and rollicking 29,000-seat baseball stadium that took the same name as the municipal park where it was located, is no more. Its press box and the grandstand behind home plate are all that remain; they have been incorporated into one end of IGA Stadium, an 11,000-seat tennis venue that hosts the Canadian Open.\n\nOn the site where U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu now swings her tennis racket along Rue Gary-Carter, longtime Expos ace Steve Rogers began making major league hitters swing and miss his devastating slider as a rookie thrust into the franchise\u2019s first pennant race in 1973.\n\nChosen fourth by Montreal in the first round of the June 1971 draft, Rogers threw a one-hit shutout in his second major league start and went 10-5 with a 1.54 ERA for the Expos, who fell short of the NL East title in a five-team race to the wire.\n\n\u201cWe were not a ragtag bunch, but everybody on that team came from somewhere else,\u201d Rogers said from his home in Jenks, Oklahoma. \u201cWe had a handful of guys that came out of the organization, but that was it. So it was a real bonding situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen that focus down in September and everybody fighting, with all those other guys from experience with other organizations, it was really something very special. And it really felt like, \u2018Oh gosh, well this is a lot of fun. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll do this every year.\u2019 And so as we all know, that wasn\u2019t going to be the case,\u201d he said.\n\nLongtime Expos fan Marvin Matthews proposed to his future wife on the Olympic Stadium scoreboard when the couple attended what proved to be Montreal\u2019s final home game in 1994. The Expos had the best record in the majors when a strike canceled the season and the World Series.\n\nMatthews continued cheering for the team after he moved to Calgary in 1998, and after the Expos moved to Washington in 2005. He paced back and forth while following every step of the Nationals\u2019 playoff run this fall.\n\n\u201cWhen I correspond with some of the people in Montreal, they just don\u2019t understand how I can feel that way,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cI get more negative responses than positive responses by far. When I talk to my brother-in-law, he doesn\u2019t want to hear about the Nationals, don\u2019t bring it up with him. But I\u2019ve talked to some friends and fans and they get it, you know, they just don\u2019t have any feelings for the Nationals.\u201d\n\nBrad Wilkerson hit Montreal\u2019s last home run and was the last player to wear the Expos uniform when he participated in an exhibition tour in Japan after the 2004 season. He played one season in Washington before he was traded to Texas in the deal that brought Alfonso Soriano to the Nationals.\n\nWilkerson is pulling for Washington to win the World Series. And while he invites Expos fans to do the same, he understands the lack of attachment to the Nationals that he has experienced when he has returned to Montreal.\n\n\u201cThey really haven\u2019t claimed Montreal as being part of the franchise,\u201d Wilkerson said. \u201cAnd I think that is what has been hurting the Montrealers being fans of the Washington Nationals because they weren\u2019t really including the Expos history totally, and obviously that hurt a lot of Montreal fans and Montrealers throughout the process.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 approach to Expos history, including making available jersey numbers that were retired in Montreal for Raines, Andre Dawson, Gary Carter and Rusty Staub, riles some fans here.\n\nPerry Giannias has what is almost certainly the most extensive private collection of Expos memorabilia. He has brought back numerous former Montreal players to the city for fan festivals that have raised nearly $500,000 for charity.\n\n\u201cThey wore our jerseys during the summertime, which was the biggest stab in the back we\u2019ve had so far,\u201d Giannias said. \u201cThey say that they honor us, but yet you have \u2026 Yan Gomes wearing Andre Dawson\u2019s No. 10. Where\u2019s the honor in that? Or Carter Kieboom wearing No. 8? These guys don\u2019t know what honor is.\u201d\n\nA three-time All-Star second baseman with the Expos, Jose Vidro played the Nationals\u2019 first two seasons in Washington before he was traded to Seattle. He\u2019ll also be cheering for the Nationals\u2019 first World Series title, while remembering where they came from.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s easy to be part of the Washington Nationals,\u201d Vidro said. \u201cThey have a brand-new stadium, the city has turned out for them, they have close to 3 million fans a year.\n\n\u201cWe went through the tough times. Livan Hernandez, Brian Schneider, Wilkerson, all those guys that made the jump from one city to the other, in fact three cities, with Puerto Rico. So we went through the hard times for them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tim Raines started wearing the tricolor cap as a teen and proudly sported the Montreal Expos logo for years, all the way onto his Hall of Fame plaque.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Sean Farrell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/world_series-the_exports_baseball_22940_c0-166-2000-1332_s1200x700.jpg?57a2d0b88ec554b8e0204987e39a265fc9c9af31", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
