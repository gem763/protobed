Democrats say he\u2019s fought for corporations and against workers. The AFL-CIO opposed his nomination, calling him a union-busting lawyer.\n\nTrump\u2019s previous labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, resigned in July. Deputy Labor Secretary Pat Pizzella has been serving as acting secretary.", "description": "The GOP-led Senate voted along party lines to approve the son of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia to replace Alexander Acosta as labor secretary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8d1d3d1e0000a20373a1f1.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
