Around us, patches of water glint like signalling mirrors. Sat on deck in the mid-morning sun, only the occasional chug of a passing boat breaking the tranquillity, it\u2019s difficult to imagine the devastation wrought here eight years earlier.\n\nBack then, on the afternoon of 11 March 2011, the tsunami hit. Not a foaming mega-wave like you see in movies, but an unrelenting dark mass of water that chewed and churned everything in its path. When it had finished, close to 20,000 people in Japan\u2019s northern Tohoku region had lost their lives.\n\nThe tsunami doesn\u2019t get much coverage outside Japan these days, but on 25 September, when Fiji take on Uruguay in the Rugby World Cup in the town of Kamaishi \u2013 15 miles down the coast from Yamada Bay \u2013 Tohoku will be back in the spotlight. And as I found during a trip around Iwate, one of the six prefectures in Tohoku, it won\u2019t just be a time for remembrance. Many locals hope it will highlight both their recovery and all the region has to offer travellers.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The 118 legends are a mix of superstitions and myths starring creatures like the \u201ckappa\u201d, a cucumber-eating pond-dweller with a mischievous habit of pulling people into the water.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The daughter, goes the tale, took a horse as her lover, much to her father\u2019s dismay. In fact, he was so unimpressed he hung her equine beau from a mulberry tree, prompting the distraught daughter to kill herself so she and the dead horse could elope to heaven.\n\nThe attraction of travelling around Iwate for me, living in central Tokyo, isn\u2019t just being deep in nature; it\u2019s experiencing rural traditions. After Tono, I get more of both when I visit the 1,600m Mount Hachimantai in the far north of Iwate, a place known for its stunning autumnal colours, hiking trails and hot spring (onsen) bathing. I visit Toshichi Onsen, a rocky patch of mountainside dotted with steaming vents and milky outdoor baths that \u2013 in a bit of a throwback you sometimes find in Tohoku \u2013 include baths for nude mixed-gender bathing. I then spend the night at a traditional inn in Hachimantai\u2019s Matsukawa Onsen area, where I have a tatami mat room, a dinner that includes grilled river fish and mountain vegetable tempura, and I end the evening soaking in a piping-hot open-air bath surrounded by reddening maples.\n\nBut it\u2019s Kamaishi that grabs me the most. It\u2019s while there that I venture up to Yamada Bay, where from April to October fishermen run charters during which you can sample local specialities \u2013 scallops, oysters and a chewy kind of sea squirt called hoya \u2013 pulled straight from the sea.\n\nFrom here, you can also hike Michinoku Coastal Trail, which reaches 450 miles through Tohoku, from Hachinohe in Aomori Prefecture all the way south to Soma in Fukushima Prefecture, and includes a 16-mile section that passes through Kamaishi. I walk a small part of it one afternoon and its somewhat awkward \u201cAlps of the Ocean\u201d tag soon makes sense, with jagged rock formations that look like miniature mountains punctuating the shore. I visit the clifftop Sekihozenji temple on one side of Kamaishi, too, where a pure-white 48.5m statue of Kannon, the Buddhist goddess of mercy, stands guard over local fishermen. Climb the 100-plus steps inside Kannon and you get to share her sweeping bay views.\n\nIn Kamaishi, I also learn about the town\u2019s rugby heritage; how with steel-industry backing, the \u201cnorthern ironmen\u201d of Kamaishi\u2019s now-defunct Nippon Steel RFC won seven straight national championships in the 1970s and 1980s and how the new 6,000-seat stadium, built for the Rugby World Cup, will serve as a hub for community sports and events post-World Cup.\n\nLeaving more of an impact on me than anything, I find out why the Rugby World Cup coming to a town of just 35,000 matters so much to the many locals I meet. People like doctor and Kamaishi Seawaves RFC director Toshio Hamato, who lost his parents, wife and the youngest of his three daughters \u2013 just 19 months old \u2013 when the tsunami destroyed the family home. Mr Hamato uses one word that comes up time and again in the conversations I have in Kamaishi. Hope.\n\n\u201cAfter the tsunami it felt like there was nobody and nothing left here. But having the Rugby World Cup to build towards gave us hope,\u201d he says. \u201cLike rugby, you get knocked down, then you get up again. When the World Cup comes, we want to show everyone who visits \u2013 and everyone around the world who has helped with our recovery \u2013 that we are up again.\u201d\n\nTravel essentials\n\nBritish Airways and Japan Airlines fly from the UK to Tokyo from around \u00a3550 return.
