The latest publicity stunt on Mont Blanc is the last straw\n\nHave you heard about the rowing machine dumped on Mont Blanc? The dead octopus on Scafell Pike? Or the Vauxhall 4x4 parked on top of Snowdon? Not jokes, sadly. These are all true stories related to the endless piles of junk appearing on and around the summits of the world\u2019s mountains.\n\nLocal authorities in France rightly reacted with fury last week when a British charity climber \u2013 due to adverse weather conditions \u2013 abandoned the rowing machine he was attempting to carry to the summit of western Europe\u2019s highest mountain. Faced with the decision of compromising his own safety or leaving behind a large and heavy piece of gym equipment, Matthew Paul Disney made the only sensible choice at that point, which was to get down the mountain safely.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Matthew Paul Disney with the rowing machine, which he later abandoned on Mont Blanc.

Mont Blanc is a dangerous mountain, only to be attempted by people with serious mountaineering experience and in-depth knowledge of how to avoid hidden dangers such as avalanches and crevasses. Fifteen climbers died on the mountain last year. It is not a place for publicity stunts, but this is becoming a depressingly common occurrence on the busiest peaks.\n\nMount Everest has famously become an overcrowded mess in recent years, with hundreds of climbers each year stepping over oxygen bottles, broken tents, piles of human waste and even dead bodies . Scafell Pike, Ben Nevis and Snowdon \u2013 Britain\u2019s famous Three Peaks \u2013 have their own fair share of problems: 4kg of chewing gum was retrieved from the Scottish peak last year, along with the wrapper of a pack of peanuts from the 1980s.\n\nBanana skins and orange peel can take two years to biodegrade, crisp packets last 30 years and discarded plastic is killing our wildlife and entering our food chain. Mountains are wondrous places, offering an unrivalled sense of adventure and true wilderness, and it is our responsibility to keep them that way. So if you carry something up, make sure you carry it down, too.\n\n\u2022 Oli Reed is the editor of Trail magazine", "description": "The world\u2019s busiest peaks are now rubbish dumps, littered with tents and human waste.
