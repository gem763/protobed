Everything\u2019s fine, right? No, say strategists at UBS Group AG.\n\nA deterioration in earnings expectations is likely to get worse and poses the biggest threat to U.S. equities, strategists led by Francois Trahan wrote in a note. UBS says the expected rate of 12-month earnings growth will turn negative in the coming months.\n\n\u201cThere are many ways to assess the health of S&P 500 earnings, but at this stage no matter how you slice it, the trend is slowing,\u201d the strategists wrote in a note titled \u201cIf History Were A Perfect Guide...Stocks Would Be In A World of Trouble Here.\u201d\n\nThe firm\u2019s bearish case on earnings is built on a pattern where economic indicators and earnings growth tend to follow the cycle of interest rates. While the Federal Reserve is in easing mode now, last year it wasn\u2019t, and its rate hikes have yet to fully be felt by businesses. In UBS\u2019s estimation, the economy should bottom two years after the end of a hiking cycle -- in November 2020, a timeline that puts an earnings rebound after the second quarter of next year.\n\nIt\u2019s ominous for U.S. equities, which have remained resilient this year in the face of headwinds including weakening economic data. Third-quarter GDP, for instance, is supposed to show the U.S. economy grew 1.6%, down from the 2% rate in the prior quarter.\n\nIn spite of that, third-quarter results have hung tough, helping to push U.S. stocks to an all-time high on Monday as companies continue to post better-than-expected growth. About 80% of firms that have disclosed results beat forecasts so far, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. S&P 500 companies are now expected to report a 2.8% earnings decline compared with year-ago levels, outperforming forecasts from the beginning of the reporting season. Some analysts expect that number to firm up before the season\u2019s over.\n\nYet estimates for the fourth quarter are swiftly coming down. Analysts expect S&P 500 company profits to expand by 1% in the current period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That\u2019s down from 3.3% just a month ago. For this year, analysts see profits growing 1.7%.\n\nFor UBS, earnings expectations for the S&P 500 are closing in on turning negative, the strategists wrote, and expectations for small- and mid-cap indexes are already there. Take, for instance, the number of companies with negative EPS growth, which has more than doubled since the beginning of the year to 160 from 68, according to UBS.\n\nIt spells trouble for U.S. markets -- across history, a contraction in earnings has been a key catalyst to bear markets, wrote the UBS strategists, and theirs isn\u2019t the only firm to ring this warning bell.\n\nSeveral recessions have not been accompanied by bear markets, as was the case in 1960 and 1980, for instance, according to Dan Suzuki, a portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors. And several bear markets were not accompanied by recessions, as happened in 1987, he wrote in a note this week. But there\u2019s never been a bear market that didn\u2019t occur within six months of a profit recession.\n\n\u201cWe see a better than even chance of a profit recession in the coming quarters alongside indications of shrinking liquidity,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s generally not a good sign for markets.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Sarah Ponczek and Lu Wang.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Vildana Hajric in New York at vhajric1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeremy Herron at jherron8@bloomberg.net, Chris Nagi\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Stocks vault to a record smack in the middle of earnings season.
