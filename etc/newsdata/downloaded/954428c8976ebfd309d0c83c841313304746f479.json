And it was unclear late Wednesday whether the deal, if approved, would end the boycotts by sports leagues, businesses and others that have harmed the state\u2019s reputation and economy.\n\nThe law in question, often referred to as House Bill 2, was signed in March 2016 by the state\u2019s governor at the time, Pat McCrory, a Republican. One of the most contentious measures requires transgender people in public buildings to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate.\n\nPhil Berger, the Senate leader, and Tim Moore, the House speaker, announced late Wednesday that they had reached the agreement with the new Democratic governor, Roy Cooper. A bill repealing House Bill 2, which the legislature will consider on Thursday, would also create a moratorium on local nondiscrimination ordinances through 2020 and leave regulation of \u201cmulti-occupancy facilities,\u201d or bathrooms, to state lawmakers.", "description": "The law had elicited an outcry from liberals and businesses that said it allowed discrimination against transgender individuals.", "authors": ["Richard Fausset"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/30/us/30CAROLINA-1/30CAROLINA-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2017-03-29"}
