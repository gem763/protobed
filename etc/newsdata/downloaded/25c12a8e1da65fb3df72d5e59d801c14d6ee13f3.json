We\u2019ll see.\n\n\u201cI think a lot can happen in football in a short time. The next round is not coming tomorrow. We have to respect the fact they have good players.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Man United will bring a strong team here.\u201d\n\nLampard got a first home win as Chelsea boss thanks to goals from Ross Barkley, Michy Batshuayi\u2019s brace, Pedro\u2019s penalty, Kurt Zouma, Reece James and Callum Hudson-Odoi.\n\nBut the bigger picture was Lampard handing debuts to four academy graduates as well as a first start for Billy Gilmour.\n\nGilmour was a stand-out performer in midfield and fellow rookies James and Marc Guehi also impressed, while there was a welcome return for England winger Hudson-Odoi, his first appearance since picking up an Achilles injury in April.\n\nAfter Lampard sent on two more debutants as substitutes, Tino Anjorin and Ian Maatsen, the Blues finished the night with six academy starlets on the pitch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased some players who have not been playing so many minutes played, there were some debuts, and the young lads who came on improved the team which was nice,\u201d added Lampard.\n\nMatt Green hit a spectacular goal for Grimsby to make it 2-1 but that was as good as it got for the League Two minnows.\n\nPA", "description": "Frank Lampard can get a measure of revenge on Manchester United after Chelsea drew them in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup.
