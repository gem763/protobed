They were looking for highly mobile young tech enthusiasts who could, as Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick would later put it, \u201calways be hustling\u201d.\n\nThey found me because I had just written a cover story for Newsweek on Europe\u2019s internet boom.\n\nAntfactory\u2019s panglossian goal was to become the Idealab of Europe; a place where start-ups would be not only funded but also created and shaped. In those very-far-away-seeming days of \u201cCool Britannia\u201d, it somehow managed to persuade a range of companies including Citigroup to give them $US120 million to invest in European dotcom start-ups.\n\nThey found me because I had just written a cover story for Newsweek on Europe\u2019s internet boom. \u201cEurope\u2019s Got Net Fever,\u201d screamed the headline. \u201cThe Symptoms Are Clear \u2013 Hot New Companies, Job Offers Featuring Ferraris and a Certain Swagger as Bright Young Businessfolk Stake Their Claims in Cyberspace.\u201d\n\nYes, it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to write these words now. If I had thought much about it, I\u2019d have realised I was coming in as the roller-coaster was shifting into free fall. The covers of American news magazines have been proven to be a reliable counter-indicator of what\u2019s happening in the markets.\n\nThe slide began a little over a year after that cover. But there was still plenty of time to spin a story of building \u201cscale\u201d and \u201csynergy\u201d in the as-yet-fragmented European internet market. Unlike the US, which already had a base of 121 million users who spoke the same language and wanted to buy more and more of the same stuff online, Europe was a collection of countries, each with a unique culture and individual internet markets; the euro had only just been introduced. But optimism was the common language.\n\nShe promptly bought an apartment so stunning it was featured in The New York Times, and became a start-up investor.\n\nAntfactory, its founders touted, as they collected cheques from established investors in the City, would sit in the centre of it, leveraging these wonderful new economies of scale. It would find the best European dotcoms \u2013 in travel, in music, in finance, in health \u2013 and mash them together, boosting their global presence and stock valuations.\n\nExchanges from London to Frankfurt to Paris would compete to take these new companies public. Riches would be had by all. After all, why have six different travel-booking sites (serving France, Italy, Spain, and so on) when you could have one?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom where I sat, in my dingy Manhattan office, this was an appealing proposition. In the US, the migration from print publications to online was under way. At Newsweek, we were beginning to suspect our world wouldn\u2019t be the same for much longer. Free dinner was still served to editorial staff in the wood-panelled penthouse that had once been a conference room for General Motors. But the company had, to the dismay of the old-timers, finally started cutting back on the expense-able (and often excessive) drinking on the nights that we\u2019d go to press. That, too, was the sign of a market shift.\n\nSo were the fortunes of people like Laurel Touby, one of the freelance writers for the last magazine I\u2019d worked for, Working Woman. Laurel had left journalism to start up a networking group for creative types in online media. I remember once saying to her, \u201cLaurel, you should really give up journalism and start a business.\u201d She did, growing her informal networking group into mediabistro.com, which cornered the market for media and PR job listings and was later sold for $US23 million. She promptly bought an apartment so stunning it was featured in The New York Times, and became a start-up investor.\n\nThe idea of trading in the punishing demands of reporting to partake of the riches of the internet was certainly on my mind as I considered Antfactory\u2019s offer. I loved being a journalist, but it offered a predictable trajectory: write more features, maybe become a senior editor or a columnist, watch my salary inch up by a paltry 2 per cent every year. Antfactory, on the other hand, offered something new and inherently appealing to a business journalist: the chance to get into the game, rather than just write about it. I told the Ants that I\u2019d come to London to discuss the offer.\n\nThe partners, as it turned out, didn\u2019t know much more about technology than me. One had worked mostly in entertainment and luxury brands. Two others were London finance guys, including one whose family was big in Greek shipping. I was a good enough reporter to appreciate the shortcomings of the team.\n\nStill, the idea of being able to waltz into a high-tech incubator as a partner and scout deals at the height of the dotcom boom was exciting. The stock options might actually be worth something. In a worst-case scenario, I told myself, I would go back to journalism knowing a lot more about the tech industry than I did before I worked in it.\n\nI moved to London in December 1998 and plunged into the dotcom scene, where I soon encountered the European equivalent of Laurel\u2019s brainchild \u2013 a networking salon-cum-headhunting site called First Tuesday. It had been founded in part by Nick Denton, a former Financial Times journalist who would eventually go on to start Gawker, and a Silicon Valley transplant named Julie Meyer. Both of them were more businesspeople than technologists. The DNA of the London start-up scene reflected the DNA of the city itself: it was about money and dealmaking.\n\nOf that, there was plenty. New jobs \u2013 and new companies \u2013 were being posted on First Tuesday\u2019s website every few minutes. At networking events, Denton and Meyer made it easy to see where the money was \u2013 potential investors wore red dots on their lapels; the \u201ctalent\u201d wore green. The reds, who were rarer and inevitably more popular, would often emerge exhausted after fighting off eager greens over cheap wine and snacks. The group claimed that $US100 million worth of deals had been cut in this manner. I didn\u2019t really believe them, but I didn\u2019t entirely not believe them.\n\nThe obvious corollary to winner-take-all is loser gets nothing, and there will inevitably be many more losers than winners. \u2014 Hal Varian\n\nEither way, one thing was clear: there was money to be made. It was the roaring \u201990s after all, in London as well as in Silicon Valley. If the 1980s began the age of greed, then the late 1990s cemented it. It was the era of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, who continued much of the market deregulation that had started under Reagan and Thatcher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a period when the notion of retiring comfortably with a gold watch and a pension began to slip away, replaced by soccer moms reading Money magazine and hoping to become stockpicking millionaires overnight.(My own mother, a first-grade teacher, was \u2013 incredibly \u2013 dabbling in biotech stocks, an experiment which shaved 30 per cent off her retirement.)\n\nAntfactory was, essentially, doing the same \u2013 dabbling in things nobody knew enough about. But it was clear to me that the people in charge didn\u2019t have the experience and insight to pull it off.\n\nMost of the opportunities we were looking at were copycats of successful start-ups that had already launched, or ill-advised attempts to create internet arms of existing legacy brands. Although the founders kept a deal flow going and the press kept writing naively positive stories about London\u2019s homegrown tech incubator, internally the firm was already starting to revert to what it really was \u2013 a collection of ex-City bankers looking to make a quick buck.\n\nWhen you pull back the lens, that\u2019s really what much of the late 1990s/early 2000s dotcom boom was all about. Far away in Silicon Valley, a handful of companies such as Google, Amazon and PayPal were carving out sustainable niches \u2013 and then ringfencing those markets. Then there was everyone else.\n\nAs Hal Varian, who would become Google\u2019s chief economist, put it in 2001: \u201cThe obvious corollary to winner-take-all is loser gets nothing, and there will inevitably be many more losers than winners.\u201d\n\nTrue enough. But the frenzy of financial activity was being fuelled by more than just your typical market forces. In retrospect, it reflected the increasingly tight links between the world\u2019s financial capitals and tech hubs, and the halls of power in places like Washington and Brussels. The tech industry had lobbied successfully in the 1990s against new accounting standards that would have forced companies to mark the value of options on their books.\n\nToday, companies such as Apple and Google can take advantage of ultra-low interest rates (which themselves were a response to the 2008 crisis) to issue loads of bonds on the US debt markets and then use the proceeds to pay back the richest shareholders in the form of tax preferential buybacks and dividends, further increasing the wealth divide.\n\nThe turning point this time may be Uber\u2019s IPO on May 10, one of the most anticipated in history but, in the end, a dismal failure.\n\nBack in early 2000, a different problem was emerging \u2013 the dotcom boom was turning to bust. The value of the Nasdaq index peaked on March 10 2000. On March 20, Barron\u2019s ran a cover story entitled \u201cBurning Up: Warning \u2013 Internet Companies Are Running Out of Cash, Fast.\u201d It\u2019s incredible how similar it seems to the negative sentiment around tech today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, as now, companies were starting to issue reversals of revenue statements, and investors began to realise that many previously lauded start-ups were more style than substance. Once the Fed decided to raise interest rates, the die was cast. The \u201ceasy money\u201d had officially run out. Or at least until it was time to reflate the market and create tech bubble 2.0.\n\nBy September 2001, Antfactory\u2019s investors had lost patience with the leadership, and demanded they return a $US120 million cash pile and wind down the firm. I often think about those disastrous years and wonder what has changed in the tech world \u2013 and what hasn\u2019t.\n\nToday\u2019s tech market is so much more developed, with vastly better infrastructure and game-changing innovations such as ubiquitous smartphones. We are only just beginning to move into artificial intelligence, the internet of things, 5G and other areas that many businesses are counting on to propel revenue growth in the future. Certainly, it is harder for companies to receive funding just by sticking \u201c.com\u201d behind their names.\n\nSearch engine AltaVista was founded in 1995 and after losing ground to Google was purchased by Yahoo! in 2003. The service was closed in 2013. MediaNews Group\n\nStill, there are many things about the current economy that remind me of my time in London. Then, as now, we were in the late stages of a credit cycle, with too much money chasing too little value.\n\nInvestors who were counting on a spate of hot IPOs to buoy the late stage of a boom market were disappointed. Back then, the infamous Pets.com went out of business nine months after its IPO.\n\nThe turning point this time may be Uber\u2019s IPO on May 10, one of the most anticipated in history but, in the end, a dismal failure. It marked a top in tech stocks that simply don\u2019t make any money, despite their size and disruptive power. Shares in any number of once-hot companies, like Lyft or Slack, have slumped. WeWork has, of course, cancelled its IPO, and seems to be bringing property prices in New York and London down with it.\n\nIt\u2019s only the beginning of what I suspect will be a long fall for Big Tech. From 2008 onwards, Silicon Valley took the place of Wall Street as the global hub of corporate wealth and power, creating the world\u2019s first trillion-dollar business, growing companies with more users than the planet\u2019s largest countries, and reshaping everything from our brains to our elections.\n\nBut just as finance faced an existential crisis a decade ago, so Big Tech is facing one now. The US-China trade and tech war is leading to a \u201csplinternet,\u201d which will make it much more difficult for digital giants to grow. There are calls from regulators and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic to clamp down on the size and power of the sector.\n\nI never made any money from those Antfactory shares. In fact, demoralised by listening to people try to make nothing sound like something, I left the company several months before it went bust. But I learnt a few things about bubbles along the way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRana Foroohar is the author of Don\u2019t Be Evil: The Case Against Big Tech (Allen Lane) which is published on November 5.\n\nBubble trouble: losers in the first dotcom crash\n\nPets.com\n\nPets.com ballooned from a tiny San Francisco-based start-up in August 1998 to a publicly traded company in February 2000, raising an impressive $US82 million at its IPO, before being put down nine months later due to a faulty business model that underestimated shipping costs and sold most of its goods at a fraction of cost. By November 2000, its stock had plummeted from a high of $US14 per share to a low of 22 cents. Thanks to its excessive marketing spend, which included commissioning a 36ft balloon version of its canine mascot at the 1999 Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Pets.com became the most publicised victim of the dotcom bubble.\n\nBoo.com\n\nIn an industry where timing is everything, Boo.com, Britain\u2019s first high-profile internet casualty, was arguably 10 years too early. Launched in the autumn of 1999 by Swedish poetry critic Ernst Malmsten and former model Kajsa Leander, Boo.com aspired to be the go-to site for sports fashion, replete with virtual shop assistant named \u201cMiss Boo\u201d. It secured investment from the likes of JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, and Fortune magazine proclaimed it one of Europe\u2019s coolest companies before it had sold a single item. Its ambition was immense \u2013 instead of launching in one country, it decided to start with 18 \u2013 but its customers\u2019 slow dial-up connections and its own lavish spending helped to derail the duo\u2019s ambitions. Boo.com burnt through $US135 million of venture capital in just 18 months and was liquidated in May 2000.\n\nKozmo\n\nFounded in New York in 1998 by young investment bankers Joseph Park and Yong Kang, Kozmo tapped into the irresistible business of instant gratification and was a harbinger of high-speed service unicorns Uber and Deliveroo. The company promised free one-hour delivery of games, DVDs, music, magazines, books, food and even cups of Starbucks coffee in several major cities in the US \u2013 for no delivery fee. Despite raising $US280 million in capital, and proving popular with college students and yuppies, the company buckled under the weight of its ambitious plans and expansion, failing to turn a profit and eventually closing in April 2001. In March 2018 it relaunched under new ownership with a more realistic focus on the bulk deliveries of groceries.\n\nMadeleine Pollard", "description": "In the late 1990s, pretty much anyone under 40 with loads of ambition wanted to be in the dotcom \"space\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_26%2C$y_98/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8dc7f32b5dccfe716134415aec9af85ee7b746a4", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
