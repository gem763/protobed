A primary theme: building relationships with customers who\u2019ll help you decide where to look for your next product.\n\n\u201cThe first product just has to work or else you\u2019re just not gonna have a company. But to be a big company, you have to have much more than just the product, it has to be the full experience and the full relationship that you have,\u201d says Kim. \u201cAnd then certainly you have to have the muscles on your team to be able to listen, evolve, test, and grow. So we\u2019re obviously searching for companies\u2026 where the founders know so much about their customer that for the first few years, you have a very clear line of, you know, path forward. It\u2019s not complicated. It\u2019s just execution. And that\u2019s hard to do. But you need to have a pulse on that customer.\u201d\n\nInstead of striving to meet the needs of every customer, entrepreneurs should focus on trying to understand the subscribers they\u2019ve zeroed in on by being purposeful \u2014 instead of throwing a bunch of ideas against the wall to see which ones stick.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s hard is your cash constraints. So you\u2019re starting with one or two products. It\u2019s not like an amazing experience, because it\u2019s one or two products,\u201d Kim said onstage. \u201cYou have to have like that laser-sharp product that is actually solving so much of the need that someone\u2019s like, \u2018well, it\u2019s only one product, but it\u2019s like a really good product. And so I\u2019m going to start there, I\u2019m going to trust Lola, and I\u2019ll get this tampon. And then if I like it, I\u2019m going to stick with it. I\u2019ll sign up for the subscription, because I do need it monthly. And then hey, maybe I\u2019ll buy something else.\u2019 And so the brand relationship builds over the course of time naturally.\u201d\n\nLola, which makes women\u2019s health products, launched with an organic cotton tampon that shipped to users monthly. After entering that space, the startup\u2019s co-founders strategized about how expand their offerings.\n\n\u201cWe figured, okay, there\u2019s this opportunity to build an end-to-end experience here,\u201d says Friedman. \u201cWhere do we start? Obviously, there are a lot of different categories and moments. So how can we be there for [our customer] at every stage with products and content and community. And so after period care, we went to sexual wellness, because that is very resonant with our current customer base.\u201d", "description": "The crowded world of subscription businesses offers ongoing opportunities to screw up your relationship with subscribers.
