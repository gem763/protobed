Scientists at NASA's headquarters in Greenbelt, Md., said that the change in temperatures leading to warmer air in the Arctic, which contributes to ozone gap shrinkage, was related to normal yearly phenomenon and not climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great news for ozone in the Southern Hemisphere,\u201d said Paul Newman, chief scientist for earth sciences at the facility. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to recognize that what we\u2019re seeing this year is due to warmer stratospheric temperatures. It\u2019s not a sign that atmospheric ozone is suddenly on a fast track to recovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis year, ozonesonde measurements at the South Pole did not show any portions of the atmosphere where ozone was completely depleted,\u201d added Bryan Johnson, an atmospheric scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Boulder, Colo., laboratory.\n\nScientists are hoping that the dangerous hole in the Earth's ozone layer, which contributes to increased negative effects from ultraviolet rays across the world, will dissipate following the decision to ban ozone-harming chemicals, some of which remain in the atmosphere, during the 1970s.\n\n--This report was updated on Oct. 22 at 7:39 a.m.", "description": "Scientists at NASA said Monday that the hole in the Earth's ozone layer has shrunk to the smallest size on record since it was first detected in the 1980s.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/reindeerarctic_073119getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
