Parts of nearby Miyagi prefecture were also under water.\n\nStudents and residents scoop dirt as the town is flooded due to Typhoon Hagibis, in Marumori, Miyagi prefecture, Japan (Kyodo News/AP)\n\nThe Tama River, which runs by Tokyo, overflowed its banks, flooding homes and other buildings in the area.\n\nAuthorities warned of a risk of mudslides. Among the reported deaths were those whose homes were buried in landslides. Other fatalities included people who got swept away by raging rivers.\n\nMr Suga said recovery was on its way. Some 376,000 homes were without electricity, and 14,000 homes lacked running water, he said.\n\nBoats as well as helicopters were sent to the flooded areas, while rescue crew dug through dirt elsewhere to try to get people out from homes buried by landslides.\n\nSeveral train services in the Tokyo area resumed, although others were undergoing safety checks and were expected to restart later on Sunday.\n\nBullet trains under water in Nagano, central Japan (Yohei Kanasashi/Kyodo News via AP)\n\nRuling party politician Fumio Kishida said the government will do its utmost in rescue operations, including making sure that those who moved to shelters were taken care of.\n\nHe acknowledged Japan\u2019s power grids need to be strengthened so people in disaster areas can rely on timely information.\n\n\u201cSo many risks remain, and it is a reality we must stay on guard,\u201d Mr Kishida said on an NHK TV news talk show. \u201cWe must do our utmost. In these times, a disaster can hit anytime.\u201d\n\nThe authorities had repeatedly warned Hagibis was on par with a typhoon that hit the Tokyo region in 1958.\n\nBut the safety infrastructure that Japan\u2019s modernisation had brought was apparent.
