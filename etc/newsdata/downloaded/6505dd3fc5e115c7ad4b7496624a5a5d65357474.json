Their mother called from the kitchen, \u201cMandisa, please go to the shop for me.\n\n\n\nHere is the shopping list.\u201d Mandisa read the shopping list, \u201cBread, margarine, peanut butter, apricot jam, flour, eggs, sugar, milk, tea, and salt.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll need two bags for all this.\u201d Nomsa hopped up and down. \u201cCan I come too? Please, can I come?\u201d She had some money saved.\n\n\n\nShe loved the big round orange sweets at the shop. \u201cDo you have to?\u201d Mandisa sighed. She was twelve and Nomsa was six and\n\n\n\nsometimes she got tired of her little sister tagging along behind her. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to help me carry the shopping then.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI will, I will!\u201d promised Nomsa. \u201cRead the list again, I want to hear what we have to get.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBread, margarine, peanut butter, apricot jam, flour, eggs, sugar, milk, tea, and salt,\u201d read Mandisa as Nomsa counted the items on her fingers.\n\n\n\nTen items, one for each finger. Nomsa could not read yet, but she was good at remembering things.\n\n\n\nThe sisters went out into the street. The wind was blowing! It flapped their clothes and it sent the litter in the street racing and tumbling around their feet.\n\n\n\nAs they passed the hair salon in Mrs Ngubane\u2019s garage they saw Fezeka and Phumla having their hair braided. Mrs. Ngubane was very clever at braiding.\n\n\n\nFezeka and Phumla were Mandisa\u2019s best friends. \u201cYoh, you look good!\u201d Mandisa said when she went into the hair salon to look at the new style in braiding.\n\n\n\nIt was very smart. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing a new shirt,\u201d Mandisa said to Fezeka. She bent over and felt the material between her fingers. \u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d\n\n\n\nNomsa sighed. She wanted to get to the shop quickly. But all Mandisa thought about these days was clothes and hair and shoes.\n\n\n\n\u201cI love your new necklace, Phumla!\u201d said Mandisa bending over to touch her friend\u2019s new necklace. Then, oh-oh!\n\n\n\nThe wind snatched the shopping list out of Mandisa\u2019s hand! It flew away over the wall, then over the roof next door. It was gone, gone, gone!\n\n\n\nAbsolutely and completely gone! \u201cNow I\u2019m in trouble,\u201d said Mandisa as she put her hand over her mouth.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to go home and ask Mama for a new list and she\u2019ll be cross!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to! I can remember the shopping list,\u201d said Nomsa hopping up and down. \u201cI can remember everything.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe held up her hands and counted the items on her ten fingers. Each finger was something from the shopping list.\n\n\n\n\u201cBread, margarine, peanut butter, apricot jam, flour, eggs, sugar, milk, tea, and salt!\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nMandisa looked surprised. \u201cWell done, Sisi! I\u2019m glad you came with me. Let\u2019s get to the shop quickly and buy those things.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, Mama is going to be cross.\u201dWhen they got to Mambhele Cash Store,\n\n\n\nMandisa asked for all the things that Nomsa had remembered on her ten fingers and she put the things in the shopping bags.\n\n\n\nNomsa stared at the big bottle of orange sweets and the bottle of jelly babies near the till. She took her money out and gave it to Mandisa.\n\n\n\nShe pointed at the sweets she wanted and Mandisa bought them. Mandisa added a red lollipop as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for saving me from getting into trouble,\u201d said Mandisa. \u201cI know you like red lollipops.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey each carried a shopping bag home and Nomsa sucked her red lollipop.\n\n\n\nAt home, they unpacked the shopping bags on the kitchen table and Mandisa asked, \u201cMama, can I make pancakes for supper tonight?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe knew Nomsa loved pancakes. \u201cYes,\u201d said their mother. \u201cI have a lot of school work to mark this afternoon. It would really help me if you made supper.\u201d\n\n\n\nTogether Nomsa and Mandisa mixed flour, eggs, milk, sugar and a little salt for pancakes. They let the mixture stand for an hour.\n\n\n\nThen they made pancakes and pancakes and more pancakes. The kitchen smelt so good! When Papa came home, he went straight to the kitchen.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy nose is telling me that we are having pancakes for supper! And I see that my two daughters are the cooks. What are you going to put inside them?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some mince left over from yesterday. We can use that,\u201d said Mandisa. \u201cAnd there\u2019s also apricot jam.\n\n\n\nApricot jam is my favourite in the whole world!\u201d said Nomsa hopping up and down. \u201cMine too,\u201d said Papa and he laughed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Mama came into the kitchen, she clapped her hands. \u201cWell done, my daughters!\u201d she said. The pancakes were delicious.\n\n\n\n\u201cI can remember the ingredients for the recipe,\u201d Nomsa said. She held up her hand and counted them on her five fingers, \u201cFlour, eggs, milk, sugar and a little salt!\u201d\n\n\n\nHer father laughed and patted her shoulder. \u201cMy clever little girl!\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I should use my fingers to remember things too!\u201d\n\nTo read the story in another language download a pdf document below:\n\n\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
