USA TODAY\n\nJulianne Hough and Brooks Laich revealed they're mourning the death of their two dogs in heartbreaking Instagram posts Saturday.\n\n\"Pure love is real, it existed through us,\" Hough, 31, wrote in a caption alongside several photos and videos of Lexi and Harley, two Cavalier King Charles Spaniels that died Sept. 28. Neither Hough nor Laich specified the nature of their deaths.\n\n\"My heart expanded and felt the truth of what is possible,\" Hough continued. \"I am forever grateful. Thank you for your love.\"\n\nLexi and Harley were born in 2008 and 2011, respectively. Hough brought them into the spotlight in 2013, when they joined her at a photo shoot for a Purina campaign to celebrate National Bring Your Pet to Work Day.\n\nJulianne Hough posed with dogs Lexi and Harley at a Purina campaign photo shoot in 2013.

Thank you for teaching me how to be your mother.\n\n\"Thank you for allowing me to give and receive love. Thank you for your kisses. Thank you for your blessings every single minute of every single day. Thank you for your souls. Thank you for protecting me. Thank you for letting me protect you. Thank you for protecting each other. Thank you for the timeless memories. Thank you for your magic.\"\n\nLaich, 36, also shared a post Saturday thanking family and friends for helping the couple \"grieve and mourn,\" and thanking Hough for \"allowing me to share in their world, and trusting me to be their dad.\" The couple got engaged in 2015 and married two years later.\n\n\"The past 2 weeks have been filled with tears of sorrow, and tears of joy,\" wrote Laich, a professional hockey player. \"The immense pain we feel by their loss is due to the overwhelming love we had for them. Every single beautiful part of them will be missed, but we trust that they are in a better place now, and can still feel their presence in our hearts.\"\n\nHough concluded: \"Thank you for being the most consistent and constant beings in my life. Thank you for being you. Thank you for being my guardians on this earth and even more so now. I\u2019ve never experienced a love like ours. I miss you. I love you forever. Now You Are Free.\"\n\n'Queer Eye' star Jonathan Van Ness mourns his cat that 'fell from an open window'\n\nBarbra Streisand mourns the death of her 'beloved' dog Samantha\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/13/julianne-hough-shares-heartbreaking-post-after-losing-her-two-dogs/3968747002/", "description": "\"My heart expanded ...
