Some Saudi officials said a return to normal will take longer.\n\nThe kingdom has restored 50% of production lost in Saturday\u2019s attacks, but won\u2019t restore its total capacity for a few months, Prince Abdulaziz said.\n\nSaudi Arabia hasn\u2019t directly accused Tehran of mounting the attacks, but the country is increasingly confident that Iran directly launched a complex missile and drone attack from its southwestern territory on Saturday that battered the kingdom\u2019s oil industry, said people familiar with the investigation.\n\nRelated Video Saturday\u2019s attack on a Saudi oil facility could have long-lasting repercussions.

But he also said the kingdom\u2019s cushion of production capacity\u2014which normally includes idle wells capable of pumping out two million barrels of crude a day\u2014won\u2019t be fully restored until the end of November.\n\nSome Saudi officials say restoration efforts will take even longer than the oil minister outlined Tuesday. \u201cThe damage is severe,\u201d a Saudi official familiar with the matter said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Prince Abdulaziz alluded to Iran\u2019s involvement in the attacks and a series of assaults in recent months on oil vessels in the Persian Gulf and infrastructure in the region. \u201cThis modus operandi has been escalated,\u201d he said.\n\nThe price of Brent crude\u2014the global benchmark\u2014jumped 15% to $69.02 a barrel on Monday, its largest one-day climb since 1988. It then fell back 6.5% to $64.55 a barrel on Tuesday.\n\nFor decades, oil markets have relied on the Saudi Arabia\u2019s output flexibility to turn on and off its spigots in times of global crisis. For at least the next 10 weeks or so, Saudi Arabia would likely be unable to step in to fill global supply gaps in the event of another disruption, foreign or domestic.\n\nSaudi Arabia expects its Abqaiq facility to return to pre-attack normal production levels of about 4.9 million barrels a day by the end of September, but it will take the kingdom until November to restore its full production capacity of 12 million barrels a day.\n\nThe destruction at Abqaiq oil-processing facility and Khurais oil field cut off roughly 5.7 million barrels a day in production, about half the country\u2019s total output and some 5% of global oil supply. The attacks came as the state-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co., also known as Aramco, prepares for a two-stage initial public offering. Aramco hopes to raise as much as $100 billion in the dual debut, which would make it the biggest IPO ever.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz, the son of King Salman, said the offering won\u2019t be affected by the attacks. The company had planned to debut on the Saudi stock market before the end of the year, The Wall Street Journal reported, and then float its shares on a yet-to-be-chosen international exchange sometime in 2020 or 2021.\n\nIn the same press conference on Tuesday, Aramco Chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan said the oil firm was committed to an IPO in the next 12 months.\n\nSaturday\u2019s assault was the largest-ever attack on Saudi oil infrastructure and now poses the biggest geopolitical and economic test for 34-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s day-to-day ruler. The royal has sought to wean his oil-dependent country off oil by introducing social and economic reforms, and the threat of conflict could upend those plans.\n\nAs Saudi officials review information coming in from the U.S., Kuwait and their own investigators, they are focusing on southern Iran, near Iraq, as the likely launchpad, the people said.\n\nThe drones and missiles appeared to have flown low to the ground, so that they weren\u2019t detected by Saudi radar or defense systems early on Saturday morning, according to the people familiar with the investigation.\n\nInvestigators have found debris that appears to be Iranian cruise missile technology, the people said.\n\n\u201cEverything points to them,\u201d said a Saudi official who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak to the media, referring to Iran. \u201cThe debris, the intel and the points of impact.\u201d\n\nIran has denied any involvement in the attacks in Saudi Arabia and in the Persian Gulf.\n\nAbqaiq is the world\u2019s biggest facility of its kind, with a maximum production capacity of 7 million barrels a day. It draws crude from the kingdom\u2019s massive oil fields and separates it from gas into specific grades, which are sold to customers largely in Asia, such as China, Japan and Korea.\n\nWith Abqaiq normally processing highly prized light crude, Aramco has asked buyers in India and China to load grades of lesser quality until at least early October, traders say. That has increased demand for light crudes to similar grades in the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, they said.\n\nThe loss in natural-gas liquids associated with crude has also diminished supplies of ethane, propane and butane sent to Saudi petrochemical company Sabic, said Saudi and European oil officials.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz was more bullish on Tuesday than Saudi officials have been in recent days. At least two of seven of Abqaiq\u2019s stabilization facilities were severely damaged and have to be rebuilt, which could take months, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.\n\nIn recent days, company officials have reached out to oil buyers, officials at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, analysts and consultants with an upbeat message: Any immediate shortfall can be covered by oil in storage, and normal supplies should be restored within three weeks.\n\nSome in the kingdom say they even see a silver lining in the incident. \u201cThe crisis can help the IPO,\u201d said a Saudi oil adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity for Aramco to show it can manage its supply chain well.\u201d\n\nThe adviser said the kingdom\u2019s pressing need to raise cash through the listing was a powerful incentive to avoid an escalation with Iran.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia doesn\u2019t want war with Iran because it wants to save the IPO. They can\u2019t have both,\u201d said the Saudi oil adviser.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman also needs the IPO to make up for $30 billion in losses from the Saudi sovereign fund, the adviser said.\n\nOne European oil executive who spoke to personal contacts at Aramco said he was told the repairs would take months. The executive said the repair efforts will require ordering made-to-measure equipment, which would need to be shipped from abroad and then tested.\n\nWrite to Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com, Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com", "description": "Saudi Arabia will soon restore most of its oil output and return to normal production levels in weeks, the country\u2019s energy ministry said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Rory Jones In Jeddah", "Summer Said In Dubai", "Benoit Faucon In London", "Rory Jones", "Summer Said", "Benoit Faucon", "Rory.Jones Wsj.Com", "Summer.Said Wsj.Com", "Benoit.Faucon Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107930/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
