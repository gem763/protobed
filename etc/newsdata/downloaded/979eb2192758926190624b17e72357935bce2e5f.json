During the Reagan administration, shortly after revelations of the Iran-Contra scandal, Congress created an inspector general at the CIA, precisely so an independent entity on the inside could facilitate oversight of secret operations gone rogue. The IG was required to meet with the House and Senate Intelligence Committees twice a year and, beyond that, to inform them immediately about any complaint. (The current intelligence community IG, a post created in 2010, inherited the same requirements.)\n\n\u201cThus,\u201d Johnson told me in an email, \u201cthe current whistleblower has the wind of law at his or her back.\u201d If the administration\u2019s arguments are right, then the whole purpose of an IG\u2014the whole purpose of independent oversight\u2014is called into question.\n\nYet the Trump administration has frequently invoked a very broad interpretation of the president\u2019s constitutional powers\u2014to declare a Muslim ban on travel to the United States, to declare a state of emergency to justify taking money from the Defense Department to fund construction of a wall on the Southern border (even when Congress has voted to forbid funding), and now to keep the House Intelligence Committee from getting information that it\u2019s entitled to get by law. (It\u2019s worth noting that the intel committees, which have long been entrusted with some of the government\u2019s deepest secrets, have almost never been responsible for leaks.)", "description": "", "authors": ["Fred Kaplan", "Slate.Com News-And-Politics Intelligence-Whistleblower-Trump-Dni-Ukraine.Html"], "top_image": ""}
