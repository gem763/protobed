North Korea wanted an Obama-era kind of deal and Trump has shown he won\u2019t give it to them.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban wanted the same thing. They wanted concessions, legitimacy and a U.S. exit in exchange for promises they won\u2019t allow groups like Islamic State and al Qaeda to continue to exist, even though they can\u2019t control those groups,\u201d he concluded.\n\nWith regard to North Korea, Mr. Trump walked away from his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in February, saying the terms just weren\u2019t right \u2014 that Mr. Kim was demanding sweeping sanctions relief for only a limited commitment to destroy part of his nuclear weapons arsenal.\n\nTalks with the North Koreans have essentially stalled since. But Mr. Trump has sought to keep the door open. He held a surprise handshake meeting with Mr. Kim on the border between North and South Korea in June, and then dispatched his North Korea envoy, Stephen Biegun, to offer working level talks \u2014 all while keeping sanctions pressure in place against Pyongyang.\n\nThe same approach appears likely to take shape with regard to the Taliban.\n\nMr. Trump has recalled his Afghanistan envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad and also asserted in a Saturday night tweet that if the Taliban \u201ccannot agree to a ceasefire \u2026 then they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway.\u201d\n\nBut the administration also appeared to keep the door open a tiny bit. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for instance, told CNN on Sunday that U.S. officials are \u201cgoing to keep driving\u201d toward a deal with the Taliban, although it will be up to the Afghan guerrilla group to decide whether talks can resume.\n\nThe catch, according to some analysts, is that Mr. Trump\u2019s approach puts his administration at risk of not having anything major to show in terms of foreign policy breakthroughs as it heads toward the end of its third year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to point to a major success from the method that Trump has used for his foreign policy and I don\u2019t see one coming around the corner,\u201d said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress.\n\n\u201cWhat we have is an unpredictable and disruptive style of foreign policy \u2026 in which Trump prides himself in making these reality-TV-show type of public revelations via Twitter that surprise some of America\u2019s closest partners to a point they increasingly feel like they can\u2019t rely on the United States,\u201d Mr. Katulis said in an interview.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s own foreign policy team that is actually involved in sensitive negotiations is also being undercut by his zigzags on policy, and things that he appears to even be making up via Twitter,\u201d he said.\n\nAt issue most recently was the president\u2019s revelation in a tweet Saturday night that he had secretly planned to allow Taliban leaders to visit Camp David for what could have been breakthrough summit with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.\n\nThe revelation, as well as the notion of allowing the Taliban to visit the presidential retreat where the U.S. campaign against the group was first planned in the wake of Sept. 11 terrorist attacks nearly 18 years ago, outraged some lawmakers from both parties.\n\n\u201cCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney, Wyoming Republican, tweeted. \u201cNo member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.\u201d\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, Illinois Republican and an Air Force veteran of the Afghanistan War, spoke similarly, saying the Taliban should not be \u201callowed in our great country. NEVER. Full stop.\u201d\n\nFrom the other side of the aisle Monday, Sen. Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters that while Mr. Trump is \u201cmore about the sizzle than the result,\u201d even his efforts at sizzle still result in legitimizing people whom the U.S. should not be legitimizing.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban, who were those gave refuge to Osama Bin Laden and the perpetrators of September 11th, should never be invited to Camp David, number one. There should not be a negotiation that provides for results for them, without a peace that comes before,\u201d he said.\n\nBut some conservative analysts have come to Mr. Trump\u2019s defense, asserting the president used the social media platform with skill to scorn the Taliban in real time on the international stage, while also showing the militants what might have been \u2014 or could still perhaps be \u2014 if they show more respect to his negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhat the tweets reflect is Trump trying to shape the negotiating environment,\u201d said James Carafano, a long-time analyst with the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cTrump does deals. He doesn\u2019t do bad deals. The fact is he\u2019s just not going to do a deal for the sake of a deal. Its not like Obama and Iran, with the \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll take any deal just to get a deal\u2019 approach,\u201d Mr. Carafano said in an interview. \u201cTrump is willing to take the criticism for holding the hard line, even if that means there is no deal. He\u2019s willing to own it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole Trumpian strategy is that he kind of leads with a stiff arm and then says, \u2018Look I\u2019m going to protect my interests.\u2019 This makes the other guy realize there\u2019s nothing to be gained by trying to undercut that, and then when the other guy says, \u2018OK, let\u2019s talk,\u2019 great. Our interests are protected.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s right out of the [Ronald] Reagan playbook,\u201d Mr. Carafano said, referring to the former Republican\u2019s president\u2019s success in negotiations with the former Soviet Union. \u201cReagan showed the Russians we mean business, and then we say, \u2018OK, let\u2019s talk.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe added that critics are going to pounce on Mr. Trump no matter what the president does.\n\n\u201cBefore, they would criticism him on grounds he might make a deal with the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans, saying he\u2019s going to make a deal just to make a deal,\u201d Mr. Carafano said. \u201cThen they criticize him for not making a deal. The criticisms are either blatantly partisan or incredibly superficial.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
