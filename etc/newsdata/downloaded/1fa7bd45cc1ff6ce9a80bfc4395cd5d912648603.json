Maybe it\u2019s time we started taking this whole \u201cclimate change\u201d thing seriously.\n\nThe first exoplanet with the potential to host life as we know it, meaning it was orbiting a star similar to the one we call \u2018the sun,\u2019 was discovered by Mayor and fellow Nobel winner Didier Queloz in 1995. In the time since, researchers have confirmed the existence of more than 4,000 exoplanets. But we won\u2019t be making the trip to any of them, says Mayor.\n\nHe told Agence France-Press:\n\nIf we are talking about exoplanets, things should be clear: we will not migrate there. These planets are much, much too far away. Even in the very optimistic case of a livable planet that is not too far, say a few dozen light years, which is not a lot, it\u2019s in the neighborhood, the time to go there is considerable. We are talking about hundreds of millions of days using the means we have available today.\n\nRather than concern ourselves with dreams of colonizing planets throughout our galaxy and beyond, Mayor says \u201cWe must take care of our planet.\u201d He told AFP that he wanted to dissuade people from thinking of migration as a viable solution to existential threats, telling reporters he felt the need to \u201ckill all the statements that say \u2018OK, we will go to a livable planet if one day life is not possible on earth.\u201d He went on to call such sentiments \u201ccompletely crazy.\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2019s right. The current space race may not be a direct response to climate crisis science, but it\u2019s turning out to be a fantastic distraction from the actual, scientifically proven catastrophe unfolding here on Earth.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be online picking out curtains for some future mansion we hope to live in one day while our studio apartment is burning down around us.\n\nBecause, if exoplanets are off the table (barring some far-future tech like quantum warping), then we don\u2019t really have any other options. The Moon? It\u2019s not big enough. Mars? Let\u2019s examine that one briefly.\n\nThe red planet is uninhabitable. Despite Elon Musk\u2019s assertion that \u2018nuking\u2019 it would kick-start the atmosphere, there\u2019s no current technology capable of \u201cterraforming\u201d it to make it livable. There\u2019s a reason why people haven\u2019t fled the crowded streets of New York, Paris, and Bangladesh to stretch their legs in the wide-open expanses of Antarctica. Because uninhabitable means you can\u2019t survive without accommodations that don\u2019t occur naturally. The challenge of surviving on Mars is almost infinitely more difficult than living on Earth\u2018s south pole.\n\nWhen we imagine these ventures, the ones where we send brave explorers off to carve out a new home for humanity (Battlestar Galactica anyone?), we\u2019re not thinking about the billions of \u2018regular people\u2018 who don\u2019t have \u2018the right stuff,\u2019 to survive in the harsher-than-anything-on-our-planet reality of space.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt we\u2019ll eventually set up small colonies on the Moon and Mars, but feeding and housing billions of people?\n\nIf we\u2019re trying to preserve the species, we need to fight the climate crisis head-on.
