A group of agitated student protesters went to biology professor Bret Weinstein\u2019s classroom and demanded his resignation. That protest had its genesis in an equity campaign at the school to which Weinstein had objected. Later the same afternoon, a larger group of student protesters gathered in the library for several hours to air their grievances. Filmmaker Benjamin Boyce had dubbed this \u201cthe struggle session\u201d in reference to the Chinese practice during Chairman Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution.\n\nNext, Boyce looked back at some of the foundational ideas which animated the struggle session, including the idea adopted from Professor Robin DiAngelo that any disagreement with the new agenda is proof it\u2019s necessary. We finally wrapped up the struggle session and moved on to a revealing discussion that happened shortly afterward where a student demanded Weinstein stop using \u201clogic and reasons and white forms of knowledge.\u201d\n\nHaving not had enough drama for one day, a group of protesters headed to the cafeteria where they tried to get a cook fired and demanded free meals for their trouble. Boyce then looked back at earlier Evergreen protests and showed how the concept of a \u201csafe space\u201d was foundational to them. Most recently we looked at how the state of Washington appears to be following in Evergreen\u2019s footsteps at the behest of Gov. Jay Inslee.\n\nAnd that brings us to episode 12 in which we are finally moving on to the next day. This episode opens with a phone call to then-Police Chief Stacy Brown offering her condolences for the behavior of students toward her the previous day. \u201cThey\u2019re out of control and until the college is willing to do something about it instead of catering to their demands it\u2019s just going to get worse and worse,\u201d Brown predicted. And it turns out she was absolutely right.\n\nAt a rally that afternoon, students handed out flyers depicting Brown dressed in an R-rated Klan outfit. A female student who had been asking protesters to let Weinstein speak the previous day has been co-opted to read a list of demands but she struggles with some of the words.\n\nHaving read the list, the students then occupy an administrative building and chant about \u201cracist teachers.\u201d The students, led by Jamil, then begin ordering deans and administrators into George Bridges\u2019 office so they can act immediately on the list of demands. \u201cI need five white folk right now to\u2026go down to the dean\u2019s office and make sure any deans that are down there\u2014drag their asses up here into George\u2019s office. Good?\u201d Jamil said.\n\nHere\u2019s episode 12:", "description": "\"They're out of control...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Stacy-Brown.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
