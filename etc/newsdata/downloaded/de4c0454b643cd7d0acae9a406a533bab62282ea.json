You\u2019re expected to know how to fix bumps, pains and boo-boos with no hesitation, even though (last time you checked) you didn\u2019t go to med school.\n\nBut for those times when you have zero freaking clue, that\u2019s where your child\u2019s paediatrician comes in. Of course, no one wants to be that parent who calls for minor issues, but you also don\u2019t want to write off something that\u2019s potentially a BFD. For the record, paediatricians say you should call if you\u2019re ever unsure what\u2019s going on \u2014 but especially when your child has one of these symptoms.\n\nThey\u2019re wheezing\n\n\u201cAlways call a doctor for wheezing,\u201d says paediatrician Dr Patricia Garcia. \u201cWheezing shouldn\u2019t be audible \u2014 it\u2019s something you should hear with a stethoscope. If the wheezing is so bad a parent can hear it, then a doctor needs to know right away.\u201d\n\nThey have a rash that\u2019s spreading\n\nRashes are tricky, and they don\u2019t always signal something serious. Often times if a rash is cause for concern it\u2019s accompanied by other symptoms says paediatrician Dr Gina Posner.\n\nThat being said, if your child has a rash that\u2019s spreading and it seems to be getting worse over time, it definitely warrants a call with or without other symptoms, says paediatrician Dr Ashanti Woods.\n\nREAD MORE: 11 Easy-To-Digest Foods For When Your Stomach Is Upset, According To A GI Doc\n\nThey have a burn\n\nAnything \u201cworse than a mild sunburn\u201d needs a check-in with your doctor, Dr Garcia says. In addition to treating the burn at that particular moment, your doctor can also advise you on after-care. \u201cIf there are blisters or if the burn is on the face, neck or chest, or it\u2019s over a large area, parents should seek immediate care,\u201d she says.\n\nThey have a fever and they\u2019re under three months old\n\nIt\u2019s \u201csafer\u201d to call the doctor with children who are this young, Dr Posner says. \u201cThe problem with fever in babies is a lot of times you can\u2019t tell the source because they\u2019re not going to tell you,\u201d she explains.\n\nWhen a child so young has a fever, it could be a clue to anything from a urinary infection to meningitis, Dr Posner says. So, calling your doctor can help speed up the process of figuring out what\u2019s going on and what next steps to take before it potentially gets more serious.\n\nThey have a fever that lasts for more than five days\n\nMany viruses will cause about three days of a fever, Dr Posner says, so five days of that hot temp is a sign that something is off. It\u2019s important to keep tabs on how your child feels as well, she says. If they\u2019re uncomfortable, call your doctor sooner to err on the side of caution and to provide them relief from pain.\n\nThey have unexplained weakness\n\nPaediatricians and parents are on high alert for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a polio-like virus. Unexplained weakness in your child doesn\u2019t automatically mean that they have AFM, but it\u2019s not a normal symptom and should be checked out, Dr Posner says.\n\nThey\u2019re vomiting with a fever\n\nThis could be due to a virus, or it could be a sign of a urinary infection, Dr Posner says. Either way, it\u2019s going to be tough for you to figure it out on your own.\n\nThey repeatedly have a fever over 40\n\nSome kids tend to run high fevers, Dr Posner says, but 40 is definitely up there. Having a fever this high in children between six months and six years puts them at an increased risk for a febrile seizure, which is a seizure that happens due to a persistently high fever, Dr Woods says. \u201cCall your doctor regardless about next steps,\u201d he adds.\n\nThey have persistent diarrhoea\n\nDiarrhoea that won\u2019t go away could be a sign of a food-borne infection like campylobacter or salmonella, Dr Posner says. Keep this in mind, per Dr Garcia: Your paediatrician will usually want to know what it looks like (is it liquid or does it have some consistency, like apple sauce or pudding?). You may even want to take photos (sorry!).\n\nThey\u2019re not breathing the way they normally do\n\nTrouble breathing is always something you want to call about, Dr Woods says.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to wake them up\n\nThis classifies as having an \u201caltered mental status,\u201d Dr Posner says, and it\u2019s not something you want to mess with. Call your doctor if your child seems unusually groggy.\n\nThey can\u2019t keep fluids down\n\nDehydration is the big concern. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take too long for a child to become dehydrated, and the younger the child is, the faster they become dehydrated,\u201d Dr Garcia says.\n\nA doctor can always hydrate them with intravenous fluids if it\u2019s a dire situation.\n\nREAD MORE: Does A Salt Water Gargle Do Anything For A Sore Throat, Or Nah?\n\nThey\u2019re under three months and have a cold\n\nNasal congestion can cause trouble eating in babies. \u201cI always remind parents that you can\u2019t effectively blow your nose until you\u2019re about three to four years old,\u201d Dr Garcia says. \u201cBecause babies have to breathe through their noses in order to eat, if their nose is blocked from congestion and/or mucus, then they can\u2019t eat.\u201d Your doctor will be able to advise you on how to de-stuff your baby.\n\nThey have ear pain that doesn\u2019t go away\n\nAlways call for this one. \u201cThis can be an ear infection or swimmer\u2019s ear, or even a foreign body [lodged in the ear],\u201d Dr Garcia says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots of small objects in ears and the only complaint the child had was ear pain. Most of the time, the child couldn\u2019t remember putting anything in their ear.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve had a runny nose for two weeks\n\nRunny and stuffy noses can stick around for a while, but they should start to clear up after a few weeks. \u201cIf it\u2019s not improving after two weeks, it\u2019s worth checking in,\u201d Dr Posner says.\n\nThey have a painful rash\n\n\u201cVery few rashes are actually painful unless there is an infection,\u201d Dr Garcia says. If your child tells you their rash hurts, call your doctor ASAP. It could even be a sign of chickenpox or shingles, Dr Posner adds.\n\nThey have a bruise-like rash\n\nA rash can be due to a lot of different things, but if it\u2019s purple and bruise-like, it could be a sign of meningitis, Dr Posner says. Call your doctor ASAP.\n\nIt hurts to pee\n\nThis can be a sign of a urinary tract infection, says Dr Posner. A UTI usually doesn\u2019t clear up without antibiotics, so you\u2019ll definitely need your doctor\u2019s help.\n\nThey have a deep cut, or one that won\u2019t stop bleeding\n\nA normal cut should stop bleeding after you apply pressure for five minutes, Dr Garcia says. But, if you\u2019re not sure whether the cut is bad or deep enough to warrant stitches, call your doctor anyway.\n\nThey have severe throat pain\n\nYou \u201calways\u201d want to check in with your doctor about this, Dr Garcia says. It could be a sign of strep throat, mononucleosis or another infection and may require a course of medication.\n\nThey have bloody pee\n\nThis could be a sign of a UTI, or even a strep infection, Dr Posner says. Either way, it\u2019s not normal and you\u2019ll want to talk to your paediatrician about your child\u2019s other symptoms.\n\nThey have bloody diarrhoea\n\n\u201cIf you see blood in your child\u2019s stool, call your doctor and please take some pictures before flushing,\u201d Dr Garcia says. \u201cBlood in stool can mean lots of things and knowing what it looks like can make a huge difference.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind, too, that there are lots of things that can make your kid\u2019s poop look red, including food dyes. So there\u2019s a chance that reddish poop is nothing to worry about, but it never hurts to check with an MD.\n\nREAD MORE: Does Taking Zinc Actually Do Anything To Help Kick A Cold?\n\nThey have a fever after being in the heat\n\nThis could be a sign of heat stroke or heat illness, which \u201ccan happen at any age,\u201d Dr. Garcia says. Call the doctor for next steps.\n\nAnother important thing: Don\u2019t do anything like putting your child in a cold bath or applying ice without talking to a doctor. \u201cAlthough a cold bath/ice may sound like a good idea, it can actually make things worse,\u201d Dr. Garcia says.\n\nThey have a severe headache\n\nIf your child complains of a headache, try ibuprofen, Dr. Posner says. But if it still persists, you\u2019ll want to call the doctor\u2014especially if your child has a fever, neck pain, vision changes, complains that light or sound bothers them, or if they have any unusual weakness, tingling, or numbness, Dr. Garcia says.\n\nThey have ear discharge\n\nThere could be a few things at play here, Dr. Garcia says. It could be a sign of an infection, or it could be a sign that your child has shoved something in there that\u2019s been hanging out in their ear for a long time.\n\nThey have red, swollen eyes\n\n\u201cThis can be from any number of things,\u201d Dr. Posner says. It could be due to allergies, a scratch, a virus, or a bacterial infection. Whatever the cause, you\u2019ll want to talk to your child\u2019s doctor about their other symptoms and next steps.\n\nThey have a sudden sensitivity to light\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a new symptom, you\u2019ll want to get it checked,\u201d Dr. Posner says. Sensitivity to light can be a sign of a slew of health issues, including allergies, but your doctor will want to know about this one and more to rule out a more serious condition.\n\nThey have pain around their belly button\n\n\u201cWhile this can be a stomach virus or just indigestion, sometimes pain around the belly button can be the start of something more serious like appendicitis,\u201d Dr. Garcia says. \u201cEarly on appendicitis pain is actually around the belly button. It is only later that it moves to the lower ride sight of the stomach.\u201d\n\nThey have back pain and a fever\n\nThese can be symptoms of a UTI, Dr. Garcia says. But they can also be a tip-off that your child is struggling with pneumonia, Dr. Posner says. You\u2019ll definitely want to make the call.\n\nThey have discoloured or cloudy pee\n\nDiscoloured or cloudy urine on its own could be a sign of dehydration, Dr. Posner says. But it can also be a sign of a UTI. If your child\u2019s urine doesn\u2019t change colour after drinking more liquids, or if they have pain along with their unusual pee, call the doctor.\n\nThey have diarrhoea that\u2019s streaked with mucus\n\nMucus in your child\u2019s diarrhoea could be a sign of a bacterial infection, Dr. Posner says\u2014and that will need treatment. Call your doctor, and snap pics beforehand, if you can.\n\nThey have unusual vaginal discharge\n\nIf it\u2019s thick and white, brown, or discoloured, or it smells bad, you\u2019ll want to check in, Dr. Posner says. Depending on your child\u2019s age, it can be a slew of different things (i.e., a yeast infection)\u2014and your doctor will want to know more.\n\nREAD MORE: 10 Signs You\u2019re Suffering From Mid-Year Burnout\n\nThey have penile discharge\n\nThis can be a sign of an infection, Dr. Posner says. Uncircumcised boys are more likely to get an infection of the foreskin, she notes.\n\nTheir cut or scrape is oozing\n\nA cut or scrape that oozes pus, one that feels hot or tender, or looks red or swollen should \u201calways\u201d be checked out, Dr. Garcia says, adding that \u201cthese are signs of infection.\u201d\n\nThey suddenly develop blisters\n\n\u201cWith declining vaccine rates, it could be a lot of things, some of which are more dangerous than others,\u201d Dr. Garcia says. \u201cParents should always call for this as soon as possible.\u201d It\u2019s also helpful to take pictures in this case because blisters can change, even over a few hours, she says.\n\nThey\u2019re peeing a lot\n\nThis could be a symptom of a UTI\u2026 or it could be a sign of diabetes, Dr. Posner says.\n\nIt looks like their ribcage is pulling in\n\nWhen some children have trouble breathing, it can look like \u201cpulling\u201d along the ribcage, Dr. Garcia says. \u201cYou might see the bottom of the rib cage or the space between the ribs when your child breathes in.\u201d This is a sign of trouble breathing and you should call your doctor right away.\n\nThey have soda-coloured pee\n\nPee that\u2019s darkly coloured like soda isn\u2019t normal. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely a sign of something being wrong,\u201d Dr. Garcia says. This typically means that there\u2019s blood in their urine (it looks brown because it\u2019s older), she says.\n\nThey\u2019re suddenly wetting the bed a lot\n\nIf your child starts having accidents out of nowhere, call the doctor. \u201cIt could be a sign of urinary tract infection,\u201d Dr. Garcia says.\n\nThey make a whistling sound when they breathe\n\nA high-pitched, whistling sound when your child breathes in is called stridor. You\u2019ll want to call your doctor ASAP if this is happening\u2014it\u2019s a sign they\u2019re having trouble breathing.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "No, you're not being dramatic if you dial the doc for these reasons.", "authors": ["Korin Miller"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9330/7151634576b64f979a5eb8e6a51c7000.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
