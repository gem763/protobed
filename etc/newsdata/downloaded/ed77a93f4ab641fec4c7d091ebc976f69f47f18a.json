At the forefront of the so-called global \u201csex recession\u201d is Japan, which has one of the lowest fertility rates on Earth, and it could serve as a cautionary tale for the U.S. and other industrialized countries. \u2026 A review of Japan\u2019s National Fertility Survey reveals virginity is on the rise; one out of every 10 Japanese men in their 30s is still a virgin. That puts Japan\u2019s virginity rate well ahead of that of other industrialized nations. \u201cA large proportion of these individuals cannot find a partner in the market,\u201d Peter Ueda, a public health researcher at Tokyo University, told CBS News. He\u2019s sounding the alarm about Japan\u2019s surging virginity rate, which he notes is, \u201cactually the highest ever recorded in a high-income country.\u201d For Japan, already well into an unprecedented population decline, the sex drought is more bad news. If current trends hold, Japan\u2019s population will collapse by more than half over the next century. The drop in both sex and births is often blamed are long working hours, too much time spent online, and the Japanese fetish for digital companionship, which manifests itself in the popularity of robots and holographic \u201cpartners.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s hit the pedantic point first. Perhaps I\u2019m just a little too literal, but how can virginity be surging or \u201con the rise\u201d? Virginity is the universal origin state from which change occurs, not a status that one later chooses. That might apply to celibacy, which can be adopted before or after sexual activity, but not virginity. Virginity is never actually \u201con the rise\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s just that its decline has slowed.\n\nFurthermore, CBS is conflating two different issues. It was not all that long ago that the societal norm was to postpone sexual activity for marriage, even if the norm was not universally observed at all times. We didn\u2019t fret about too little premarital sex and too much virginity back in those days, and yet that norm produced significant fertility booms, most recently and famously after World War II. Oddly, the later expectation of early and constant sexual activity regardless of marital status, combined with the contraceptive culture that enables it, has produced fertility shortages.\n\nIt\u2019s the fertility crisis that\u2019s the issue, not the lack of sexual activity. So what\u2019s causing the fertility crisis? CBS focuses on a lack of job prospects and economic growth in both Japan and other industrialized nations, but the quality of life in these countries is better than ever. We have more access to luxuries and information than any other generation that preceded us. We live in larger spaces than ever. Rather than delay gratification to produce families, we tell ourselves \u2014 as one Japanese man does in the above video \u2014 that he doesn\u2019t earn enough money to support a wife and family. That\u2019s a choice, not an economic imperative.\n\nAs my friend Peter Grandich often points out, the boom in storage spaces underscores a rabid consumerism that leaves us focused on ourselves, rather than on building families. We want things, not children. Couldn\u2019t that be part of a fertility crisis?\n\nThere may well be other factors, too. We have teenagers running around the world convinced that the Earth is melting down and they\u2019ll all be dead in 12 years. What are we doing in response to this mass paranoid hysteria? We\u2019re handing out awards for best performance, that\u2019s what. That\u2019s not exactly an incentive to invest in the future, is it?", "description": "Cautionary tale?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cbs-sex-japan.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
