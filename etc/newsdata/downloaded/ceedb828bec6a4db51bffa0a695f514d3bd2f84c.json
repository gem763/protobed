FutureAsia, like the rest of Labor's policies, sits on a shelf somewhere, its future uncertain.\n\nFirst port of call\n\nNot to be discouraged, Anthony Albanese made Indonesia his first overseas port of call after he became leader. He visited Jakarta in August in the knowledge he would soon be accompanying Scott Morrison to East Timor to mark that nation's 20th anniversary of independence.\n\nIt would have been deemed impolitic had he visited Timor before Indonesia.\n\n\"Today I chose to make my first visit, as the Labor leader, to a foreign country right here in Indonesia,'' Albanese said upon arrival in Jakarta.\n\n\"Just as when I was sworn in as a minister in 2007, my first visit was to Indonesia. That is to underline the importance of the relationship between Australia and our northern neighbour.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking all this into consideration, anyone with half an ounce of wit could have deduced that Labor, win or lose the election, was not going to stand in the way of the free trade agreement the Coalition had negotiated with Indonesia, as well as those with Peru and Hong Kong.\n\nEnabling legislation for the three FTAs passed the House of Representatives this week with Labor's support and the same will happen in the Senate when it sits next month.\n\nBefore the election, Labor came under pressure from sections of the trade union movement and the Left to take a harder line on FTAs, namely the provision that supposedly allows the entry of hordes of foreign workers without labour market testing, and the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement clauses.\n\nLabor, had it won, would have been under pressure to renegotiate or amend these components of the FTAs but the deals would have still been ratified, come what may.\n\nBowen, for one, would have ensured it, so would have Penny Wong. There would have been some niggle from the unions but Bill Shorten would have sorted that with a handful of concessions, not dissimilar to those Albanese secured from the government this week.\n\nShorten may have had his flaws as leader but his ability to keep the unions in check, an important attribute for any Labor leader, was a key strength.\n\nTest of leadership\n\nAnthony Albanese is not a union man per se and the spirited fight sections of the industrial left mounted against Labor's support for the FTAs appeared to be as much about testing him as it was about genuinely held concerns for provisions in the FTAs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a mistake to conclude the unions were angry at Labor's decision. The most vocal was the Electrical Trades Union which has at times disaffiliated with Labor and sided with the Greens who opposed to the FTAs.\n\nThe other chief critic was ACTU president Michele O'Neil, who hails from the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Union, which saw its members' jobs wiped out by cheap overseas imports aided by tariff cuts.\n\nBeyond a sharp rebuke from the CFMMEU's Michael O'Connor, there was pretty much public silence from the rest of the movement.\n\nThat was because other unions saws jobs and opportunities in removing trade barriers with Indonesia. It was no coincidence that Albanese and shadow trade minster Madeleine King emphasised an expected boom in steel jobs in Port Kembla.\n\nAs Albanese pointed out, the Indonesian government has given the go ahead to build a new capital city.\n\nWhile the FTA may have had some hairs on it, on a net basis economic, supporting it was a no-brainer.\n\n\"There are a lot of 55-45 calls in this job but this was not one of those, it was a good outcome,'' he told caucus on Tuesday.\n\nNew focus on jobs\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupporting the FTAs has guaranteed him some vocal enemies among the party's socialist Left.\n\nSo, too, has securing the expulsion form the ALP of bovver boy John Setka, which was a clear and important victory for his fledgling leadership. Those contending otherwise need only consider the implications had Setka proved unmovable. Albanese's authority would have been severely diminished.\n\nGetting rid of Setka was not an anti-union gesture, it was because Albanese did not want Setka in his party.\n\nSimilarly, his position on the FTAs was not about trying to sideline unions.\n\nOne reason Labor lost the election was because of jobs. While it spoke about jobs, its policies were not sufficiently geared towards creating them.\n\nAs he and others in Labor now openly admit, Labor needs to embrace an agenda that extends beyond revenue raising and redistribution, towards one that grows productivity and creates jobs.\n\nHe will underline this next week with his first in a series of three headland speeches designed to reset policy direction.\n\nIts theme will be jobs and the future of work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"That's a very conscious decision that Labor's first priority is about employment, about jobs and about good-quality jobs,'' he said this week in forecasting the speech.\n\n\"We're putting down those markers. It is a signal of what our priorities would be in government, and what our priorities are in terms of policy development.\"\n\nLabor was never, ever going to oppose the legislation to enable the free trade deals with Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru.
