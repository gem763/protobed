I would never begrudge Alexis Sanchez getting \u00a3600,000 a week because without the players there is no game.\n\n'If you are not enhancing the lives of the athletes something is wrong. It is still seen as an amateur sport by those who run it but they are happy to take a nice wage and cheque, getting fat off the proceeds.'\n\nSprint sensation Asher-Smith said this week she was 'jealous' of new rules for US athletes\n\nOn Wednesday, leading sports marketing adviser Tim Crow told Sportsmail he knew of brands that had not got involved with Olympic athletes due to the restrictions of Rule 40.\n\n'Any relaxation of Rule 40 enhances every athlete's earning potential,' said Crow.\n\n'Over the passage of time everybody has realised that it is better to give athletes more room to manoeuvre when it comes to their personal sponsors because most of them really struggle.\n\n'If the rules are relaxed it will mean that perhaps more sponsors come to the table, because there is no doubt that Rule 40 has put off potential personal sponsors in the past. I have had personal experience of brands not getting involved with personal sponsorship of athletes around the Olympics because of Rule 40.'\n\nOn Asher-Smith's earning power after her world 200m gold and two silvers, he said: 'She is going to be an extremely hot property. She has got the most to gain, she is absolutely at the peak of her powers.'\n\nThe BOA said safeguards would need to be retained within a revised Rule 40 to prevent ambush marketing and protect lucrative official sponsorship deals. A spokesman said: 'The BOA has always taken a common sense approach to the application of the rule and will continue to do so for the benefit of all, whilst recognising our unique funding position.'", "description": "The earning potential of Team GB stars could dramatically increase before Tokyo 2020 if the British Olympic Association gets approval to relax 'stifling' sponsorship rules.", "authors": ["Laura Lambert For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/21/19506916-0-image-a-9_1570651310244.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
