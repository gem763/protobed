'For me personally, I've got to get myself back to that level before discussing (team) leadership, but at least we're optimistic.'\n\nFroome missed last July's Tour due to his injuries and watched from home as Bernal and 2018 champion, Geraint Thomas, took first and second place overall at the Tour's finish in Paris. Now Froome is back in training and although 35 next summer, will aim to take a fifth Tour win ahead of his prodigious Colombian team mate, who is 12 years his junior.\n\n'I'm doing much better,' Froome said. 'I'm on the road to recovery still, I've made it back onto the bike in the last month which has been fantastic. I'm still a little bit shaky on my feet but I'm heading in the right direction.\n\n'I've got a plate on my hip that I need to get removed soon, and once that comes off hopefully things will start to improve a little bit faster.'\n\nYoung Colombian rider Egan Bernal, also of Team Ineos, was crowned the 2019 Tour winner\n\nThe 2020 Tour starts on June 27 in Nice, close to Froome's home in Monaco, and includes major mountain passes from the very start.\n\n'The course for next year is brutal, probably the hardest route I've seen for the last five or six years,' Froome said.\n\n'Starting on roads that we are really familiar with around Nice is fantastic for us and the team. It should be a really exciting Tour, with a sting in the tail with the 36 kilometre time trial at la Planchedes Belles Filles. We haven't seen anything like that for decades.'", "description": "Chris Froome's comeback from career-threatening injuries gathered pace in Paris as the four-time Tour de France winner targeted victory in next year's race.", "authors": ["Chris Murphy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/23/19761442-0-image-a-70_1571177187000.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
