Sala was traveling to Cardiff from Nantes to complete the 15 million-pound (about $20 million) transfer that the clubs had agreed to two days earlier.\n\nCardiff said it is \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d at the FIFA ruling announced on Monday - which also suggested Cardiff could also be liable for subsequent payments to Nantes - and would be appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\n\u201cIt would appear the committee has reached its conclusion on a narrow aspect of the overall dispute, without considering the full documentation presented by Cardiff to FIFA,\u201d Cardiff said in a statement released Wednesday.\n\n\u201cNevertheless there remains clear evidence that the transfer agreement was never completed in accordance with multiple contractual requirements which were requested by Nantes, thereby rendering (it) null and void.\u201d\n\nCardiff, which was in the English Premier League at the time of Sala\u2019s death but now plays in the second-tier Championship, said the \u201congoing civil and criminal considerations both in the UK and abroad\u201d also will likely have an impact on the validity of the transfer.\n\nSala was travelling in a single-engine aircraft with a pilot, David Ibbotson, when it lost contact with Air Traffic Control. The body of the 28-year-old Sala was recovered from the wreckage two weeks later. Ibbotson\u2019s body has not been found.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer nd https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cardiff will appeal to sport's highest court against FIFA's ruling that the club should pay 6 million euros ($6.5 million) to Nantes as a first installment of the transfer fee for the late Argentine striker Emiliano Sala.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/soccer_fifa_sala_claim_41181_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e"}
