He only needs 34 to save him from being convicted and removed from office if the House impeaches him.\n\nSo if Mitt Romney or Ben Sasse feel like voting to convict, they can and it wouldn\u2019t make a difference.\n\nThe red wall doesn\u2019t include Susan Collins or Cory Gardner, the two Republican senators from states that voted for Hillary Clinton (Maine and Colorado). Both are up for re-election next year.\n\nThey could vote to convict too, and it still wouldn\u2019t matter.\n\nRemember that impeachment, which only takes a majority vote in the House, doesn\u2019t end Trump\u2019s presidency. That only happens if two thirds of the Senate votes to convict and remove him \u2014 67 senators if they all show up.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
