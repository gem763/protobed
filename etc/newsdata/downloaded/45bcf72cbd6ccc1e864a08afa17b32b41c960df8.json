The bill would initiate a national task force to track those illegally selling firearms and those attempting to purchase firearms with false statements in their background checks.\n\nHouse Democrats pushed gun legislation to the Senate after these shootings, but gun reform has taken a back seat as the impeachment inquiry and foreign policy in Syria has been at the forefront on Capitol Hill.", "description": "Sen.
