Froome said the \u201closer buys the beer\u201d.\n\nAfter South Africa won the match 19-16, to set up a meeting with England in the final next Saturday, Froome tweeted \u201cBeers on me\u201d with a photo of the two cyclists raising beers.\n\nIn the criterium, Arashiro won a gala-style race run over 17 3.5km fan-packed laps of tight city streets, Bernal was second and world No.1 Primoz Roglic third, a metre or so adrift.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the first Japanese rider to win so maybe they\u2019ll talk about me in 20-years. So happy. Really special,\u201d said the seven-time Tour de France competitor.\n\nBernal said he was looking forward to visiting more of Japan with his entourage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen Tokyo and we\u2019ll be moving on to Kyoto for three days now,\u201d Bernal told AFP.\n\nThe 22-year-old Colombian said he had no space in his already bulging luggage for the large bags of local rice being given out as part of the prizes.\n\n\u2013 Next stop Olympics \u2013\n\nAlso present at the race was Tour de France king of the mountains Romain Bardet, and his polka-dot jersey raised a cheer over the early laps as he made a point of charging ahead on the one notable incline.\n\n\u201cWe had fun,\u201d said Bardet.\n\n\u201cWe fly home tonight but I hope to be back for the Olympics in July.\u201d\n\n\u201cI rode the final part of the Olympic route, it\u2019s a good technical descent and we\u2019re looking forwards to it. There will be five of us on the French team.\u201d\n\nWinner of the green sprint jersey here, Italian puncher Matteo Trentin is still smarting after settling for silver at the recent world championships in Yorkshire.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just about getting over the disappointment,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u201cThe rain there was ridiculous, I\u2019m only just warming up,\u201d he said with a straight face.", "description": "Saitama (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome successfully completed his first competitive ride since his horror crash in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/a9d9d8_chris-froome-rode-short-2km-team-time-trial-saitama-criterium-sunday-his-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
