The announcement was made hours after the group, which operates 20 charter schools in California, was hit with its fourth bombshell lawsuit in two months\n\nSources close to the situation have told DailyMail.com that lawyers for the alleged victims fear Green Dot is now trying to 'cover up' its mistakes by deleting incriminating evidence\n\nA boy's mother at the Green Dot Animo Westside school in Venice Beach filed a lawsuit in August claiming her sixth-grader son suffered permanent brain damage after being grabbed by the neck and punched by a fellow pupil in full view of staff last year.\n\nTwo weeks later the family of a 13-year-old girl at the school sued Green Dot alleging she was subjected to a year-long bullying campaign that drove her to attempt suicide.\n\nBoth suits were brought by prominent Los Angeles law firm Geragos & Geragos, known for high profile and celebrity court cases.\n\nJust hours after the fourth lawsuit dropped, the organization's CEO Cristina de Jesus (pictured) sent a memo to staff informing them of a 'newly adopted Document Retention and Destruction Policy\n\nAn 18-year-old woman then filed a third lawsuit that month claiming that when she was a freshman in 2015 she was cornered in the girls bathroom at Animo Westside and sexually assaulted by two boys.\n\nAnd on Monday Green Dot was hit with a fourth legal claim by a staff member at Animo Inglewood, who alleges her male colleague continually sexually harassed her and other women in the office and verbally abused female students.\n\nSchool operations manager Angelica Paz alleges office assistant Princewell Obinma was investigated by Green Dot after complaints by at least three women, and was recommended for dismissal. But she claims the school did not fire him, and instead forced his alleged victims to work just a few feet from him.\n\nJust hours after the fourth lawsuit dropped, the organization's CEO Cristina de Jesus sent a memo to staff informing them of a 'newly adopted Document Retention and Destruction Policy' which 'outlines protocol for retaining institutionally important documents and purging unimportant ones'.\n\nThe memo, obtained by DailyMail.com, has left Green Dot's legal opponents worried that the organization is purposely deleting emails which could be relevant to their cases as part of a 'cover up'.\n\nA boy's mother at the Green Dot Animo Westside school in Venice Beach (pictured) filed a lawsuit in August claiming her sixth-grader son suffered permanent brain damage after being grabbed by the neck and punched by a fellow pupil in full view of staff last year\n\nThe boy is seen being pushed up against a wall in CCTV footage of the attack as three students surround him (far right). The suit alleges that the 12-year-old boy was 'punched in the stomach, grabbed by the neck and then strangled' before he eventually lost consciousness. The incident was captured in shocking security footage\n\nIn an email sent to staff on Monday evening, De Jesus said Green Dot would 'no longer retain deleted email records on our server beyond 12 months' and the organization would 'begin to enact the policy within the next two weeks'.\n\n'Deleted items from Outlook are stored with our Barracuda Archiver and Backup for 12 months before being completely purged from our server, per the new policy,' she wrote.\n\n'An organization of our size and maturity is overdue for such a policy, and the policy is aligned to industry standard practice.'\n\nDe Jesus and her non-profit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGreen Dot, which was founded in 1999, has long been championed by the billionaire Gates family, which has handed millions of dollars to the organization through its charitable foundation.\n\nBack in 2007, the Gates Foundation poured $7.8 million into Green Dot in order to establish 10 new schools in Los Angeles, including Animo Westside \u2013 the subject of three of the four new lawsuits.\n\nBill and Melinda Gates are not being sued by any of the plaintiffs, nor is The Gates Foundation, however it is specifically mentioned in one of the legal complaints.\n\nThe suit claiming a boy was strangled causing him brain damage states that 'the Gates foundation has publicly touted Green Dot as a paradigm for school safety and efficiency'.\n\nBut despite the lauded safety of the school, the sixth-grade student was violently attacked by a classmate while in full view of a staff member, and teachers failed to call medical services for the boy for 20 minutes, his mother claims in court documents.\n\nThe suit alleges that the 12-year-old boy was 'punched in the stomach, grabbed by the neck and then strangled' before he eventually lost consciousness. The incident was captured in shocking security footage.\n\nIn court documents, the boy's mother, referred to only as Sara J, claims that a nearby school employee not only failed to stop the assault, but also 'failed to administer CPR and notify emergency services properly'.\n\nThe suit claiming a boy was strangled causing him brain damage states that 'the Gates foundation has publicly touted Green Dot as a paradigm for school safety and efficiency'\n\nThe student was then brought into a reception area where he is seen laying on the floor (left, in khaki pants). According to the lawsuit, it took the school 20 minutes after the attack to alert medical services\n\nThe video of the incident appears to show a staff member walking past the scuffle without intervening.\n\nAccording to the papers filed in a Los Angeles court, 'approximately 20 minutes passed from the moment the boy was strangled to the time emergency services were notified'.\n\nThe boy was 'in and out of consciousness and also exhibited signs of what seemed to be a seizure' before an ambulance was called, the legal papers said.\n\nThe mother believes that time period may have been crucial in rendering medical assistance, as the boy now reportedly suffers permanent brain damage as a result of the attack.\n\nThe suit claims the 12-year-old 'has struggled with his academics following the assault, and has been diagnosed with several learning disabilities' .\n\nIt also alleged that the perpetrator of the attack had a history of violence towards others at the school, and that his presence at Animo Westside was a danger to 'safety and security'.\n\nThe mother of the attacked boy asked the school to expel the perpetrator, but he was not removed from the school, according to the lawsuit. She is seeking an unspecified amount of money in damages.\n\nThe mother's lawyer, Ben Meiselas of Geragos & Geragos, filed a second suit two weeks later, this time on behalf of a 13-year-old girl whose family say she was driven to attempt suicide after a year of bullying that the school failed to tackle.\n\nMeiselas told DailyMail.com of Green Dot's latest conduct: 'Sadly, this is the fox guarding the henhouse. Not only has Green Dot utterly failed in its most basic duty of protecting children, it now appears to be engaged in a complete cover up. We will leave no stone unturned in holding Green Dot accountable for its despicable behavior.'", "description": "Green Dot Public Schools, funded by\u00a0Bill and Melinda Gates, introduced\u00a0a new policy of deleting internal emails on Monday after being hit with suits.
