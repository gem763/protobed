Col. Alexander Vindman, Trump's top National Security Council adviser on Ukraine, that had Democrats questioning Sondland's testimony most pointedly.\n\nSondland testified that \u201cneither Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, nor anyone else in the NSC staff ever expressed any concerns to me about our efforts \u2026 or any concerns that we were acting improperly,\u201d referring to former national security adviser John Bolton and former NSC senior Russia director Fiona Hill, who gave her own testimony last week.\n\nSondland added that if Bolton, Hill, \u201cor any others harbored misgivings about the propriety of what we were doing, they never shared those misgivings with me, then or later.\u201d\n\nAccording to Vindman, that is not true. In his opening statement, Vindman wrote that he and Hill confronted Sondland on July 10 after a meeting with Ukraine's top national security official. And, according to Hill and Vindman, Bolton abruptly ended a meeting with Ukraine\u2019s top national security official, Oleksandr Danylyuk, because he was disturbed about Sondland\u2019s comments.\n\nVindman said he and Hill subsequently accused Sondland of \"inappropriate\" remarks to the Ukrainians that seemed to condition a potential White House visit for Zelensky on a promise to open Trump's desired investigations.\n\n\u201cI stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push,\" Vindman told lawmakers, according to his statement. He noted that he took his concerns to the NSC's top lawyer after the meeting.\n\nHill testified earlier this month that she met with NSC lawyer John Eisenberg twice, at Bolton\u2019s urging, to relay concerns about the conversations. Both Vindman and Hill met with NSC lawyers on the same day, July 10, after Bolton cut the Danylyuk meeting short.\n\nSondland was careful to say in other areas of his opening statement that he did not \u201crecall\u201d certain incidents, rather than stating categorically that they never happened. He told lawmakers, for example, that he didn\u2019t remember discussing the vice president or his son, or efforts to investigate them, with any State Department or White House official.\n\nBut the damage has been done. On Monday night, Rep. Joaquin Castro, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote on Twitter that \u201cbased on all the testimony so far, I believe that Ambassador Gordon Sondland committed perjury.\u201d\n\nSondland's attorney declined to comment on Vindman's remarks and Castro's perjury accusation.\n\nThough Castro is the first impeachment investigator to directly accuse Sondland of perjury, other Democrats have questioned his retelling of the events surrounding his interactions with Ukrainians, which have been described by multiple witnesses as inappropriate.\n\nSondland, who had a direct line to Trump, assured fellow ambassadors in September text messages obtained by lawmakers that Trump was not attempting to coerce Ukraine to do his bidding by withholding a White House visit or military aid.\n\nSondland visited the Capitol on Monday to review the transcript of his testimony, a routine step for witnesses in congressional probes. Typically, witnesses are given the opportunity to provide supplemental testimony if they wish to add to the record or offer any clarifying or corrective statements -- though they may not alter the substance of their earlier testimony.\n\nPerjury cases against congressional witnesses are famously difficult to prosecute. The testimony has to be shown not only to be incorrect, but also intentionally false. It has to be demonstrated that the false testimony had a material impact on an investigation.\n\n\u201cThe conventional wisdom is that perjury is tough to prove,\u201d said constitutional law scholar Louis Michael Seidman, who teaches at Georgetown Law. \u201cThere needs to be proof that the statement is false, that there was an intent to mislead, and that people were misled. When a witness says \u2018I don\u2019t remember,\u2019 it\u2019s very hard to prove that they did.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Seidman said, a witness can claim they were confused, misunderstood the question, or remembered incorrectly.\n\nRyan Goodman, a law professor at NYU, said \u201cthis kind of perjury may be easier to prove,\u201d however.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like Vindman\u2019s specific recollection of events, especially including his direct confrontation with Sondland, had multiple witnesses, and is backed up by his reporting it to the National Security Council\u2019s Legal Adviser,\u201d Goodman said.\n\nFalse statement cases are not unprecedented. Just this year, Trump associate Roger Stone was indicted on charges including obstruction of an official proceeding and five counts of false statements to Congress related to his conversations during the campaign about WikiLeaks. And last year, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about efforts to build a Trump Tower Moscow in 2016.\n\nThose charges, however, were brought by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2014it\u2019s unlikely that the Justice Department would take action on a criminal referral by Democrats from an impeachment inquiry that the White House has deemed invalid.\n\n\u201cWould the Trump administration ever prosecute Sondland for perjury?\u201d Seidman said. \u201cI think you know the answer to that question!\u201d\n\nStill, a criminal referral from Congress \u201ccould itself do serious damage\u201d to Sondland\u2019s reputation, Goodman said, \u201ceven if this Justice Department does not pursue it.\u201d\n\nThe House could also wait to make the referral until after the 2020 election, when a new administration could be taking the reins, Goodman added. And a new administration could reopen the case if it were shut down by Barr\u2019s DOJ.\n\nAfter Mueller\u2019s probe ended, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff sent a criminal referral to DOJ for Blackwater founder Erik Prince, who Schiff alleged \"willingly misled\" the panel during testimony in 2017 with \u201cmanifest and substantial falsehoods that materially impaired the committee's investigation.\u201d So far, nothing has come of the referral.", "description": "", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio", "Kyle Cheney"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/de/1a/f34ade4941c58db07f4a855d9e45/191029-sondland-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
