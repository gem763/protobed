It\u2019s the latest in a series of lawsuits attempting to hold carriers accountable for failing to prevent the attacks.\n\nAs previous Motherboard investigations have detailed, SIM hijacking (or SIM swapping) involves a hacker bribing or conning a wireless carrier employee to port out a user\u2019s phone number right out from under them. Using the stolen phone number, attackers can do anything from selling the target\u2019s Instagram account for cash, to emptying their bank and cryptocurrency accounts.\n\nIn his complaint, Torrance, California resident Seth Shapiro says he was targeted multiple times by the same attackers, losing $1.8 million in both cryptocurrency and traditional cash.\n\n\n\n\u201cAT&T failed to implement sufficient data security systems and procedures and failed to supervise its own personnel, instead standing by as its employees used their position at the company to gain unauthorized access to Mr. Shapiro\u2019s account in order to rob, extort, and threaten him in exchange for money,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\n\nA different subscriber sued AT&T last year for $220 million, claiming the carrier failed to adequately secure his account. T-Mobile was also sued last year after a customer lost thousands of dollars after his number was ported from T-Mobile to an AT&T account under the hackers control.\n\nShapiro told a local California Fox affiliate that he was SIM hijacked four times in total, the two biggest attacks coming in the same day. After the first attack, Shapiro said he went to a local AT&T store to demand help and get a new phone, only to be hijacked again.\n\n\u201cI said I want your assurance that you\u2019re not gonna allow the number to be swapped out because this is literally financial life or death for my family, and they said yeah absolutely, we\u2019re monitoring it,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cSo we turned the number on, I\u2019m standing in the AT&T store, and within two minutes, it went dead again, and that\u2019s when they stole our life savings.\u201d\n\nThe complaint states investigators were not only able to identify the hackers, but the two Arizona AT&T employees who helped facilitate the scam. One employee took $4,300 to aid in the hijack, while another was paid just $585.25. Investigators also obtained chat logs featuring the hackers discussing how they were going to spend their newfound fortune.\n\nCarriers, for their part, haven\u2019t much wanted to talk about why they\u2019ve continually failed to stop employees from scamming the company\u2019s customers. Even more apathetic has been the FCC, which has yet to so much as even meaningfully comment on the rise of such attacks. That said, both the FTC and the FBI have ramped up warnings about SIM hijacking over the last year.\n\nShapiro\u2019s lawsuit against AT&T may never actually see the inside of a courtroom.\n\nCarriers have been able to skirt legal accountability for SIM hijacking and location data scandals thanks to fine print in their customer contracts. Such language bans subscribers from suing carriers, instead forcing them into binding arbitration, a lopsided process that favors corporations the lion\u2019s share of the time.\n\nAccording to the complaint, one of the hackers who targeted Shapiro was Joel Ortiz, a Boston resident convicted earlier this year in the SIM hijacking attacks on 40 people, resulting in the theft of more than $5 million. Ortiz is currently serving a 10 year prison sentence in San Quentin.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to avoid being a victim yourself, make sure to read Motherboard\u2019s guide to protecting yourself from SIM hijacking.", "description": "Neither carriers nor the FCC are doing enough to protect consumers from the rise of such attacks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db1ceee9e16fc008c1ceb84/lede/1571934064522-sim.jpeg?crop=0.9977777777777778xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
