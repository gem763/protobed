Photo: Matt Sayles/Getty Images\n\nOver the course of her 40-year career Laura Dern has made a habit of working with Hollywood\u2019s very best filmmakers, and says that today she considers Jurassic Park\u2019s Steven Spielberg and Blue Velvet\u2019s David Lynch \u201cfamily.\u201d But her last year working with filmmakers and real-life partners Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach on Little Women and Marriage Story, respectively, has been one for the books. Knowing how to make her audience jealous while filming Inside the Actors Studio this week, the Emmy and Golden Globe winner recounted riding the Dern-aissance wave right into the Baumbach\u2013Gerwig home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if I can\u2019t talk about one experience without the other,\u201d Dern said of filming the pair of features. \u201cBut to spend last year together \u2014 whether they liked it or not \u2014 almost, literally, moving into their apartment with them, I had the time of my life.\u201d\n\nThe expansive, two-hour conversation, which had Dern sitting with Gerwig herself for a career deep dive, was filmed as part of the rebooted interview series and quickly turned into a mutual lovefest between the two multi-hyphenate women.\n\n\u201cThe process of talking about storytelling with Noah and then with you, even before we came to these films and characters, was so amazing,\u201d Dern told Gerwig, adding that to work with her on \u201can extraordinary film\u201d and Baumbach on \u201cone of the more moving and beautiful films I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d was to work with \u201cperfect writers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no word that doesn\u2019t feel like the truth \u2014 you would be shy to even try something differently,\u201d Dern said of the two scripts. \u201cYou find the truth in the words instead of what\u2019s inferred in them, and that is an incredible gift as an actor.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t lost on Gerwig that Little Women and Marriage Story have the Big Little Lies star playing about as opposite a pair of characters as possible: one the iconically maternal Marmee March and the other a calculating, high-ranking divorce attorney named Nora Fanshaw.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about so many times that in the same year you play a seductive, powerful, sneaky divorce attorney who\u2019s so skilled at breaking families apart, and also play the woman who keeps the family together,\u201d Gerwig told Dern. \u201cIt\u2019s so fitting for your career that you\u2019re playing these two polar opposites in the same year!\u201d\n\nFor the full sit-down (which includes delightful anecdotes, such as Gerwig texting Dern while nursing her newborn and watching Big Little Lies), tune into Inside the Actors Studio later this fall when episodes return October 13.", "description": "\u201cI had the time of my life.\u201d", "authors": ["Benjamin Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/04/04-laura-dern-greta-gerwig.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
