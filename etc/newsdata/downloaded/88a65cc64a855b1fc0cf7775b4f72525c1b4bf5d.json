We have to agree with the judges though; he has to up the ante next week.\n\nWATCH IT HERE:\n\nMICAYLA \u2013 DANGEROUS WOMAN\n\nThe 18-year-old didn't fare so well with her first performance. The Roxette song was too big for her. She made a comeback her second song putting a spin on it that even Ariana Grande would approve.\n\nWATCH IT HERE:\n\nLUYOLO \u2013 OMG\n\nOMG is how we would describe this performance! As Randall said, who is this guy? Luyolo has been improving consistently and has shown the most growth throughout this competition. Both of his songs were executed well and showed different sides of him as a performer.\n\nWATCH IT HERE:\n\nSNEZIEY - UMUNTU NGABANTU\n\nWith this performance, it was showstopper round two for Sneziey as she showcased her dance moves and vocals. It got high praise from Somizi, with a 'whoo shem'.\n\nWATCH IT HERE:\n\nTune in to Idols SA Sundays at 17:00 on Mzansi Magic (DStv 161).\n\nCompiled by Leandra Engelbrecht.", "description": "This week the top 4 gave it their all to secure a place in the top 3, and a trip to New York.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7982/9ec9092d12b04e938b870578d5330821.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
