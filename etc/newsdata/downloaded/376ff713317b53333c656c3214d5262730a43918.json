Katie Hill threatens legal action over nude photos", "language": "en", "text": "Hill, however, has denied having a sexual relationship with her male legislative director, Graham Kelly. The conservative website RedState.org. reported that allegation initially on Oct. 18 and published a nude photo of Hill. The Hill-Kelly relationship was purportedly uncovered by Hill\u2019s husband, Kenny Heslep. There is no proof that an improper relationship between Hill and Kelly \u2014 who also worked on her campaign \u2014 occurred. The House Ethics Committee is investigating the issue.\n\nThe 32-year-old has asked the U.S. Capitol Police to look into whether any criminal laws were violated by release of the photos.\n\nThe Daily Mail followed RedState\u2019s initial report with the release of an array of intimate photos of Hill on Thursday, including one of her using a bong while naked. The Daily Mail did not respond to requests for comment about Hill\u2019s threat of legal action.\n\n\u201cYou have also exposed your publication to grave legal consequences for California has some of the strongest criminal laws in the United States against the secretive generation and distribution of private, sexual images,\u201d Elias and Jacobs asserted in their letter to the Daily Mail. \u201cThe California Penal Code accordingly makes it a criminal offense to \u2018intentionally distribute the image of the intimate body part or parts of another identifiable person.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn one photo, the Daily Mail reported Hill had a \u201cNazi-era tattoo.\u201d Hill\u2019s attorneys strongly denied this accusation and suggested the publication might have defamed her.\n\n\u201cThe claim that Representative Hill has Nazi imagery on her body in the form of a tattoo is false and defamatory,\u201d Elias and Jacobs said. \u201cWe demand that you immediately cease and desist the publication of these abusive and spurious images. The continued publication by your outlet or others of these images will warrant legal response.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5c/c7/8ff961ca44f7bb058e851044673f/191022-katie-hill-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
