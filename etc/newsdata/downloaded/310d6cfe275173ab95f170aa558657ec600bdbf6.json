However, as revealed by Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, there was a version that not only teased the arrival of the Avengers, but could\u2019ve blown Marvel\u2019s whole door wide open.\n\nWhile accepting the Saturn Awards\u2019 first-ever Stan Lee World Builder Award, remotely via satellite, Feige shared a never-before-shared alternate post-credits scene from the first Iron Man. The Saturn Awards Twitter account later shared the Iron Man clip online through a retweet of MCU Direct.\n\nThis newly-released 'never-before-seen' deleted alternate scene from 2008's #IronMan reveals Nick Fury mentioning \"radioactive bug bites\" and \"mutants\" in his Avengers Initiative dialogue!

Jackson) arrives unexpectedly to invite Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) to join the Avengers Initiative. This version essentially does the same thing, but it\u2019s how Nick does it that\u2019s surprising: \u201cAs if gamma accidents, radioactive bug bites, and assorted mutants weren\u2019t enough,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to deal with a spoiled brat who doesn\u2019t play well with others and wants to keep all his toys to himself.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right: There was a version of that pivotal post-credits scene in Iron Man where Nick Fury kinda sorta name-dropped the X-Men, as well as Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk. While he doesn\u2019t mention any of those characters or franchises by name, it\u2019s pretty clear who and what he\u2019s talking about. As cool as it is, it\u2019s no surprise they didn\u2019t go with this version, because it was essentially promising something they couldn\u2019t deliver. Up until recently, Fox held the rights to the X-Men, and Spider-Man is still owned by Sony.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s no coincidence that this clip is being shared after Disney\u2019s acquisition of Fox, which brought the X-Men one step closer to joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nBut it also comes with a bit of a sting, as Spider-Man did join the MCU, only for the deal between Disney and Sony to fall apart.\n\nFeige said the clip, along with some others, will be included in the upcoming Infinity Saga DVD box set, which includes Disney\u2019s full slate of Marvel films through Avengers: Endgame.", "description": "Iron Man\u2019s post-credits scene was a game-changing moment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, because it was the very thing that established the MCU in the first place.
