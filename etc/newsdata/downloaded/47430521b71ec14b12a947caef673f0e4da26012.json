(Alexei Nikolsky/Sputnik/Kremlin Pool/AP)\n\nThe local elections that sparked a summer of protest in Moscow and St. Petersburg were finally held Sunday, and from one end of Russia to the other, candidates friendly to the Kremlin for the most part romped to victory \u2014 because they faced almost no real opposition.\n\nLocal election commissions had made sure to strike activists off the ballot on one pretext or another, and local media ignored those who did manage to stay in the race.\n\nBut in a move that\u2019s sure to attract skeptical attention, a think tank launched in 2012 by a former Kremlin insider announced Sunday evening that it had decided not to release the results of exit polls in the race for Moscow\u2019s city council. The organization, called the Civil Society Development Foundation, said too many voters had refused to cooperate.\n\nGiven Muscovites\u2019 support for the opposition and distrust of the authorities \u2014 as revealed in several recent polls \u2014 a widespread refusal to take part in exit polling is plausible.\n\nBut in a city that has seen weekly demonstrations and a brutal police crackdown in late July, suspicions run high, and any perception of flagrant fiddling could be enough to keep the protests going \u2014 as happened after a parliamentary election in 2011 that was widely derided as rigged.\n\n\u201cWe received a high rejection rate at the exit from polling stations. In some districts, the failure rate exceeded 70 percent,\u201d the foundation wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\n\u201cIn other districts it is at the level of 45-50 percent. All this suggests that the publication of such unweighted and conflicting data would be an unprofessional act.\u201d\n\n[Seeking democracy on the streets of Russia]\n\nRussians with long memories might recall that exit polling provoked huge demonstrations in Ukraine in 2004 because the announced results were so at odds with the polls. And those protests led to the Orange Revolution \u2014 which played a significant role in turning Russian President Vladimir Putin sharply against free elections and protests.\n\nRussia\u2019s telecommunications agency, Roskomnadzor, announced Sunday that it had detected political advertising on Facebook, YouTube and Google, which it said is illegal on election day under Russian law. The agency said this wasn\u2019t the first time it had spotted such ads, and it suggested they could be viewed as meddling by foreign companies in Russia\u2019s sovereign affairs \u201cand obstructing the holding of democratic elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese kinds of actions by foreign companies are inadmissible,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\n\nThe agency said it would turn over its information to a parliamentary committee formed this summer to investigate foreign interference in Russian elections. Committee chairmanVasily Piskaryov spoke to reporters on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe have earlier sent requests to the Russian Central Elections Commission and Roskomnadzor to receive materials about the meddling in our internal affairs and after studying them we want to invite representatives of these companies to a meeting of the committee to give their explanations,\u201d Piskaryov said.\n\nThe day brought a slew of reports of electoral shenanigans, most of them unverifiable \u2014 ballot boxes spirited away, dead people voting. In Tyva, near the border with Mongolia, men on horseback took shots at a bus carrying election observers, but no one was reported hurt.\n\n[In Russia\u2019s local elections, the vote totals are not what really count]\n\nIn Moscow, 13 people were detained when they walked along Tverskaya Street in the center of the city with T-shirts bearing the likenesses of protesters arrested and sentenced for taking part in this summer\u2019s demonstrations. Among the 13 was Maria Alyokhina of the punk band Pussy Riot, who spent more than a year in prison in 2012 and 2013 for singing a song denouncing Putin in Moscow\u2019s Cathedral of Christ the Savior.\n\nBy midafternoon, the co-chair of the beleaguered election watchdog nonprofit Golos said, it was aware of \u201cno flagrant violations.\u201d\n\nThe situation varied from region to region, Grigory Melkonyants told the Interfax news agency: \u201cIt is hot somewhere, it is calmer somewhere else.\u201d\n\n\u201cBusing and bribing voters are unfortunately a serious concern in Siberia and the Far East,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for Moscow, the voting so far is going on more or less well. There are some violations, but they are not widespread.\u201d\n\nIgor Borisov, the co-chair of the monitoring working group of the Russian Presidential Human Rights Council, told Interfax that \u201cthere are no flagrant breaches or encroachments on electoral rights.\u201d\n\nAnd Sunday evening, after the polls closed, the head of the Central Election Commission, Ella Pamfilova, told reporters \u201cwe have not recorded serious violations that would cast doubt on the will of voters. At least we don\u2019t know anything about such cases.\u201d\n\nElections were held in a few dozen cities and regions. In several regions, acting governors who had been appointed within the past year by Putin were running for election \u2014 and results typically showed them getting super majorities.\n\nEarly results showed the acting governor in Stavropol with 79.8 percent of the vote, in Lipetsk with 64.5 percent, in Bashkiria with 85.3 percent, and in Zabaikalsk \u2014 90.2 percent. By late evening, most of the votes countrywide had yet to be counted. Opposition activists, who had been hoping for a moral victory, will make what they can of the results on Monday.\n\nRead more:\n\nCommunists turn out for protest in Moscow\n\nRussia, Ukraine exchange prisoners in bid to ease tension between the two nations\n\nAmerican held in Russia on suspicion of being a spy sent back to jail for another two months\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "It was a summer of protest in Moscow and St. Petersburg, but around the country, local election commissions had made sure to strike activists off the ballot, and local media ignored those who managed to stay in the race.", "authors": ["Will Englund", "Assignment Editor On The Washington Post'S Foreign Desk", "A Veteran Moscow Correspondent", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nn2TTdS8eztIcdq233mBWG-9TmA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WXWSYGWSOEI6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
