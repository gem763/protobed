The 112.6 \u00d7 69.9 \u00d7 45.3 mm camera weighs just 370g, resulting in what Sigma calls a \u201cpocketable\u201d full-frame camera.\n\nThe Sigma fp is compatible with a wide range of accessories, which can increase its size and weight significantly when attached. The camera\u2019s use of the L-Mount standard means that it\u2019s compatible with a range of lenses from Leica, Panasonic, and of course Sigma itself.\n\nThe Sigma fp also comes equipped with an HDMI port, and the company says it supports external flash sync, mic, headphone, and remote shutter accessories. You can get an idea of the range of accessories supported in this Sigma video, which shows just how massive the setups for this \u201cpocketable\u201d camera can get:\n\nIn terms of specs, the Sigma fp supports an ISO range of 100-25600, has a 49-point autofocus system, can film in 4K, and includes electronic image stabilization. There\u2019s a 3.2-inch touchscreen on the camera, but no viewfinder, and the camera also has a quiet electronic shutter in front of its Bayer sensor. Its limited amount of physical controls won\u2019t be for everyone, but compromises are inevitable when you\u2019re trying to produce a camera this small.", "description": "The Sigma fp full-frame mirrorless camera is now available to pre-order for $1,900 with a release date of October 25th.
