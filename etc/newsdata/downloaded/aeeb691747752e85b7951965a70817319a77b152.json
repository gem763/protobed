Scott Coker says 'Let's do it'", "language": "en", "text": "UNCASVILLE, Conn. \u2013 Bellator president Scott Coker has heard Claressa Shields\u2019 comments about potentially moving into MMA and says the possibility may be there for the two-time Olympic gold medalist to do it with Bellator.\n\nWomen\u2019s boxing superstar Shields went public this week about her frustration with the sport of women\u2019s boxing and suggested that she may switch codes and compete in mixed martial arts in the future.\n\nWhen that possibility was put to Coker at the Bellator 232 post-fight press conference, the Bellator boss said there would be hurdles to get over, but he wasn\u2019t opposed to the possibility of Shields competing inside the Bellator cage in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a fight for her at 160 (pounds), because the top of our weight classes is 145,\u201d Coker explained. \u201cBut if she wants to come down, maybe we can have her compete. Or if some of the girls want to go up and fight, then maybe we could fight her.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that Bellator doesn\u2019t have the weight class to sustain a lengthy MMA career and potential world title opportunity for Shields, Coker did say he could make things work to allow Shields to compete on the big stage in specially arranged superfights, as he has done before.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s not our core business, fighting at 160 pounds,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, just like with Keri (Melendez) and just like with Ava (Knight), if it makes sense and we (can) put her in some superfights, let\u2019s do it. I\u2019m not afraid to do that.\u201d", "description": "Bellator president Scott Coker says he's open to the possibility of two-time Olympic boxing champion Claressa Shields competing in his cage.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Matt Erickson", "Blue Corner", "Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan", "John Morgan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/claressa-shields-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
