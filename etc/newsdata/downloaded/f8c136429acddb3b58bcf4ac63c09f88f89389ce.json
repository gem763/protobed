The party has not decided to move away from race-based redress policies, however, we unequivocally reject the ANC's version of redress which operates to enrich and re-enrich the connected elite,\" Maimane said then.\n\nThis has been an ideological battleground in the party for several years, since at least 2013, when the issue of BEE caused a row between then party leader Zille and the DA's former parliamentary leader, Lindiwe Mazibuko.\n\nZille accused Mazibuko of getting the party's policy on BEE wrong in supporting BEE legislation proposed by the ANC, while Mazibuko feared the party's resultant flip-flop could cost it at the 2014 elections.\n\nMeanwhile, Walters is still flying under the radar. He has previously stated that he does not campaign through the media. When contacted by News24 on Wednesday, he confirmed that this was still his position.", "description": "DA federal chairperson candidate Mike Waters says the race for the position is much closer than many people expect.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2867/d4a8f8312f034daeb276aa420348a77c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
