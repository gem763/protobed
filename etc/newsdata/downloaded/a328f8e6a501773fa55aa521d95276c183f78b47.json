Shortly after the president\u2019s admission, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry. The drama in Washington is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Though market strategists agree that the potential impeachment injects another dose of uncertainty into the markets, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that stocks are doomed.\n\nFor instance, the markets reacted quite differently to the other two instances when a sitting U.S. president was impeached. \u201cFor equities, remember we\u2019ve seen something like this twice and had two very different results,\u201d Renaissance Macro\u2019s Neil Dutta said in an email Tuesday. \u201cDuring the Nixon saga, stocks were already tumbling (of course, we were going into recession) and kept falling after the formal inquiry process started. During the Clinton impeachment process, markets exploded to the upside as the economy boomed.\u201d\n\nDutta argued that market fundamentals eventually matter more than political events.\n\nOctober volatility\n\nWith October just around the corner and the fourth quarter kicking off, investors should brace for a wild ride. According to LPL Financial\u2019s Ryan Detrick, if history is any indication, no other month has seen more 1% market moves in either direction for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) going back to 1950.\n\nThough the impeachment inquiry may not affect the markets drastically, the legislative hold could impact markets. Specifically, lack of progress on the ongoing trade war may rock stocks in the upcoming month. The U.S. and China are scheduled to hold high level trade negotiations; however, it is unclear whether or not those talks will stake place in light of the political unrest in Washington.\n\nJobs report\n\nFriday, investors will get a pulse on the U.S. labor market when the Labor Department releases September\u2019s jobs report. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg are expecting that the U.S. economy added 140,000 nonfarm payrolls in August, up from the 130,000 jobs added in August. The unemployment rate is expected to have remained at 3.7%.\n\nA 'Help Wanted' sign in a shop window in San Francisco, California.

Wage growth has also been solid. Economists acknowledge that the labor market may be losing steam, but they argue that it doesn\u2019t mean that the labor market is materially weakening. \u201cThe labor market overall does not show material signs of weakness,\u201d Nomura wrote in a note to clients Friday. \u201cInstead, we view the slowdown as consistent with waning economic momentum as fiscal stimulus fades and growth returns to potential.\u201d\n\nCapitol Economics pointed out that it is important to note that even as the General Motors (GM) strike rages on, it won\u2019t affect the September jobs figures. \u201cThe ongoing strike by 46,000 auto workers at General Motors involves only a tiny share of the US workforce, but it is still likely to have a notable impact on the economic data,\u201d the research firm wrote in a note Friday. \u201cNot only has the strike halted production at all GM plants, which account for 20% of domestic vehicle production, but it is also forcing other firms further up the supply chain to shutter plants and lay off workers. The strike began too late to influence this month\u2019s non-farm payrolls figures, but it is likely to result in a steep decline in manufacturing output.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, investors can expect earnings reports from StitchFix, Lennar, Bed Bath & Beyond, PepsiCo, Constellation Brands, and Costco this week.", "description": "Political drama in Washington and the September jobs report will take centerstage this week.", "authors": ["Heidi Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0yD1.OjuXOAMeYgmdsZYLw--~B/aD0zMzAwO3c9NDMwNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/4e54c600-e2b4-11e9-9fb4-0713a77d770b", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
