A programme, which begins in November, will include a three-day boot camp in Singapore and a two-week immersion programme in Bangalore where participants will meet Indian enterprises and participate in field trips.\n\nAnother partnership is with The Indus Entrepreneurs Global, a startup network founded in Silicon Valley, to connect Singapore startups to mentors and venture capitalists in the Indian startup scene.\n\nEnterprise Singapore's third MOU is with YourStory, India\u2019s mediatech platform for startups and entrepreneurs, to strengthen mindshare between the startup communities of both countries and highlight collaboration opportunities.\n\nThe fourth MOU is between Anthill Ventures and CapitaLand's coworking space BRIDGE+ to provide a conducive environment for tech startups and companies to collaborate. The launch pad in CapitaLand's International Tech Park Bangalore is also where the GIA Acceleration Programme will be conducted.\n\nTan Soon Kim, assistant chief executive officer of Enterprise Singapore, told The Business Times that Bangalore was chosen as the launch city because of its high concentration of startup players, as the \"Silicon Valley of India\".\n\nHe added that the GIA has a bilateral element, as they also want to encourage Indian startups to come to Singapore, so that they can tap Singapore's rich ecosystem and branch out into South-east Asia.\n\n\"So there will be two gigantic markets, one which is 1.3 billion strong, and another one is 650 million strong. Collectively it's probably close to two billion. So once we can link both markets up, it's a huge market size and all within flying radius of four to five hours,\" Mr Tan said.\n\nWhile in Bangalore, Mr Iswaran and a Singapore business delegation will meet startup ecosystem players to discuss potential collaboration.\n\nIndia is a significant trading partner of Singapore, with total bilateral trade amounting to S$26.4 billion in 2018. Singapore\u2019s investments in India have also grown exponentially in the past decade with Singapore becoming India\u2019s largest investor in FY2018.\n\nIn addition to India, GIA also operates in Thailand, China, Germany, Indonesia, France, Japan, the US and Vietnam.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - SINGAPORE'S technology startups can now get access to India's\u00a0growing innovation ecosystem through the Global Innovation Alliance (GIA) network, which has expanded into Bangalore. .
