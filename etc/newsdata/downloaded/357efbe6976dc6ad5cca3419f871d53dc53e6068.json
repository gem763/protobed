I made no such claim.\"\n\nMashaba said he has experienced \"the rise of race denialism under the banner of non-racialism\".\n\nWhile he believed that merit and performance should be the only considerations, he said this was not achieved because there was still a direct correlation between poverty and race.\n\n\"I say this with the hindsight of three years as the mayor of one of the most unequal cities in the world. Having spent a great deal of time in the poorest areas of the city, such as Protea South and Ivory Park,\" he wrote in the publication.\n\nHe added that the issue was nuanced and that he had a problem with those \"who would have us turn colour blind\" or the idea that race should be the sole consideration in the conversation of economic exclusion.\n\nThis, Mashaba said, was not in conflict with his 2015 speech and in fact, complements it. An extract from the speech says the ANC has failed to uplift black people, he said, as affirmative action has resulted in the rise of a \"black elite\" while leaving millions of the majority of black people behind.\n\nHe said he advocated for a different kind of redress that would correct past wrongs, including inequality and poverty along racial lines, but added he would not advocate for affirmative action and BEE because they are misguided policies and \"causes of economic exclusion\".\n\nLast week, Mashaba said in his resignation speech that the election of Zille as chairperson of the DA's federal council was a \"victory for people in the DA who stand diametrically opposed to [his] beliefs and value system\", News24 reported.\n\nIn turn, Zille said she wouldn't say too much about the party's position but added: \"He joined [the DA] with great enthusiasm when I was still the leader. I still hold the same values as then. I don't know what has changed.\"", "description": "Outgoing Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says there was no hypocrisy in his resignation speech.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9500/8fb73fd29ac341f284f0e05f6225ea38.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
