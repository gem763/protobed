They are not", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\nSTUTTGART, Germany -- Simone Biles topped the all-around standings by more than two points, got two new skills named after her and made the finals in all four events.\n\nHo-hum.\n\n\u201cOverall, I don\u2019t know. I still feel like I could do better,\u201d Biles said Saturday night when asked to assess her first day of competition at the world gymnastics championships. \u201cBut my goal going into tonight was not to do great, it was just to do well. I feel like I accomplished that.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a gymnastics fan, savor this time. Even if you\u2019re not a gymnastics fan but appreciate incredible achievements in sports, know that you are witnessing greatness.\n\nBiles is so singularly talented that it\u2019s easy to lose perspective at just how special an athlete she is. Like Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods or Michael Phelps in their heydays, the extraordinary has become the norm with her.\n\nBut there is nothing normal about what she is doing.\n\nFor any other gymnast, Saturday night\u2019s performance would have been the defining one of her career. Biles posted the highest scores on both balance beam and floor exercise, and trailed teammate Jade Carey on vault by a mere .001 points.\n\nEven on uneven bars, which made her want to \u201cvomit \u2026 it was so bad,\u201d Biles had the seventh-highest score.\n\nAnd then, of course there were the new skills. Her triple-twisting, double somersault on floor exercise is so difficult, no other woman even tries it. Same for her double-twisting, double somersault on balance beam.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than just the difficulty. There are plenty of gymnasts who try hard skills and look as if they\u2019re inches away from death while doing them. Go watch some of the scary crashes on vault and you\u2019ll see exactly what I mean.\n\nBiles, though, doesn\u2019t throw skills just to say she did them. If she\u2019s going to compete at something, it\u2019s going to be perfect. Or pretty darn close.\n\nTake the double-double on beam. Or, as it will be known forever now, the Biles.\n\nTo pull it off, Biles has to twist while flipping, and it takes an incredible amount of power and precision to do it. Oftentimes she takes several seconds to marshal the energy she\u2019s going to need before doing the trick.\n\nOn Saturday, though, she hesitated only briefly before running down the beam \u2013 which is only 4-inches wide, mind you, and 4 feet off the floor. And Biles did the double-double with such ease, that people who didn\u2019t know what they were seeing probably thought it was a pretty standard move.\n\nWhich it most certainly is not.\n\nBiles was grinning when she landed, and she ran off the podium clapping.\n\nSimone Biles nailed her balance beam performance on Saturday.

It finally felt good to go out there and hit a beam routine like I train because I feel like every time I go up to compete beam, I just like bomb it,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it felt really good to nail it.\u201d\n\nAnd though she wouldn\u2019t say it, send a message to the International Gymnastics Federation.\n\nOPINION: Simone Biles penalized for having skills other gymnasts can't pull off\n\nEvery skill in gymnastics is assigned a letter, which corresponds to a numerical value. An \u201cA\u201d skill is worth a tenth of a point, and every letter in the alphabet that follows is an additional tenth. So a \u201cD\u201d skill is four-tenths of a point while the rare \u201cJ\u201d skill is worth a full point.\n\nThe women\u2019s technical committee decided this week that Biles\u2019 double-double would be an \u201cH\u201d skill, while almost everyone else agrees it should be at least an \u201cI.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have a value too low,\u201d national team coordinator Tom Forster said. \u201cIt needs to be up one more.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s rationale was that it didn\u2019t want to encourage gymnasts from trying skills they aren\u2019t capable of. But the value of a skill is the value of a skill, and to punish Biles because of what other gymnasts \u201cmight\u201d do is absurd.\n\nBiles said she considered not doing it \u2013 why go through all that effort to do something so hard when it\u2019s not going to be properly recognized? \u2013 but ultimately decided to go ahead. Time and again she has said that she\u2019s not doing gymnastics for medals or titles \u2013 she already has plenty of those \u2013 but to see how far she can push herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy she has more skills named after her now because that\u2019s been a really big deal for her,\u201d Forster said. \u201cAnd she did a great job.\u201d\n\nShe always does.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.", "description": "Simone Biles tops the all-around standings at the world gymnastics championships by more than two points after nailing two difficult new skills.", "authors": ["Nancy Armour", "Published P.M.
