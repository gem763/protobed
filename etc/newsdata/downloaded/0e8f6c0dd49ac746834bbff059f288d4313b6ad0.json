The company told shareholders it was \"extremely fragmented and has high levels of competition\".\n\n\"The performance of the five:am CGU has been marginally lower in the year than that anticipated by management, with wider economic conditions and forecasted growth rates hardening in the year,\" the company told shareholders in its annual report for the year to May 31.\n\n\"During the second half of the year, management reviewed its strategy for the five:am brand and as a result revised the longer term cash flows expected to result from the CGU.\"\n\nPotential buyers will no doubt have read the comments and wondering whether there may be a bargain up for grabs.\n\nIt comes amid a wider strategic review at PZ Cussons which sparked a new strategy.\n\nThe strategy included focused investment in core personal care and beauty brands in growth markets, simplification of its activities in Nigeria and disposal of non-core brands. Five:am is understood to fit into the third bucket.\n\nIt comes amid a busy time in Australian food and beverages sector M &A deals. While KKR & Co is in the process of finalising its $3.2 billion deal to buy Arnott's, Japan's Kirin hasn't given up hopes of selling Lion Dairy and Drinks, while Asahi is also working to complete its $16 billion Carlton & United Breweries purchase.", "description": "A strategic review inside Britain's PZ Cussons is set to claim one of its biggest Australian investments.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_428/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/72330f643ce433d208f312d9e057d56f04c9df2a", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
