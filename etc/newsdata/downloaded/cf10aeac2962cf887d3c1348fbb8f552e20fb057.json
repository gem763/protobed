REUTERS/Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah\n\nThousands gathered in Freedom Square, where ousted president Omar al-Bashir held a large rally in his final months in power, to call for the dissolution of his National Congress Party and to put Bashir-era officials on trial for alleged corruption.\n\nA key demand of the rally, called by the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) that spearheaded anti-Bashir demonstrations that led to his overthrow, was to hold accountable those responsible for a deadly raid on a sit-in near the Defence Ministry on June 3.\n\n\u201cMartyrs first! The killer is still free!\u201d protesters chanted.\n\nLate on Sunday, after the SPA called for the rally, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok named a commission to investigate the raid in which security forces killed dozens.\n\nThe number of victims has been disputed. Doctors linked to the opposition said nearly 130 were killed in the raid and ensuing violence. Officials have acknowledged 87 deaths.\n\nThe SPA welcomed the appointment of the commission, calling it \u201cthe first brick in the structure of a fair investigation and the revelation of the perpetrators of the crime\u201d.\n\nThe commission will be headed by human rights lawyer Nabil Adib. It will include senior security officers as well as other lawyers.\n\nProtesters demanded a swift response in its investigation of the raid on the sit-in, which was a culmination of 16 weeks of protests that led to army officers turning against Bashir and replacing him with a military council.\n\n\u201cI am taking part in this rally to demand accountability for the murderers of the revolution\u2019s martyrs,\u201d said Mazen Mostafa, a 20-year-old university student.\n\nIn August, civilian and protest groups, including the SPA, and the military, signed a three-year power-sharing deal leading to the formation of a sovereign council and the appointment of a technocratic, transitional government under Hamdok.\n\nThe investigative commission will be charged with identifying those responsible for breaking up the sit-in, establishing the number of dead, wounded and missing, and the financial losses incurred by those affected.\n\nIt is supposed to finish its work in three months, with possible one-month extensions if it submits progress reports.\n\n\u201cWe want the investigative commission to work transparently and investigate all the suspects, including the members of the former (military) council who are now members of the sovereign council,\u201d said Hadeel Ahmed, a 28-year-old demonstrator.\n\n\u201cWe will not accept any complacency in the commission\u2019s work and we will guard the blood of the martyrs.\u201d\n\nIn a speech televised on Monday evening to commemorate the 55th anniversary of Sudan\u2019s October 1964 revolution, Hamdok praised the uprising that led to Bashir\u2019s ouster and said much work needed to be done to fulfil its demands.\n\n\u201cThe issue of justice for your government is not a matter of political gain, it is a matter of principle that includes restitution of rights and grievances, healing wounds and providing compensation to survivors and victims over the past 30 years,\u201d he said.", "description": "Tens of thousands of Sudanese demonstrated in Khartoum and other cities on Monday to call for the former ruling party to be dissolved and for ex-officials to be put on trial.", "authors": ["Khalid Abdelaziz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443648652&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0LQ-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
