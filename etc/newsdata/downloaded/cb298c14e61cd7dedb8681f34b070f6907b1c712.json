The document was \u201can exact transcript of my call, done by very talented people that do this,\u201d he said later on the same day. It was \u201can exact transcript,\u201d he claimed on Oct. 11.\n\nAD\n\nThe so-called Whistleblower, before knowing I was going to release the exact Transcript, stated that my call with the Ukrainian President was \u201ccrazy, frightening, and completely lacking in substance related to national security.\u201d This is a very big Lie. Read the Transcript! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019\n\n\u201cThe transcript is a perfect transcript,\u201d he had said the day before. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any further questions.\u201d\n\nThere were questions. There were questions about unusual markings on the document. There were questions about ellipses that interrupted Trump\u2019s comments without explanation. There were questions about the extent to which what was documented was accurate. This was a president who, three weeks before, mobilized government agencies to defend his untrue claim about a hurricane threatening Alabama. Should we assume that the transcript he released was as perfect as he claimed?\n\nAD\n\nHis defenders embraced the idea that the transcript was complete. An increasingly awkward defense that ran in the Wall Street Journal \u2014 shared by the White House with the office of each sitting senator \u2014 insisted that the whistleblower who first raised questions about Trump\u2019s interactions couldn\u2019t be trusted because he used a plural when the transcript conveyed a singular. Trump\u2019s press secretary offered a \u201cfact check\u201d on Twitter, which included Trump mentioning former vice president Joe Biden only once in the call. Trump said the transcript got everything, thanks to expert transcription, and his team embraced it.\n\nAD\n\nThat was never true, as that reporter noted on Oct. 2. We got a reminder of it on Tuesday, when the testimony of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman before the House impeachment inquiry reportedly included a description of elements of the call that didn\u2019t make it into the transcript. One involved Trump talking at more length about Biden.\n\nThis was probably inevitable. It\u2019s not clear how significant the omissions noted by Vindman were, but his testimony blows a massive hole in Trump\u2019s claim that the transcript is a complete and thorough documentation of the call. Yes, that claim was always obviously false, but having a sense of something specific that was apparently excluded makes obvious just how many gaps there could be in the document.\n\nAD\n\nSo why did Trump make his assertion in the first place?\n\nThe most immediate and obvious explanation is that Trump operates only in absolutes. The transcript had to be perfect and compiled by the best stenographers because everything Trump does is the best and most perfect, until it isn't. Trump's default mode is that everything associated with him is flawless, up to and including transcripts that self-identify as potentially flawed.\n\nAD\n\nThen there\u2019s the political argument. Again, Trump was trying to suggest that the impeachment inquiry was predicated on a transcript that was bulletproof. He couldn\u2019t very well wave away the criticisms of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) by saying that the rough transcript undermined their arguments if he admitted it was not a complete record of the call. So it became perfect and, therefore, unassailable. The Democrats didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on because he had released everything there was to release.\n\nAD\n\nThat was a rationale in and of itself. By presenting the transcript as complete, Trump could then argue that there was nothing more to reveal. Subpoenas of staffers? Why? You have the complete transcript sitting right in front of you!\n\nIt was similarly important for Trump to make that case to his base of support. His base continues to stand firmly at his side in part because he leaves them little room to move around. The transcript is perfect, he claimed, and his supporters embrace the idea. That he released the rough transcript became a point of defense for Trump among his supporters: Why would he do that if he weren\u2019t confident he would be exonerated? And, as you see, there\u2019s no quid pro quo in the document!\n\nAD\n\nThat line of defense is brittle by itself, but if one assumes that the transcript itself is incomplete, it collapses nearly immediately.\n\nAD\n\nWhat was revealed in Vindman's testimony isn't that the transcript wasn't complete; we knew that on the day it was released. What was exposed instead was how hollow Trump's claims about the transcript really were.\n\nTrump has learned over the past four years that it doesn\u2019t matter what he says. Whatever claim he makes, whatever defenses he offers, whatever alterations he has to make down the line are all just chaff. They\u2019re clumps of Play-Doh thrown into a large lump. If a recording of the call suddenly became public in which Trump tells Zelensky that he\u2019ll give Ukraine Pennsylvania in exchange for an investigation of Biden and his son Hunter, it would take about 24 hours for his most fervent defenders to mush that into their existing framework.\n\nThe why, then, is as simple as it ever was: Why not?\n\nAD", "description": "It's partly because he has learned that it doesn't matter what he says.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sPdCl6laoDAHdEWnbb818e4xl74=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QV7VPWF22VEGFJQBNO5WVDXWTI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
