The knockout was so resounding that fight referee Celestino Ruiz dispensed with the count and Day was immediately rushed to hospital.\n\nHe remained there until he succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday, surrounded by his friends, family and trainer and mentor Joe Higgins.\n\nAlso on rt.com Maxim Dadashev's tragic death should be accepted as boxing's cruel reality\n\nThe boxing and wider combat sports world is currently mourning Day\u2019s death, and a host of fellow fighters have spoken out in support and remembrance of the two-time New York Golden gloves champion and US Olympic alternate.\n\nLou Di Bella, the fighter\u2019s promoter, said in a statement: \u201cBoxing is what Pat loved to do.

This was not the case for Patrick Day when he left us. Rest in peace and power, Pat, with the angels,\u201d Di Bella wrote.\n\nIt is with the deepest sadness that I share the following statement on Patrick Day. https://t.co/SF1suXCBtB \u2014 Lou DiBella (@loudibella) October 16, 2019\n\nFormer UFC lightweight champion Eddie Alvarez, an Instagram follower of Day\u2019s career admitted the death of \u201ca genuinely great soul with an incredible spirit\u201d had got him \u201cf*cked up\u201d and middleweight boxing champ Gennady Golovkin also extended his deepest condolences.\n\nPatrick Day\u2019s death has got me fucked up ,I followed him on Instagram and observed his training from the outside .
