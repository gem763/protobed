The rally was held for the Republican candidate running in the 9th Congressional District, state Sen. Dan Bishop.\n\nBishop promised the crowd, mostly decked out in Make America Great Again hats, that he would \"defend your values in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nBishop is running in a do-over election from last November after North Carolina's Board of Elections found that a political operative illegally collected absentee mail ballots for the Republican candidate, Mark Harris.\n\nThe state ordered a new election, which will officially be the last race from the 2018 midterms. Harris isn't running again.\n\nDemocrat Dan McCready, the victim of that alleged fraud, says Tuesday's election is a chance for justice.\n\n\"Our right to vote is our most sacred right as Americans,\" McCready said. \"It's a right that people have fought for here at home in the battle for civil rights. And that was stolen from the people.\"\n\nTrump hammered McCready at Monday night's rally for his stance on immigration, saying he supports sanctuary cities (though that's not quite true \u2014 more on that from WFAE here.)\n\nBishop, a social conservative who won the GOP primary in May, was known before this race as a co-sponsor of HB2, North Carolina's bathroom bill that mandated people in government buildings use the bathroom that matches their sex listed on their birth certificate.\n\nHe's embraced Trump. In one TV commercial, he tries to tie McCready to the most liberal members of Congress, whom he called \"crazy liberal clowns.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alan Fram/AP Alan Fram/AP\n\nWhile Trump won the district by 12 percentage points in 2016, Democrats believe McCready can upset Bishop based on his strong performance last November. In early voting, a greater percentage of registered Democrats have cast ballots compared to 2018. A smaller percentage of Republicans have voted early.\n\nOn his way to the rally, Trump told reporters he believes his support will pay off for Bishop. \"I think it's getting less close,\" Trump said. \"If you look at the numbers from two weeks ago, and I got involved about two weeks ago, and the numbers have gone way up.\"\n\nDemocratic consultant Bill Busa says it's a sign of how energized Democratic voters are.\n\n\"Oh, I think this is 2020,\" he said. \"We're here. We're seeing what's going to happen next year \u2014 certainly around the state, and possibly around the country.\"\n\nWhen Republican state lawmakers drew the 9th District, it was designed to be an easy win for the GOP.\n\nIt connects white, wealthy neighborhoods in Charlotte that have given Republicans large margins of victory for decades to rural areas such as Bladen County, the epicenter of the ballot fraud scandal.\n\nBut in the age of Trump, Charlotte is changing.\n\nAnn McDade, 81, has lived in the city her whole life. She's a registered Republican, but she voted early for McCready because of LGBT rights.\n\n\"I just feel like he represents my views,\" McDade said. \"I have a granddaughter who works at an LGBT theater in Virginia, and I just think they need more recognition and acceptance, and I don't think Dan Bishop is that way.\"\n\nSusan Collis was campaigning for Bishop this week at an early voting site in an upscale part of Charlotte.\n\nShe said newcomers have changed Charlotte. She said she sees license plates from northern states all over the city.\n\n\"And there's a whole lot of them coming in from New York, New Jersey, all these other states that are super liberal,\" she said. \"And I can't figure out why. Most of them that I have talked to moved down here \u2014 it's because their grandkids. But they are bringing their politics with them. And they don't like their politics back home.\"", "description": "A do-over congressional election in North Carolina may test whether suburban voters who were once reliably Republican are still loyal.", "authors": ["Steve Harrison"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/09/gettyimages-1167105879_wide-8bbe2e2f5851911e6b5361e2b27a3e8e256cca0a.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
