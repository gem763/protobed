(Oct. 9) AP, AP\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and Miramar, Fla. Mayor Wayne Messam raised $5.00 for his longshot presidential bid over the last Federal Elections Commission filing quarter.\n\nAccording to his filing with the FEC, Messam raised $5.00, with a total of $31,151.44 cash on hand at the end of the quarter.\n\nHe spent no money over the last quarter and has struggled in fundraising over the campaign cycle, only raising a total of about $94,000 so far. In contrast, in just this past quarter, Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren raised about $25 million and $24.6 million, respectively.\n\nMessam's candidacy has struggled to gain traction amid a crowded Democratic field. He has not qualified for any of the Democratic debates and is likely not to qualify for the November debate either, having neither met the polling nor the donation threshold.\n\nMessam's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMore: How do Democrats win in 2020?
