The local farmers\u2019 association said it had dispatched some to Madrid to educate S\u00e1nchez, lest he once again cast his swine before pearls.\n\nA guide to jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico Read more\n\nThe finest version of the ham, jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico bellota, is made from Iberian blackfoot pigs, or from 50% crossbreeds, which spend the last months of their lives roaming the dehesa \u2013 oakland pasture \u2013 feeding on grass and acorns.\n\nOnce slaughtered, the legs are plunged into vats of salt and hung and dry-cured over a range of temperatures for a minimum of 36 months. The best jamones are cured for around four years.\n\nCommenting on what he called S\u00e1nchez\u2019s \u201cserious error\u201d, \u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda Blanco, the famers\u2019 association president, said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t hope for a better advertising campaign, and a free one, at that. As soon as I heard him utter this drivel, I thought: we have to make the most of this.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s love affair with pork goes back millennia and last year the pig population reached 50 million, making them more numerous than humans.\n\nAs its popularity has grown internationally, especially in China, supplies of jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico have not been able to keep pace with demand and the industry has been hit by a series of fraud scandals as suppliers attempt to pass off poor quality ham as top of the range.\n\nOne major supermarket chain was found to be selling ham that had passed its sell-by date but had been repackaged and relabelled. More recently a company was caught selling \u201cSpanish\u201d ham that had in fact originated in Poland.", "description": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez confuses prized jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico for plain old jam\u00f3n serrano in \u2018serious error\u2019", "authors": ["Stephen Burgen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6500a1e8a23cb4f4197d2808f74ad51f7bf0d6bb/0_1_3444_2066/master/3444.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e3f0c13829a489613fb5c4482d6c7fff", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
