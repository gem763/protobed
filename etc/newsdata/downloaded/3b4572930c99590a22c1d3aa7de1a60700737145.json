Nellie signed up and began a volunteer career that has now lasted over 45 years.\n\nA certificate recognizing Nellie's 45 years of service to the Calgary library system. (Andrew Friesen / CBC)\n\n'We became very good friends'\n\nNellie's job was to find out what people liked to read, sign out their books, and bike or bus her way to their homes to deliver the reading material. Naturally, she got to know her clients very well.\n\nThere's one woman in particular that Nellie remembers fondly.\n\n\"Her first name was Mary and I had her for a long time,\" she recalled. \"She was a beautiful lady. She made shortbread cookies that were to die for!\"\n\nNellie continued to deliver books until she moved into a senior's home \u2014 but that didn't stop her from volunteering. Today, she runs a small library in the activity room of the home she lives in.\n\nBringing books to her fellow seniors\n\nNellie gets deliveries of books from the Calgary library system every four months, and keeps track of what her fellow seniors want to read.\n\nThe collection is over 150 books and features lots of westerns and mystery novels, which are popular among her peers.\n\nNellie was recently presented with a certificate that recognizes her four and a half decades of volunteering.\n\nShe's officially the library system's oldest volunteer and is also one of the longest-serving. Nellie says she has no plans to stop.\n\n\"I did it because I needed something to do. I got involved. Here I am, and I'm still doing a library!\"\n\nNellie Befus with her mini-library and Now or Never host Trevor Dineen.
