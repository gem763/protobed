(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)\n\nPresident Donald Trump has turned repeatedly throughout his tenure and his reelection campaign to two targets: immigrants whom he has described as \u201cinvading\u201d the country, and U.S. cities he has called out of control.\n\nThrough his language, the two are linked. His foils are depicted as violent and infested, and in some deep sense at odds with American values.\n\nBut to the extent that each presents real policy challenges \u2014 how to integrate foreigners, what to do about struggling places \u2014 cities and immigrants are intertwined. The president\u2019s two oft-cited problems have historically been solutions to each other.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this symbiotic relationship that immigrants need cities in order to acclimate to a new society, and cities need new immigrants,\u201d said Jacob Vigdor, a professor of public policy at the University of Washington.\n\nResearch by Dowell Myers at the University of Southern California has shown that immigrants increase home values in sagging markets, and Vigdor\u2019s work at the county level has shown that their arrival encourages U.S.-born residents to follow, spurring population growth where it had been declining.\n\nOther studies have shown that some of the biggest urban crime declines have been in neighborhoods where new immigrants have arrived. That\u2019s most likely because foreign-born residents have lower crime rates than native-born ones, and their population growth in neighborhoods previously full of vacant properties can help restore eyes on the street.\n\nOne implication of this is that immigration can help address the problems of urban crime and decay that the president has lamented in cities like Chicago and Baltimore. Put another way, the president\u2019s immigration policies \u2014 rooted in the belief that America has run out of room for even legal migrants \u2014 threatens the cycle of how cities rejuvenate themselves.\n\nThe past 40 years offer a vivid example of how this symbiosis has worked in America. A.K. Sandoval-Strausz, a historian, recounts the period in a book out in November, \u201cBarrio America,\u201d that argues that Hispanic immigration during this era helped save many U.S. cities.\n\nThe accelerating arrival of Hispanic immigrants in the 1970s came at a fortunate moment for many cities. White flight had taken hold. The Great Migration of African-Americans out of the South was winding down.\n\n\u201cIn a way, it\u2019s a twofold historical accident,\u201d said Sandoval-Strausz, a professor at Penn State.\n\nDomestic demographic trends left cities in need of people (and businesses, and tax revenue), just as major new waves of immigrants began to enter the country after the immigration overhaul of 1965.\n\nIn Chicago and Milwaukee, new Hispanic residents blunted population losses. In Boston and Oakland, their arrival helped reverse population declines. In booming cities like Los Angeles and Houston, Hispanic population growth has explained the entirety of the boom.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010 in 76 of the country\u2019s 100 largest metro areas, Hispanics contributed more than any other racial or ethnic group to city population gains, or reduced population losses, according to \u201cDiversity Explosion\u201d by William Frey, a demographer. This Hispanic growth in cities has mattered all the more as African-Americans have increasingly moved to the suburbs, too.\n\nToday, Sandoval-Strausz says too much focus has been placed on the white, college-educated \u201ccreative class\u201d for resurrecting central cities. It was Hispanic immigrants, he said, who rebuilt the housing in places like Dallas\u2019s Oak Cliff neighborhood, and who revived the commercial district in Chicago\u2019s Little Village (making such places more desirable to everyone else).\n\nThe \u201ccreative class\u201d itself depends on immigrants. They staff the restaurants, gyms, dry cleaners, florists, nail salons and cafes that have helped lure educated residents back to cities. They provide the child care that makes dual professional-parent households possible, and they carry out the renovations and housing construction that newly prosperous cities have seen.\n\nDuring much of this time, many city officials appear not to have understood what was happening, Sandoval-Strausz argues. They were focused on constructing highways, parking garages, new housing developments and indoor malls \u2014 suburban-style amenities to lure back white families who had moved away.", "description": "President Donald Trump has turned repeatedly throughout his tenure and his reelection campaign to two targets: immigrants whom he has described as \"invading\" the country, and U.S. cities he has called out of control.Through his language, the two are linked.
