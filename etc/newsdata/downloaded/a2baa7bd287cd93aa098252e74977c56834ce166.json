Elijah Cummings, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and Rep. Jerry Nadler, the chairman of Judiciary, sent a set of letters to the administration and related entities that lay out what they are looking for. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nNOTE TO THE WHITE HOUSE: THIS ISSUE IS NOT GOING AWAY \u2026 WIDESPREAD PROBE IS BEING LAUNCHED INTO WHITE HOUSE USE OF TRUMP HOTELS \u2026\n\nRep. ELIJAH CUMMINGS, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and Rep. JERRY NADLER, the chairman of Judiciary, have now launched a pretty deep investigation into VP MIKE PENCE\u2019S stay at Trump Doonbeg in Ireland, and President DONALD TRUMP\u2019S desire to host the G-7 at his resort in Miami.\n\nCUMMINGS AND NADLER sent a set of letters dated Thursday to the administration and related entities that lay out what they are looking for. They make clear that this probe is part of the committee\u2019s efforts to figure out if the president is abusing his office -- and, should Democrats decide to impeach the president, this would almost certainly be a part of it.\n\nTHIS MOST RECENT EPISODE CAME TO THE SURFACE BECAUSE MARC SHORT, the VP\u2019s chief of staff, said on the record that TRUMP told Pence\u2019s staff that they should stay in his hotel in Ireland. The VP\u2019s office later backtracked, saying this decision was made solely by the VP\u2019s office -- further complicating this issue, and, to some Democrats, giving a sniff of a cover-up.\n\nTHE IRELAND TRIP IS NOT the only thing in the crosshairs. The committees -- both of which are powerful and have subpoena power -- are also probing the president\u2019s stated desire to host the G-7 at his resort in Miami. Read Kyle Cheney for the full breakdown\n\nHERE ARE THE LETTERS \u2026 Nadler and Rep. Steve Cohen to White House counsel and Secret Service director \u2026 Cummings to Mick Mulvaney \u2026 Cummings to Short \u2026 Cummings to Secret Service director \u2026 Cummings to Alan Weisselberg at the Trump Organization\n\nREMEMBER THIS GOING INTO THE FALL \u2026 There\u2019s a multi-faceted divide in the Democratic caucus right now, but it can easily be broken down like this: From what we can tell, most every Democrat wants to impeach Trump. For the most part, those who are not publicly saying they support impeachment believe the politics do not break in the Democrats\u2019 favor. Few Dems these days oppose impeachment on the merits.\n\nANY INVESTIGATION INTO THE PRESIDENT -- and especially this probe, which involves the potential of the president profiting off government with the assistance of other White House figures -- is going to be center stage on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u2026 TO WIT: CNN\u2019S MANU RAJU and JEREMY HERB: \u201cDemocrats widen impeachment probe as they confront roadblocks\u201d: \u201cWith Congress reconvening next week after its summer recess, the [House Judiciary] committee is expanding its focus beyond Mueller\u2019s findings that Trump may have obstructed justice by seeking to undercut the investigation into his campaign and actions as President, an area that has dominated the panel's focus up until now.\n\n\u201cAs they head into a critical fall session, Democrats say they will also focus heavily on questions over whether the president is enriching himself while violating the emoluments clause in the Constitution, reports Trump dangled pardons to officials who were at risk of breaking immigration laws and his involvement in hush-money payments to over his alleged extramarital affairs -- all of which could form articles of impeachment against the president, according to lawmakers and aides involved in the effort.\u201d CNN\n\nHappy Friday afternoon.\n\nA message from The Boeing Company: \u201cThere\u2019s some familiarity here that makes you comfortable,\u201d says Nicole Canada, one of 20,000+ veterans using military experience and leadership skills to strengthen our team every day.

You served as our U.S. representative here in the fourth district for several years, and I know you know what\u2019s on the top of people\u2019s news agenda today for some folks, and they\u2019re talking about you running for the U.S. Senate, about Pat Roberts is going to not run this next time around. And I know you\u2019ve -- I\u2019m going to give you a chance. Just tell us right now. I know you -- what day you\u2019re going to kick off your campaign and who\u2019s going to be your campaign manager and so forth. Go ahead.\n\nPOMPEO: \u201cSteve, that\u2019s why I always love coming on your show. Look, I\u2019m focused on my mission. I\u2019m serving America and working on President Trump\u2019s team to deliver America\u2019s foreign policy. That\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on. I do see the noise. I\u2019m flattered when people say, \u2018Mike will be a good United States senator representing Kansas.\u2019 Susan and I love this place. We miss our Shockers. We miss our church there in Wichita and all our family and friends. But I\u2019m doing something that I consider an incredible privilege, an opportunity of a lifetime to lead the State Department, and I\u2019m focused on doing that each and every day.\n\nQUESTION: \u201cOK. So you don\u2019t really have to make a decision \u2018til next June, so I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019ll ask you again next week. How\u2019s that?\u201d POMPEO: \u201cFair enough, Steve.\u201d\n\n-- TAKE NOTE: This has gone from a no to a non-answer.\n\nA MISS \u2026 JOBS REPORT -- \u201cU.S. added a modest 130,000 jobs in August amid trade war,\u201d by AP\u2019s Christopher Rugaber: \u201cThe job gain was boosted by the temporary hiring of 25,000 government workers for the 2020 Census. \u2026 The Labor Department reported Friday in its monthly jobs report that the unemployment rate remained 3.7%, near the lowest level in five decades. The jobless rate was flat for a positive reason, though: Americans surged into the workforce \u2026\n\n\u201cAnd average hourly pay rose 3.2% from a year earlier, outpacing inflation and lifting Americans\u2019 spending power. \u2026 The rate of job creation is significant because at a time when the economy has been slowing, additional steady hiring \u2014 and higher pay \u2014 can continue to fuel consumer spending, the primary driver of growth. \u2026 For now, Americans are still spending and keeping the economy moving. \u2026 The unemployment rate for African-Americans fell to 5.5%, a record low.\u201d AP\n\nMAGGIE AND JMART EXPLAIN TRUMP\u2019S HESITATION ON GUN CONTROL \u2026 NYT: \u201cPresident Trump assured Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, on Thursday that he was still considering legislation that could include background checks for gun buyers. But White House aides said they had polling data showing that gun control was politically problematic for the president, according to two people briefed on the meeting.\u201d NYT\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

Outer Banks with 95 mph winds, charges toward southeast Va., southeast New England,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Jason Samenow and Andrew Freedman\n\nWHEN NETANYAHUS EXPLODE \u2026 HAARETZ: \u201cMiriam Adelson: \u2018Sara Netanyahu Told Me if Iran Wipes Out Israel, It Would Be My Fault\u2019\u201d: \u201cThe publisher of the daily Israel Hayom told the police that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife repeatedly contacted her about their coverage in the paper, Channel 12 News reported Thursday. Miriam Adelson said that Sara Netanyahu \u2018once told me that if Iran gets nuclear weapons and Israel is wiped out, I\u2019ll be to blame, because I\u2019m not defending Bibi,\u2019 referring to Netanyahu by his nickname.\n\n\u201cAdelson\u2019s statement was part of the police investigation into the deal Netanyahu allegedly negotiated with Yedioth Ahronoth publisher Arnon Mozes for favorable coverage in exchange for steps the prime minister would take to undermine Israel Hayom, its main rival. The deal was never consummated. Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit has decided to charge Netanyahu with fraud and breach of trust in this case, subject to a hearing.\n\n\u201cInitially, Adelson said, Sara Netanyahu treated her and her husband, Sheldon Adelson, nicely. But as time passed, \u2018there were only complaints.\u2019 For instance, \u2018Her picture was too small. They didn\u2019t write something [when] she visited some children with cancer or something. Complaints all the time. All the time. And it started to be unpleasant. We would listen; we\u2019d hear it and not respond.\u2019\u201d Haaretz\n\nWHAT\u2019S ON THE PRESIDENT\u2019S MIND -- @realDonaldTrump at 8:08 a.m.: \u201cPresident Obama never had the legal right to sign DACA, and he indicated so at the time of signing. But In any event, how can he have the right to sign and I don\u2019t have the right to \u2018unsigned.\u2019 Totally illegal document which would actually give the President new powers.\u201d\n\n\u2026 at 8:20 a.m.: \u201cDACA will be going before the Supreme Court. It is a document that even President Obama didn\u2019t feel he had the legal right to sign - he signed it anyway! Rest assured that if the SC does what all say it must, based on the law, a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all!\u201d\n\n2020 WATCH -- REMEMBER THIS GUY? \u2026 \u201cFormer Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz announces he will not run for president,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Greg Jaffe and Michael Scherer: \u201cFormer Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz formally abandoned his pursuit of an independent campaign for president Friday, telling his supporters in a letter that he found it tougher than he expected to capture the attention of moderate voters and that he didn\u2019t want to risk reelecting President Trump. Schultz\u2019s decision, after spending months away from public life because of health issues, will come as a relief to Democratic leaders.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- REALITY CHECK: Schultz has not been campaigning for some time. He doesn\u2019t have a staff. He never filed papers with the FEC or a financial disclosure. He wasn\u2019t running for president.\n\n-- NYT\u2019S MATT STEVENS in Plaistow, N.H.: \u201cAndrew Yang\u2019s Quest to \u2018Make America Think Harder\u2019\u201d: \u201cHe is far from the only one with policy chops. And he is, as ever, a long shot \u2026 But voters who attended his campaign events during a swing through New Hampshire last month rarely described him as a futurist fringe-candidate pitching a pie-in-the-sky plan. Instead, many said they had come to regard him as a smart, substantive and affable political outsider offering a thoughtful solution to an existential problem that other candidates have largely ignored.\n\n\u201cMore broadly, Mr. Yang\u2019s supporters said they found his almost apolitical approach refreshing. Rather than participate in daily brinkmanship over immigration and gun control or level attacks on President Trump, Mr. Yang has used his platform to gently lecture the country about the \u2018fourth industrial revolution\u2019 \u2026 The campaign is now on track to raise more than $5.5 million in the third quarter of the year. \u2026 A spokesman for Mr. Yang said the candidate would release his tax returns in the coming days. He declined to disclose Mr. Yang\u2019s net worth or comment on his paid speeches.\u201d NYT\n\n-- \u201cMeet the Democrats\u2019 Most Dangerous Digital Strategist,\u201d by Ozy\u2019s Nick Fouriezos: \u201cTara McGowan, a weapon of a woman whose innovative tactics make her critically important to the Democratic Party \u2026 and the biggest threat to the orthodoxy that has made so many left-leaning digital gurus rich in the post-Obama era. \u2026 [Her firm] Acronym has taken hardly any time in breaking the strategy-firm ecosystem in the nation\u2019s capital. By the end of 2018, it had raised and managed more than $18 million, registered 60,000 voters, run 105 targeted ad campaigns in 15 states, helped elect 63 progressive candidates and won 61 percent of the races it invested in. \u2026\n\n\u201cWhile most digital experts specialize in one tactic, the coordinated campaigns built by McGowan bring all the moving parts \u2014 from door-knocking and social media campaigns to digital videos and television ads \u2014 under one umbrella. \u2026 While the numbers are impressive, what could upend Washington politics entirely is the structure of her organization. Unlike most digital strategists, her operation is what the IRS classifies as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit \u2014 meaning a majority of its funds must be used to promote \u2018social welfare.\u2019 And yet, Acronym has a web of for-profit companies beneath it.\u201d Ozy\n\n-- WOW: \u201c\u2018The Most Immoral, Unethical Thing I\u2019ve Ever Seen In My 15 Years Of Politics\u2019 \u2014 Inside A Small City Mayor\u2019s Campaign For President: Wayne Messam\u2019s unlikely 2020 campaign has been chaotic from the start. \u2018It\u2019s like we were in some D-list version of The Sopranos,\u2019\u201d by BuzzFeed\u2019s Ryan Brooks and Diya Amlani\n\n-- PAGING ELISE STEFANIK \u2026 HUFFPOST\u2019S MOLLY REDDEN: \u201cRosemary Becchi is exactly who the Republican Party says it\u2019s looking for. Becchi \u2026 is running for one of the House seats Democrats snapped up in the blue wave of 2018 and that Republicans are eager to snatch back in 2020. She is a white-collar professional and a mother of three in a wealthy, white suburb where a lot of swing voters share her same background \u2014 the kind of woman Republicans say they are desperate to recruit, to speak to the voters they are desperate to win back.\n\n\u201cBut when Becchi met with a party official at National Republican Congressional Committee headquarters in Washington, he asked her not to run. NRCC officials already preferred another Republican in her New Jersey district, he said: Tom Kean Jr., the son of that state\u2019s popular former governor from the \u201980s. \u2026 Becchi\u2019s clash with the party \u2026 cuts to a more elemental problem: If Republicans want to elect more women, they\u2019ll have to elect fewer men.\u201d HuffPost\n\nVALLEY TALK -- \u201cStates to Launch Google, Facebook Antitrust Probes,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s John McKinnon: \u201cThe Google probe is expected to be announced at a news conference outside the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, with a bipartisan group of about three dozen state attorneys general joining the effort \u2026 The investigation will be led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican \u2026\n\n\u201cSeparately, an overlapping bipartisan group of attorneys general led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, is organizing a probe into social media company Facebook.\u201d WSJ\n\nMORE TRUST-BUSTING -- \u201cJustice Department Launches Antitrust Probe Into Four Auto Makers,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Timothy Puko: \u201cJustice Department lawyers are seeking to determine if Ford Motor Co., Honda Motor Co., BMW AG and Volkswagen AG violated federal competition law by agreeing with each other to follow tailpipe-emissions standards beyond those proposed by the Trump administration \u2026 The new antitrust inquiry by the Justice Department stands to escalate tensions between Washington, Sacramento and the auto industry over plans by the Trump administration to roll back clean-air mandates on auto makers.\u201d WSJ\n\nBIG IF TRUE -- \u201cDonald Trump Has Never Explained a Mysterious $50 Million Loan.
