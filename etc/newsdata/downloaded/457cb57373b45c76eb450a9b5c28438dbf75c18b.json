His head was physically misshapen. He was inconsolable.\u2019\n\nJake\u2019s horrific injuries (Picture: BPM)\n\nThe bullies were expelled from de Ferrers Academy in Burton, Staffordshire, but Jake, now 14, still suffers the consequences.\n\nDiane said: \u2018He had PTSD and a mental breakdown and was off school for three months. I wasn\u2019t letting him go back there.\n\n\u2018He tried to kill himself when he was 11. He was reliving it in his sleep, crying and begging for help \u2013 it was just heartbreaking to see.\n\n\u2018Jake is autistic, so it is hard for him to communicate the way he is feeling, but after two years of counselling he is still not right.\n\n\u2018He has really bad anxiety and he is scarred for life, with scars on his face, shoulder and knee.\u2019\n\nThe teenager struggles to go out on his own and doesn\u2019t like to be around big groups of people, his mother said.\n\nJake\u2019s mum Diane Warfield is fronting a campaign to stop bullying (Picture: BPM)\n\nMum-of-four Diane has joined forces with the parents of other children who have been bullied to share Jake\u2019s story in the hope laws will be introduced that stop bullying.\n\nShe said: \u2018It was nearly three years ago, but it has changed our lives completely.\n\n\u2018It is still going on in schools everywhere up and down the country and we want to stop others from going through what we have been through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018People are taking their lives because of bullies. It is not acceptable. It is unbelievable what bullying has done to Jake.\u2019\n\nThe campaign will be launched on 25 October by Jason Barnett from Leeds, an advocate for vulnerable children and a former teacher.\n\nMore than 75 families from across the UK are backing the campaign \u2013 including relatives who have set up foundations in memory of children who have lost their lives as a result of bullying.\n\nA spokesman for the de Ferrers Academy said: \u2018The academy has a range of strategies in place to minimise bullying and clear procedures to address it should it occur.\n\nThe school has introduced new safeguarding practices since Jake\u2019s attack in 2016 (Picture: Google)\n\n\u2018As part of our safeguarding review with the local authority, we have also introduced an email student helpline for bullying which guarantees a response within the day.\n\n\u2018All bullying incidents are recorded and reported to the local governing body.\u2019\n\nThe school said its anti-bullying policy is updated annually and that students attend and undertake anti-bullying assemblies throughout the year.\n\nThe spokesman added: \u2018It is deeply regrettable that this incident happened; support was put into place to support Jake in his transition to his new school and we are so sorry that he has been unwell.\n\n\u2018The de Ferrers Academy supports anti-bullying initiatives and we wish Jake and his family great success with their work in this regard.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
