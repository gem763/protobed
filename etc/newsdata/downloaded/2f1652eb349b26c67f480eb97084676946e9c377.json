(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nA crowd gathered on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, waving tiny American flags as they waited for Melania Trump to ring the opening bell Monday in celebration of her Be Best campaign. The first lady, who was in town for President Trump\u2019s address on Tuesday to the General Assembly of the United Nations, was greeted by cheers and applause as she marched through the aisles of lights and numbers as if it were a catwalk of yore, in a black, belted Prada dress.\n\nMeanwhile, a few blocks away, a small group of protesters stood at the famed Wall Street bull statue, carrying signs that read, \u201cKids Are Not Props,\u201d and a chalkboard with the repeating line, \u201cTeacher said don\u2019t lie, don\u2019t bully. Teacher said don\u2019t lie, don\u2019t bully.\u201d They were parents of children at the United Nations International School (UNIS), furious that the private school allowed a select group of third- and fourth-graders to appear at the stock exchange for a photo op with the first lady.\n\nAt her appearance, the day before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would announce an impeachment inquiry of her husband, the first lady spoke only to the NYSE president and the children, a magnificently diverse representation of New York City\u2019s melting pot in headbands, tulle party dresses and adorable tiny suits and bow ties. Bright and talkative, with last names ranging from Shakdher to Fang, they could have walked straight off the set of \u201cHoney, I Shrunk the UN Security Council.\u201d\n\nAs adults buzzed around the first lady like mosquitoes armed with camera flashes and boom mics, she asked the children their names and ages and spoke affirmations in soft, sweet tones: \u201cFollow your dreams, and be best at what you do.\u201d\n\nThe Be Best logo was projected behind her, blazing from screens above the stock exchange floor, on tote bags filled with further Be Best swag handed out to each kid. (A hat, a T-shirt, and, to one boy\u2019s great delight, a mouse pad.)\n\nThis was supposed to be an educational trip about the stock exchange. \u201cWhat did you learn?\u201d she asked the kids.\n\n\u201cWe ate breakfast,\u201d said Joey Ramos, who was charged with reading the UNIS mission statement. A little girl, Elena Moon, followed him, reading aloud a handwritten letter explaining what UNIS meant to her: \u201cWe like to tell people to be kind. Please help UNIS spread the mission of love around the world.\u201d\n\nIn the hour she was there, the first lady took no questions from members of the media, who could hear only bits of what she was saying. This has become routine for Melania Trump\u2019s relatively busy month, where she\u2019s been making an increasing number of public appearances but saying very little or nothing at all.\n\nShe\u2019s been present \u2014 at the state dinner for Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison that President Trump said she planned, with her husband in a moment of silence on the White House lawn on Sept 11. She\u2019ll be photographed standing, often surrounded by children, often impeccably dressed, but what does she stand for?\n\n\u201cI see it as a test run for the 2020 campaign,\u201d says Lisa M. Burns, a professor of media studies at Quinnipiac University. \u201cShe needs to be out there doing some things during the campaign, and it seems like, especially with this recent spate of activity, they\u2019re really kind of testing the waters.\u201d\n\nMelania Trump\u2019s last round on the campaign trail flamed out in 2016 after allegations that her Republican National Convention speech was plagiarized from Michelle Obama. In 2018, she took a pass on joining her husband as he traversed the country making a final push for Republican candidates during the midterm election. But this June, there she was, introducing her husband at his first 2020 reelection campaign rally in Orlando, standing out in unmissable head-to-toe bright yellow.\n\nAs Burns and others who follow the first lady\u2019s schedule explain it, this period of time \u2014 three months before the Iowa caucuses, with the shadow of the Mueller report no longer looming \u2014 is as good a time as any for her to get some practice under her belt. (The knock she took for that infamous \u201cI Really Don\u2019t Care. Do U?\u201d jacket she wore on her way to visit migrant children detained at the border seems to be fading.) A June 2018 Quinnipiac poll showed her as far more popular than most other major players in the Trump administration, including Vice President Pence. And according to a March 2019 Economist-YouGov poll, Melania Trump\u2019s favorability rating beat that of every other member of the Trump family.\n\n\u201cUnlike Ivanka Trump, Melania Trump is not seen as as much of a divisive figure because she didn\u2019t take an official job in the administration,\u201d says Lauren A. Wright, an associate research scholar in politics and public affairs at Princeton University. \u201cJust by separating herself from other White House staff members, which Ivanka has not done, she has reserved a little bit of that apolitical capital.\u201d\n\n[Fashion Critic\u2019s Perspective | At second state dinner, Melania Trump\u2019s dress is as quiet and dutiful as she]\n\nBeing more present, though, is not without risks. The Monday morning she rang the stock exchange bell, the Dow fell 10 points, dogged by concerns about the lack of progress on trade talks between the United States and China. Impeachment talk over her husband's dealings with Ukraine was lingering. His address to the United Nations would be a bold return to the event where, last year, world leaders burst out laughing when he bragged that his administration had done more in two years than \"almost any administration\" in American history.\n\nAnd then there were those angry UNIS parents. \u201cShe happens to be the representative of the Trump administration, whose modus operandi is lying and bullying, two of the biggest, most basic lessons we teach children to avoid in life,\u201d said Adam Pincus, whose daughter is in UNIS kindergarten.\n\nTheir objections were varied and not in\u00adcred\u00adibly unified, though. A flier they passed out said they\u2019d welcome the first lady\u2019s visit if it were at the school and no cameras were present. Another parent, who asked not to be identified because she\u2019s already been attacked by \u201cTrump trolls,\u201d said she would have protested a photo op with Michelle Obama at the stock exchange, too. But, she added, \u201cit makes me extra-angry that it\u2019s Melania. Every family at the school was [protesting the immigration bans] at JFK or Battery Park. We have Syrian kids, Iraqi kids, Iranian kids, trans kids. This runs deep for us.\u201d\n\nBut while that parent felt sure that the first lady\u2019s NYSE appearance was a ploy to project an image of strength at a time of economic uncertainty, it\u2019s not clear that anyone in the administration was thinking that far ahead.\n\n\n\nTrump rings the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. The first lady appeared at the stock exchange to promote her \u201cBe Best\u201d anti-bullying initiative and was joined by students from the United Nations International School.

(Antonia Gugala)\n\nThe interesting part to scholars is that she does seem to be in an uptick of activity compared with her first year in the role. The question is, why?\n\n\u201cFor those of us who follow the first lady, it\u2019s been harder [than with previous first ladies] to really assess what Mrs. Trump is doing,\u201d says Myra Gutin, professor of communication at Rider University. \u201cThere\u2019s sometimes no rhyme or reason to it.\u201d\n\nWright, the Princeton scholar, cites a study she did that shows that Melania Trump made eight speeches in 2017, as opposed to Michelle Obama\u2019s 74 and Laura Bush\u2019s 42 in their first years.\n\n\u201cIn recent times, she would qualify as probably the least active first lady since Bess Truman,\u201d Burns says, \u201cso that\u2019s going back to the \u201940s or \u201950s.\u201d (Truman spent most of her husband\u2019s presidency living in Missouri.)\n\nAnd with so few words spoken, and so few appearances made, every time she steps out her door becomes a news event. A Melania picture says a thousand words, whether she likes it or not, because a picture is all she\u2019ll give.\n\n\n\nTrump speaks briefly at a state dinner at the White House, thanking the guests and, in particular, the musicians.

(Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSlowly but surely Melania Trump has been toe-dipping into more of the ceremonial events that traditionally fall to first ladies, Wright says. (According to her Instagram account, she started prepping White House Christmas decorations in July.) It\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s learning to get over her media aversion by treating her role as a four-year red carpet. Speaking events might have been sweet spots for lawyers-by-training Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama, or former librarian Laura Bush, but photo-ops are Melania Trump\u2019s comfort zone, as a former model and non-native English speaker. Baby step, baby step, pose, platitude; baby step, baby step, pose, platitude.\n\nHostess at the state dinner in a flowing sea green gown. Giving short, prepared remarks at the opening of the Kennedy Center\u2019s Reach expansion, even though she and her husband have skipped the typical presidential appearances at the Kennedy Center Honors because too many honorees threatened to boycott if the president attended.\n\nFar more careful on social media than her husband, the first lady even recently tweeted about the dangers of flavored e-cigarettes. Though she hasn\u2019t spoken publicly about the issue, she did sit in the Oval Office nodding along in a news conference as President Trump vowed to ban them. (And spoke for her in such a way \u2014 \u201cShe has a son, together\u201d \u2014 that made it sound like he\u2019d momentarily forgotten their 13-year-old Barron is his son, too.)\n\nThe rare policy stance earned praise from Meredith Berkman, co-founder of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to think that there is a Momvocate in chief who really cares and understands that this is not a partisan, political issue.\u201d\n\nYet, even speaking out on behalf of children is complicated for this first lady. While the Trumps were preparing for the state dinner, elsewhere in Washington, thousands of children and teens were skipping school to march on Capitol Hill. \u201cYou will die of old age,\u201d they chanted. \u201cI will die of climate change.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump would go on to tweet sarcastically about 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg\u2019s address to the U.N. climate summit.\n\nMelania Trump tried to cut the ribbon to reopen the Washington Monument after a 3\u00bd -year closure for repairs, but the ribbon would not cooperate. Really, this was a matter of too many scissors rather than any lack of ribbon-cutting know-how on the first lady's part. As referees reviewing the tape would see, she'd waited patiently as cute fourth-graders from Amidon-Bowen Elementary, a public school in Southwest Washington with an overwhelming majority of black students, counted backward from five.\n\nBut the people with scissors to her right and to her left either jumped the gun or cut faster. The red, white and blue ribbon that park rangers had arranged so carefully deflated like a punctured balloon. Several feet of it got caught on the first lady\u2019s scissors, flailing in the breeze. The situation had gone from tension to not enough tension to a different kind of tension altogether.\n\nSome might have laughed off the incident with a joke. (Photo-ops go wrong. Like that pith helmet she wore on her Africa trip last year. Or those stilettos and $4,000 skirt she wore to plant a tree. Or that infamous jacket.) She seemed perplexed, before handing off the flailing ribbon and plastering on a smile.\n\n\u201cI think there have been some very unfair critiques of her lack of public activity,\u201d says Wright, pointing out that the job is not even a job. It\u2019s unpaid, unofficial, and not mentioned in the Constitution. \u201cThere\u2019s no requirement that she sets aside her life and just turns into a full-time advocate for her husband.\u201d\n\nBurns has studied every first lady of the 20th century and says that, with the exception of Nellie Taft, none of them wanted the job. She likes that Melania Trump is not performing the role according to any previous template.\n\n\u201cI certainly think that when we get the first man in this position, we\u2019re going to see a lot of, \u2018Oh, well, he doesn\u2019t have to worry about state dinners. We don\u2019t want him picking china patterns.\u2019 Why not? Who said these women had any interest in china patterns? But we still said they should do it.\u201d\n\nRichard Morgan contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow Melania Trump marked the first anniversary of Be Best\n\nMelania Trump\u2019s parents would have struggled to come to the U.S. under Trump\u2019s immigration plan\n\nStephanie Grisham was Melania Trump\u2019s press secretary.
