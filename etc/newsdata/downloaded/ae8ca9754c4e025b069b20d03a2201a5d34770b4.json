I think I saw her in a commercial a couple of times.\n\nI do not know much about her, except that she is a very successful and popular person.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRecently, she sat beside President George W. Bush at an NFL game.\n\nSupposedly they engaged in casual banter \u2014 about the game, one presumes.\n\nFor doing this \u2014 for sitting beside the former President of the United States \u2014 she was attacked and vilified by some members of the Hollywood glitterati.\n\nThe attacks seemed especially ad hominem. She was charged by some of her movie town peers for talking to a \u201cwar criminal.\u201d\n\nThis is a harsh charge even by the low standards of Hollywood\u2019s elite.\n\nHer response, however, was disarming and appropriate.\n\nShe simply said let\u2019s \"be kind to one another.\u201d\n\nHow long has it been since we heard a leading light of the liberal establishment say something so needed, rational and upbeat?\n\nThe use of the term \u201cwar criminal\u201d is an inexcusably defaming phrase for any American to subscribe to in referring to a former president. This is especially true in the case of George W. Bush.\n\nPresident Bush, also known as 43, came into office with the aim of bringing the country together under the banner of compassionate conservatism.\n\nIn his first nine months, he made considerable progress. He moved to reform education to leave no child behind. He reinvigorated the economy with tax relief for most Americans. He pushed to deal with illegal immigrants in a humane and positive way.\n\nThen, America was attacked.\n\nThe terrorist strikes of September 11, 2001 were the worse carnage seen on our soil since Pearl Harbor.\n\nWe were at war. President Bush became a wartime president for the rest of his term.\n\nThe issue was survival \u2014 keeping our nation and our people safe.\n\nHis spontaneous words, standing atop the burning rubble of to the World Trade Center, galvanized us:\n\n\u201cI hear you, the rest of the world hears you and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\"\n\nHis decision to throw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium was not only an act of personal bravery but a clear statement to the nation that we were going to handle this attack with the grace, courage and purpose that is at the center of our character.\n\nWere mistakes made? Yes, they always are when war is involved. Some were costly and tragic.\n\nBut since 9/11, America has not been attacked again \u2014 in large part because of the leadership and clarity that Bush displayed.\n\nThat is the true test of his policies. They worked, because they protected our country.\n\nIt is ironic that people who profit from movies and video games that promote excessive violence, like Avatar, deem themselves qualified to judge a former President of the United States with such viciousness and vindictiveness.\n\nIt is not only the liberal establishment that has gone off the deep end in its rhetoric of anger and debasement, but also President Trump Donald John Trump'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Kayla Mueller's mother: Daughter might still be alive 'If Obama had been as decisive' as Trump MORE.\n\nThe president revels in using the lowest form of demeaning discourse, in language and imagery, when it comes to attacking others.\n\nHe has now made it almost a signature of his style to call people names and use words best left, if used at all, in a men\u2019s locker room.\n\nHe believes that by using of the tone of a Howard Stern show he shows his willingness to transgress the normal boundaries that govern presidential behavior.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe seems to believe that he is fulfilling his campaign promise to be different. He is asserting that he is a person who is guided only by his own rules.\n\nOf course when one uses simplistic, tasteless language it becomes difficult to elevate the nation \u2014 or for that matter to make parents feel they can allow their children to listen to their president.\n\nThe language of social media has also become peppered with pejoratives and baseness.\n\nIt is a race to the bottom to see who, whether on the marginal right or the marginal left, can shout the loudest and most outrageously.\n\nThe collapse in what used to be called decorum is bad for the nation.\n\nOur country requires respect for different views in order to facilitate compromise and good governance.\n\nOur system of government requires accommodation. This cannot occur if there is no civility.\n\nI suspect that, as a conservative, my political views are distinctly different from those of Ellen DeGeneres. But I immensely respect her willingness to set the correct tone in her response to those who attacked her.\n\nIt is at least the second time she has stood her ground well.\n\nThe first was when she stated her sexual preference at a time when such a proclamation carried considerable potential risk to her career.\n\nNow, one hopes her call for tolerance of other views will also be accepted.\n\nMaybe it will even help generate a general groundswell of decency in our political dialogue.\n\nShe does after all have a very large following.\n\nThank you, Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nYou have reminded many Americans of how important the strength of civility is to our nation\u2019s success.\n\nJudd Gregg (R) is a former governor and three-term senator from New Hampshire who served as chairman and ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, and as ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Foreign Operations subcommittee.", "description": "OPINION: The talk show host showed the way forward in terms of civility.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bushgw-degeneresellen-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
