The 38 are current and former state department officials but were not identified.\n\nWhile there were no findings of deliberate mishandling of classified information, the report made clear that Clinton\u2019s use of the private email while serving as the secretary of state in the Obama administration had increased the vulnerability of classified information.\n\nRussians tried to hack Clinton server on day Trump urged email search Read more\n\nThe Associated Press sent an email seeking comment to a Clinton representative.\n\nThe investigation covered 33,000 emails that Clinton turned over for review after her use of the private email account became public. The department said it found a total of 588 violations involving information then or now deemed to be classified but could not assign fault in 497 cases.\n\nFor current and former officials, culpability means the violations will be noted in their files and will be considered when they apply for or go to renew security clearances. For current officials, there could also be some kind of disciplinary action. But it was not immediately clear what that would be.\n\nThe report concluded \u201cthat the use of a private email system to conduct official business added an increased degree of risk of compromise as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of state department networks\u201d.\n\nThe department began the review in 2016 after declaring 22 emails from Clinton\u2019s private server to be \u201ctop secret\u201d. Clinton was then running for president against Donald Trump, and Trump made the server a major focus of his campaign.\n\nJames Comey, the then-FBI director, held a news conference that year in which he criticized Clinton as \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her use of the private email server as secretary of state but said the FBI would not recommend charges.\n\nThe justice department\u2019s inspector general said FBI specialists did not find evidence that the server had been hacked, with one forensics agent saying he felt \u201cfairly confident that there wasn\u2019t an intrusion\u201d.\n\nGrassley started investigating Clinton\u2019s email server in 2017, when he was the chair of the Senate judiciary committee. The Iowa Republican has been critical of Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information and urged administrative sanctions.\n\nClinton has frequently lampooned the Republicans\u2019 ongoing obsession with her email controversy (\u201clock her up\u201d is still a popular chant at Trump rallies). An exhibit at the Venice Biennale in September saw her sitting behind a replica of the Oval Office\u2019s Resolute Desk and reading from the 62,000 pages of emails.", "description": "State department did find violations by 38 current and former department officials, some of whom may face disciplinary action", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2d1c12eb585c616b1ec52172a45ba85d0d92a11/0_45_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=14ee56c775e1f4b4cd776e17790cacaa", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
