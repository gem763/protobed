Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nThe Washington Post/Getty Images, FILE\n\nIt was just the latest in a long series of threats Trump has made against Iran, each followed by uncertainty over whether he would follow through with a military response.\n\nOn Monday, he did as he often does, and answered reporter questions about his intentions with \"We'll see what happens.\"\n\nHe came close to making good on this threats of military action in June, after Iran shot down an unarmed and unmanned U.S. RQ-4A Global Hawk drone flying in international airspace over the Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz. Trump tweeted that \"Iran made a very big mistake\" after a top Iranian commander warned Iran was \"ready for war.\"\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images, FILE\n\nBut he called off a military strike against Iran at the last-minute, placing the blame on someone \"loose and stupid\" in Iran -- an individual who had made a \"big mistake.\"\n\nFive days later and following the attack on two commercial tankers sailing in international waters in the Gulf of Oman, Trump escalated his threats against Iran, promising Iran would be met with \"great and overwhelming force\" and potential \"obliteration\" in some areas if it attacks \"anything American\" after Iranian leaders said the White House \"is afflicted by mental retardation\" and that they would be permanently close the door to diplomacy in the wake of U.S. sanctions.\n\nTrump called statements made by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and a spokesperson for Iran's foreign minister \"ignorant and insulting,\" and then issued another stark threat: \"Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.\"\n\n....Iran\u2019s very ignorant and insulting statement, put out today, only shows that they do not understand reality. Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration. No more John Kerry & Obama! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2019\n\nIn June 2018, after Trump announced he was formally pulling the U.S. out of the nuclear deal, he issued a threat to Iran after the country's president Hassan Rouhani said that pursuing hostilities against his country could lead to \"the mother of all wars.\"\n\nTrump tweeted in all-caps, \"To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.

Why?\" Pelosi asked. \"What is the purpose?
