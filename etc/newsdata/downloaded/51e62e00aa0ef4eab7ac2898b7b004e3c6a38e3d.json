Other options include curbing the ability of US government pension funds to buy Chinese equities.\n\nBeijing is preparing to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China with a national celebration next week and is due to have new trade talks with the US in October.\n\nA widening of the US-China economic conflict into the arena of capital markets has long been pushed by hawks in Washington, particularly Marco Rubio, the Republican senator from Florida, and like-minded officials within the administration. But it has been resisted by other Trump advisers who fear it could deal a fresh blow to markets and undermine investor confidence.\n\nThe idea prompted a pointed response from one of the largest US stock markets, Nasdaq, which said in a statement: \u201cOne critical quality of our capital markets is that we provide non-discriminatory and fair access to all eligible companies. The statutory obligation of all US equity exchanges to do so creates a vibrant market that provides diverse investment opportunities for US investors.\u201d\n\nThe US equity benchmark, the S &P 500, turned negative after news of the discussions was first reported by Bloomberg, ending Friday down 0.5 per cent. There was also a sharp fall in the shares of New York-listed Chinese companies and a weakening of the yuan.", "description": "A widening of the US-China economic conflict into the arena of capital markets has long been pushed by hawks in Washington.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1576%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/11f4c53fe90232abfba7082a83cf57754b21b2b7", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
