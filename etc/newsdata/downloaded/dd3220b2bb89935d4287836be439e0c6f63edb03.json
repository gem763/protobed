The downfall of Canada's brand", "language": "en", "text": "The coffee shop has long been synonymous with Canada, but bad press and changing tastes have hurt it \u2013 and then there was the poop incident\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your first time in Canada? Oh, you have to try Timmies,\u201d a former colleague informed me, when I landed in Toronto for a business trip several years ago. There was a Tim Hortons next to us in arrivals and before I\u2019d even exited the airport I had a red and white cup in my hand and knew exactly what a double-double was.\n\n\n\nTim Hortons is a famously Canadian brand. It\u2019s not just a corporation \u2013 it\u2019s a cultural icon which elicits an extraordinary passion, entirely incommensurate with its unremarkable product. (While talking to people for this article the highest praise anyone would give Tim Hortons coffee when it came to its quality was \u201cit\u2019s fine\u201d.) According to the coffee and fast-food chain, eight out of 10 cups of coffee sold across Canada are from Timmies.\n\nAmid Canada\u2019s housing crisis, to live in a coffee shop isn't all that unusual Read more\n\nBut while the popular purveyor of caffeinated patriotism may have burrowed its way into the national psyche, there are signs that it is beginning to lose its hold on Canadian hearts; not a week seems to go by without a new negative headline about Tim Hortons. In May, for example, the company fell from 13th place to 67th place in a study tracking Canada\u2019s most reputable companies. This was announced only a few weeks after Tim Hortons dropped from number four to 50 in an annual survey of corporate reputation by research firm Leger. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this study for 20 years and they\u2019ve been at the top 10 every year, except for once when they were number 13,\u201d Dave Scholz, the executive vice-president of Leger, told the Guardian.\n\nSholz attributes much of this dip to a longstanding, and increasingly acrimonious, row between Tim Hortons franchisees and the relatively new parent company, Restaurant Brands International (RBI), which was formed in 2014 when Burger King merged with the coffee chain. RBI is majority-owned by the Brazilian investment company 3G Capital but the fact that Tim Hortons was no longer properly Canadian needn\u2019t have been a problem. Indeed, Timmies was owned by the American company Wendy\u2019s for years, before regaining independence and restructuring as a Canadian public company in 2009. What mattered is that since RBI took over, Tim Hortons has been perceived to be acting in a way that seems antithetical to Canadian values. Many store owners have been unhappy about what they see as self-serving measures by the parent company to increase its margins as the franchisees\u2019 expense.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Santa Claus parade in Toronto. \u2018The company has cultivated Canadiana through its marketing.\u2019 Photograph: Roberto Machado Noa/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nAnother contributing factor, Scholz notes, is the rancor between franchisees and employees, sparked by Ontario significantly raising its minimum wage earlier this year. At first, RBI refused to let Tim Hortons franchisees pass on the costs by raising prices so some store owners cut paid breaks and benefits. These franchisees notably included Jeri-Lynn Horton-Joyce (Tim Horton\u2019s daughter) and her husband Ron Joyce Jr (the son of Ron Joyce, co-founder of the chain); the couple made national news after axing benefits, a move they blamed on \u201cthe lack of assistance and financial help from our head office and from the government\u201d. Employees were vocally unimpressed by this \u2013 as was the premier of Ontario, who called the benefit reductions a \u201cclear act of bullying\u201d.\n\nWhat makes Tim Hortons Canadian? Is it the fact that the coffee is quite bland? Chris Lloyd\n\nNot only has the very public rowing between the Tim Hortons parent company, franchisees and employees hurt the brand\u2019s reputation, it has hurt sales. In an April earnings call, Daniel Schwartz, the CEO of RBI, told investors that Tim Hortons same-store sales (an important retail metric that tracks sales at locations that have been open for a year or more) had fallen for the eighth consecutive quarter. While this is partly due to increased competition from the likes of McDonald\u2019s and millennials opting for more artisanal food and drink options (there\u2019s certainly nothing artisanal about the processed cheese sandwiches at Timmies), it was also, said Schwartz, largely attributable to \u201cnegative media created by [a] group of franchisees\u201d.\n\nAnd then there was the poop incident. Last month, a woman defecated on the floor of a Tim Hortons and threw her feces at the cashier because she was angry he had denied her access to the bathroom. The incident was all caught on camera and the video was widely circulated online. While it may have been a one-off by an inordinately upset punter, the episode seemed to encapsulate the, well, shitshow, that is the Tim Hortons brand at the moment.\n\nThe making (and unmaking) of a Canadian brand\n\nIn order to really understand the downfall of Tim Hortons, you need to look at why it became so popular in the first place. How did such a seemingly unremarkable brand ignite such national passion?\n\nFirst, says Robert Mackalski, assistant professor of marketing at McGill University, there\u2019s its ubiquity. There are almost 4,000 Tim Hortons locations in Canada. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a coffee or donut occasion,\u201d Mackalski notes, \u201cthere\u2019s going to be a Tim Hortons.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that Tim Hortons \u201chas got Canada in its DNA\u201d. It was founded in 1964 by Miles \u201cTim\u201d Horton, one of Canada\u2019s most celebrated professional ice hockey players. \u201cOver the years,\u201d Mackalski explains, \u201cthe company has cultivated Canadiana through its marketing. It\u2019s involved in all the communities; it sponsors community hockey from coast to coast. When Canadians were involved in the Afghan war Tim Hortons opened up a coffee place on the military base for the soldiers overseas.\u201d Through strategic spokespeople like Sidney Crosby and canny marketing, Timmies has turned itself into an embodiment of Canadian values. \u201cIt\u2019s welcoming, it\u2019s down to earth, it has no pretensions, it\u2019s polite, it\u2019s courteous, it\u2019s Canada itself,\u201d says Mackalski.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robert Mackalski: \u2018When Canadians were involved in the Afghan war, Tim Hortons opened up on the base.\u2019 Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty\n\nNot everyone, it should be said, is thrilled with the way in which Tim Hortons has become synonymous with Canadian values. Chris Lloyd, an artist who lives in Montreal, and frequently critiques the company through his art, says he believes the brand \u201cperpetuates a homogenized view\u201d of a boring Canadian identity. \u201cIn an era where people are questioning what it means to have a national identity, what makes Tim Hortons Canadian?\u201d Lloyd asks. \u201cIs it the fact that the coffee is quite bland?\u201d Lloyd used to hang out at Timmies as a teenager and once even worked at one, but believes the blandness of the brand reflects badly on what it means to be Canadian.\n\nDespite the fact he may not have a taste for Timmies himself, Lloyd notes that one of the coffee chain\u2019s strengths is that \u201cyou see all sorts of people of all walks of life gravitate to it. It serves as a community center almost.\u201d It\u2019s the antithesis to fancy latte culture, a place where anyone can feel comfortable. Indeed, earlier this year a homeless man called Ted tragically died in a 24-hour Vancouver branch of Tim Hortons. He would come to the coffee shop every day for 10 years. It was a place where he blended in with the working-class clientele and felt at home.\n\nMake Tim Hortons great again\n\nDespite its current woes, Tim Hortons has built up an incredible store of equity and, even with its current woes, it\u2019s still a fixture in many Canadians\u2019 routines. \u201cI pass by three Tim Hortons on my way to work, every morning and there\u2019s always a line out of the door,\u201d notes Arnaud Doyon, a 28-year-old event producer from Montreal. \u201cEven though there\u2019s a fancy espresso machine in our office, people still go to Hortons and buy the crappy coffee there. It\u2019s like a ritual.\u201d\n\nInside Tuscan: the other no-fly list Canada didn't tell you about Read more\n\nSo, while Tim Hortons may be facing troubling times, all is not lost; the brand still has a chance to bounce back. \u201cI think they can still be an iconic Canadian company,\u201d Scholz says by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s such a big part of our culture. People go to the beach with a cup of Tim Hortons coffee. They\u2019re everywhere. We have about four in the small town where I live. Actually, I\u2019m drinking a Tim Hortons coffee right now.\u201d\n\nHowever, for Tim Hortons to regain its place in the Canadian psyche, it\u2019s going to need to focus a lot more on its home market, says Mackalski. \u201cThe ownership want to expand the brand internationally, but you\u2019ve always got to tend to the home base and make sure they\u2019re looked after. Given the recent scandals, maybe it\u2019s time to put a lot more attention on to the home front.\u201d\n\nMackalski also believes that Tim Hortons may have an unlikely savior in the US president, Donald Trump. \u201cThe recent banter between Trump and Trudeau is sparking a little bit of nationalism, so I think that could play quite well for Tim Hortons. Canadians are an interesting group, they don\u2019t go out there and loudly do a pledge of allegiance to Canada, but they do like to feel a part of the Canadian fabric. And a cup of Tim Hortons has always been there for that.\u201d Who knows, maybe Trump will succeed in making Tim Hortons great again.", "description": "The coffee shop has long been synonymous with Canada, but bad press and changing tastes have hurt it \u2013 and then there was the poop incident", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90eabb194140916bf857b3cccf808f6dd693706a/3_4_994_596/master/994.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=04de28780a80eee0cdde401fbabddebb", "published_at": "2018-07-09"}
