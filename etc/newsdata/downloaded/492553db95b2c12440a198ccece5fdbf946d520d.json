My colleague Robinson Meyer, who met with Thunberg in person last week, has a theory: It\u2019s all about her teenager-ness.\n\n\u201cShe can see the world through an \u2018adult\u201d moral lens,\u2019 he writes, \u201cand so she knows that the world is a heartbreakingly flawed place. But unlike an actual adult, she bears almost no conscious blame for this dismal state.\u201d You can read their full interview here.\n\nThe impact of climate activism is playing out in the 2020 Demcratic primary, where in stark contrast to past election cycles, just about every candidate Has a Plan\u2122 to try to stave off an impending environmental crisis.\n\nBut how much do voters actually care about addressing climate change? Let\u2019s look at some recent data:\n\nAccording to at least one poll, around 7 percent of voters chose climate change as the most important issue they\u2019re weighing in a candidate (far behind \u201cAbility to beat Donald Trump\u201d).\n\nThe one candidate who made his campaign front and center of his campaign, Washington Governor Jay Inslee, flamed out in August with just a whisper of support in most polls.\n\nActivists like Thunberg are on a crusade to get the world to take the climate seriously. At least in the U.S., getting politicians to spotlight climate-change policies can already be a difficult endeavor (though the 2020 Democratic primary has had a somewhat strong, if uneven, showing in this arena). Getting more voters to make climate change their number one is a whole lot harder.\n\n\u2014Saahil Desai\n\nWhat Else We\u2019re Watching\n\n(Leah Millis / Reuters)\n\nOn the unfolding Trump-Ukraine-Biden whistle-blower scandal: The setup of the American whistle-blower system has problems, Mike Giglio reports.\n\n+ \u201cIt is an astonishing admission, with the president saying he used his power to enlist a foreign government to help him win reelection,\u201d David A.
