Despite the match stopping twice, the England team played on.\n\nHere is a run down of exactly what happened in the match against Bulgaria:\n\n50 minutes before kick off: A masked group of Far Right hooligans - identifying themselves as Lauta Army, a firm linked to Lokomotiv Plovdiv - post a picture on their Facebook page. Two members of the group have their arms out straight in apparent Nazi salutes.\n\nMoments before kick-off: An announcement from the PA system had called for no discrimination from the fans. Two ends of the the Vasil Levski National Stadium had already been closed after Uefa imposed a partial ban because of racist behaviour from Bulgaria fans against Kosovo in June. Six Uefa banners were placed on one side of the stadium, which read \u201cEqual Game\u201d. Before the game.\n\nSeven minutes: Home fans cheered when Rashford was fouled and a bottle was thrown in his direction when he scored in the seventh minute.", "description": "As England's Euro 2020 qualifier was marred with abuse from Far Right Bulgarian hooligans, becoming a seminal moment for football's response to racism.", "authors": ["Tom Morgan", "Sports News Correspondent", "Paul Hayward", "Jason Burt", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000213035309-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqHqOpY7qqPpKt1o-ufeW-sZrnn_7rv46CFzjlu8ZiXXM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
