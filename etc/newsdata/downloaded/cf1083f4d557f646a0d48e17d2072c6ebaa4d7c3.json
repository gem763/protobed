Users simply upload details about the bag they\u2019re trying to sell including the designer, style, size, color, model and rate its condition on a scale from A, B, C or D. Then, Rebag\u2019s Clair tool will reveal the price the company will pay to buy it.\n\n\u201cWe call Hermes the unicorn, it projects over 80% of the resale value,\u201d Charles Gorra, the founder of Rebag, told FOX Business of the French fashion house that has a high return on investment. He says other designers like Chanel, Louie Vuitton and Gucci retain a value that\u2019s between 60 and 70%.\n\nThe tool is also meant for users to use before they invest in buying a new handbag, so they can see how much they\u2019ll get if they try to resell it. Gorra compares the tool to Kelley Blue Book, the company that reports the market value price for new and used cars and other vehicles like motorcycles and snowmobiles.\n\n\u201cYou would never buy a car without checking Kelley Bluebook first. It\u2019s the idea of the net price. It's what you\u2019re paying today, minus the value you\u2019re going to capture,\" Gorra said.\n\nA number of celebrities have invested in their handbag collections over the years. The leading ladies on \"Sex & The City\" toted around many of the handbag styles that have had a lucrative resurgence in recent months, like Carrie's famous Fendi Baguette bag, now worth more than $1,000 on the resale market, and the coveted red Birkin bag Samantha's character faked celebrity status to get.\n\nKylie Jenner, one of the world's youngest billionaires, has a closet dedicated to over a reported 400 handbags from designers like Chanel, Dior and limited edition Herm\u00e8s Birkins. She called them \"a great investment.\"\n\nIndeed, the U.S. resale market has grown 21 times faster in the U.S. compared to any other retail sector in the fashion industry in the past there years, according to GlobalData as reported by the Financial Times, which estimates the resale market is worth $24 billion and will increase to $51 billion by 2023.\n\nAnd more consignment websites have been capturing a piece of the market. The RealReal, gives buyers up to 90% off luxury brands. And Poshmark, a marketplace for used clothing, shoes and accessories, sells used designer handbags like the Louis Vuitton Speedy bag up for sale for $500 (the current cost is $1,070). Ebay, meanwhile, has one of the largest resale reaches in the world.\n\nHere\u2019s how to maximize the return on your handbag investment:\n\nTreat your handbag like a baby \u2013 take care of it.\n\nCondition is everything when it comes to maximizing the value of your purchase to make it attractive to the resale market, Gorra says. So try to avoid ware-and-tear as much as you can.\n\n\u201cThe more the bag is damaged, the less you\u2019re going to recapture,\u201d Gorra said.\n\nPackage it like it\u2019s brand new.\n\nDo your best to save the dust bag your purse came in along with the receipt, and tags you might have to show that the bag is authentic.\n\n\u201cI recommend keeping as much as you can -- the box [it came in], anything that makes it as close to looking like the new item,\u201d Gorra said.\n\nNORDSTROM FLAGSHIP BANKS ON LUXURY EXPERIENCE AMID RETAIL SLUMP\n\nTake photos and be transparent.\n\nProspective buyers want to know exactly what they\u2019re paying for and photos are crucial to driving the sale.\n\nTake photos of the handbag to get close up shots of the inside label, and capture every angle of the bag to show off the quality and condition.\n\n\u201cBe as accurate and transparent as possible. There is no upside in trying to select the wrong bag, overstate the condition or not show certain ware. Ultimately, once we receive the items we will make our final offer based on what we actually receive; you can\u2019t really game the system,\u201d Gorra said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "How to get a return on your luxury handbag investment.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/sex-and-the-city-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
