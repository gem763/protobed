I don\u2019t think he should listen to all this negativity,\" Whyte told IFLTV .\n\n\"That\u2019s all nonsense. He needs to do his thing and do what he does best. What he does best is to be strong and aggressive and be on the offensive. That\u2019s what he does.\n\n\"Ruiz clocked him with a good punch, behind the ear, and he didn\u2019t recover. It\u2019s boxing. Everyone gets put on their arse sooner or later. Now it\u2019s his turn.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"He just needs to listen. If he uses his jab more against Andy Ruiz he knocks him out. He just needs to jab more.\n\n\"Doubles, singles and triples and he knocks Ruiz out. Ruiz is a tough guy. If you hit him with a right hand he takes it.\n\n\"If you hit him with a couple of jabs, he doesn\u2019t see the right hand coming. Boom, that will be that.\n\n\"Let\u2019s be honest, Ruiz is a good fighter. He doesn\u2019t look it, but he\u2019s a good fighter. He\u2019s got quick hands but slow feet and that\u2019s why Joshua needs to use the jab.\"", "description": "Andy Ruiz shocked the heavyweight division in New York in June when he inflicted a first defeat on Anthony Joshua", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Pa", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20049699.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILE-PHOTO-Anthony-Joshua-v-Andy-Ruiz-Jr-WBA-Super-IBF-WBO-IBO-World-Heavyweight-Titles.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
