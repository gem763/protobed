(Although only 10 per cent of people with acid reflux will have Barrett\u2019s, 10 per cent of those will go on to develop oesophageal cancer.)\n\nFor Peter, hiccupping at bedtime, along with a sour taste in his mouth, had become a nightly nuisance.\n\n\u2018The attacks would happen several times a week, usually when I went to bed and lay down,\u2019 says Peter, 66, who is separated with two grown-up children.\n\n\u2018They would last for 15 minutes or sometimes longer. I couldn\u2019t get to sleep when I was hiccupping every few seconds. It became the bane of my life, but I didn\u2019t think it was anything sinister.\u2019\n\nPeter, a retired coach engineer from Gillingham, Kent, thought his indigestion was too trivial to bother the doctor with, and blamed it on his love of kebabs, toad-in-the-hole and full English breakfasts.\n\n\u2018My job sometimes involved being out on the road. I\u2019d grab food on the run and it would often be greasy and unhealthy,\u2019 he says. \u2018I tended to rush my food, too, so I thought I was probably swallowing too much air.\n\n\u2018I took over-the-counter heartburn pills such as Gaviscon and just blamed my bad eating habits.\u2019\n\n\u2018The attacks would happen several times a week, usually when I went to bed and lay down,\u2019 says Peter, 66, who is separated with two grown-up children (file image)\n\nAfter almost two decades of suffering, in 2016 Peter finally saw his GP, who advised him to avoid greasy food. \u2018I did cut back,\u2019 says Peter, \u2018but old habits are hard to change.\u2019\n\nAs a precaution, he was also sent for a gastroscopy, where a thin, flexible tube with a small camera on the end is put down the throat. This revealed he had a hiatus hernia, a common condition where part of the stomach is pushed up into the chest.\n\n\u2018I was told it was nothing to worry about, that I should try to lose some weight and it would correct itself,\u2019 says Peter, who was only slightly overweight.\n\nHe adds: \u2018I carried on taking heartburn pills, but the hiccupping and acid reflux continued. Then in February 2017, after suffering some breathlessness unrelated to my indigestion, I was sent for a CT scan, which picked up a shadow on my oesophagus.\n\n\u2018Another gastroscopy and some blood tests followed and this time it was bad news \u2014 I was told I had early stage oesophageal cancer affecting a few centimetres of the lining of my oesophagus. I was stunned.\u2019\n\nPeter was told the cancer had been caused by Barrett\u2019s oesophagus \u2014 where, over time, stomach acid splashes up and damages the lining of the oesophagus.\n\n\u2018I was later told that my hiatus hernia lay directly below my oesophagus and was pushing up on it,\u2019 he says. \u2018This caused my diaphragm to go into spasm and triggered my hiccups.\u2019\n\nAs well as chronic hiccups, the risk factors for Barrett\u2019s include burping, acid reflux and an unpleasant taste in the mouth. It is not known why some people with persistent acid reflux develop Barrett\u2019s and others don\u2019t, although the condition is most common in middle-aged men who are obese \u2014 this may be related to men being more likely to put on weight around the middle, which, in turn, increases the likelihood of a hiatus hernia and Barrett\u2019s.\n\nDoctors are also seeing much younger people with Barrett\u2019s \u2014probably because obesity is becoming more common.\n\nPeter\u2019s cancer was diagnosed early and he was able to have the tumour removed via an endoscopic mucosal resection, in which an endoscope \u2014 a long, flexible tube \u2014 is inserted down the throat, along with a camera and tools to remove the abnormal cells.\n\nHe then had a treatment called Halo, where any remaining abnormal cells are burned away.\n\nDr Jason Dunn, a consultant gastroenterologist at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, in London, says only about a quarter of the 650,000 people in the UK estimated to have Barrett\u2019s oesophagus have the condition diagnosed. \u2018So many are missed because people dismiss their symptoms and continue taking over-the-counter remedies,\u2019 says Dr Dunn, who treated Peter.\n\n\u2018There is also lack of awareness that in some cases persistent acid reflux can lead to Barrett\u2019s, which can then lead to cancer.\n\n\u2018Although there is a low risk of developing oesophageal cancer with Barrett\u2019s, if the cells lining the oesophagus start behaving abnormally \u2014 known as dysplasia \u2014 the cancer risk rises from 0.5 per cent a year to 15 per cent.\u2019\n\nDysplasia is where the cells lining the oesophagus are replaced by the type of cell normally found in the stomach. Viewed through an endoscope camera, the oesophagus looks red and inflamed.\n\nEach year, about 9,000 people have oesophageal cancer diagnosed and it claims 8,000 lives.\n\nOne case in five is diagnosed in A&E at a late stage, when symptoms include difficulty swallowing, vomiting blood and weight loss \u2014 all signs the cancer has grown to block the oesophagus.\n\nExperts estimate that at least 950 lives a year could be saved if oesophageal cancer was diagnosed earlier.\n\nOne way to do that is by identifying people who have Barrett\u2019s oesophagus and monitoring them at a specialist centre, with regular endoscopies to check for dysplasia and early treatment to remove abnormal cells.\n\nDysplasia can be treated with endoscopic techniques in many cases, rather than open surgery.\n\nBritish research published in The Lancet last year showed taking the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole to cut stomach acid production could reduce the risk of cancer for those with Barrett\u2019s oesophagus.\n\nSometimes extensive surgery is needed: the section of the oesophagus with the abnormal cells is removed and the stomach is joined to the remaining part.\n\nConcern about the failure to spot Barrett\u2019s earlier led surgeons and cancer charities to launch a campaign group for greater awareness of the symptoms.\n\nAlan Moss, chairman of Action against Heartburn, says: \u2018We\u2019re highlighting that symptoms such as persistent hiccupping, heartburn, a bad taste in your mouth and indigestion that carry on for three weeks or more are not normal, and you need to see your GP about them.\u2019", "description": "Peter Denson, 66, a retired coach engineer from Kent, suffered 20 years of seemingly harmless hiccups, burping and heartburn.
