Barr had \u201cgone rogue,\u201d and questioned whether he could objectively make decisions about legal action in response to an explosive whistle-blower complaint accusing President Trump of misconduct, because Mr. Barr himself was mentioned in the document.\n\n\u201cI do think the attorney general has gone rogue,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said on CNN. \u201cHe has for a long time now. And since he was mentioned, in all of this, it\u2019s curious that he would be making decisions about how the complaint would be handled.\u201d\n\nEarlier Friday on MSNBC, Ms. Pelosi accused the White House trying to cover up a cover-up of the July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in which Mr. Trump pressured Mr. Zelensky to investigate a political opponent. The White House released a reconstructed transcript of the call this week, and on Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee released an unclassified version of the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint.\n\nMs. Pelosi announced the start of an impeachment inquiry before the release of the reconstructed transcript and complaint.", "description": "The House speaker says Attorney General William P.
