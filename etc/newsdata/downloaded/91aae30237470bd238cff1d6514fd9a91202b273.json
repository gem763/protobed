After visiting one of the company\u2019s more than 300 locations for a 3-D imaging session or using an at-home impression kit, each set of aligners shift a customer\u2019s teeth closer. SmileDirectClub said it takes an average of six months for teeth to reach the desired position.\n\nAlex Fenkell and Jordan Katzman founded the Nashville-based SmileDirectClub in 2014. The company had $423 million in revenue last year, compared to $145 million the year before. It took a net loss of $74 million last year, up from $32 million the year before, as its spending on marketing and other expenses rose sharply.\n\nA SmileDirectClub subscription starts at $1,895, which it said is much less costly than traditional orthodontic models. Its service also requires no in-person visits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has the endorsement of Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green, who is both a customer and a stakeholder in the business. After wearing braces for five years and breaking a retainer, he eventually ended up with SmileDirectClub to straighten his teeth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to just grab it and go and then I can change on the road,\u201d he said in a promotional video. \u201cI did photoshoots with my liners in \u2014 you can\u2019t see them.\u201d\n\nThe company said it\u2019s had more than 700,000 customers and it represents more than 95 percent of the doctor-directed al-home clear aligner industry. SmileDirectClub also said it has a lot of room to grow in the U.S. and world orthodontics markets, which it valued at $945 billion.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The online dentistry startup will begin trading on the Nasdaq Thursday.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/SDC-high-Before-and-After-3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
