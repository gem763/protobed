(Picture: Lucasfilm)\n\nFans have pointed out the battle of Rey and Kylo Ren appeared to riff on the fight between when Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi in Revenge of the Sith.\n\nWhile they\u2019re not battling among the flames, the two appeared to meet in the trailer on the wreckage of either a Star Destroyer or the Death Star.\n\nSome believe it\u2019s the former, with a Star Destroyer rising up from the sea.\n\nWho is speaking to Rey?\n\nShow yourself! (Picture: Lucasfilm)\n\nWe hear Princess Leia speaking, with Mark Hamill also weighing in on a very emotional scene, but fans are wondering who Rey is looking at as she\u2019s bathed in the blue light.\n\nSome fans have wondered whether she\u2019s looking at the force ghosts including Anakin and Obi-Wan. Others have suggested it\u2019s Yoda reflected in her eye.\n\nEmperor Palpatine makes a comeback\n\nThat you, Palpatine? (Picture: Lucasfilm)\n\n\u2018Long have I waited.\u2019 How ominous.\n\nWe hear the Emperor (Iain McDiarmid) say in the trailer: \u2018Long have I waited, and now your coming together is your undoing.\u2019\n\nWhat does it mean and more importantly, how the eff is he back?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe appears to be standing forebodingly over Rey towards the end of the trailer, seemingly propped up.\n\nIt could not be Palpatine, we still have two months till we know for sure, especially seeing as he was last seen falling into the arc reactor of the second Death Star in Return Of The Jedi.\n\nIf he was killed by Darth Vader, and that is Palpatine in the trailer, has he been cloned?\n\nWhose helmet falls in the opening sequence?\n\nWho owns this? (Picture: Lucasfilm)\n\nAs Rey quickly manouevres her way through a still-unknown planet, a helmet falls to the ground.\n\nWhether or not she was holding it or it was simply placed somewhere precariously remains to be seen, however it looks similar to those used by rebel pilots in the original trilogy.\n\nDoes this mean Rey is running through the ruins of the Battle of Yavin in 1977?\n\nSome fans have suggested this may also be Endor, the forest planet from Return Of The Jedi.\n\nIs Rose a Resistance leader?\n\nRose is bossing it (Picture: Lucasfilm)\n\nA maintenance tech who has been rising through the ranks after having her home system destroyed, Rose Tico appeared bold and brave in the trailer, as a returned Lando Calrissian rallied the troops.\n\nWhat is happening to C-P30?\n\nDon\u2019t go 3PO (Picture: Lucasfilm)\n\nIn a heartbreaking moment, the droid, with a collection of wires sticking out the back of his head, proclaimed he was \u2018taking one last look\u2026at my friends.\u2019\n\nCue all the ugly crying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJJ cannot be killing our beloved gold robot off, right?\n\nOne theory suggests he\u2019s either having his memories accessed (because he knows a thing or two about the past nine films) or having them wiped.\n\nThe scene feels like a farewell with everyone getting all emosh, but we must remind you poor C-P30 has proclaimed his ending basically any time he senses danger.\n\nHe\u2019s an anxious fella. This could just be another one of his false proclamations.\n\nDoes Reylo come true?\n\nAre they fighting on the same side? (Picture: Lucasfilm)\n\nFans have been prophesising a coming together between Rey and Kylo Ren/totally Ben Solo.\n\nBut will he jump to the side of the Resistance or will Rey go to the Dark Side?\n\nRey is heard saying: \u2018People keep telling me they know me. No one does.\u2019\n\nBut then Kylo, who emerges all wet and with lighsaber drawn before the two engage in battle says: \u2018But I do.\u2019\n\nIn another shot they destroy a figure wearing Darth Vader\u2019s helmet, seemingly sabering for the same side.\n\nThe Rise Of Skywalker is in UK cinemas 19 December.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
