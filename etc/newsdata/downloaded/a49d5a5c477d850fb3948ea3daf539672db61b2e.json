As nominal yields fall with each reduction, \u201creal rates will move and stay in negative territory, raising the appeal of holding gold,\u201d he said.\n\nGold has soared this year on increased demand for havens as the U.S.-China trade war damages global growth, prompting central banks including the Fed to adopt a more accommodative stance. In July, U.S. policy makers reduced borrowing costs for the first time in more than a decade, and they are widely expected to do so again at their Sept. 17-18 meeting. Against that backdrop, investors have boosted holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded funds.\n\n\u201cThe trade war is unlikely to be resolved quickly,\u201d Tchilinguirian said. \u201cIn this context, gold has resumed its traditional role as a safe-haven asset\u201d and holdings in ETFs are now heading toward peak levels seen in 2012, he said as BNP boosted price forecasts for this year and next.\n\nForecasts Raised\n\nGold will average $1,400 an ounce in 2019, up $60 from an earlier forecast, and $1,560 in 2020 following a rise of $130 in the outlook, BNP said in the note. The Fed\u2019s easing cycle should push average prices above $1,600 in the first quarter of 2020, it said, adding: \u201cWe expect gold to rise significantly.\u201d\n\ntraded at $1,544.32 an ounce on Wednesday, up 20% this year. Prices hit $1,555.07 on Aug. 26, the highest level since 2013.\n\nThe four cuts would reduce the upper bound on the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate to 1.25%, in line with current forward rates at 1.2%, Tchilinguirian said. The U.S. central bank \u201chas acknowledged that risk mitigation relative to foreign conditions is part and parcel of its decision-making process.\u201d\n\nInvestors will get more insight into monetary policy this week, with the New York Fed\u2019s John Williams (NYSE: ) set to speak on Wednesday followed by Chair Jerome Powell on Friday. On Tuesday, Fed Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said the U.S. economy remains \u201crelatively strong\u201d despite heightened risks.\n\n(Updates to add Fed speakers in final paragraph.)", "description": "Gold Seen Cracking $1,600 as Fed Cuts Rates Four More Times", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic86602490ede4eeb61519c78a595073d2.jpg"}
