The agency is playing its cards close to the vest. So we are suing the State and Treasury Departments for information on CFIUS\u2019 handling of investments in the U.S. by two companies tied to Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden. The companies are Ukraine\u2019s Burisma Holdings and China\u2019s Bohai Harvest RST (BHR).\n\nWe sued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after the departments failed to respond to June 24, 2019, FOIA requests for CFIUS records related to investments by the Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings LTD or any of its affiliated entities and records related to investments by the Chinese company Bohai Harvest RST or any of its affiliated entities (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:19-cv-02960)), (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of the Treasury (No. 1:19-cv-02961).\n\nHunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, is reported to be one of nine directors of BHR Partners, which was registered 12 days after the vice president\u2019s son, in December 2013, flew to Beijing aboard Air Force Two, while his father made an official visit as vice president. Hunter Biden, then-chairman of the private equity firm Rosemont Seneca, reportedly signed a deal with the Chinese government-owned Bank of China to set up the BHR $1 billion joint venture investment fund.\n\nIn 2015, BHR Partners participated in a $600 million buyout of Michigan automotive-suspension-systems maker Henniges Automotive. Henniges produces anti-vibration technologies which have important military uses, particularly in military aircraft.\n\nIn April 2014, Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings, one of the Ukraine\u2019s largest natural gas companies. Hunter was reportedly paid $50,000 a month to, in the words of a Burmisa news release, \u201cprovide support for the Company among international organizations.\u201d Biden has denied that was his role.\n\nIn 2015, Viktor Shokin, Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, launched an investigation into allegedly corrupt practices by Burisma. Shokin was ousted in 2016. And in a widely distributed 2018 video, Joe Biden confirmed that he had successfully pressured the Ukrainian government, under threat of withholding $1 billion in U.S. government aid, to fire Shokin. (In September, we sued the State Department for records about the firing of Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor after then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold aid.)\n\nThe Commerce Department recently barred over two dozen Chinese companies from doing business in the U.S., one of which is reported to be Megvii Technology, an artificial intelligence company focused on developing facial recognition technology. BHR Partners owns a stake in Megvii.\n\nHave no doubt: We will continue to press for information to get to the bottom of this influence-peddling scandal involving Joe Biden and his son. As Congress is obsessed with attacking President Trump, it is again up to us to do the basic investigative work on this growing scandal.", "description": "We are suing for information on CFIUS\u2019 handling of investments in the U.S. by two companies tied to Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden.", "authors": ["Tom Fitton"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Biden-Family-2009-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
