We have to consider that. You can\u2019t have everything every time,\" said Mboweni.\n\nMboweni said with various problems dogging Eskom - financial and otherwise - the executive and legislature would need to insist on accountability and competence.\n\n\"One of the key issues we need to solve is appointing the correct people to run Eskom.\n\n\"We must appoint the correct board of directors, a competent management team, and we must be able to hold them accountable for Eskom,\" Mboweni said.\n\nNo more blank cheques\n\nAfrican National Congress MP and former deputy minister of finance Sfiso Buthelezi told the National Assembly that Eskom must not be allowed to default on its debt, as this would lead to cross defaults.\n\nDemocratic Alliance MP Ashor Sarupen said the bill, in its present form, was a blank cheque for more of the same at Eskom and would diminish of oversight and accountability for public money. \"It allows Eskom to continue to hold a gun to the heads of our citizens, our businesses and our government,\" Sarupen said.\n\nEconomic Freedom Fighters MP Floyd Shivambu said problems at Eskom ranged from financial constraints all the way to leadership and a restricted capacity to negotiate with suppliers and other businesses in the energy sector, particularly renewables. He was particularly critical of the appointment of board chair Jabu Mabuza as acting CEO, adding: \"The bigger crisis Eskom is facing is the stabilisation of coal prices. Established coal suppliers are supplying to Eskom at a higher than market relevant price per ton.\"\n\nDoomed if you do, doomed if you don't\n\nInkatha Freedom Party MP Mfakazeleni Buthelezi told the National Assembly that the party opted to support the special appropriation bill as the country would be \"doomed if it did and doomed if it didn't.\"\n\nFreedom Front Plus MP Wouter Wessels blamed the ruling party and said cadre deployment was behind looting and neglect at Eskom.\n\nACDP MP Steve Swart said: \"A special ad hoc committee must be established to oversee Eskom to ensure that the conditions of this bailout are complied with.\"\n\nUDM MP Nqabayomzi Kwankwa said governance weaknesses at Eskom had not been addressed and that there was no clear turnaround strategy for Eskom. He called for a concept document to define unbundling and allay fears of privatisation.", "description": "While the DA, the EFF, and other, smaller parties objected to its passing, 200 votes in favour were enough to get the controversial bill through - bringing the power utility one step closer to a R59bn bailout.", "authors": ["Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7930/101bef2021a343cfbcaca0f19e50c243.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
