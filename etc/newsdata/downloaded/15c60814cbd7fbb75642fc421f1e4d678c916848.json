It gave no financial details, but two sources familiar with the situation said the transaction was worth about 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion).\n\nOne of the sources said the new firm may launch an IPO from 2023 in order to benefit from the growing global appetite for content from platforms such as Netflix (NFLX.O).\n\nBanijay said total pro-forma 2019 revenue of the combined group will be about 3 billion euros and that upon completion of the acquisition, Banijay will own almost 200 production companies in 23 countries and territories.\n\nIts combined catalog will include game shows and reality TV formats such as \u201cBig Brother\u201d, \u201cMasterChef\u201d, \u201cSurvivor\u201d and \u201cWife Swap\u201d as well as singing contest \u201cThe Voice\u201d, and critically acclaimed series such as technology dystopia \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d and post-World War One gangster drama \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d.\n\nIn France, Banijay produces adventure game shows \u201cFort Boyard\u201d and \u201cKoh Lanta\u201d as well as talk shows presented by Nagui and Cyril Hanouna.\n\nThe deal ends a bumpy, months-long race to find a buyer for the Netherlands-based Endemol Shine Group, which is co-owned by The Walt Disney Company (DIS.N) and private equity group Apollo Global Management, Inc. (APO.N).\n\nEndemol Shine was put up for sale in July 2018 with a price tag of 2.5-3 billion euros ($2.8-$3.3 billion). It drew interest from several bidders at the time though the pool of suitors eventually shrank, with European broadcaster RTL Group (RRTL.DE) walking away in August 2018.\n\nThe acquisition will be financed through a Banijay capital increase and the refinancing of Banijay and Endemol\u2019s existing debt, supported by Deutsche Bank, Natixis and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. One source said Banijay could issue 300-400 million euros of new equity.\n\nPost-closing, the combined group will be held by LDH (67.1%) and French media conglomerate Vivendi (VIV.PA) (32.9%).\n\nLDH is a holding company controlled by Financi\u00e8re LOV (52%), the investment arm of Banijay founder Stephane Courbit, who headed Endemol France from 2001 to 2007 before launching his own firm. Current Banijay CEO formerly ran Endemol\u2019s Italian unit.\n\nOther LDH shareholders are Italian group De Agostini with 36% of the capital, and Fimalac, the investment company of French investor Marc Ladreit de Lacharri\u00e8re, which will own 12% of the capital.\n\nThe deal is conditional on approval by antitrust authorities.\n\n($1 = 0.9027 euros)", "description": "French media firm Banijay will pay about 2 billion euros for Endemol Shine, the production house behind global television hits such as \"The Voice\" and \"Black Mirror\", creating a new leader in reality TV, game shows and TV series, sources said.", "authors": ["Gw\u00e9na\u00eblle Barzic", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
