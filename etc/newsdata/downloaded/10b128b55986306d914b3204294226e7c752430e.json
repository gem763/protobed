According to the latest rumours, this could see the first iPhone 11 Pro (or XI Pro), a larger Max model and a cheaper model, which could simply be called the iPhone 11 or the iPhone 11 R.\n\nWhile there is plenty of speculation about naming, we do know the new iPhone will come with a triple lens camera, a \u201chaptic touch\u201d feature and several new colours.\n\nThe launch comes one year after Apple launched the iPhone XS, and two years since its last radical redesign with the iPhone X model.\n\nHowever, fans waiting for a 5G iPhone are likely to be disappointed. According to the latest reports, Apple is holding off until it launches three 5G phones in 2020.\n\nApple will be hoping its new models win over fans as smartphone sales have stalled amid a global slowdown. At its event in Cupertino, California, the company could also show off new software from iOS 13 and its planned paid-for TV streaming app.\n\nThere are also reports that over the next few months other products including a refreshed iPad Pro, an iPad with a larger screen, new Apple Watch models and a new MacBook Pro could all be unveiled.\n\nHere is what we know so far about Apple's upcoming smartphone.\n\nWhen will the iPhone 11 be released?\n\nApple has invited media to an event on Tuesday, September 10 at 10am Pacific Time (6pm BST) at the Steve Jobs Theatre, a dedicated venue at its Silicon Valley headquarters, where it has held the last two iPhone launches.\n\nThe invitation is titled \"By innovation only\" with an accompanying Apple logo that harks back to the company's old multicoloured logo.\n\nApple's graphic for its September 10 event Credit: Apple More\n\niPhone invitations have often held a cryptic message. In this case, the colours are most likely to be the style options for the new line-up.\n\nAs for its release, iPhones typically go on sale the Friday after the launch event, which would suggest they will be available on Friday September 20.\n\nThe event will be shown on Apple's events page, Apple TV and can be streamed for the first time on YouTube. Here is how to watch it.\n\nWhat will the iPhone 11 look like?\n\nThe new iPhone is predicted to have a 5.8-inch display, like the iPhone XS but with smaller sides, meaning the screen should fill even more of the front of the phone.\n\nThe phone will have an OLED screen that can offer deeper blacks in the premium iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Max models. A cheaper model is still expected to use an LCD screen design.\n\nIt is possible that the new models will also be thinner and lighter.\n\nA render of how the triple camera iPhone 11 will look Credit: Olixar More\n\nStory continues", "description": "Apple is preparing to reveal its new iPhone at an event tomorrow which could see a triple phone launch\u00a0and a slew of upgrades.", "authors": ["Natasha Dangoor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1smyc.fdy_ZqqFMTfLGaUg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/59cfd42fa07eb8c8c4e310332c46ab76", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
