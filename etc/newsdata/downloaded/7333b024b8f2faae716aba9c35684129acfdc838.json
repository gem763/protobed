According to the president, the unidentified \"number one replacement has been terminated by American troops.\"\n\n\"Just confirmed that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's number one replacement has been terminated by American troops. Most likely would have taken the top spot - Now he is also Dead!\" the president tweeted.\n\nThe White House did not immediately clarify which ISIS leader the president was referencing. But a State Department official confirmed Monday that a strike did kill ISIS spokesman Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir in a strike on Sunday, CBS News Pentagon correspondent David Martin reports.\n\nMr. Trump has taken pride in the death of al-Baghdadi, which he alluded to in a cryptic tweet Saturday night before making a formal announcement from the White House's Diplomatic Room Sunday morning. On Monday, the president continued to highlight al-Baghdadi's death as a mark of the United States' success against ISIS.\n\n\"He was a sick and depraved man and now he's dead,\" Mr. Trump told police chiefs during a speech in Chicago. \"He's dead, he's dead as a door nail. And he didn't die bravely either, I will tell you that. He should have been killed years ago. Another president should have gotten him.\n\n\"But to me it was a very important, I would say all the time, they would walk into my office, 'sir we killed this leader at a level, this leader at-' I said I never heard of him, I want al-Baghdadi, that's the only one I know now, I want al-Baghdadi, get him, and they got him.\"\n\nThe Pentagon is expected to release video of the raid that killed al-Baghdadi.", "description": "The president tweeted \"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's number one replacement has been terminated by American troops\"", "authors": ["Kathryn Watson", "Kathryn Watson Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/27/ba31f38f-3486-4a68-a67e-d3b7497774be/thumbnail/1200x630/14e7a9e19f360fd90f39c6a8fcb8ed56/gettyimages-1183767850.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
