Kelly\u201d and his continued support for victims of sexual abuse and harassment.\n\n\u201cHe was already canceled in my mind,\u201d Legend told the outlet about his criticism of the singer. \u201cA few years ago, we had a party at the house and we had a DJ playing music. R. Kelly came on and I walked up to the DJ and said, \u2019We don\u2019t play him in this house.\u2019\u201d", "description": "The singer is working on a retooled version of the Christmas standard featuring Kelly Clarkson.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db70e4f2100000135ad41fb.jpeg?cache=rkejkvqehu&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
