With so many courses, there are inevitably hurdles to overcome. So here are a few troubleshooting and time-saving tips that will help you get the meal on the table while reducing food waste.\n\nRoasting-Rack Hack\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a roasting rack, roll up some tin foil and coil it to nestle under your bird, or set it on a layer of roughly chopped onions, carrots and celery, which will add flavour to the drippings for your gravy.\n\nSlow-Cooked Turkey Wins The Race\n\nCook smaller turkeys in a 6-quart oval slow cooker \u2014 it won\u2019t have the deep golden skin you might associate with roasted turkey, but will be incredibly moist and juicy, and there is no stressing over the timing! Tuck herbs and a halved lemon into the cavity, season with salt and pepper, cover (no need to add liquid), seal with foil if there are any gaps in the lid, and cook on low for 6-8 hours.\n\nPrevent Boil-Over Mayhem\n\nA wooden spoon set over your pot will keep it from boiling over.\n\nLumps Be Gone\n\nFix lumpy gravy by pouring it through a sieve.\n\nGet Saucy\n\nAdd a small amount of soy sauce to your gravy (instead of salt) to season it while adding colour.\n\nDried, Tested, and True\n\nToo many fresh herbs? Lay them out on a baking sheet and bake for a few hours at your oven\u2019s lowest setting. Once completely dry, crumble into airtight containers or ziplock baggies for storage.\n\nGrate Your Butter\n\nGrate cold butter into your pastry or biscuits. Mark the measurement off on the side with a knife\u2013it\u2019s faster and easier than cutting it into bits and blending it in. This is also a great way to soften butter quickly and easily for baking.\n\nPeeling is so Pass\u00e9\n\nUse thin-skinned potatoes and don\u2019t bother peeling them; quarter and roughly mash with butter, cream, salt and pepper. It\u2019s less work, you\u2019ll get more nutrients from the potato skins, and no pressure to make them lump-free and smooth.\n\nGet Thrifty\n\nIf you don\u2019t have enough dishes to serve a crowd, visit the thrift store \u2014 mismatched plates are in.\n\nMuffin Tin For The Win\n\nBake extra stuffing in muffin tins \u2014 it cooks through more quickly and is easy to serve, especially to kids.\n\nWhip Up a New Flavour\n\nFlavour your whipped cream by sweetening it with maple syrup \u2014 or infuse the cream with fresh herbs, ginger, vanilla, tea leaves or lavender, then strain before you whip it.\n\nPack Some Pumpkin Punch\n\nIf your recipe doesn\u2019t call for a whole can of pumpkin, freeze leftovers in large spoonfuls to add a boost of beta-carotene to muffins, waffles, pancakes, soup, stew, smoothies or chili.\n\nCreative With Crans\n\nGet creative with your cranberries. Add frozen chopped rhubarb or raspberries for a new dimension, and simmer with OJ instead of water.\n\nBottoms Up\n\nPour ends of the red wine bottles into a pitcher and add apple and orange slices, a couple of cinnamon sticks and a spoonful of brown sugar, and voila: sangria!\n\nSharing is Caring\n\nPick up inexpensive plastic take-out containers at a restaurant supply store to send home leftovers in.\n\nDIY Ganache: It's In The Bag\n\nMelt chocolate chips in a ziplock baggie in a bowl of warm water or make a quick ganache: Warm cream on the stovetop or in the microwave, remove from the heat and add the same quantity of chocolate chips. Let sit for a minute or two, then whisk until smooth. Spoon into a ziplock baggie, snip off a corner and drizzle over cake, ice cream, pie and whipped cream, or anything you want to fancy up a bit.\n\nFake It 'Til You Make It\n\nSkipping a step with a frozen pie shell? Press down around the edges with the tines of a fork to make it look more homemade.\n\nHopefully these hacks help you enjoy your Thanksgiving with a little less stress!", "description": "Save time and reduce food waste with these ingenious Thanksgiving dinner tricks and tips.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/parents/content/imgs/_8col/THANKSGIVINGDINNERHACKS_LEAD_JULIE_VAN_ROSENDAAL.jpg", "published_at": "2016-10-04"}
