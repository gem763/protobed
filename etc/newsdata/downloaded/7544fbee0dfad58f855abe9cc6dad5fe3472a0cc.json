The Montreal artist's sophomore album is steeped in jazz and R&B and is part of a trilogy in which she explores the roots of African-American musical culture.\n\nThe winner will be announced on Sept. 16, 2019. The $50,000 award is annually given to the best full-length Canadian album.\n\nCBC Books asked Dominique Fils-Aim\u00e9 to recommend a book that is meaningful to her. She chose L'art du bouddhisme by Dalai-Lama.\n\n\"This book, as an early adult, provided me with many lessons and messages of love that stayed with me until this day. Not for any religious aspect, but for the way of life that is suggested, one that works for the advancement of all. The kindness, empathy and wisdom resonated with my wish to find purpose and the gut feeling we all have \u2014 that feeling that we are actually connected to one another.\n\n\"It reminded me we are one. It reminded me we are capable of generating endless amounts of love, love for everyone including ourselves, love that should be the starting point of all intention and action.\"\n\nDominique Fils-Aim\u00e9's comments have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWatch this video profile of Dominique Fils-Aim\u00e9", "description": "Dominique Fils-Aim\u00e9, whose album Stay Tuned! is up for the 2019 Polaris Prize, says this book \"reminded me we are one.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5285255.1568649754!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/dominique-fils-aime-recommends-reading-l-art-du-bouddhisme.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
