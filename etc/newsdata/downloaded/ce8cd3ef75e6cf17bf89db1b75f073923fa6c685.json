I\u2019ve covered a couple of them myself. But I didn\u2019t really step back and think about how spectacularly awful major media has been this week until I read Mark Hemingway\u2019s piece titled \u201c24 hours of Media Malpractice.\u201d This really was a banner week for the media and I think I know why. What\u2019s more, I think I know what\u2019s coming next.\n\nSunday: The media\u2019s no good, very bad week actually started Sunday when the NY Times published a story bemoaning the fact that conservative operatives had threatened to systematically embarrass professional journalists by\u2014wait for it\u2014digging up their public statements on social media. Allahpundit wrote about the absurdity of the Times or anyone else in the media complaining about behavior that has been standard operating procedure at Media Matters and elsewhere for years.\n\nMonday: In fact, the NY Times panic was so absurd that writers for the Post and Politico wrote pieces saying so. Here\u2019s Politico\u2019s Jack Shafer:\n\nJournalists don\u2019t deserve a get-out-of-bigotry-jail free card just because they\u2019re journalists. If their past tweets, however ancient, undercut their current journalistic work or make them sound hypocritical, they can\u2019t blame their diminished prestige on Trump\u2019s allies. It\u2019s like blaming a cop for writing you a ticket for speeding in a school zone.\n\nTuesday: But the media was just getting started. Here\u2019s Mark Hemingway:\n\nJust before 10 a.m., someone else at the Washington Post made another outrageous and unsupported accusation of racism. The New York Times\u2019 Jeremy Peters had written an article assessing the impact of the Tea Party protests 10 years later. Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery, who is the paper\u2019s \u201cnational correspondent covering law enforcement, justice and their intersection with politics and policy\u201d \u2014 and ostensibly not an opinion journalist \u2014 took to Twitter to express his disapproval of the story. \u201cHow do you write a 10 years later piece on the Tea Party and not mention \u2013 not once, not even in passing \u2013 the fact that it was essentially a hysterical grassroots tantrum about the fact that a black guy was president? Journalistic malpractice,\u201d he tweeted out to his 600,000 followers. It\u2019s true that there were a few racially charged signs that popped up at Tea Party rallies, but there are always fringe characters in every large crowd, especially at political protests. I covered multiple Tea Party rallies at the time \u2013 Lowery was still a teenager in 2009, so I presume he doesn\u2019t have a lot of first-hand experience talking to Tea Party protesters \u2013 and I saw and heard nothing to indicate widespread racial animus. If the media covered the nearly concurrent Occupy Wall Street protests by highlighting the same fringe extremism, we\u2019d unfairly dismiss the left\u2019s sincerity out of hand and conclude that they were engaged in a hysterical tantrum in support of rape and defecating on cop cars\u2026 Still, Lowery\u2019s objections \u2013 and those of lots of other journalists and angry social media activists \u2013 to the Times piece won the day. Tuesday afternoon, just after 2 p.m., the Times\u2019 official Twitter account made it, well, official: \u201cWe have updated this story assessing the policy failures of the Tea Party movement 10 years after its rise to include context about attacks on President Barack Obama and racist displays at some Tea Party rallies.\u201d\n\nAlso Tuesday, the Washington Post published a piece in its Post Everything section which strongly suggested author JD Vance was promoting white supremacy in a public speech. That was clearly false as even a cursory reading of the speech demonstrated. After getting pushback the Post removed the accusation and added a correction which clarified that Vance was not channeling white supremacy. However, the author of the piece refused to apologize and claimed on Twitter that the idea to target Vance came from her editor at the Post.\n\nTuesday night MSNBC\u2019s Lawrence O\u2019Donnell looked at the media landscape and cried out hold my beer. O\u2019Donnell went on his nightly MSNBC show and claimed that President Trump\u2019s Deutsche Bank loan documents had been co-signed by Russian oligarchs. Throughout, his show, O\u2019Donnell kept repeating that \u201cif true\u201d this was a devastating story but admitted he hadn\u2019t seen the documents.\n\nWednesday: In the early afternoon, O\u2019Donnell announced on Twitter that he\u2019d made a mistake.\n\nLast night I made an error in judgment by reporting an item about the president\u2019s finances that didn\u2019t go through our rigorous verification and standards process. I shouldn\u2019t have reported it and I was wrong to discuss it on the air. I will address the issue on my show tonight. \u2014 Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) August 28, 2019\n\nWednesday night, O\u2019Donnell admitted \u201cI did not go through the rigorous verification and standards process here at MSNBC before repeating what I heard from my source. (This was such a blatant failure that Erik Wemple at the Post is wondering aloud today whether O\u2019Donnell should even have a show.)\n\nThere was also a social media freakout Wednesday suggesting that a policy change meant the children of US servicepeople who were born abroad would no longer be citizens. That was false.\n\nThursday: The Washington Post has more conservatives to smear. In another piece for the Post Everything section, the Post allows a writer to claim that \u201creasonable conservatives\u201d sound suspiciously like antebellum racists. Her entire argument boils down to cherry-picking a few lines from various authors and claiming the tone is the same. The author compares the ideas of \u201creasonable conservatives\u201d to a virus being spread through\u2014get this\u2014free speech.\n\nToday is Friday and it\u2019s still early so I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019ll be adding more items to this list today. But to sum up: Monday it was dastardly conservatives threatening journalists (with public accountability for public comments). Tuesday it was the Tea Party, plus conservative-friendly author JD Vance as a white supremacist, plus President Trump as a Russian stooge. Wednesday it was another immigration freakout with people claiming the Trump administration was up to no good. Thursday it was \u201creasonable conservatives\u201d sounding like racists.\n\nSome of the stories (O\u2019Donnell, the Post\u2019s JD Vance claim) got corrected internally and some got corrected externally (the NY Times whinging about accountability, the immigration freakout). But all of the errors involve conservatives as villains (though I guess the \u201cerror\u201d in the Tea Party piece was that it didn\u2019t call the Tea Party racist, the correction did that).\n\nI think this week is a harbinger of things to come. Why? Because the Mueller report didn\u2019t work out as Democrats and the media hoped. There\u2019s no public appetite for impeachment. Progressives are getting nervous and the NY Times has signaled privately and publicly, through its 1619 Project, that the 2020 election will be all about racism because that\u2019s the best chance Democrats have to activate their base.\n\nSo what\u2019s coming next? A lot more careless mistakes by the usual suspects looking to drag Trump and the GOP down. What this week demonstrates is that many of them care less about their credibility than ensuring the desired outcome. This isn\u2019t really new of course. In fact, some version of this happens every four years.
