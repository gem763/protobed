(Photo: VALERIE MACON/ AFP/GETTY IMAGES)\n\nBritney Spears is back to her signature blonde hair color shortly after coloring it brown.\n\nThe pop star shared a short video to Instagram showing off her golden locks which were piled on top of her head.\n\n\"So maybe blondes do have more fun,\" Spears captioned the post. \"It\u2019s not professional Hollywood hair and makeup .... but hey it\u2019s real and I\u2019m watching Vacation!\"\n\nShe added that she had just gone for a swim in the pool, hence her wet hair. The first time Spears appeared as a brunette was in early September on her Instagram page.\n\nA day earlier, the 37-year-old artist shared a photo sitting in a tree in Maui, raising her hands up. She wrote she always feels alive when she sees the ocean.\n\n\"Nothing heals more than the ocean,\" she wrote. \"This pic does not do justice at all for I saw there. In a world where we are all subjected to cell phones and devices .... we get hung up on screens instead of Mother Nature and listening to her.\"\n\nIn May, Spears appeared in court alongside her parents over her conservatorship, where a judge ordered an expert evaluation of the singer's situation.\n\nFor years, Spears has been publicly silent about the severe restrictions on her decisions put in place in 2008, which placed control of nearly all of her affairs in the hands of her father, Jamie.\n\nIn September, a judge approved a request to name the singer's current care manager, Jodi Montgomery, as her new temporary conservator, according to court documents obtained by Entertainment Tonight and Us Weekly.\n\nMontgomery will take over the role from Spears' father, Jamie, who had served as the pop star's conservator since 2008, following her public meltdown and hospitalization.\n\nAs her conservator, Montgomery will have the power to limit or restrict Spears' visitors, the power to access the Grammy winner's medical records and the ability to retain caretakers and security guards for Spears around the clock, according to documents.\n\nContributing Associated Press and Cydney Henderson\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/16/britney-spears-instagram-shows-off-new-blonde-look-says-ocean-heals/3995627002/", "description": "After being a brunette for about a month, Britney Spears shared that she dyed her hair back to blonde.", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Published A.M.
