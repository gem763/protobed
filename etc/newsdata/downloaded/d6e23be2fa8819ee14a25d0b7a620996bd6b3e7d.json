Federal investigators have questioned at least one former Boeing employee about the allegations, said another person with knowledge of the discussions who similarly requested anonymity.\n\nIt is unclear what, if any, assessment investigators have made of the complaint.\n\nThe complaint, filed after the two crashes, builds on concerns about Boeing\u2019s corporate culture, as the company tries to repair its reputation and get the planes flying again.\n\nMany current and former Boeing employees have privately discussed problems with the design and decision-making process on the 737 Max, outlining episodes when managers dismissed engineers\u2019 recommendations or prioritized profits. The engineer who filed the ethics concerns this year, Curtis Ewbank, went a step further, lodging a formal complaint and calling out the chief executive for publicly misrepresenting the safety of the plane.", "description": "The company passed on the concerns to the Department of Justice as part of a criminal investigation into the engineering of the plane after two fatal crashes.", "authors": ["Natalie Kitroeff", "David Gelles", "Jack Nicas"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/business/02boeing/02boeing-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg"}
