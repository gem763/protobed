Bring back ex-QB Ricky Stanzi", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE USA TODAY Sports' Paul Myerberg breaks down the latest Amway Coaches Poll. USA TODAY\n\nThe University of Iowa needs to break a miniature curse that Penn State University has on its football program.\n\nSo who better to help than coach Kirk Ferentz's most reliable Nittany Lions tamer?\n\nFormer Hawkeyes quarterback Ricky Stanzi will serve as honorary captain when No. 18 Iowa hosts ninth-ranked Penn State (5-0, 2-0 Big Ten Conference) on Saturday night at Kinnick Stadium. Stanzi will accompany the Iowa captains to midfield for the pregame coin toss and also be with the Hawkeyes in the locker room before and after the game.\n\nThe Hawkeyes (4-1, 1-1) could use the pick-me-up. Not only is Iowa licking its wounds after last Saturday's 10-3 loss at Michigan, it has lost five consecutive games to the Nittany Lions. The past two have come in particularly painful fashion, losing in 2017 at Kinnick at night on the game's final play, and in a rain-soaked, one-score setback last season.\n\nIowa's last victory against Penn State was a 24-3 triumph in October 2010, and yep, you guessed it -- Stanzi was under center.\n\nStanzi was a three-year letterman for Iowa from 2008-10, and he went 3-0 against Penn State over the course of his 35 starts. He famously led the Hawkeyes to a 24-23 upset over the then-No. 3 Nittany Lions on Nov. 8, 2008, when Daniel Murray kicked a 31-yard field goal in the final seconds.\n\nFormer Iowa QB Ricky Stanzi will be back in Iowa City on Saturday for the Penn State game.

Stanzi was injured in the first half of a loss to Northwestern and missed the final two games of the regular season before returning to guide the Hawkeyes' 2010 Orange Bowl win over Georgia Tech.\n\nStanzi is the only Iowa quarterback (and just third Big Ten quarterback) to lead his team to three bowl wins, a feat current quarterback Nate Stanley will likely have a chance to match this season. He ranks third in program history in career passing yards (7,377) and total offense (7,373) and is fourth in touchdown passes (56), having recently been passed by Stanley.\n\nStanzi was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fifth round of the 2011 NFL draft and was in the NFL for five seasons.", "description": "Iowa\u00a0wants to break a miniature curse against Penn State.
