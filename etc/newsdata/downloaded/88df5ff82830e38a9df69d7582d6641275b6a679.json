Why are they shaming women?", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-08-27", "text": "It\u2019s been nearly two years since the current, most public phase of the #MeToo movement began.\n\nThe months of near-daily allegations against high-profile men are over, and in their place are bigger questions about how, as a society, we can reckon with those allegations.\n\nThose questions have no easy answers. So perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that one response at this particular point in #MeToo has been to argue that while the movement is valid, it has gone too far.\n\nThis was the subtext of Jane Mayer\u2019s recent New Yorker investigation into the allegations against former Sen. Al Franken. And in a recent story in the libertarian magazine Reason, Emily Yoffe makes the critique more explicitly, arguing that allegations against former Los Angeles Times reporter Jonathan Kaiman reveal deep flaws in the movement.\n\nKaiman was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women, including reporter Felicia Sonmez, who says that he digitally penetrated her without her consent. The allegations, which Kaiman disputes, led to an investigation by the Times and Kaiman\u2019s eventual resignation.\n\nYoffe casts Kaiman as a victim of \u201cmob justice,\u201d and blames Sonmez and another woman, Laura Tucker, for ruining his promising career by speaking out. \u201cWe are now in a time when the uncertain circumstances surrounding one regretted sexual encounter and another hazily remembered (and fiercely disputed) intimate encounter are sufficient to destroy the accused\u2019s life,\u201d she writes.\n\nMeanwhile, Sonmez says that Yoffe misrepresented many aspects of her account \u2014 and that what happened to Kaiman resulted from his actions, not her decision to talk about them.\n\nThe #MeToo movement has raised real questions about how to adjudicate allegations of sexual misconduct in a way that\u2019s fair to all parties, when the legal system and many company human resources departments are so demonstrably unequal to the task. #MeToo\u2019s critics have brought up some of these questions. But in the process, they often shame the women who have spoken out, casting them as part of a vindictive mob out to ruin men\u2019s lives.\n\nTwo years into the current phase of #MeToo, the time is ripe for a conversation about what justice in sexual misconduct cases should look like. But that conversation can only be productive if it includes the voices of the people who have risked their careers, their mental health, and sometimes their safety by coming forward. We all lose if those voices are shamed back into silence.\n\nRecent critics of #MeToo say the movement is valid \u2014 but goes too far\n\nCritiques of the #MeToo movement began popping up soon after it gained steam. In January 2018, for example, Daphne Merkin argued in the New York Times that women, including some feminists, were criticizing #MeToo privately even as they praised it publicly \u2014 \u201csome women, including random people I talk to in supermarket lines, have gone so far as to call it an outright witch hunt,\u201d she wrote. The same month, the sexual misconduct allegations against Aziz Ansari led to a round of backlash: At the Atlantic, Caitlin Flanagan wrote that young women were \u201cangry and temporarily powerful, and last night they destroyed a man who didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\n\n#MeToo backlash has continued in tandem with the movement, with some accused men joining in \u2014 John Hockenberry, for example, a former WNYC radio host who was accused of sexual harassment or unwanted messages by multiple women, wrote at Harper\u2019s last October about the injustices he saw in his situation and the need for \u201ca return to romance\u201d in American life.\n\nSome more recent critiques, however, have taken a different tone. In her New Yorker story, Mayer does not take the entire #MeToo movement to task. Rather, she casts the handling of the allegations against Franken as a threat to the movement. Mayer quotes Debra Katz, a lawyer who represented Christine Blasey Ford: \u201cThe allegations levelled against Senator Franken did not warrant his forced expulsion from the Senate, particularly given the context in which most of the behavior occurred, which was in his capacity as a comedian.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo treat all allegations the same is not only inappropriate,\u201d Katz tells Mayer. \u201cIt feeds into a backlash narrative that men are vulnerable to even frivolous allegations by women.\u201d\n\nYoffe is similarly concerned with threats to the movement. \u201c#MeToo is a necessary and important corrective to some horrifying, copiously documented, and criminal-level behavior, and also to the kind of persistent harassment that still characterizes too many workplaces,\u201d she writes.\n\nBut some allegations do not merit bringing up in the context of #MeToo, she argues: \u201cWe are now in a time when a sexual encounter can be recast in a malevolent light, no matter whether the participants all appeared to consider it consensual at the time.\u201d\n\nAnd for Yoffe, bringing up such encounters now can tarnish the movement: \u201ccreating injustice today does not undo the harms of the past; instead it undermines the integrity of the necessary effort to address sexual misconduct.\u201d\n\nYoffe hangs her argument primarily on the case of Kaiman, at one time the Beijing bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn a January 2018 Medium post, Tucker wrote that Kaiman had pressured her into sex, refusing to leave her apartment and coercing her to continue after she told him clearly that she wanted to stop. According to Yoffe, Kaiman remembers the night differently and believes no coercion occurred.\n\nSonmez, meanwhile, says that Kaiman digitally penetrated her without her consent after a night of drinking, refusing to stop until she pushed him away, and that he later had unprotected sex with her when she was very drunk.\n\n\u201cI am devastated by the fact that I was not more sober, so that I could say with absolute certainty whether what happened that night was rape,\u201d Sonmez wrote in a letter to the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of China, a professional association of which Kaiman was a part.\n\nAccording to Yoffe, Kaiman says the sex was protected and Sonmez only objected to being digitally penetrated because they were in public at the time. \u201cKaiman says he has never forced himself on anyone and is sickened at the idea of it,\u201d Yoffe writes.\n\nBut after an investigation by the Los Angeles Times, Yoffe reports, Kaiman was told in August 2018 to resign or be fired; he resigned.\n\nNow, Yoffe writes, Kaiman is \u201cjobless and homeless\u201d and has considered suicide. \u201cOn the basis of equivocal and heavily disputed accusations,\u201d she writes, \u201cKaiman\u2019s life is in tatters.\u201d\n\nCriticisms of #MeToo often include criticism of women for \u201cgoing public\u201d\n\nIn her investigation of the allegations against Franken, Mayer devotes a great deal of space to the question of whether actress Leeann Tweeden was right to be upset that Franken had mimed grabbing her breasts for a photo. She includes a detailed description of Tweeden\u2019s previous performances with Franken, which included a kiss with an audience member: \u201cIn video footage, she seems to be gamely playing the part, setting off hoots and hollers from the crowd,\u201d Mayer writes.\n\nNo one disputes that the photo is genuine, and Franken has apologized for it. But Mayer strongly implies that Tweeden was wrong to complain about it, at least in the way she did.\n\nYoffe has a similar criticism for the women who reported misconduct by Kaiman.\n\nOf Tucker, Yoffe asks, \u201cWhy would she go public \u2014 giving Kaiman no warning \u2014 with this story of a long-ago, private event that, while regretted, did not involve a sexual assault? Especially since in telling it she was sure to damage someone who had been a friend and who held no power over her?\u201d\n\nYoffe also writes that while Tucker\u2019s testimony might not have been enough to harm Kaiman, \u201cthe Sonmez accusation changed everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though it is disputed by Kaiman, that charge established in the minds of many that what happened between Kaiman and Tucker was not just a single regretted event but part of a pattern,\u201d Yoffe writes. \u201cAnd pattern is an explosive concept in the world of #MeToo.\u201d\n\nSonmez has responded to Yoffe\u2019s story with a detailed thread of corrections that casts much of Yoffe\u2019s story into doubt. For instance, Sonmez writes that another allegation against Kaiman had been shared privately before Tucker went public with hers. She also writes that Kaiman has acknowledged digitally penetrating her without her consent.\n\nAnd she takes issue with the idea that her allegation established a \u201cpattern\u201d in the minds of investigators. \u201cMy accusation and Ms. Tucker\u2019s are not what established that Mr. Kaiman has a pattern of misconduct,\u201d she writes. \u201cMr. Kaiman\u2019s own alleged actions are what established that.\u201d\n\nShaming women does nothing to help the movement\n\nIf Yoffe\u2019s intent was to draw attention to the imperfections in the way American society handles allegations of sexual misconduct, she chose a worthy cause. The legal system is notoriously ill-equipped to handle such allegations. The legal definition of sexual harassment is so restrictive that it does not capture much behavior that can damage people\u2019s lives and careers. Meanwhile, allegations of sexual assault rarely lead to convictions, and people who come forward can be retraumatized by authorities who shame or blame them for their own violation.\n\nIt\u2019s telling that Yoffe mentions the convictions of Bill Cosby and Larry Nassar \u2014 it often takes the allegations of dozens of women to make a criminal conviction stick (Cosby, notably, had to be tried twice).\n\nInternal investigations by companies are little better. For every story like Kaiman\u2019s, there are several like that of astrophysicist and TV host Neil deGrasse Tyson, who was investigated by his employers at Fox, the National Geographic Channel, and the American Museum of Natural History after several women accused him of sexual misconduct. In the end, he kept all of his jobs after a process that, according to the women, lacked transparency.\n\n#MeToo has raised real questions about how, given the failings of both the legal system and company human resources departments, we should actually adjudicate claims of sexual misconduct. Yoffe\u2019s story points to some of these questions. For example, she writes that Kaiman is \u201cone of the least famous, least powerful men on the lists published by The New York Times and Bloomberg of those who have lost their jobs in the wake of #MeToo.\u201d\n\nMany of the most high-profile men accused of sexual misconduct as part of #MeToo are planning or have already executed their comebacks. Louis C.K. is performing again; Mark Halperin has a book deal. Others don\u2019t need to make a comeback because they never faced consequences \u2014 President Trump, for example, has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women, and remains in charge of the country.\n\nYoffe also notes that the loss of a job and public opprobrium can lead to real psychological pain for the accused party. This is not a reason to keep someone in a job when that person might be a threat to others, but it is a reason to consider what kinds of mental health support people who lose their jobs as a result of #MeToo (or, for that matter, for any other reason) might need, and how to ensure that they get it. Suicidal depression is in no way an appropriate punishment for sexual misconduct.\n\nThe framework of restorative justice has been used on college campuses in sexual misconduct cases, and holds some promise in thinking about #MeToo on a larger scale as well. In restorative justice, the focus is on repairing the harm done, not necessarily on meting out punishment. The alleged perpetrator is often part of the process, and can receive the support necessary to address the root causes of the harm as well as to prevent reoffending.\n\nBut too often, those who say that #MeToo goes too far have called not for such holistic approaches, but for women to stay silent. Yoffe criticizes the investigative process at the Los Angeles Times, but her main thesis seems to be that if only Tucker and Sonmez had thought more before they talked about what happened to them, Kaiman would still have his job and his happiness.\n\nPeople who speak up about sexual misconduct \u2014 especially if they\u2019re women \u2014 have long been blamed, shamed, and disbelieved. They\u2019ve long been told that their words are unseemly and that they should be quiet before they ruin men\u2019s lives. #MeToo has served as a much-needed counterweight to these messages, a movement that tells survivors that, finally, their words matter.\n\nAs the movement matures, it\u2019s appropriate to think through how we should respond, as a society, to those words. It\u2019s not appropriate \u2014 it is, indeed, moving backward \u2014 to tell people not to speak them.", "description": "Critiques by journalist Emily Yoffe and others blame women for speaking out about sexual misconduct.", "authors": ["Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VwU3ao0JCGpa3an6z7bb5BRyqDE=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19122944/GettyImages_1042565750.jpg"}
