Flashy hires \u2014 from SpaceX, Tesla, Apple, and Ford \u2014 have mostly moved on. The $2 billion it has spent to develop a luxury SUV hasn\u2019t paid off; the vehicle is still not in production. This is all thanks to the company\u2019s founder, a man who ran from China in 2017 to escape billions of dollars of debt, only to declare bankruptcy in the US this month: former Faraday Future CEO Jia Yueting.\n\nSmart money has the company on death watch. But Faraday Future is still alive, and its new CEO would like to explain why.\n\nKey Findings Faraday Future raised eyebrows in 2014 by stealing talent from Silicon Valley and Detroit.\n\nFounder Jia Yueting came to the US in 2017 to escape billions in Chinese debt. He quietly ran the company from the beginning.\n\nIn 2017, Faraday Future made a big splash at CES with its luxury SUV. But the car still hasn\u2019t gone into production and its technology is slipping out of date.\n\nJia spent $900 million of his own money until the company was weeks from not meeting payroll in late 2017.\n\nA savior investor wanted Jia gone in exchange for new funds in 2018, but Jia stayed \u2014 causing Faraday Future to lose out on $1.2 billion.\n\nFaraday Future\u2019s mass layoffs in 2018 happened after Jia hid the the investor fight from many executives.\n\nOne way of turning the company around might be a bankruptcy. But that may change Jia\u2019s immigration status, and force him to go back to China to face his debt.\n\nFaraday Future has a new CEO, Carsten Breitfeld, who hopes to put Faraday Future back on track. But if he can\u2019t control Jia, he can\u2019t save Faraday Future.\n\nDuring a \u201cmedia day\u201d held last month at Faraday Future\u2019s headquarters, which is across the street from the Pet Haven Cemetery and Crematory in Gardena, California, newly appointed CEO Carsten Breitfeld told a dozen reporters and bloggers that he joined the struggling EV startup because he believes it can become \u201cthe number one company in future mobility.\u201d\n\nWearing black loafers, black socks, dark jeans, and a shiny black Faraday Future polo, Breitfeld flipped through slides on an enormous video wall behind him and explained in a thick German accent that the transportation industry is due for another revolution. While Faraday Future has relatively little money in the bank, owes more than a $100 million to suppliers, and has a reputation that\u2019s tarnished by Jia\u2019s financial and managerial shenanigans (which The Verge has documented over the last two years), Breitfeld claimed Faraday Future is uniquely equipped to transform transportation as we know it.\n\nIt\u2019s a bold vision Breitfeld now has to sell to investors, potential new hires, and the company\u2019s own creditors. If he succeeds, Breitfeld said the startup will return to the Consumer Electronics Show in 2021 where it will debut a new vehicle and platform that Faraday Future plans to use to disrupt the mobility industry.\n\nSurviving until then would be a feat unto itself. But in order to even try, Breitfeld must reanimate Faraday Future while keeping Jia in check. Despite the fact that Jia stepped down as CEO and filed for bankruptcy, the man at the center of the startup\u2019s greatest struggles is not going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nStorm clouds roll in, set to a sad string arrangement, before the music video cuts to footage of smog-choked China where cars appear to be backed up for miles. Then, above the strings emerges the voice of billionaire Jia Yueting, the founder of Chinese tech conglomerate LeEco and EV startup Faraday Future.\n\n\u201cWe firmly believe that the 1 percenters can make history,\u201d he says in Chinese, according to a translation of the lyrics.\n\nThen, the music video, which was distributed internally at LeEco amid the company\u2019s collapse in 2017, cuts to footage of Jia wearing black over-the-ear headphones. Standing in a recording studio, the billionaire tries to croon his thanks to \u201call the cold, indifferent people\u201d for \u201clooking at him dismissively.\u201d Their criticisms have roused him to life, he wails.\n\n\u201cWe firmly believe that the 1 percenters can make history.\u201d\n\nLater, Jia turns directly to the camera and says he\u2019d \u201clike to share this song to encourage all the entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter how crazy the thunderstorm is, as long as you are persistent and never look back, you will surely meet the vast world, or even harvest in the desert,\u201d he says.\n\nJia\u2019s brash personality, on full display in the video, is one of the reasons he made a name for himself in China. (He once compared Apple to Hitler during LeEco\u2019s rise, for example.) Jia was similarly bold in the way he built up his business, taking on billions of dollars in debt to fuel LeEco\u2019s transition from the \u201cNetflix of China\u201d to a conglomerate that made phones, televisions, and even attempted electric cars.\n\nBut Jia\u2019s ambition caught up to him in late 2016 when he unsuccessfully tried to introduce LeEco to the US. Just weeks after a blustery product launch in October, he announced layoffs and claimed LeEco was suffering from \u201cbig company disease.\u201d Six months later, after the music video was sent around inside LeEco, the Shanghai High People\u2019s Court froze $182 million of his assets. He was eventually named to an official debtor blacklist in China, and when the government ordered him to return to face his creditors, he had his wife and brother answer the call instead.\n\nWith creditors literally camping out in LeEco\u2019s offices in hopes of being repaid and the government breathing down his neck, Jia moved to California in July 2017 where he had founded a new company three years earlier: Faraday Future. He settled into a mansion on the coast, one of a handful of multimillion-dollar homes he had purchased with a shell company in 2014 and 2015.\n\nFaraday Future hoovered up talent from the biggest companies in Silicon Valley and Detroit\n\nMoving halfway around the world wasn\u2019t enough to escape the \u201ccrazy thunderstorm\u201d from his music video, though, because Jia had created another crisis at Faraday Future.\n\nAfter Jia founded Faraday Future in 2014, the startup hoovered up talent from the biggest companies in Silicon Valley and Detroit in an effort to build a luxury, ultra-connected electric SUV called the FF91. The hiring spree mixed with the startup\u2019s overwhelming secrecy to create such potent hype that, at one point, it was rumored that Faraday Future was a front for Apple\u2019s self-driving car project.\n\nBut Jia \u2014 who quietly ran the company from the beginning \u2014 spurned the advice of the automotive executives he hired and set overly ambitious goals for Faraday Future, The Verge learned in 2017.\n\nHave information about Faraday Future or Jia Yueting? Email the author at sean.okane@theverge.com, or use SecureDrop or Signal to securely send messages and files to The Verge without revealing your identity.\n\nJia quickly burned through most of the $900 million he pumped into the company. By the time Faraday Future unveiled the FF91 at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, the startup was already behind on bills, had lost some key staff, and delayed construction on a $1 billion factory in the Nevada desert.\n\nA few months later, the startup hired former BMW and Deutsche Bank chief financial officer Stefan Krause to fix its finances. He eventually decided bankruptcy was the solution. Seeing this as a challenge to his controlling stake in the company, Jia fought Krause\u2019s effort behind the scenes. Krause ultimately resigned in October 2017, and Jia named himself the first public CEO of Faraday Future, cementing what many employees already knew: he was running the show.\n\nBy late December, Faraday Future was weeks away from not having enough money to cover payroll, so Jia traded 45 percent of Faraday Future\u2019s shares in exchange for a $2 billion investment from Chinese real estate conglomerate Evergrande. But Jia still owned a third of a class of shares with more voting rights. So even though Evergrande owned a significant chunk of the company, Jia was still in charge. (Jia did not respond to an emailed request for comment.)\n\nJia stopped a former BMW and Deutsche Bank CFO from putting Faraday Future through bankruptcy in 2017\n\nIn 2018, Faraday Future spent the first $800 million of Evergrande\u2019s investment in just six months. Then Jia asked for an advance on the rest of the money. Evergrande tried to use this opportunity to marginalize the founder and asked him to transfer his controlling shares in the company to an independent third party in exchange for the money. Jia agreed but transferred the shares to his vice president\u2019s daughter. In response, Evergrande refused to make further payments.\n\nThis left Faraday Future in the lurch. Only Jia\u2019s inner circle knew about the battle with Evergrande, according to two former high-level employees who were granted anonymity due to nondisclosure agreements they signed with the company. Faraday Future\u2019s Western executives \u2014 the ones with the automotive industry experience \u2014 were left in the dark. In fact, they found out the truth just days before the company\u2019s \u201cfuturist day\u201d event on September 19th, 2018. (Faraday Future spokesperson John Schilling denies this, saying, \u201cWe were transparent with management on these types of matters in a timely manner.\u201d) At the event, executives told employees and their families that Faraday Future was still on track to start production by the end of the year.\n\nAs a result of the fight with Evergrande, Faraday Future had just $18 million in the bank at the start of September 2018, according to information shared in court in November 2018 by Faraday Future\u2019s own finance vice president. That was just $2 million more than the monthly cost of its payroll; suppliers, meanwhile, were owed at least $59 million. So in October 2018, Faraday Future began a series of rolling layoffs, furloughs, and salary reductions. Many of the top Western executives quit, including co-founder and former Tesla and Lotus engineer Nick Sampson.\n\nFormer employees say Jia hid financial trouble from executives until the last minute\n\nFaraday Future and Evergrande ultimately renegotiated their deal on the last day of 2018: Evergrande reduced its stake to 32 percent, was released from any further financial obligations, and allowed Faraday Future to seek new investors. Faraday Future finished 2018 with just $7.4 million in the bank, though it was given one final $10 million loan from Evergrande. According to Jia\u2019s recent bankruptcy filing, this loan is still outstanding. (Schilling says the startup was \u201cnot able to secure the funding we originally thought we would have by [the due date] to pay this back so we pushed it back.\u201d)\n\nNew investors weren\u2019t interested in Jia and thus weren\u2019t interested in Faraday Future as long as he stayed in charge, according to a former employee close to the investment discussions who was granted anonymity due to the nondisclosure agreements Faraday Future requires. They had good reason to be wary, this person said, as Jia once used LeEco to buy a large stake in rival EV startup Lucid Motors. This was an obvious conflict of interest and, perhaps predictably, Jia used his position at Lucid to block potential investments in that company.\n\n\u201cInvestors\u2019 primary request is, \u2018Will you just move aside and be the face, and let us run the thing?\u2019\u201d the person close to the discussions said. \u201cAnd his answer is always \u2018No\u2019 or \u2018You can get a new CEO, but they\u2019ll still report to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nBreitfeld, the new CEO, spent much of the media day acknowledging the drain that spending two-plus years in near-constant financial crisis has had on the company, while performing \u201cyes, but\u201d pivots:\n\nYes, the FF91 is still months away from production, he said, but it will outperform and out-luxe almost every other EV on the market when it hits the road. Yes, Faraday Future still needs another $850 million to make that happen, but there is value in the company\u2019s in-house technology, intellectual property, and other assets.\n\nYes, Faraday Future laid off hundreds of workers and lost key executives, and yes, many suppliers are still owed lots of money. But the restructuring firm has set up a trust for the suppliers, and the $1.7 billion the company has spent so far did not simply vanish. Much of that capital went to developing an SUV that\u2019s overflowing with the kind of technology Breitfeld thinks will help disrupt the transportation industry.\n\n\u201cOther startups are talking about the things they don\u2019t have right now, and we are not talking about the things we have. How crazy is this?\u201d\n\nIn that vein, Breitfeld said he wants Faraday Future to be more open, both about what it has and hasn\u2019t accomplished to this point as well as what he plans to do if he can successfully solicit new investors.\n\n\u201cThere was a strange attitude here, where people would say, \u2018Hey, we cannot show anything to the outside world,\u2019\u201d Breitfeld told The Verge about the way Jia ran things. \u201cThis is completely wrong, because only negative news has been out about this company, and nothing about the substance. All the other startups are talking about the things they don\u2019t have right now, and we are not talking about the things we have. How crazy is this?\u201d\n\nWhat substance? For starters, the FF91\u2019s battery pack, electric motors, and inverter have been designed and are packaged in such a way that they can be easily adapted to cars of different sizes and price points.\n\nFaraday Future developed these components of its electric drivetrain in house, too, making it something of its own supplier. This gives the company more control over the way these parts all work together, echoing how major corporations like Apple tend to design their products. That helped Faraday Future design more powerful motors that don\u2019t easily overheat, making it possible to zip from 0 to 60 over and over again. Faraday Future also claims to have developed one of the only cars with a battery pack that can match Tesla\u2019s industry-leading range figures.\n\nBreitfeld believes investors, automakers, and Silicon Valley will be interested in Faraday Future\u2019s tech\n\nThe motors and inverter are the work of the team that developed the EV1 for General Motors, which is regarded as the first mass-produced electric car of the modern era. While almost all of that team has since left Faraday Future for rival startup Rivian, their work didn\u2019t leave with them, and it remains a source of pride for the employees who\u2019ve stuck with the startup as well as a possible point of interest for potential investors.\n\nIn keeping with Breitfeld\u2019s promise of showing more work, the startup unveiled the FF91\u2019s interior for the first time. The SUV of the future is crammed full of screens: 11 total, with more than 100 combined inches of screen real estate. The centerpiece is a 27-inch display that folds down from the ceiling, offering rear-seat passengers a theater-like experience enhanced by cooling and heating systems as well as massage motors. The seats also tilt back to a 60-degree angle.\n\nThere\u2019s another large entertainment screen in the dashboard ahead of the front passenger seat, which is recessed so the driver cannot see it, the company explained. A massive vertical touchscreen protrudes from the center of the dashboard, and there are even touchscreens on the inside of each door to give each passenger quick access to their own climate and seat adjustments. Apparently, the \u201cfuture\u201d in Faraday Future means putting as many screens as possible in a car.\n\nDrivers and passengers can also interact with the car\u2019s software using voice controls, which the company says will be able to handle compound queries, such as \u201cfind a restaurant with an open patio within five miles.\u201d The car is also outfitted with a number of cameras on the inside that can recognize drivers and passengers and quickly dial in their favorite personal settings.\n\nOne problem with such a tech-dense approach is the car was supposed to be in production by now, which means some of the tech is slipping out of date. For this, Faraday Future executives offered one more \u201cyes, but\u201d: yes, that wasn\u2019t the plan, but the delay has given the remaining team time to try to work new processors and cameras into the car\u2019s design ahead of the targeted production date of 2020.\n\nThe cost, of course, is stupendous: the FF91 will be priced somewhere between $150,000 and $200,000, should it ever go on sale. But Breitfeld believes it will be an attractive car for the well-to-do in China, which he expects to be the primary market. And if things go well, which is a big if, the FF91 will just be the beginning of a comeback story that will see the startup become more than just an automaker, Breitfeld says.\n\nThe FF91 has 11 displays with more than 100 combined inches of screen real estate\n\nFollowing the FF91, Breitfeld wants to use Faraday Future\u2019s electric platform to power smaller, more affordable cars. This second-generation version of the platform, which he said will be revealed at CES 2021, is the focus of what he believes the real business opportunity is for Faraday Future: remaking ride-hailing and car-sharing with high-tech vehicles that serve as a platform for revenue-generating software services.\n\nWhile services like Uber get you where you\u2019re going neatly and safely, Breitfeld believes \u201cthe experience is quite poor\u201d during the ride. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the right product for it,\u201d Breitfeld said confidently. \u201cYour phones are not connected. You don\u2019t have access to your music, nothing. It\u2019s just sitting in and going from A to B.\u201d\n\nBreitfeld wants to solve this imagined problem by transferring the tech Faraday Future created for the FF91 to something more appropriate for these shared mobility settings. He wants a car that could recognize a user \u201cthrough facial recognition or whatever you want,\u201d and then download their \u201cdigital ecosystem into the car\u201d over 5G. This way, Breitfeld said, the car \u201cwill feel like yours within seconds.\u201d\n\nFaraday Future wants to sell a $150,000 car \u2014 and then disrupt the mobility industry\n\nBreitfeld didn\u2019t explain why tech like facial recognition is a better solution than what\u2019s already available, though. For what it\u2019s worth, Uber has a deal with Pandora and Spotify, and ride-hailing apps already know who you are when you book a car.\n\nThe screens are where Breitfeld sees the biggest dollar signs: selling services to the captive audience in Faraday Future\u2019s cars.\n\nTo hammer home this point, Breitfeld presented a slide that featured an outline of the FF91. Above the vehicle were four logos: Tesla, Google, Apple, and Uber. A fifth logo was positioned above everything else: Faraday Future\u2019s \u201cFF\u201d iconography.\n\n\u201cYou might smile or laugh a bit. But the target of Faraday Future is to bring those business models and competences together in one company, and create it and put it into one digital eco shared mobility system,\u201d Breitfeld said. \u201cTesla is building electric cars, and was the first company who really created a strong premium brand for electric cars. Google may be the best company at managing data, and making something out of data. Apple is most likely the best company when it comes to user experience. And Uber \u2014 and you could mention others like Didi and Lyft as well \u2014 making shared mobility business models work.\n\n\u201cBut what you really need to become a disruptor, and to be the next company dominating shared mobility systems in the future, is you will have to combine all of these,\u201d Breitfeld added.\n\n\u201cThe target of Faraday Future is to bring [Tesla, Google, Apple, and Uber] together in one company.\u201d\n\nBy 2030, Breitfeld claimed this super-company version of Faraday Future will generate nearly half of its revenue from vehicle sales and the rest from a combination of car-sharing, in-car services, as well as sales or licensing of the company\u2019s technology. But nearly 70 percent of the profit would come from those more service-y parts of the business.\n\n\u201cI think this can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But this can happen. And this will put us in a position that we can become definitely the number one company in future mobility.\u201d\n\nCan Faraday Future accomplish any of this with Jia still around? At the media day, Breitfeld claimed the founder won\u2019t be an issue because Jia put his controlling shares in the hands of a new committee made up of company lawyers and executives. Breitfeld also said Jia stepped down from the CEO role at his request (\u201cI told him there\u2019s only one position I\u2019d consider to come on board here,\u201d he told The Verge) and now, allegedly, has less control over the company\u2019s operations. On October 14th, Jia personally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in an effort to settle the $3.6 billion in debt he\u2019s still on the hook for in China.\n\nBut Jia still holds veto power over certain decisions, and he will continue to shape the technology in Faraday Future\u2019s vehicles as its \u201cchief product and user officer.\u201d Jia\u2019s also still drawing a significant salary from Faraday Future, according to his bankruptcy filing. Even though he pledged to take only $1 as a salary during last year\u2019s layoffs, Jia currently makes $50,000 each month at the startup. (Schilling says he \u201ccannot comment on current compensation levels\u201d for executives.)\n\nBreitfeld says Jia told him (with a kind of humility the founder isn\u2019t known for): \u201c\u2018If you come here, I\u2019ll let you run the company, because I know what I can do and what I\u2019m good at, and I know what I\u2019m not so good at.\u2019 Again, his words. And it\u2019s really a great decision, I would say.\u201d Breitfeld cites the founder\u2019s \u201cleadership\u201d and \u201cknow-how of all the digital technology\u201d as being crucial to the company\u2019s future.\n\nJia has spent his time in the US on a visa that is directly related to running a company\n\nBut even if Jia has relinquished some control, potential investors will likely have to deal with him retaining a presence at Faraday Future for one particular reason: his immigration status.\n\nJia remained in the US on an L-1 visa, according to a person with direct knowledge of his immigration status who was not authorized to share the information. L-1 visas allow companies to either transfer executives and managers to existing affiliates in the US or let those executives and managers enter the country with the purpose of establishing an affiliate. Crucially, the business \u201cmust be viable.\u201d That means without Faraday Future or his role there, Jia may be forced to return to China, where he has to face his creditors and the government.\n\nBeing in the US on this particular visa helps explain why Jia has so ferociously fought efforts to diminish his role with (or outright dissolve) Faraday Future, especially after LeEco\u2019s US operations shuttered in 2017. It\u2019s not clear whether Jia has sought a more permanent stay; a Chinese blogger in Seattle claimed Jia was applying for a green card in 2017, but LeEco executives called the information \u201cfake news,\u201d and Jia sued the man for defamation. The case was ultimately settled. (Schilling declined to confirm Jia\u2019s specific immigration status, saying only he has \u201cstatus to stay and work in the US legally.\u201d)\n\nBreitfeld\u2019s take on the role Jia now has in the company is rosy. But Jia\u2019s promises \u2014 like a $1 salary that turned back into $50,000 a month \u2014 suggest Breitfeld may have more to worry about, as no one has successfully clawed power away from Jia at Faraday Future yet.\n\nIn many ways, Breitfeld is the CEO Faraday Future always lacked. The startup spent its first three years without a publicly designated CEO (though several names rotated through the role on official paperwork, as The Verge previously reported). Even when Jia stepped in, he had no real automotive experience to speak of. Breitfeld not only has a deep well of experience from his time at BMW, but he also presumably has a sizable Rolodex from the two decades he spent there.\n\nHe\u2019s also familiar with startup chaos. After he left BMW in 2015, he helped co-found Chinese EV startup Byton, which is developing a similarly tech-forward electric SUV of its own. (Breitfeld abruptly left Byton earlier this year, and said at the media day that he wasn\u2019t happy with the level of Chinese government interference after taking investment from a Chinese state-owned automaker.)\n\nBut expertise can only get you so far when dealing with someone like Jia, who is incentivized to maintain control of his company, as the two former high-level employees allege, and blinded by the same ego that compelled him to make that music video. One of them went so far as to say Breitfeld\u2019s hiring is a \u201cscam to make people think he has stepped aside.\u201d Jia \u201chas his arm up Carsten\u2019s back and uses him like a puppet,\u201d this person said.\n\n\u201cThis comment is without merit and is baseless,\u201d Schilling says in response. \u201cCarsten has been on board here for almost two months now and has undertaken many strategic steps in his short tenure here to put [Faraday Future] back on track.\u201d\n\nSome former employees aren\u2019t convinced Jia\u2019s really stepped aside\n\nEither way, Faraday Future is saddled with debt and has nearly exhausted its resources. The company must now somehow turn into a luxury car manufacturer (or an industry-disrupting force, if Breitfeld\u2019s vision is to be believed). Even if Breitfeld or Jia has a fairy godmother who can magically make money appear, Faraday Future still needs $850 million to get the FF91 into production, according to both Breitfeld and Jia\u2019s bankruptcy filing. It will then need to find even more money to fuel the grander ambitions that Breitfeld detailed in September, which the startup plans to generate by going public.\n\nWhat cash Faraday Future does have right now has come from moves that don\u2019t inspire confidence. There\u2019s the $10 million loan from the Evergrande breakup, which Faraday Future is already late in paying. The startup sold its Los Angeles headquarters in March to generate some short-term cash, and it has since leased it from the new owners. On September 23rd, Faraday Future sold the land in Nevada where it once planned to build that $1 billion factory. The transaction price was $16.9 million \u2014 $23.1 million less than the original $40 million asking price. Citing the deal\u2019s broker, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that \u201cmultiple prospective buyers\u201d looked at the site, but \u201cFaraday wanted to close the sale quickly, which led to a reduced price.\u201d\n\nLike its founder, Faraday Future has also continued to rack up debt. It borrowed $15 million from restructuring firm Birch Lake earlier this year, which it has paid back, according to Jia\u2019s bankruptcy filing. But according to the same filing, Faraday Future also took a second $45 million loan from Birch Lake that is due at the end of October \u2014 a due date the startup is trying to extend because it can\u2019t make the payment. Faraday Future has $801 million in total liabilities, according to the filing.\n\nAs of June 30th, Faraday Future even owed $4.4 million to Ocean View Drive, the shell company Jia used to buy his mansions. In fact, Jia\u2019s bankruptcy filing reveals a number of new details like this. He borrowed $12 million from Faraday Future in 2014 to buy one of the mansions and some adjacent property. He bought another in 2015 using $7.5 million he borrowed from Lesoar Holdings, the holding company he used to make LeEco\u2019s investment into Lucid Motors.\n\nJia\u2019s being paid $43,000 per month in rent at his mansions by a company set up by his vice president\n\nIn addition to his salary, Jia is also being paid $43,000 per month in rent at his mansions by a company set up by his vice president. Jia even bought another new $3 million home in August \u2014 one month before Breitfeld was announced as CEO \u2014 with a shell company set up by his vice president, according to a person familiar with the sale and property records viewed by The Verge. The 3,300 square foot residence is just up the hill on the Palos Verdes Peninsula from the coastal mansions he already owns.\n\nJia\u2019s habit of loading up on debt and then leaving it behind, along with his propensity for questionable transactions, has already caused lawyers for one of his many creditors to call his bankruptcy a \u201csham\u201d and \u201ca flagrant abuse of US bankruptcy law.\u201d\n\nThe lawyers, from high-powered international law firm Kobre & Kim, represent a Chinese asset management firm called Shanghai Lan Cai; Jia owes the firm about $11 million. In an official response to Jia\u2019s bankruptcy filing, they told the court they believe Jia is hiding assets from creditors using shell companies and other means of obfuscation.\n\nThey also allege that some of the creditors Jia listed in his filing are companies related to or controlled by the tycoon. The lawyers claim that the legal discovery they performed after their April judgment showed that Jia \u201cemptied out at least one of his bank accounts, transferring the balance to a human resources director at Faraday Future\u201d shortly after they originally filed suit in the US.\n\nThe lawyers also allege that the plan Jia laid out in his bankruptcy filing is little more than a ruse to clear himself of liability, one that could actually pave the way for him to maintain control over Faraday Future. (Lawyers for Jia did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\n\u201cWe are skeptical of Jia Yueting\u2019s stated intentions to \u2018step down\u2019 or otherwise loosen his control over Faraday Future, given that his proposed plan says nothing about who will control the company going forward,\u201d Kobre & Kim lawyer Chris Cogburn said in a statement to The Verge. \u201cThis plan does not jibe with Jia\u2019s assurances about limiting his role in the company\u2019s future, which appear to have been just another tactic to comfort investors who are rightly wary of his track record of mismanagement.\u201d\n\nOne of the former high-level Faraday Future employees agreed, calling the bankruptcy filing \u201ca gun to the head of the creditors.\u201d\n\nFaraday Future\u2019s continuing existence depends on Breitfeld\u2019s ability to woo investors, calm suppliers, but most importantly, keep Jia in check \u2014 none of which are given. One thing was certain at Faraday Future\u2019s media day, though: through all its ups and downs, there has been no shortage of ideas, something that is reinforced by design director Page Beermann\u2019s presentation.\n\nDressed in Nike sneakers, jeans, a black jacket, and a designer T-shirt that had, among other words, \u201cdelusion\u201d printed on it, Beermann ran the members of the media through a laundry list of previously secret ideas that he and others have cooked up over the last few years. This included everything from the expected, like renderings of a Faraday Future coupe and roadster, to the bizarre, like a Faraday Future helicopter and yacht. He even showed a mockup of a lounge chair modeled after the lay-back rear seats in the FF91.\n\nFaraday Future designers have had a lot of time and money to let their imaginations run wild\n\nAt the start of his presentation, Beermann \u2014 who also hails from BMW and has stuck with Faraday Future since 2015 \u2014 read a quote from theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson: \u201cIt is our task, both in science and in society at large, to prove the conventional wisdom wrong, and to make our unpredictable dreams come true.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why working at Faraday is a dream job,\u201d Beermann said.\n\nJia was absent from the media day, but this presentation felt like the kind of thing the tycoon would appreciate. As he sang to his employees in the 2017 internal music video: \u201c[To] the people who understand me the most, thank you for silently accompanying me, and giving me a good story to tell.\u201d", "description": "Faraday Future has a new CEO with grand ambitions, former BMW executive Carsten Breitfeld.
