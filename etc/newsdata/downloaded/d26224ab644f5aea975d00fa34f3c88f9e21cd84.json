The former SolarCity operations have been a drag on Tesla, with panel installations slumping since they were acquired.\n\nDefendants asked the Delaware Court of Chancery judge to dismiss the case before it heads to a trial in March. Shareholder lawsuits that survive a motion to dismiss often settle before trial, which in this case might involve a payment to shareholders by Musk as well as money from directors\u2019 insurance.\n\nTesla did not immediate respond to a request for comment on the allegations revealed in the documents.\n\nThe suit represents another legal headache for Musk, the high-profile entrepreneur who settled a lawsuit by U.S. securities regulators last year over his use of Twitter and is being sued by for defamation by a British diver who said Musk falsely branded him a pedophile. Just last week, a Delaware judge ruled that Tesla must defend at trial Musk\u2019s multibillion-dollar pay package.\n\nAccording to the filing, Musk was informed at a SolarCity board meeting in October 2015 that SolarCity needed to raise up to $300 million and was slashing its solar installation forecast for the year. The company issued $113 million in convertible notes a month later, of which Musk bought $10 million.\n\nBy February 2016, SolarCity management told the board its cash balances were forecast to drop below amounts required for a key line of credit for several months of the year. A default on that line of credit would trigger defaults on other debt instruments, the filing said.\n\nDespite the bad news, Musk proposed the acquisition of SolarCity to the Tesla board later that month after a Lake Tahoe family vacation with his cousin, SolarCity Chief Executive and founder Lyndon Rive.\n\nSolarCity did not disclose the details of its liquidity concerns to investors.\n\nAt a meeting of Tesla\u2019s board on June 20, 2016, Musk advocated to fellow board members an initial acquisition price of $28.50 per share for SolarCity - a 30% premium to its market price - even though Tesla\u2019s financial adviser, Evercore, had recommended $25 to $27 a share.\n\nThe board ultimately approved an exchange ratio that represented a share price of $26.50 to $28.50 a share, though the offer was lowered later prior to the deal closing.\n\nOnce Tesla made the offer for SolarCity on June 21, Musk publicly recused himself from the deal. But according to the filings he held frequent meetings with Evercore and pushed investors in a series of phone calls to support the purchase.\n\n\u201cI could not be recused from all discussions ... I needed to voice my opinion, obviously,\u201d Musk said during questioning under oath by lawyers for the suing shareholders.\n\nIn the meantime, Musk assured Rive that he would \u201chave [him] covered\u201d with respect to cash needs until the acquisition closed as SolarCity \u201cwas running crazy close\u201d to its liquidity covenants, the documents said.\n\nThe companies said SolarCity accepted the offer on Aug. 1, 2016. The stock swap offer valued SolarCity at $25.37 a share, less than the initial proposal, and in line with the Evercore proposal. Shareholders approved the deal on Nov. 17.\n\nAt the time, Musk called the merger a \u201cno brainer\u201d that would create a renewable energy powerhouse, but many on Wall Street have billed it as a bailout of an affiliated firm. Tesla has since gutted its solar sales force and faced an 85% drop in installations.", "description": "Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk urged investors to approve the 2016 purchase of SolarCity at a big premium to its market value despite knowing the solar installer faced a cash crunch and publicly stating he had recused himself from involvement in the deal, according to court documents unsealed on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433123484&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M28A", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
