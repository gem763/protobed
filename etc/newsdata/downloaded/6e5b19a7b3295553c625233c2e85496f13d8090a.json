NFL's 2019 sees extremes from good teams to poor", "language": "en", "text": "ASHBURN \u2014 Dwayne Haskins wasn\u2019t fazed.\n\nTold the Redskins will be the biggest underdogs they\u2019ve ever been at home Sunday, the rookie quarterback started to explain what gives him confidence that Washington will actually be able to pull off the upset against the New England Patriots.\n\n\u201cWe have talent just like they do,\u201d Haskins said. \u201cWe just have to play our best ball. We haven\u2019t yet and when we do, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nThe NFL has been long-dubbed as a league of parity. Any given Sunday, fans like to say. But when the Redskins take on the defending champions Sunday, New England will be favored by 15\u00bd points \u2014 making the Redskins the latest double-digit underdog this season.\n\nAccording to BetOnline, including Week 5, there have been nine spreads this season that have been at least 10 points. And while that isn\u2019t a drastic increase from previous years \u2014 2018 had six double-digit underdogs through the first five weeks, five in 2017 \u2014 the disparity between the lines themselves are greater.\n\nIn 2019, there have already been five games that featured a spread of 14 points or greater.\n\nBy comparison, only two games, one in each year, met that criteria over the past two seasons.\n\n\u201cYou have these teams that are just so god awful at the bottom,\u201d said Dave Mason, BetOnline\u2019s sportsbook brand manager. \u201cWe\u2019re coming up with the props of who\u2019s going to get the No.1 pick in the draft, I mean there\u2019s just so many good \u2014 or bad \u2014 teams. You have these horrible god-awful teams and on the flip side, you have teams like the Chiefs and the Patriots that are just juggernauts.\n\n\u201cYou have that kind of recipe for humongous spreads and blowouts,\u201d he said. \u201cThese teams are bad. There\u2019s not just one or two of them.\u201d\n\nTake a quick look at the standings and you\u2019ll quickly see there are five teams that are winless this season: The Redskins, Miami Dolphins, Denver Broncos, Arizona Cardinals and Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nAt this point last season, only one team had yet to record a win.\n\nPro Football Reference, an online football encyclopedia, has tracked point spreads for every game dating back to 1978. This century, the number of double-digit underdogs has varied each year. For instance, 39 games featured a spread of at least 10 points in 2018 \u2014 while there were only 16 games in 2016 that hit that mark.\n\nBut this year, there\u2019s one glaring difference when examining how oddsmakers are setting lines.\n\nThrough the first four weeks, the average spread in games has been 16\u00bd \u2014 a noticeable jump from past seasons.\n\n\u201cDespite the number of double-digit spreads remaining the same, the average spread of these games is significantly higher this season,\u201d said Bovada head oddsmaker Pat Morrow in an email. (Bovada is an online sportsbook.)\n\nOddsmakers say it has been a challenge in setting lines for games that have been such extremes.\n\nIn particular, the Dolphins, who have stripped down their roster by trading away marquee players amid cries they\u2019re tanking, have been a combined 62-point underdog through four weeks \u2014 and haven\u2019t covered the spread once. Mason said that\u2019s an NFL record, passing the 2002 Texans.\n\nThe Patriots have also set a record by being 55-point favorites through the first month of the season, Mason said. The Patriots surpassed the 1996 San Francisco 49ers, who were minus-48.\n\nThe fact that the Patriots are heavy favorites, however, hasn\u2019t stopped bettors from favoring New England.\n\nMason said 91% of bettors for Sunday\u2019s game have sided with the Patriots \u2014 making it the most popular bet of the week.\n\n\u201cEverybody and their mother is betting on the Patriots,\u201d he said.\n\nThere could be good reasons for doing so. The Redskins rank near the bottom of the league in both offense (28th) and defense (26th), while the undefeated Patriots have only allowed one defensive touchdown this season. Oh, and the Redskins have yet to name a starting quarterback as coach Jay Gruden again declined to do so Wednesday.\n\nThe last time the Redskins were this significant of underdogs at home was in lead up to an October 1995 matchup against the Dallas Cowboys, who were 13-point favorites. But hey, Washington\u2019s fortune could soon change. An early look at next week\u2019s lines reveals the Redskins are six-point favorites against the Dolphins.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a juggernaut of a game,\u201d Mason said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
