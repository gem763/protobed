His death is being linked to an NHS listeria outbreak which has so far claimed five lives\n\nNow a coroner has lifted a restriction which banned the media from reporting that 52-year-old Mr Hitchcock died from listeria after the infection was listed as one of two causes of death - the other being liver failure.\n\nWHAT IS LISTERIOSIS? Most people that catch listeriosis, caused by bacteria called listeria, will only experience mild symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhoea. Other symptoms of the infection can include a high temperature of 38C or above, aches and pains, and chills, according to the NHS. Listeria monocytogenes (stock) as found in the pre-packaged food sold at hospitals However, more serious complications can develop in those with weakened immune systems, babies, the elderly and pregnant women. Many foods can harbour listeria, but it is usually found in unpasteurised milk, soft cheeses and ready-to-eat foods, such as prepacked sandwiches. Listeria is widespread in the environment and can be found in raw food and soil, and in the droppings of many mammals, birds, and fish. Around 180 cases of listeriosis are confirmed every year in England, according to figures. It strikes around 850 annually in the US. HOW CAN YOU AVOID LISTERIOSIS? wash your hands regularly with soap and water\n\nwash fruit and vegetables before eating them\n\nstore ready-to-eat foods as recommended by the manufacturer\n\nmake sure all hot food is steaming hot all the way through\n\nDr Robert Hunter banned the publication 'by any means whatsoever' that the businessman died from listeria until the cause of death was established under Section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981.\n\nMr Hunter did tell the inquest that it was not in dispute that Mr Hitchcock had contracted listeria.\n\nThe NHS identified University Hospitals of Derby and Burton as one of the hospital trusts affected by a patient death.\n\nThere were also two deaths at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, one at Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in Liverpool, and one at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.\n\nThree other trusts had diagnosed listeria cases linked to the outbreak with no deaths - two at Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, one case at Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, and one at East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock has previously warned there will be 'severe consequences' if there is evidence of 'wrongdoing' over the listeria outbreak.\n\nThe Good Food Chain, which supplied 43 NHS trusts across the UK as well as one independent provider, voluntarily ceased production and Public Health England (PHE) said the investigation into the outbreak is continuing.\n\nThe business was supplied with meat produced by North Country Cooked Meats, which has since tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria and also stopped production.\n\nListeria infection is rare and usually causes a mild illness in healthy people.\n\nHowever, it can have more serious consequences among those with pre-existing medical conditions, pregnant women and those with a weak immune system.\n\nThere are concerns that leaving packs sat on trolleys in high temperatures for long periods allows dangerous bugs to multiply. Food manufacturers and hospitals were warned seven years ago not to serve ready-made sandwiches to vulnerable patients, such as those with a suppressed immune system or the elderly, because of the listeria risk", "description": "Ian Hitchcock, 52, died in June after eating a contaminated meal while at the Royal Derby Hospital (pictured) - a scandal that allegedly claimed the lives of six people in the UK.", "authors": ["Martin Robinson", "Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/15/15011524-0-Ian_Hitchcock_52_died_after_eating_a_pre_packaged_sandwich_while-a-101_1572276834253.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
