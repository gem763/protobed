It opens in 3,076 theaters this weekend.\n\nThe film from Focus Features edged out both Lionsgate and Millennium\u2019s \u201cRambo: Last Blood\u201d and \u201cAd Astra\u201d from 20th Century Fox and Disney. All three films are in a tight race this weekend as the top new opener at the box office, with all three projected between roughly $16-24 million. And they have to contend with the still strong \u201cIt Chapter Two\u201d and \u201cHustlers.\u201d\n\n\u201cDownton Abbey\u201d already made $2.2 million in early sneak preview screenings, and the film opened last week internationally, where it has made $11.7 million across 17 markets. In the U.K. where the film is set, it earned the No. 1 spot and opened to $6.3 million. The Thursday preview brings its cumulative total to roughly $4.5 million domestically.\n\nAlso Read: 'Downton Abbey' Film Review: Adorable PBS Aristocrats Win the Class War, Again\n\n\u201cDownton Abbey\u201d is Focus Features\u2019 widest release since \u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d in 2017. While they\u2019re drastically different films, that movie earned $1.5 million in previews and opened to $18 million. Tracking suggests that \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d will open between $16-20 million this weekend against a budget of approximately $13 million. It currently has a score of 85% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nBased on Julian Fellowes\u2019s hit series, \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d sees the return of the show\u2019s original cast led by Hugh Bonneville, Maggie Smith, Elizabeth McGovern and Michelle Dockery as the residents and servants of the famed English manor prepare for a visit from King George V. Michael Engler directs from a script by Fellowes.\n\n\u201cRambo: Last Blood,\u201d the fifth and final \u201cRambo\u201d film for Sylvester Stallone, made $1.3 million from just under 2,900 locations. It opens on 3,618 screens this weekend.\n\nAlso Read: 'Ad Astra,' 'Downton Abbey' and 'Rambo' to Bring Box Office Back to Full Speed\n\nThe studio is projecting \u201cLast Blood\u201d to earn between $17-20 million, with independent trackers saying it is likely to top out at $24 million. That would be enough to be the largest opening for any Rambo movie, with 2008\u2019s \u201cRambo\u201d opening to only $18 million. Last year\u2019s reboot of \u201cThe Predator\u201d opened to $25 million after earning $2.5 million in Thursday previews. For another recent comp, Millennium\u2019s \u201cAngel Has Fallen\u201d made $1.5 million in previews and opened to $21.3 million.\n\nAdrian Grunberg directed the film based on a story by Stallone, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Matthew Cirulnick. The film is set four decades after \u201cFirst Blood\u201d and finds John Rambo confronting his past and unearthing his old weapons and combat skills as he\u2019s hunted at his home and seeks revenge in one final mission.\n\nFinally, \u201cAd Astra\u201d which stars Brad Pitt from director James Gray, actually came in second place Thursday and launched to $1.5 million at the Thursday box office. It opens on 3,450 screens this weekend, including 380 screens in IMAX, 340 premium large format screens and 130 D-Box/4D locations.\n\nAlso Read: 'Ad Astra' Film Review: Brad Pitt Journeys to the Edge of Space and the Depths of His Character's Soul\n\nWhile the Fox release is in the same ballpark as the other three titles, projected to earn between $18-20 million in its opening weekend, it\u2019s against a much higher budget of roughly $80 million. For comparison, \u201cFirst Man,\u201d another more melancholy astronaut film with an A-list star in Ryan Gosling, sputtered to only $1.1 million at the Thursday box office last fall on its way to a $16 million opening. Another critically acclaimed sci-fi, \u201cArrival,\u201d opened to $24 million in 2016 against a $1.5 million Thursday launch.\n\n\u201cAd Astra\u201d is a paranoid thriller in space that follows Roy McBride (Pitt) on a mission across an unforgiving solar system to uncover the truth about his missing father and his doomed expedition that now, 30 years later, threatens the universe.
