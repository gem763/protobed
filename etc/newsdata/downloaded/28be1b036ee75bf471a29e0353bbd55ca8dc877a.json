(Kate Munsch/Reuters)\n\nThe city of San Francisco has added 22 states with laws limiting abortion access to a blacklist that prevents city employees from traveling to those states on the city\u2019s dime or dealing with businesses based in them.\n\nThe ban will take effect on January 1, 2020.\n\n\u201cWe are standing up against states that put women\u2019s health at risk and that are actively working to limit reproductive freedoms,\u201d said Mayor London Breed in a press release announcing the ban. \u201cBy limiting travel and contracting with certain states, we are sending a clear message to states that disregard the right to abortion.\u201d\n\nCity Supervisor Vallie Brown said the ban showed \u201cour commitment to women, trans men, and nonbinary people in San Francisco and across the country.\u201d\n\nThe blacklisted states all have \u201crestrictive abortion laws,\u201d defined by the city as laws which \u201crestrict abortion before viability of the fetus to live outside of the womb,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nNine of the states \u2014 Alabama, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Texas \u2014 were already included in a previous blacklist for what city officials deemed laws that discriminated against LGBTQ citizens.\n\nSan Francisco city officials also drew fire from conservatives last month when the City Council passed a resolution calling the National Rifle Association a \u201cdomestic terrorist organization.\u201d The NRA subsequently sued the city, and in late September, Mayor Breed and City Attorney Dennis Herrera ruled that the resolution would have no effect on city policies.", "description": "The city of San Francisco has added 22 states with laws limiting abortion access to a blacklist that prevents city employees from traveling to those states on the city's dime or dealing with businesses based in them.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
