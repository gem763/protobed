Your nationality can change, but our blood flows from China,\" Chang said.\n\nBut he said being Chinese did not mean belonging to Beijing.\n\n\"To my generation, the concept of country is stronger. We see the Republic of China as our country. This was how I was taught,\" Chang added.\n\nHsiang Pi-chien, 100, is one of a dwindling number of people who remember the birth of the PRC.\n\nAt his retirement home for KMT veterans in the city of Tainan he recalled how he and his fellow soldiers had spent weeks in retreat to Mao's communist forces.\n\nIt would be 39 years before he returned to his home village when relations between the two sides finally began to thaw. Almost all his family were dead.\n\n\"Back then China was so poor,\" he recalled. \"Compared to Taiwan it was like heaven and earth, there's no comparison.\"\n\nTaiwan had undergone an economic miracle and was emerging from decades of repressive martial law towards the vibrant democracy it would become.\n\nBut China has since transformed itself into the world\u2019s second largest economy and a global military power, the one-party state as repressive and more in control than ever.\n\nIt is a remarkable transition Beijing will place front and centre at this week's celebrations.\n\nTaiwan heads to the polls in January and the relationship with China will dominate campaigning.\n\nBut whoever wins, it's clear party leaders will have an increasingly tough time persuading sceptical younger generations of Taiwanese -- especially as Beijing takes a hardline to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\n\"I feel it is the freedom of speech,\" said Fu, when asked to describe what separates the two neighbours.\n\n\"Unlike us they are unable to express themselves freely with some things, especially when it comes to politics.\"\n\nAnd with that she returned to her dance class.", "description": "Communist China's creation seven decades ago irrevocably changed Taiwan, but Beijing's huge celebrations this week will be met with a collective shrug on an island where people increasingly see themselves as distinct from the mainland.
