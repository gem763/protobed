Reports say its collection includes samples of smallpox, bird flu and different strains of hepatitis.\n\nIn May 2004 a scientist working in a Vektor lab at Koltsovo died after accidentally jabbing her left hand with a syringe containing Ebola.\n\nAntonina Presnyakova was an experienced researcher, who was doing tests on guinea pigs at the time, Russia's Kommersant daily reported.\n\nShe was wearing the normal protective clothing, including rubber gloves, and got immediate medical attention, but the dose still killed her two weeks later. Four officials were disciplined at Vektor over the accident.\n\nKommersant described the facility as a \"military installation\", surrounded by a barbed-wire fence and armed guards in watchtowers.\n\nCold War-era secret installations\n\nThe Koltsovo incident may fuel concern about the safety of Russia's many Cold War-era secret installations.\n\nThe then-Soviet Union - in competition with the US - had large-scale nuclear, biological and chemical warfare research programmes.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Koltsovo science town just outside Novosibirsk in central Siberia\n\nLast month, five nuclear engineers and two military personnel died when an \"isotope-fuel\" engine blew up at the Nyonoksa naval test range, in Russia's Arctic. There was a low-level release of radiation, officials said.\n\nThat incident remains shrouded in secrecy. Russia is developing a nuclear-powered cruise missile, but the Russian military did not specify the technology that was being tested at Nyonoksa.", "description": "A major research centre says no biological agents have been released from a blast and fire at a lab.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/54A9/production/_108837612_biolabfileafp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
