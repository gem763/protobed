Before the lawmakers left early, Trump managed to rail against communists, his own former Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and House speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom he called \u201ca third-rate politician,\u201d according to the Democratic leaders and sources\u2019 descriptions of the meeting.\n\nShortly after the brief, cross-partisan meeting with the president in the Cabinet Room\u2014which was convened to discuss Syria and Turkey-related matters\u2014Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) emerged to give a readout to reporters on what was, in Schumer\u2019s words, Trump\u2019s \u201cnasty diatribe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown\u2014sad to say,\u201d Pelosi told reporters. \u201cI think that vote, the size of the vote\u2014more than 2-to-1 of the Republicans voted to oppose what the president did [on troops in Syria]\u2014it probably got to the president, because he was shaken up by it [and] that\u2019s why we couldn\u2019t continue in the meeting because he was just not relating to the reality of it.\u201d\n\nSchumer asserted that Pelosi \u201ckept her cool completely\u201d even while Trump sniped that \u201cthere are communists involved [in Syria] and you guys might like that.\u201d\n\nThe president even took a shot at his former defense secretary\u2014who quit late last year over policy disagreements\u2014when the conversation on Wednesday afternoon touched on foreign policy and a potential rejuvenation of ISIS fighters in Syria.\n\nAccording to a Democratic source familiar with what happened in that meeting, Schumer at one point pulled out a piece of paper featuring quotes from Mattis\u2019 interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday. The Democratic leader began reading to the president the statement that Mattis made on that Sunday show, that \u201cif we don't keep the pressure on, then ISIS will resurge. It's absolutely a given that they will come back.\u201d\n\nTrump, this source said, then interrupted Schumer, and insisted that Mattis was \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know why?\u201d the president continued, according to the source. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.\u201d Trump also repeatedly claimed that of the ISIS prisoners who escaped when Turkish forces invaded northeast Syria (an invasion Trump all but greenlit), only the \u201cleast dangerous\u201d individuals got out.\n\nSecretary of Defense Mark Esper, asked to confirm the president\u2019s assertion that those ISIS prisoners who escape were the \u201cleast dangerous,\u201d told Schumer he didn\u2019t know, according to the source.\n\nAt one point, Trump is said to have claimed that \u201csomeone wanted this meeting so I agreed to it,\u201d despite the White House having called the meeting.\n\nPelosi, for her part, told Trump that Russia has long wanted a \u201cfoothold in the Middle East,\u201d adding that because of the president\u2019s actions, the Russian government now has it. \u201cAll roads with you lead to Putin,\u201d the House speaker jabbed, according to one senior Democratic aide.\n\n\u201cI hate ISIS more than you do,\u201d Trump shot back at Pelosi, this aide noted, with Pelosi replying, \u201cYou don't know that.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, Pelosi, in the escalating round of insults hurled between the West Wing and Capitol Hill, told reporters, \u201cI think now we have to pray for [Trump\u2019s] health. Because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.\u201d\n\nThere was even a point in this meeting, the Democratic aide said, that President Trump distributed to attendees the October 9 letter he sent to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the one that read, \u201cYou don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy\u2014and I will.\u201d Trump\u2019s letter also includes the lines, \u201cDon't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool! I will call you later.\u201d\n\nThis was taken as an attempt by the president to demonstrate to all the Republicans and Democrats in the room that he was being sufficiently tough on Erdo\u011fan, and as an effort to convince those present that he did not greenlight the Turkish invasion, which is currently causing political backlash at home, and slaughter and mayhem abroad.", "description": "Brendan Smialowski/AFP/GettyPresident Donald Trump invited Democratic Party leaders to the White House on Wednesday and proceeded to have what those leaders described as a \u201cmeltdown\u201d in front of them.
