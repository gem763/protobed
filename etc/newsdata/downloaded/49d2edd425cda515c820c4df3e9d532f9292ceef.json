These are the two teams that discovered last month a batch of 14 zero-days being used against iOS users.\n\nHowever, the Android zero-day and the iOS zero-days appear to be unrelated. While the attacks on iOS users have been linked to a Chinese state-sponsored group conducting surveillance operations against their own citizens, details about the Android zero-day are currently limited.\n\nGoogle's TAG said it believes the Android zero-day is the work of NSO Group, a well-known Israeli-based company known to sell exploits and surveillance tools.\n\nThe company has been criticized for selling hacking tools to oppressive regimes, but facing rising criticism, has recently pledged to fight customers who abuse its tools to spy on innocents or political opponents. ZDNet sent a request for comment to the Israeli company, seeking confirmation that this is one of their tools, and we'll update the article with their statement if we hear back.\n\nNot as dangerous as it could have been\n\nThe good news is that the Android zero-day is not as dangerous as other past zero-days. For starters, it's not an RCE ( remote code execution) that can be exploited without user interaction. There are certain conditions that need to be met before an attacker can exploit this vulnerability.\n\n\"This issue is rated as High severity on Android and by itself requires installation of a malicious application for potential exploitation,\" a spokesperson for the Android Open Source Project said. \"Any other vectors, such as via web browser, require chaining with an additional exploit.\n\n\"We have notified Android partners and the patch is available on the Android Common Kernel. Pixel 3 and 3a devices are not vulnerable while Pixel 1 and 2 devices will be receiving updates for this issue as part of the October update,\" the Android team said.\n\nThe zero-day is now being tracked as CVE-2019-2215. This bug tracker entry from the Project Zero team holds proof-of-concept code and additional details for security researcher who want to reproduce the bug and test other devices.", "description": "Vulnerability was patched in older Android OS versions, but resurfaced in newer releases.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/04/f3bdb5f0-1460-4831-9036-8724e5708746/thumbnail/770x578/1c2aa8ffd1260fbf577a339fed5c41ad/android-0-day.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
