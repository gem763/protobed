We attend their ostentatious weddings and parties.\"\n\nVideos have circulated of the accused men engaged in lavish displays of wealth, such as throwing a party where guests danced on a floor covered in dollar notes and having a \"champagne bath\", drenched from top to toe in the expensive wine.\n\nAlso in circulation are photos of some of them posing with top government officials.\n\nOne man on the FBI's list was on the inauguration committee of a newly elected state governor barely three months ago. The BBC has not verified the authenticity of the videos and photos.\n\nThe mocked government officials were quick to deny any close association with the accused.\n\nBut the truth is, that sometimes it turns out that the fraudsters are known to us.\n\nThey are our brothers' friends, friends' husbands, dates, or relatives who genuflect as they smile sweetly and say to us: \"Good morning, Auntie.\"\n\nA young man who was on the FBI's most wanted list for years and eventually convicted of $40m fraud in 2013, is the only son of a lovely woman I considered my mother's prettiest and most fashionable friend while I was growing up in Umuahia city in south-eastern Nigeria.\n\nThese fraudsters flash their lavish lifestyles in our faces. We attend their ostentatious weddings and parties.\n\nImage copyright EFCC/FBI Image caption Nigerian and US authorities have battled to curb cyber fraud\n\nThey are the special guests at our events. Our community and humanitarian projects benefit from their largess.\n\nBut we feel immensely ashamed when their names feature on FBI lists or when they are arrested. They become a national disgrace.\n\n\"This is double damage on every citizen of Nigeria,\" said presidential spokesman Garba Shehu, following the arrest of Mr Okeke and the other Nigerians indicted.\n\n\"It is a big scar on all of us who go out of this country and are seen in this image that these our brothers have created,\" he added.\n\nIf convicted, Mr Okeke faces up to 30 years in jail, experts say. His court case will resume in February 2020.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nNigerians are particularly worried that the scams might hamper international recognition of the country's young entrepreneurs, and the granting of visas to those with legitimate business interests in the US.\n\nThere is also that part of some Nigerians that cannot help but admire these young scammers - the ingenuity and audacity that enables them to swipe, with ease, millions of dollars from American neuroscientists, British CEOs and German scholars.\n\nImagine if these young criminals had better role models and opportunities. Imagine how much they could contribute to the advancement of humankind.\n\nMore Letters from Africa\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica", "description": "Educated youths have become involved in cyber crime after seeing uneducated scammers get rich.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nwz9h.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
