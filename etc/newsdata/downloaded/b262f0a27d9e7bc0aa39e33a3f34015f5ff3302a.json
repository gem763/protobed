I think we all understand that the Second Amendment has limits to it, just like the First Amendment with free speech does. We don\u2019t believe everybody has a right to have a nuclear weapon. We don\u2019t believe that four-year-olds ought to have guns. I\u2019m not arguing against legislation, but I\u2019m saying that one thing we can do is to quit this devaluation of human life in our society that is seen by the glorification of violence in our culture, by the mass slaughter of a whole class of citizens \u2014 the unborn. By teaching our children that they\u2019re nothing but an evolutionary accident instead of teaching our children that they are created by God, they are of value to God, and they are accountable to God for their actions. All of this is important if we\u2019re gonna solve this problem.\n\nIt should go without saying that trying to claim that teaching children basic science like the theory of evolution causes mass shootings is a pernicious anti-intellectual tactic designed to keep children ignorant in order to preserve and profit from religious superstition.\n\nIndeed, the attempt to blame anything but guns for mass shootings is a typical tactic of ignorant and mean-spirited conservative Christians. For example:\n\nHowever, conservative Christians never blame the\n\nperverse pleasure\n\nmany Christians take in owning guns, nor the current\n\nWhite-Supremacist-In-Chief\n\n, for mass shootings.\n\nAs for Pastor Jeffress, previously the conservative Christian extremist tried to link President Obama to the anti-Christ, and made the wildly irresponsible claim that \u201cGod has given Trump the authority\u201d to take out North Korean leader Kim Jon-Un.\n\nBottom line: Texas megachurch Pastor Robert Jeffress argues that teaching children evolution instead of teaching children to fear God is the source of mass shootings.", "description": "Anti-intellectual propaganda for Jesus: Texas megachurch Pastor Robert Jeffress, one of Trump\u2019s leading supporters, claims that teaching children evolution causes mass shootings.", "authors": ["Progressive Secular Humanist", "Michael Stone"], "top_image": "https://wp-media.patheos.com/blogs/sites/410/2019/08/Jeffress1.png", "published_at": "2019-08-10"}
