Put another way, the median condo buyer paid $1.51 million more this past summer than they did in 2018.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Hockney\u2019s \u2018Sur la Terrasse\u2019 Could Net $45 Million at Christie\u2019s\n\nThe report defines luxury as the top 10% of sales.\n\n\n\nBoston\u2019s high-end market stands in stark contrast to bigger coastal luxury hubs such as New York City and much of urban California, where top-end sales have slowed and average prices have declined over the past year.\n\n\n\nAs an example, there were only four-months worth of luxury condo supply in downtown Boston in the third quarter compared to a staggering 22-months worth of high-end apartment inventory in Manhattan, according to a separate report from the brokerage.\n\n\n\nBoston\u2019s townhouse market is even tighter, as the average house spent less than two months on the market in the third quarter.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the locals might say, the townhouse market in Downtown Boston is moving \u2018wicked fast,\u2019\u201d said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel and author of the report.\n\n\n\nAs a result, the median price for a townhouse\u2014a category dominated by centuries-old brick row houses\u2014was $1.352 million in the third quarter, up over 20% from a year ago.\n\n\n\nTight inventory poses a major challenge to sales moving forward, as buyers run out of options and surging prices rise out of people\u2019s reach, issues that underlie a sales downturn in other parts of the country.\n\n\n\nGreenwich, Connecticut, Sees Falling Inventory and Higher Prices\n\n\n\nElsewhere in New England, the luxury housing market in Greenwich, Connecticut, continued to stabilize, said Scott Elwell, a Douglas Elliman senior executive regional manager.\n\n\n\nHigh-end deals were up slightly from a year ago, and the median home price jumped more than 10% to $6.11 million in the first quarter even as average house size dropped, according to a separate Douglas Elliman report Thursday.\n\n\n\nMore: Developments Sporting Brand-Name Affiliations Have Tripled Since 2009\n\nFalling inventory has also helped prop up home prices in the affluent commuter town, where luxury listings are down over 20% from a year ago.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe sharp drop in mortgage rates combined with sellers understanding market conditions\u201d has helped buoy the market, Mr. Elwell said, specifically in the face of federal tax reform that weighed heavily on high-tax states like Connecticut since it was enacted in 2018.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-117825?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
