JPMorgan Says Euro Area to Be Key Equities Winner in Brexit Deal\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Euro-area stocks would stand to gain more from a Brexit deal by the end of this month than U.K. shares, JPMorgan (NYSE: ) Cazenove strategists said.\n\nWhile such a scenario would be bullish for domestic British companies, a strengthening of the pound would take away much of the upside for U.K. equities, strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note. Euro-zone shares, however, would be a \u201cbig potential indirect beneficiary,\u201d they said.\n\nJPMorgan (NYSE: ) on Monday reiterated its overweight stance on euro-area equities, while maintaining an underweight position on U.K. shares. In addition to a potential Brexit-deal boost, euro-area stocks are under-owned and trading cheaply on most valuation metrics, while speculation is mounting for fiscal stimulus in the region, the strategists said.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s benchmark has tended to move inversely to the pound since the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union, thanks to a heavy weighting of exporters that benefit from a weaker currency. Last week, a stronger pound and a slump in commodities dragged the gauge to its worst drop in almost a year.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s base case is for the Oct. 31 deadline to be pushed out to January-February, with early elections likely, but the strategists cautioned that \u201cone shouldn\u2019t ignore the likelihood that Boris Johnson gets his deal through in October.\u201d\n\nProspects of a breakthrough ahead of the deadline faded again over the weekend as talks between the two sides stalled. The EU has indicated that proposals made by Prime Minister Johnson last week to resolve the impasse won\u2019t cut it.\n\nThe has underperformed the this year amid lingering uncertainty about the timing and details of Brexit.", "description": "JPMorgan Says Euro Area to Be Key Equities Winner in Brexit Deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC5J0QC_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
