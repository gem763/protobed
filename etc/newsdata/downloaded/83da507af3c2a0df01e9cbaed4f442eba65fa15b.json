The settlement reversed a 2015 Republican-backed law that lets child-placement agencies not provide any services that conflict with their religious beliefs if they are under contract with the state.\n\nThe Becket Fund's complaint alleged violations of the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act \u2014 claims on which the plaintiffs will likely prevail, according to the judge.\n\nHIGH SCHOOL TENNIS STARS PENALIZED FOR HAVING \u2018WRONG\u2019 FAITH, SCORE RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION\n\n\u201cSt. Vincent has been with us every step of our journey: answering every phone call, coming with us to doctor\u2019s appointments, even bringing us food, as we strive to give our five beautiful children the best future they can have,\u201d Melissa Buck said in a statement. \u201cSt. Vincent brought our family together, and I\u2019m happy to know they can keep doing their great work helping children find homes.\u201d\n\nJonker, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, said Nessel's action conflicted with state law, existing contracts and established practices. She \"targeted\" St. Vincent, he said, at the \"very heart\" of the case after she made past statements referring to proponents of the 2015 law as \"hate-mongers\" and calling the measure indefensible during her 2018 campaign.\n\nMichigan, like most states, contracts with private agencies to place children from troubled homes with new families. There are currently 13,000 children in the state's foster care system.\n\nJonker, in issuing a preliminary injunction, said Lansing-based Catholic adoption agency's longstanding practice of adhering to its religious beliefs and referring same-sex and unmarried couples to other agencies is not discriminatory.\n\nWanting to cancel the contract \"would disrupt a carefully balanced and established practice that ensures nondiscrimination in child placements while still accommodating traditional Catholic religious beliefs on marriage,\" he wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Today's ruling requires the state to put the individual religious beliefs of foster care agencies ahead of the welfare of children,\" said Jay Kaplan, staff attorney for the ACLU of Michigan's LGBT Project. \"This will not facilitate foster and adoptive placements for children in need. Instead, it will allow agencies to turn away same-sex foster parents who are able to provide supportive and loving homes for these children.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Nessel said her office was reviewing the decision to determine the next steps.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Faith-based adoption agencies won a landmark religious liberty\u00a0case against the state of Michigan\u00a0on Thursday after a federal judge ruled in their favor.", "authors": ["Caleb Parke", "Caleb Parke Is An Associate Editor For Foxnews.Com.
