We\u2019ll split the analysis into three groups: very cheap, mid-tier, and expensive. A greater emphasis will be placed on the lower end of the price scale.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Stay ahead of the competition from wire to wire with rankings, customizable projections, trade evaluator, exclusive columns and more in our Season Pass. And start using optimized lineups with our DFS Toolkit!\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWe\u2019re cooking with 14 games tonight. Not a single pitcher meets my usual points per $1,000 requirement for \u201cbargain\u201d status.\n\nDIRT CHEAP BARGAINS\n\nTrent Grisham \u2013OF \u2013 Milwaukee Brewers (at Pablo Lopez)\n\nOn Monday, Grisham finally rewarded DFSers who consistently rostered him as a potential high-octane, low-cost play. He sprayed five hits in six plate appearances. The performance has pushed his price tag to the upper limits of bargain territory. He\u2019s still a value at this price against Lopez. The Marlins righty has posted mixed results since returning to action in late-August. He typically works around the strike zone. Grisham offers a full shed of fantasy tools \u2013 namely above average plate discipline, contact skills, and power. He\u2019s a fly ball hitter which matches up well against Lopez\u2019s ground ball tendencies.\n\nSam Hilliard \u2013 OF \u2013 Colorado Rockies (vs Dakota Hudson)\n\nRaimel Tapia \u2013 OF \u2013 Colorado Rockies (vs Dakota Hudson)\n\nStory continues\n\nA couple low cost Rockies could find their way into the lineup tonight. Hilliard is the better target by conventional considerations. That\u2019s because he\u2019s a left-handed power hitter with modest fly ball tendencies. Hudson is a ground ball pitcher, the sort whose stuff tends to translate poorly to Coors Field. He\u2019s likely to get less sink than he\u2019s used to, leading to shaky command and juicy fastballs. Hilliard has around a one-in-four chance to home tonight. By comparison, Tapia is quite unlikely to leave the yard. As a ground ball hitter against a ground ball pitcher, you\u2019re mostly just hoping for multiple hits. He fits better as a cheap connecting piece in a stack.\n\nRyan McBroom \u2013 1B/OF \u2013 Kansas City Royals (at Reynaldo Lopez)\n\nThe Royals haven\u2019t consistently used McBroom despite good results through 22 plate appearances. He seems to be in line to start tonight against Lopez, probably batting sixth in the lineup. McBroom is a power threat with a roughly one-in-four chance to homer tonight. He hammered 26 home runs in 482 plate appearances in Triple-A to go with good plate discipline and contact rates. Lopez is one of the most infuriating pitchers in the league. He bounces between gems and disasters with little regard for quality of opponent. As such, consider this a volatile matchup.\n\nAlso Consider: Travis Shaw, Jaylin Davis, Isan Diaz, Luis Urias, Brian Goodwin, Ty France, Welington Castillo, Ryan O\u2019Hearn, Willy Adames, Phillip Ervin, Manuel Margot, Danny Mendick\n\nMID-TIER MUST PLAYS\n\nJ.D. Martinez \u2013 OF \u2013 Boston Red Sox (at Trent Thornton)\n\nThe Red Sox offense is seemingly in a good spot to deliver some damage against Thornton and a weak Blue Jays bullpen. Toronto\u2019s starter has some long-term promise if he can hone his command. At present, he\u2019s merely effectively wild on his good days. Usually, \u201ceffectively\u201d doesn\u2019t apply. Martinez is among the likeliest hitters to homer tonight with a one-in-three chance to go deep. His ability to work counts all but ensures he\u2019ll at least deliver some production. This is a high floor, high ceiling play.\n\nAlso Consider: Ji-Man Choi, Franmil Reyes, Yasiel Puig, Harrison Bader, Kyle Schwarber, Eloy Jimenez\n\nHIGH PRICED VALUES\n\nAustin Meadows \u2013 OF \u2013 Tampa Bay Rays (at Ariel Jurado)\n\nIt goes without saying that Coors Field bats are fire emojis tonight. Rangers starter Jurado appears to be extremely susceptible to left-handed hitters. He rarely induces whiffs from lefties (4.85 K/9) and allows a massive 46.8 percent hard contact rate. For his part, Meadows has destroyed righties to the tune of .302/.388/.586. Expected to bat third in the order, the young Rays slugger could credibly deliver DFS value via power, multiple hits, and/or run production.\n\nAlso Consider: Tommy Pham, Marcell Ozuna, Paul Goldschmidt, Charlie Blackmon, Trevor Story, Nolan Arenado", "description": "Brad Johnson reviews his favorite MLB DFS bargain targets for Wednesday, September 11.
