We are expecting minimum temperatures as low as -2C (28F), even in some parts of southern England.\u2019\n\nThe weather warnings in place between noon until midnight Friday are in place for the same times today as 110mm of rain could fall over that period.\n\nMeteorologist Luke Miall said: 'We are expecting at least 100mm of rain and that is quite a lot of rain to fall in a couple of days.\n\n'There will be pretty strong winds. There will be coastal gales in parts of England and Wales on Friday.\n\n'The strongest winds will be in the southern counties along the west. The focus will be on the rain and that will be the main impact.'\n\nThe Environment Agency yesterday had flood warnings covering the lower Avon, lower River Soar in Leicestershire, north Kesteven, Rase and Upper Ancholme, the River Evenlode, the River Glyme and the River Mole.\n\nThe Met Office's warnings state: 'Rain is expected to arrive across parts of the UK during Friday and become heavy and persistent, this is especially true for high ground exposed to the strong southwesterly wind.\n\n'There remains some uncertainty to the locations likely to see the highest rainfall totals. This rain is expected to continue falling in similar areas for around 24 hours.\n\n'As such during this period 40-60 mm [1.6-2.4in] of rain is likely, with perhaps as much as 100mm [4in] over higher ground.\n\n'There is a small chance that homes and businesses could be flooded, causing damage to some buildings.\n\nThe Met Office added: 'There is a small chance of fast flowing or deep floodwater causing danger to life. Where flooding occurs, there is a slight chance of delays or cancellations to train and bus services.\n\n'Spray and flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures. There is a small chance that some communities become cut off by flooded roads and there is a slight chance of power cuts and loss of other services to some homes and businesses.'\n\nThe October average rainfall for northern England is 100.6mm (3.96in), while in Wales the average is 169.6mm (6.68in).\n\nUp to October 21, northern England has already had up to 87.2mm (3.43in) of rain, while 122mm (4.8in) has fallen in Wales.\n\nThe average October rainfall for England is 91.7mm (3.61in) and 86.9mm (3.42in) has already fallen this month.\n\nBut the Met Office said record rainfall totals for the month are unlikely to be broken.\n\nThe wettest October in northern England and Wales was in 1967, when 176.5mm (6.94in) of rain fell in northern England and 303.5mm (11.94in) in Wales.", "description": "The UK is set for a weekend of torrential rain and snow which will bring a swift end to the warm summer as clocks go back on Sunday morning.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/08/20210126-0-image-a-2_1572076631012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
