(Steve Marcus/Reuters)\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden retains a ten-point lead over Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) in a national poll of likely Democratic primary voters released Monday.\n\nBiden received support from 32 percent of respondents while Warren claimed the support of 22 percent in the SurveyUSA poll. His support was down just one point from September\u2019s SurveyUSA poll, while Warren\u2019s was up by three points. The closest competitor to either was Senator Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.), who received the support of 17 percent of respondents despite suffering a heart attack on the campaign trail earlier this month. His level of support was unchanged since September.\n\nSeveral other candidates failed to clear the 5 percent mark, including entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Senator Cory Booker (D., N.J.), and former representative Beto O\u2019Rourke (D., Tex.).\n\nPresident Trump has in recent weeks attacked Biden with allegations of corruption involving son Hunter Biden\u2019s business ties in Ukraine and China. In response, the Biden campaign has adopted an aggressive strategy to deflect attention back onto alleged abuses committed by Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s allegations do not seem to have affected support for Biden within the Democratic field, but the former vice president is currently lagging in the fundraising race, having raised about $15.2 million in the third quarter compared to Sanders\u2019s $25.3 million and Warren\u2019s $24.6 million.", "description": "Former vice president Joe Biden retains a ten-point lead over Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) in a national poll of likely Democratic primary voters released Monday.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
