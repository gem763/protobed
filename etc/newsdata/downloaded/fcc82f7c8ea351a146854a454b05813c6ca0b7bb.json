When the Volstead Act went into effect in January 1920, consuming alcohol wasn\u2019t against the law, only manufacturing, transporting or selling it was. That allowed many wealthy Americans to stash wine, beer and liquor in their cellars before 1920. But when Wilson left office in 1921 and moved to 2340 S St. NW, the 28th president needed to get special permission from Congress to transport bottles of wine and other alcohol from the White House to his new home. The wine cellar at S Street, which had been built by the previous owners, is not much bigger than a walk-in closet. Not only is it on the lowest level of the house, it also has a concrete ceiling and brick walls to keep the room temperate. The wood shelves held about 700 bottles. Although alcohol was not allowed to be sold or transported between 1920 to 1933, somehow several bottles of 1922 Chateau Haut-Brion, a 1928 bottle of champagne and a whiskey bottle \u2014 labeled \u201cFor medicinal purposes only. Sale or use for other purposes will cause heavy penalties to be inflicted\u201d \u2014 found their way into the cellar. Wilson probably did not imbibe much alcohol after leaving the White House. Up until his death in 1924, he battled the lingering effects of the stroke he suffered in 1919. But he and his wife, Edith, entertained, and no doubt served alcohol to their guests. Edith was said to enjoy bourbon. The Wilson House also has kept in its collection a bottle of the 1961 Ros\u00e9 d\u2019Anjou that was served at a lunch Edith Wilson gave for Jackie Kennedy after she became first lady.\n\n\n\nThe fallout shelter at Tudor Place was included in an addition to the garage. The shelter had sleeping quarters, left, and water tanks, right. The tunnel is through the far door.

(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nA 1816 neoclassical mansion in Georgetown is one of the last places you\u2019d expect to take cover during a nuclear attack. During the Cold War, when nuclear bombs were foremost on people\u2019s minds, fallout shelters were supposed to protect the population from their effects. The underground, enclosed spaces were designed to shield occupants from a nuclear explosion and the radioactive fallout. The U.S. government began its community fallout shelter program in 1961 when President John F. Kennedy asked Congress to allocate more than $200 million for shelters. Oyster-Adams intermediate school in the Kalorama neighborhood has one of the last remaining public fallout shelters in its subbasement. Some private citizens built their own shelters. Armistead Peter III, the last private owner of Tudor Place, added one between 1967 and 1968 as part of an addition to the garage next to the house. He wasn\u2019t the only D.C. denizen to construct a fallout shelter. Marjorie Post built four of them at Hillwood, one of which was in the neo-Georgian mansion\u2019s basement and painted pink.\n\nAccording to Tudor Place executive director Mark Hudson, Peter and his architect, Dean Philpott, consulted publications from the Office of Civil Defense, including the 1965 publication, \u201cNew Buildings with Fallout Protections,\u201d in designing the space in the garage\u2019s basement. Builder E.A. Baker built a long narrow room with lead-lined double doors to house people during the attack and its aftermath and an adjacent room to store food and supplies. Three large tanks supplied water. A small kitchen was tucked into a wall. A shower and a toilet were in a separate room. The garage also had a diesel generator that operated in the event of a power loss. A long, underground tunnel leads from the garage to a hatch that opens underneath a tree on the lawn. The tunnel\u2019s purpose and its use are a mystery.\n\n\n\nThese rooms, within steps of the White House, once housed as many as 21 slaves. They are a rare example of urban slave quarters. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nUrban slave quarters\n\nAmong the handful of urban slave quarters that still survive are these within steps of the White House. Buildings constructed to house slaves once existed in the thousands, but few remain. Most were built with cheap materials, and many were destroyed after the Civil War. But the slave quarters at Decatur House have lasted close to 200 years. They were not part of Benjamin Henry Latrobe\u2019s design for the Federal-style house. Built between 1818 and 1819 for Commodore Stephen Decatur, Decatur House was the first private residence in the White House neighborhood. Decatur died 14 months after moving in, and his widow rented the house to the French minister to the United States. A service wing was added to the back of the house, most likely to accommodate the minister\u2019s servants from France. The top floor was the sleeping quarters with three rooms. The lower level had a laundry and a kitchen. It is perhaps because they were not built as slave quarters that the building has streetside windows. A slave owner did not want people on the street to see his slaves nor his slaves to see people on the street.\n\nThe service wing became slave quarters during Secretary of State Henry Clay\u2019s residency from 1827 to 1829. John Gadsby, who made a fortune trading slaves at his Alexandria tavern and his Washington hotels, bought the house in 1836. The 1840 census recorded 10 enslaved people living at Decatur House along with two free African American men. At its peak, the slave quarters may have housed close to 21 enslaved individuals. Slavery was abolished in the nation\u2019s capital in 1862. In 1865, the federal government seized the house and turned it into the office of the commissary general of subsistence. No enslaved individuals lived in Decatur House again, but many free African Americans and immigrants resided there well into the 20th century.\n\nIce cut from the frozen Potomac River was hauled by cart to Gadsby's Tavern and stored in this ice well.

The ice well is a rare example of a commercial well in an urban environment.\n\nGadsby\u2019s Tavern ice well\n\nThe ice well, a status symbol of Colonial times, is perhaps one of the reasons Gadsby\u2019s Tavern was a gathering place for Washington\u2019s elite. Only the wealthy could afford to indulge in ice to chill their beverages, preserve perishable food and make ice cream. Some of the tavern\u2019s patrons who probably enjoyed ice from the well include George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, Marquis de Lafayette and John Quincy Adams. As part of John Wise\u2019s efforts to build a grand hotel near the nation\u2019s new capital, he wanted to provide all the luxuries of the day. He received permission from the Alexandria Common Council in 1793 to install an ice house beneath the corner of Royal and Cameron streets. According to the Alexandria government website, harvesting ice from the Potomac River was expensive and time-consuming. After it was cut from the frozen river, the ice was hauled by cart to the tavern, stored in the well and then covered with straw to preserve it. The well was linked to the tavern by a tunnel. It also could be accessed through a small hatch at street level. The well was much larger than private wells, measuring 17 feet 3 inches in diameter and 11 feet 9 inches deep. It could store as much as 68 tons of ice. In 1805, when John Gadsby leased the tavern from Wise, he sold ice to the public from the well, charging 8 cents per pound. Although a few private wells still exist at Monticello, Montpelier and Mount Vernon, Gadsby\u2019s ice well is considered a rare example of a commercial well in an urban environment. It set a standard for the nation\u2019s emerging hospitality industry.\n\nPhoto editing by Bronwen Latimer", "description": "Surprising features include the \"Prohibition President's\" wine cellar, slave quarters near the White House and a bomb shelter at a 1816 neoclassical mansion.", "authors": ["Kathy Orton", "Bill O'Leary"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uHKI634TmGa2Xh5Bl006_GWRaDE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XAWTSQGU6QI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
