We each paid half.\n\nLater, we drifted apart after my girlfriend met another man. We moved out and the property was put on the market at \u00a3400,000. Within two weeks or so, my former girlfriend moved back in, and she is still there.\n\nWe have had no firm offers. The estate agent wants to market the property at \u00a3370,000, which I am happy to do, but my former girlfriend will not agree.\n\nLoggerheads: One reader is keen to sell his and his ex girlfriend's cottage after they split up but she's moved back in and does not want to lower the price\n\nThe agent and I think she does not want to sell, as she would not be able to buy a similar property with half of the \u00a3370,000.\n\nI need the cash to help my children and for my later life needs \u2014 I am 75 and she is 71.\n\nR. P., Herefordshire.\n\nYour letter should pique the interest of anyone who has bought a property with a friend or partner and does not have a formal agreement over the sale. I'm afraid you are in a bit of a cleft stick.\n\nSolicitor Ben Tyer, of GLP Solicitors' lawyersforlaterlife.org, says that, as the property is in both names, both must agree to any sale.\n\n'Even if an offer of \u00a3370,000 was made, while you might agree, your ex-partner would need to also,' he adds.\n\n'Ordinarily, if an ex-partner wanted to stay in the home, you would ask them to buy your share, but it would appear unlikely that she can raise sufficient capital.'\n\nA last resort is to apply to the court for an order for sale. 'It has discretion and will consider the purposes the property was purchased for,' says Mr Tyer.\n\n'As it was purchased as a home for you both, but the relationship has broken down, while there is no guarantee the court will order a sale, your prospects are good, especially as there are no minor children involved.'\n\nFrom what you have described, an open market sale would bring the price down to a level recommended by estate agents. But Mr Tyer warns: 'This court option will be costly, impacting upon the proceeds you both receive, so it will be much cheaper if the parties agree.'\n\nDavid Hollingworth, of mortgage adviser London & Country, points out that your former girlfriend is disputing the price, not refusing to sell.\n\n'It may be possible to argue this is preventing the sale, but it's hard to be definitive about a correct valuation, which is in the eye of the beholder,' he says.\n\nHe suggests gathering evidence around what you think is the right price, supported by agents' valuations and recent sale prices of closely comparable homes. He says you may eventually have to take legal advice.\n\nHopefully your evidence, correctly presented and perhaps backed by a formal letter, could help you reach a compromise.\n\nStraight to the point I received a letter from the DVLA stating my driving licence was due for renewal. It told me to follow an online link, which I typed into Google. I filled in my details on what I thought was the right website and paid \u00a369.99, forgetting there is no fee for over-70s. The DVLA could not find my application. M. F., Surrey. It seems you found an unofficial website, which could be a scam. If you paid by debit card, speak to your bank and ask for a refund under chargeback rules, or make a Section 75 claim if you used a credit card. *** I bought a cabinet for \u00a330 from The Salvation Army. A day later, I told the shop I wanted to cancel the sale and get my money back, but was informed the charity did not offer refunds. I know this is not a lot of money to most people, but I\u2019m 84 and a pensioner, and it is a significant sum to me. V. W., Musselburgh. The charity says you should have been able to return your goods for a full refund as long as you had a receipt and they were in their original condition, with ticketing in place. The Salvation Army has apologised and will be in contact to resolve the situation. *** My wife and I were named drivers on each other\u2019s Direct Line car insurance policies. I cancelled mine eight months ago when I sold my car. My wife told Direct Line, but it failed to remove my car from her policy, then told us we would have to pay \u00a321.28 for the mistake to be rectified, or risk a voided policy. J. P., Anglesey. Direct Line says the \u00a321.28 payment reflects the removal of a multi-car discount on your wife\u2019s policy. But as it did not amend the details as instructed, it is letting you keep the discount as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nScottish Power increased my direct debit to \u00a354 a month based on estimated readings. I calculate I should be paying only \u00a322 per month.\n\nMy mother paid \u00a348 per month at the property until she died in May. Since then, Scottish Power has told me I am in debt, but has also issued small refunds.\n\nFrom May 30 to June 20, my average usage was 70p per day, which, over a year, would be around \u00a3255.50. So, rounded up, I use \u00a322 per month.\n\nH. C., Merseyside.\n\nLet's deal with this in two parts. First, the refunds and payment requests.\n\nYou cancelled your direct debit on May 27, so Scottish Power moved you to a non-direct debit product. Your smart meter showed you were in credit, so you were sent \u00a37.18. You then asked to go back on to a direct debit. By this time, you owed \u00a33, hence the small bill.\n\nNow to your direct debit. Scottish Power says the amount was based on the property's historic usage. You have based your estimate on your usage through June, with its longer, warmer daylight hours. Surely you would expect to use more power through the winter?\n\nThe firm has reduced your direct debit to \u00a322, but if this results in underpayment, it will be increased. I suspect you should be paying between \u00a322 and \u00a354 \u2014 it may be closer to \u00a354 in the coming months. Monitor your bills carefully to be sure you do not fall into arrears.\n\nInitially, Scottish Power did not seem to take into account the fact you were bereaved \u2014 a more personal approach would have helped. It has promised to keep an eye on your account.", "description": "My girlfriend and I bought a cottage as tenants in common in 2015 for \u00a3350,000, plus \u00a315,000 for fixtures and fittings.
