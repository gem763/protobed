There are five more scheduled this week, mostly with State Department officials, though it is unclear if they will all appear after Trump declared he Hill's interview is one of what could eventually become dozens of closed-door depositions in the impeachment probe. There are five more scheduled this week, mostly with State Department officials, though it is unclear if they will all appear after Trump declared he wouldn't co-operate with the probe\n\n\n\nWhile interviews have focused on the interactions with Ukraine, the probe could broaden as soon as next week to include interviews with White House budget officials who may be able to shed light on whether military aid was withheld from Ukraine as Trump and Giuliani pushed for the investigations.\n\n\n\nThe three committees leading the probe are understood to be seeking interviews next week with Russell Vought, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and Michael Duffey, another OMB official who leads national security programmes.\n\nFiona Hill (Michael Reynolds/EPA)\n\n\n\nThe packed schedule of interviews comes as Democrats are methodically working to pin down the details of Trump's pressuring Zelensky. Once Democrats have completed the probe and followed any other threads it produces, they will use their findings to help determine whether to vote on articles of impeachment. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she wants the committees to move \"expeditiously.\"\n\n\n\nDemocrats have already obtained documents and testimony that verify parts of an original whistleblower's complaint that launched the probe. A cache of text messages between three diplomats provided by one of the inquiry's first witnesses, former Ukrainian envoy Kurt Volker, detailed attempts by the diplomats to serve as intermediaries around the time Trump urged Zelensky to start the investigations into a company linked to Biden's son. Yovanovitch told lawmakers there was a \"concerted campaign\" against her based on \"unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\"\n\n\n\nOne of the diplomats in the text exchanges, US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, is expected to appear for a deposition under subpoena on Thursday. He's expected to tell Congress that his text message reassuring another envoy that there was no quid pro quo in their interactions with Ukraine was based solely on what Trump told him.\n\n\n\nAlso up this week: Michael McKinley, a former top aide to secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who resigned last week. McKinley, a career foreign service officer and Pompeo's de facto chief of staff, resigned on Friday, ending a 37-year career. He is scheduled to testify behind closed doors on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe committees are also scheduled to talk to deputy assistant secretary of state George Kent on Tuesday and Ulrich Brechbuhl, a State Department counselor, on Thursday. On Friday, the lawmakers have scheduled an interview with Laura Cooper, who is the deputy assistant secretary of defence for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia. It is unclear if any of those officials will show up after Trump's vow of non-co-operation.\n\n\n\nBecause of the Trump administration's edict, the Democrats have been subpoenaing witnesses as they arrived for their interviews - a move sometimes known as a \"friendly\" subpoena that could give the witnesses additional legal protection as they testify. Both Yovanovitch and Hill received subpoenas the mornings of their testimony.\n\n\n\nOne witness who may not be called before Congress is the still-anonymous government whistleblower who touched off the impeachment inquiry. Top Democrats say testimony and evidence coming in from other witnesses, and even the Republican president himself, are backing up the whistleblower's account of what transpired during Trump's call with Zelensky. Lawmakers have grown deeply concerned about protecting the person from Trump's threats and may not wish to risk exposing the whistleblower's identity.\n\n\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said on Sunday it \"may not be necessary\" to reveal the whistleblower's identity as the House gathers evidence. He said Democrats \"don't need the whistleblower, who wasn't on the call, to tell us what took place on the call\" and said the \"primary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected.\"\n\n\n\nTrump himself, of course, has shown no signs of backing down:\n\n\n\nRepublican lawmakers have aimed their ire at Democrats and the process, saying Pelosi should hold a vote to begin the inquiry and hold the meetings out in the open, not behind closed doors.\n\n\n\n\"The tragedy here and the crime here is that the American people don't get to see what's going on in these sessions,\" said Ohio congressman Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform panel.\n\nAdditional reporting by AP", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s ex-national security\u00a0adviser John Bolton urged former Russia adviser Fiona Hill to warn the White House about a campaign to pressure Ukraine orchestrated by the president\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, describing the latter as\u00a0a \u201chand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up\u201d.", "authors": ["Joe Sommerlad"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/08/donald-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
