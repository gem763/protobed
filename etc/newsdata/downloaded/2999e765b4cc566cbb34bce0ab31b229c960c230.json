In the last four years though, he\u2019s traveled around the parts of the country that rarely show up in the national conversation: Sioux Falls, SD, Holland, MI, Abilene, TX, and many more.\n\nHe and his wife Deborah flew their small plane to communities around the country and tried to learn all they could about them. Finding an under-represented part of the American experience, they kept going to more and more places. What began as a project of a few months became a years-long travelogue that recounts some of the surprising ways small town America has weathered (and embraced) change.\n\nHe joins Isaac Dovere to compare notes on their time reporting outside major cities\u2014and explain why he\u2019s found cause for optimism.\n\nListen for:\n\nHow Isaac\u2019s experience on the campaign trail compares to Jim\u2019s experience (and why they get such different responses asking about national and local issues)\n\nHow Jim\u2019s years reporting in China made him want to explore more of his own country\n\nWhy the 2016 deluge of post-election stories from midwestern diners described a divided nation and \u2018American carnage\u2019 (and why Jim thinks the picture isn\u2019t so dire)\n\nVoices:\n\nEdward-Isaac Dovere (@IsaacDovere)\n\nJames Fallows (@JamesFallows)", "description": "James Fallows spent decades covering national politics.
