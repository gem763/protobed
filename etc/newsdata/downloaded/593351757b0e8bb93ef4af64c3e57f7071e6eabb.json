She became a boxing sensation in 2011 after turning professional while still in high school. She won the South African bantamweight title the same year while in Grade 12.\n\nShe defended the title successfully five times, vacating it in 2016. In 2017, she won the WBF title, which she vacated this year. Nonina has won the woman boxer of the year award twice in a row at the SA Boxing Awards.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a challenger again and I wanted to grow as a boxer,\u201d Nonina said when asked why she vacated the title. \u201cI know I am the best.\u201d\n\nThe 28-year-old, who is rated number five by the IBF, says she is fired up to get back into the ring in December. She is now under the stewardship of Ngcoza after she parted ways with long-time trainer Emmanuel Mutav-hatsindi, which saw her train in Limpopo for almost six years and win the WBF title.\n\n\u201cWe are auditioning other trainers,\u201d said Ngcoza this week.\n\nHe hinted that either Phumzile Matyila or Ncedo Cecina from Gauteng and the Eastern Cape, respectively, may get the job.\n\nHe said his boxer needs a trainer to guide her to the world title.\n\nBoth boxer and manager expressed their jubilation on how well they have workedtogether since April. In the absence of a trainer, Ngcoza has swapped his management suit for a gym tracksuit, employing new and challenging ways of training. They spend more training time outdoors.\n\nNonina also has new promoters, Elias Tshabalala and Fanakhe Tshabalala of Fantastic 2 Boxing Promotions, who organised her recent fight.\n\n\u201cI dedicate last weekend\u2019s win to Baby Lee,\u201d she said, referring to the passing of her friend, boxer Leighandre \u201cBaby Lee\u201d Jegels.\n\nThe 25-year-old Jegels was allegedly shot dead by her former boyfriend in August.\n\nHer death devastated Nonina, and she took a break from training for a week.\n\nBorn and bred in Dutywa in the Eastern Cape, Nonina later moved to North West with dreams of becoming a Banyana Banyana star, but she was shattered when she failed to make the cut during trials.\n\nHer father Million Nonina, a former amateur boxer, introduced her to boxing in 2010, and she has not looked back. She has also taken the fight outside the ring, raising issues affecting women boxers.
