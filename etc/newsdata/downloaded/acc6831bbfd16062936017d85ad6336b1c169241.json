He was a medal favorite.\n\nConlan was confident. You could tell by watching the way he jigged his way to the ring for his quarterfinal clash against his Russian opponent Vladimir Nikitin. Irish tricolour flags bobbed up and down in a crowd in which his mother, father, and fiancee were watching, waiting, for Conlan to box his way into the semifinal of the Olympics to fight for yet another medal.\n\nThe fight was an aggressive one. But for every punch Nikitin threw, Conlan seemed to land two. He was too fast, too active, and was able to bloody Nikitin at will.\n\nBy the end, Conlan had barely broken a sweat. But Nikitin, bruised and battered, still won the bout, judges decided. Conlan's Olympic dream was over.\n\nBefore he left the ring he flipped his middle fingers at the judges and had choice words for the entire amateur boxing industry. He wasn't going to leave quietly. F--- 'em, he thought.\n\n\"My dream has been shattered now,\" Conlan fumed to RTE on his way out of the arena. \"They're known for being cheats. And they'll always be cheats. Amateur boxing stinks from the core right to the top.\"\n\nConlan flipped his fingers during the Olympics.

He was forced to withdraw from the semifinal because of injury.\n\nThe Guardian quoted a senior official at the time who said boxing at the 2016 Games proved \"corruption is alive and well.\" The Irish Times even reported in 2018 that the Irish boxing team was told before the fights that the medals had been pre-determined. The fights were apparently fixed, and it was all a sham.\n\nConlan is not the only pro boxer to rue the last leg of his amateur journey. Floyd Mayweather was \"robbed\" at the 1996 Olympics and Roy Jones Jr. was \"cheated\" out of the gold medal in 1988.\n\nBut fast forward to 2019 and Conlan has been given an opportunity that Mayweather and Jones Jr. never received \u2014 revenge against the other fighter, the one who escaped with the dubious win.\n\nI watch that and let that feeling build to help motivate me, push me, and relight that fire of those feelings of why this cannot happen again.\n\nConlan recently got a call telling him he was going to fight Nikitin again, this time as a pro. It's all booked for December 14 at Madison Square Garden in New York.\n\nThe Conlan vs. Nikitin battle is one fight in a studded card topped by Terence Crawford's welterweight world title defense against Egidijus Kavaliauskas.\n\n\"It's very, very sweet to get the news,\" Conlan told Business Insider. \"Everybody thinks the story is perfect, that I'm just going to win it, right the wrong that should never have been written. That's not the case. The case is this fella has beat me twice.\n\n\"No matter what, if you think the decision was wrong or you think it was right, this guy has beat me twice. In the Olympics, yes I thought I won and I showed why, but he beat me before as well. I've got to go into this fight thinking it's not a given.\"\n\nRead more: Conor McGregor's coach still thinks he's the best fighter in the world despite his heavy beating by Khabib Nurmagomedov\n\nIn Conlan's corner is the \"Dark Lord\" of British boxing Adam Booth, a strategist renowned for training and cornering the former two-weight world champion David Haye and the former super middleweight world champion George Groves.\n\nBooth and Conlan expect a more aggressive Nikitin than the Irishman experienced as an amateur. \"Adam was saying he has improved from the amateurs, a little more reckless, thinking, 'This isn't the amateurs anymore, I can go in, do what I want and throw bombs.' He tries to take your head off.\"\n\nHe added: \"But what I'm going to enforce against him will work beautifully, and it will be a really exciting fight for fans.\"\n\nWhile Conlan said he hasn't been watching too much footage of Nikitin's fights to prepare for the December 14 showdown, he has been watching the 2016 Olympics, his post-fight interview with RTE, and the recorded reactions of his family in the crowd. He wants to recapture the emotion of having his gold medal dream shattered.\n\n\"I watch that and let that feeling build to help motivate me, push me, and relight that fire of those feelings of why this cannot happen again.\"\n\nHis trainer, Booth, will likely play on those emotions during their training camp. \"He's good at getting in your head, Adam, as your coach. He knows the things to target to help push you, and his tactical abilities are unbelievable.\"\n\nIf it sounds like this is all personal, that's because it is, even though Conlan stresses that he doesn't have anything against Nikitin, more the situation.\n\n\"It's not personal with Vladimir Nikitin but it's personal in terms of my career, the history of my career, and when I look back, the legacy of it. It will look beautiful when I fix what shouldn't have happened. But this could go absolutely wrong so I've got to put the work in to make sure the happy end to this story does come true.\"\n\nConlan's story is already filled with iconic moments and it's all down to the Law of Attraction, he says\n\nConor McGregor walked Conlan to the ring for the boxer's pro debut in 2017. Photo by Ed Mulholland/Getty Images\n\nNot yet a contender, Conlan remains at the prospect level in world boxing, albeit a blue-chip one. He is 12 fights into his professional career, with seven knockouts, unbeaten.\n\nNot content with the iconic middle finger salute in Rio, Conlan has masterminded multiple moments like that in the paid ranks \u2014 from having the former UFC champion Conor McGregor walk him to the ring for his professional debut at Madison Square Garden, New York in 2017, to generating an extraordinary atmosphere inside the Marquee in Falls Park, Belfast earlier this year.\n\nRead more: What whiskey 'unicorn' Conor McGregor is actually like, according to his Proper No. Twelve business partner\n\nThese moments have helped bring him to the forefront of boxing's media, pushing him ever closer to where the big money lies \u2014 being a future crossover star.\n\nHe told us he thinks these moments into reality using the same technique as McGregor. It is the Law of Attraction at work, Conlan said \u2014 a New Thought philosophy which is the apparent ability to attract into our lives whatever it is we are focusing on by using visualization techniques. It's the idea that positive thoughts bring positive experiences.\n\n\"You attract what you put out there,\" Conlan said.\n\n\"Even the McGregor thing itself, the entrance, and the atmosphere, before I even started boxing I envisioned these things. Before my debut, this was what I want to do, big entrance, music on, complete atmosphere when I walk to the ring.\n\n\"My brother Jamie, who was already professional at the time, he said, 'Are you stupid? You don't get s--- like this in your pro debut.' And I was just, 'This is what I want to happen.'\n\n\"It all ended up happening. It got even bigger with McGregor being involved. The first time I met him, I'll be honest, it's the only time I've ever been starstruck and I've met a lot of famous people.\n\n\"But the reason I got starstruck was because of who he was, how big he is. He was in the peak of his sport at the time and he was so down-to-Earth, so humble, and so nice. I was like \u2026 it blew me away.\n\n\"There's things, how my career is going, they're not randomly happening,\" Conlan said. \"I feel like I've brought it into existence by thinking about it and processing how to make it happen.\"\n\nWatch his Belfast ringwalk in August, 2019, below:\n\nHis peers say he's 'a top class athlete' destined 'for a world title'\n\nWhen Business Insider visited the Colosseum gym in the Ballyfermot district of Dublin recently, two of the fight club's most prominent athletes \u2014 Luke Keeler and Davey Oliver Joyce \u2014 had high praise for Conlan.\n\nThe 32-year-old featherweight Joyce, an 11-1 boxer with eight knockouts, has trained and sparred with Conlan. \"He's one of the best athletes I've shared a ring with,\" Joyce said. \"His personality shows it all. The way he acts, the way he behaves, and the way he controls himself in the ring. He's a top class athlete.\"\n\nThe middleweight fighter Keeler, who is plotting a way to entice McGregor into a boxing ring, also lauded Conlan. \"He's a special talent,\" Keeler told us. \"When he steps up, you'll see his level rise. He's set for a world title.\"\n\nRead more: An Irish boxer is challenging Conor McGregor to 'stay sober' long enough so they can end their war of words and fight for a world title\n\nConlan certainly has the backing as he is represented by Top Rank, a boxing promotional company in its 46th year, which helped shape the careers of Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar de la Hoya, Manny Pacquiao, and Floyd Mayweather.\n\nMayweather even tried to sign Conlan to his stable at Mayweather Promotions, but Conlan said he never took the offer seriously. There were superior firms vying for his signature, he said. \"They put interest in me but they were a team I was never going to sign with,\" Conlan said. \"I don't believe they're a good promotional set-up. Top Rank are.\"\n\nTop Rank will help shape Conlan's career, but he does have ideas on the direction he would like to see it go in, including a blockbuster bout against the wildly popular British fighter Josh Warrington, the tough Mexican world champion Leo Santa Cruz, and even a stadium fight in Ireland.\n\n\"Josh Warrington has a big fanbase and his boxing style is suited to me,\" Conlan said of the current IBF featherweight champion. \"It would be a pleasure to watch as a fan, and even as a fighter.\"\n\n\"Leo Santa Cruz I'd like as well. He would be a big name. Whether it's the US or in Ireland, no problem.\"\n\nConlan continued: \"One day, 100% I'd also love to fight at Croke Park. It's the biggest stadium in Ireland, one of the biggest in Europe. It would be unbelievable \u2026 the biggest thing.\"\n\nNo doubt, knowing Conlan, he's already visualized his entire career. When it comes to those iconic moments, the middle fingers, the McGregor walkout, and the Belfast atmosphere, Conlan may well only be getting started.\n\nBut first he fights Nikitin on December 14. And that, for Conlan, is personal \u2014 for his career, and his legacy.\n\nRead more:\n\nConor McGregor is linked with comeback bouts against 4 fighters only weeks after being considered an 'irrelevant' has-been\n\nThe real Tyson Fury is quiet, shy, and introverted, according to an Irish boxer who knows him well\n\nTake a look inside the new and improved Straight Blast Gym where John Kavanagh trains Conor McGregor and James Gallagher", "description": "Michael Conlan stuck his middle fingers up at the corrupt amateur boxing system in 2016, turned pro, and is now regarded as Ireland's best prospect.", "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dad7f29cc4a0a2ade3ec054?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
