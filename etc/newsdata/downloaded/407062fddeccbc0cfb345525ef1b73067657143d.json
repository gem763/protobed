CBA, the company\u2019s biggest holding, is worth $639 million alone.\n\nMr Freeman said increased capital requirements, compliance and regulatory costs were to blame and \u201ceach year they tack on more and more costs\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBanks take risks and needed to deliver an acceptable return on capital in order to remain investable, Mr Freeman said.\n\nBendigo Bank chairman Robert Johanson said bank boards needed to push back against Canberra. AAP\n\n\u201cThe interest rate cuts have a significant impact on their margins and their returns and they need to protect the interests of shareholders.\u201d\n\n\"We are going into uncertain times here and during the global financial crisis many Australian businesses required recapitalisation, and Australian people having confidence that they are investing in a good sound businesses was a part of that.''\n\nShared pressures\n\nOutgoing Bendigo and Adelaide Bank chairman Robert Johanson said all banks were facing the same pressures.\n\nHe said the bank carefully considered its range of stakeholders including shareholders, employees, borrowers and savers every time.\n\n\u201cEvery marginal dollar we get \u2013 it\u2019s a contest as to which of those stakeholders get that dollar,\u201d Mr Johanson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Johanson said shareholders needed to be protected too, backing AFIC\u2019s observation about their willingness to contribute to capital raisings during the GFC.\n\nHe said it was up to the bank boards to push back against the government\u2019s populist bank bashing but said they would be reluctant following the bollocking dished out by the Hayne royal commission.\n\nAPRA chairman Wayne Byers said our banks compared favorably to those in Europe. Louie Douvis\n\n\u201cYou can understand why the prime minister might accuse the banks of profiteering for not passing it on, but it is the responsibility of bank boards to say \u2018No, we are responsible for running a business that survives through those political cycles and the news cycle\u2019.\u201d\n\nMr Johanson also pointed out the irony in being told by Canberra to keep the loans flowing.\n\n\u201cThe treasurer is out there saying \u2018We want you to lend money\u2019. These are the same institutions that a year or two ago were said to be out of control and had to be reined in and restricted because it\u2019s a feeding frenzy out there and people are getting inappropriate loans.\u201d\n\nThe support for strong banks backed the position of Australia\u2019s chief banking regulator, who last month drew a direct line between the strength of the banks and the overall health of the economy.\n\nAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority chairman Wayne Byres accepted in a September speech that the return on equity of Australian banks was higher than elsewhere but said this was no cause for alarm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe return on equity of Australian banks reached a high of 20 times before the global financial crisis and fell to around 10 times in the aftermath. They recovered strongly and more recently eased to around 12 times, he said.\n\nEuropean banks on the other hand struggled both during the GFC and in its aftermath, Mr Byers said. They are still yet to recover and he noted many were barely able to deliver an ROE of more than five times.\n\nWhile strong banks helped facilitate strong economies the reverse was also true, presenting a risk at a time when Australian banks faced considerable headwinds, Mr Byers said.\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s ongoing economic prosperity has therefore been supported by a functioning banking system, intermediating savings and credit within the economy as needed,\u201d Mr Byers said.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, parts of Europe continue to suffer from a banking system that remains fragile, and in places heavily dependent on on-going public sector support in one shape or form.\u201d\n\n'Not a good outcome'\n\nBut Treasurer Josh Frydenberg was not backing down.\n\n\"The banks have decided to put their profits before their customers, and that\u2019s not a good outcome for their customers or the economy,\" he said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the government was implementing policies to increase competition to ensure that consumers can get a better deal.\n\n\"The government is making significant progress on empowering customers to make informed decisions with the passage of the Consumer Data Right and expanding the credit reporting regime.\"\n\nHe said the Consumer Data Right allowed customers to securely transfer their banking data to other service providers in order to solicit the best possible deal.\n\n\"The government now requires the banks to appear before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics each year, giving them the opportunity to transparently account for their decision making and how they balance the needs of borrowers, savers, shareholders and the wider community.\u201d\n\nwith John Kehoe", "description": "The fund manager who helped the Morrison government win the unwinnable election says attacks on the banks for profiteering are wrong.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2758%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_206/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7e5d7504fa14cbedae7563a69bb60c6b7b5da60c", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
