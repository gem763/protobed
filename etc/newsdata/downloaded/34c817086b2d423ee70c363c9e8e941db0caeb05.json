Their stories include claims of rape, other sexual misconduct, emotional manipulation, threats to ruin their lives and promises of modeling work with Victoria's Secret.\n\nOne accuser said that she fled Epstein's clutches when he groped her, and tried to use a sex toy on her. Afterward, one of Epstein's employees warned the girl \"to be careful, that Mr. Epstein knew powerful people including Bill Clinton.\"\n\nLawyers for the victims said there were many more women who were abused by Epstein than were in the courtroom.\n\nSarah Ransome, another accuser, urged prosecutors during the hearing, \"Please, please finish what you have started ... we all know he did not act alone.\"\n\n\"We are all survivors, and the pursuit of justice should not abate,\" Ransome said.\n\nAnother accuser, who did not disclose her name, told Judge Richard Berman on Tuesday, \"It didn't feel good to wake up that morning and hear he allegedly committed suicide.\"\n\n\"I still feel like I'm learning the ways he's impacted me,\" that woman said.\n\nA third woman, who also did not give her name, said, \"I think that many of us will never heal from what happened to us.\"\n\n\"As destructive as that relationship was and as much of a villain as we've created him to be, based on facts, we've created him to be a villain, but he's a complex villain.\"\n\nAt the time of his death from hanging, Epstein, 66, was accused of child sex trafficking by prosecutors, who said he had sexually exploited many minor girls from 2002 through 2005 at his luxurious residences in Manhattan and Florida.\n\nProsecutors said his abuse was abetted by a number of unidentified conspirators who helped provide him with a stream of young girls and women to satisfy his sexual obsessions.\n\nThe case against Epstein mirrored allegations investigated more than a decade ago by federal prosecutors in Florida and state prosecutors there.\n\nAfter that investigation, the federal prosecutors declined to file serious charges against Epstein in exchange for his agreement to plead guilty to relatively minor state-filed prostitution-related charges, for which he served just 13 months in jail.", "description": "Jeffrey Epstein's death will not stop the effort to get \"justice for the victims in this case,\" a prosecutor said.
