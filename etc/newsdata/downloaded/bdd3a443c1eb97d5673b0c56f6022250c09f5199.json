REUTERS/Bruno Kelly\n\nDestruction of the world\u2019s largest tropical rainforest totaled 7,854 square kilometers (3,032 square miles) for January to September, according to the country\u2019s space research agency INPE. That\u2019s 10 times the area of New York City.\n\nFor September alone, INPE data showed deforestation rose 96% from a year ago, an easing from the more than 200% year-on-year rises recorded in July and August. In terms of area, the month of September accounted for 1,447 square km of forest cleared, down from a peak of 2,255 square km in July.\n\nResearchers and environmentalists blame right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for emboldening loggers by calling for the Amazon to be developed and for weakening the environmental agency Ibama.\n\n\u201cDeforestation is continuing at a pace that is double that of years past. I think this is because of the messages the president continues to send,\u201d said Tasso Azevedo, coordinator for deforestation mapping initiative MapBiomas.\n\nBolsonaro and Environment Minister Ricardo Salles have said previous governments are the culprits for the rise in deforestation, saying policies including budget cuts at agencies like Ibama were in place well before the new government took office on Jan. 1.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s office, Salles and the Environment Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA rash of fires in August tore through the Amazon at the fastest rate since 2010, provoking a global outcry and leaving world leaders questioning why Brazil was not doing more to protect the rain forest. Separate INPE data released last week showed that the fires receded in September.\n\nScientists say that the fires are linked to deforestation, with people often clearing the forest of valuable timber and then setting fire to the remains in order to clear the land for ranching or farming.\n\nDeforestation generally peaks in the dry season, which runs from roughly May to September but can vary by several weeks each year. This year, the rainy season is a bit late and just getting underway this month across the region.\n\nThat will bring some relief in the short term, but experts are already looking ahead to further deforestation next year.\n\n\u201cThe big question now is what will be done to prevent this next year,\u201d said Paulo Barreto, a researcher affiliated with the non-governmental organization Imazon.", "description": "Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon jumped for the fifth straight month in September compared with last year, with destruction up 93% in the first nine months of the year, according to preliminary government data published on Friday.", "authors": ["Jake Spring", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439736152&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1JL", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
