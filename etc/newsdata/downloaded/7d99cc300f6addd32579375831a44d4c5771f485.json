Reuters TV via REUTERS\n\nThe girls and women, aged from 15 to 28, had been brought from all over Nigeria with promises of work, Lagos police said on Monday. Four babies were also found.\n\n\u201cBaby factories\u201d, as such premises are widely known, are most common in parts of eastern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe young women were mostly abducted by the suspects for the purpose of getting them pregnant and selling the babies to potential buyers. The girls were tricked with employment as domestic staff in Lagos,\u201d said Lagos police spokesman Bala Elkana.\n\n\u201cBoys are sold for 500,000 naira ($1,630) and girls for 300,000 naira ($980).\u201d\n\nThe girls and women were brought to Lagos from the southern and eastern states of Rivers, Cross River, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Abia and Imo.\n\nElkana said the raid had taken place on Sept. 19 but had been kept secret to enable the police to apprehend suspects.\n\nTwo women aged 40 and 54 were arrested in connection with the case and police were still looking for a third.\n\nOne of the freed women, who did not want to be named, said she had been impregnated by her boyfriend and told by her aunt that there was a job for her in Lagos.\n\nShe said a woman to whom she was introduced had induced her labour when she was seven months pregnant.\n\n\u201cAfter being in labour for three days, that was when police raided the place and took all of them. The baby came out weak and finally died,\u201d she told Reuters.\n\nElkana said the state criminal investigation department would take over the case and was working with other agencies to resettle the women and girls and their babies.\n\nLast week, around 400 boys and men, some as young as five and many in chains and scarred from beatings, were rescued from a building in the northern city of Kaduna that purported to be an Islamic school.\n\n($1 = 305.9500 naira)", "description": "Police in Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, have freed 19 women and girls who had mostly been abducted and impregnated by captors planning to sell their babies.", "authors": ["Seun Sanni", "Angela Ukomadu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435794325&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF90251-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
