The good news is that there is a path to that goal\u2014a goal that everyone shares\u2014that is widely agreed on and \u2026 it\u2019s free!\n\nNational Parents Organization researchers evaluated the statutes of all 50 states and the District of Columbia to determine the degree to which those laws promote the well-being of children by encouraging separated parents to share as equally as possible in rearing their children. NPO then graded the states\u2019 statutes based on 21 factors that encourage or discourage shared parenting.\n\nThe 2019 NPO Shared Parenting Report Card contains some good news but, overall, the news is depressing. The average grade for all of the states is a disappointing \u2018C-\u2019.\n\nCRYING BOY COMFORTED BY BUS DRIVER IN TOUCHING PHOTO FROM FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL\n\nMore than a quarter-century of high-quality research shows that children of divorced and separated parents do best when both parents share parental responsibilities roughly equally\u2014when children do not suddenly find themselves with one overburdened parent and one \u201cevery other weekend visitor.\u201d In light of this research, state legislatures should be doing everything they can to encourage this equal co-parenting. It should be the presumed post-separation parenting arrangement.\n\nMost states are missing golden opportunities to improve the lives of children whose parents live apart. What makes this especially distressing is that the path to improvement is not only strongly supported by scientific research. It is, as the Report Card documents, widely supported by Americans from across the political spectrum, regardless of age, race, and gender. And, did I mention, it\u2019s free!\n\nAll we need to do is quit casting aside resources that can benefit our children. Those resources are the love, care, and hands-on rearing that both parents can provide, regardless of whether they are living together or not. Let\u2019s stop overburdening one parent and sidelining the other. Children need both parents fully engaged with them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAnd a presumption of strongly shared parental responsibilities when parents separate fits best with the modern family lifestyle, too. Parents in intact families increasingly share the responsibilities of raising the children and financially supporting the family. Our post-separation parenting norms should reflect this arrangement.\n\nWhile many states are falling down in this area, some are forging the path to excellence. As a result of NPO-led legislative efforts in Kentucky, for example, that state has moved from a dismal \u2018D-\u2019 to a straight \u2018A\u2019 in just three years. Kentucky legislators nearly unanimously passed laws creating a presumption of post-separation co-parenting. These laws have proven extremely popular with the public and there is now evidence that they are reducing the trauma of divorce for families experiencing this difficult transition.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLegislators in other states, some of which are sadly lagging very far behind the times, should look at states like Kentucky, or Arizona, which also does well in this regard. There\u2019s much to be learned from their successes.\n\nA \u2018C-\u2019 average is just not good enough\u2014not when it\u2019s our children\u2019s well-being that\u2019s at stake. And especially when there is public consensus on a free path to earning an \u2018A\u2019.", "description": "Most states are missing golden opportunities to improve the lives of children whose parents live apart.", "authors": ["Donald Hubin", "Ph.D. Is A Professor Emeritus Of Philosophy At The Ohio State University", "Founder", "Director Emeritus Of The Osu Center For Ethics", "Human Values", "Interim Chair Of National Parents Organization."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/dad-and-son-istock-large.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
