According to a Phaidon, which will drop the book on October 10, the 504-page visual autobiography will include over 1,000 photographs of her \u201clife as a musician, performer, designer, and entrepreneur\u201d many which have never been seen. The book, appropriately, is also called Rihanna, lest we become confused.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very grateful to the talented photographers and artists who contributed. We\u2019ve been working on the book for over five years, and I\u2019m really happy to be able to finally share it with everybody,\u201d Rihanna said in a statement. Five years is a long time in the life of one of the most photographed women on the planet \u2014 in that time she even appeared on the cover of i-D, photographed by Paolo Roversi, along with the many paparazzi shots of her drinking wine on the street.\n\nLast month, Cardi B reportedly paid $111K for a signed copy during a charity auction at Rihanna\u2019s annual Diamond Ball, which benefits her Clara Lionel Foundation that funds education and emergency response programs around the world. While it seems like a small price to pay for an intimate look into the multi-talented star\u2019s life, fans can get their own signed copy for a steal at $5,500.\n\nWhile it\u2019s starting to feel like she\u2019ll release anything other than her new album \u2014 she\u2019s started her fashion house with LVMH, unleashed the Savage X Fenty spectacle upon the world, and upended the beauty industry with Fenty Beauty in the years since Anti. Is there anything Rihanna can\u2019t do (to put off working on new music)? We think not.\n\nCheck out the trailer below to see inside the book.", "description": "The visual autobiography took five years to make and features unseen photographs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9b62f62209bb000a6fac03/lede/1570464709046-GettyImages-1175283552.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8439201451905626xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
