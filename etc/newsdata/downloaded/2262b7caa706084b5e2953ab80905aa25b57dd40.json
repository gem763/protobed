To go to the bathroom, take a shower, have a meal, I have to wait for hours,\u201d he told AFP during a phone interview.\n\nAs an unaccompanied minor, Ezzatolah should have a bed in a Moria section B caravan, where only children are accommodated under the supervision of specialised staff.\n\nBut in a camp filled to nearly five times its nominal capacity, there are only 160 safe places for more than 500 young people without families currently in Moria, according to UNICEF.\n\n\u201cMaking the journey on my own was very difficult. In Turkey I was beaten several times by the police, I did not always have money to buy food and now I have to face these difficult conditions and wait, always wait,\u201d the boy sighs.\n\nHe says that his attempts to see a doctor at the camp have been in vain so far.\n\nSome 8,300 children \u2014 1,600 of them unaccompanied \u2014 have been accommodated in overcrowded Aegean islands, the largest number since the beginning of 2016 from January to the end of September, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has called on European countries to share some of the burden.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be very difficult for European countries to divide this number and take some of the burden from Greece in managing this problem,\u201d Mitsotakis told AFP in an interview this week.\n\nIn May, the Council of Europe urged Athens to ensure that unaccompanied minors are not accommodated in camps or centres unsuitable for vulnerable people.\n\nBut five months later, out of 4,600 unaccompanied minors in Greece, only 26 percent live in safe conditions according to UNHCR.\n\nMost minors are held in camps, detention centres, or are homeless, according to the National Center for Social Solidarity, which oversees the management of these minors.\n\n\u2013 Exploitation by criminals \u2013\n\nThe main danger for these young people is to get caught in criminal networks of sexual exploitation, forced begging, pickpocketing or drug trafficking.\n\n\u201cNeglect and unsanitary conditions in the (camps) push some towards illegality,\u201d says Iraklis Moskoff, the Greek national rapporteur for the fight against human trafficking.\n\nWith the help of NGOs and camp staff, Moskoff is trying to identify the victims of these networks so that they can be protected.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s still very difficult to count them,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the camp of Skaramangas near Athens, 17-year-old Ahmed from Syria is losing hope.\n\nFor a year and a half, he has tried to reach Sweden where his father and his two brothers live.\n\nBut family reunification procedures are too long, he says.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a minor, you cannot work legally and it\u2019s very hard to survive. I know some who were tempted to make money in small-scale cannabis smuggling or by selling stolen goods,\u201d he said.\n\nSome children are more fortunate.\n\nTayebe, a 17-year-old Afghan girl, has been welcomed into a home for young girls and mothers, operated under the care of the NGO Home Project.\n\nThe NGO has so far welcomed 400 young people over the past three years in the 11 homes it operates for minors.\n\nIn her eight months in Greece, Tayebe has already received a scholarship to study at one of the best private high schools in Athens and dreams of becoming a psychologist.\n\nShe says she wants \u201cto help women to emancipate themselves and be free to make their own choices.\u201d\n\nThe organisation\u2019s homes supervisor Fotis Parthenides says the girls have fled war, poverty and forced marriages.\n\n\u201cOthers have been beaten, raped, they are often depressed when they arrive here, we try to give them a fresh start,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThese children have had to deal with so much violence that they cannot be left to their fate,\u201d says Sofia Kouvelaki, director of Home Project.\n\nAnd with hundreds of new arrivals in Greece per day, the situation is the worst it has been since 2016, she notes.", "description": "Athens (AFP) \u2013 At the notoriously overcrowded Greek island camp of Moria, Ezzatolah Soleimani admits he cries often amid despair, scenes of violence", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/5b6c42_year-ahmed-has-reach-sweden-his-father-his-two-brothers-live-in-greece-refugee-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
