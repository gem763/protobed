It is \u201clazy,\u201d she says (adding that she means the word \u201crespectfully\u201d) to bring up her husband\u2019s tweets. \u201cDo you talk about other people\u2019s spouses in your pieces, \u2018cause I\u2019ve been looking around, I haven\u2019t learned a single thing from any of your pieces.\u201d\n\nYilek offers to refer Kellyanne Conway to her editor, prompting the president\u2019s counselor to say, \u201cI\u2019ve known your editor since before you were born.\u201d Conway adds, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to give you a chance to explain why you think what you wrote qualifies as breaking news or reporting.\u201d\n\nThe reporter answers: \u201cI don\u2019t know that I have to explain that to you.\u201d\n\nRead: Kellyanne Conway, phantom czar\n\nThis is where the true power dynamic of the call comes into focus. It was Conway\u2019s office that called Yilek, after all. Apparently, a Conway aide had to call more than once to get through. The reporter gamely, and courteously, fields Conway\u2019s complaints. But ultimately, she does not have to do what Conway demands, nor is it entirely clear what Conway realistically wants. The story will not be unpublished. Eventually the reporter says to Conway, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve got to go. I\u2019ve got a meeting to run to.\u201d\n\nThe president has spent years now denigrating the media in ways large and small, from the ritualistic claim of \u201cfake news\u201d to his periodic branding of journalists as \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d This week, the White House even circulated a story that the president wanted government agencies to cancel any subscriptions they may have to The New York Times and The Washington Post.\n\nJournalists and publishers have warned the president that his accusations may incite violence, and that he has already inspired authoritarians abroad. These concerns are real. Yet Conway\u2019s phone call demonstrates that the fundamental order of this free society has yet to change. For all their power, a president or his advisers cannot force a citizen to say (or unsay) anything.\n\nThe media squander much of their power. They are often wrong or misled, and even more often starved for resources to report on a complicated world. In a general sense, Conway was not wrong to complain that many news stories are written \u201cjust for clicks.\u201d Yet much influence remains in journalists\u2019 hands.\n\nPossibly no one understands this better than the president, who built his brand by constantly working the media. As president, he has promoted friendly news outlets while trashing those he deems hostile. Yet most of the media still report independently. His denunciations of journalists, dangerous though they may be, often seem like howls of helpless rage. (Some other presidents have howled similarly, though usually in private.)", "description": "When a White House official tried to intimidate a reporter, she ended up illustrating the potency of a free press.", "authors": ["Steve Inskeep", "Co-Host Of Morning Edition On Npr"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2LJ1A/facebook.jpg?1572020993", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
