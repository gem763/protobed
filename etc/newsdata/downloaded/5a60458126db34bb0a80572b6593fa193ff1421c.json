This year, he said he'd only be seen in one if money was involved.\n\nHe thinks they often get sidetracked by \"nonsense.\"\n\nCuban said he prefers everything to be done over email, so he can always have a record.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nMark Cuban is known for a lot of things. He's the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, the star of \"Shark Tank,\" and loves the public light through appearances or his lively presence on Twitter. But did you know Cuban hates meetings?\n\nCuban, like everyone else, revealed in 2016 that he doesn't want to partake in meetings. He repeated that same stance earlier this year saying he'd only been seen in a boardroom or an outside meeting like lunch if there was money involved.\n\n\"I'm not big on 'Let's go eat lunch' meetings,\" Cuban said in a Q&A with Inc. \"The only way you're going to get me for a meeting is if you're writing me a check. Same with phone calls \u2014 they're a waste of time.\"\n\nThat sentiment hasn't changed.\n\nIn an interview with GQ, Cuban expanded on his vendetta against meetings because they simply don't always focus on what's at stake. Meetings, according to Cuban, often get sidetracked with \"nonsense.\"\n\n\"I hate meetings \u2014 nobody likes meeting expect the people who bring the donuts and the people who like to talk about their kids because when you sit in a meeting, you waste half the meeting,\" Cuban said.\n\n\"'So how was your weekend? How's your day? Why didn't they get the right kind of donuts? I'm tired of donuts \u2014 we should've got cupcakes.' All this nonsense that has nothing to do with getting the job done.\"", "description": "The billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks says he'll only go to meetings if 'you\u2019re writing me a check.'", "authors": ["Kyle Schnitzer"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5abe84cbea40962d008b46a0?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
