Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is pictured\n\nIt has been reported that the original whistleblower only had second or third-hand information about the phone call.\n\nTrump's supporters have also claimed the whistleblower may also harbor a political bias, following reports that they are a registered Democrat.\n\nEarlier this week, there were further accusations that they had interactions with the Democratic head of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, before they officially lodged their whistleblower complaint on August 12.\n\nAccording to Friday's report in The New York Times, the intelligence official who is now considering lodging a formal complaint has allegedly already been interviewed by Inspector General Michael Atkinson to verify statements made in the first complaint.\n\nThe news comes after a trio of House Democratic committees subpoenaed the White House for information about President Trump's July phone call with the president of Ukraine.\n\nDetractors of Trump have widely interpreted his July 25 call with the Ukrainian President as an attempt to 'dig up dirt' on political rival Joe Biden. Biden is pictured with his son Hunter in 2010\n\nA four-page letter issued by three committee chairmen Friday evening demanded the White House hand over the information by October 18. In the letter, they cite Trump's comment in a press conference this week that 'I always cooperate,' although Trump today when asked about cooperating said he would do whatever White House lawyers tell him to do.\n\nThey told the recipient, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney that failure to comply 'shall constitute evidence of obstruction.' The letter was signed first by House Oversight Committee Rep. Elijah Cummings, who clashed with Trump over the president's criticism of his home town of Baltimore.\n\n'We deeply regret that President Trump has put us\u2014and the nation\u2014in this position, but his actions have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena,' they wrote.\n\nThe move came hours after the same chairmen demanded documentation from Vice President Mike Pence about his calls and meetings with the Ukrainian government \u2013 as President Trump fended off an impeachment inquiry.\n\nPence features prominently in a whistle-blower's complaint. The person, identified as a CIA officer, cites the sudden cancellation of a planned trip by Pence to attend the inauguration of President Volodymyr Zelenksy in Kiev as part of an alleged pressure tactic to benefit the Trump-Pence reelection campaign.\n\nThe inquiry was announced by the chairs of the House Oversight, Foreign Affairs, and Intelligence committees, as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n'Recently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the President's stark message to the Ukrainian President,' the chairmen write in a joint letter.\n\nHouse Committees are demanding documents related to Vice President Mike Pence's interactions with Ukraine\n\n'The reports include specific references to a member of your staff who may have participated directly in the July 25, 2019, call, documents you may have obtained or reviewed, including the record of the call, and your September 1, 2019, meeting with the Ukrainian President in Warsaw, during which you reportedly discussed the Administration's hold on U.S. security assistance to Ukraine,' they continue.\n\n'The Committees are seeking the documents in the attached schedule in order to examine this sequence of events, including the Administration's attempts to press the Ukrainian President to open an investigation into former Vice President Biden or election interference in 2016, and the reasons behind the White House's decision to delay critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress to counter Russian aggression,' they write.\n\nThey are seeking to get all the documents by October 15, although Democrats have gone to court to try to pry administration documents in other matters.\n\nDemocrats are investigating the Trump administration's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is among three lawmakers who signed the letter\n\nThe letter to Pence comes as the Trump White House has been resisting document requests\n\nIt includes a request for information about Trump's July 25 phone call, which Pence reportedly was briefed on\n\nThe Trump White House has been resisting requests for documents, and is arguing House Democrats must first take a vote on an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThey seek information on Pence's September 1 meeting with Zelensky, and say there are 'questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the President's stark message to the Ukrainian President.'\n\nTrump on Thursday publicly asked Ukraine and China to investigate Biden. He also said on Twitter he had an 'absolute right' to ask a foreign country to investigate anyone.\n\nThe letter cites a Washington Post report that Trump used Pence to 'pressure' Ukraine, but states that it 'remains unclear' to what extent he had knowledge of 'specific aspects' of the plan. It also cites reports that Pence's national security advisor, Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, was on the call where Trump pushed for a 'favor' from the Ukrainian president \u2013 investigating Biden as well as his theory of 2016 election hacking.\n\nThe letter came hours after Trump predicted he would prevail in the Senate if the House votes to advance articles of impeachment.\n\nThe opposition would have to meet the exceedingly high bar of getting a two-thirds Senate vote to remove Trump from office. Were that to happen, Pence would be next in the line of succession.\n\nThe letter also cites Pence's quote backing up the president. 'I think the American people have a right to know if the Vice President of the United States or his family profited from his position as Vice President during the last administration. That's about looking backwards and understanding what really happened,' Pence said Thursday.", "description": "The newspaper's bombshell report was published Friday night, with the claims coming from two inside people who have been briefed on the matter.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/05/19323344-0-image-a-22_1570250364138.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
