Morey was forced to delete the tweet and apologize while the league issued a frantic statement bowing to Chinese Communist Party pressure. Commissioner Adam Silver then attempted to mitigate American outrage at the NBA silencing Morey by saying his freedom of expression \u201cis supported,\u201d but not quite detailing by who.\n\nThe outrage from American fans \u2013 who flooded NBA stadiums for pre-season games with pro-Hong Kong t-shirts and signed condemning Beijing\u2019s human rights abuses \u2013 reportedly triggered a decision among English-language Communist Party media to stop covering and condemning the NBA. The Global Times, which justified celebrating the September 11 terrorist attacks to spite Morey, went largely silent on the matter this weekend.\n\nBy Monday, the controversy had begun to die down when James attacked Morey in an interview for personally inconveniencing him, as James was traveling in China when Morey issued his tweet. James insisted that Morey should \u201ceducate\u201d himself on James\u2019 personal investments in China when exercising his right to free expression.\n\nHe attempted to end \u201cconfusion\u201d on Twitter following his remarks by stating that he was not criticizing the Hong Kong protest movement or discussing the \u201csubstance\u201d of China\u2019s human rights atrocities. James made clear he was demanding the world take into account how defending human rights could hurt LeBron James\u2019 financial interests and force him to confront difficult questions about doing business with an authoritarian regime.\n\nMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nChina\u2019s propaganda outlets have yet to comment on James\u2019 remarks, but independently endorsed Chinese citizens remaining fans of his and other NBA players despite Morey\u2019s remarks. In a column for China Daily, writer Zhang Zhouxiang condemned fanatical Chinese communists for harassing NBA fans and disparaging them as \u201ckneelers\u201d for bowing to the West by enjoying a sport.\n\n\u201cWhen the Wall Street Journal published a photo of two Chinese fans at one of the events on its cover, some domestic micro bloggers posted a photo of the page and called for people to find \u2018the two traitors,'\u201d China Daily noted. \u201cThis is too extreme. The two basketball fans have done nothing but watched a basketball game; How have they become \u2018traitors\u2019?\u201d\n\nThe column took a moment to call Morey\u2019s comments \u2013 in their entirety, they read, \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong\u201d \u2013 \u201cwrong\u201d and condemning Silver for saying that Morey \u201cis supported\u201d in his freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cChinese companies and institutions meanwhile are right to suspend cooperation with the NBA because of the above. Nonetheless, that does not negate the right of Chinese basketball fans to watch NBA matches and join NBA activities as long as the activities and contests are simply basketball matches,\u201d China Daily argued.\n\nPerhaps because it was written prior to James\u2019 comments Monday night, the column does not praise him personally, but instead comments Houston Rockets player James Harden for distancing himself from Morey and apologizing on his behalf.\n\n\u201cThe stars have done nothing wrong and they should not pay for the wrongs of their colleague or boss,\u201d the column concluded.\n\nNBA players\u2019 attempts to silence Morey resulted in the Chinese streaming service Tencent bringing back some games for streaming this week, which it had canceled in protest. The Houston Rockets remain offline to Chinese fans.\n\nThe Rockets are a particularly popular team in China because the nation\u2019s most successful basketball player, Yao Ming, played for them. Yao is now the head of the Chinese Basketball Association, which the Global Times tried half-heartedly to promote as as \u201cpatriotic\u201d alternative to the NBA last week.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s domestic basketball teams, the companies that supply their products and the media outlets that cover them have an opportunity to reform and transform themselves into something bigger and better, and fill the void left by the NBA,\u201d the Global Times claimed, citing \u201canalysts.\u201d\n\nThe NBA\u2019s scheduled exhibition games in Shanghai and Shenzhen, the city just north of Hong Kong, went on as planned, however, attracting fans who loved the league too much to bother with a boycott; the \u201ctraitors\u201d and \u201ckneelers.\u201d The South China Morning Post reported that the Brooklyn Nets, owned by pro-China mogul Joseph Tsai, and James\u2019 Los Angeles Lakers nearly filled Shenzhen\u2019s 18,000-seat Universiade Centre without a problem even after Morey\u2019s tweet. In Shanghai, a small number of people attempted to protest the NBA, but China\u2019s total ban on freedom of expression silenced them.\n\n\u201cIf the NBA became harmful to China\u2019s interests, we would reject it. But this wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal if you foreign media would shut up about it,\u201d a fan who wished to remain anonymous told Reuters, which noted that China rakes in over $4 billion for the NBA. The NBA notably runs a \u201ctraining center\u201d in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region, where China has built thousands of concentration camps to eliminate the Uyghur ethnic group. China also calls its concentration camps \u201ctraining centers,\u201d denying the human rights abuses survivors have witnessed and denounced there.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "China's English-language state media extended support to pro-China NBA \"stars\" after LeBron James criticized Hong Kong protesters.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/NBA-china-protest-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
