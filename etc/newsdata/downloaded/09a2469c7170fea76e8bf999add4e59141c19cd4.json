Are you and Mollie, your wife of four years, familiar with the swinging scene?\u201d \u2014 Middleditch describes telling her, in his own words, \u201cMollie, I\u2019m sorry, but we have to get nontraditional here.\u201d Damn, go off, polyamorous cowboy!\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t stop there. We learn that \u201cthe term \u2018swinging\u2019 is old,\u201d actually, and now it\u2019s \u201ccalled being \u2018part of the lifestyle,\u2019\u201d and also that being \u201cpart of the lifestyle\u201d has saved his marriage. We learn that Middleditch has \u201cbeen to some weird parties\u201d where, he explains, \u201cI\u2019ve seen some butts, I\u2019ve seen some tits,\u201d and that sometimes he is a \u201cravenous little monster.\u201d\n\nSure, there is something to reading a self-identified \u201cpretty vanilla, probably cis-hetero\u201d man talk openly about how he interacts with other men in this lawless swinger frontier. \u201cI\u2019ve totally gotten to the point where I can see a dick and just be like, \u2018Nice hog, buddy,\u2019\u201d he muses at one point, to which I say, earnestly, that\u2019s a lovely sentiment.\n\nWe can\u2019t know exactly what goes on beyond closed doors for Middleditch and Mollie beyond what he says in the interview (which is, to reiterate, a lot), but Middleditch comes off so wildly un-self-aware when discussing her. At one point, he says that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t get that\u201d fans want to sleep with him, and asks, \u201cWhere do I fit in?\u201d He also describes himself as the \u201cgas\u201d and her as the \u201cbrakes\u201d in their setup, and offhandedly notes that his wife is \u201cmore private\u201d about their lifestyle, which is something he has to \u201cjuggle,\u201d right before implying to the interviewer that they\u2019ve been to an Eyes Wide Shut\u2013style party.\n\nMiddleditch claims that he and Mollie are writing a comedy series about their swinging lifestyle, and I for one am extremely curious about Mollie\u2019s side of things. Hopefully, at least one episode is called \u201cMy Husband\u2019s Polyamorous Journey Including Our Trip to the Club With Godzilla Writers.\u201d", "description": "Thomas Middleditch, the Silicon Valley guy, spoke to Playboy about being ethically non-monogamous at astonishing length, and hinted that his wife isn\u2019t so on board.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/17/17-silicon-valley.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
