Similarly, widespread abuse clearly violates our App Store guidelines barring personal harm.\u201d\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment from AFP.\n\nThe makers of HKmap.live have countered that the app gathers information from users, social networks and news outlets to show where police have gathered, not where they aren\u2019t.\n\nThey have denied their app encouraged criminal activity, and lashed out at Apple\u2019s removal as \u201ccensorship\u201d and \u201cclearly a political decision to suppress freedom.\u201d\n\nChinese state media this week tore into the app, charging that it was helping \u201crioters.\u201d\n\nCommunist Party mouthpiece The People\u2019s Daily said by stocking the app, Apple was \u201cmixing business with politics, and even illegal acts.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday the app was no longer available on Apple\u2019s Hong Kong App Store.\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by four months of increasingly violent protests, initially against a now-shelved extradition law, but whose focus has now shifted to broader pro-democracy aims.", "description": "San Francisco (AFP) \u2013 Apple chief Tim Cook on Thursday defended the decision to pull an app used by protesters in Hong Kong to track police,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/9683a4_apple-removed-hkmap-live-mobile-application-app-store-criticism-by-beijing-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
