It was not something that was open to people of my background,\" he added.\n\nMercurio said that when he was coming up with \"Line of Duty\", about a police anti-corruption unit, the British police force he approached said they \"did not want to get involved with anything that showed police officers making mistakes.\"\n\nHe said top brass are obsessed with PR and in denial of problems within their forces.\n\n\"A lot of very senior police officers go on public platforms and say, 'We don't do the kind of things that are depicted in the show.'\n\n\"But we can produce news stories that show that not only did police do that, but they actually did it themselves,\" he added.", "description": "Television medical dramas do not show how cynical and jaded doctors are in real life, doctor-turned-scriptwriting star Jed Mercurio said Wednesday.
