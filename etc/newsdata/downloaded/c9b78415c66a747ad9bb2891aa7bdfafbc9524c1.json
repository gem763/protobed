Rates at the hotel start at $343 per night. The Beverly Hills location is just one of four SLS branded hotels; the others are in the greater Miami area and in the Bahamas. This location opened in 2008 and just underwent a $22 million renovation that focused on updating its 297 guest rooms.\n\nThe SLS Beverly Hill's success is rooted in what Thomas says is the future of hospitality: \"Being connected to the local area\" while remembering that \"we are citizens of the world.\"\n\nRead more: The 17 best hotels in the world, according to travelers\n\nChristophe Thomas started as the general manager of the SLS Beverly Hills in 2016. Courtesy of SLS Beverly Hills\n\nSo, how exactly does the SLS Beverly Hills deliver on this duality?\n\nFor one thing, Thomas told Business Insider, a red carpet lines the walk into the SLS lobby.\n\n\"The red carpet is perfect for the Los Angeles market,\" Thomas said. \"[In] Los Angeles, everybody hopes to be, or maybe is, a celebrity and it puts you, right away, into the mood and spirit of the LA market.\"\n\nAnd the hotel's restaurants use local produce. The hotel's main restaurant, The Bazaar, is helmed by Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, serves Spanish cuisine, and has a Michelin Plate and the hotel's newest restaurant, Somni, has two Michelin stars.\n\nBut on the global end of things, Thomas, along with the restaurant and bar team, just started an exclusive, two-hour cocktail-tasting experience. The experience, called Bazaar Flights at Gate: Bar Centro, features bartenders creating 12 local takes on cocktails from around the world in an intimate 10-person setting. The by-reservation-only experience costs $100 per person.\n\nUltimately, hotels need to carve out a place with a unique identity to draw in guests. As citizens of the world, Thomas says, \"it's responsible behavior to be local,\" and he predicts that's the mindset that will carry the hospitality industry forward.", "description": "The manager of the SLS Beverly Hills says the ability to feel both local and global is what will carry the hospitality industry forward.", "authors": ["Taylor Borden"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da8db46cc4a0a73be1955e6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
