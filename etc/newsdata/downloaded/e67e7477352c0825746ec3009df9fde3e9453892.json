The two-year Treasury yield is more than 25 basis points up from its low in September, immediately after President Donald Trump\u2019s last big escalation of the trade dispute. The yield rose three basis points to 1.65% on Monday, while the and yields rose by five basis points each.\n\nHigher yields on other havens put downward pressure on non-interest-bearing bullion, and by 11:30 AM ET (1530 GMT), for delivery on the Comex exchange were down or 0.8% to $1,493.75 a troy ounce. fell 0.9% to $1,491.82 an ounce.\n\nalso retreated, losing 0.3% to $17.87 an ounce, while fell 1.0% to $924.30.\n\nWith most people in the market still betting on a rate cut, some have warned that there could be some sharp volatility if the Fed disappoints on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cLet's be very clear here, we would not be at new highs in or we would not have hit these current levels of 3,000 in the S&P were it not for complete central bank capitulation,\u201d said Northman Trader\u2019s chief market strategist Sven Henrich. \u201cFour rate cuts, jawboning trade optimism, all these valuations have to be justified at the end of the day. You cannot lose one of these equations and so markets remain artificially inflated.\u201d", "description": "Gold Falls as Bond Yields Hit Highs on Receding Tail Risks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF410GC_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
