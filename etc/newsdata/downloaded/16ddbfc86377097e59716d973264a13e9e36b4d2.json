We get it, they are partisan hacks who work as the PR division of the Democrat Party. It has been proven out, many times over.\n\nYet even with that in mind, it can still be surprising to see them act out in such a biased fashion as to even work against their own self-interest. The latest comes from Jill Filipovic over at CNN. Today she was bemoaning the fact that Katie Hill resigned her position as a result of her revealed sex scandal with her staffers.\n\nThe story was broken at our partner site RedState, with some great reporting work done by Jennifer Van Laar. Her article has become a national story, and yet the national media complex is upset \u2014 at Jennifer and at RedState. Today on CNN Jill Filipovic came out swinging, suggesting that the site be investigated by the government for promoting revenge porn.\n\n\"Speaker Pelosi said it best: her actions made it untenable for her to continue serving,\" says @alicetweet on Rep. Katie Hill's resignation. \"She's resigned,\" adds @JillFilipovic. \"Now let's talk about what happened to her, what she was a victim of.\"https://t.co/28hUIsootv pic.twitter.com/P0tU7wG846 \u2014 CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) October 28, 2019\n\nThese are the same people who have been lecturing extensively about protecting women in the workplace and stamping out sexual predation by superiors. That means the victim here would be the young staffer who was in the relationship, and Hill was the predator. But Jill and CNN want to reframe this story about a mean news outlet victimizing an adored politician.\n\nPublications have a responsibility to not publish revenge porn under the veil of anonymity. It's shameful that @RedState published the Hill photos, and even more shameful that they are covering up their provenance. Don't give anonymity to people leaking nude pics for revenge. \u2014 Jill Filipovic (@JillFilipovic) October 28, 2019\n\nLook at the reframing of the pictures VanLaar included in her piece as being \u201crevenge porn\u201d. Two pics showed Hill and the staffer posing in winter clothes and smiling, and another where they turn and share a deep kiss, and a third of Hill naked (not exposed) while combing the hair of the seated staffer. The photos were used to show the relationship that Hill denied having with a member of her staff.\n\nThere have been far more salacious pictures of Hill shown in other news outlets, and some of these were gleaned from a social dating portal. Katie Hill had posed for, and submitted those photos, to a wife-sharing website for swingers. While this in itself is not exactly scandalous, suggesting a news outlet using far less salacious images for the sake of buttressing a story is resorting to \u201crevenge porn\u201d shows the desperation on the part of these news outlets.\n\nYou aren't playing with a full deck. The photos were readily available on the web. \u2014 KEE (@superbucks2050) October 28, 2019\n\nIs it really \"revenge porn\" if she posted it to a wife sharing site? \u2014 Yooper (@yooper1911) October 28, 2019\n\nShe and her husband posted them to wife sharing sites.. the Daily Mail article was clear on that. Not revenge porn. \u2014 But I Sawed It! (@PunchMyJunk) October 28, 2019\n\nNote too Filipovic getting very indignant that VanLaar and RedState did not reveal the source of the photos. This is an incredibly dense stance for a supposed journalist to take. Protecting witnesses and sources has long been a stance of the press, yet here we have one member suggesting that RedState turn over who it was that sourced VanLaar\u2019s story.\n\nOf course what Filipovic will never address \u2014 Katie Hill has admitted the story was accurate, and the Democrats have assured this to be the case by not supporting her. But here we have this nation\u2019s messengers calling to instead shoot the messenger.\n\nQuestion: is she right or wrong for having a relationship with her staff/intern or whatever she is? I think that\u2019s a violation of the ethics. So she\u2019s wrong and good that she\u2019s stepping down. Disgrace \u2014 CarolB66 (@carolrhea) October 28, 2019\n\nYou are just pissed because the leftwing press could have just buried the story if not for the pictures. They were in the process of doing just that before Red State and The Daily Mail made it impossible for them to ignore. \u2014 HELMS-DEEP.US (@ThatchHD) October 28, 2019\n\nJill wrote a piece about this RedState report.\n\nWas on @cnn today with the brilliant \u2066@JillFilipovic\u2069 talking about Katie Hill and revenge porn. Her piece here nails it: https://t.co/eRqLrwU7j2 pic.twitter.com/n5YnQQ9rgQ \u2014 Aisha C Moodie-Mills (@AishaMoodMills) October 28, 2019\n\nIn it she only gives passing mention that the Hill affair was improper, but declares the reporting on it was WAY more improper. So it was wrong of her to have the sexual relationship with a young staffer, but if anyone reports on the sexual affair it is a \u201csexualized attack\u201d, according to Filipovic.\n\nIn other words, the attacker is the real victim in all of this.\n\nJournalists upset at journalism, running defense for a politician who admitted guilt, and demanding that another journalist expose confidential sources to the public \u2014 all because a member of their preferred party was exposed.\n\nIt would be funny when this standard comes back and bites them, if it were not such a sad statement on the state of their industry.", "description": "The journalists defending Katie Hill as a victim should be embarrassed, but they are incapable of such emotions.", "authors": ["Brad S.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jill.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
