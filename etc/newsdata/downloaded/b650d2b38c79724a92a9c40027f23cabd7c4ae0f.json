[\u2026] He missed two roll call votes Thursday, the first day back following a two-week recess. He previously released a statement saying he\u2019d be back by the time the session resumed. The 68-year-old hasn\u2019t taken part in a roll call vote since Sept. 11. The unidentified procedure caused Cummings to miss a September hearing on Washington, D.C., statehood. His statement didn\u2019t detail the procedure. He previously was treated for heart and knee issues.
