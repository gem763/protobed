The Jets, coming off a 6-4 season-opening loss to the New York Rangers on Thursday, scored three times in the third period to force overtime and ultimately the shootout.\n\nDevils forward Jack Hughes, the 18-year-old No. 1 overall draft pick of 2019, played 15:12 and missed a shootout attempt in his NHL debut. New Jersey\u2019s Nikita Gusev and Winnipeg\u2019s Kyle Connor scored in the first round of the shootout, and neither team converted again until Wheeler\u2019s winner.\n\nFlyers 4, Blackhawks 3\n\nTravis Konecny scored twice and Carter Hart made 28 saves as Philadelphia skated past Chicago in Prague, Czech Republic.\n\nOskar Lindblom had a power-play goal and Michael Raffl also tallied for the Flyers, who presented new coach Alain Vigneault with a victory in their season opener.\n\nPatrick Kane had a goal and two assists, Alexander Nylander and Alex DeBrincat also tallied, and Corey Crawford turned aside 34 shots for the Blackhawks.\n\nMaple Leafs 4, Blue Jackets 1\n\nMitch Marner had two goals and an assist, Morgan Rielly added three assists, and visiting Toronto defeated Columbus.\n\nCody Ceci and Auston Matthews also scored for the Maple Leafs, who have won their first two games of the season. John Tavares added two assists.\n\nCam Atkinson scored for the Blue Jackets in their season opener, tying the NHL record by scoring in a sixth straight opening-day game.
