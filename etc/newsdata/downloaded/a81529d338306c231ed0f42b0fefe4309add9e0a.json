Among other things, Taylor testified that President Donald Trump tried to coerce the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals by withholding military aid.\n\nDuffy, who was one of the president\u2019s most loyal defenders in Congress before retiring this summer, claimed that there was no quid pro quo as it related to the aid because the Ukrainians apparently weren\u2019t aware that Trump was withholding it at the time. Duffy, meanwhile, pivoted to former Vice President Joe Biden, accusing the ex-veep of engaging in a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden, who said if you don\u2019t\u2014if you don\u2019t fire this prosecutor, I\u2019m going to take away a billion dollars,\u201d the former Wisconsin lawmaker declared. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing for another thing. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have that because the Ukrainians never knew anything was taken away.\u201d\n\n(The New York Times reported on Wednesday morning, however, that Ukraine knew about the aid freeze before it became public in late August, contradicting the Trump administration's claims.)\n\nDent fired back, however, noting that Taylor\u2019s testimony revealed that the Ukrainian president was being told he needed to declare on CNN he was opening investigations, adding that the Ukrainians \u201cclearly understood the pressure they were under.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey needed the weapons,\u201d Dent added. \u201cAnd they were being told to make a public statement on CNN to investigate Burisma and the Bidens. That\u2019s clear.\u201d\n\nDuffy, a former MTV reality-TV star, attempted to object to Dent\u2019s assessment, prompting the so-called \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican to dunk on his colleague.\n\n\u201cPeople ask me \u2018Why do I push back against this administration and the president?\u2019\u201d Dent exclaimed. \u201cBecause my nose is not a heat-seeking missile for the president\u2019s backside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is wrong,\u201d he concluded. \u201cYou cannot use official resources of the government to investigate your political opponent.\"\n\nIt has been something of an incongruous start to Duffy\u2019s tenure at CNN. Since joining the network as a political commentator on Sunday, Duffy has already used multiple CNN appearances to spread a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 election, prompting criticism from network hosts and contributors.", "description": "The two former Republican congressmen went at it Wednesday morning on CNN.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571845021/new-day-alisyn-camerota-and-john-berman_7_evmc91", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
