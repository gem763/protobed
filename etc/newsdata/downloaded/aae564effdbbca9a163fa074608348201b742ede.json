There are definitely multiple cases and perpetrators in mind, but there\u2019s not one in particular despite what everyone seems to think,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile it appears Aela did not extend her protest to social media, the student has apparently provided some news outlets, including People magazine and BuzzFeed, with a selfie she snapped showing the sticky note on a bathroom mirror.\n\n\u201cIn this day and age of social media and all other vehicles, she went old school. I am very proud of her,\u201d Aela\u2019s mother Shael Norris said, Aela\u2019s mother Shael Norris said, reported People magazine.\u201d target=\u201d_blank\u201d>according to People magazine.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
