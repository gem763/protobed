While those countries are logical answers, they\u2019d be wrong. Venezuela presides over the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, oil fields containing up to 500 billion barrels. At a reasonable estimate of $50 a barrel, Venezuelan oil represents a $25 trillion global energy resource.\n\nDespite such valuable oil resources, far beyond any other another nation, Venezuela has fallen onto hard times. It\u2019s now a country rife with political corruption, rampant crime. and is subjected to outside political pressures and influence from China, Russia and other countries. Venezuela\u2019s socialist leader, Nicolas Maduro, has allowed this South American nation to fall into complete chaos, and control of Venezuela\u2019s vast oil reserves is essentially up for grabs.\n\nAdd to this mix the fact that Russia, China, Cuba and other nations all want access to \u2014 or outright control of \u2014 Venezuela\u2019s oil, and you have a disturbing international issue that is only growing more problematic. Russia and China have also been sending billions into Venezuela to help the thuggish Maduro maintain control of his country and to gain access to the oil.\n\nRussian warships have just recently been granted permission to dock in Venezuelan ports. Lawless Cuban gangs operate freely in the country, acting as enforcers for the brutal Maduro regime, and rampant narcotrafficking and corruption help prop it up.\n\nPresident Trump has taken correct action by slapping Mr. Maduro and his corrupt government with very tough economic sanctions. The goal is to force Mr. Maduro out of power. But with China and Russia financing Maduro\u2019s government and his military, moving the cruel dictator out of office hasn\u2019t been easy.\n\nThe president is on the right track by working for Mr. Maduro\u2019s ouster via tough sanctions. But the American energy alliance with Venezuela \u2014 which has lasted nearly 100 years \u2014 must also be preserved for the good of U.S. national security and for the hope and future of Venezuela. If the United States is forced to exit Venezuela, China and Russia are poised to move in and take control of the world\u2019s largest oil reserves.\n\nThe president is correctly playing tough with China regarding international trade policies with the United States. It therefore makes little sense to walk away from Venezuela, forfeit billions invested in energy-producing equipment, and give China a huge economic windfall and strategic access to billions of barrels of oil. Doing so would undermine the president\u2019s own efforts to establish fair trade with China. If the American energy industry exits Venezuela, China will immediately have more money and power to fight the president\u2019s trade policies.\n\nForcing American interests completely out of Venezuela would also be seen as an international foreign-policy setback and an unwelcome embarrassment for the president. If the United States exits Venezuela, China and Russia will actively work to prop up and protect Mr. Maduro\u2019s government, making it even more difficult for the administration to oust Mr. Maduro and help Venezuela recover.\n\nMuch of Venezuela\u2019s law-abiding middle class has been driven from the country. Violent drug cartels and paramilitary groups now control huge swaths of the nation. Hospitals lack much-needed medical supplies, the country has no reliable water or sewage service, and the nation\u2019s currency is nearly worthless due to years of massive inflation and government mismanagement. What is happening in Venezuela is nearly identical to the formation of Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba decades ago.\n\nMost international observers agree that Mr. Maduro\u2019s brutal socialist regime must end. Pro-democratic forces have been working in Venezuela for some time with the goal of ousting Mr. Maduro. Once Mr. Maduro resigns, the United States must be in position from Day 1 to assist and work with a new government. Our long-established presence in-country would be of major benefit to the people of Venezuela as the United States is likely the only nation truly able to halt the widespread human-rights abuses occurring there and assist a new government in restoring order.\n\nA realistic chance for Venezuela\u2019s economic and social recovery looks bleak without the ongoing help of the United States\u2019 energy industry and supporting companies. It\u2019s an alliance worth preserving for the sake of a much troubled Venezuela and as a way of protecting America\u2019s energy supply and our national security.\n\n\u2022 Sean Spicer has served as White House press secretary and chief strategist of the Republican National Committee, and is a senior adviser to America First Action.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
