Defendants, victims and witnesses have failed to show up at court because they are afraid of being arrested and deported, officials say.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cValid prosecutions have been abandoned, or in some cases they\u2019ve never been pursued. ICE\u2019s enforcement actions undermine the effectiveness of the court system,\u201d James said during a press conference outside the courthouse. \u201cWitnesses to violent crimes on the streets of New York City have decided not to enter into our courts. Victims of intimate partner violence, victims of domestic violence have decided not to cooperate or testify against their attackers.\u201d\n\nAlmost 400 immigrants have been arrested in and around courthouses in New York state since President Donald Trump took office in 2017 \u2014 a jump of 1,700 percent, according to James' office.\n\nThe suit asks for an injunction throwing out a 2018 directive from ICE that authorizes courthouse arrests.\n\nThe state court system earlier this year barred immigration agents from making arrests inside courthouses without a warrant from a judge, but arrests outside courthouses have continued.\n\n\u201cICE\u2019s enforcement activities at courthouses are consistent with longstanding law enforcement practices nationwide. And, courthouse arrests are often necessitated by the unwillingness of jurisdictions to cooperate with ICE in the transfer of custody of aliens from their prisons and jails,\u201d said ICE spokesperson Rachael Yong Yow.\n\nThe agency treats schools, hospitals and houses of worship as sensitive locations where they don\u2019t make arrests in most circumstances, but does not apply that rule to courts.\n\nIn one case cited in the suit, ICE arrested a pregnant mother in Queens after she went to a custody hearing for her children, who are U.S. citizens. In another case, an ICE agent trying to block a man from entering Yonkers City Court accidentally broke the glass courthouse door with his foot.\n\nDeportations have also helped criminals avoid serving time in New York, officials argue. A Uruguayan citizen charged with sexual and domestic violence was set to plead guilty and get three years in prison \u2014 but was instead arrested before the court hearing and deported without doing time, according to the complaint.\n\nThe lawsuit charges that ICE\u2019s policy infringes on state sovereignty over the court system, and violates a common law principle treating courthouses as protected locations.\n\nThe Legal Aid Society brought a separate suit challenging the policy on behalf of a man who wanted to appear in court to get an order of protection against an abusive partner, but never got the order because he was too afraid of deportation to show up.\n\nGonzalez said he has been forced to reduce or drop charges in several cases because immigrant witnesses were too afraid to testify.\n\n\u201cFor many of my constituents the courthouse is no longer a place of safety and justice,\" he said. \"It's a trap.\"", "description": "The lawsuit charges that ICE\u2019s policy infringes on state sovereignty over the court system.", "authors": ["Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/da/d0/6222f299481bbc80c3ae04f9ffe7/ap-james-900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
