It is led by institutions and funds, not private investors. Global quantitative easing created a huge and mobile pool of capital in constant need of a place to call home. As the need for a safe haven became apparent among the stewards of that capital, the demand for flourished. The consistent presence of funds and institutions as buyers in this rally, as represented by the growth in ETF stockpiles, is one of its hallmarks and represents one of the major differences between this gold rally and rallies of the past. Though private investors have been late to the game, the rapid development of the physical market for gold coins and bullion in the United Kingdom is a testament to the fact that sentiment can change quickly.\n\n2. Day-to-day price reversals often originate in Asia and Europe, not just the United States. For decades, the U.S. commodity markets set the tone for pricing and the rest of the world was content to follow. Even the old London price fix tended to follow along with trends established in the United States. That all changed when the Shanghai gold market began offering its own pricing mechanism and the effects of Brexit began to have a profound impact on both sides of the English Channel. Now, price reversals often begin in Asian or European markets overnight and carry over to the open in New York rather than the other way around. All of this is a reflection of ramped up global investor interest in gold and a leveling of the playing field in terms of who and what influences the price on a daily basis. As such, it comprises our second important difference between the current gold price rally and rallies in the past.\n\n3. Central banks are buyers of physical , not sellers. In 2011 something unusual happened in the gold market. Central banks flipped from being net sellers of the precious metal to net buyers reversing a 40-year trend. Since then, the official sector has added 4,563 metric tonnes to their coffers (through the first half of 2019) \u2013 a 15% gain in stockpiles to 34,407 metric tonnes. The gold that central banks take off the market, though, is only part of the story. The rest has to do with how domestic production in two key producing countries \u2013 China and Russia (the world\u2019s number one and three producers) \u2013 is treated. Both countries channel their mined metal into national reserves rather than selling it in the global marketplace. Many analysts see this new and evolving approach to gold reserves as the key difference between the present gold rally and rallies of the past.\n\n4. Bullion banks are covering their shorts on price retreats, not piling-on. Declining global interest rates have put a damper on another traditional source of physical supply \u2013 bullion bank leasing programs. \u201cWe can conclude,\u201d writes gold market analyst, Alasdair Macleod, in an insightful paper published at the GoldMoney website, \u201cthat the basis for highly geared interest rate arbitrage by borrowing gold is running into a brick wall. Not only is there no incentive for lessors but also there is also a diminishing appetite for lessees because the opportunities are vanishing. Synthetic gold liabilities are being gradually reduced, not only by ceasing the creation of new obligations but by buying bullion to cover existing ones. This will have been particularly the case when the USD yield curve began to invert in recent months (itself a backwardation of time preference), and was the surface reason, therefore, that the gold price moved rapidly from under $1200 to over $1500.\u201d This change in direction for bullion banks represents another fundamental difference between this rally in the gold price and rallies of the past. What\u2019s more, given the entrenched low-rate environment, it looks like it might remain a factor for some time to come.\n\n5. Yields in economically important parts of the world are negative, not positive. Negative interest rates are a reality in both the European Union and Japan, and Alan Greenspan said recently that it is \u201conly a matter of time\u201d before they spread to the United States. One of the arguments against over the years has been that it costs money to own it. Now it costs money to own euros and yen, and before too long it might cost money to own the dollar as well. The advent of negative rates is perhaps one of the more profound differences between this gold rally and rallies of the past. It might also prove to be the most enduring. \u201cOne of the reasons,\u201d Greenspan added in that same CNBC interview, \u201cthe gold price is rising as fast as it is \u2013 you know, at $1500 a troy ounce . . . What that is telling us is that people are looking for resources they know are going to have a value 20 years from now, or 30 years from now, as they age and they want to make sure they have the resources to keep themselves in place.\u201d\n\nAn alternative to the dollar\n\nIn a recent GoldHub interview, the former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Duvvuri Subbarao, made some interesting observations with respect to emerging countries\u2019 attitude towards ownership as a national reserve asset. \u201c\u2018In the immediate aftermath of the crisis,\u201d he says, \u201cwe had to sell dollars to prevent our currency going into freefall. During Quantitative Easing, we had to buy dollars to protect our financial stability. And when the Federal Reserve began to taper QE, exchange rates slumped again and we had to defend ourselves with our reserves. All these events prompted one obvious question \u2013 Is there an alternative to the dollar?\u201d Subbarao, goes on to explain that if central banks cannot rely on the dollar for stability then they need to find it elsewhere. \u201cHolding gold within our reserves,\u201d he adds, \u201cis an integral part of that self-defence.\u201d As it is, we might add, for private individuals as well.\n\nHouseholds in India pile up 24,000 tonnes of\n\nIndia\u2019s Financial Express tells us that \u201cHouseholds in India may have piled up around 24,000-25,000 tonnes of , remaining the world\u2019s largest holders of the precious metal,\u201d according to the World Gold Council. . .At current prices, the value of that private stockpile amounts to over $1.1 trillion \u2013 \u201cor equivalent of more than 40% of India\u2019s nominal gross domestic product\u201d for the year. To give you an idea just how much gold the people of India own in the overall scheme of things, the total amount of gold held by governments and central banks globally is 33,976 tonnes, according to World Gold Council statistics.\n\nRussia\u2019s huge stash is worth more than $100 billion\n\n\u201cThe country [Russia] quadrupled reserves in the past decade as it diversified away from U.S. assets,\u201d reports Bloomberg, \u201ca move that has paid off recently as haven demand sent gold prices to a six-year high. In the past year, the value of the nation\u2019s gold jumped 42% to $109.5 billion and the metal now makes up the biggest share of Russia\u2019s total reserves since 2000.\u201d Russia\u2019s reserve gains via appreciation of the precious metal will not be lost on a whole host of other countries looking to move in the same direction.\n\nas a central bank reserve asset\n\nIn a recap on the year with respect to central bank buying, the World Gold Council reports: \u201cIn 2018, central banks bought more than at any time under the existing international monetary system. The vast majority of demand has come from emerging and developing country central banks. 19 individual central banks bought more than one tonne of gold in 2018, giving rise to total purchases of 651 tonnes. Even the European Union re-emerged as a net buyer, due to substantial purchases from Poland and Hungary.\u201d\n\nMarket cycles will endure as long as humans exist\n\n\u201cFour of the most dangerous words in the investment world are \u2018It\u2019s different this time,\u2019 writes Howard Marks in a Bloomberg opinion piece. \u201cWhen people use them, what they\u2019re saying is that the norms of the past no longer apply. . .Both these notions were soon shown to have been erroneous, and the market bubbles abetted by that optimistic thinking were popped, bringing on painful market crashes.\u201d\n\nDr. MoneyWise says: \u201cOld Ben Franklin said it best. \u2018By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.\u2019 And I will add, we do not know when the next crisis will begin, but begin it will. And when it does, only two kinds of investors will be there to greet it: Those who prepared and those who did not.\u201d\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Dollar\n\nPurchasing Power of the U.S. Dollar (1913-2019)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret,\u201d says HowMuch, \u201cthat $1 now will get you less than it would 100 years ago, but just how much has the purchasing power of the U.S. Dollar decreased over the years? To illustrate this, we created a visualization that demonstrates the rise and fall of the dollar since 1913. Using this graphic, we can see how inflation and changes in the Consumer Price Index have decreased the dollar\u2019s purchasing power over the last century.\n\n\u2022 $100 in 1913 would only be worth about $3.87 today.\n\n\u2022 While the purchasing power of the dollar has gone up and down since 1913, it has never surpassed the purchasing power it had in 1913.\n\n\u2022 The purchasing power of U.S. citizens has always topped the charts, but that could be changing in the future.\n\n\u2022 Inflation impacts nearly all variables of macroeconomics, and many believe that current U.S. inflation levels are too low.\u201d\n\nEconomic insecurity is becoming the new hallmark of old age\n\n\u201cIn the United States,\u201d writes Katherine S. Newman and Rebecca Hayes Jacobs for The Nation, \u201ceconomic security in old age was seen, for a long time, as both a social issue and a national obligation. From the birth of Social Security to the end of the 20th century, the common assumption has been that we have a shared responsibility to secure a decent retirement for our citizens. Yet that notion is weakening rapidly. Instead, we have started to hear echoes of the mantra of self-reliance that characterized welfare \u2018reform\u2019 in the 1990s: You alone are in charge of your retirement; if you wind up in poverty in your old age, you have only your own inability to plan, save, and invest to blame.\u201d\n\nStock Chart\n\nSome compare today\u2019s stock market psychology to the period just before 2008. Others compare it to the 1920s when everything was hunky-dory until suddenly it wasn\u2019t \u2013 perhaps a more apt comparison. Too many are \u201call-in\u201d with respect to stocks in their Individual Retirement Accounts hoping to accumulate as much capital as possible without regard to the potential downside. The stock market did not recover from the losses accumulated between 1929 and 1933 until the mid-1950s, almost 25-years later \u2013 a fragment of stock market history lost to time.\n\nSome will rely on the fact that stocks recovered nicely once the Fed launched the 2009 bailout. We should keep in mind though that many prominent Wall Street analysts have warned that the Fed no longer has the firepower it did then. The financial markets and economy are much more vulnerable as a result \u2013 all of which brings us back to the notions of self-reliance and taking personal responsibility for our retirement plans. If you find yourself among the group that thinks to hedge a stock market downturn to be in your best interest, we can help you effectively structure a and silver diversification as part of your retirement plan to hedge that possibility. \u2013 Michael J.
