REUTERS/Fang Nanlin\n\nIt takes just 1,500 yuan ($212.28) at a pet caf\u00e9 in southwest China that dyes pups in black and white streaks to resemble the animal that is considered a national treasure.\n\nThe cafe, which opened last month in the city of Chengdu in Sichuan province, has gone viral on social media after owner Lu Yunning dyed his six chow-chow puppies to look like pandas.\n\n\u201cThere are many dog cafes, cat cafes, raccoon cafes, alpaca cafes and duck cafes,\u201d said Lu, as the puppies, their limbs, ears and fur around the eyes dyed black, playfully chased a fish toy on a cord.\n\n\u201cWe think they are not creative. We wanted something novel,\u201d added the 21-year-old, who estimates his cafe draws 70 to 80 customers a day, nearly doubling since he posted social media pictures of his dyed dogs.\n\nBut until now customers have been more interested in taking pictures with Lu\u2019s dogs than signing up for the dye service.\n\nLu said the imported dye he used did not harm the dogs, and was spread only on the upper part of their fur, rather than extending down to the base.\n\nTo round out the vacation experience, the Candy Planet Pet Cafe also offers washing and hotel services.\n\nThe attention drawn by the chow-chows has not all been positive, however, with animal rights group PETA urging people to keep away.\n\n\u201cCoating dogs with chemical dyes is stressful and can even cause allergic reactions on their skin, nose, and eyes,\u201d Jason Baker, its Asia vice president, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cPETA urges travelers to stay away from any business that exploits animals for a money-grabbing gimmick,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nSome online commentators have accused Lu of animal abuse.\n\n\u201cIn a dog\u2019s world, there is only you,\u201d a user with the handle Biewenwochouliumang wrote on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo. \u201cPlease be kind to them.\u201d\n\n(This story corrects reporting tagline)", "description": "Would you like your dog transformed into a panda?", "authors": ["Fang Nanlin", "Martin Pollard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446403700&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T06Q", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
