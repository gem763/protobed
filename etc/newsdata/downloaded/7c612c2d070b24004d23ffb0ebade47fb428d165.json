REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo\n\nDiamond miners, which have long excelled at marketing, are seeking new approaches to battle falling demand and competition from diamonds manufactured in laboratories.\n\n\u201cWe are completing talks with several major companies in different regions,\u201d Alrosa Chief Executive Sergei Ivanov told Reuters.\n\nAlrosa, which now sells these diamonds mixed with others in \u201clots\u201d, expects the retailers to start offering its fluorescent stones in a year under the brand \u201cLuminous Diamonds\u201d, which it has recently created, in separate corners of their stores.\n\nThe aim is to create a new market for stones with fluorescence, often a blueish glow visible under light, that are still considered by many traders as being of lower quality.\n\nGlobal demand for all types of diamonds has been hit by a trade war between the United States and China, the world\u2019s two biggest diamond markets. Prices for smaller stones have fallen as deliberate output reductions have yet to remove oversupply. Alrosa and its competitors, chiefly Anglo American\u2019s (AAL.L) De Beers, are betting on a \u201cvalue over volume\u201d strategy. Alrosa expects to produce 38.5 million carats in 2019 but will sell only 32 million to 33 million carats, stockpiling the rest until better days.\n\nAlrosa does not disclose the names of the retailers it is talking to but says it has no plans to start its own retail business. Product sales will be organized by retailers via their own distribution chains.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to supply fluorescent polished diamonds - cut by Alrosa or its clients - to retailers and provide marketing support, including jewelery design if needed,\u201d Ivanov said.\n\nFLUORESCENT ADOLESCENT\n\nFluorescence, a bluish glow produced by ultraviolet rays from a lamp or the sun, is a characteristic of 25% to 35% of diamonds, according to the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). It is not bad for the precious stone, according to GIA, and it is not a grading factor like the traditional 4Cs \u2014 color, clarity, cut and carat weight \u2014 used to determine quality.\n\nAbout half of all diamonds produced globally have some fluorescence, while 3% to 10% have strong fluorescence, Ivanov said.\n\nBut such diamonds are more difficult to sell as many traders now consider stones with more fluorescence as lower quality, so they often trade at a 25% to 45% discount, even though they could demand a premium several decades ago, he said.\n\nWith global annual rough diamond sales of $15 billion and diamond jewelery demand at $85 billion, any new marketing niche is attractive for the entire supply chain.\n\nDiamond industry players have long been betting on \u201cmillennial\u201d, born between the early 1980s and early 2000s, and \u201cgeneration Z\u201d, born from the mid-1990s to early 2000s, as drivers of growth in jewelery demand as their spending power rises.\n\nAlrosa aims to woo this generation with florescent stones.\n\nRecent research conducted by a consulting company for Alrosa in the United States and China showed millennial liked the stones for their unusual quality in jewelery, Ivanov said.\n\n\u201cWe saw that it can become a fashionable product and interesting for these young people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe same research also showed positive results among women, so the \u201cLuminous Diamonds\u201d brand sought to appeal to women\u2019s independence and purchasing power, which was rising in the United States, China and India, the CEO added.\n\n\u201cIt will be a special line. A diamond which glows in a night club, in a theater or even in the rays of sun,\u201d Ivanov said. \u201cWe see this demand in opinion polls and are sure that we will convert it into sales.\u201d", "description": "Russia's Alrosa is talking to several global jewelery retailers about jointly marketing the miner's jewelery brand that uses fluorescent diamonds, as it strives to create a new niche for the natural stones.", "authors": ["Polina Devitt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427872599&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880M6", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
