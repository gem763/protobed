That\u2019s a fantastically low barrier to entry, and those capabilities match the scope of what a large percentage of people demand from a device, be it a tablet or a phone.\n\nBut, let\u2019s get one thing straight from the start: you\u2019re getting exactly what you pay for.\n\nI checked out two new tablets to see just how far your money can take you at this point. One is Amazon\u2019s latest $49 Fire 7 tablet, and the other is a $64 Walmart-exclusive device called the Onn tablet. They\u2019re very different tablets, though they have a few things in common: they\u2019re both sluggish, plastic-clad Android tablets with poor battery life, and their screens will turn counting pixels into a side hobby. Flaws aside, they might fit your needs perfectly.\n\nOur review of Amazon Fire 7 (2019) Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff It\u2019s very affordable\n\nSupports popular apps and games\n\nCameras are decent for video chatting Bad Stuff Limited app support\n\nPlastic build feels flimsy\n\nScreen is easy to smudge\n\nStrange button placement Buy for $49.99 from Amazon\n\nOur review of Onn Android Tablet (8-inch) Verge Score 6 out of 10 Good Stuff Affordable price\n\nIt runs Android 9 Pie Bad Stuff Cameras are atrocious\n\nThe speaker is weak\n\nWalmart\u2019s nav button impacts usability Buy for $64.00 from Walmart\n\nIf you\u2019re considering these two tablets, the first split in the road is software. Both come with a handful of preinstalled apps, but only one of these tablets has access to the Google Play Store, and with it, access to any app that you want to download. It\u2019s Walmart\u2019s Onn tablet. The Fire 7 uses Fire OS, Amazon\u2019s heavily modified version of Android, which drastically cuts back on the apps available for you to download.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Appstore is lacking in Google-made apps\n\nAmazon\u2019s \u201cAppstore\u201d offers several popular apps and games, like Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, Minecraft, and more. These official apps look and feel exactly how you expect them to. What you won\u2019t find here, in addition to the sheer breadth of apps and games available in Google\u2019s Play Store, are any of Google\u2019s apps. Google Chrome, Google Drive, and Google Photos are pillars for most Android users, as well as people who use iPhones, but you won\u2019t find them on Fire OS. Some convincing unofficial apps exist for Fire OS, like the \u201cYouTube\u201d app, which is merely a bookmark that opens a mobile version of YouTube.com on Amazon\u2019s Silk browser. It works in a pinch, but it\u2019s not ideal.\n\nThe Google app situation may improve in the future, since Google and Amazon patched up a dispute that will bring YouTube to Fire TV devices in exchange for Amazon\u2019s Prime Video getting Chromecast support. It\u2019s too early to tell if the bridge will extend to Amazon\u2019s cheap tablets. No Google support out of the box will be a deal-breaker for a lot of people, even if you\u2019re entrenched in Amazon\u2019s services. It is possible to side-load Google\u2019s apps to the Fire 7, if you\u2019re willing to do the legwork and accept the security implications, but most people won\u2019t want to do that and I\u2019m evaluating this tablet on what it can do with the services included.\n\nApp scarcity aside, the user interface on the Fire 7 will take some getting used to if you\u2019re accustomed to stock Android (software that closely matches Google\u2019s original Android design), or iOS. At the very least, it\u2019s effective at putting all of your Amazon content front and center, whether it be ebooks, Audible audiobooks, or Prime Video. If you have an Amazon Prime membership, using one of these tablets is a good way to take better advantage of it.\n\nAmazon\u2019s tablets (new and old) help you get more out of Prime\n\nAdditionally, this tablet is good for kids, thanks to parental control options, as well as the option to subscribe to Amazon\u2019s FreeTime Unlimited service, which provides access to \u201c20,000 premium, age-appropriate books, videos, Audible books, educational apps and games\u201d. Depending on their age, springing for the $99 Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet may be a smarter move, since it comes with a durable case; a complimentary year-long subscription to FreeTime Unlimited, and a two-year damage protection plan. The Onn tablet, on the other hand, cuts you loose to find parental controls and entertainment for a younger crowd on your own.\n\nWalmart\u2019s Onn has Android 9 Pie software, though not all is peachy. This budget tablet is slow to launch and run apps. The navigation at the screen\u2019s bottom squeezes in a discrete Walmart button, which reveals the retailer\u2019s preinstalled apps: Walmart, Walmart Grocery, Sam\u2019s Club, Vudu, and Books. Is this page worth its very own button in the system navigation? I\u2019ll never go to bat for preinstalled software, but this is especially egregious since it makes it even tougher to hit the back, home, and multitasking buttons without looking.\n\nOnn has Android 9 Pie, with an unforgivable Walmart nav button\n\nOnn\u2019s tablet rises above Amazon\u2019s Fire 7 by offering access to any app you can get in the Google Play Store (including Google\u2019s own apps), and the $15 premium is well worth the cost if accessing those apps is vital. However, the Fire 7 feels a little faster, likely due to its pared-down version of Android. Not just that, it\u2019s more responsive to touch, as well. It\u2019s not surprising that the Fire 7 is a more polished experience than Onn\u2019s. Amazon\u2019s tablet venture has spanned several generations at this point, and following Apple\u2019s practices, Fire OS software is made exclusively for Amazon\u2019s tablets and streaming sticks.\n\nBoth the Onn and Fire 7 are clumsy in the hardware department. This isn\u2019t surprising, given their low prices, but it\u2019s still disappointing to encounter them. The screens on these tablets are pixelated and grainy. Onn\u2019s 8-inch, 1200 x 800 LCD display looks slightly better than Amazon\u2019s smaller 1024 x 600 LCD display, though both look washed out in terms of color accuracy. Neither of these tablet screens utilize an oleophobic coating, meaning that you\u2019ll smudge them up with even the most brief and careful swipes and touches. Get used to polishing them with a microfiber cloth every time you use them. You can easily find glass screen protectors for the Fire 7 that have this coating, though the Onn tablet isn\u2019t popular enough to have its own bespoke accessories.\n\nIf you plan to video chat on a tablet, the Amazon Fire 7 is the clear winner. Its cameras aren\u2019t great, though it\u2019s a night and day difference compared to the Onn tablet. Onn\u2019s camera quality looks worse than my first flip phone. And whether you\u2019re chatting or watching a movie, make sure that you use headphones with either tablet. Both feature awkwardly placed speakers (along the plastic edge of the Fire 7, and on the rear of the Onn tablet) that are weak and sound muffled.\n\nDependable battery life is lacking in both tablets. Watching a 23-minute episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion on the Fire 7 dropped the battery percentage by about 20 percent. I could see the battery life dropping even while I browsed around the Fire 7\u2019s home screen. I experienced similar results with the Onn tablet.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse than bad battery life when you\u2019re using the tablet is bad battery life when you aren\u2019t. The Fire 7 and Onn tablets have incredibly short standby lifespans. Most modern Android devices, including phones and tablets, have stellar standby runtimes when you just leave them to sit around. Those battery-saving tricks haven\u2019t been brought down to cheap tablets, or at least these ones. Throughout my week-long testing, each of these lasted a maximum of two days before needing to be recharged. And to rub some salt into the wound, they charge incredibly slowly via Micro USB. With 3 percent of battery capacity remaining, the Onn tablet tells me it will take four hours to recharge fully.\n\nI\u2019ve thrown a lot of shots at these tablets, though I still think they\u2019re low-risk purchases if you\u2019re short on cash and in need of some portable entertainment. At $49 and $64, respectively, you probably won\u2019t want to kick yourself if they get scratched up. Plus, they\u2019re useful for plane or train rides when you need to catch up on a book or watch a show.\n\nI rely heavily on Google\u2019s services, like Gmail and Google Photos, so I was ready to get behind Onn. Though, I think the Amazon Fire 7 is the more complete package. It runs faster than Walmart\u2019s Onn tablet, and the $24 protective case that Amazon sells is stylish and makes the Fire 7 look more premium.\n\nI love that $50 can buy a tablet that has cameras for video chatting, and supports apps like Twitter and Netflix. But, the kind of tablet that $50 can get you hasn\u2019t changed for the past few years. Affordable phone makers quickly figured out how to faithfully mimic more expensive devices, and I wish I could say the same about the cheap tablet scene. There\u2019s far less competition in tablets, which has all but halted progress in pushing design and value forward, and that may not change any time soon.", "description": "Compared to affordable phones, low-cost tablets, like Amazon\u2019s new Fire 7 and Walmart\u2019s Onn tablet, handle the basics, but not much else. Their low prices are their greatest asset, though both cut too many other corners for most people.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Jul", "Photo Amelia Holowaty Krales", "The Verge"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WWoXq3ENKkzV-QAMst4I66I91nQ=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16351245/akrales_190617_3490_0051.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-02"}
