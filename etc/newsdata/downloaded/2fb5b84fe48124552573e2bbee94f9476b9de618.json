But any discussion that\n\nthe two sides are close to agreeing on the text of a draft deal\n\nis \"premature,\" two EU officials told Reuters. Already higher on the day, the pound jumped above its\n\n200-day moving average, a closely watched technical level, for\n\nthe first time since May. It was last up 1.35% to $1.278, having\n\nearlier hit $1.280, a five-month high.\n\n\"The reaction from the markets shows they want to get this\n\ndeal over and they are ready to push the button at the slightest\n\nsign of a deal,\" said Morten Lund, a senior FX strategist at\n\nNordea.\n\nAgainst the euro EURGBP= , the pound was also at a\n\nfive-month high, last 1.34% stronger at 0.863 per euro. Against\n\na broad basket of its rivals , the dollar was down 0.15%\n\nto 98.309.\n\nThe Brexit news reversed a dollar rally earlier in the day\n\nas fading optimism over the latest China-U.S. trade truce\n\nprompted traders to buy the greenback after a selloff last week.\n\nThe combination of some tepid U.S. data and hopes of a\n\nbreakthrough in a protracted trade conflict between Washington\n\nand Beijing prompted funds to unwind some of their dollar long\n\nbets recently, putting the U.S. currency under selling pressure.\n\n\"After the recent flushout of dollar long bets, currency\n\ninvestors have reassessed the short-term outlook and have come\n\nto the view that there is not going to be much of a movement on\n\nthe trade issue,\" said Stephen Gallo, European Head of FX\n\nStrategy at BMO.\n\nReports of a \"Phase 1\" trade deal between the United States\n\nand China last week had initially cheered markets but the dearth\n\nof details around the agreement has since curbed this\n\nenthusiasm, with oil prices extending declines and Chinese\n\nstocks weaker.\n\nFading hopes over a trade deal also pulled the Chinese\n\ncurrency lower. China's yuan CNH= slipped in offshore markets,\n\na day after reaching a one-month high. The offshore yuan traded\n\nat 7.083 against the dollar, off Monday's high of 7.051.\n\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC-World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Sterling jumps, dollar falls on Brexit deal optimism", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/us_dollar_coins_800x533_L_1411474240.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
