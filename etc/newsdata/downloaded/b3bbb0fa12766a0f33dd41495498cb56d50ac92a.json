Listen to Katy Perry\u2019s summer smash \u201cNever Really Over\u201d, or Taylor Swift\u2019s feminist clap back \u201cThe Man\u201d, and you\u2019ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017\u2019s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIf there\u2019s any justice, its follow-up, Saves the World, should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single \u201cNumber One Fan\u201d banishes intrusive thoughts \u2013 \u201cNobody likes me and I\u2019m gonna die\u201d \u2013 just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek.\n\nElsewhere, they are downright defeatist. \u201cStay Away\u201d, whose clipped melody tap dances over Daft Punk-like pulses, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex. \u201cTaken\u201d reflects on a lover\u2019s similarity to an adulterous father, while \u201cHands Off\u201d toys with temptation before slamming the door shut: \u201cNo you can\u2019t touch, get your hands off me\u201d.

I think maybe I was wrong to think I could make it hurt less with a chorus singalong\u201d. They should give their own music a try. Alexandra Pollard\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The 30 best album covers - ranked 1/30 30) The Strokes \u2013 Is This It Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance \u2013 after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band\u2019s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He\u2019d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous \u201cass shot\u201d. The photograph, Lane later revealed in interviews, was taken in either late 1999 or 2000. His girlfriend had just got out of the shower, while he was playing with an old polaroid camera. He found a Chanel glove and asked her to pose. \u201cShooting on a Big Shot isn\u2019t easy: you can only shoot from a specific distance, and it\u2019s really designed for head-and-shoulders portraits,\u201d he explained to The Guardian. \u201cBut when she slid the glove on and bent forward, I knew it was the perfect shot \u2013 simple, straightforward, graphic and just so sexy.\u201d For fans, the image represents one of the last definable scenes in music. 2/30 29) The Notorious BIG \u2013 Ready to Die Biggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album\u2019s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact. 3/30 28) David Bowie \u2013 Aladdin Sane It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet; a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face. 4/30 27) Nas \u2013 Illmatic One of the greatest debut albums \u2013 and arguably the best hip hop record \u2013 of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch\u2019s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper\u2019s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas\u2019s entire world, \u201cuntil I educated myself to see there\u2019s more out there\u201d. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling. 5/30 26) Kate Bush \u2013 The Dreaming Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her \u201cshe\u2019s gone mad\u201d album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini\u2019s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist\u2019s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was \u2013 and still is \u2013 associated. 6/30 25) Oasis \u2013 Definitely Maybe Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned \u2013 Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead\u2019s house in Manchester. Jones didn\u2019t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead\u2019s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones\u2019s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. \u201cYeah, global dominance,\u201d he said. Soon after the album\u2019s release, that\u2019s exactly what happened. 7/30 24) Rolling Stones \u2013 Sticky Fingers Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger. 8/30 23) Miles Davis \u2013 Bitches Brew German painter Mati Klarwein \u2013 who also created Santana\u2019s artwork for Abraxas \u2013 was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis\u2019s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself; challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love. 9/30 22) AC/DC \u2013 Back in Black Back in Black\u2019s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, AC/DC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren\u2019t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history. 10/30 21) Blondie \u2013 Parallel Lines Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines\u2019 cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. \u201cI\u2019m not impressed,\u201d her stance seems to say. \u201cTry harder.\u201d 11/30 20) Bob Dylan \u2013 The Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: \u201cHe wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.\u201d Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin\u2019 Time, also noted the cover\u2019s significance, how it \u201cinfluenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility\u201d. 12/30 19) Led Zeppelin \u2013 Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin couldn\u2019t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It\u2019s an easy tactic \u2013 using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music. 13/30 18) Never Mind the Bollocks \u2013 Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols \u201cThe album will last. The sleeve may not,\u201d said the adverts for the Sex Pistols\u2019 first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks \u2013 Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols. They\u2019d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word \u201cbollocks\u201d on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history. 14/30 17) The Roots \u2013 Things Fall Apart For a limited time, The Roots\u2019 Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world\u2019s \u201cgreatest turmoils\u201d. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot \u2013 a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers. \u201cThis became the main artwork for a few reasons,\u201d art director Kenny Gravillis told Complex magazine. \u201cThe cover felt like the urban community could really relate to it. Seeing real fear in the woman's face is very affecting. It feels unflinching and aggressive in its commentary on society. I remember going to Tower Records and seeing it huge; it was just so impactful. I'm not sure that it would work today. I give MCA respect for pushing it out at the time.\u201d 15/30 16) Pink Floyd \u2013 Wish You Were Here Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson's geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here \u2013 taken by Aubrey \u2018Po\u2019 Powell \u2013 is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of \u201cgetting burnt\u201d. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so. 16/30 15) Fleetwood Mac \u2013 Rumours Just two of Fleetwood Mac\u2019s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood\u2019s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record\u2019s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it\u2019s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel. 17/30 14) Yeah Yeah Yeahs \u2013 It\u2019s Blitz! The instantly iconic cover of It\u2019s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There\u2019s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman\u2019s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive. 18/30 13) Madonna \u2013 True Blue This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d and \u201cYou Can Dance\u201d covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol\u2019s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna\u2019s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand. 19/30 12) The Clash \u2013 London Calling The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything \u201csafe\u201d that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith\u2019s photograph of \u201cthe ultimate rock\u2019n\u2019roll moment \u2013 total loss of control\u201d. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he\u2019d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment \u2013 just like The Clash. 20/30 11) Elvis Presley \u2013 Elvis Presley Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It\u2019s a visual introduction to rock\u2019n\u2019roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans. 21/30 10) NWA \u2013 Straight Outta Compton Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA\u2019s members to stand over him, with one holding \u201cwhat was hopefully an unloaded\u201d gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers. 22/30 9) Bruce Springsteen \u2013 Born in the USA The Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen\u2019s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist\u2019s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day\u2019s grind. \u201cWe took a lot of different types of pictures,\u201d said Springsteen, \u201cand in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.\u201d Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen\u2019s music. 23/30 8) The Ramones \u2013 The Ramones An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley \u2013 a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes. 24/30 7) The Beatles \u2013 Abbey Road Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it\u2019s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road\u2019s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision. 25/30 6) Grace Jones \u2013 Island Life Before he tried to \u201cbreak the internet\u201d with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones\u2019s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose; it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history. 26/30 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico \u2013 The Velvet Underground and Nico Like the working zipper of The Rolling Stones\u2019 Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to \u201cPeel slowly and see\u201d, upon which they\u2019d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It\u2019s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover. 27/30 4) Joy Division \u2013 Unknown Pleasures The cover art for Joy Division\u2019s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester\u2019s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 \u2013 from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. \u201cThe duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,\u201d Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. \u201cIts white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn't draw you in, the music will. 28/30 3) Nirvana \u2013 Nevermind Nirvana \u2013 Nevermind This is one of the most recognisable album covers of all time, and makes a fierce, mocking statement about the value western society places on chasing wealth \u2013 and the way it passes that message onto future generations. Record label Geffen were concerned by the appearance of three-month old Spencer Elden's penis on the cover, but Kurt Cobain would only accept a censor sticker over the image if it read: \u201cIf you're offended by this, you must be a closet paedophile.\u201d 29/30 2) The Beatles \u2013 Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, \u201cyou also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for\u201d. 30/30 1) Patti Smith \u2013 Horses Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder. \u201cThe only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,\u201d Smith told NPR in 2010. \u201cI got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, 'I got it'.\u201d 1/30 30) The Strokes \u2013 Is This It Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance \u2013 after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band\u2019s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He\u2019d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous \u201cass shot\u201d. The photograph, Lane later revealed in interviews, was taken in either late 1999 or 2000. His girlfriend had just got out of the shower, while he was playing with an old polaroid camera. He found a Chanel glove and asked her to pose. \u201cShooting on a Big Shot isn\u2019t easy: you can only shoot from a specific distance, and it\u2019s really designed for head-and-shoulders portraits,\u201d he explained to The Guardian. \u201cBut when she slid the glove on and bent forward, I knew it was the perfect shot \u2013 simple, straightforward, graphic and just so sexy.\u201d For fans, the image represents one of the last definable scenes in music. 2/30 29) The Notorious BIG \u2013 Ready to Die Biggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album\u2019s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact. 3/30 28) David Bowie \u2013 Aladdin Sane It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet; a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face. 4/30 27) Nas \u2013 Illmatic One of the greatest debut albums \u2013 and arguably the best hip hop record \u2013 of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch\u2019s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper\u2019s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas\u2019s entire world, \u201cuntil I educated myself to see there\u2019s more out there\u201d. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling. 5/30 26) Kate Bush \u2013 The Dreaming Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her \u201cshe\u2019s gone mad\u201d album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini\u2019s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist\u2019s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was \u2013 and still is \u2013 associated. 6/30 25) Oasis \u2013 Definitely Maybe Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover.

The sleeve may not,\u201d said the adverts for the Sex Pistols\u2019 first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks \u2013 Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols.

Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history. 14/30 17) The Roots \u2013 Things Fall Apart For a limited time, The Roots\u2019 Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world\u2019s \u201cgreatest turmoils\u201d. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot \u2013 a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers. \u201cThis became the main artwork for a few reasons,\u201d art director Kenny Gravillis told Complex magazine. \u201cThe cover felt like the urban community could really relate to it. Seeing real fear in the woman's face is very affecting. It feels unflinching and aggressive in its commentary on society. I remember going to Tower Records and seeing it huge; it was just so impactful. I'm not sure that it would work today. I give MCA respect for pushing it out at the time.\u201d 15/30 16) Pink Floyd \u2013 Wish You Were Here Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson's geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here \u2013 taken by Aubrey \u2018Po\u2019 Powell \u2013 is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of \u201cgetting burnt\u201d. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so. 16/30 15) Fleetwood Mac \u2013 Rumours Just two of Fleetwood Mac\u2019s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood\u2019s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record\u2019s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it\u2019s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel. 17/30 14) Yeah Yeah Yeahs \u2013 It\u2019s Blitz! The instantly iconic cover of It\u2019s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There\u2019s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman\u2019s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive. 18/30 13) Madonna \u2013 True Blue This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d and \u201cYou Can Dance\u201d covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol\u2019s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna\u2019s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand. 19/30 12) The Clash \u2013 London Calling The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything \u201csafe\u201d that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith\u2019s photograph of \u201cthe ultimate rock\u2019n\u2019roll moment \u2013 total loss of control\u201d. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he\u2019d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment \u2013 just like The Clash. 20/30 11) Elvis Presley \u2013 Elvis Presley Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It\u2019s a visual introduction to rock\u2019n\u2019roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans. 21/30 10) NWA \u2013 Straight Outta Compton Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA\u2019s members to stand over him, with one holding \u201cwhat was hopefully an unloaded\u201d gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers. 22/30 9) Bruce Springsteen \u2013 Born in the USA The Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen\u2019s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist\u2019s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day\u2019s grind. \u201cWe took a lot of different types of pictures,\u201d said Springsteen, \u201cand in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.\u201d Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen\u2019s music. 23/30 8) The Ramones \u2013 The Ramones An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley \u2013 a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes. 24/30 7) The Beatles \u2013 Abbey Road Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it\u2019s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road\u2019s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision. 25/30 6) Grace Jones \u2013 Island Life Before he tried to \u201cbreak the internet\u201d with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones\u2019s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose; it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history. 26/30 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico \u2013 The Velvet Underground and Nico Like the working zipper of The Rolling Stones\u2019 Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to \u201cPeel slowly and see\u201d, upon which they\u2019d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It\u2019s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover. 27/30 4) Joy Division \u2013 Unknown Pleasures The cover art for Joy Division\u2019s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester\u2019s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 \u2013 from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. \u201cThe duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,\u201d Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. \u201cIts white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn't draw you in, the music will. 28/30 3) Nirvana \u2013 Nevermind Nirvana \u2013 Nevermind This is one of the most recognisable album covers of all time, and makes a fierce, mocking statement about the value western society places on chasing wealth \u2013 and the way it passes that message onto future generations. Record label Geffen were concerned by the appearance of three-month old Spencer Elden's penis on the cover, but Kurt Cobain would only accept a censor sticker over the image if it read: \u201cIf you're offended by this, you must be a closet paedophile.\u201d 29/30 2) The Beatles \u2013 Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, \u201cyou also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for\u201d. 30/30 1) Patti Smith \u2013 Horses Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder. \u201cThe only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,\u201d Smith told NPR in 2010. \u201cI got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, 'I got it'.\u201d\n\nIggy Pop \u2013 Free\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nAhead of the release of his 2016 album Post Pop Depression, a polished and energised collaboration with Josh Homme, Iggy Pop teased that it may be his swansong. Free, therefore, arrives somewhat unexpectedly. The iconoclast\u2019s 18th solo album is built this time not on an intriguing musical partnership, but unwieldy and uncertain jam sessions. It feels less cohesive as a result, a likely polarising listen that sees Pop embracing the guises of poet and provocateur, but with an admirable disinterest in whether the two ever satisfactorily coalesce.\n\nSeveral tracks are in the traditional Pop vein. \u201cJames Bond\u201d is his funky, double entendre-filled attempt at a 007 theme, while \u201cDirty Sanchez\u201d, a grimy call-and-response number, appears to be a winking critique of modern sexual mores. \u201cYou desensitised sluts always playing with your butts,\u201d Pop sneers. \u201cThis online porn is driving me nuts\u201d.\n\nMore intriguing, however, are the spoken-word tracks. Free often feels like the messiest kind of improv, full of stream-of-consciousness expressions and storytelling that doesn\u2019t follow any particular logic. But tracks like the tense \u201cGlow in the Dark\u201d or the sombre \u201cThe Dawn\u201d are also oddly irresistible, loose, thoughtful and free-wheeling. \u201cThe darkness is like a challenger,\u201d Pop says on the latter, over a dreamy and sparse soundscape full of erotic-thriller saxophones and humming basslines. \u201cIn my stage of the game, he\u2019ll point out memories... the few moments that make life any f***ing good and he\u2019ll put those in my face in the dark.\u201d\n\nIn tracks like these, Free transforms not so much into a finite record, but one that feels like a lyrical wind-down, Pop pondering the road ahead and trying to make sense of it. Adam White\n\nChrissie Hynde \u2013 Valve Bone Woe\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nThe music industry offers few surprises in 2019. Even surprise albums feel cliched. So it\u2019s a delight to find Chrissie Hynde, rock legend of The Pretenders fame, is releasing\u2026 a jazz standards album.\n\nConceived after Hynde finished recording \u201cI Wish You Love\u201d for the 2000 film Eye of the Beholder (she wanted to do a more jazz-oriented album), Valve Bone Woe offers an impressive array of covers of classic songwriters such as Frank Sinatra, John Coltrane and Brian Wilson.\n\nMany of the covers work well \u2013 opener \u201cHow Glad I Am\u201d, which gave Nancy Wilson a hit single in 1964, bursts in with big-band swagger and Hynde\u2019s smoky croon. Her take on the Beach Boys\u2019 \u201cCaroline, No\u201d is stunning, not least for some psychedelic flourishes in between the wistful flutes and stately horns.\n\nElsewhere, though, the coolness in Hynde\u2019s voice occasionally fails to convey the genuine pain and anguish of the earlier incarnations. While the piano and string arrangements on \u201cI\u2019m a Fool to Want You\u201d are particularly lovely, you can\u2019t help but think of Frank Sinatra or Billie Holiday singing the same song, both versions of which have the power to move you to tears.\n\nOverall, though, Valve Bone Woe is a lovingly crafted collection of covers \u2013 a surprising, successful new endeavour by an artist evidently still keen to challenge herself.
