The following day, the young mum went to the hospital, and it was here that she learned that her cancer had not only returned, but that \u2014 this time \u2014 it\u2019s terminal.\n\nSince then, Sinead and Daniel have done everything they can to enjoy what little time they\u2019ve got left together, but they were left further heartbroken last week when \u2014 after an appointment with the oncologist \u2014 they discovered that Sinead only has a matter of weeks left to live.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSinead will attempt to make the most of her time left, and her friends and family rally round her to make her final few days incredibly special, before they\u2019re forced to bid a final farewell to her. Coronation Street has revealed that Sinead\u2019s life will come to an end at the end of next week in two incredibly moving episodes focusing solely on the final day of her life.\n\nA half-hour episode \u2014 which will be broadcast on Thursday 24th October \u2014 before a special one hour instalment on Friday 25th October, and both will centre on Sinead having to come to terms with the fact that she will never see her son Bertie grow up, while Daniel will be forced to say goodbye to his one true love, before facing the prospect of life as a single father.\n\nOn his time with working with Katie McGlynn, actor Rob said: \u2018Daniel and Sinead\u2019s relationship has been so believable and real. I find it quite difficult to switch off after emotional scenes, I feel so drained after a scene that\u2019s involved a lot of crying. I guess the grieving process you see on screen will be a lot easier to play because Daniel\u2019s sad that Sinead\u2019s gone, and I\u2019m devastated that Katie\u2019s gone.\u2019\n\nKatie said: \u2018When we filmed our last scenes it felt real. I know what a terrific actor Rob is and how he\u2019s going to play the next part of this story without me, and I just feel sorry for Daniel\u2019s character. It\u2019s going to be the end of an era because I\u2019ve really enjoyed working with him.\u2019\n\nSinead\u2019s final Coronation Street episodes will air on Thursday 24th October and Friday 25th October.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Emotional scenes ahead.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/daniel-sinead-bed-31d2_1571086877.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
