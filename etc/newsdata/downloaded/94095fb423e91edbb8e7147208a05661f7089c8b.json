Romiro Bravo Morales, 22 (right), who was in the country illegally, has been charged with being an accessory to murder\n\nChristopher Ross, 47 (left), who called to report the theft, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter for failing to tell police that he was involved in a dispute with the two men at the farm. Officer Ishmael is pictured right\n\nA fourth man - Jorge Lamas, an American citizen who has been living in Mexico for years - was also charged Tuesday, according to the Sacramento Bee.\n\nLamas is accused of overseeing a conspiracy to grow at least 50 marijuana plants at two locations in California, including the one where Officer Ishmael was shot.\n\nHe was also charged with drug trafficking and firearms offences, the paper reports.\n\nInvestigators say Ross called police Wednesday morning to report a theft from his marijuana farm in Somerset, around 50 miles outside Sacramento.\n\nHowever, they say he failed to mention the fact that he was leasing the land to the two men and that the trio were involved in a business dispute.\n\n'Had he been truthful with our deputies and the 911 dispatcher, this tragedy would not have occurred,' El Dorado County Sheriff John D'Agostini said.\n\nOfficer Ishmael and an off-duty police officer who was accompanying him for a ride-along were dispatched to the scene.\n\nWhen they arrived and announced their presence, 'they were immediately confronted with gunfire,' D'Agostini said. Both returned fire.\n\nPolice say that had deputies been aware of Ross's dispute with the two men at the farm, 'this tragedy would not have occurred' (pictured, police near the scene)\n\nIshmael was shot twice during a hail of gunfire - once in the foot and once in the chest, above his bullet-proof vest - and died within minutes. A second officer was also shot in the thigh, while murder suspect Orozco also had to be treated for gunshot wounds\n\nIshmael, 37, was struck once in the upper chest, above his bulletproof vest, and once in the foot, the sheriff said.\n\nThe off-duty deputy, whose name has not been made public, was hit once in the upper thigh and tried to help Ishmael, but was unable to save the officer who bled out within minutes.\n\nRoss, 47, is charged with involuntary manslaughter and jailed on $50,000 bail, records show.\n\nThe suspected gunman, Juan Carlos Vasquez Orozco, underwent surgery for gunshot wounds, D'Agostini said.\n\nHe was arrested on suspicion of murder and assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nMorales is charged with being an accessory and is in custody on $250,000 bail.\n\nPolice have confirmed that Morales is an illegal immigrant, but say they are still trying to establish whether Orozco was in the country illegally.\n\nIshmael was a four-year veteran of the sheriff's office and had worked two years for the Placerville Police Department. He is survived by a wife and three daughters.", "description": "Carlos Vasquez Orozco, 20, a Mexican national (pictured), has been charged with murder after allegedly firing the shot that killed California Deputy\u00a0Brian Ishmael early Wednesday.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/09/20366110-0-image-a-21_1572427140901.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
