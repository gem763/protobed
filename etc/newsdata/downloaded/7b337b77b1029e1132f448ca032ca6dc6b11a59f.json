It was the first serious response to Tesla's Model S sedan from a major automaker, and few automakers are more serious than Porsche. On Wednesday, almost exactly four years to the day, it finally revealed the production version of that concept. It's called the Taycan, and it'll be built at the company's home in Zuffenhausen, Germany, with deliveries starting before the end of the year.\n\nIt's fair to say that the Taycan is one of the most hotly anticipated cars of the year, although Porsche's lengthy campaign of teasing out tiny nuggets of info here and there has surely been grating for some. But the embargo is over now, and we can share all we know about this impressive new battery-electric vehicle. And \"impressive\" is the right word\u2014the car is capable of withstanding 26 2.6-second 0-60mph launches in short succession, and it can lap the N\u00fcrburgring in 7 minutes and 42 seconds without overtaxing its lithium-ion battery pack.\n\nAn 800V electrical architecture\n\nYou could be forgiven for thinking that the Taycan is basically an Audi e-tron under the skin. Audi and Porsche share a corporate parent, and both BEVs were greenlit around the same time in the wake of dieselgate . However, the two vehicles' powertrains share no parts, despite superficially similar specs. Porsche opted for an 800V high voltage architecture; until now almost every other BEV from Audi to Tesla and all stops in between have used 400V. Among the benefits of this higher voltage are faster charging\u2014currently at up to 270kW, although Porsche thinks 400-500kW should be possible in time\u2014as well as reduced weight and better packaging thanks to much thinner wires (because more volts mean fewer amps).\n\nThe Taycan's battery pack is where you expect to find it, between the front and rear axles of the car. The 93.4kWh pack contains 396 64.6Ah lithium-ion pouch cells with a nominal voltage of 723V and a maximum power output of 620kW. (The pack is a parallel arrangement of two sets of 198 cells, so the overall current is 130A.) The 1,367lb (620kg) battery pack is bolted into the monocoque chassis as an integral component, which Porsche says makes for easier assembly and also allows for servicing. It designed the battery's structural frame to dissipate loads around and between the cells in the event of a head-on, rear, or side impact collision, and the pack contributes to the body's overall stiffness, which Porsche says is the highest of any of its production cars. The battery has its own low-temperature liquid cooling circuit that also cools the car's DC-DC converter and the high voltage booster. (A separate mid-temperature cooling circuit cools the rear axle module, and a heating circuit is there for the high voltage heater and also the HVAC system.)\n\nTaycan Turbo or Taycan Turbo S?\n\nPorsche is launching the Taycan in two specs: the Taycan Turbo and the Taycan Turbo S. (Yes, I know there's nothing to turbocharge\u2014it's a triumph of marketing over logic that we're all going to have to deal with.) The all-wheel drive powertrains are almost identical in both, and in normal driving both versions even output the same 460kW (616hp) from two permanent magnet synchronous motor-generator units, located fore and aft of the battery pack. Porsche says it chose this design over induction or permanent magnet asynchronous MGUs because they're compact and offer high-power density but also offer good thermal behavior\u2014which means consistent performance, even though the cost is higher. The coils in the MGU are of a hairpin winding design, rather than the more common pull-in winding technique. Porsche said that these hairpins\u2014rectangular copper bars bent into a U shape\u2014allow more copper fill inside the motor (70% versus 40% for pull-in winding), and more copper means more power and torque. (Porsche also claims that the hairpin design is easier to insulate and cool.)\n\nThe rear MGU, which weighs 375lbs (170kg), provides 335kW (449hp) and 550Nm (406lb-ft) at a maximum motor speed of 16,000rpm in normal use. It's packaged parallel to the axle, which it drives through a two-speed gearbox. Although EVs with more than one gear ratio in their transmissions are uncommon outside of the Formula E paddock (Tesla's Model S uses a single reduction gear), Porsche chose to fit one to the Taycan so that it could maximize acceleration from low speed without eating into cruise speed efficiency. The decision also yields a top speed of 161mph (260km/h)\u2014important for a vehicle sold in the German market, where it might occasionally find itself on unlimited-speed roads. The short planetary first gear is engaged via a dog clutch and is used up to speeds of about 65mph (105km/h). When it's time for second gear the dog clutch opens (which disengages the planetary gears) and a multiplate clutch closes with no torque loss when shifting.\n\nPorsche\n\nPorsche\n\nPorsche\n\nPorsche\n\nPorsche\n\nPorsche\n\nIt all comes down to launch control\n\nThe primary difference between Turbo and Turbo S is at the front axle, where a second MGU drives the wheels via a single-speed planetary gearbox that's rated at +450Nm (332lb-ft) for traction torque and -300Nm (221lb-ft) for regeneration. Specifically, they differ in terms of the pulse-controlled inverter that converts DC to three-phase AC for the front MGU. In the Taycan Turbo this normally provides a continuous 190A, which gives the motor 175kW (235hp) and 300Nm (221lb-ft). But when you activate launch control, the inverter can overboost the motor to 300A. Do that and the Taycan Turbo suddenly packs a hefty 500kW (670hp) and 850Nm (630lb-ft), albeit for just 2.5 seconds at a time. That makes even the Taycan Turbo faster than a McLaren F1 off the line; 0-60mph takes 3 seconds, then it's 3.2 seconds to 62mph (100km/h), 6.9 seconds to 100mph (160km/h), 10.6 seconds to 124mph (200km/h), with the standing quarter-mile (400m) dispatched in 11.1 seconds.\n\nIt's pretty darn fast around a corner, too\n\nThe Turbo S makes do with a doubly powerful front inverter. Normally it works at 380A, and the 168lb (76kg) MGU provides 190kW (256hp) and 400Nm (295lb-ft). But engage launch control in this one and that shoots up to a peak of 600A, which adds an extra 40Nm (30lb-ft) to the front wheels. The Turbo S rear MGU also ups its torque game to 610Nm (449lb-ft) in overboost and launch control, for a combined 560kW (750hp) and 1,050Nm (774lb-ft). This helps the Turbo S from a standstill to 60mph in a face-melting 2.6 seconds, then to the metric 100km/h in 2.8 seconds, 100mph in 6.3 seconds, 124mph in 9.8 seconds, and the standing quarter in 10.8 seconds. I'm pretty sure this still gives Tesla's P100D bragging rights at the drag strip, although you have to be prepared for downtime between runs as the battery prepares itself or recovers; as we saw last month, the Taycan needs no such time outs.\n\nIt'll be another few weeks before I get some alone-time behind the wheel of a Taycan, but I did get some passenger-seat time in a pre-production Turbo S while in Atlanta for the tech briefing. The company's American HQ is also home to a Porsche Experience Center, which includes a small test track, and it was here that a Porsche engineer drove me around for a few minutes. The violence of a standing start was remarkable, even to someone familiar with that kind of acceleration; I'll chalk it up to a very firm headrest and the fact that as a passenger it took me a little by surprise. But it's no surprise that EVs can accelerate quickly; what made my ride in the Taycan more remarkable was the way it coped in the corners, particularly for a large and relatively heavy car. A Taycan Turbo S will weigh around 5,121lbs (2,323kg) because the glass roof is a standard feature here, and the car is about as long (195.4 inches/4,963mm) and as wide (77.4 inches/1.966mm) as a Tesla Model S\u2014although it's a couple of inches shorter (54.3 inches/1,378mm).\n\nThe rear multilink suspension is one of the few places you'll find commonality with the Panamera\u2014specifically the rear control arms, although the rear subframe is unique to the Taycan and includes a structure that should prevent any suspension components from meeting the battery during a rear impact. The double wishbone suspension at the front is entirely new\u2014thanks to the tight packaging at the front, nothing off the shelf would have fit. Three-chamber air suspension and Porsche Active Suspension Management software is standard, which will change the ride height depending upon which drive mode you're in. Also standard is rear-wheel steering, which turns against the direction of the front wheels at low speed to decrease the car's turning circle, or with the front wheels at speed to increase stability. Finally, active roll bars\u2014known as Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control\u2014can be an optional extra that minimizes body roll and helps keep handling neutral.\n\nPart of the way the Taycan drives is down to the suspension\u2014that, and the car's wide track and low center of gravity thanks to the battery compartment. But the powertrain plays a part as well: the front and rear MGUs both have 2ms response times, which Porsche says is five times faster than its internal combustion engines. (It also says the traction control system is 10x faster than in conventionally powered Porsches.) There is fully variable torque distribution between front and rear axles (although limited obviously by the total output of each motor), and the system is capable of a 1,500Nm (1,106lb-ft) torque split across an axle.\n\nListing image by Christoph Bauer for Porsche", "description": "The teasing is over; now we can tell you about the new electric Porsche.", "authors": ["Jonathan M.
