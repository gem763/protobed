He said that President Trump wanted President Zelensky \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.\u201d\n\nVICE News asked a handful of members whether Taylor\u2019s testimony describes a quid pro quo between Trump and Zelensky. And they responded largely by criticizing the impeachment process.\n\n\u201cWhat's frustrating is all these individual little snippets of his testimony coming out. Who's leaking them? I think that that person should be tried as well. So it's not fair that the whole transcript isn't coming out,\u201d Rep. Roger Marshall (Kansas) said.\n\nArizona Congresswoman Debbie Lesko, a member of the Judiciary Committee, complained that she wasn\u2019t allowed to go in to watch Taylor\u2019s testimony, calling the process \u201cterrible and unfair.\u201d After VICE News read her the passage about Ukrainian security assistance being contingent upon ordering investigations, she said Taylor\u2019s testimony contradicts what Ambassador Sondland and the president have both said.\n\n\u201cSo you have the Ukrainian president himself who said there was no quid pro quo or ask,\u201d she said. \u201cYou've got the president of the United States saying there was none. ... So what his testimony does is contradict others. So it's kind of like a he-said, she-said.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the White House statement calling Taylor a \u201cradical, unelected bureaucrat\u201d was accurate, Lesko declined to answer.\n\nCover: Arizona Rep.
