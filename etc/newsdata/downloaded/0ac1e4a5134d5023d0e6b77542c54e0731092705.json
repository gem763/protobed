You don't have to be gay, there are good people with d**ks out there, you just gotta find them.\n\n\"You just gotta find a d**k that's not a d**k, you know what I mean?\"\n\nWhile Cody laughed in the background, she added, \"I always thought I had to be gay, because I just thought all guys are evil, but that's not true,\" no doubt a dig at her ex, Liam Hemsworth.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nFans of the former Disney Channel star took to Twitter and criticised her for the comment.\n\nOne frustrated fan wrote: \"Miley, this is so not it. Women don't 'have to be gay' because they 'can#t find a good person with a d*ck'.\n\n\"Don't use the queer community as a stop-gap because you couldn't find a boyfriend.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"People aren't queer because they 'gave up' on men. This is so insulting.\"\n\nAnother penned: \"From all the people in the world who could say this, miley is one of the last ones I could've thought of to try and invalidate queer women.\"\n\nMiley has always been open about her sexuality, but the controversial comment comes after she spoke about the importance of her identity as a queer woman while in a heterosexual relationship with Liam.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nAt the time, Miley was two months into her marriage with estranged actor husband Liam, 29.\n\nShe told Vanity Fair: \"A big part of my pride and my identity is being a queer person.\n\n\"What I preach is: People fall in love with people, not gender, not looks, not whatever.\"\n\nAfter Miley and Liam split, she was seen kissing Kaitlynn Carter by a pool in Lake Como and it wasn't long before the pair got together in September.\n\n(Image: Suzy Creamcheese / SplashNews.com)\n\nThe couple were spotted out in Los Angeles shortly after wearing near identical looks.\n\nAt some moments during their walk Kaitlynn tenderly placed a hand on Miley's stomach, while they had an animated conversation.\n\nBut just a few weeks after they were seen together, the girls called an end to their relationship.\n\nA source said: \"They're still friends.\n\n\"They've been friends forever and were there for each other when they were both getting separated.\n\n\"But they're just not in a romantic relationship anymore.\"", "description": "The popstar has upset gay and bisexual women by suggesting that they are queer because they 'gave up' on men", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Instagram", "Suzy Creamcheese", "Splashnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20664142.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Miley-Cyrus.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
