REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\n\u201cThis is Us\u201d star Sterling K. Brown and \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d comic Kate McKinnon also walked the purple carpet as nominees and presenters made their way into the Los Angeles ceremony in sweltering heat on Sunday.\n\nOn a night that could see old favorites prevailing over the biggest lineup of first-time nominees in eight years, HBO political satire \u201cVeep\u201d and returning Emmy champ \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs Maisel\u201d from Amazon Studios, along with their stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Rachel Brosnahan, are seen as frontrunners in the contest for best comedy series.\n\nYet Waller-Bridge could pull off an upset with one or both of her buzzy shows - female-driven BBC America thriller \u201cKilling Eve\u201d and Amazon comedy \u201cFleabag,\u201d which drew 20 Emmy nominations between them.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a tight race,\u201d said Louis-Dreyfus, who is competing for her seventh lead actress Emmy in her role as a nakedly ambitious politician hell-bent on becoming U.S. president in \u201cVeep.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very, very fine group of actors and shows. There\u2019s no getting around it. Really, truthfully, I can\u2019t believe how good television is right now,\u201d Louis-Dreyfus told Reuters ahead of the ceremony.\n\nThe 71st Emmy awards show, chosen by members of the Television Academy, will be broadcast live on Fox, starting at 8 p.m. EDT/5 p.m. PDT (midnight GMT).\n\nAlready the most-awarded series in Emmy history with 38 wins, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d landed a record 32 nominations for its final season, including nine for its actors, despite a fan uproar over the conclusion of the series.\n\nThe haul for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d helped cable channel HBO lead all comers with 137 Emmy nominations this year, ahead of Netflix with 117, reflecting the battle for dominance between traditional outlets and streaming services.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great year for diversity on all levels. There are hot new shows competing against Emmy incumbents, so there will be a lot at stake in an industry that is undergoing a revolution,\u201d said Tom O\u2019Neil, founder of awards website GoldDerby.com.\n\nRelated Coverage Factbox: Key nominations for the 2019 Emmy awards\n\nNone of the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actresses has ever won an Emmy, and this year they face formidable competition from \u201cKilling Eve\u201d co-stars Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer as well as Laura Linney for drug-trafficking thriller \u201cOzark.\u201d\n\nOne of the closest races is in the limited series category in which the wrenching social justice drama \u201cWhen They See Us\u201d faces off against Soviet nuclear accident tale \u201cChernobyl\u201d and \u201cFosse/Verdon,\u201d starring Michelle Williams as Broadway singer and dancer Gwen Verdon.\n\nIn the actor contest, Billy Porter is considered the favorite for his role in LGBTQ series \u201cPose\u201d on FX after a breakout year in which he made waves on the Oscar and Met Gala red carpets for his groundbreaking gender-neutral outfits.", "description": "\"Game of Thrones\" nominee Peter Dinklage and series co-star Gwendoline Christie, \"Hamilton\" musical creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and British writer-actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge were among early arrivals for television's Emmy awards on Sunday, where HBO's medieval fantasy series aims to crown its final season with a fourth best drama series statuette despite an array of new contenders.", "authors": ["Jill Serjeant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432751728&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0VK", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
