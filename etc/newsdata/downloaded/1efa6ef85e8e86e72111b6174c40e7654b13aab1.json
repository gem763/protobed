Did she just make it up as she went?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had faith in her to get it done,\u201d Mr Clements said. He said he was never involved in details.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNobody knew that office better than Kaila. Nobody was able to master details better than Kaila.\u201d\n\nMr Robertson suggested Mr Clements was \u201cattempting to distance yourself from any fundraising matter because you know they are of concern to this commission?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m answering questions honestly,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Monday, ICAC was told that after Mr Clements stepped down as state secretary in January 2016 Mr Huang engaged him as a consultant on a $200,000 a year retainer and provided him with a rent-free office.\n\n'Best that we all tell the truth'\n\nMeanwhile, family members of former Labor candidate Jonathan Yee have terminated links with the Emperor\u2019s Garden restaurant in Sydney's Chinatown, in the aftermath of a series of disastrous appearances before ICAC.\n\nJonathan Yee . . . his name is off the family business after ICAC testimony. Wolter Peeters\n\nOn October 3, Jonathan Yee, his brother Valentine and their mother, May Ho Yee, all resigned as directors of the operating company, Emperor's Garden, and transferred their shares to the family patriarch, Stanley Yee, who founded the business 40 years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company filings came a day after Jonathan Yee finished giving evidence before ICAC about his role in disguising $100,000 in donations, which Mr Huang is alleged to have handed to the then state secretary Mr Clements at Labor\u2019s Sussex Street head office in April 2015.\n\nOn September 16, Valentine Yee in a humiliating backdown dramatically changed his earlier evidence at ICAC and admitted helping to hide the source of the $100,000 donation, at the urging of state Labor politician Ernest Wong.\n\nValentine Yee said he told the Yee family at a meeting in a private room at the Emperor\u2019s Garden the previous day: \"I think it's best that we all tell the truth.\"\n\nLast week, Jonathan Yee told ICAC he met Mr Wong at the Chinese Masonic Society in Surry Hills on September 15 and told him \"we can no longer tell lies because ... the shit has hit the fan\" and his brother Valentine was going to \"spill the beans\" in his evidence at the ICAC.\n\nMr Yee said that Mr Wong had asked to speak to his father, Stanley Yee, who had told Mr Wong to \u201cpiss off\u201d and \u201cstop \u2018effing\u2019 with my family\u201d.\n\nMr Wong has denied any role in preparing false donor forms.\n\nPatricia Siu, a cashier and waitress at Emperor's Garden, Teresa Tam, a casual waitress, former manager Lei Mo, and former assistant manager Johnnie Lin, have subsequently all told ICAC that they had given false evidence that they were donors, at the instigation of Jonathan Yee.", "description": "Former NSW Labor secretary Jamie Clements was accused of hating his former assistant secretary Kaila Murnain as he told a corruption inquiry he had no significant role in raising funds, which he left entirely to Ms Murnain.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2177%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7f6fda64283e41898f616a9f5ac10b4dc5301d2d", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
