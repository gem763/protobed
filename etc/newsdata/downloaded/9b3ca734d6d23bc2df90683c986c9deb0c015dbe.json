REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\n\nInvestors and analysts told Reuters that much of the explanation lies in Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook\u2019s skillful management of relationships in Washington, Beijing and Wall Street.\n\nCook has fostered a relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, dining with him and conveying Apple\u2019s views on tariffs and U.S. manufacturing. He has also kept strong enough relations with Chinese officials to avoid Apple\u2019s becoming a target of explicit retaliation after the U.S. government moved to cut off Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] - Apple\u2019s arch rival in the premium smartphone market in China - from American technology.\n\nAlong the way, Cook has persuaded Wall Street that Apple can transition from the iPhone to a broader constellation of products that includes streaming video and even a credit card, along with accessories like AirPods and the Apple Watch.\n\nEven investors who were already impressed by Cook\u2019s business acumen - he masterminded Apple\u2019s supply chain and operations under the late CEO Steve Jobs - have been pleasantly surprised by Cook\u2019s ability to avoid taking fatal arrows from either side in the U.S.-China trade war.\n\n\u201cWho would have thought he would have been able to thread that needle and deal with the president? It\u2019s a show of an incredible amount of nuance and emotional intelligence to do what\u2019s best for the company,\u201d said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Capital Investment Cos, an Apple shareholder.\n\nChina remains a challenge for Apple. Sales there fell sharply early in the current fiscal year when currency fluctuations put iPhones out of reach for many Chinese consumers. Apple cut prices, which helped, but rival Huawei has gained share.\n\nApple\u2019s share of the Chinese market fell to 5.2% in the calendar third quarter versus 7% a year ago, while Huawei, which sells many more low-cost models than Apple does, saw its market share surge to 42.4% from 24.9% the year before, Canalys data showed.\n\n\u201cA year ago, we were talking about the price pushback in China, and (Apple) contended they were overcoming that,\u201d said Tom Plumb, founder of Wisconsin Capital Management, an Apple shareholder. \u201cNow the real question is whether you\u2019re seeing a cultural shift that would bode poorly for Apple.\u201d\n\nBut many Apple investors have likely already priced in a loss of China market share to domestic rivals in the long term.\n\n\u201cIf the industry is worth being in, you should assume that over the course of time it\u2019s going to be dominated by Chinese national champions,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.\n\nCook has also persuaded investors that services such as Apple TV+, coming next month, will boost sales. Investors are optimistic, but worry that Apple could be drawn into spending battles over Hollywood talent against entrenched rivals such as Walt Disney Co.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not huge advocates of them spending huge amounts of cash reserves on content generation,\u201d said John Ham of New England Investment & Retirement Group Inc, which holds Apple shares. \u201cBut as long as they don\u2019t get carried away and start making outsized, egregious deals, then we would support them dabbling in this area.\u201d", "description": "When Apple Inc reports results on Wednesday, Wall Street expects flat fiscal fourth-quarter sales and lower full-year revenue compared with the prior year, mostly because of declining iPhone sales.
