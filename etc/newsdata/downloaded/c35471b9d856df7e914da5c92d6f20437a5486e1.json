This time, she voted for centrist Gesher party \u201cto see change\u201d.\n\n\u201c1 billion shekels were spent on this election. A billion. And for what? The politicians try to sell us nothing,\" she told The Independent.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He seems to be the sticking point in negotiations with other parties Daniel Katz, Israeli voter\n\nOther parties also refused to join citing Mr Netanyahu\u2019s likely indictment on graft charges.\n\nThis round, Mr Lieberman\u2019s party is expected to nearly double their seats but has preliminarily promised to join forces with centrist Blue and White party, which is headed by Israel\u2019s ex-army chief Benny Gantz, Mr Netanyahu\u2019s chief rival.\n\nIt could once again cost Mr Netanyahu his crown.\n\nThe last polls published over the weekend showed Mr Netanyahu neck and neck with Mr Gantz, with both their parties securing around 32 seats.\n\nThey also predicted, without Mr Lieberman neither Mr Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing block nor Mr Gantz\u2019s centre-left allies will be able to secure enough seats together to form a ruling government.\n\nAnd while the polls in Israel are notoriously wrong, in the last week a frenzied Mr Netanyahu has taken no chances.\n\nFeeling the heat, and that his career may be on the line, he stormed into the elections with all guns blazing.\n\nIn seven days, he promised to annex all Israeli settlements in the West Bank if he is re-elected, he mulled a defence treaty with President Trump, he visited Russia to see President Putin and he even, according to Israeli media, very nearly launched a military operation in Gaza.\n\nHe also agreed to a slew of media interviews, and on elections day released a steady flow of videos and messages warning that the Arab voter turnout was soaring and that the Left would be sure to win.\n\n\u201cWe are in the closest fight ever with\u2026 Gantz,\u201c he warned on Twitter as the day was drawing to a close.\n\n\u201cOnly you will decide whether a strong right-wing government will be formed under my leadership or a weak left-wing government led by Lapid-Gantz with the Arab parties.\u201d\n\nBut even these tried and tested method failed to impress his usual support base.\n\nIn Mea Shearim, an ultra-orthdox neighbourhood which usually votes for the religious parties but is also fiercely loyal to Mr Netanyahu, there was change in the air.\n\nMany agreed that while the Likud would likely win and there were few alternatives to Mr Netanyahu as prime minister, he was also losing support.\n\n\"It might be the end of Netanyahu, it feels like he might be holding the party back. He seems to be the sticking point in negotiations with other parties,\" said Daniel Katz, 33, a software developer voting for the ultraorthodox United Judaism Torah party.\"\n\n\u201cThe Likud has other people,\u201d he added trailing off.\n\nBibi is not royalty, it\u2019s time for a change Oshrat Zeev, Israeli voter\n\nMichael, 60, who said he is voting for hard-right Jewish Power party, agreed. Jewish Power is also likely to form a coalition with Likud.\n\n\u201cThe right will win but who exactly that will be is still up in the air - this election is much more ambiguous,\u201d he told The Independent.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu is regarded differently now, because of this election. There is a great deal of apathy from people because the fundamental issues which prevented the formation of a government last time haven\u2019t disappeared.\"\n\nIn Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s commercial capital, there was little love for Mr Netanyahu from leftist, centrist and Arab-Israeli voters, who were divided on whether the decline in his popularity would see their camp win.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is to switch out the king,\u201d said Iftah Gorali, a Blue and White voter, referencing Mr Netanyahu\u2019s nickname.\n\n\"The king is stuck in his place, we need to get rid of him, and our best chance is through Blue and White. I\u2019m more realistic than optimistic. There's always a chance,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the Arab neighbourhood of Jaffa, Eliran Ben Iolo, 32, another Blue and White supporter, agreed: \"It feels like it\u2019ll work, because Bibi\u2019s already lost it. Now you see he\u2019s throwing all kinds of punches, not smartly and not with any kind of understanding.\u201d\n\nBut David Horowitz, 64, who was voting for the leftist Democratic Union, said he feared a \u201cthird election\u201d.\n\nSami Haj, 21, who was undecided on who to vote for, was even less hopeful.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't matter [who you vote], it will be Bibi or no one. Every year it only gets worse.\u201d", "description": "The unifying cry across the leaflet-strewn polling stations of Israel, a country deeply divided, was \u201cplease - no more elections\u201d.
