Council nominates former Obama official to Metro board", "language": "en", "text": "The D.C. Council will nominate a former U.S. Department of Transportation official to represent the District as a voting member on the Metro board of directors, filling the seat left vacant by Council Member Jack Evans.\n\nCouncil chairman Phil Mendelson announced the nomination of Stephanie Gidigbi, an Obama appointee, on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited that with Stephanie we\u2019ve got someone who is a regular transit user, knowledgeable about transportation issues, and \u2013 as a resident of Ward 8 \u2013 committed to the District,\u201d Mr. Mendelson said. \u201cShe will be a fresh face on the [Metro] board and is sensitive to the changing technologies that are transforming transportation.\u201d\n\nMr. Evans resigned as chairman of the Metro board and stepped down from the board completely after an ethics investigation into whether he used his position to benefit the clients of his private consulting firm.\n\nA legal memo from an outside law firm conducting the investigation found he \u201cknowingly\u201d violated ethics rules to help friends and clients, and Mr. Evans acknowledged that he committed one ethics violation.\n\nMetro \u201ccould not have a better steward of the nation\u2019s transit agency than Stephanie Gidigbi,\u201d former U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said. \u201cShe is smart, energetic, full of integrity and passionate about ensuring equity in transportation. She\u2019s an outstanding choice.\u201d\n\nFollowing the ethics investigation, Corbett Price, the city\u2019s other member of the Metro board, also stepped down, leaving another vacancy that Mr. Mendelson said he hopes to fill soon. Mr. Price had faced scrutiny over his efforts to hide Mr. Evans\u2018 actions.\n\nMayor Muriel Bowser has nominated Lucinda Babers to replace Mr. Price on the board, which requires the council\u2019s approval.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
