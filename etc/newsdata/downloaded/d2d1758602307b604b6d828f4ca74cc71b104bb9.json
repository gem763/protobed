The Brighton teenager showed enough in an all-too-fleeting 12-minute debut during Saturday's goalless draw in Georgia to suggest he has something his elders do not - pace and the ability to frighten the opposition.\n\nMcCarthy knows the time has arrived to shed with conservatism. He was a player in 1992 when Ireland went through qualifying without loss but failed to make that summer's European Championships.\n\nMick McCarthy is ready to hand Aaron Connolly his first start against Switzerland\n\nAnother two draws in this campaign - against Switzerland in Geneva on Monday and Denmark in Dublin next month - would almost certainly see them miss out on automatic passage to the finals, even though it would leave them unbeaten in Group D.\n\nConnolly, 19, is the player to which McCarthy now looks set to turn, and so he should after the new boy emerged from the bench in Tbilisi and twice came close to nicking victory.\n\n'Absolutely he could start,' said McCarthy ahead of Monday's game at the Stade de Geneve.\n\n'You've seen him come on and do what he's done. We might have to have a bit of help with him though, he certainly won't be a lone runner.'\n\nRepiblic of Ireland boss McCarthy knows the time has arrived to shed with conservatism\n\nMcCarthy, it would appear, will consider pairing him in attack with a targetman such as Luton's James Collins, who battled admirably on his first start in Georgia but never looked like scoring.\n\nThe boss is keen to take the positives from Saturday's stalemate, even though it was a performance found wanting for attacking inspiration, until Connolly's belated arrival.\n\n'I asked them in the dressing-room after if they would have taken four points before we started, beat Georgia at home and draw away?' he said.\n\nConnolly (right) shakes hands with his team-mates after Saturday's draw with Georgia\n\n'They weren't all saying, \"Yeah\". And I said, \"Well I would\". Because that's how you qualify, that's how you win things. It might not end up like that, I know that, but winning at home and drawing away is not a bad recipe.'\n\nAnother away draw against Switzerland, however, will be largely academic. Ireland, with just six goals from as many games, need to score if they are to win.\n\nAnd that is why the time is right to start with Connolly.", "description": "CRAIG HOPE IN TBILISI: Republic of Ireland need to win just one of their two remaining matches and they will qualify for Euro 2020 - to that end, Mick McCarthy needs a match-winner.", "authors": ["Craig Hope For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/21/19665694-0-image-a-10_1570999297549.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
