He demands the best and demands the highest standards, and I think he has changed a bit over the last few years since he came in.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s realised he can relax a bit more at times around the squad, but the characters in the squad and the players he\u2019s got aren\u2019t going to take the foot off the gas.\n\n\u2018We work very hard and in every single training session he demands the best. You can see from him bouncing around on the sidelines how much it means to him, and he wants to be out on that field sometimes.\n\n\u2018He loves the press conferences as well; I think he\u2019s the same as some older managers, like Sir Alex, as he thinks the battle starts there.\n\n\u2018He gives 100 per cent every single day and has been fantastic for the club since he\u2019s been here.\u2019\n\nSir Alex Ferguson is some way ahead of Klopp in terms of titles (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nLiverpool are unbeaten in the Premier League this season and return to domestic action on Sunday at home to Tottenham after a comfortable 4-1 win over Genk in the Champions League on Wednesday.\n\nThe ever-reliable Milner started that game at right-back and ended it at left-back as he demonstrated his incredible versatility once again.\n\nThe 33-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and is yet to sign a new deal, remaining coy on his future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Who knows, you know?\u2019 Milner said at a press conference ahead of Liverpool\u2019s Champions League clash with Genk.\n\n\u2018There have been talks so hopefully it gets resolved sooner rather than later. But at this moment I will just keep playing football as well as I can.\u2019\n\nMORE: Jurgen Klopp hails \u2018incredibly important\u2019 Fabinho ahead of Liverpool\u2019s clash against Spurs\n\nMORE: What Dejan Lovren told Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain after Champions League wondergoal for Liverpool", "description": "James Milner believes Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is similar to Manchester United legend Sir Alex Ferguson in the way he uses the media to get ahead of opponents.
