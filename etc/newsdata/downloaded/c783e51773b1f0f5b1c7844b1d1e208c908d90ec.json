I worked with them for many years. But we have to get Brexit done and we were being very clear about the risks we\u2019re running now in snarling up the process of leaving the EU in parliament,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd yes of course I am going to reach out to those colleagues and have been reaching out to them, try and find ways of building bridges but I have got to be clear - we must get Brexit done.\u201d", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday he was not willing to contemplate resigning.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
