While conditions in the area were relatively stable of late, Donald Trump withdrew U.S. military forces \u2013 defying the advice of his own administration and failing to consult our allies \u2013 effectively giving the green light to Turkey to launch a brutal offensive against our Kurdish allies. The results have been catastrophic.\n\nOne of Congress\u2019 top Republicans argued yesterday, however, that House Democrats bare at least some of the blame for the crisis conditions.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, claimed Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is partly to blame for Turkey\u2019s invasion of northern Syria. Though Trump has faced bipartisan backlash for withdrawing American troops from the region ahead of the Turkish assault against U.S.-allied Kurdish forces, Cheney said Democrats should also be held responsible for the crisis.\n\nDuring a Fox News appearance, Cheney argued that the ongoing impeachment inquiry is part of an attempt \u201cto weaken this president. The Wyoming Republican added, \u201cIt was not an accident that the Turks chose this moment to roll across the border. And I think the Democrats have got to pay very careful attention to the damage that they\u2019re doing with impeachment proceedings.\u201d\n\nIn other words, by Cheney\u2019s reasoning, Turkey saw an American president weakened by an impeachment inquiry, tried to take advantage of the opportunity, and launched a military assault. If only House Democrats had ignored Trump\u2019s misdeeds, the argument goes, maybe Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would\u2019ve ignored the green light provided by the White House.\n\nAs the HuffPost report added, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office described Cheney\u2019s argument as \u201cdelusional,\u201d which seems more than fair under the circumstances. Indeed, the idea peddled yesterday by the House Republican conference chair is bizarre: Turkey doesn\u2019t care about some congressional hearings; it cares about the withdrawal of American troops. This isn\u2019t complicated.\n\nI can appreciate why some of the White House\u2019s far-right allies would look for ways to shift the blame for Trump\u2019s disastrous decision away from the president, but unless Liz Cheney is prepared to make the case that the House Democratic majority forced Trump to make a ruinous national security decision, the whole argument is plainly ridiculous.\n\nThat said, there is a larger arc to this: some in the GOP want to characterize the impeachment process as inherently dangerous.\n\nLast week, for example, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, argued that impeaching Trump might \u201cdestroy the nation.\u201d This week, Liz Cheney argued that impeachment invites national security crises.\n\nThe idea, evidently, is that it\u2019s in Americans\u2019 interests for Congress to simply look the other way when confronted with evidence of presidential wrongdoing. For at least some of Trump\u2019s Republican allies, accountability isn\u2019t just unwarranted, it\u2019s also hazardous.\n\nWe heard some rhetoric along these lines in the latter half of the Bush/Cheney era, when many on the right insisted that the Republican White House\u2019s critics had a responsibility not to criticize the president, at least not loudly, because any effort that undermined George W. Bush\u2019s standing might encourage terrorists.\n\nThose arguments were absurd at the time. Their rhetorical cousins are no better now.", "description": "For at least some of Trump's Republican allies, accountability isn't just unwarranted, it's also dangerous.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/ap937532439315.jpg?itok=-ZEaXBGv", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
