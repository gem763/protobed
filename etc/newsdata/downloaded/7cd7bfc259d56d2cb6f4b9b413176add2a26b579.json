She was even sent home from hospital after doctors mistook her seizures for sleepwalking.\n\nWhen she had her haemorrhagic stroke, surgeons were forced to operate on her brain and told Nicola that she had just a 50% chance of survival.\n\nWaking up from that operation felt like a blessing, but she was left visually impaired. She also had to battle with the stigma associated with being a young stroke survivor and the ignorance of others.\n\n\u2018It has been difficult and quite shocking at times,\u2019 Nicola tells Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018People are extremely shocked when I say I\u2019ve had a stroke, and I get the usual comments about not knowing it happens to young people. In reality, it can happen to anyone \u2013 including babies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think it comes down to people not grasping that your brain controls everything. So no, reading glasses can\u2019t improve my visual impairment.\n\n\u2018Just today, someone suggested that looking at my phone may have made my vision worse.\u2019\n\nThe physical impact of Nicola\u2019s stroke has significantly changed her life. As well as her sight, she also has problems with memory, energy and emotions.\n\n\u2018I would often forget the name of my baby girl for a long time. When people would approach me and ask, I would have to look to my mum for answers.\n\n\u2018I also often have a really short temper, as I am really tired. Post-stroke fatigue, as it is known, affects all aspects of my life. I am unable to get my words out and tend to repeat myself \u2013 I lose track of where I am in a conversation.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of a stroke? The FAST test helps to spot the three most common symptoms of stroke. But there are other signs that you should always take seriously. These include: Sudden weakness or numbness on one side of the body, including legs, hands or feet.\n\nDifficulty finding words or speaking in clear sentences.\n\nSudden blurred vision or loss of sight in one or both eyes.\n\nSudden memory loss or confusion, and dizziness or a sudden fall.\n\nA sudden, severe headache. If you spot any of these signs of a stroke, don\u2019t wait. Call 999 straight away. Signs of stroke: FAST F ace : Can the person smile? Has their face fallen on one side?\n\n: Can the person smile? Has their face fallen on one side? Arms : Can the person raise both arms and keep them there?\n\n: Can the person raise both arms and keep them there? Speech problems : Can the person speak clearly and understand what you say? Is their speech slurred?\n\n: Can the person speak clearly and understand what you say? Is their speech slurred? Time: If you see any of these three signs, it\u2019s time to call 999. The Stroke Association\n\n\u2018People who have no experience with a brain injury will say things like, \u201coh yeah, I get tired too\u201d, but it\u2019s difficult for them to understand that this is a whole different type of tired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It has an emotional impact, for sure. I sometimes feel bad because my children bear the brunt of my fatigue. In the evening, I have an awful temper and I tend to shout at them, and then get angry at myself and feel guilty. It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\u2019\n\nNicola can no longer read unassisted, and she has to rely on assistive technology to help with her assignments at university.\n\n\u2018I used to enjoy reading; I miss it,\u2019 she tells us.\n\n\u2018My visual impairments used to really get me down \u2013 having to accept that I am now a disabled person is very hard. Asking others for help is extremely difficult, as I always have been quite an independent person.\u2019\n\nNicola says that interactions with others and social situations can be hard, particularly when people lack sensitivity or don\u2019t know how to act around her.\n\n\u2018When you first begin recovery from a brain injury, people tend to avoid you \u2013 they would often ask my mother, \u2018\u2019how is she?\u2019\u2019, with me standing right in front of them,\u2019 says Nicola.\n\n\u2018People have even joked about my poor reading skills, with one former employer calling me \u201cstupid\u201d in front of others, not understanding that my reading issues are because of damage to my brain.\n\n\u2018Comments like this upset me, but also give me more determination.\u2019\n\nNicola is now campaigning for more awareness through the Stroke Association\u2019s Rebuilding Lives campaign. She wants there to be more education around the scope of stroke, who it can happen to, and the effects of brain injury.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018As time goes by, people forget that this will affect me long term \u2013 I\u2019ll always have a brain injury. Just because I walk and talk, does not change the fact that I have a disability,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018It has taken me many years to accept that I am disabled. However, the new me is a nicer, more empathetic person. I may have a brain injury for life and from a younger age than some, but I am on a journey of living with it and learning to cope with it.\u2019\n\nLily was 19 when she had a stroke in her sleep, just days before she was set to receive her A-level results.\n\n\u2018I was born with a hereditary blood disorder which increases the chances of stroke. I have to consider this when I think about having children, I don\u2019t want to pass this gene on to them.\n\nDoctors only discovered that Lily had had a stroke weeks later, and she has been left with problems with her balance and coordination and serious fatigue.\n\n\u2018I felt like screaming \u201cwhy is this happening to me?\u201d\u2018 (Picture: Lily Aldis)\n\n\u2018I felt useless and worthless after my stroke, I didn\u2019t think stroke could happen to young people.\n\n\u2018I felt like screaming \u201cwhy is this happening to me?\u201d These days, I get more headaches than I used to and whenever I do get one, I\u2019m fearful. I worry, \u201cis something more serious going on? Am I having another stroke?\u201d\n\nMore than one million stroke survivors live in fear of having another stroke, and 79% are scared to go out alone, according to research by the Stroke Association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne in five survivors said they kept their fears to themselves and didn\u2019t talk to anyone. This is something Lily can understand.\n\n\u2018I really don\u2019t want my parents or my boyfriend to be as scared as I get either. Sometimes I don\u2019t even tell them if I have a headache \u2013 I just take painkillers in secret.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s weird, I don\u2019t want people to treat me differently due to my stroke but I still want people to know that I am a stroke survivor.\n\n\u2018Even if I haven\u2019t got some of the physical symptoms, life can still be very difficult and scary.\u2019\n\nLily says that having a stroke has turned her life upside down, and the lack of awareness about younger stroke survivors makes it all the more difficult.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve felt like such a burden to my friends as I can\u2019t do what I used to and what a normal 22-year-old would be doing.\n\n\u2018My balance and coordination are all over the place sometimes, which is very frustrating. I used to love playing football, but I can\u2019t even do that anymore.\u2019\n\nStacey woke up on New Year\u2019s Day in 2014 and knew something was seriously wrong. She was just 23 at the time.\n\n\u2018I felt like my face was drooping on one side and that my speech sounded funny to me,\u2019 she explains.\n\n\u2018I woke my then partner, now husband, Philip, and said to him, \u201cget me an ambulance \u2013 I\u2019m having a stroke!\u201d He didn\u2019t believe me and to be honest I started to doubt it too.\n\n\u2018I worry that my children miss out because I\u2019m not the person I was before my stroke\u2019 (Picture: Stacey Hutton)\n\nBut an MRI scan revealed that Stacey had had a stroke, caused by a vertebral artery dissection \u2013 a tear to the lining of the vertebral artery in my neck, which supplies blood to the brain.\n\n\u2018I actually lost the ability to walk, but still had the use of my arms. I remember the day I was asked to try and walk with the aid of a Zimmer frame \u2013 I said: \u201cIf you\u2019re bringing that for me, I am not using it.\u201d\n\n\u2018After some careful negotiation, I agreed to try it but vowed that I would not leave the hospital still using it. And, true to my word, when I got home after nine days on the stroke ward, I had progressed to using crutches.\u2019\n\nFive years down the line and Stacey still battles with fatigue, she walks with the aid of a stick and still has problems with swallowing and short-term memory.\n\n\u2018I am incredibly grateful every day for the help and support of my close family and friends,\u2019 says Stacey.\n\n\u2018One of the hardest things is that I feel that I can\u2019t take my two-year-old to the park on my own. As soon as I let him down he runs and I can\u2019t run after him, which is really tough. I just feel awful that I can\u2019t do the same things with them.\n\n\u2018I worry that my children miss out because I\u2019m not the person I was before my stroke.\u2019\n\nStacey doesn\u2019t really talk about how she feels with her friends and family. She says it can be hard keeping everything to herself.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m aware that my loved ones see me coping and I look OK so they probably think I must be OK. So much of living life after stroke is hidden and every day is different.\n\n\u2018People say to me, \u201cgosh, you\u2019re looking well \u2013 you don\u2019t look like there\u2019s anything wrong with you\u201d. I say, \u201cmakeup covers a lot.\u201d\u2019\n\nStacey now attends support groups and is working to increase awareness about stroke prevention in the local community \u2013 because she remembers how many questions she had when she fell ill.\n\n\u2018Because I was young when I had my stroke, I worried if I would be able to have more children and whether I would be able to get married. I even worried about how I would support myself. Would I be able to work? How would I cope financially?\n\n\u2018I\u2019m passionate about raising awareness that stroke can happen to anyone at any age. We want to give other survivors hope and show that there is life after stroke.\u2019\n\nThe stats from the Stroke Association show that many stroke survivors are facing their recovery alone.\n\nThis leads to a bleak attitude to recovery with 88% of survivors afraid they won\u2019t get better, and four out of five fearing they would get sent to a care home when they first had their stroke.\n\n\u2018When you live in isolation, too afraid to leave the house and are unable to ask for help, your motivation can disappear and can leave you in a very bad place emotionally \u2013 feeling like a prisoner in your own home,\u2019 says Juliet Bouverie, Chief Executive of the Stroke Association.\n\n\u2018It takes a team to rebuild lives after a stroke. When stroke strikes, part of your brain shuts down, and so does a part of you.\n\n\u2018Recovery is tough, but with the right specialist support, the brain can adapt after stroke. I\u2019ve heard countless stories, and know countless people who, after many years continue to make remarkable recoveries.\n\nThe first step to eliminating fear is to ask for help and support. If you are a stroke survivor, this could mean speaking to your doctor or social worker to get some answers. If you know a stroke survivor, reach out, ask them how they\u2019re feeling.\n\n\u2018No one should have to live their lives in constant fear.\u2019\n\nMORE: Natural treatments that can help with seasonal affective disorder\n\nMORE: What are the symptoms of colorectal cancer and what is the screening process?\n\nMORE: Financial security and buying property top the list of things people in their twenties worry about\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A million stroke survivors live in fear of having another stroke - young survivors are now campaigning for better awareness.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1570179149_1570181209.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
