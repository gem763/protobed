Talks between Cisco and Datadog are no longer active and Datadog is committed to going public, they said.\n\nA representative for Cisco declined to comment. Datadog couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.\n\nDatadog this week boosted its IPO price range to $24 to $26 per share from $19 to $22 per share, according to a filing, valuing it at as much $7.5 billion at the top of that range. The IPO is expected to price Wednesday.\n\nSoftware companies that power business processes have delivered some of this year\u2019s best IPO debuts thanks to high margins and solid revenue. Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. have doubled in value since they began trading and are among the ten best performing offerings this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nIn 2017, Cisco succeeded in buying a company on the eve of its IPO. It acquired AppDynamics Inc. for $3.7 billion right before the data analytics company was set to price its listing.\n\n(Adds background on Datadog in penultimate paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Crystal Tse.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Liana Baker in New York at lbaker75@bloomberg.net;Gillian Tan in New York at gtan129@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alan Goldstein at agoldstein5@bloomberg.net, Liana Baker, Matthew Monks\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. approached software company Datadog Inc. in recent weeks with a takeover offer significantly higher than the $7 billion valuation it is aiming for in an initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter.Datadog rebuffed the advance to pursue a stock", "authors": ["Gillian Tan", "Liana Baker", "Ian King"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PGix0DlSOYEBAfoRQYyXXw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/0bb753dc6a8ecec406b2b99e3b149805", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
