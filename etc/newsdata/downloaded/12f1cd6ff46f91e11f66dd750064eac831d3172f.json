Accounting for growth in prosperity (which means more resilience), by 2100 this would drop to 0.01 percent.\n\nAnd the effect of global warming making storms fewer but stronger will see damage end up around 0.02 percent.\n\nNo wonder researchers who study extreme weather and climate change warn that overselling the link risks eroding \u201cscientific credibility\u201d and distracting from the things we need to do to be better prepared for extreme weather.\n\nTo reduce hurricane impacts, our first priority isn\u2019t cutting carbon. Rather, we need to improve building codes.\n\nAnd we should not allow so many houses to be built on vulnerable coastlines. One way to achieve that would be to stop subsidizing home insurance for building houses most likely to get wiped out in hurricanes \u2014 literally a subsidy for building irresponsibly.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bjorn Lomborg", "Nypost.Com What-Aoc-Co-Get-Horribly-Wrong-About-Dorian-And-Climate-Change"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
