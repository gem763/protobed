With 6-month aged sharp cheddar cheese baked into the taco shell, the creation is clearly an attempt to appeal to cheese lovers everywhere.\n\nThe dish will make its nationwide debut on Thursday, the same day the taco chain will officially ax nine menu items, including the Cool Ranch flavored Doritos Locos Taco and the Fiery Locos Taco. The menu revamp is part of an effort to create space for newer items.\n\nTaste test\n\nYahoo Finance put the new Toasted Cheddar Chalupa to a taste test ahead of the launch. Despite sitting in a box for some time while on transit to the studio, the Chalupa still maintained a good crunch.\n\nThere is a distinct cheddar flavor to the Chalupa, but it isn\u2019t overwhelming or overpowering. The lettuce, tomato, and sour cream do a good job balancing out the sharp cheddar and seasoned beef. Yahoo Finance did not taste test the chicken and steak versions. All will sell for $2.49.\n\n\u201cThat was more impressive than I thought it was going to be,\u201d Zack Guzman, host of Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM, said after taking a bite of the Toasted Cheddar Chalupa.\n\nThough it was more impressive than initially anticipated, Guzman admitted that he had a low bar going into the taste test and gave the taco-like chalupa a 3 out of 5 star rating.\n\nFan fave\n\nThe Chalupa first hit Taco Bell menus in 1999 and instantly became a fan favorite. Since then, the chain has launched different variations of the dish, such as the Double Chalupa, Baja Chalupa and the Naked Chicken Chalupa.\n\nAccording to Taco Bell, the Toasted Cheddar Chalupa is the largest international release of a menu item since the Naked Chicken Chalupa in 2017. For a limited time, the cheesy taco will be available in the U.S., Aruba, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama and Puerto Rico.\n\nTaco Bell Toasted Cheddar Chalupa (Courtesy of Taco Bell) More\n\n\u201cAt Taco Bell, we get excited by the \u2018what ifs\u2019 we can dream up and bring to life for our fans \u2014 and the Toasted Cheddar Chalupa is an example of just that,\u201d Taco Bell\u2019s Chief Food Innovation Officer Liz Matthews said in a statement. \u201cWe know cheese makes everything better, and baking aged cheddar into the shell of an already iconic product is a game changer our fans will love.\u201d\n\nTaco Bell is just one of the fast-food chains that is looking to generate buzz and boost traffic through new menu innovations. Recently, Popeyes launched its chicken sandwich, and due to the high demand is officially sold out across the nation until further notice.\n\nTaco Bell continues to be the star of the Yum Brands (YUM) family. The taco chain has seen strong sales momentum, and in its most recent quarter, same-store sales grew at a healthy 7%, eclipsing expectations for 3.8% growth.\n\nShares of Yum Brands have jumped nearly 30% this year, as of Monday\u2019s closing price, while the broader market is up 20% in the same time period.\n\nAMS More\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
