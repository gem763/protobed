General Assembly in New York, Johnson said MPs were losing just a few days of parliamentary time after party conference season.\n\n\u201cWhat are we losing? Four or five days of parliamentary scrutiny, when parliament has had three years to discuss the issue, and they will be able to come back and discuss Brexit after the European Council on October 17 and 18,\u201d he insisted.\n\n\u201cSo 'donnez-moi un break' is my message to those who say there will be no parliamentary scrutiny. It\u2019s absolute nonsense.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court will rule on two cases. One is a government appeal to a case it lost in Scotland\u2019s Court of Session, which was brought by more than 70 parliamentarians headed by Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry.\n\nThe judges in that case wrote that the decision to suspend parliament was \u201cmotivated by the improper purpose of stymying Parliament and that it, and what has followed from it, is unlawful.\u201d\n\nThe other is an appeal by campaigner Gina Miller, backed by former prime ministers John Major and Gordon Brown, after Miller lost her case at the U.K. High Court because it was deemed a political matter.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab has insisted the government will \u201cabide by the ruling\u201d of the Supreme Court.\n\nBut appearing on the BBC Andrew Marr show on Sunday, Raab refused to rule out proroguing parliament again if the government wins the case.", "description": "The Supreme Court will deliver its verdict Tuesday morning.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "James Randerson", "Rym Momtaz", "David M.
