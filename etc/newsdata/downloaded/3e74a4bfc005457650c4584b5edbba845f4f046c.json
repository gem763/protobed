(Picture: ITV)\n\nA boat explosion puts the lives of Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley), Moira Barton (Natalie J Robb) and Nate Robinson (Jurell Carter) at risk in Emmerdale tonight as the tension between the three characters after months of build-up comes to an almighty crescendo.\n\nAfter Pete Barton (Anthony Quinlan) reveals to Cain that it was Nate having an affair with Moira, Cain\u2019s plan for revenge quickly escalates while all three characters are on a fishing trip together.\n\nIn the midst of a physical battle between Nate and Cain, Moira is knocked into the water and, unable to free her leg from some rope, struggles in the water. However, Nate and Cain are also in jeopardy as a fire quickly spreads through the fishing boat leading to an explosion.\n\nWith three Emmerdale characters left for dead tonight, who (if anyone) will survive the horrific explosion?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho is leaving Emmerdale?\n\nAfter Cain took Pete hostage, thinking that he was having an affair with Moira, fans feared the worst for the former barman, especially as it has been confirmed that Anthony Quinlan will be leaving the soap at some stage.\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t seem to be Pete who gets the brunt of Cain\u2019s rage tonight, with Moira and Nate\u2019s lives now hanging in the balance following Cain\u2019s revenge plot, which has also left a question mark as to whether Cain survives the explosion, too.\n\nWe don\u2019t know at this stage if Moira, Nate and Cain survive the boat explosion and none of the actors have revealed if they will be leaving the soap or not.\n\nHowever, one character we do know will be leaving the soap for sure is Faith Dingle, as actress Sally Dexter confirmed that her character will be \u2018collateral\u2019 in the fallout between Moira, Cain and Nate.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nSally exclusively told Metro.co.uk earlier this month: \u2018Well, there\u2019s a lot of fallout from the Moira, Cain, Nate debacle, I am probably going to be collateral.
