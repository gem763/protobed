Talks ran on until midnight on Monday, having entered a so-called \"tunnel\" of intensified negotiations on Friday.\n\nDiplomats say the chief negotiator did not go into extensive detail about discussions with the UK. Talks are focusing on the issue of customs processes across the Irish border, a key sticking point.\n\nBrexit Secretary Steve Barclay, who was also in Luxembourg and who spoke with Mr Barnier at the margins, told reporters: \"The talks are ongoing, we need to give them space to proceed but details conversations are underway and a deal is still very possible.\u201d\n\nIf no deal is struck in time for this week's summit, UK law will force Mr Johnson to delay Brexit yet again, breaking one of his key campaign pledges and opening him up to criticism from Brexiteers. Under the so-called Benn Act, the prime minister must request and accept an extension if no deal is in place by the 19 October \u2013 when MPs will come to Westminster for their emergency Saturday sitting.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney told reporters in Luxembourg:\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to raise expectations about later on today or this evening, but if there is going to be the positive report that is needed to EU capitals tomorrow in advance of the EU summit, then clearly a big step forward is needed today.\n\n\"It is of course possible to move beyond the summit and continue talks next week. That is feasible because the UK isn\u2019t due to leave the EU until the end of the month.\n\n\"From everybody\u2019s perspective, if we could provide clarity at this leaders summit, that would be a welcome development.\"\n\nFor some EU leaders, however, it was already too late to get a deal for the meeting. Speaking on Monday Finnish prime minister and holder of the rotating EU presidency Antti Rinne told reporters: \u201cI think there is no time in a practical or legal way to find an agreement before the EU Council meeting. We need more time.\u201d\n\nEven if agreement will be difficult \u2013 more and more difficult, to be frank \u2013 it is still possible this week. Michel Barnier\n\nSpanish foreign minister Josep Borrell, who is set to take over as the EU\u2019s foreign affairs chief, meanwhile said there might be a need to \u201cstop the watch\u201d and ask for more time.\n\nBoris Johnson spoke about the progress of Brexit negotiations with French president Emmanuel Macron in a 20-minute phone call this morning which Downing Street described as \u201cconstructive\u201d.\n\nThe PM\u2019s official spokesman also confirmed that Mr Johnson met with representatives of the DUP in Number 10 on Monday evening, but declined to go into details of the discussions.\n\nAsked whether the UK recognised Michel Barnier\u2019s midnight deadline for a deal to be agreed, the PM\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister is aware of the time constraints we are under. We want to make progress toward securing as soon as possible and we want to make progress ahead of the European Council on Thursday.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Mr Johnson would accept a technical delay to Brexit to finalise details once a deal had been agreed in outline, the spokesman said: \u201cThe PM has said on many occasions that we need to leave on 31 October.\u201d\n\nHe confirmed that MPs would have to approve the political declaration on future EU/UK relations as well as the withdrawal agreement in order for a deal to be completed. He said that discussions have been taking place on the declaration - which covers issues like the ultimate trading relationship between the UK and EU \u2013 but declined to go into details of Britain\u2019s proposals.\n\nThe regular Tuesday morning meeting of Cabinet was postponed because of ongoing Brexit talks, and is now expected to take place on Wednesday afternoon. Mr Johnson\u2019s spokesman refused to say whether this was expected to be a decision-making meeting.", "description": "Boris Johnson will be left with nothing to take back to MPs on Saturday if he does not meet EU demands by midnight tonight, Michel Barnier has indicated.
