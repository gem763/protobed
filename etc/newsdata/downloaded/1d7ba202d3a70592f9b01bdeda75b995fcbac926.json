It's difficult to win in Australia and to do it so comprehensively was a really proud moment in my coaching career.\n\n\"It was wonderful to watch those young men take on that challenge successfully and have a great time doing it.\n\n\"The win in India in 2012-13 was a highlight too, to overcome some great players in tough spinning conditions was a special victory.\n\n\"So was the T20 World Cup win in 2010. The way we played our cricket, with such freedom and aggression, really was fun to be part of.\"\n\nFlower is planning a spell away from the game.\n\n\"I haven't had a sustained break for quite a long time,\" said the former Zimbabwe Test captain.\n\n__\n\nMore AP cricket: www.apnews.com/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "LONDON (AP) - Former head coach Andy Flower is leaving the England and Wales Cricket Board after 12 years.The 51-year-old Zimbabwean was appointed England...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
