Critically, neither had a clear route to form a majority government.\n\nPost-voting polls have proved unreliable in the past. With both men almost certainly requiring support from smaller parties, minor differences in official results could significantly alter the makeup of Israel\u2019s next government.\n\nNetanyahu has clambered to extend his record-breaking time as prime minister by forging alliances with hardline religious politicians and appealing to far-right ultranationalists.\n\nThe 69-year-old leader is fighting not only for his political life but also his freedom. Pre-trial hearings for three corruption cases against him are just weeks away and a majority in the 120-seat parliament could help grant him immunity from prosecution.\n\nAt times appearing frantic, Netanyahu rushed to rally his supporters on Tuesday with alarmist threats that \u201cleftists\u201d and politicians from the country\u2019s Arab minority were on the brink of toppling him.\n\nAfter casting his ballot in Jerusalem, he toured the city with a megaphone warning the election was extremely tight. \u201cDo you want a leftwing government with the Arab parties?\u201d he threatened. \u201cSo go to vote!\u201d\n\nRunning against him, Gantz has headed a campaign squarely focused on Netanyahu\u2019s divisive politics and personal scandals, presenting himself as a clean and responsible alternative.\n\n\u201cToday, we are voting for change,\u201d the Blue and White party leader said. \u201cWe will succeed in bringing hope, all of us together, without corruption and without extremism.\u201d\n\nTo win support from Israeli rightwingers and settlers, both men have attempted to sell the promise of an expansionist Israel that extends its borders deep into Palestinian territory.\n\nNetanyahu vowed last week to declare up to a third of the occupied West Bank as part of Israel if he was re-elected and Gantz swiftly accused his political opponent of stealing his idea.\n\nOne voter, a 40-year-old venture capitalist, said there were few options for Israelis who were not rightwing. A big factor why he voted for Gantz was to end Netanyahu\u2019s political career. \u201cI think it\u2019s crucial he does not win,\u201d said Boaz, asking only to give his first name.\n\nGantz, he believed, was also more likely to make serious efforts to come to an agreement with the Palestinians. \u201cIf we don\u2019t give it a chance, we have a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cOur moral society has the potential to collapse.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu appeared to narrowly beat Gantz in an April election, but he failed to form a government and so forced a repeat vote to give himself another chance.\n\nAn inconclusive result in which neither party has a clear lead could plunge Israel further into political mayhem, with the prospect of weeks of tense deal-making or even a third election.\n\nPresident Reuven Rivlin, who will pick a candidate he believes has the best chance to form a government, said he would do everything in his power to avoid \u201canother election campaign\u201d.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s attempts in May failed after ally-turned-rival, Avigdor Lieberman, refused to join the coalition government unless the prime minister agreed to reign in Jewish ultra-Orthodox politicians. Lieberman, a staunch secularist, has seen his popularity spike and he could come out of the election as a kingmaker.\n\nScorned by his former right-hand man, Netanyahu unleashed his Likud party\u2019s campaigners on Lieberman\u2019s Russian-speaking base.\n\n\u201cBibi has been meeting Russian people, even trying to speak a little Russian,\u201d said Roman Sokolov, a Likud member in Jerusalem.\n\nAcross the country, political banners have be hung from buildings, bridges and even on the backs of cars.\n\nOn election day, Israel\u2019s military said it had closed all crossings with the West Bank, where more than 2.5 million Palestinians live under Israeli rule but cannot vote, and Gaza, where 2 million more live under a blockade.\n\nInside Israel, Palestinian citizens make up close to a fifth of the 9 million population, although many boycott elections. This year, Arab parties ran under a single alliance in an attempt to raise their joint influence.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t care who wins\u2019: young Gazans see little choice in Israel\u2019s elections Read more\n\nAs in previous elections, Netanyahu has ramped up anti-Arab rhetoric to appeal to the far right. Last week, Facebook temporarily shut down a chatbot on his official page for breaching the company\u2019s hate speech policy after it warned of Arabs who \u201cwant to destroy us all\u201d.\n\nThe Likud party installed dozens of cameras outside Arab polling stations in what was widely seen as an attempt to intimidate members of the minority from not voting.\n\nSpeaking at a polling station in Jaffa, Abed Abu Shhadeh said he believed Netanyahu\u2019s scaremongering might have backfired. \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s political discourse gave Arabs a sense of importance \u2013 that their vote does matter,\u201d said the 31-year-old, an Arab city councillor for Tel Aviv-Jaffa, where there is a substantial Palestinian population.\n\nNearby, Lisa, also a Palestinian citizen of Israel, said she would vote for the Arab alliance. \u201cIt\u2019s the only party that shakes the status quo,\u201d she said, complaining the country had become \u201crightwing and fascist\u201d after passing a law last year that declared that only Jews had the right of self-determination in the country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this state to be a Jewish state,\u201d said the 31-year-old, who asked to only give her first name. \u201cIt\u2019s a democracy for Jews and a sort of dictatorship for Arabs.\u201d", "description": "Prime minister\u2019s ruling Likud party trailing Blue and White party, poll shows", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eb5c67617771a51910d9a55489aa471835e0bfe/0_229_4389_2633/master/4389.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e1178c8e7d96e88fefa460049b8be791", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
