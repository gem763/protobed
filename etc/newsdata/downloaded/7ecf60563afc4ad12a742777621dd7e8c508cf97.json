The IPCC also lacks the legal power to summon witnesses.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Most of the protesters, particularly the radical fringe, consist of university and high school students and this group has made it known they have no interest in speaking to Carrie Lam.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf she had made the announcement [of the bill\u2019s withdrawal] say two months ago, it would have helped to appease the public, but now the goalposts have moved, and the public is demanding some concrete, democratic development.\u201d\n\nConservative politician Michael Tien said that the bill\u2019s withdrawal \u201cmay not be able to put the unrest away, to a level under control.\u201d He told TIME: \u201cI think they need to think about the issue of the Commission of Inquiry. In the last two months, things have taken a turn. The priority of the Commission of Inquiry is higher.\u201d\n\nDemocratic legislator Au Nok-hin agreed. \u201cI think an independent investigative body [into the police] and the nomination of a neutral person to chair such a committee would be crucial \u2026 If the police can\u2019t be trusted, it will be very difficult for them to execute the law in the future.\u201d\n\nThe bill that sparked the Hong Kong protests would have allowed, for the first time, the extradition of fugitives to mainland China. Critics of the measure feared that Beijing would use its provisions to round up dissidents in the semi-autonomous territory, which was retroceded to China in 1997 after 156 years as a British colony. Opposition to the bill quickly escalated into a campaign for full political freedom for Hong Kong, whose 7.2 million inhabitants are linguistically and culturally distinct from mainland Chinese.\n\nLam\u2019s withdrawal of the bill yesterday was intended as a major concession to the movement, but has instead provoked anger and scorn\u2014uniting activists, academics and even pro-government politicians in agreement that it was insufficient.\n\n\u201cShe finally bowed to demands by saying that she has irrevocably withdrawn the bill,\u201d Professor Lam said, \u201cbut it was a case of too little, too late.\u201d\n\nThe chief executive\u2019s close aide and cabinet member, Ronny Tong, has been one of her few defenders.\n\n\u201cBehind the current immediate problems lie the more deep-seated discord in the community, and that discord has got to be dealt with by livelihood issues,\u201d he told TIME. \u201cCarrie Lam is a good administrator in relation to solving such deep-seated livelihood issues, and in these first two years she\u2019s dealt with them in ways that people tend to agree with.\u201d\n\nPro-establishment politician Regina Ip also sounded a positive note.\n\n\u201cWe do not expect one concession to placate all the protestors,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at least this move demonstrates that the government has been listening.\u201d\n\nBut pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo summed up the fury of many in Hong Kong, when she told TIME that Hong Kong\u2019s beleaguered leader was \u201can incurable tinpot dictator, using rule by law, rule by decree to clamp down on our young protesters.\u201d\n\nThe atmosphere in the enclave remains tense. Hongkongers woke Thursday morning to the news that the home of pro-democracy tycoon Jimmy Lai had been attacked with petrol bombs, and that Chinese president Xi Jinping had singled out Hong Kong, the neighboring territory of Macau, and the self-governing island of Taiwan (which China considers a renegade province) as major risks that the Communist Party must \u201cstruggle against.\u201d\n\nHardline activists in Hong Kong have also vowed to escalate their campaign if their demands are not met by Sept. 13.\n\n\u2014With reporting by Amy Gunia and Hillary Leung / Hong Kong\n\n\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Carrie Lam has defended her approach to ending Hong Kong's unrest, despite the poor reception shown to the overtures yesterday.", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/gettyimages-1166022344.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
