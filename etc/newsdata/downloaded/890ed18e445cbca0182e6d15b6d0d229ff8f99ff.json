REUTERS/Umit Bektas?\n\nPro-democracy activists have attacked police with petrol bombs, rocks and lasers shone in their eyes, furious at social media footage of random beatings, especially one against protesters cowering on the floor of a subway train.\n\nOne officer this month was slashed in the neck with a knife.\n\nPolice have responded to the violence with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds, wounding several.\n\nProtesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which Britain returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of inciting the unrest.\n\nThe police and justice secretary applied for a ban on disclosing names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers and other details, including children\u2019s school addresses.\n\nThe court agreed to an injunction, including a broad ban on \u201charassing\u201d and \u201cpestering\u201d, which media said would last until Nov. 8.\n\nProfessor Simon Young, of the University of Hong Kong\u2019s law school, told Reuters that the move effectively amounted to a law targeting a select group - a serious move which should be dealt with through new legislation, not an injunction.\n\n\u201cIt opens a whole new can of worms and questions about enforcement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt reflects the dysfunction of the legislative process that injunctions are being used in this way.\u201d\n\nHong Kong-based lawyer and author Antony Dapiran said the injunction was a \u201cvery alarming development\u201d.\n\n\u201cSerious restriction on freedom of expression effectively criminalises a whole range of perfectly lawful acts which will now be punishable as contempt of court,\u201d Dapiran wrote on Twitter.\n\nDOXXING\n\nPolice said in August more than 1,600 officers and their family members had been victimised by doxxing - the publication of private information online.\n\n\u201cThey also suffered all sorts of harassment, including nuisance calls, verbal intimidation and even death threats,\u201d Police Public Relations Branch Chief Superintendent Tse Chun-chung said at the time. \u201cSome people misused our officers\u2019 personal data to apply for loans.\u201d\n\nThe rallying cry of the protest movement is \u201cfive demands, not one less\u201d, including universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality, which leader Carrie Lam has refused to grant.\n\nHong Kong is now in its fifth month of protests, which have plunged it into its biggest political crisis in decades and taken a heavy toll on the economy.\n\nA rally dubbed \u201cMedical Workers Resisting Tyranny\u201d is planned at Chater Garden in the heart of the financial centre on Saturday, with another protest, \u201cFight Against Police Brutality, Stand with Muslims, Citizens and Journalists\u201d, due on Sunday across the harbour in Kowloon district.\n\nA police water cannon truck shot bursts of blue-dyed water at a small clutch of people on the footpath outside a mosque during protests in Kowloon on Sunday, hitting its gate and steps, drawing criticism from some in the Muslim community.\n\nPolice said the incident was \u201cmost unfortunate\u201d and unintended, while senior officers met Muslim leaders to offer apologies.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused China on Thursday of curtailing \u201crights and liberties\u201d in Hong Kong and blasted U.S. company Nike (NKE.N) and the National Basketball Association for falling in line with Beijing in a disagreement over free speech.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying denounced Pence\u2019s comments and said the United States should reflect on its own domestic issues, like gun violence.", "description": "Hong Kong's High Court on Friday banned people from disclosing personal information about the police and their families, widely targeted in protests that have gripped the Chinese-ruled city for months, prompting concern among legal experts.", "authors": ["Twinnie Siu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444715213&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O05K", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
