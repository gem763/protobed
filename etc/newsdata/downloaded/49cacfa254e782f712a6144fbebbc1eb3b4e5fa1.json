Rightly heralded as the world's best players for the past decade, the duo will once again go head to head this year.\n\nNeymar is yet to release any form of personal response following his snub from the decorated list of names.", "description": "There was a shock when he was left off the list of nominees for the individual player award on Monday night, which was the first time that has occurred after eight straight years of being included.", "authors": ["Amitai Winehouse For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20028984-0-image-a-2_1571737555052.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
