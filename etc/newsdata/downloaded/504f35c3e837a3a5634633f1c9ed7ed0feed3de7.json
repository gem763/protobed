How can Thursday 19 September 2019 not be the work of a dedicated writing team?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHow can the narrative of this day not have been plotted out?\n\nHow can someone somewhere not have said: \u201cOkay, I like the former Tory prime minister taking the current one to the Supreme Court storyline, but here\u2019s an idea. On the actual day it happens, why don\u2019t we make that the day we finally bring Cameron back out of the shepherd\u2019s hut, after three whole years?\n\n\u201cJust imagine. We can have Cameron on the radio \u2013 and sod it, let\u2019s make it Humphrys\u2019 last day as well shall we \u2013 flogging his book. We can flashback to season one, you know, the whole, \u2018I will settle the Europe question forever with an in/out referendum\u2019 stuff.\n\n\u201cAnd then, wallop. We\u2019re in the Supreme Court, John Major\u2019s sitting there, while his legal counsel just slowly, gently explains how Boris Johnson is a \u2018dodgy estate agent\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe can explain how, you know, this idea that the prime minister proroguing parliament is none of the court\u2019s business is daft. He can explain, after two days of indecipherable legalese (not our finest hour by the way, guys), that if this is none of the court\u2019s business, then what\u2019s to stop a prime minister shutting down parliament to prevent him disbanding the armed forces, or shutting down parliament to stop it kicking him out?\n\n\u201cOr, you know, in this actual case, what\u2019s to stop a prime minister shutting down parliament to stop him inflicting actual food and medicine shortages on his own people?\n\n\u201cIf the courts won\u2019t get involved in that, then what can they?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good. Right, and while this is happening, what\u2019s Boris Johnson going to be doing?\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

The constant lying and the humiliating himself absolutely everywhere he goes is playing well with audiences, but there is a real risk we\u2019re pushing it too far.\n\n\u201cAt the moment we\u2019ve got him down for some stuff with the army, but we\u2019re not quite sure where to go with it? We already sent him to a hospital, and had him point directly at the press and say \u2018there are no press here\u2019. Where can you go after that? Apparently ITV viewers have been complaining that the new Dynamo is rubbish.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright we\u2019ll come back to that. What else have you got?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you remember we had him go to Berlin and have Angela Merkel give him a 30-day deadline to come up with \u201cworkable alternatives\u201d to the backstop? Well those 30 days are up today, and he still hasn\u2019t sent anything.\n\n\u201cSo this is what we\u2019ve come up with. We\u2019re going to have them send some \u2018technical non-papers\u2019 to the EU about it. I know \u2018non-papers\u2019 sounds a bit metaphysical but I don\u2019t think we need to worry about that. It\u2019s not like it\u2019ll be the first bit of properly weird gear we\u2019ve nicked from Black Mirror and no one seems to mind.\n\n\u201cAnyway, we\u2019re going to have him try and claim that these \u2018technical non-papers\u2019 are both \u2018strictly confidential\u2019 and also \u2018do not represent the government\u2019s view\u2019. We\u2019re literally going to put that out, as a No 10 statement.\n\n\u201cThis really is going to be his position. We\u2019ve had 30 days to think about it. And here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got, some \u2018non-papers\u2019, that are both top secret and not what we actually think.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncredible. Absolutely incredible. What about tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got. The government\u2019s going to lose the Supreme Court case, parliament\u2019s going to have to be recalled, but it\u2019ll be the middle of the Labour conference by then so all of the MPs who made such a fuss about it will actually have won, but they won\u2019t even come back. And, even if they did, there\u2019ll be absolutely nothing for them to do.\n\n\u201cSo after victory in the biggest court case there\u2019s ever been, we\u2019ll be sending the MPs home from work at about half past three.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh come on. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. No one\u2019s going to believe that. We\u2019re going to have to rein it in a bit. How are we meant to have a series finale after all this?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, here\u2019s the thing. It doesn\u2019t matter. There isn\u2019t going to be one. Not for at least 10 years anyway. This is thing with the Brexit box set. It\u2019s never, ever, ever going to end.\u201d", "description": "For some years now, I have complained that Brexit has reduced the role of the satirist to that of transcriber.
