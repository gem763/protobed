They will be talking to their counterparts,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said of Mr. Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in comments to Sky News. \u201cWhen Trump comes here, I\u2019ll be talking.\u201d\n\nThe vice president\u2019s office said Mr. Pence would leave Washington as scheduled Wednesday to lead a U.S. delegation that includes Mr. Pompeo, White House National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien and the special representative for Syria, James Jeffrey. They want to persuade Mr. Erdogan to halt his military offensive across the border in northeast Syria, which began last week. Mr. Pence had been expected to meet with Mr. Erdogan on Thursday.\n\nMr. Erdogan said he would not agree to a cease-fire. He said Turkey will end its offensive in Syria when it finishes creating a \u201csafe zone\u201d from the city of Manbij to the border with Iraq.\n\n\u201cWe will never declare a cease-fire,\u201d Mr. Erdogan told reporters Tuesday. \u201cThey are pressuring us to stop the operation. They are announcing sanctions. Our goal is clear. We are not worried about any sanctions.\u201d\n\nMr. Erdogan also said he will decide after his government\u2019s meetings with the U.S. delegation whether he will visit the White House next month.\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
