(AP) - Before he joined Santa Fe Public Schools, Gary Bass taught English in China, Syria and Vietnam. His students at El Camino Real Academy are aware of his world travels and prone to inquiring about motorbike traffic in Asia or the sounds of a foreign language.\n\n\u201cIf they ask me to say something in Chinese, they laugh the way people laugh at things they don\u2019t understand,\u201d Bass said. \u201cThey don\u2019t get it that people on the other side of the world are thinking the same thing when they hear their language, that we\u2019re all just people trying to get by.\u201d\n\nNext month, Bass will take a one-month leave from his classroom to train English teachers at a K-12 school in Kampot, Cambodia, thanks to a scholarship from the Fulbright Program, an international educational exchange program sponsored by the U.S. State Department. Beyond helping Cambodian teachers explain the intricacies of English tenses or subject-verb agreement, Bass said he hopes the experience helps him broaden the world view of his students back home in New Mexico.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping to alleviate some of my own students\u2019 stereotypes about people from that side of the world,\u201d Bass said. \u201cThe world needs people speaking more languages and trying to understand each other better. This is a good chance for me to help that come along a little bit.\u201d\n\nBass said he submitted an application for the Fulbright scholarship in May that included professional references and a few personal essays. He learned he\u2019d been selected in July.\n\nAt El Camino Real, a K-8 school of 316 students, Bass speaks both English and Spanish to teach digital literacy classes in which kindergartners learn to click a mouse and middle schoolers write code for video games. The school\u2019s bilingual program begins in kindergarten, with 80 percent of the instruction in Spanish. By third grade, class time is split evenly between Spanish language and English language lessons. In middle school, math, science and language arts classes alternate each quarter between Spanish and English.\n\nBass and his students agree the dual-language model improves students\u2019 grasp of both languages.\n\n\u201cWhen we learn in both languages, it\u2019s challenging, especially for people who only know a little Spanish or a little English,\u201d El Camino Real seventh-grader Jonathan Alvarez said in Spanish. \u201cBut when you\u2019re learning new things in Spanish, you\u2019re learning new things in English, too. If you learn a new word in Spanish, you can now learn it in English, too.\u201d\n\nBass said he is already introducing his students to the sights of Kampot, such as a traffic circle built around a giant statue of a durian - a thorny fruit native to the region that is famous for its putrid smell. There also are cultural details to impart, like the small wooden spirit houses outside businesses and homes filled with cigarettes, whiskey and other worldly goods meant to appease spirits.\n\nBass\u2018 desk at El Camino Real has flashcards for words in Khmer, Cambodia\u2019s primary language.\n\nBass\u2018 Fulbright assignment is to train English teachers to better understand and implement their curriculum, which he said comes from an American textbook. His larger goal is to establish a pen pal system, video conferences and other cultural exchanges between the school in Cambodia and his classroom in Santa Fe.\n\nBefore he leaves at the end of October, Bass is trying to think of what pieces of New Mexico to bring with him to share with his new colleagues and students.\n\n\u201cI would love to take green chile, but I don\u2019t know how to transport that,\u201d Bass said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to think of what type of gift could represent New Mexico.\u201d\n\nBilingualism seems like it will do.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Before he joined Santa Fe Public Schools, Gary Bass taught English in China, Syria and Vietnam.
