I will be announcing the new Acting Secretary next week. Many wonderful candidates! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2019\n\nI want to thank the President for the opportunity to serve alongside the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security. With his support, over the last 6 months, we have made tremendous progress mitigating the border security and humanitarian crisis we faced this year... pic.twitter.com/A4rTcZgJKF \u2014 Acting Sec. Kevin McAleenan (@DHSMcAleenan) October 12, 2019\n\nMcAleenan made headlines earlier this week, when his attempt to speak at a conference about immigration was prevented by angry protesters at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. It is unclear whether that incident had anything to do with the resignation, however, as CNN reported \u2013 citing anonymous sources \u2013 that it has been in the works for several weeks.\n\nAlso on rt.com Overwhelmed immigration facilities already have \u2018egregious\u2019 safety violations \u2013 DHS\n\nFormerly head of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), McAleenan stepped into the DHS job in April, after the surprise resignation of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. He quickly found himself hounded by the media and Democrats, both opposed to Trump\u2019s policies on immigration and securing the southern US border.\n\nIn an interview with the Washington Post, published on October 1, he complained that he does not control \u201cthe tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time,\u201d describing that as \u201cuncomfortable\u201d situation for the acting department chief. Trump had not nominated him to the post permanently, either.\n\nAlso on rt.com Homeland Security fuses all biometric data on an Amazon server - what could go wrong?\n\nIt was unclear whether McAleenan\u2019s departure was effective immediately. While Trump said he would be nominating a new acting secretary next week, from \u201cmany wonderful candidates,\u201d the position would normally pass to the current acting Deputy Secretary, David Pekoske \u2013 a retired US Coast Guard vice-admiral who currently serves as head of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).\n\nHomeland Security has been the cabinet post with the highest turnover in the Trump administration at this point. Nielsen had replaced her former boss, retired General John Kelly, who was confirmed by the Senate to the post in January 2017, but left in August to become the White House chief of staff.\n\nDETAILS TO FOLLOW", "description": "Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has resigned from the post, just days after his speech at Georgetown University was shouted down by protesters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da115f785f540083d6cdf5f.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
