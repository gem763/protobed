At present, there are around 23,000 jets globally.\n\nThe firm said while fewer planes will be required, more will need to be sold as airlines update fleets with more fuel-efficient models. Airbus breaks down the 2038 total to 39,210 new planes and 8,470 remaining from today. Seems to be 9 left over\n\nThe outlook also forecast that around two-thirds of new plane deliveries will be needed to satisfy a doubling of passenger traffic over the next 15 years. The remainder (36%) will be sold to replace current jets.\n\nAirbus sees single-aisle jet demand rising 4% to 29,720 planes, but cut its medium-sized plane forecast to 5,370.\n\nWithin its large plane segment, Airbus predicts 4,120 new planes sold but no longer includes a separate forecast for Boeing's ageing 747 or the recently halted Airbus A380.\n\nThe Airbus projection offered no dollar value for the new business. On Tuesday, rival Boeing released its commercial outlook projecting $6.8 trillion worth of airplane sales by 2038 with a further $9.1 trillion in services.", "description": "While more new planes are needed, Airbus predicts that overall there will be slightly fewer planes in the sky in 2038 than previously thought.", "authors": ["David Reid"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106135834-1568802636146gettyimages-1169018653.jpeg?v=1568802685", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
