The firm also noted that the total lost profit has cost each GM worker as much as $4,000 in net take home pay.\n\nNegotiations are continuing between UAW leaders and GM. The union summoned local leaders to Detroit to meet this coming Thursday, for an update on the negotiations. The union has traditionally done this when a tentative agreement has been reached or, as was the case a month ago, to discuss and vote on other actions such as a strike.\n\n-- CNBC's Michael Bloom and Michael Wayland contributed to this report.", "description": "The strike by General Motors workers has cost about $2 billion in lost profit through the first four weeks, Bank of America estimated.", "authors": ["Michael Sheetz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106150803-1569513411855img_5217.jpg?v=1569933723", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
