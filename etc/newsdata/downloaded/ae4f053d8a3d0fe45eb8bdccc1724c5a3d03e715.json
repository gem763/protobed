In case the point wasn\u2019t clear, he added, \u201cI\u2019ve been on more picket lines, I expect, than all my opponents combined over the last 30 years.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe impassioned comments, in an early nominating state that his advisers believe is crucial to his chances, represent a shift since his health scare. After taking two weeks away from the trail to recover, Sanders has resumed his busy schedule with a four-day swing through three states, concluding Sunday in Michigan.\n\nWhile his remarks have often been in line with his earlier focus on such issues as income inequality and the need for universal health care, the greater attention to his age is a notable turn for a candidate who typically does not like to talk about himself and an attempt to create an implicit contrast with rivals who came to left-leaning ideas more recently.\n\n\u201cHaving a long record gives people the understanding that these ideas that I am talking about \u2014 they are in my guts. They are in my heart,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cThis is who I am as a human being, and it ain\u2019t gonna change.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSanders\u2019s aides played down the notion that his words amount to a concerted new strategy, saying they have personally heard him say similar things in the past. But publicly, the candidate is emphasizing his age in a new way, a message that appeared to play well with his crowds.\n\nIt is unclear whether Sanders will continue addressing his age so frankly. At the outset of his campaign, he spoke more frequently about his personal story on the advice of aides, but those lines soon disappeared from his speeches.\n\nSanders is now at third place in most polls, behind former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Biden, 76, and Warren, 70, have also faced questions about their age, but the subject is showing signs of becoming a larger concern for Sanders, especially since his heart attack.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nForty-three percent of Democrats in early battleground states said Sanders was too old to serve effectively as president, according to an October CBS News/YouGov poll, up from 37 percent in September. Twenty-eight percent said the same of Biden and just 4 percent of Warren.\n\nSanders is not the first presidential candidate forced to deflect questions about his age. In the 2008 campaign, Republican John McCain, then 71, would sometimes say, \u201cI\u2019m older than dirt and have more scars than Frankenstein, but I\u2019ve learned a few things along the way.\u201d\n\nIn 1984, GOP President Ronald Reagan, seeking re-election at 73, was asked about his age during a debate with Democrat Walter Mondale, 56. Reagan joked that \u201cI am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEven before Sanders\u2019s heart attack, a core part of his strategy was to emphasize that he is the candidate who could be most trusted to deliver a sweeping liberal agenda. He frequently points out, as he did Thursday in Marshalltown, Iowa, that he has been championing ideas such as single-payer health care long before they were in vogue in the Democratic Party.\n\nAD\n\nNow Sanders is using the heightened focus on his age to underline that pitch.\n\n\u201cI do not go around this country disparaging other Democratic candidates,\u201d Sanders said Thursday. But he added, \u201cWhat distinguishes my candidacy from the others is I have been fighting for the working families of this country for many, many decades.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDuring his current swing through Iowa, Sanders has also spoken directly, if briefly, about his heart attack. One man told the senator at Thursday\u2019s town hall that he had suffered multiple heart attacks, adding that heart conditions can be overcome.\n\n\u201cI learned more about cardiology in the last couple weeks than I knew much about in my life,\u201d Sanders responded. \u201cIt turns out about a million people per year have the procedure that you and I had.\u201d\n\nStill, Sanders has yet to provide details about how much damage his heart sustained. His campaign has vowed to release his health records before the end of the year.\n\nAD\n\nSanders\u2019s allies are also hopeful that recent high-profile endorsements from a pair of young, liberal congresswomen will infuse his campaign with a more youthful image. Sanders plans to hold a rally with another potential endorser, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), in Detroit on Sunday and a similar event with Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) in Minneapolis early next month. Omar endorsed Sanders last week; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was the other to do so.\n\nAD\n\nMany of the voters showing up to support him appear to be accepting his new message. \u201cWisdom comes with age \u2014 you don\u2019t start out that smart,\u201d said Raymond Langloss, 57, who wore a \u201cBernie beats Trump\u201d button to the Marshalltown town hall.\n\nThe bigger question for Sanders is whether he can win undecided voters such as Mary Stevens, 70, who said she is choosing among six Democratic candidates. \u201cThis is a very strenuous activity. He\u2019s 78 years old,\u201d said Stevens, who also attended the town hall. She added, \u201cHe took care of himself. He obviously is in good shape.\u201d\n\nEven before his heart attack, Sanders often answered questions about his age by saying it was only one of many factors voters should consider. He reprised that on Friday, saying there are many candidates who are young and vigorous but embrace bad policies.\n\n\u201cThis is not a beauty contest,\u201d Sanders said, adding jokingly, \u201cwhich obviously I would win.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Since Sanders returned to the campaign trail after a heart attack, questions about his age and health have intensified.
