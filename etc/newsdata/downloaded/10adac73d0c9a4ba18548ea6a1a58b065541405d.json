His first stream is today at 8pm ET. He jokes in the announcement video that he\u2019s \u201cmaking moves,\u201d following in the same footsteps as another popular streamer, Ninja.\n\nTyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins left his home on Twitch in August to stream exclusively on Mixer earlier this year, and shook the streaming industry to its core. Both Grzesiek and Blevins are two of the gaming world\u2019s most watched streamers, and both came up through Twitch after retiring from professional play. (Ninja was a former Halo pro before transitioning to battle royale games.) Blevins commented on Grzesiek\u2019s move on Twitter, calling it a \u201cmassive move for the platform and the streaming industry.\u201d\n\nIt may come as a surprising move to fans, especially since Grzesiek saw Blevins\u2019 departure as a chance for him to grow his own brand on Twitch. \u201cHey man, Ninja\u2019s gone,\u201d he said during a stream in August, just after the announcement was made. \u201cIt\u2019s all me, baby. Gotta take advantage.\u201d\n\nStill, his move is proof that Twitch\u2019s top talent isn\u2019t as tied to the streaming service as people may have expected before. Whether it\u2019s due to financial deals \u2014 reports suggested that Blevins signed an impressive contract with Microsoft to stream exclusively on Mixer \u2014 or growing concern over burnout and lingering issues on Twitch, streamers are looking elsewhere.\n\nNinja\u2019s manager and wife, Jessica Blevins, told Business Insider earlier this year that he decided to leave Twitch because of the company\u2019s inability to work with them on building out the \u201cNinja\u201d brand.\n\n\u201cMoney was the last thing on our mind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, they don\u2019t even know what went on behind the scenes and how hard we tried to make that deal work \u2014 and then how amazing Microsoft was for us.\u201d\n\nMixer is growing in popularity, but it\u2019s still far from competing on a level field with Twitch. New data, released by StreamElements in partnership with streaming analytics site Arsenal.gg, found that hours watched on Mixer jumped about 3 million in August, just after Blevins joined the platform. In that same time period, Twitch jumped from 850.6 million to 932.1 million, according to StreamElements\u2019 data.", "description": "Michael \"Shroud\" Grzesiek is the latest Twitch megastar to abandon the Amazon-owned streaming service in favor of Microsoft\u2019s Mixer platform.
