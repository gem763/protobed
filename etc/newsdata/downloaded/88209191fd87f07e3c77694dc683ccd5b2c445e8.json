This is a matter for the court to decide. It's important to note the dramatisations made in Sonni's declaration are a one-sided account made with a specific goal in mind.\"\n\nMirror Online has contacted Jeremy's representatives for comment.", "description": "The Avengers star is alleged to have been using alcohol and cocaine when he began talking about killing his ex-wife Sonni", "authors": ["Vicki Newman", "Image", "Getty", "Wireimage", "Gc Images", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578817.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Marvel-Avengers-Assemble-European-Premiere-Outside-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
