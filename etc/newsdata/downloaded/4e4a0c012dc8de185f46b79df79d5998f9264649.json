EIA/S\n\nU.S. crude stocks fell 7.2 million barrels last week, more than analysts' expectations for 2.7 million-barrel draw, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed. Official figures will be released on Wednesday.\n\nTrump abruptly fired Bolton amid disagreements over how to handle foreign policy challenges such as North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan and Russia. market took that as a sign that the Trump administration may become less hawkish on Iran, open the talks and the possibility of the return of Iranian oil,\" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.\n\nIran's crude oil exports were slashed by more than 80% due to re-imposed sanctions by the United States after Trump exited last year Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. In May, Washington ended sanction waivers given to importers of Iranian oil, aiming to cut Tehran's exports to zero. market was further pressured by the U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) lowering of its spot crude oil price forecasts, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.\n\nIn its latest monthly Short Term Energy Outlook, the EIA reduced its forecast for spot West Texas Intermediate crude prices for 2019 to an average of $56.31 per barrel from $57.87 in its August report.\n\nThe EIA also reduced its forecast for spot Brent prices for 2019 to an average of $63.39 per barrel from $65.15.\n\nOil prices were higher earlier in the session after Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's new energy minister and a longtime member of the Saudi delegation to OPEC and its allies, said the kingdom's policy would not change and a global deal to cut oil production by 1.2 million barrels per day would be maintained. added that the so-called OPEC+ alliance, which includes non-OPEC producers such as Russia, would be in place for the long term.\n\nThe OPEC+ joint ministerial monitoring committee (JMMC), which reports on compliance with the cuts, is due to meet on Thursday in Abu Dhabi.\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE: ) lowered its forecast on 2019 oil demand growth to 1 million bpd, down 100,000 bpd, but left its 2020 demand growth estimate broadly unchanged at 1.4 million bpd. oil supply-demand outlook for 2020 calls for additional OPEC production cuts to keep inventories near normal,\" Goldman analysts wrote in a note.\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2y7mC9g CHART: U.S. oil may extend gains to $59.75\n\nL3N2610NS CHART: Brent oil may rise to $64.57\n\nL3N26104Q\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "UPDATE 9-Oil falls on possibility of Iran exports resuming after Trump fires hard-line adviser", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA5T0D5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
