Ahora es tiempo de que trabajemos entre todos para construir la Argentina que so\u00f1amos. Una Argentina para todos. Una Argentina de pie. \ud83c\uddf7 pic.twitter.com/NNnve2wu7K \u2014 Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez (@alferdez) October 27, 2019\n\nThe result is a considerable setback for the anti-socialist wave that has swept through Latin America over the past decade, following the ousting of left-wing governments in Chile, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Paraguay.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez had been the strong favorite since winning a landslide victory during August\u2019s primary elections and later extended his lead in pre-election opinion polls. He pledged to restore the country\u2019s economic standing by increasing spending and renegotiating $100 billion in sovereign debt left by his predecessor that may eventually lead to a damaging default.\n\nSupporters of Macri argue that his pro-market policies would require some diminishing of the size of the government and its aid to the public and that he inherited an unstable economy following 12 years of socialist governance. The vice president-elect preceded Macri in the office of the presidency.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez\u2019s victory also marks a return for former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who a judge ordered the arrest of in 2017 on charges of treason over claims she covered up the involvement of the Iranian regime in the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) \u2014 an attack which killed 85 people and injured hundreds more \u2014 in exchange for favorable trade deals.\n\nIn 2015, federal prosecutor Alberto Nisman was preparing an indictment against various Iranian officials over their role in the attack, which was carried out by the regime\u2019s terror proxy. He was found dead a day before a congressional hearing where he intended to present his accusations. Kirchner\u2019s government ruled his death a suicide, although critics believe he was the victim of a conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nThe 66-year-old, who led Argentina from 2007 to 2015 following the death of her husband N\u00e9stor, also faced allegations of embezzling government funds intended for infrastructure projects. However, she had her case suspended earlier this year, allowing her to run for office once again.\n\nIn a clear sign of his future foreign policy, the new president sent a message to former Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula Da Silva, who has been serving a 12-year-old prison sentence since last year for taking bribes from government contractors and using them to buy a luxury beachfront property. His imprisonment paved the way for conservative firebrand Jair Bolsonaro to sweep to victory in last year\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\u201cToday also marks the birthday of Lula Da Silva, an extraordinary man who has been unjustly imprisoned for the past year and a half. Congratulations do you, dear Lula. I hope to see you soon,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez wrote on Twitter Sunday.\n\nTambi\u00e9n hoy cumple a\u00f1os mi amigo @LulaOficial, un hombre extraordinario que est\u00e1 injustamente preso desde hace un a\u00f1o y medio. Parab\u00e9ns pra voc\u00ea, querido Lula.
