But still. A friggin\u2019 frock may have enjoyed more luxury than most gowns can dream of.\n\nWeekend rates at the Hotel Viking started at around $350 per night on travel sites Tuesday morning. Perhaps the Oscar-winning actress got a deal for last weekend? Or maybe the dress did its own research.\n\n\u201cThe Dior design team flew in directly from Paris the day before J.Law tied the knot, and the gown had a private guest room booked for safekeeping at Newport\u2019s historic Hotel Viking for the evening,\u201d a source told Page Six.\n\nThe Dior team then loaded the dress into a car the next morning, perhaps the same source told People.\n\nThe \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d star and Maroney, an art gallery director, exchanged their vows at a mansion in Newport in front of guests that included Amy Schumer, Adele and Emma Stone.\n\nAnd the dress.", "description": "The Dior creation had all the privacy it needed, according to reports.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daedcfe210000ba1e34aab6.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
