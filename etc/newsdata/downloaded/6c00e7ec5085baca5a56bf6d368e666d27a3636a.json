Yet that initiative also represents an effort, badly executed and communicated, to bring about a paradigm shift in America's war on terror.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is trying to usher in a fourth phase of that post-9/11 conflict, in which the U.S. would accept greater security risk as the price of reducing the ongoing costs of involvement in the greater Middle East. He is running head-on into opposition from many in his own party, who are still more inclined to pay higher costs to buy down the threat of terrorist attacks. Trump is so far getting the worst of the debate. But the underlying issue he has raised is not going away anytime soon.\n\nSince the Sept. 11 attacks, the U.S. struggle against terrorism has gone through three phases. The first phase was the \"anywhere, anytime\" approach taken by the George W. Bush administration in the years following 9/11. The U.S. mounted large-scale invasions and long-term nation-building projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. The possibility of devastating follow-on attacks seemed unacceptably high, so U.S. officials were willing to pay quite a price to suppress terrorist groups, defeat state sponsors, and attempt to transform the conditions that produced violent extremism.\n\nThe frustrations of this approach \u2013 particularly the horrifically botched and costly occupation of Iraq \u2013 eventually led to a second phase of the war on terrorism. The Barack Obama administration emphasized lighter-footprint operations using drones and special operations forces, and it withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq, the war the president had made his reputation opposing. After initially \u2014 and reluctantly \u2014 surging more U.S. troops into Afghanistan, the Obama administration also began to wind down the American presence there after 2011. This strategy seemed effective for a time, but allowed the threat to come back with a vengeance, with rise of the Islamic State across Syria and Iraq in 2013-2014.\n\nThis setback led to a third phase of the fight against global terrorism, which began in the final innings of the Obama presidency and continued, for a time, under Trump. Having seen that relaxing the pressure on the enemy could backfire \u2014 and with ISIS and its sympathizers having perpetrated major attacks in Europe and the U.S. \u2014 American officials sought a middle ground between the two earlier approaches. This became a medium-footprint approach that employed modest numbers of ground troops, while also using airpower, logistics, intelligence and other enablers to support local partners in the fight against ISIS.\n\nTrump is now seeking to shift U.S. strategy once again. The president has no objection to smashing terrorist organizations that are suspected of plotting attacks against the U.S. Yet he seems desperate to end the post-conflict stability operations that tend to follow even medium-footprint operations like the one in Syria. The U.S. should \u201cONLY FIGHT TO WIN,\u201d he tweeted on Oct. 7, after American forces began to pull back from the Syria-Turkey border. If the threat returns, the U.S. can again apply overwhelming force: \u201cWe are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us!\u201d\n\nThere are a number of obvious problems with what the president is proposing. By paving the way for a Turkish invasion of northern Syria, the U.S. pullback is likely to distract and weaken the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces \u2014 America\u2019s principal ally there \u2014 and thereby make easier an ISIS resurgence. Trump\u2019s policy has the smell of abandoning the Kurds to the tender mercies an autocratic Turkish regime that is frequently hostile to American policy objectives. U.S. retrenchment may also set off a scramble for influence in northern Syria, empowering Russia, Iran and other bad actors.\n\nFor all these reasons, the president\u2019s decision earned harsh rebukes in Washington: Senator Lindsey Graham, who had backed Trump strongly since the 2016 election, called the pullback \u201cthe biggest mistake of his presidency.\u201d Yet when one cuts through the specific critiques of Trump\u2019s policy, the basic dispute comes back to a familiar issue: competing assessments of cost and risk.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The deal with Turkey to pull U.S. troops out of Syria is a typical Trumpian mess, with rash, poorly planned presidential action leading to pernicious \u2014 and downright bloody \u2014 consequences.
