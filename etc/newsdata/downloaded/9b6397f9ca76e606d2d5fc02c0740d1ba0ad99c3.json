A poll by research firm YouGov suggests U.K. voters support the agreement by a margin of 2:1.\n\nGlobal central bankers were, meanwhile, cool on rate cut prospects.\n\nReserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said recent rate cuts were working and extreme monetary policy measures \u2013 such as negative interest rates and quantitative easing \u2013 were \u201cextraordinarily unlikely\u201d.\n\nBank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden put the prospect of rate hikes back on the table but only if the U.K. leaves the EU smoothly, with a transitional deal. Ramsden told Bloomberg in an interview that Brexit uncertainty has damaged the supply capacity of the British economy, lowering the rate at which it can grow without generating inflation in future.\n\nTwo officials of the Federal Reserve made clear their lack of enthusiasm just before the U.S. central bank entered its \u201cquiet period\u201d, where its doesn\u2019t make public comments ahead of a policy meeting. The Fed is due to meet between Oct 29 and 30, and there are expectations it will approve a third straight quarter point cut for the year.\n\nDallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said on Friday the Fed\u2019s two cuts so far this year don\u2019t represent the start of a \u201cfull-fledged rate cutting cycle.\u201d\n\nKaplan said he expected strong consumer demand to keep sustaining the U.S. economy through a soft patch in business investment caused by trade uncertainty. His sentiments were echoed more starkly at the same event Kansas City Fed chief Esther George, who had already dissented from the last two decisions to cut the fed funds rate, chimed in:\n\n\"While weakness in manufacturing and business investment is evident, it is not clear that monetary policy is the appropriate tool to offset the risks faced by businesses in those sectors, when weighted against the costs that could be associated with such action,\u201d George said.", "description": "Gold Dips on Day, But up on Week Ahead of Brexit Vote", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA5M0AC_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
