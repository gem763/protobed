A second fight with Tyson Fury has been marked for February 22nd, too, after the two combatants fought to a draw last December.\n\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m just missing one belt,\u201d Ruiz Jr. said. \u201cOne belt to be the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world and that\u2019s the goal, but I don\u2019t want to look past Anthony Joshua.\n\n\u201cMy eyes are on the prize with him, so after I win that fight, then I can fight Deontay Wilder or Tyson Fury.\u201d", "description": "Deontay Wilder has said he believes a fight with\u00a0Andy Ruiz. would be even bigger than a clash with Britain\u2019s\u00a0Anthony Joshua.
