The building was recently purchased by Liberty owner Joe Tsai, who also owns the Nets.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to the Liberty\u2019s long-term success in New York and relocating the team to Brooklyn will provide the franchise with tremendous opportunity,\u201d said David Levy, CEO of the Brooklyn Nets and Barclays Center, as well as president of J Tsai Sports.\n\n\u201cWith many of our fans based in the five boroughs, moving to Barclays Center will make the Liberty more centrally located, allowing us to bring back the original fan base and attract new supporters. The venue change, along with the first pick in the 2020 WNBA Draft, has positioned the team for an exciting future.\u201d\n\nBarclays is a huge upgrade for the Liberty. The team played the past two seasons at Westchester County Center, where capacity was more than 2,000 and sellouts were rare. The move to Westchester came as former owner James Dolan was looking to sell the team and save money. Playing at Madison Square Garden - the Liberty\u2019s home for most of the time since the franchise was formed in 1997 - cost about 20 times more than playing in Westchester.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have done this if we didn\u2019t think it would be profitable,\u201d Levy said.\n\nWNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has said many times since starting her job in July that the Liberty should play in a venue befitting a WNBA franchise.\n\n\u201cThe New York Liberty are part of the foundation of the W and have many of the most accomplished players and passionate fans since the inaugural season,\u201d she said. \u201cBarclays Center is the perfect venue to host New York\u2019s team and showcase world-class women\u2019s basketball. This move is key to driving the league to the next level.\u201d\n\nLevy said the ownership group did look at a few other venues, but it was apparent Barclays was the right place.\n\n\u201cIt came to be smart to bring it to Barclays Center,\u201d Levy said. \u201cWhere it\u2019s located, the community it\u2019s in. There are additional opportunities and there\u2019s the infrastructure in place.\u201d\n\nBarclays will open the lower bowl for most games, creating a capacity of more than 8,000, with the option to expand. New York played one regular-season game against Seattle in Barclays this past season and it drew well with a crowd of 7,715.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really exciting times for the Liberty,\u201d said Keia Clarke, the Liberty\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cI\u2019ve been with the team for some time - this being my ninth season - and there is really a lot of positive change. It\u2019s an increased opportunity for us. Playing in a professional caliber arena is important to our fans. We certainly aim to recreate that kind of atmosphere (from the Garden) as we move forward.\u201d\n\nThe Liberty players were living in Brooklyn last year, after living in Westchester for many years to be closer to the practice facility. They will be able to walk to the arena from their apartments and be active in the community.\n\n\u201cCommunity is part of the Liberty DNA. They spend their time at restaurants, walk through that community,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cReinserting ourselves in the boroughs is a great thing for the players and staff alike.\u201d\n\nClarke said the Liberty will share many assets with the Nets. The staff will have offices at the Nets\u2019 training facility.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been a team in flux. To have a home and to finally plant roots feels really good,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cI\u2019m extremely excited where we\u2019re heading and excited to see how our fans continue to support us.\u201d\n\nThe team will have a new coach after the Liberty decided not to renew the contract of Katie Smith on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI would say there\u2019s no rhyme or reason to it,\u201d Clarke said of the timing of the coaching decision.\n\nOne thing that won\u2019t change is the team\u2019s name - the New York Liberty.\n\n\u201cWe thought about it, but that\u2019s a storied franchise and it was one of the original teams, one of the most well-known WNBA teams.\u201d Levy said. \u201cWhy would you change that name? A lot of fans love that brand name.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug Feinberg on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The New York Liberty will have a new home next year - Barclays Center.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Feinberg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/liberty_barclays_basketball_37043_c0-147-3517-2198_s1200x700.jpg?38c7d7c9d5b9c1fb6fc4bd8b1eb43d6c3bcb8c1b", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
