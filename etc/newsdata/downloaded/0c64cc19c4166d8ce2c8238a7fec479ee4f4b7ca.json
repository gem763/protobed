General Assembly in New York on Wednesday. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nFor decades, as Ukraine has drawn a parade of visiting American diplomats and officeholders and investors and political fixers, Russia has rarely been out of anyone\u2019s line of sight.\n\nIt\u2019s all about location \u2014 and Ukraine\u2019s now-hostile embrace with its big next door neighbor.\n\nUkraine has become a magnet for all sorts of visitors with expansive \u2014 and Moscow-looking \u2014 visions. Some see Ukraine as a key to its big neighbor. To others, Ukraine is a crack in Russia\u2019s armor.\n\nWhile Ukraine has a starring role in the impeachment inquiry in the House, Russia is never far away from anything that happens in Kiev\u2019s territory.\n\n\u201cUkraine is not another Russia,\u201d objected Yevhen Mahda, director of the Institute of World Policy in Kiev, while discussing on Saturday the dynamics of the turmoil stemming from the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nDuring that call, Trump urged Zelensky to work with Attorney General William P. Barr on a possible investigation into Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian gas company that had recruited him as a member of its board.\n\n\n\nA Ukrainian gas derrick not far from Poltava, Ukraine, in 2006.

Giuliani \u2014 sought to undermine accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nBut even before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Americans\u2019 dealings with Ukraine have all taken place in the context of its proximity to Russia.\n\n[Kurt Volker, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, resigns]\n\nThen-president George H.W. Bush told Ukrainians in August 1991 to stick with Moscow and try to preserve the collapsing Soviet Union. Hillary Clinton told Ukrainians in 2013 to spurn Moscow and sign an agreement with the European Union. Ukraine ignored them both.\n\nIn 2004, the United States and other countries sponsored exit polls that led to the overturning of a blatantly rigged election. That began an \u201cOrange Revolution\u201d that led some to hope that such an exercise in transparency could be duplicated in Russia.\n\nInstead it turned Russian President Vladimir Putin resolutely against \u201ccolor\u201d revolutions anywhere. And it didn\u2019t solve Ukraine\u2019s official corruption or general disregard for the rule of law.\n\nMore recently, Paul Manafort, who had gotten into a deep dispute with the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, saw a chance to redeem himself by working with the Kremlin-backed president in Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych. But in 2014, Yanukovych had to flee the country, and Manafort wound up in an American prison.\n\nThe man who had served as Yanukovych\u2019s prime minister, Mikola Azarov, currently lives in exile in Moscow to escape Ukrainian criminal charges.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) went to Kiev and cheered on the revolutionary crowds who resisted Yanukovych, as a way to send a message to Moscow. A relatively more honest government took office, but Ukraine lost Crimea to Russia in 2014, and has been mired in a separatist war in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAnd Ukraine\u2019s endemic corruption remains a fact of life.\n\n[Trump says he raised Hunter Biden allegations with China go-between]\n\nOn Friday, an International Monetary Fund delegation ended talks with Zelensky\u2019s government after failing to reach a new lending agreement.\n\n\u201cGrowth is held back by a weak business environment \u2014 with shortcomings in the legal framework, pervasive corruption, and large parts of the economy dominated by inefficient state-owned enterprises or by oligarchs \u2014 deterring competition and investment,\u201d an IMF statement read.\n\nWhen one of those oligarchs, Ihor Kolomoisky, was asked in an interview who would prevail if Zelensky was forced to choose between him and IMF loans, he replied simply: \u201cI will.\u201d\n\nKolomoisky, who had a business relationship with Zelensky, swears he has kept his distance since this year\u2019s presidential election. Critics don\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cKolomoisky\u2019s influence is direct and transparent,\u201d said Konstantin Batozky, a political analyst. The oligarch said that Ukraine can manage without IMF money.\n\nRunning like a river through every Ukrainian political scandal and conflict is the sale and shipment of natural gas. The transit of Russian gas westward to Europe dwarfs Ukraine\u2019s own consumption, by a factor of three in 2018.\n\nThe people who profit from it, Kolomoisky said, are not those with expertise in the gas business, but those with political links to the Ukrainian cabinet. \u201cThe business consists of putting documents from one pile onto another,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like making money out of thin air.\u201d\n\nAnd the upstream source of most of that money is Russia \u2014 which has been noticeably silent on the scandal even as some Ukrainians worry that in highlighting their failures of governance it plays into Putin\u2019s hands.\n\nIt was a gas company, Burisma, that brought Biden on board in 2014, in an apparent effort to clean up its image following the ouster of the graft-ridden Yanukovych administration. (Burisma deals with the extraction of Ukraine\u2019s own natural gas.) A criminal investigation was opened but then allowed to go dormant.\n\nOn Friday, the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine announced that the investigation covered the years 2010-2012 \u2014 during the Yanukovych years and before Biden joined the board. It said there was no evidence of any criminal wrongdoing by the American.\n\nSince the affair started to come to light earlier this month, it has served as a reminder of Ukraine\u2019s reputation for politically motivated prosecutions \u2014 albeit this time at the urging of the president of the United States.\n\nIf the country is unable to recast this moment as a fight against corruption, said Oleksandr Solontay, former head of the Power of the People Party, \u201cthen in the long-term perspective Ukraine will have an image of total corruption.\u201d\n\nIf Ukraine is not Russia, as Mahda accurately pointed out, it bears some cultural resemblance to its big neighbor. Ukrainians\u2019 own \u201chistorical inferiority complex,\u201d as he put it, helps to feed Western perceptions of their country always being in Russia\u2019s shadow.\n\nDavid L.
