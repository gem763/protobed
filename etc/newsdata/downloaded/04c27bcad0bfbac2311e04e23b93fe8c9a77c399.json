This is an important moment, not only for this litigation, but for J&J, which is a company that has lost its way.\u201d\n\nMore than 13 000 lawsuits have been filed over the drug, but Murray\u2019s is the first in which a jury decided to award punitive damages and came up with an amount.\n\nJ&J blasted the ruling as \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d in a statement posted on their website. The company, which is estimated to be worth nearly $400 billion (around R6 trillion), says they\u2019re confident that they can overturn the \u201cexcessive and unfounded verdict\u201d.\n\nBut Nicholas\u2019 victory is the latest in a series of costly legal setbacks for them.\n\nIn August this year, an Oklahoma judge ordered the company to pay $572 million (R8,5 billion) for contributing to the US state\u2019s opioid-addiction crisis.\n\nLast year, a jury in St. Louis ordered J&J to pay $4,69 billion (R71 billion) in damages to 22 women and their families who blamed ovarian-cancer on the use of the company\u2019s baby powder.\n\nSources: Forbes, Johnson & Johnsons, The Wall Street Journal, CNN, Reuters", "description": "A 26-year-old man has been awarded a huge payout after the drugs he took for autism spectrum disorder as a child made him grow breasts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9461/f21569209946456d94ccd9e8917d1819.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
