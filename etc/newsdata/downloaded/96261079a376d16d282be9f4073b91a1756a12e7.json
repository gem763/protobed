FOREX-Dollar loses steam vs yen as trade deal, Brexit hopes face reality check\n\n* Optimism fades as China wants more talks before inking\n\ndeal\n\n* Sterling slips as Brexit uncertainty rules\n\n* Lira unmoved after Washington announces sanctions on\n\nTurkey\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n\n\nBy Tomo Uetake\n\nSYDNEY, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered below\n\n2-1/2-month highs against the yen on Tuesday, failing to extend\n\nrecent gains as optimism over trade negotiations between the\n\nworld's two largest economies and for an orderly British exit\n\nfrom the European Union started to fade.\n\nIn early Asian trade, the dollar was steady at 108.35\n\nagainst the yen, still not far from its 2-1/2-month high of\n\n108.63 yen marked on Friday.\n\nThe euro also stood flat at $1.1026 versus the\n\ngreenback, off Friday's three-week high of $1.1062.\n\nAlthough markets initially welcomed the \"Phase 1\" trade deal\n\nbetween the United States and China that President Donald Trump\n\noutlined last week, a lack of details kept many investors\n\ncautious.\n\n\"Media reports suggest China wants another high-level\n\nmeeting later this month to finalise Friday's agreement,\n\nsuggesting that not all the details are nailed down,\" said Alex\n\nStanley, senior interest rate strategist at National Australia\n\nBank.\n\n\"Market participants are conscious that previous U.S.-China\n\n'agreements' have subsequently broken down amidst\n\nmisunderstandings among the two sides.\"\n\nA Bloomberg report on Monday, citing sources, said China\n\nwants more talks as soon as the end of October to hammer out the\n\ndetails of Trump's phase 1 deal before Chinese President Xi\n\nJinping agrees to sign it. The negotiation between the UK and the European Union over\n\nBritain's exit also looked equally fleeting.\n\nSterling slipped from a three-month high touched on Friday\n\nas last week's euphoria gave way to doubts over whether a timely\n\nBrexit deal could be clinched. The pound was last quoted at\n\n$1.2604 versus the dollar, little changed on the day.\n\nA deal to smooth Britain's departure from the EU hung in the\n\nbalance on Monday after diplomats indicated the bloc wanted more\n\nconcessions from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and said a full\n\nagreement was unlikely this week. Johnson says he wants to strike an exit deal at an EU summit\n\non Thursday and Friday to allow an orderly departure on Oct. 31.\n\nIf an agreement is not possible, he says he will lead the United\n\nKingdom out of the club it joined in 1973 without a deal - even\n\nthough parliament has passed a law saying he cannot do so.\n\nThe lira showed limited reaction after Trump imposed new\n\nsanctions on Turkey, but the currency stayed near seven-week\n\nlows against the dollar on concerns about a fallout from the\n\ncountry's incursion in northern Syria. In early Asia, the lira stood at 5.9239 per dollar\n\nTRYTOM=D4 , after having weakened some 0.8% on Monday.\n\n\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Dollar loses steam vs yen as trade deal, Brexit hopes face reality check", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB3C0TV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
