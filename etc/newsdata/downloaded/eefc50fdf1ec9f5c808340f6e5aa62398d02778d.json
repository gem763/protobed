As an American-based basketball league operating globally, among our greatest contributions are these values of the game.\u201d\n\nSilver, who's previously been lauded for his progressive stewardship of the NBA, said he still plans to go to China on Wednesday in advance of preseason games there between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets.\n\nNBA'S CONTROVERSY WITH CHINA IS ALL ABOUT MONEY, SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISING TO ANYONE, JESSE WATTERS SAYS\n\nThe current flap arose after Morey tweeted a picture of a slogan reading \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d But Morey deleted the tweet after significant blowback \u2014 including a tweet from Rockets owner Tillman Fertitta saying Morey \"does NOT speak for\" the team. Morey later backtracked on his advocacy.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d\n\nTED CRUZ KNOCKS NBA IN TWEET DEFENDING 'SOUTH PARK' IN CHINA\n\nMorey's initial tweet led to several Chinese sportswear brands suspending ties with the Rockets. The Chinese Basketball Association also canceled a preseason event involving the Rockets\u2019 G-League affiliate, according to The Athletic.\n\nSilver said later at a press conference the league was \u201capologetic\u201d over the outcome, but was \u201cnot apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of speech,\" though Morey appeared to do that himself in his damage-control tweet. Silver added that he \u201cregrets\u201d how so many Chinese people and NBA fans were upset by Morey's message.\n\nGeng Shuang, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said ordinary people have already expressed their position over the tweet.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cHow can it be possible to carry out exchanges and cooperation with China without knowing China's public opinion?\u201d Geng asked. \u201c[The] NBA's cooperation with China has been going on for quite a long time, so what should be said and what should be done, they know best.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Amid growing backlash against\u00a0NBA owners for siding with deep-pocketed Beijing powerbrokers over one of their own employees --\u00a0who was\u00a0rebuked for a pro-Hong Kong protest tweet --\u00a0the league's commissioner released a statement Tuesday morning seeking to clarify the NBA's relationship with the controversial communist country.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
