You want to make good tackles, that\u2019s all you really want to do.\n\n\u201cSometimes you slip up and you\u2019ll get deemed high tackle now.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really think about it, you\u2019ve just got to do what you do and try to tackle properly.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s just something you\u2019ve got to be wary of, any rule that comes in, especially that one at the moment. But it doesn\u2019t change too much day to day.\u201d\n\nCoach Eddie Jones had declined to discuss the Francis incident after Thursday\u2019s game but said England, who won the match 45-7, would accept whatever decision came their way.\n\n\u201cWe never discuss that area, we leave it to the judiciary or the citing commission,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll take whatever is handed out.\u201d\n\nThe game also saw the first red card handed out at the 2019 World Cup with U.S. flanker John Quill sent off for a shocking shoulder charge to the head of replacement centre Owen Farrell, who was a sitting duck after knocking on.\n\nFormer England coach Clive Woodward slammed Quill\u2019s hit and also took aim at Samoans Ray Ley Lo and Motu Matu\u2019u, who were cited for controversial tackles against Russia.\n\n\u201cThe ugly assault on Owen Farrell by John Quill late in the second half is why we have red cards and the deliberate, targeted high shots by the Samoans Ray Ley Lo and Motu Matu\u2019u against Russia are why we dismiss the disgraced players from the field of play and ban them,\u201d he wrote in his column for the Daily Mail.\n\n\u201cThey are the deliberate, callous, illegal challenges that the game must eradicate and must always be punished with an automatic red and a ban so they see the error of their ways.\u201d\n\nRey had an initial six-game ban reduced to three for his good record and conduct at the hearing while Matu\u2019u has yet to hear the result of his disciplinary review.\n\nEngland\u2019s Farrell, who finished the game against the Americans despite the Quill hit, came away with a deep gash in his nose from an earlier tackle.\n\nAnd while coach Eddie Jones joked that part of Farrell\u2019s nose had been found on the field, attack coach Scott Wisemantel downplayed the injury to the England skipper.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine, he still has his looks,\u201d he said.", "description": "England fullback Elliot Daly says World Rugby's clampdown on high tackles is a positive move that puts a priority on safety but in terms of how players tackle it really does not change too much.", "authors": ["Peter Rutherford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434404005&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0AM", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
