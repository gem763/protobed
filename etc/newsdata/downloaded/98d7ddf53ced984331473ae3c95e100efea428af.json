Mitsubishi has an idea, and it\u2019s calling the Mitsubishi Mi-Tech, an open-top SUV that has been stripped of doors and possesses a gas-powered turbine engine. All that to say: they\u2019re going to be badass.\n\nThe Mi-Tech was teased a few weeks ago, but the full release confirms all the exciting speculation we\u2019d seen at the start of October. There\u2019s a hell of a lot going on here, so we\u2019ll start off with Mitsubishi\u2019s press release to whet your appetite:\n\nThe MI-TECH CONCEPT was built to be \u201csmall plug-in hybrid electric SUV that delivers unparalleled driving pleasure and confidence over all terrain in light and wind.\u201d This concept car embodies the MMC brand statement \u201cDrive Your Ambition\u201d with a lightweight, compact, new PHEV drivetrain, a four-motor electric 4WD system, and advanced driver assist and preventive safety technologies \u2014 all packed into the small-sized electrified SUV. The power generator in the new PHEV drivetrain is a lightweight, compact gas turbine engine-generator in place of the traditional gasoline engine. As environmental awareness grows and downsizing progresses, the concept explores the technological proposition to plug the PHEV drivetrain into a small SUV. The gas turbine engine-generator has a powerful output for its size and weight.\n\nTurbines are mechanically simpler than a traditional ICE engine and use the pressure from exploding fuel to turn a turbine and produce thrust. It\u2019s a linear force, not a piston engine\u2019s rotational force. So, the Mi-Tech isn\u2019t totally electric, but it is electrified.\n\nI\u2019ll admit: the exterior of the Mi-Tech is a little busy and a little clunky. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s terrible, but it does kind of feel like I\u2019m looking at a child\u2019s elaborate drawing of their ideal car. Especially the front grille; it\u2019s pretty messy when looking at actual photos of the prototype and not just concept renderings.\n\nMitsubishi Mi-Tech concept - ignore the beach buggy looks and hidden in here somewhere is 2021 Mitsubishi ASX. #TMS2019 pic.twitter.com/4chjikbVEd \u2014 Steve Fowler (@SteveFowler) October 23, 2019\n\nThere are some good shapes going on in there, though. The T-shaped headlights are, frankly, really fucking cool. The copper accents on the front fascia would look fantastic if they weren\u2019t surrounded by the mesh-looking grille. And the windshield looks pretty slick.\n\nThe interior makes up for the exterior, though. There are almost no buttons on this bad boy, with a digital instrument cluster and a huge heads-up display taking centre stage. Which is probably for the best. If you\u2019re going off-roading, you don\u2019t want a bunch of grit getting caked in all your buttons and knobs.\n\nAs cool as it is, though, there are no plans to bring this thing into production. We can just nod and appreciate.", "description": "What are buggies going to look like in 20 years?
