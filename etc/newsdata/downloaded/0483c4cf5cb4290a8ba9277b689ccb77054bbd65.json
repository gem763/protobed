(Photo: Matt Rourke, AP)\n\nA former university professor in Philadelphia spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal money for local strip clubs and sports bars over a 10-year period, the Justice Department says.\n\nDr. Chikaodinaka D. Nwankpa misused $189,062 of government grants from July 2007 through April 2017 while working at Drexel University, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nThe university has agreed to pay back the money to resolve its potential civil liability in the case. Drexel said in a statement sent to USA TODAY Tuesday that it takes \"allegations of unethical or unlawful business conduct ... very seriously.\"\n\nThe government\u2019s investigation began in 2017 after Drexel voluntarily disclosed fraudulent charges to eight federal grants that it received from the Navy, the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.\n\nCollege hazing: Ohio University suspends all frats, citing hazing allegations against 7 chapters\n\nOpioid epidemic: Prestigious universities around the world accepted more than $60M from OxyContin family\n\nThe grants were supposed to be spent on energy and naval technology related research, but an internal audit revealed that Nwankpa used the money for personal iTunes purchases and for \u201cgoods and services\u201d provided by Cheerleaders, Club Risque and Tacony Club.\n\nThe Justice Department says Drexel has been cooperative in the government\u2019s investigation to determine the full scope of the former professor's spending.\n\nDrexel said in its statement that Nwankpa was immediately placed on administrative leave during the investigation.\n\nHe subsequently resigned from his position, paid back the university $53,328 and was barred from federal contracting for six months; however, he has not been charged with a crime.\n\n\u201cThis is an example of flagrant and audacious fraud, and a shameful misuse of public funds.\u201d said U.S. Attorney William M. McSwain. \u201cThe agencies providing these grant funds expect them to be used towards advancements in energy and naval technology for public benefit, not for personal entertainment.\u201d\n\nCollege towns: Some of the best in the US include Athens, Ga., and Ames, Iowa\n\n7 ways to save money on college: From choosing a major to buying textbooks\n\nMcSwain lauded Drexel for reporting the matter but expressed disappointment that Nwankpa's conduct \"went unnoticed for so long.\"\n\nDrexel stated that the university is improving its auditing controls and training staff to recognize \"financial irregularities\" and report fraud.\n\nNCIS Northeast Field Office Special Agent in Charge Leo S. Lamont stated that the misuse of taxpayer money not only \u201ceroded the public trust\u201d but also jeopardized efforts to obtain the best technology and research.\n\nNwankpa has been with the university since 1990, according to his Drexel faculty bio. He was named head of the university's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department in 2015.\n\nIn the same bio description, he boasts authoring hundreds of refereed journal and conference papers that were supported by grants totaling over $10 million.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/08/drexel-university-professor-spends-federal-grants-strip-clubs-bars/3906214002/", "description": "Drexel University in Philadelphia has agreed to pay back the grant money, including federal funds from the Navy and Department of Energy.", "authors": ["Adrianna Rodriguez", "Published A.M.
