To explain the data briefly, USREX doesn\u2019t allocate investments on the state level, it invests on the city level, so the chart you\u2019ll see below is an aggregation of all its city weightings for each state.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Source: Bowyer Research]\n\nThe above chart shows our over/underweight percentage in residential real estate compared to a cap-weighted index in every U.S. state. The darker the green, the higher our overweight in that state.\n\nIn many of the states that are growing -- Florida, South Carolina, Idaho, and Arizona just to name a few -- we\u2019re overweight, and in many of the states that have lost population -- New York, Kansas, Montana -- we\u2019re underweight.\n\nThe tendency of a cap-weighting approach is to overweight based on past performance, and that can be seen on the state level, where states that people are moving away from are still receiving relatively high weightings. A productivity-weighted approach, on the other hand, has tended to overweight USREX in the states that are attracting more new residents.\n\nSo, when you follow a cap-weighted approach, every time you put a dollar in, that strategy will tend to move a disproportionate share of that dollar into the states that it seems people are tending to move out of. Do you really think moving money into states that people are moving away from is the best way to allocate capital?
