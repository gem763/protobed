What was initially a Kurdish force of ground troops with air and logistical support from a US-led coalition has expanded into an administration controlling 30% of Syria, east of the Euphrates river.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Kurdish security officer stands guard at a rally against Turkish threats to invade the region in Qamishli in August.

Once a Kurdish area, it is now governed under a communal structure involving a complex set of committees representing seven \u201ccantons\u201d \u2013 including Sunni-Arab dominated areas \u2013 with each post jointly held by a man and a woman.\n\nWesterners in the area still travel under armed guard in fast-driven vehicles, and there are obvious signs of war damage, decaying infrastructure and only the most basic economy. According to the local military, Isis sleeper cells remain active. The administration says it holds 6,000 Isis prisoners, although the figure may be higher, and over 100,000 displaced persons in overcrowded prisons and increasingly lawless camps, which officials admit they are struggling to control.\n\nLocal politicians are concerned about what they say is western indifference. Amina Omar, the co-chair of the Syrian Democratic Council in the desert town of Ain Issa, said \u201cwe deserve to be supported\u201d in the light of the sacrifices of the eight-year war against Isis.\n\nOmar said: \u201cWe have had no political support from the international community to begin working towards our aims\u201d and accused Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, of wanting \u201cto initiate a war\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A merchant sells grains at a market in Qamishli in north-east Syria in September. Photograph: Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt the UN general assembly in New York last week, Erdo\u011fan called for the creation of a 30km deep \u201csafe zone\u201d on the Syrian side of the border that could resettle up to 3 million refugees currently in Turkey, a proposal that the fledgling administration has already rejected. \u201cThis is blackmailing the refugees,\u201d Omar said.\n\nA cross-party British parliamentary delegation, led by Labour backbencher Lloyd Russell-Moyle, visited north-east Syria in September to begin a process of rallying political support. \u201cGlobal civilisation owes them a debt, both of honour and of practical assistance to rebuild their damaged region,\u201d he said.\n\nUntil now, UK participation has been limited to an unacknowledged presence of British special forces, with whom commanders of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they enjoy \u201ca good relationship\u201d. The UK forces are based with 1,000 US troops who provide ultimate support to the fledgling administration.\n\nPolitical engagement has been minimal. On a visit to London in February, \u00celham Ehmed, the co- of the \u201cexecutive council\u201d of the Syrian Democratic Council, was only met by mid-ranking civil servants in a cafe away from the Foreign Office building.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle speaks during a visit to north-east Syria in September.

It is particularly visible in the country\u2019s male YPG and female YPJ militias, key components of the SDF, whose list of martyrs highlights their defence against Isis and \u201cTurkish fascism\u201d.\n\nBut as the fighting has drawn to a conclusion, north-east Syria has sought to reinvent itself. It is no longer a solely Kurdish region: about 1.5 million of the population are Kurds, clustered near the Turkish border where the safe zone is proposed, while the rest are mostly Sunni Arabs from former Isis centres in the Euphrates valley.\n\nPolygamy and underage marriage have been outlawed as part of a \u201claw of women\u201d but while this has been observed in Kurdish areas, implementation in newly taken Arab areas has been patchy.\n\nRelations with Assad\u2019s Russian-backed regime are relatively calm, although limited, with officials even acknowledging privately that they sell some of the oil they control west of the Euphrates, in defiance of US sanctions. \u201cThere is no serious fight and there is no serious dialogue,\u201d said Gen Mazlum Kobane, the commander of the SDF.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A rally in support of Kurdish leader Abdullah \u00d6calan in Qamishli in February.

Once ubiquitous posters of the jailed leader are in shorter supply, although are still found inside some public buildings as well on the martyrs\u2019 billboard. \u201cWe are willing to do whatever it takes not to threaten the national security of Turkey,\u201d Kobane said.\n\nThe militias are integrated into the 70,000 strong SDF, which is also 35% female, and politicians claim that there is little or no PKK influence. \u201cOur project has nothing to do with the PKK at all,\u201d Omar argued, although she acknowledged that many PKK members have come from Syria.\n\nSyria safe zone plan may just be wishful thinking Read more\n\nNorth-east Syria is careful not to describe itself as independent, at a time when there is no international appetite for partition. But US military support has become critical.\n\nLast December, Donald Trump announced a plan to withdraw all ground troops from Syria in the belief that Isis was defeated. After intense lobbying the decision was reversed, and local politicians diplomatically said that Trump had been \u201cwrongly briefed\u201d on the military situation.\n\nInstead, north-east Syria agreed to withdraw SDF and YPJ forces away from the Turkish border and allow US and Turkish soldiers to patrol, creating a border buffer zone 5km deep between the Tigris and the Euphrates, and 20km deep for heavy weapons.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Turkish soldiers patrol the streets in Afrin in early 2018. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nThe concern locally is that the deal has not proved to be enough to placate Turkey. \u201cPresident Erdo\u011fan seems to regret what has been agreed,\u201d Kobane said, warning the Turks to brace themselves \u201cfor a long war\u201d if they try to invade.\n\nMindful of Turkish sensibilities, last week Brig Gen Christian Wortman, the deputy director of operations in the US-European command, heaped praise on the Turks as he talked up the new security arrangement. \u201cThe intention of this security mechanism is to address Turkey\u2019s legitimate security concerns,\u201d Wortman said.\n\nMemories, however, linger of Turkey\u2019s 2018 occupation of Afrin, historically a Kurdish area, and the ensuing population displacement which has seen thousands of Kurds leave.\n\nPhotographs circulate in Kurdish political circles showing the destruction of agricultural areas and the desecration of cemeteries, and it is estimated that 30% of SDF leaders come from Afrin, the bulk of whom are opposed to the border zone settlement that has been agreed with Turkey.\n\nDr Abdulkarim Omar, the co-chair of foreign affairs of the SDC, accuses Turkey of human rights violations, and says that the occupation was allowed to take place through a deal between Turkey and Russia, and \u201camid the silence of the international community, so there was a kind of international cover\u201d.\n\nThey hope that by rallying western support that won\u2019t happen again.", "description": "As tensions with Turkey continue unabated, officials in the region say western indifference is part of the problem", "authors": ["Dan Sabbagh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/763bb50398e432cda5bbde83f0bb985028619b83/0_59_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0ac73225d6135d13a3146efff0bf34f0"}
