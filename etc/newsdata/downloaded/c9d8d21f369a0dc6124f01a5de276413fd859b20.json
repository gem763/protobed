Here founding member Khumo Tapfumaneyi talks rhyming and early literacy.\n\nRhyme is extremely important in early literacy development, as it helps to engage young readers. There are numerous benefits to being exposed to nursery rhymes and rhyming books.\n\n\n\nSkills such as the ability to listen and keep a steady beat are developed. Children also learn to retell and/or sing stories from a young age before they are able to read.\n\nThey are able to compute rhyming sentences and identify words that don\u2019t rhyme. This can lead to them inventing their own words or making up a string of rhymes \u2013 hence developing creativity and the ability to discern patterns.\n\nChildren\u2019s early literacy skills are not just about reading and writing, but more about listening and speaking. It\u2019s important for children to identify phonics, rhyming patterns and sounds in material.\n\nWe recommend adding some rhyme to your children\u2019s reading repertoire with these fantastic local books.\n\nMzansi Nursery Rhymes by Tumi Wessie\n\n\n\n\n\nThis multilingual book that comes with an audio CD takes adults back to childhood with the songs we all grew up on, and is an opportunity for the young ones to learn the classics.\n\nMpumi\u2019s Magic Beads by Lebohang Masango\n\n\n\n\n\nA beautifully written and illustrated story about three schoolgirls and their adventures as they are transported by their friend Mpumi\u2019s magical beads.\n\nWordsmith and poet Lebohang Masango keep the little ones captivated throughout the story with her clever use of rhyme.\n\nObnoxious Naledi and the Poppysmic Fairy by Tracy-Lee Easthorpe\n\n\n\n\n\nTracy-Lee introduces children to complex, everyday words with her quirky Dr Seuss writing style.\n\nThe words that children are introduced to in this visual feast are \u2018poppysmic\u2019 - the sound one makes when you smack your lips together.\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
