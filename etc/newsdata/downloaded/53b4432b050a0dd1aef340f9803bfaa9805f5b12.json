The cross is engraved with decorations that, experts say, are highly unusual and may represent the four Gospels \u2013 Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John\n\nThe objects were found in a pot unearthed by a metal detectorist in the Scottish county of Dumfries and Galloway in 2014\n\n'There is some reason, therefore, to suspect that the Galloway \"Viking\" Hoard may have been deposited by a people who, to judge by name and choice of script, may have considered themselves part of the English-speaking world.\n\n'It is even possible that these were locals: Galloway had been part of Anglo-Saxon Northumbria since the early eighth century, and was referred to as the 'Saxon coast' in the Irish chronicles as late as the 10th century.'\n\nAs well as on Egbert's arm ring, Anglo-Saxon runes were found on other objects but have not been deciphered to a meaningful extent.\n\nThe researchers suggest the name band was put there as a marker of the person who owned and buried the treasure.\n\nThe hoard was bought by National Museums Scotland for \u00a31.98million after being found by an amateur metal detectorist\n\nDr Adrian Maldonado, a National Museums researcher, said the find was 'really exciting'.\n\n'We don't know any more about Egbert than his name right now but there's something really tantalising about connecting the Galloway Hoard with a named person,' he said.\n\n'Egbert is a common Anglo-Saxon name, and with more research on the rest of the contents of the hoard we will be able to narrow down its dating and suggest some candidates from the historical record.\n\n'If the hoard belonged to a person or group of Anglo-Saxon speakers, does it mean they were out raiding with other Vikings? Or that these Viking hoards were not always the product of Scandinavian raiders?\n\n'There are other explanations, but either way this transforms our thinking on the \"Viking Age\" in Scotland.'\n\nAn exhibition of the Galloway Hoard will be displayed at the National Museum of Scotland in May, and will then tour the country until 2022.", "description": "Researchers inspecting the items dug up by an amateur metal detectorist in 2014 have managed to decipher runes on an armband which suggest the owner of the treasure was Anglo-Saxon.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/16/19213968-0-image-a-5_1570031310787.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
