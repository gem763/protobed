Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) warned, \u201cWe\u2019ve lowered the bar on impeachment so much\u2026it will be used as a routine tool to fight political battles.\u201d\n\nHis colleague Nancy Pelosi said, \u201cIt\u2019s about a punishment searching for a crime that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nJerry Nadler (D-NY) told us, \u201cAn impeachment of a president is an undoing of a national election.\u201d\n\nNow that Trump occupies the Oval Office they\u2019ve thrown all that out the window and are leading the impeachment charade stemming from a partisan CIA operative who filed a whistleblower complaint over the president\u2019s July phone call with the president of Ukraine. And now we\u2019ve learned the whistleblower filed the complaint after colluding with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s office.\n\nNo foul play there, huh?\n\nSchiff is a well-known Trump foe and architect of the debunked Russian collusion hoax. His lying this week about his secretive contacts with the partisan whistleblower earned 4 Pinocchios from the lefty Washington Post.\n\nBut who\u2019s surprised given the number of political operatives we\u2019ve seen in the Department of Justice and U.S. intelligence agencies who\u2019ve targeted the president from the get-go: trying at first to stop him from getting elected, and when that failed, deploying every dirty trick in the book to derail the current administration and remove him from office.\n\nThe yearslong effort amounts to an assault on our Democracy. Citizens are supposed to choose their representatives in free elections, not deep state spooks with unchecked power and an ax to grind.\n\nFirst we saw the illicit spying and dubious counterintelligence investigation into Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, orchestrated by former FBI director James Comey and his lieutenants Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page and other snakes within the DOJ who were central players in Crossfire Hurricane the FBI\u2019s code name for the operation targeting Hillary Clinton\u2019s political opponents.\n\nWhen that political hit job flopped, they tried to implement the \u201cinsurance policy\u201d outlined in a text that disgraced Peter Strzok sent his lover alluding to the Russian collusion hoax \u2014 a propaganda campaign disseminated by Democrats and their mouthpieces in the #FakeNewsMedia.\n\nWhat\u2019s been torched is the left\u2019s credibility \u2014 and that of the media \u2014 especially after the special counsel found no evidence of conspiracy following a costly, 22-month investigation.\n\nSo now instead of respecting our Democracy and letting the electorate decide Trump\u2019s fate at the ballot box in 13 short months, Democrats and their co-conspirators in the intelligence community are trying to nullify the votes of 63 million Americans who elected Trump in 2016.\n\nA disgrace no fair minded American should tolerate.\n\nIt\u2019s time to drain the swamp once and for all.\n\nAdriana Cohen is a nationally syndicated columnist and TV commentator.
