The tech giant has filed a patent this year that gives a glimpse into what it may be developing behind closed doors\n\nKuo has also referenced the possibility of a new iPad Pro which could come equipped with 3D sensor similar to a True-Depth feature in iPhones.\n\nThis feature allows the device to capture more of the environment around subjects in photos and video and could help future efforts at improving augmented reality experiences on the device.", "description": "The iPhone XR (pictured above) is among Apple's newest 'budget' offerings, despite retailing at a rather hefty $599.
