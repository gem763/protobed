Those who partake in either of these so-called \"hateful\" acts can be fined up to $250,000 per offense, the Washington Times reported. The Commission took issue with the word \"alien\" because it's used as a means of dehumanizing non-citizens.\n\n\u201c\u2018Alien\u2019 \u2014 used in many laws to refer to a \u2018noncitizen\u2019 person \u2014 is a term that may carry negative connotations and dehumanize immigrants, marking them as \u2018other,'\u201d reads one passage of the memo. \u201cThe use of certain language, including \u2018illegal alien\u2019 and \u2018illegals,\u2019 with the intent to demean, humiliate, or offend a person or persons constitutes discrimination.\u201d\n\nAccording to the New York Post, the memo provides specific examples of what they are deeming to be illegal:\n\n\u201cA hotel prohibits its housekeepers from speaking Spanish while cleaning because it would \u2018offend\u2019 hotel guests or make them uncomfortable,\u201d reads one hypothetical. \u201cAn Indian immigrant family complains to their landlord about mold and cockroaches in their unit. The landlord tells them to \u2018just deal with it\u2019 and threatens to call ICE if they file a complaint in housing court,\u201d reads another. \u201cA store owner tells two friends who are speaking Thai while shopping in his store to \u2018speak English\u2019 and \u2018go back to your country,\u2019 \u201d reads a third.\n\nThe declaration comes after Mayor Bill de Blasio was outspoken about his opposition to immigration raids and crackdowns. This measure is said to be another way the city is rebuking the crackdown.\n\n\u201cIn the face of increasingly hostile national rhetoric, we will do everything in our power to make sure our treasured immigrant communities are able to live with dignity and respect, free of harassment and bias,\u201d said Carmelyn Malalis, the agency\u2019s commissioner, told the Post.", "description": "Seriously?.09/28/2019 17:21:10PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/9/69379f19-7a01-4bb6-be0c-ca3f596f583b.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
