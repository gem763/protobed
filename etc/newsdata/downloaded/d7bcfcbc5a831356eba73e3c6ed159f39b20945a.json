Over 96 bargain-filled hours, hundreds of retailers will be slashing their prices by up to 90% with some big-ticket items going for a fraction of their RRP. Here's everything you need to know, including the best sites to bookmark, online shopping tips and the dates to mark in your calendar.\n\nWhat is Black Friday?\n\nBlack Friday is the biggest shopping events on the US calendar, with retailers offering huge, unheard-of discounts on thousands of consumer products. Over the past few years, Aussie retailers have been getting in on the action too - so expect to see plenty of deals from Myer, Big W, Target, Kmart. Australia's online merchants will also be embracing Black Friday, including Amazon, eBay, Catch and scores of lesser known e-stores.\n\nWhen is Black Friday in Australia?\n\nBlack Friday officially takes place on the Friday after the US Thanksgiving holiday. In 2019, the date to mark in your calendar is November 29. However, as we have previously noted, the actual sales period is a lot looser, with many retailers releasing deals in advance and/or extending their discounts well into the following week. (There's also the similar 'Cyber Monday' event on 2 Decemelber, which is specifically geared towards online-only deals.)\n\nIn other words, you can expect plenty of bargains between November 26 and October 3 with the bulk of deals appearing on the aforementioned Friday and Monday. Also note that the US is a day behind us, which means their Black Friday lands on our Saturday - so keep an eye out for US deals that provide international shipping.\n\nWhat sort of deals can we expect?\n\nThere's always an element of hyperbole attached to Black Friday, especially in the mainstream press. You should therefore take all those hysterical news reports about $5 large-screen TVs with grain of salt.\n\nWith that said, there are always plenty of bargains on offer if you use judicious timing and know where to look. For example, it is likely Amazon and eBay will be running members-only flash sales on popular tech products. So you need to be prepared and you need to be fast.\n\nPSA: You Don't Have To Shop On Black Friday To Get Black Friday Deals In the olden days, Black Friday was the big day for holiday shopping.
