RZSS/PA\n\n\u201cThese figures show a vast and worrying variation in the proportion of rape cases referred by different police forces to the CPS,\u201d Dame Vera Baird told The Independent.\n\n\u201cNot only are these differences inexplicable at first sight, but there is a risk that it suggests to victims that their prospect of getting justice is a postcode lottery.\u201d\n\nThe number of cases taken forward by the CPS also varies dramatically by region, as does the conviction rate for alleged rapists who reach court.\n\nIn Norfolk, the CPS only charged 18 per cent of cases referred by police in the period, but the figure was 70 per cent in Yorkshire.\n\nMeanwhile in Durham Constabulary\u2019s area, less than 10 per cent of suspects put on trial for rape were convicted, compared to two thirds in Cleveland.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Update newsletter preferences\n\nThe issue is a priority area of investigation in an ongoing government review of how rape cases are handled through the criminal justice system.\n\nAn \u201cofficial-sensitive\u201d document drawn up by the Prime Minister\u2019s Implementation Unit, and seen by The Independent, said prosecutions were falling for almost all types of crime but were \u201cparticularly poor for rape\u201d.\n\nIt said CPS charging decisions had dropped faster than the number of referrals from stretched police forces, who have been hit by the loss of 20,000 officers since 2010 and explosion in digital evidence.\n\nCivil servants found \u201csignificant variation by police force area\u201d, which was not linked to the number of rape reports received.\n\nThe document said the review would question what is driving the differences, saying \u201cfactors could include, for example, practice and resources within CPS region, changes in demand on police time and relative local prioritisation\u201d.\n\nIt will also look at why more victims are dropping out of rape investigations, why the CPS is proceeding with fewer prosecutions and why conviction rates sit at around 43 per cent.\n\nDame Vera said the gulf in referral rates suggested \u201cdifferences in policing practice and perhaps culture from one force to another\u201d.\n\n\u201cEveryone who has suffered rape should be encouraged to report it to the police,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cWe must be sure all victims can get that encouragement, and are confident that if they come forward and report, they will receive justice. \u201c\n\nShe is to ask HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services to examine forces at the bottom of a table compiled by The Independent, in order to maintain public confidence in the justice system.\n\nThe watchdog released in-depth figures for 2017-18 after separate statistics for the most recent financial year showed that the proportion of reported rapes being prosecuted stands at just 1.5 per cent.\n\nOne alleged victim told The Independent she felt the crime had been \u201cdecriminalised\u201d after her attacker was not charged, while rising numbers of complainants are dropping out of investigations amid demands for their mobile phones and personal records.\n\nRebecca Hitchen, campaigns manager at End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAW) said there were \u201cclear failings in the criminal justice system at every point\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt should not be a postcode lottery as to whether a case of rape reaches the CPS, or goes to court, but these statistics suggest it is,\u201d she told The Independent.\n\n\u201cThere should not be a 1 in 5 chance of a reported rape being referred to the CPS in one region and a 1 in 25 chance in another.\n\n\u201cPolice forces and CPS may have their own ways of working but surely, victims and survivors deserve a level of consistent practice across the board.\u201d\n\nEVAW is mounting a legal challenge against the CPS that claims it has \u201ccovertly changed its policy and practice in relation to decision-making on rape cases\u201d.\n\nThe CPS insists it has not changed its practices or code, which states that only cases with a \u201creasonable prospect of conviction\u201d can progress.\n\nPolice leaders are looking at potential reasons for regional variations, with hypotheses including differences in the use of \u201cearly investigative advice\u201d from prosecutors \u2013 which can cause investigations to be closed before a formal charging decision \u2013 different working practices in both CPS and police regions, varying capacity levels and personal relationships.\n\nThe National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead for rape said the body was working to
