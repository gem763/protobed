A Struggling India Needs More Trade, Not Less\n\n(Bloomberg Opinion) -- India, not long ago the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy, is struggling. Growth has plummeted to 5% \u2014 well below potential and not nearly enough to employ the millions of young Indians entering the workforce every year. Lending has slowed to a trickle, as has consumer demand. Voices across the political spectrum say the last thing the country can afford now is to lower its trade defenses. In fact, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s needed.\n\nIndia\u2019s immediate question is whether to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which if completed would represent the world\u2019s biggest free-trade agreement. Fifteen other nations \u2014 Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \u2014 appear ready to conclude nearly 30 rounds of negotiations when they meet this weekend in Bangkok. India is the main holdout.\n\nAlthough the agreement\u2019s ambitions have been scaled back since talks began in 2012, it would nevertheless encompass about 40% of global gross domestic product and 45% of the world\u2019s population. At a time when governments have been raising more barriers to trade than they\u2019re lowering, announcing a deal would give proponents of deeper global integration a welcome boost.\n\nCritics say joining RCEP would open up India to a flood of cut-rate Chinese goods, not to mention cheaper dairy products from Australia and New Zealand, worsening an already large trade deficit. Their objections reflect a more deep-rooted suspicion of free trade, one that\u2019s shared by many factions within the ruling coalition. Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s rhetoric about economic reform, his administration has adopted an increasingly protectionist stance.\n\nThat\u2019s a mistake. At this stage in its development, India needs more trade, not less. As country after country in East Asia has demonstrated, integrating into global value chains is a proven route to prosperity. The process raises productivity, boosts output, creates jobs and ultimately stimulates demand. The World Bank notes that joining such production networks increases per-capita incomes 50 times as much as standard trade does. There are few other plausible ways for India, which despite its size accounts for less than 2% of global merchandise exports, to employ its burgeoning population and make the transition from an agriculture-based economy.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember, too, that joining RCEP would lower barriers not just to finished products, but also to the cheap Chinese inputs needed to boost India\u2019s manufacturers. It would send a signal that India embraces rather than fears globalization, which would reassure companies that have heard too much recently about import substitution and protecting domestic industries. And it would help India to capitalize as factories shift production out of China due to rising labor costs and trade frictions with the U.S.\n\nMost important, lowering trade barriers would force India to compete. Much still needs to be done to make the country an attractive place to manufacture. Laws need to be changed so that companies can more easily acquire land and hire and fire workers. Investors are still deterred by India\u2019s red tape, corruption, clogged courts, uncertain policy-making and overzealous tax officials. Although RCEP wouldn\u2019t directly mandate internal reforms, the pressure of added competition would hopefully spur change.\n\nModi has long sought to portray himself as both a reformer and a global statesman. A bold decision in Bangkok would not only shore up his reputation on both fronts \u2014 it would point India in the direction of recovery.\n\n--Editors: Nisid Hajari, Timothy Lavin.\n\nTo contact the senior editor responsible for Bloomberg Opinion\u2019s editorials: David Shipley at davidshipley@bloomberg.net, .\n\nEditorials are written by the Bloomberg Opinion editorial board.\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "A Struggling India Needs More Trade, Not Less", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF15059_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
