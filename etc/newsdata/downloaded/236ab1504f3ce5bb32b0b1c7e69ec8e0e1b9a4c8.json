The research group Security Assistance Monitor noted in a report last fall that some two-thirds of the countries receiving U.S. counterterrorism aid, or 24 of 36 countries examined, \u201cposed serious corruption risks.\u201d In Ukraine\u2019s case, the Obama White House hesitated to provide military aid\u2014and avoided providing lethal aid altogether\u2014for other reasons, fearing that doing so would provoke Russia and worsen the conflict.\n\nAfter Barack Obama left, Trump announced, and Congress approved, a plan to provide anti-tank missiles as well, something both military and diplomatic officials had recommended. Joseph Dunford, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in congressional testimony in the fall of 2017 that \u201cUkraine needed additional capabilities to protect their sovereignty\u201d from Russia, which was supporting an insurgency in the eastern half of the country and had already seized the Crimean Peninsula. To the extent corruption was a concern at the time, it did not take precedence over the determination to try to stop Russian tanks.\n\nThe Pentagon specifically said Ukraine was making progress tackling corruption in a letter to Congress this spring, two months before Trump suspended aid and then raised the corruption issue in the phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, during which he asked for an investigation into Joe Biden\u2019s son. The letter from the Defense Department, which NPR first reported, certified that \u201cthe government of Ukraine has taken substantial actions to make defense institutional reforms for the purposes of decreasing corruption,\u201d among other things.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kathy Gilsinan", "Theatlantic.Com Politics Archive Military-Aid-Ukraine-Trump"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
