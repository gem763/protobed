Today, however, a report from Bloomberg reveals that Adobe is working on correcting that omission. Adobe is said to be planning to announce the release of the full version of Photoshop for the iPad in October of this year and to release the app in 2019. The company\u2019s Scott Belsky, chief product officer for Creative Cloud, confirmed the cross-platform edition of Photoshop, though not the timeline of its release.\n\nAdobe already offers a multiplicity of photo and imaging apps for iOS, including a simplified Photoshop Express. None of these mobile versions have quite lived up to the level of quality and flexibility of the company\u2019s PC and Mac apps, which has left room for mobile-focused competitors like Affinity Photo to garner a share of the market. Bloomberg describes the decision to release the full Photoshop on the iPad as a change of strategy for Adobe, which is increasingly looking to entice hobbyists and casual users as well as image-editing professionals. Belsky is quoted as saying there\u2019s been great demand from Photoshop users for the ability to make \u201cedits on the fly,\u201d which is what this Photoshop release will try to sate.", "description": "Adobe is working on the release of the full version of Photoshop for the iPad, according to the company\u2019s Scott Belsky.
