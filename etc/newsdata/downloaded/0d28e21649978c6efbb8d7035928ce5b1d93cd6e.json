Jim Rice\n\nFrydenberg\u2019s review was recommended by the Productivity Commission in January, following the Grattan Institute in November calling for the government to include the family home in age pension eligibility and to cancel the increases in compulsory superannuation contributions.\n\nThe recommendations press-ganged former Prime Minister Paul Keating into vituperation mode with Leigh Sales on 7:30, cursing Grattan\u2019s John Daley for \u201chis miserable view\u201d to \u201cpilfering, stealing, robbing the workforce of 2.5 per cent of income.\u201d\n\nWhether Keating is just protective of the system he established in 1992, is providing cover for the $2.8 trillion industry (and labour leverage) he created, or both, is almost beside the point. Suffice it to say, PJK is a stakeholder in this vexed domain to be managed at all times with the highest degree of sensitivity.", "description": "Whatever you think of Frydenberg\u2019s performance with the national abacus thus far, you cannot say he doesn\u2019t respect his elders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_187%2C$y_196/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8fa4a4b270348593b0d42118098d1877512ca34f", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
