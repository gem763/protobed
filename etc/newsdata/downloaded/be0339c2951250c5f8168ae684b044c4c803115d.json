It doesn\u2019t much matter at this point. Plenty of West Coast famous folks have dropped F-bombs and spoken out against President Trump, his administration and Republican voters in recent days.\n\nNow comes some good advice from one Hollywood veteran. Roger L. Simon \u2014 an Academy Award-nominated screenwriter, novelist, blogger and co-founder of PJ Media \u2014 says the curtain should close on such antics and attitudes. A finale is in order, with conservatives leading the way.\n\n\u201cTrump Derangement Syndrome in Tinseltown is simply around the bend and back and around the bend again \u2014 and again,\u201d writes Mr. Simon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for conservatives and what Townhall.com columnist Kurt Schlichter calls the \u2018Normals\u2019 to have an entertainment industry of their own. Hollywood has effectively divorced conservatives (and the Normals). And after a divorce, as they say, living well is the best revenge. The question is how.\u201d\n\nMr. Simon points out that conservative financiers prefer funding think tanks to the arty world. But then there is reality.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, one good movie or television series is worth more than a hundred, or even a thousand, position papers when it comes to moving society,\u201d Mr. Simon observes.\n\n\u201cWhat is needed here by investors on the right is a little guts for a change. It shouldn\u2019t be so hard, but somehow it is \u2014 or has been. It\u2019s obviously true that film, theatre, and publishing are risky investments, but the center-to-right audience is huge. Plenty of \u2018proof of concept\u2019 exists with films like \u2018The Blind Side,\u2019 \u2018Lone Survivor,\u2019 and \u2018American Sniper\u2019 \u2014 just some examples of box office smashes that fit that profile,\u201d he advises.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also obvious that mistakes will be made in forming companies like this \u2014 plenty of them. The lack of financial help has created a dearth of center or right talent. But all this can be corrected with effort, time and a bit of luck. As the Zen Buddhists say, \u2018You can\u2019t get there by trying. But you won\u2019t get there if you don\u2019t try.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Simon\u2019s newest novel \u201cThe Goat,\u201d by the way, was just published.\n\nHOLLYWOOD\u2019S QUIET CONSERVATIVES\n\n\u201cI think you would be surprised at the amount of conservatives in Hollywood,\u201d comedian Michael Loftus tells Fox News, citing \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d star Isaiah Washington, who vexed the locals after deciding to leave the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cPeople like Isaiah need to come forward. There are normal people out there. We just don\u2019t think big government is the solution. I\u2019m sorry, but that doesn\u2019t make us evil,\u201d Mr. Loftus said.\n\nLiberal Hollywood activists are tough, though.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to peel away Trump supporters, and make you feel like you\u2019re a weirdo if you lean to the right. \u2018There is something that must be wrong with you.\u2019 \u2018How can you be this evil?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re a Nazi.\u2019 It\u2019s horrifying. So good people need to stand up,\u201d Mr. Loftus advised.\n\nA LESSON FROM THE ROAD\n\nSome observers offer evidence that America is not necessarily the land of racial turmoil that certain politicians and news organizations claim it to be.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is take a road trip to find out America isn\u2019t racist. As I traveled across America this summer, I found something that would surprise many in the media. I found a lot of racial harmony,\u201d writes David Marcus, the New York correspondent for The Federalist.\n\nHe drove from Brooklyn to Arkansas, then on to California.\n\n\u201cEverywhere I went, in the bars and restaurants I haunted along the way, was a level of racial harmony that belies the notion of our nation as a hotbed of racism. The people I met along the way, and there were a lot of them, were white, black, brown, Asian, and Native American, and they weren\u2019t self-segregated within the establishments I found. Much the opposite: they were mixing, mingling, laughing, and drinking together without even a hint of racial tension,\u201d Mr. Marcus continues.\n\n\u201cWhat becomes clear very quickly is that for Americans who do not choose to center their sense of self on their demographic identities, a whole host of other interests and qualities animate their social behavior. Whether they were college football fans in a Barstow hotel bar, truckers sitting out front of a Greenville, Illinois, motel smoking and sharing beer and tales from the road, or more upscale denizens of a fancy Tulsa wine bar sniffing and swishing a new rose, nobody seemed to care much about skin color,\u201d the columnist says.\n\n\u201cNone of this is to say that racism is dead in our society; of course it is not,\u201d he notes. \u201cAs far as America has to go to live up to the promise of equality for all, it is wrongheaded and even dangerous not to celebrate how far our country, as diverse as it can be, has come.\u201d\n\nSO MUCH FOR CLIMATE CHANGE TV\n\nViewers were not particularly thrilled with CNN\u2019s recent seven-hour town hall on climate change, which featured 10 Democratic presidential hopefuls. Fox News aced the entire evening with its normal programming alone, according to Nielsen ratings \u2014 and in a big way.\n\nDuring the lengthy evening time slot, Fox News garnered 2.5 million viewers, while CNN drew 1.1 million, or less than half that number. Even liberal MSNBC did better than CNN, tallying 1.6 million. When all the climate talk was done, CNN ranked third in overall viewers for the seven-hour stretch.\n\nIn the prime-time hours, Fox News also dominated the airwaves with 3.2 million viewers \u2014 a percentage advantage in the triple digits over CNN\u2019s 1.3 million viewers and a double-digit advantage over MSNBC, which garnered 2.1 million.\n\nWEEKEND REAL ESTATE\n\nFor sale: Smith\u2019s Homestead, built in 1890 in Wallingford, Pennsylvania.
