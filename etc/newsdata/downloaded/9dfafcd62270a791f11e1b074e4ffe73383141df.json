TXN, -1.80% gave a forecast that was much worse than expected in a Tuesday earnings report, with a new revenue estimate range that fell as much as a half-billion dollars lower than Wall Street\u2019s consensus revenue estimate. That was not welcome news for investors, who have sent chip stocks higher in recent months on hopes that a downturn for the semiconductor industry would hit its nadir in third-quarter results and start turning around in the final three months of the year.\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor Index SOX, -0.77% is up nearly 40% this year, continuing a roller-coaster ride as the semiconductor downturn has persisted. The index has especially surged in the past quarter, adding 6.3% as the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.36% has gained just 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.15% has declined 1.2%.\n\nShares of TI tumbled nearly 10% in after-hours trading Tuesday, and other semi stocks fell as well, as TI executives blamed broad-based weakness among its customers, plus ongoing trade issues. In addition, the stocks of Intel Corp. INTC, -0.23% and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, -1.62% lost 1.6%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.20% fell 2.1% and Xilinx Inc. XLNX, +0.97% sank 1.7% in the after-hours trading session Tuesday.\n\nWhen analysts tried to get more specific information from the company about what exactly was causing the shortfall, TI executives responded in rather vague generalities while refusing to call a bottom to the downturn.\n\n\u201cIt is due to macro events, and specifically, the trade tensions, and if you think about when there\u2019s tensions in trade and obstacles to trade, what do businesses do? They become more cautious and they pull back, and we are at the very end of a long supply chain,\u201d TI Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi told analysts. \u201cThis thing we\u2019ve been in, it [has been] for four quarters and it\u2019s going to be longer than that.\u201d\n\nSome analysts wondered if TI\u2019s issues were due to its new strategy to sell more chips directly to customers and to cut ties with some of its biggest distributors. But TI executives said that was not a factor and that its changes in distribution and having a more direct relationship with its customer \u201cyields more rewards than it does risk, and it gives us greater access to those customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cCustomers are just far more cautious than they were, certainly a year ago, but even 90 days ago, and many of them talk about the caution. They mention the trade tensions that we know have been happening, and have been kind of accumulating over the last three or four quarters,\u201d Lizardi said when asked for more details behind the new guidance.\n\nIf TI is an example, investors may have to let go of the notion of a near-term recovery, as this column has warned since a second-half rebound was originally suggested. Combined with disappointments from IBM Corp. IBM, +1.04% and Netflix Inc. NFLX, -4.09% last week, tech\u2019s earnings season has gotten off to a rocky start, and all eyes now move to Xilinx and Intel as they prepare to give more info on the chip sector later this week.", "description": "The recent run-up in semiconductor stocks may be finally ending, as Texas Instruments does not call a bottom to the downturn.", "authors": ["Therese Poletti"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT815_texasi_ZG_20191022203233.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
