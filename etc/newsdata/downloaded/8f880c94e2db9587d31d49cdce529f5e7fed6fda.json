REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov\n\nUnder the deal Sberbank will buy a 35% stake in MF Technologies, which owns 58.9% of Mail.ru\u2019s voting rights, from Gazprombank, a state-owned financial group.\n\nMF Technologies was set up by Megafon (MFON.MM), Gazprombank, Rostec and USM holdings in 2018 and holds a 5.2% stake in Mail.ru Group (MAILRq.L), while controlling a majority of its voting rights.\n\nGazprombank did not respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment.\n\nMail.ru\u2019s chief executive, Boris Dobrodeyev, said that the company welcomed the change to deepen ties with Sberbank, adding that he saw scope for wider cooperation.\n\nThe move would expand Sberbank\u2019s investments in the internet space and may put pressure on Yandex (YNDX.MM), Russia\u2019s largest internet company and Mail.ru rival.\n\nBut with investments in Yandex projects Yandex.Dengi, Yandex.Money and e-commerce venture Yandex.Market, Sberbank could find itself caught between the two industry leaders.\n\nSberbank is one of several Russian banks, including VTB Bank (VTBR.MM) and TCS Group (TCSq.L), to have invested in internet and telecom services as corporate demand for their traditional services slows.\n\nOwnership structure in Mail.ru - here\n\nVoting rights in Mail.ru - here\n\nThe deal would give Sberbank 1.82% ownership of Mail.ru and 20.3% of the voting rights, according to Reuters calculations.\n\nIn 2018, USM holdings and Megafon transferred control of their 54% voting stake in MF Technologies to Mail.ru\u2019s management, giving CEO Boris Dobrodeyev and his team a 31.8% voting share.\n\nIn July, Mail.ru and Sberbank announced that they would invest up to 64 million roubles ($1 million) in a new joint venture for taxi services and food, providing competition for Yandex, whose Yandex.Taxi service dominates Russia\u2019s ride-hailing market.\n\nAlfa Bank said it expected Mail.ru to benefit from the deal, saying its cooperation with Sberbank on digital projects and close ties at the ownership level would help to attract ambitious investment.\n\n\u201cSberbank as a long-term strategic partner will provide access to significant amounts of funding for new projects at the venture stage of development,\u201d said Alfa Bank in a note.\n\nFor Yandex, however, the move could prove to have negative consequences, according to Alfa Bank, with Sberbank cooperation in its Yandex.Market joint venture now looking more vulnerable.\n\nMail.ru operates email services, as well as Russian social media websites VKontakte and Odnoklassniki. In 2016, it purchased food delivery service Delivery Club, which is now co-owned by Sberbank as part of the companies\u2019 joint venture.\n\nThe group\u2019s shares were up 1.9% on the day, rising for the eighth consecutive session.\n\nA draft law that proposed limiting foreign shareholding in Russian internet firms at 20%, later revised to 50%, hit Mail.ru\u2019s share price this month, with the company\u2019s stock falling to its lowest since January 2017 on Oct. 18.\n\nThe share price has rebounded more than 20% since reaching that mark.", "description": "Sberbank has agreed to buy Gazprombank's holding stake in internet company Mail.ru as Russia's largest lender continues its transformation under Chief Executive German Gref into a banking-to-online services company.", "authors": ["Alexander Marrow", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446197597&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S146", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
