That effort has come alongside a crackdown on the business community and a silencing of political dissent.\n\nBankers have shown they are willing to move past the murder to win business in Saudi Arabia, but it is unclear whether large numbers of foreign investors are ready to bet on Prince Mohammed\u2019s vision. Foreign direct investment in Saudi Arabia remains meager and few international firms have placed big bets on the country since Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\nSenior-level bankers are expected to gather in Dubai on Thursday for the first meeting of the underwriting team, the people said. Aramco plans an IPO in two stages: first on the domestic Saudi stock market before pursuing an international debut next year or in 2021.\n\nJPMorgan, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Citi, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs all declined to comment on their involvement in the IPO.\n\nBank of America didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nWrite to Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com, Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Maureen Farrell at maureen.farrell@wsj.com", "description": "Global investment bankers launched the underwriting process for the initial public offering of Saudi oil giant Aramco, a sign financiers who shunned the kingdom after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi are turning the page.", "authors": ["Rory Jones", "Summer Said In Dubai", "Maureen Farrell In New York", "Summer Said", "Maureen Farrell", "Rory.Jones Wsj.Com", "Summer.Said Wsj.Com", "Maureen.Farrell Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106481/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
