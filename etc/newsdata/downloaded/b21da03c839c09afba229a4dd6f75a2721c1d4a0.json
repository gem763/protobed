Picture taken September 26, 2019. REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage\n\nThe suggestion that only black market vape products are connected to vape-related deaths and illness is entirely inaccurate, if you ask two lawyers representing the mother of 18-year-old David Wakefield who suffered from asthma and died while fighting a two-year addiction to Juul Labs Inc.'s nicotine e-cigarettes.\n\nAngela Nehmens and Mahzad Kazempour Hite filed what they say they believe is the first wrongful death lawsuit against e-cigarette giant, Juul Labs. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal district court for the Northern District of California, was brought by Wakefield\u2019s mother, Lisa Vail, on behalf of her son\u2019s estate.\n\n\u201cHe continued using Juul and he passed away in the middle of the night,\u201d Nehmens told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHis mom has described it to me as someone who came in the middle of the night and stole her son, because otherwise a healthy, active 18-year-old boy doesn't die out of nowhere. And we know that there are studies that demonstrate that Juul can cause asthma or exacerbate existing asthma.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not just asthma\u2019\n\nVail alleges that Juul caused her son\u2019s death by regularly inundating him with Juul advertisements and marketing materials that led him to believe the company\u2019s e-cigarettes were safe and did not pose any health risks. Nehmens said Wakefiled was not exhibiting any signs of asthma the day he died, and that his history of asthma was minor. An autopsy is underway. Wakefield\u2019s death certificate currently lists asthma as the cause of death.\n\nJuul can expect additional claims from plaintiffs who exclusively used its products.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just asthma,\u201d Nehmens said. \u201cWe have other clients who began using Juul when they were minors, who have been intubated. We have one woman who was hospitalized for 30 days after using Juul for three months. She was an exclusive Juul user, and so was Daniel.\u201d\n\nHite calls into question vape pen ingredients like propylene glycol, a synthetic liquid substance known as safe to ingest, and converts into the toxin formaldehyde when heated to a certain temperature.\n\n\u201cThese are things that should have been studied by Juul,\u201d Hite said.\n\nRoswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center toxicologist and associate professor of oncology, Maciej Goniewicz, told Yahoo Finance in September that formaldehyde is also present in some cigarette tobacco smoke. He raised concerns over solvents used to extract nicotine, and possibly THC.\n\n\u201cActually it\u2019s the heating of the nicotine solvent, not the nicotine itself, but propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin \u2014 those are the solvents for nicotine \u2014 and this is what creates this vapor effect. And these two chemicals if they are overheated, if temperatures go too high, then they decompose. And once they decompose, they create some of the toxic chemicals, and one of those toxic chemicals is formaldehyde.\u201d\n\n\u2018We are getting calls nearly every day\u2019\n\nThe lawyers say media reports and warnings from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concerning dangers associated with vaping have increased awareness and the number of allegedly injured parties seeking legal advice.\n\n\u201cWe have upwards of 100 clients and we are getting calls nearly every day,\u201d Nehmens said. \u201cWe know that these injuries are being seen in exclusively Juul users. They are not cigarette smokers, they're not using the vape pens for THC oil or anything like that.\u201d\n\nAs of October 8, the CDC confirmed 26 deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes, or vaping, and 1,299 lung injury cases.\n\nHite said that before 2018 when Juul was required by federal regulators to change its marketing materials and disclosures of potential harm, it had no warning and focused its marketing conversation on Juul as a safer alternative to cigarette smoke. Those types of statements, she said, made their way into Wakefield\u2019s Gmail inbox.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no actual scientific support for the statement,\u201d that Juul is a safer alternative to cigarette smoking, she said.\n\n\u201cThey created an epidemic of young users, most of who did not actually know that they were inhaling a product that even contained nicotine, so they couldn't appreciate the risk.\u201d\n\nThe multi-count complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages, plus an injunction that would prohibit acts by Juul that the court may conclude threaten injury to members of the public. Vail says Juul is responsible for product design defects, negligence, failure to warn of e-cigarette risks, failure to recall the products, fraudulent concealment of risks, and violations of the Unfair Competition Law Act.\n\nJuul did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
