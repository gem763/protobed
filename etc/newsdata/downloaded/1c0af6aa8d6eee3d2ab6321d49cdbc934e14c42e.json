That\u2019s about a player wanting to graft and show the other side of his game. Until he does that, he won\u2019t be in this new Arsenal team.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder Emery, the Gunners have enjoyed a promising start to the 2019-20 season and currently sit third in the Premier League, one point below defending champions Manchester City.\n\nKeown, who played under legendary manager Arsene Wenger, believes Emery has \u2018the tools\u2019 to become a success at the Emirates and get the club back into the Champions League.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not close enough to Emery to know how charismatic he is, what personality he has,\u2019 the former England defender added.\n\n\u2018He strikes me as being a thoroughly good guy, which is a good starting place. I think Emery\u2019s the right man to turn it round.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018He\u2019s had a good year now and I expect it to really pick up for the rest of the season.\n\n\u2018As long as the players take everything on board, and there\u2019s clear messages to the players, I think he has the tools to be successful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Maybe it goes over to the manager now, the pressure\u2019s on him to get the right balance, pick the right players, get behind them and put Arsenal back in the Champions League.\u2019\n\nMORE: The five Tottenham players Mauricio Pochettino is ready to sell in January", "description": "Martin Keown has told Mesut Ozil that only hard graft will win over Unai Emery and save his career at Arsenal.
