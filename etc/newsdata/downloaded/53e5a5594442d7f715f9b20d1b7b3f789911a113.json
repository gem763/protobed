The bill is expected to be signed into law and take effect January 1.\n\nBut Uber's chief legal officer, Tony West, told reporters on Wednesday that the bill \"does not automatically reclassify any (ride-hailing) drivers from independent contractors to employees,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWest argued that the bill raised the bar for workers to be considered contractors but that the ride-hailing giant cleared it, The Journal reported. Uber drivers are \"properly classified as independent,\" West reportedly said, adding that the firm would \"respond to claims of misclassification in arbitration and in court.\"\n\n\"AB5 does not provide drivers with benefits, nor does it give drivers the right to organize,\" he added, according to The Journal. \"In fact, the bill currently says nothing about ride-share drivers.\"\n\nUber and Lyft have previously downplayed the bill as a qualification of existing law, argued it would hurt workers by reducing flexibility, and claimed it would lead to customers paying more. Lyft has also said the bill would lower some of its costs and give it more control over drivers.\n\nRead more: California just passed a bill turning 'gig economy' workers into employees.
