A rough childhood, emotional neglect, abusive relationships or the fear of getting your heart broken might be a few. Here\u2019s a list of telltale signs that suggest that you\u2019ve been dodging Cupid. Can you relate? Read on.\n\nYou don\u2019t grieve your breakup\n\nIn order to have a healthy, growing relationship with your significant other, it is important to have fully recovered from your past breakup. Letting yourself feel sadness, loss and the absence of the person is an important tool in healing completely, which in turn helps you step into a new relationship without any baggage or unresolved emotions. If you have lingering feelings for your ex, know that it\u2019s probably one of the reasons why you\u2019re blocking out love.\n\nYou swing the casual way\n\nDo the walls of the room start closing in when someone mentions the word \u2018commitment\u2019? Do you prefer casual flings to a relationship? It\u2019s an obvious sign that you\u2019re avoiding love. There\u2019s nothing wrong with not wanting a serious relationship, but if you repel commitment by going for short-term affairs that you know will end soon enough, you\u2019re keeping love at bay. You are of the opinion that you\u2019re protecting your heart, but these flings can be quite desensitising in the long run. It\u2019s okay to indulge in light relationships if you\u2019ve just exited a relationship, but keeping your heart in a cage on purpose because you think you\u2019re protecting yourself might not be the best way to go through life.\n\nYou\u2019re constantly afraid that things will go downhill\n\nAnother red flag is entering a relationship with a negative mindset by believing that its another affair that is bound to go down in flames. This feeling has a domino effect that inevitably will lead to your relationship crumbling. If you already think that the relationship is going to end, you don\u2019t really bother opening up, confiding in that person or doing things to build the relationship. It\u2019s doomed from the beginning then, is it not?\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t practise self-love\n\nThe first step to a healthy relationship is loving yourself. If you love yourself, you hold yourself in high esteem and would never settle for anything less. For you, there would be no love without respect - the basis of a thriving, growing relationship. Therefore, it is essential to work on your relationship with yourself to have a relationship with another that is filled with the good stuff - love, affection and growth. If you can\u2019t comprehend the idea of self-love, you are keeping yourself from fully accepting love. Understand it and work on it, it all begins with self-acceptance, nurturing your emotions and giving yourself importance over other things.\n\nYou feel uncomfortable when complimented\n\nDo you instantly dismiss compliments given to you by your partner? Are these compliments met with disbelief and an immediate brush-off of \u201cWhat rubbish, don\u2019t lie\u201d? It\u2019s a glaring sign that you\u2019re blocking out love. Practise acceptance. Consider the compliment, offered to you by somebody who loves you for the amazing person you are, personality and all. Digest it and believe it, because every word rings true. It\u2019s one of the first steps you can take to loving yourself. How can you receive love, if you don\u2019t love yourself dearly first?", "description": "Do you have a tough time getting into relationships and maintaining them?
