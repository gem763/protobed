Oil theft cost Nigeria $1.35 bln, group urges legal task force\n\nABUJA, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Nigeria lost $1.35 billion to oil\n\ntheft in the first six months of this year and needs a legal\n\ntask force with special courts to tackle it, a government\n\ncommittee said on Thursday.\n\nThe committee, set up to investigate theft from the miles of\n\npipelines that snake through the country's swampy, oil-rich\n\nDelta region, said the theft will only grow if the government\n\ndoes not take special action to combat it.\n\nIn addition to a legal task force, with dedicated courts,\n\nprosecution teams and specially trained judges, it also said oil\n\npipeline maintenance and ownership needed to be restructured.\n\n\"The governance structure of the pipeline(s) is such today\n\nthat no one is held accountable...when these losses occur,\" the\n\ncommittee, chaired by Edo state governor Godwin Obaseki, said in\n\nits report.\n\nThe four primary pipelines lost 22.5 million barrels of oil\n\nin six months - roughly 6% of Nigeria's nearly 2 million barrels\n\nper day (bpd). The committee also cited a lack of fuel stations in most of\n\nthe oil-producing communities around the Niger Delta, which it\n\nsaid made them resort to oil theft and illegal refining.\n\nThe recommendations will go to President Muhammadu Buhari,\n\nwho control's the country's petroleum portfolio.", "description": "Oil theft cost Nigeria $1.35 bln, group urges legal task force", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEBBH09C_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
