If we can get to an agreement on Thursday or Friday, and if the House of Commons is about to vote in an indicative vote in favor of that agreement on Saturday, it may not be necessary to even consider an extension, but it\u2019s too early to make that assessment at this stage,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the Irish prime minister added that \u201cthere\u2019s a few hurdles to go over before we hit that point yet.\u201d\n\nThe British prime minister has a working majority of minus 45 in the Commons and would therefore require dozens of opposition MPs \u2014 as well as all his Conservatives \u2014 to vote for his deal in order for it to pass. Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal was defeated by 58 votes the third time it was put to MPs.\n\nAn extraordinary sitting of the Commons was planned for this Saturday but the U.K. government has said that events this week will determine whether it goes ahead. The sitting was intended to allow MPs to consider a Brexit deal, should one be agreed by the U.K. and EU leaders at the European Council summit later this week.\n\nGiving his latest assessment on the Brexit talks, Varadkar said \u201cthe initial indications are that we are making progress, that the negotiations are moving in the right direction.\u201d But he cautioned that \u201cthe gap was still quite wide\u201d on the customs issue. He added he had had a \"crazy day\" and the situation may have changed since he was last briefed a few hours earlier.\n\nNegotiations turned more positive following a meeting between the Irish prime minister and Johnson last week at a country estate in the northwest of England. Varadkar described the talks as \u201ca broad meeting of minds, a landing zone of minds.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually turning that into a legal agreement is a different thing and that\u2019s the kind of work that\u2019s under way,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I said last week was that I saw a pathway towards an agreement, but there\u2019s a difference between a pathway and an agreement.\u201d\n\nA No. 10 Downing Street spokesman said \u201ctalks are ongoing\u201d but there is still \u201ca long way to go.\u201d The spokesman declined to comment on the suggestion that the deal could be put forward for an indicative vote by MPs.", "description": "Irish prime minister says a deal is closer but there are \u2018a few hurdles\u2019 still to clear.", "authors": ["Eleni Courea"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1173385907-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
