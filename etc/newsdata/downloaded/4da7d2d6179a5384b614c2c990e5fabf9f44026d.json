It\u2019s been two days since Democrats announced they would pursue the impeachment of President Trump, and one day since the White House released call records showing Trump had urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to help find dirt on a political rival. Today, the acting director of national intelligence will testify, and there are already reports that the whistleblower complaint at the center of the Ukraine scandal has been declassified and will be released shortly. Here we go.\n\n6:33 a.m. Impeachment is legally prescribed by the Constitution, but political in practice and therefore made for TV. The judges and jurors all hold elected office. They answer to the American voters, most of whom have better things to do right now, like make breakfast and get their kids out the door. Morning Joe talks about Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) saying Wednesday that the whistleblower allegations against Trump are \u201cvery troubling.\u201d Fox and Friends plays clips of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) opposing President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment in 1998. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter about facts. It doesn\u2019t matter about truth,\u201d says Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) in an appearance on the show. He means that Democrats have no scruples.\n\n8:03 a.m. Starting the day at his Fifth Avenue penthouse, Trump fires off a fusillade of tweets, landing faster than they can be read. He wants people to know what his pundit friends, family and Republican operatives think. All seem to agree it is perfectly fine for Trump to ask Ukraine\u2019s leader to help the Justice Department and his personal attorney investigate a rival candidate for president, as the phone call summary revealed Wednesday. First daughter Ivanka Trump is proud of her president. Vice President Pence thinks Trump \u201chas been completely vindicated.\u201d Former daytime talk show host Geraldo Rivera suggests Trump\u2019s reelection is now more likely. \u201cSTICK TOGETHER, PLAY THEIR GAME, AND FIGHT HARD REPUBLICANS. OUR COUNTRY IS AT STAKE!\u201d reads one Trump tweet, which is later deleted.\n\n8:41 a.m. The House Intelligence Committee drops the whistleblower repo rt. The complaint confirms, with detailed notation, the outlines of charges Democrats have leveled against Trump. The central allegation is that the president is \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d In a new disclosure, the document describes a political effort by unnamed senior White House officials to \u201clock down\u201d all records of the phone call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president by moving paper records to a \u201ccodeword-level\u201d computer system. It also describes separate alleged efforts by the Trump administration to get Ukraine to \u201cplay ball\u201d in the spring. It provides a detailed analysis of the internal Ukrainian politics Trump has allegedly been trying to manipulate for months.\n\n9:13 a.m. As everyone struggles to make sense of the document, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) opens a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee. The witness is Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, who previously decided not to give the whistleblower report to Congress, as the law seemingly requires, after consulting the White House and Justice Department. Schiff wears his serious face. He says the Trump call to Ukraine \u201cread like a classic organized crime shakedown.\u201d Then, instead of reading from the document, he decides to dramatize it with made up words from an imaginary mob boss. \u201cI\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good,\u201d Schiff says. \u201cI want you to make up dirt on my political opponent understand.\u201d This is, Schiff says, \u201cthe most consequential form of tragedy.\u201d\n\n9:22 a.m. The committee\u2019s ranking Republican, Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), congratulates Democrats on the \u201crollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president.\u201d He talks about the \u201cDemocrat\u2019s mania to overturn the 2016 elections,\u201d and uses the words \u201choax,\u201d \u201cfake story,\u201d \u201chysteria,\u201d \u201cfrenzy,\u201d \u201cgambit,\u201d \u201ccharade,\u201d and \u201cgrotesque spectacle.\u201d He also falsely asserts that former vice president Joe Biden \u201cbragged that he extorted the Ukrainians into firing a prosecutor who happened to be investigating Biden\u2019s own son.\u201d Biden did push to fire a prosecutor who had previously investigated a firm on where his son, Hunter Biden, worked. But Biden and other Western officials said the prosecutor was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. The investigation into the firm was dormant at the time and Hunter Biden had not been accused of wrongdoing, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\n9:29 a.m. Maguire describes his work history, taking note that he has 11 times sworn an oath to the Constitution. \u201cNo one can take an individual\u2019s integrity away,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can only be given away.\u201d Then he explains two reasons that he did not give the whistleblower complaint to Congress, after consulting with the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel and the White House. First, he said he was advised by the Justice Department that it could contain privileged information about the internal workings of the executive branch. Second, there was a question of whether the complaint fell inside his purview because it concerned behavior by the president who is \u201coutside the intelligence community.\u201d At the same time, he is pleased that the information is now public. He says the whistleblower has behaved lawfully and \u201cacted in good faith.\u201d\n\n9:44 a.m. For the next several hours, Maguire takes questions from members of Congress, most of which consist of efforts by Republicans or Democrats to score points for their teams.\n\n11:18 a.m. Pelosi takes the stage at the Capitol building to announce that she is sad, prayerful and patriotic. She tries to put a headline on the now-released whistleblower report. \u201cThis is a coverup,\u201d she says, in reference to the claim that White House officials tried to move information to a highly classified computer system. She also says the acting director of national intelligence \u201cbroke the law\u201d by not immediately turning over the whistleblower complaint. Then she quotes Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Paine.\n\n11:45 a.m. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) takes the same stage before the same flags with another patriotic message. \u201cAmerica is too great for a vision so small of just impeachment and investigation,\u201d he says. He attacks Pelosi for opening an inquiry before the records of the call to the Ukrainian president were released. \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear \u2014 the president did not ask to investigate Joe Biden,\u201d McCarthy says. This is not clear at all. In the call summary released by the White House, Trump tells Ukraine\u2019s president, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.\u201d When a reporter points this out, McCarthy stands his ground. \u201cWhat you\u2019re reading and what you\u2019re trying to \u2014 my belief is you are misstating,\u201d McCarthy says.\n\n11:50 a.m. The Associated Press moves a story saying Vermont Gov. Phil Scott just declared himself the first Republican chief executive in the nation to support impeachment proceedings against Trump.\n\n12:47 p.m. The Los Angeles Times publishes a story quoting from a private speech Trump gave this morning at a New York hotel. In an audio recording taken from the room, Trump calls reporters \u201cscum\u201d and attacks the unidentified whistleblower, suggesting that he has committed a crime historically punished by death. \u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Trump says in the recording. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\n12:48 p.m. The cable networks start showing a hallway news conference by Schiff, just as Air Force One, carrying the president back from New York, makes its final approach at Joint Base Andrews. Trump immediately tweets, \u201cAdam B. Schiff has no credibility. Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party!\u201d On television, Schiff says his team will keep working on Trump\u2019s impeachment over the next two weeks, when the rest of Congress heads home for a recess.\n\n12:52 p.m. A reporter at the Capitol asks Schiff about Trump\u2019s four-minute-old, in-flight insult tweet. \u201cI\u2019m always flattered when I\u2019m attacked by someone of the president\u2019s character,\u201d Schiff says, before ducking into an office.\n\n1 p.m. With Schiff off television, Trump steps off the plane to address reporters. \u201cAdam B. Schiff doesn\u2019t talk about Joe Biden and his son walking away with millions of dollars from Ukraine, and then millions of dollars from China,\u201d Trump says. This is an inaccurate statement. Hunter Biden did collect significant income from a Ukrainian company, but there is no evidence Joe Biden made money from either country, and Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer denies that he made any money from a China investment deal he advised. Trump says three times that his call with the Ukrainian president was \u201cperfect.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely perfect phone call,\u201d he says.\n\n1:54 p.m. The New York Times reports that the whistleblower is a CIA officer who was detailed to the White House.\n\n2:21 p.m. The Washington Post updates its tally of House members who now support the opening of an impeachment inquiry. The new tally notches 219 Democrats and Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who announced this summer that he had left the Republican Party. A simple majority of 218 members is required to adopt articles of impeachment and prompt a Senate trial of the president.\n\n3:35 p.m. Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign releases a statement quoting the former vice president\u2019s appearance the night before on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d Biden said then that Trump\u2019s efforts were \u201c18 out of 10\u201d on the outlandish scale. Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, says Biden deserves indirect credit for Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. \u201cIt is all borne from his deep, fully substantiated fear that Joe Biden will beat him in November 2020,\u201d she says.\n\n3:44 p.m. CBS News announces that former secretary of state Hillary Clinton called Trump a \u201ccorrupt human tornado\u201d in a new interview. She supports an impeachment inquiry.\n\n4:28 p.m. Former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., a longtime critic of Trump, says on CNN that the president\u2019s morning comments comparing the whistleblower to a treasonous spy is \u201cwitness retaliation.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s really bad about it is this is going to have a very chilling effect on any other potential whistleblowers,\u201d Clapper says.", "description": "The whistleblower complaint goes public.
