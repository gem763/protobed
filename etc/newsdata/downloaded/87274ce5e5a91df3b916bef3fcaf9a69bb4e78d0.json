It also represents an unalloyed political victory for the Trump administration, which has come under fire of late for its decision to draw down the American presence in Syria.\n\nYet, however momentous, al-Baghdadi\u2019s death remains part of a larger struggle. Although ISIS is significantly diminished, it still possesses formidable strategic capabilities and resources that make it an enduring threat to the United States, as well as to America\u2019s interests and its regional allies.\n\nThe numbers tell the story.\n\nGlobal reach and business model\n\nAt its most powerful, ISIS was estimated to boast a force of 40,000 foreign fighters drawn from a multitude of nations (among them Russia, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia). Most of this cohort remains active today, despite the collapse of the ISIS caliphate. As of early this year, the U.S. government gauged that the group still had 20,000 to 30,000 active fighters at its disposal. These forces, in turn, will be bolstered in the years ahead by a new generation of radicals that is now being incubated in enclaves like Syria\u2019s notorious al-Hawl refugee camp.\n\nEditorial Board: ISIS leader\u2019s demise is a triumph for civilization over barbarity\n\nISIS also retains a truly global reach. In fact, over the past year, as its Middle Eastern caliphate has declined, the terror group has succeeded in repositioning itself to other global theaters \u2014 with ominous results. ISIS cells and affiliates are active today throughout Africa and Southeast Asia, where they pose a growing threat to the stability of countries like Nigeria, Indonesia and the Philippines. Indeed, the group may even be poised for a comeback in the Middle East.\n\nPresident Donald Trump with, from left, national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, Vice President Mike Pence, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen.

More\n\nIn its report on \u201cOperation Inherent Resolve,\u201d as the campaign against the Islamic State is formally known, the Pentagon\u2019s Office of the Inspector General reiterated that in the absence of continued military pressure on the group from the United States, ISIS remains capable of reclaiming lost territory in Syria within as little as six months to a year.\n\nIn terms of finances, too, ISIS remains a potent force. At the height of its power, the Islamic State ranked as the best-funded threat group in history, thanks to a sophisticated business model that revolved around multiple revenue streams ranging from oil sales to looting to the taxation of territories under its control. Not much has changed in this regard either. Despite the collapse of its territorial control, experts estimate that ISIS still has access to hundreds of millions of dollars and continues to generate a steady stream of revenue through informal networks and illicit activities. These funds, in turn, have enabled it to continue funding global operations on an ongoing basis.\n\nOutreach to Muslim hearts and minds\n\nMost of all, the Islamic State\u2019s corrosive ideological message remains as enduring, and as appealing, as ever. Counterterrorism experts and officials caution that there has been no discernible change to patterns of recruitment and radicalization in the broader Muslim world over the past year. They also note that the organization\u2019s outreach \u2014 carried out through a sophisticated apparatus that adroitly exploits social media, online propaganda and new technology \u2014 means that it remains a formidable force in the most important arena of all: the struggle for \u201chearts and minds\u201d taking place in the Muslim world.", "description": "Trump administration should not be tempted to consider its mission accomplished.
