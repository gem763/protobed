Even a week's outage of affected supplies could add $3-$5 per barrel of a risk premium, while anything beyond six weeks could drive the London Brent contract above $75 a barrel, the analysts said.\n\nSaudi Arabian officials are weighing Aramco's initial public offering, after the attacks on the company's largest oil facilities, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIn response to potential shortages caused by the attacks, President Donald Trump provided some relief late Sunday by authorizing the release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve if needed to stabilize energy markets.\n\nShale-oilfield drillers including Pioneer Natural Resources and Continental Resources, rallied as executives indicated to The Wall Street Journal they would maintain, but not lift, production in the wake of the attacks.\n\nWrite to Rob Curran at rob.curran@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 16, 2019 16:23 ET (20:23 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
