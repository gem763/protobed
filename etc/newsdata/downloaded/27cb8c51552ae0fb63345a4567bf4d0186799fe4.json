The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the arrests, said that Parnas and Fruman had donated to Trump\u2019s campaign as well as a pro-Trump super PAC.\n\nRudy Giuliani has coffee with Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 20, 2019.

Nachmanoff.\n\nU.S. Attorney Geoff Berman said at a press conference Thursday that Parnas and Fruman both had one-way international tickets when they were arrested, and that the investigation is ongoing. Giuliani had lunch with the duo at the Trump International Hotel just hours before their scheduled flight, according to the Journal.\n\nSeparately on Thursday, House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry into Trump issued subpoenas to Parnas and Fruman demanding documents related to their work with Giuliani. Before the two were arrested, House investigators had requested that Parnas appear for a deposition Thursday, and Fruman for one on Friday, but their counsel said Tuesday that they would decline.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Parnas and Fruman committed to raising more than $20,000 for a sitting U.S. congressman, and that Parnas \u201cmet with Congressman-1 and sought Congressman-1\u2032s assistance in causing the U.S. Government to remove or recall the then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongressman-1\u201d is former Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), who sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking for Marie Yovanovitch to be removed as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine after his meeting with Parnas, according to the Texas Observer.\n\nLev Parnas meets with then-Rep.
