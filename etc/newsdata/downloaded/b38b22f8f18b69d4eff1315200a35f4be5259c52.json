(AP) - Tom Brady had two touchdown runs and moved ahead of Peyton Manning for second place on the NFL's all-time passing yards list as the New England Patriots pulled away for a 35-14 victory over the New York Giants on Thursday night.\n\nThe reigning Super Bowl champion Patriots also returned a blocked punt for a touchdown and forced four turnovers, including a fumble return for a score, to move to 6-0 for the first time since time since 2015.\n\nBrady finished 31 of 41 for 334 yards and an interception. Julian Edelman had his second straight 100-yard receiving game, catching nine passes for 113 yards. Giants rookie Daniel Jones had three interceptions on the night, finishing 15 of 31 for 161 yards.\n\nNew England has now won 19 straight games against a first or second-year quarterback, the longest streak in NFL history.\n\nDespite struggling to move the ball for most of the game, New York (2-4) had the ball trailing 21-14 with 8:43 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nJones completed a pass to running back Jon HIlliman, who was hit in the backfield by Patriots linebacker Jamie Collins, forcing a fumble. Kyle Van Noy recovered, sprinted 22 yards and stretched the ball to the pylon for the touchdown .\n\nNew England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, left, celebrates his touchdown with Gunner Olszewski after scoring on a quarterback sneak in the second half of an NFL football game against the New York Giants, Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019, in Foxborough, Mass. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)\n\nIt was part of an error-filled game by both offenses, who entered the night dealing with key injuries\n\nThe Giants were missing three of their top playmakers. Running back Saquon Barkley sat a third straight game because of a sprained right ankle, tight end and leading receiver Evan Engram was inactive with a knee injury and receiver Sterling Shepard was in the concussion protocol. Barkley's backup Wayne Gallman also sat with a concussion.\n\nThe Patriots played without running back Rex Burkhead, who missed his second straight game with a foot injury. Receiver Phillip Dorsett was inactive, also with an injured foot.\n\nAs a result, both teams had issues executing and hanging onto the ball.\n\nJones was confused at times by the Patriots' coverages, contributing to his turnovers. And Brady, in addition to his interception, had a fumble that was returned for a touchdown.\n\nThe Patriots moved swiftly on the opening drive, getting to the Giants 19. But Sony Michel was stopped for no gain on fourth-and-1.\n\nNew England took over in Giants territory for its third possession after Stephon Gilmore deflected a pass by Jones that was intercepted by John Simon. The Patriots gave the ball right back on the first play after the changeover when Janoris Jenkins picked off Brady's pass intended for Edelman.\n\nNew England broke the stalemate late in the first quarter when Riley Dixon's punt from the 6-yard line was blocked by Brandon Bolden and scooped up by Chase Winovich, who ran it in for the touchdown.\n\nThe Patriots then got the game's first offensive score on their sixth touch of the night when Brandon Bolden capped a five-play, 20-yard drive with a 1-yard run.\n\nThe Giants bounced back on their ensuing possession, with Jones connecting on a deep pass to Golden Tate, who sprinted for a 64-yard touchdown. It was the first passing TD given up by the Patriots this season.\n\nThe Patriots were just three plays into their next drive when Lorenzo Carter dragged down Brady for a 9-yard sack. Brady fumbled the ball, which was picked up by Markus Golden and returned 42 yards for a touchdown.\n\nPatriots receiver Josh Gordon injured his left knee on the play while trying to tackle Golden. Gordon got caught under a tangle of players and got his left leg pinned underneath him. He needed assistance as he limped off the field.\n\nBut New England figured things out just before the half, getting a 1-yard run by Brady that capped an 11-play, 75-yard drive to put the Patriots ahead 21-14.\n\nINJURIES\n\nGiants: DL Olsen Pierre left in the second quarter with a concussion.\n\nPatriots: S Patrick Chung left in the first quarter with a chest injury. ...
