Highs: 65 to 70.\n\nTonight: Increasing clouds. Lows: 50 to 55.\n\nTomorrow: Showers likely, especially in the afternoon. Highs: 65 to 70.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post headquarters.\n\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\n\nThis final full week of October offers several splendid fall days, but also two solid opportunities for needed rain. We\u2019re slowly but surely eating away at this drought. Temperatures this week are pretty uniform, with highs mostly in the 60s and lows in the 40s and 50s \u2014 pretty close to normal.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device.

After starting the day near 50, afternoon highs climb well into the 60s, perhaps touching 70 in our milder spots. Winds are light. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTonight: Clouds gradually increase ahead of the next approaching storm system. Overnight lows settle between 50 and 55. Light winds from the southeast. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Gridlock. Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend...\n\nTomorrow (Tuesday): Clouds lower and thicken, with a slight chance (20 to 40 percent, highest chances west and southwest) of showers in the morning. Shower chances increase (to about 80 percent areawide) as the afternoon wears on, and some heavier downpours are possible. Winds from the south help temperatures climb well into the 60s, although they\u2019ll step back once showers begin. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Some showers are possible early in the evening, but the window for rain is fairly short with this fast-moving storm front. Rainfall totals probably average between 0.25 and 0.5 inches, but locally higher amounts are possible. Gradual clearing overnight and cooler, with lows in the 40s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nWednesday and Thursday are both beautiful October days with clear, crisp mornings and sunny, mild afternoons. Highs in the mid-60s Wednesday warm to the upper 60s Thursday. Lows Thursday are chilly, with some frosty 30s in our colder areas to the mid-40s downtown. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFriday may bring some increasing clouds, but should still be a pretty pleasant day. After lows in the 40s, highs reach the 60s. Some showers are possible Friday night, with lows near 50. Confidence: Medium\n\nWe\u2019re confident another storm system will affect the region over the weekend, but the timing is a huge wild card. The American model favors rain early Saturday, but then clearing by the second half of the day and remaining dry Sunday. The European model predicts a much slower developing situation. It forecasts dry conditions through Saturday afternoon but rain likely Saturday night and Sunday. Highs both days should average near 60 (add a few degrees if it\u2019s dry, subtract a few degrees if it\u2019s rainy) with lows near 50.
