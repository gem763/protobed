This has made it a fertile ground for democracy but also left it a highly fractured nation with an ever shifting constellation of feuding power-brokers who often look to foreigners for help in their internal struggles.\n\nThe whistle-blower\u2019s complaint released on Thursday revealed how Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, played into this dynamic, focusing his efforts to get Mr. Biden and his son investigated on a group of senior law-enforcement officials in Ukraine who had been locked for months in a bitter turf war with rival factions within the same state structure.\n\nThe officials Mr. Giuliani sought out in the name of fighting corruption were engaged in a long feud with Ukraine\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Bureau. The bureau, which has worked closely with the F.B.I. and was set up in 2014 with strong support from the Obama administration, is one of the few government agencies in Ukraine that Western diplomats in Kiev view as reasonably honest and competent.\n\nMr. Giuliani has his own business history in the country as well. More than two years ago, his company, Giuliani Security and Safety, signed a contract with a wealthy Ukrainian, Pavel Fuks, to consult on emergency planning in Mr. Fuks\u2019s hometown, Kharkiv.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Fuks and others had become entangled in a complicated $1.5 billion deal to buy Ukrainian government bonds. In an investigation, Al Jazeera reported that the real sellers were sanctioned former insiders in the government of the disgraced former president of Ukraine, Viktor F. Yanukovych.", "description": "Caught between East and West, it is a place that attracts adventurers and carpetbaggers, who return home with \u201clegacies, memories and skeletons for their closets.\u201d", "authors": ["Andrew Higgins"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/28/world/28-why-ukraine-PRINT-01/27why-ukraine1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
