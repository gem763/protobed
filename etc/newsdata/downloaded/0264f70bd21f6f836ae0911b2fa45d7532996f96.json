The AL Central-leading Twins, who had won seven of eight, fell to 5\u00bd games ahead of second-place Cleveland in the division.\n\nBetts homered into the first row of the Green Monster seats on the first pitch of the game from Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos (11-8), then sent one out of the ballpark with two on in the second to make it 4-0. Betts added a single down the third base line in the fourth - after taking a pitch - and hit an RBI single in the sixth, also on the second pitch of the at-bat.\n\nHe came up again in the eighth and made his only out, on a line drive back at the mound that pitcher Brusdar Graterol caught before it hit him in the gut.\n\nFollowing a 47-minute rain delay before the first pitch, Rodriguez (17-5) struck out eight while walking four and hitting a batter to add to what was already a career high in wins. The Red Sox are 12-1 when he starts at Fenway Park, and 10-2 in his last 12 starts overall.\n\nRyan Brasier relieved Rodriguez to start the eighth and immediately gave up a single to Nelson Cruz and a two-run homer to Eddie Rosario. Minnesota put two on with one out in the ninth against Darwinzon Hernandez before Brandon Workman got a game-ending 1-4-3 double play for his 11th save.\n\nBerr\u00edos pitched five-plus innings, allowing six runs on eight hits and three walks while striking out six. It was the second-most runs he\u2019s allowed this season.\n\nPLAYING BY THE SEAT OF THEIR PANTS\n\nTwins catcher Willians Astudillo threw out Mitch Moreland from one knee on a dribbler in front of the plate in the second inning.\n\nBerr\u00edos did even better, diving to stop Andrew Benintendi\u2019s checked-swing nubber down the third base line in the fifth, and throwing from one knee as he fell away from the play. He wound up flat on his back before third baseman Miguel San\u00f3 came over to congratulate him, putting his arm around the pitcher as they walked off the field together.\n\nPLAYING 21\n\nThe Red Sox had 21 pitchers on the roster for the game, with 17 of them in the bullpen in case they were needed. They used five pitchers in all.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going winter ball style,\u201d manager Alex Cora said. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s not perfect, but our starters are not giving us enough. We need matchups. We need arms.\u201d\n\nMajor League Baseball allows teams to expand their rosters as of Sept. 1, and Boston\u2019s Triple-A team finished its season on Tuesday night. The rules are changing in 2020 to allow for more limited call-ups, but for now, Cora said, \u201cThe rules are the rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext year you can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not the first time it\u2019s happened in the game.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nTwins: RHP Sam Dyson (biceps soreness) has returned to the Twin Cities. He was on the 10-day injured list in August for the same problem. \u2026 INF Marwin Gonzalez (abdomen) is not yet ready to return, manager Rocco Baldelli said. Gonzalez has not played since Aug. 27. \u2026 Max Kepler (upper chest soreness) left in the seventh.\n\nRed Sox: INF Michael Chavis (left shoulder sprain), on the IL since Aug. 12, was scheduled to swing a bat.\n\nPlate umpire Ramon DeJesus took a pitch off his left hand with one out in the top of the ninth, sending his pitch counter flying. He called for a trainer, but stayed in the game. Meanwhile, second base umpire CB Bucknor had gone to the umpire\u2019s room to put on a chest protector and the game resumed without him.\n\nHe missed the rest of that at-bat but returned for the next one.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTwins: LHP Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez (9-6) pitches the series finale Thursday night.\n\nRed Sox: RHP Nathan Eovaldi (1-0) starts for the Red Sox.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mookie Betts homered on the first two pitches he saw, collecting four hits and five RBIs in all, and Eduardo Rodriguez allowed only five singles in seven shutout innings Wednesday night to help the Boston Red Sox beat the Minnesota Twins 6-2.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jimmy Golen"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/twins_red_sox_baseball_21695_c0-183-4373-2732_s1770x1032.jpg?bfd761acde5ad0e90a83598d2e266cdcd701173b"}
