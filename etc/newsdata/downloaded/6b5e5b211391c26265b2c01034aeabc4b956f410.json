And one-day shipping isn\u2019t on the list.\n\n\u201cIf you forgot to shop for Christmas and it's December 24th, Amazon is a wonderful solution to solve that problem,\u201d Yurcisin, who became Zulilly\u2019s president last year, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cBut for most other problems where you have a bit more patience, where you can plan for an event, there is a significant amount of savings that customers can have.\u201d\n\nZulily (QRTEA) launched a \u201cBest Price Promise\u201d program on Wednesday, which displays prices from Amazon and Walmart on its own product page. It pledges to beat the two major competitors\u2019 prices through the program, which tracks prices based on the item\u2019s Universal Product Code (UPC).\n\nWhile price match programs and tools to help customers track prices across sites are not uncommon, it\u2019s rare for a retailer to show a competitor's price directly it on its page. Zulily\u2019s business model and shipping strategy enable it to transfer bigger savings to consumers, Yurcisin said on YFi AM.\n\n\u201cWe really believe it's not just a majority but almost all the time we will have the lowest price,\u201d Yurcisin said. \u201cSo we believe by being transparent with customers and sharing this information, it is the first step.\u201d\n\n3 to 5 days is \u201csufficient\u201d\n\nZulily's new Price Promise program allows customers to compare its prices with those of Amazon and Walmart.

Unlike Amazon or Walmart, it doesn\u2019t stock much inventory. Instead, when a consumer places an order, vendors and brands ship products in pallets to Zulily.\n\nThis helps the Seattle-based retailer to eliminate costs tied to overstock and liquidations. But it also means customers need to wait longer for Zulily to receive products and ship individual items out. Now it takes about two weeks for customers to receive their Zulily order.\n\nYurcisin says while the company has made investments to shorten the wait, he learned from customers that not everyone needs one-day shipping.\n\n\u201cWe see millions of households have been willing to trade one and two-day shipping for more value and an opportunity,\u201d Yurcisin said.\n\nClose-up image of a woman buying Christmas present online. More\n\nStarted by Amazon and followed soon by Walmart, one-day shipping promises have become a new standard smaller e-commerce players try to match. Even startups are investing to ship products faster. Verishop, an e-commerce site co-founded by a former Amazon executive Cate Khan, offered free one-day shipping two months after its launch in June.\n\nBuilding the one-day shipping capability is not cheap. In the second quarter alone, Amazon invested over $800 million in the initiative. Yurcisin said many customers are not necessarily aware of the hidden cost tied to ultra-fast shipping.\n\nZulily has been under pressure this year for declining new users and lower average user spending. In the latest quarter, its revenue declined by 13% to $363 million. It has laid off an undisclosed number of employees as part of broader structural changes within the company, Geekwire reported in July.\n\nIn a call with analysts in August, Michael George, CEO of Curate Retail, Zulily\u2019s parent company, said the company\u2019s retail business hasn\u2019t seen much impact from Amazon\u2019s one-day shipping. He says sites like Zulily will work to expedite deliveries and it\u2019s \u201csufficient\u201d if the company ships the item in 3 to 5 days.", "description": "E-commerce site Zulily believes it can offer bigger savings for consumers without one-day shipping.
