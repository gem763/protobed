It would also place new responsibilities on doctors to notify police if they believe a gun owner shouldn\u2019t have a license due to concerns over the owner\u2019s mental health.\n\nThe government hopes lawmakers will approve the legislation by the end of the year.\n\nThe proposed measures come after New Zealand in April rushed through legislation to ban assault weapons such as AR-15 style rifles.\n\nThe government has launched a buyback scheme to compensate gun owners for the outlawed semi-automatics, and has so far collected about 19,000 weapons and 70,000 parts. The gun buyback and a parallel gun amnesty run until December.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Christchurch the focus remained on preventing another attack like the one on March 15. She said the attack exposed weaknesses in gun laws, which the government was fixing.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely recognize there is a legitimate need in our communities to be able to access guns, particularly our rural community,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cBut what these changes do is recognize that actually there\u2019s a real responsibility that comes with gun ownership.\u201d\n\nArdern has previously made the point that New Zealand has a different view on guns than the U.S., where gun ownership is seen as a constitutional right and is interpreted by many to be a defense against potential government overreach.\n\n\u201cOwning a firearm is a privilege not a right,\u201d Ardern said on Friday.\n\nBrenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old Australian white supremacist, has pleaded not guilty to terrorism, murder and attempted murder charges following the March attacks. He remains in jail ahead of his trial.\n\nThe judge in the case this week agreed to a request by prosecutors to delay the start of the trial by a month until next June to avoid a clash with the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.\n\nJudge Cameron Mander noted that many of the witnesses are Muslim and that defense lawyers hadn\u2019t raised any objections to the delay.", "description": "The bill comes six months after a gunman killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7b5f2c2400002e2a7943ec.jpeg?cache=2lmswx1wh1&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
