It also requires providers to refer patients for prenatal counseling, and it prohibits clinics that receive federal money from sharing office space with abortion providers - a requirement that would force some of the clinics to undergo expensive remodels, hire additional staff and install separate record-keeping systems.\n\nThe states and health organizations have raised several issues. They say the ban on abortion referrals violates requirements that federally funded pregnancy counseling be \u201cnondirective\u201d - that it provide neutral facts about pregnancy options. Further, they say that Health and Human Services offered no real rationale for its decision, and thus violated the law about decision-making by federal agencies.\n\nAbortion opponents have long criticized Title X, saying it subsidizes abortion providers even if the federal money does not go directly to abortion providers, and they\u2019ve celebrated the new requirements.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the Final Rule would make it more costly for Title X-funded programs to provide abortion services only proves that the Rule is warranted and well-justified,\u201d the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group, argued in a court brief.\n\nBut the clinics argue that there is no evidence that federal money is subsidizing abortion providers. There are strict requirements for spending and record-keeping to ensure that, they say.\n\nThe administration argues that the rule is supported by Supreme Court precedent and is in keeping with the language of the 1970 Title X law, which bars the money from being used in clinics where \u201cabortion is a method of family planning.\u201d It also points to similar rules that were adopted in 1988 and subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court. Under the Clinton administration, those rules were abandoned in favor of a requirement that the clinics provide neutral abortion counseling and referrals upon request.\n\nSome of the judges, including Milan Smith Jr. and Kim Wardlaw, questioned how they could rule against the government when the Supreme Court had previously upheld similar rules.\n\n\u201cI realize the regulation is a little bit different, but the concept is very clear: The Supreme Court says this is OK,\u201d Smith said.\n\nHarlow responded that the legal landscape and the agency\u2019s rationale were different in the earlier case, 1991\u2019s Rust v. Sullivan decision; just because the Supreme Court accepted that rationale earlier doesn\u2019t mean it would now, she suggested.\n\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General Hashim Mooppan argued that the ban on abortion referrals did not violate any requirement that pregnancy counseling be neutral. He suggested that a \u201creferral\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily part of \u201ccounseling,\u201d and even if it were, requiring a health care provider to be silent when it comes to making abortion referrals isn\u2019t the same as encouraging a patient to keep the baby.\n\nThat drew some derision from the judges.\n\n\u201cCommon sense suggests that when you go to a doctor and the doctor gives you advice, one part of that is going to be recommendations or a suggestion you see somebody,\u201d Judge Ricardo Paez told him. \u201cThey give you a referral.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are legally different concepts,\u201d Mooppan said. \u201cReferrals can occur during counseling but that doesn\u2019t mean they are one and the same.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear how soon the court might rule. If the court blocks the administration\u2019s policy, Planned Parenthood and other organizations that have dropped out of Title X might once again apply for grants.\n\nIn the meantime, the government is planning to redistribute to other Title X providers the grants those organizations have abandoned.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An appeals court is considering whether to block a Trump administration rule that bans taxpayer-funded health clinics from referring patients for an abortion - a rule that has already prompted many providers, including Planned Parenthood, to leave a longstanding federal family planning program.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gene Johnson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/trump_family_planning_73571_c0-232-8176-4999_s1770x1032.jpg?27f31778aacef98050fa8cc023498bc4e59f79f8", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
