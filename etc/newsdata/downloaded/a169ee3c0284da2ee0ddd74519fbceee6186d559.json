Sete Brasil creditors approve sale of rigs to UK's Magni Partners - sources\n\nBy Aluisio Alves\n\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Creditors of Brazilian oil platforms and rigs maker Sete Brasil have approved the sale of four oil exploration rigs to British company Magni Partners, two sources familiar with the deal told Reuters on Friday.\n\nThe rigs sold are named Urca, Frade, Arpoador and Guarapari. The four rigs have a 10-year leasing contract with Petrobras (SA: ), which will pay $299,000 per day for each rig when operational, one of the sources said.\n\nThe sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had no information regarding total value of the deal. A representative of Magni Partners could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nSete Brasil, which is under bankruptcy protection, was created in 2010 with the aim of building 29 rigs for the exploration of a prolific pre-salt oil region in Brazil. But lower oil prices and a corruption investigation that engulfed Petrobras ended by hurting those plans.\n\nAmong Sete's main creditors are local banks Banco do Brasil (SA: ), Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal, Ita\u00fa BBA and Santander (MC: ) Brasil (SA: ).", "description": "Sete Brasil creditors approve sale of rigs to UK's Magni Partners - sources", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC1A050_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
