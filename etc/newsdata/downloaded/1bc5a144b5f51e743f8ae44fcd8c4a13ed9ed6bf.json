For both teams, their exuberance on and off the field has been propelled by the joy often seen in Latin baseball culture. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In the moments after the Houston Astros salvaged their season, Carlos Correa sought his running mate on the left side of the infield for a chat.\n\nCertainly, the Astros\u2019 4-1 victory over the Washington Nationals in Game 3 of the World Series kept their championship hopes in the realm of the realistic. It showed they could hit \u2013 at least a little bit \u2013 with runners in scoring position and lean on their bullpen for nearly five innings of shutout work.\n\nYet since the start of the American League Championship Series, there\u2019s been a gnawing sense that the Astros have been playing a man down, that their heartbeat has been off a tick, and that a 107-win team has been out of rhythm and lacking the panache that put them within reach of a second championship in three years.\n\nSo Correa summoned Alex Bregman and played hype man.\n\nThe Astros won the ALCS largely without meaningful offensive contributions from Bregman, and despite a Game 2 homer, he\u2019s been nearly AWOL in this Series, too: One hit in 13 at-bats, and 4-for-31 (a .129 average) since the start of the ALCS.\n\nThat probably must change if the Astros are to erase this 2-1 deficit and vanquish the nettlesome Nationals. They are convinced that it will.\n\n\u201cI talked to him,\u201d said Correa after Bregman went 0-for-5 and stranded six baserunners, \u201cand I told him, \u2018Today is a positive day for you. A, because we won, and B, because tomorrow, you\u2019re going to crush.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t contain that guy for long. He\u2019s one of the best players in the game, one of the best hitters in the game.\n\n\u201cMark my words \u2014 tomorrow, he\u2019s going to go off.\u201d\n\nAlex Bregman went 1-for-13 in the first three games of the World Series. (Photo: Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nGame 4 couldn\u2019t be a better time for a Bregman revival. They will start rookie Jose Urquidy in a bullpen game, taking as many innings as they can from the right-hander before turning it over to a relief corps that retired 13 of 17 batters faced in Game 3.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough way to live, especially when your cleanup hitter is doing anything but.\n\nAnd while their third baseman was far from his standard Brash Bregman after his latest oh-fer, there was a glimmer of hope.\n\nAfter a first-inning strikeout that stranded George Springer at second, Bregman got the ball in play his next four trips up \u2014 hard.\n\n\u201cI hit four balls over 95 mph or something,\u201d Bregman said, and if a player is aware his exact exit velocities just minutes after the game, perhaps that\u2019s a sign he\u2019s a bit concerned, no?\n\nAnd he was pretty much right on: A drive to center in the third inning at 93.9 mph, a smash to left field at 97.4 mph in the fifth, a 102-mph forceout in the sixth and a 99-mph lineout to short in the ninth, to be exact.\n\nSOTO: 21st birthday didn't go as planned for Nationals phenom\n\nGAME 5: Trump plans late arrival for Sunday game\n\nThe sixth-inning at-bat marked something of an indignity \u2014 after Michael Brantley burned them for a pair of RBI singles earlier in the game, the Nationals opted to walk Dr. Smooth intentionally to load the bases for Bregman.\n\nBregman grounded to short, and thus wasn\u2019t in much position to chirp about it postgame.\n\nBut the Nationals\u2019 maneuver did not go unnoticed by the Astros, who know they play better when their MVP \u2014 perhaps the AL\u2019s MVP, too \u2014 is cooking.\n\nAnd maybe a bit angry.\n\n\u201cWe'll go home tonight wanting somebody to intentionally walk in front of him again,\u201d manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cHe'll carry that with him.\u201d\n\nFriday was more about baby steps. Bregman said the Astros \u201cstopped the bleeding\u201d with the Game 3 triumph and sounded a tone more Belichick than Bregs in calling it \u201ca good team win. And on to tomorrow.\u201d\n\nA tomorrow that looks a lot better now.\n\n\u201cIf we get that game tomorrow,\u201d says Correa, \u201cit\u2019s going to get interesting. We needed to get our swagger back, and I feel like we got it today. We\u2019re too talented, we\u2019ve come too far, too deep into the season to give up now.\u201d\n\nThe task is far simpler if the sinkhole in the middle of the order gets patched. Bregman said he felt \u201cnot great, but good,\u201d and at the least, a Game 3 win bought he and the Astros a Game 5, two shots to take this back to Texas.\n\nBy then, they fully expect their MVP to look the part.\n\n\u201cI'm not worried about Alex. You saw what he did. He's a great player,\u201d Brantley said. \u201cHe'll find his breaks. I can't wait to see him come out tomorrow. I'm ready.\n\n\u201cYou be ready, too.\u201d", "description": "Houston won Game 3 despite the struggling Bregman leaving six on base in an 0-for-5 showing.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published A.M.
