Penalties handed down to corporate polluters last year were the lowest in over a decade.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s executive orders mandates agencies post all guidance documents on how they handle their enforcement on a searchable website, otherwise the guidance will be considered withdrawn.\n\nUnder the other order, businesses or individuals found to be in non-compliance would be given \"an opportunity to be heard\" before they are penalized.\n\n\u201cFor many decades, federal agencies have been issuing thousands of pages of so-called guidance documents \u2014 a pernicious kind of regulation imposed by unaccountable bureaucrats in the form of commentary on how rules should be interpreted,\u201d Trump said at the executive order signing ceremony. \u201cAll too often guidance documents are a back door for regulators to effectively change the laws and vastly expand their scope and reach.\u201d\n\nWheeler wrote in Monday's memo that both executive orders (EOs) \u201ccontain important implications to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency processes that we will need to think critically about to implement.\"\n\n\u201cTo that end, the EPA will be quickly standing up two working groups to address interpreting and applying the EOs, one chaired by the Office of Policy and the other co-chaired by the Office of General Counsel and the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.\u201d\n\nWheeler said that until the working groups provide new instruction in the coming weeks the agency would continue \u201cnormal operations on all issues affected by the EOs.\u201d\n\nIssues that the EPA will consider include proposals to allow industries the \u201copportunity to be heard\u201d before fines, proposed procedures for \u201ccooperative information sharing\u201d and allowing for \u201ccertain exemptions for criminal actions and civil judicial actions,\u201d as allowed under the executive order, Wheeler said.", "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving forward with plans to implement two recent executive orders that aim to limit the impact of agency enforcement guidance on affected industries.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/epa-logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
