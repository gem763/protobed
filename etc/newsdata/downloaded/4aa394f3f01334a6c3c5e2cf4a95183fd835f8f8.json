Unfortunately, the pathologically unimaginative company is content to sell the future short.\n\nVirtual reality, augmented reality, and brain-computer interfaces are three of the most interesting areas in tech, and Facebook has placed its bets accordingly. While all three technologies could weave a near future in which we collectively feel less weighed down by the internet, the world\u2019s biggest social network has other plans.\n\nAt its big virtual reality developer event this week, Facebook announced \u201cFacebook Horizon,\u201d the \u201cculmination\u201d of the company\u2019s collective knowledge of \u201cvirtual spaces and communities.\u201d The virtual world, launching in 2020, outlines Facebook\u2019s vision for an even more immersive version of its social platform.\n\nFacebook promises a \u201ca bustling town square where people will meet and mingle\u201d\u2014optimistic language that hearkens back to a simpler time when Facebook\u2019s mission to \u201cconnect the world\u201d sounded benign enough, if hilariously self-important.\n\nIn a promo video, the company teased a cloying and nightmarishly mundane version of the near future. In its new virtual reality world, partially disembodied avatars float around a benign, colorful landscape, occasionally piloting propeller planes through sweeping virtual canyon vistas or painting pictures. Facebook\u2019s virtual world bears little resemblance to the often unsavory realities of social media. (Needless to say, Facebook\u2019s promo video didn\u2019t show any shadowy, deep-pocketed figures feeding dollar bills into unsupervised ad-vending kiosks or any avatars in yellow and black Fred Perry polos kicking the shit out of each other.)\n\nThis week, Facebook also announced that it would acquire CTRL-Labs, an innovative company cooking up a motor neuron-powered brain-computer interface that allows users to interact with a computer using only neural signals. The company\u2019s main device is an armband that monitors electrical signals transmitted from the brain to muscles, converting those signals to inputs.\n\nNot everyone was happy about the acquisition. And that\u2019s not even counting Congress.\n\nOf the acquisition, Facebook's VP of AR and VR didn\u2019t wax particularly poetic, explaining how the tech works and saying only that the company wants to build \u201cmore natural, intuitive ways to interact with devices and technology,\u201d i.e. its own platform.\n\n\"Our vision is that AR/VR will be the next major computing platform after mobile in about 10 years,\u201d Zuckerberg said in an internal letter about its aspirations. \u201cIt can be even more ubiquitous than mobile\u2014especially once we reach AR\u2014since you can always have it on.\u201d\n\nAs usual, Facebook\u2019s vision is jarringly cynical. The company\u2019s deep cynicism tends to get lost\u2014Facebook has long told a story of itself as a wide-eyed ing\u00e9nue, a company so optimistic it could not have anticipated the horrors it unleashed as it cashed in on its mission to \u201cconnect the world.\u201d A lot of people bought it.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is: This stuff is cool. Virtual worlds, for all their potential ills, are still exciting. Brain-computer interfaces are genuinely thrilling and futuristic. But in Facebook\u2019s grip, the color drains out. Just ask any of the founders of WhatsApp, Instagram, or Oculus\u2014they all headed for the exits in recent years.\n\nBUYING THE FUTURE\n\nThere might be more modest goals in tech, but Facebook has always wanted to own the future. The company is relentless in its quest to completely dominate whatever digital medium people pay attention to. The company\u2019s latest acquisition and its virtual reality plans signal one thing: Facebook failed to predict what was around the corner once and it learned a lesson. The company still resents Google and Apple for dominating the smartphone game and wants a bigger piece of the pie next time.\n\nFirst, it was desktop, and the company succeeded in making \u201cchecking Facebook\u201d shorthand for procrastinating on your work computer. But the company was slow to ship mobile apps that weren\u2019t buggy and awful. \u201cWe weren\u2019t happy with the quality of our mobile experiences, rewinding 18 months, so we just had a lot of foundational work to do,\u201d Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said in 2013, recalling that time. \u201cComing into this year, we could kind of tell we were turning the corner on that.\u201d\n\nBy 2013, the company successfully bet its future on mobile\u2014specifically mobile ad revenue, which it started to rake in by the pile. In 2011, Facebook made 0 dollars from mobile ads. Just two years later, it owned 16 percent of the mobile ad market. By 2017, its share of the mobile ad market was a whopping $14.4 billion.\n\nThe company wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake again.\n\nFACEBOOK\u2019S HORIZON\n\nEven as regulators threaten to unwind the company\u2019s biggest acquisitions, Facebook is smug enough to barrel forward, spending between $500 million and $1 billion for CTRL-Labs, its latest toy. For founders, the kind of money Facebook can shower on a fledgling innovation is understandably impossible to resist.\n\nUnfortunately, the influx of resources the company pumps into its new acquisitions can only delay the inevitable. At Facebook, all products move toward their inexorable fate as the company\u2019s latest cash cow, fattened up for slaughter.\n\nWe know how it will go down: there\u2019s a formula that dictates how Facebook chews through products. First, make something people like to use. Sink your claws deeply into users by optimizing for engagement, keeping them clicking little red bubbles and sending up showers of hearts. Then the ads come marching in.\n\nLook at Instagram\u2014a formerly universally loved photo sharing app now clotted so thoroughly with ads that it\u2019s barely usable. For the first few years following its acquisition, Instagram remained mostly intact. Friends shared pictures. You looked at them. You went back when there were new ones.\n\nNow, opening Instagram is like bouncing around in yet another social media slot machine, with endless visual signals to keep you idly clicking around and an algorithmic timeline that stirs posts you care about into a slop of advertising that\u2019s increasingly annoying but always just barely tolerable.\n\nIn a 2014 earnings call, Zuckerberg spoke wistfully of his platform in its earliest days. \u201cWe gave all of those things away for free,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly after we had a good, organic kind of interaction\u2026 did we really layer ads on top of that.\u201d\n\nIn that same call, Zuckerberg noted how he prefers to let new products simmer for a year or two before bringing them up to a boil and stirring the ads in. Facebook game plan: allowing products to reach a billion users before \u201cvery aggressively\u201d monetizing them.\n\n\u201cWe think these new ecosystems are going to ramp up over time\u2026 Rather than have this be an impact that you\u2019ll notice in a short term period of time,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nBoiling the frog is killer business. And unfortunately, the most interesting business Facebook can imagine is advertising in three dimensions instead of two.", "description": "In its obsessive quest to own the next era of computing, Facebook has no problem putting innovation in a chokehold.", "authors": ["Taylor Hatmaker", "Senior Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569636165/190927-Hatmaker-Facebook-tease_qtqq10", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
