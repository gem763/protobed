What does Sir Oliver want?\n\nSir Oliver said the one issue that concerns him is keeping the Benn Act extension in place as an insurance policy until the implementing legislation is passed by both Houses of Parliament and the UK's withdrawal is ratified.\n\nHe said the purpose of his amendment is to \"remove from the Government's motion the bits that would have had the legal effect of satisfying the Benn Act conditions and would therefore have removed the need for the PM to seek an extension\".\n\nBy way of explaining what has confused many, he added: \"In short, my aim is to ensure that Boris's deal succeeds, but that we have an insurance policy which prevents the UK from crashing out on 31 October by mistake if something goes wrong during the passage of the implementing legislation.\"\n\nSir Oliver Letwin, pictured in the House of Commons on Thursday, has tabled an amendment which would bolster anti-No Deal protections\n\nWhat will the government do if the Letwin amendment is passed by MPs?\n\nMr Johnson will have two options. He could choose to play ball with the amendment and bring forward all the laws needed to make Brexit happen.\n\nBut this would be risky because the PM would not know if there was a majority of MPs in favour of his deal which means it could all fall apart further down the line.\n\nIt would also force him to ask the EU to delay Brexit - something he does not want to do.\n\nThe second option would be for the premier to disregard the amendment, accuse MPs of hijacking the Brexit process and then demand a general election.\n\nWill there be a second referendum amendment?\n\nCurrently it is unclear whether pro-EU MPs will pull the trigger on trying to force a second referendum amid concerns they may not have the numbers to win.\n\nIt is thought that such an amendment would grant approval to the PM's deal but only if it was then put back to the people.\n\nIf the amendment is tabled and selected it will have the potential to dramatically alter the Brexit process.\n\nWhat happens if MPs vote in favour of a second referendum?\n\nIf a second referendum amendment is agreed by the Commons tomorrow it would trigger a volatile chain of events that are hard to predict.\n\nThe first question for the PM in the event such an amendment is agreed is whether he would proceed to push a vote on his deal.\n\nVotes on amendments always take place before the vote on the substantive motion which means the PM will have the ability to pull the division on his deal if he has just been defeated on holding a second referendum.\n\nSir Oliver's amendment has the support of Hilary Benn, pictured in London on October 8, as well as a large number of cross-party MPs\n\nThe PM is adamant that he does not want a second referendum and if he was to pull the vote on his deal and then refuse to present it to the Commons for a second time he would likely pivot to try to force a general election.\n\nThe Benn Act states that the PM must ask the EU for a Brexit delay if no agreement has been backed by MPs by close of play tomorrow.\n\nAssuming he then complied with the Act and the EU granted a delay the PM would then seemingly have cleared a path to an election because opposition leaders have said they would agree a snap poll if a No Deal split has been ruled out.\n\nWhat happens if MPs vote in favour of a second referendum and the PM pushes ahead with a vote on his deal?\n\nGiven the PM's opposition to a second referendum it is unlikely he would proceed with a vote on the deal itself if MPs pass an amendment in favour of a 'People's Vote'.\n\nBut if he did it is likely the deal would be agreed by MPs - the referendum provision would allow many critics to vote for the deal in the belief that it would be rejected by the country when pitched against Remain at a national ballot.\n\nIf Mr Johnson was willing to go along with the second referendum plan - again, this is extremely unlikely - he would then have to ask the EU for a delay to make time for the vote to be held, potentially in the first half of next year.\n\nIf Mr Johnson allowed the vote to go ahead and the deal plus a referendum was agreed to but he then refused to put in place the necessary measures to hold that ballot it would be up to rebel MPs to take control of the Commons to push through the necessary legislation to make a 'People's Vote' happen.\n\nIf they failed there would then almost certainly be a general election because it would literally be the only option left.\n\nWhat happens if MPs vote in favour of a second referendum but then reject the PM's deal?\n\nThis feels incredibly unlikely because if an amendment is put forward to hold a public vote on the PM's deal and it was passed by MPs there is no reason to think that majority would disappear on the subsequent vote on the amended deal.\n\nBut if for some weird reason it happened it would trigger the same outcomes as if there is no second referendum amendment and MPs simply reject the PM's deal.\n\nWill MPs vote for the Prime Minister's deal?\n\nThe vote could come down to the tightest of margins but it is understood the Prime Minister spent Friday working hard to win over MPs.\n\nDUP MP Sammy Wilson has said his party would continue to hold firm and will vote against the deal on offer, while Nicola Sturgeon has ruled out her MPs in the SNP backing the deal.\n\nJeremy Corbyn was quick to dismiss the agreement, and said Labour could not support the deal. But, this is where things get interesting.\n\nAttention has turned to the Labour Party's own psychodrama, with focus on what MPs in Leave-voting seats will opt to do.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph reported that between 10 and 15 Labour MPs are prepared to back the deal to avoid a no-deal scenario.\n\nIs it as simple as one yes or no vote?\n\nNo. MPs amended the Saturday sitting motion by approving a proposal tabled by former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin, now sitting as an Independent.\n\nSir Oliver explained this would allow MPs to move amendments to the Government's proposal and for them to be voted upon if selected by the Speaker, as mentioned above.\n\nThe SNP has tabled an amendment to reject the deal demanding an immediate extension to the October 31 deadline and a general election.\n\nLabour MP Peter Kyle claimed more than 90 of his colleagues had thrown their weight behind an amendment which calls for a confirmatory referendum on the future relationship with the EU should Mr Johnson's deal fail.\n\nAnd Sir Oliver has put forward an amendment that, if accepted and approved, would withhold approval of the deal unless and until implementing legislation has passed.\n\nJohn Bercow, the Commons Speaker pictured at an event in London on Wednesday, will play a key role on 'Super Saturday' because he will be in charge of selecting which amendments are voted on\n\nWhat happens if MPs reject the PM's Brexit deal?\n\nIn the event that MPs vote down the PM's new accord there are a variety of different ways forward which Mr Johnson could choose from.\n\nOption one: If the deal was narrowly defeated and Mr Johnson believed there was a path to victory he could ask the EU for a delay - he will be legally required to do so under the Benn Act - and then either hold a second vote next week or ask Brussels to tweak the deal before a second vote.\n\nShould the EU agree to make changes the PM could ask MPs to vote again and if it then passed the UK would be on course to leave the EU with an agreement but probably after the October 31 deadline.\n\nIf the EU refused to budge or if MPs stuck to their guns then the UK would be on course to quit the bloc without an agreement.\n\nOption two: The PM could refuse to ask for a Brexit delay and opt to resign instead. A government official would then likely ask the EU for an extension in order to comply with the Benn Act.\n\nAssuming the EU granted an extension a general election would then follow.\n\nOption three: The PM could ask the EU to delay the UK's departure from the bloc in order to trigger an election in a final attempt to break the Brexit stalemate.\n\nBrussels has suggested it would grant an extension for an election and if everything went to plan there would then be a snap poll held before the end of 2019.\n\nOption four: The PM could ask for the EU to grant a delay and the bloc could refuse on the grounds that is has had enough of the ongoing Brexit uncertainty.\n\nThat would prompt the PM to either put his deal to a second vote in the Commons or to pivot to a No Deal divorce.\n\nIf the PM won the second vote on his deal an orderly divorce would beckon. If he lost the UK would be on course to leave the EU without an agreement.\n\nWhat happens if MPs vote in favour of the PM's deal?\n\nThis would be the most straight forward option from a 'what happens next' perspective.\n\nThe final vote on the deal is expected to be very tight and nobody knows for certain which way it will go.\n\nBut if the deal were to be agreed by the Commons the government could then bring forward the laws needed to enact the UK's departure from the EU.\n\nThe accord would then be put to the European Parliament to be ratified. Assuming MEPs did not block the deal the UK would then leave the EU with an accord on October 31.\n\nHow rare is a Saturday sitting?\n\nThe Commons has only sat on four Saturdays since 1939, including on September 2 that year, due to the outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nThe last time there was a Saturday sitting was April 3 1982 following the invasion of the Falkland Islands.\n\nMPs also sat on Saturday July 30 1949 in order to finish up business before the summer adjournment as well as on Saturday November 3 1956 due to the Suez crisis.", "description": "Boris Johnson is locked in a frantic race against time as he tries to persuade a majority of MPs to back his Brexit deal at a crunch vote in the Commons tomorrow.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/15/19881586-0-image-a-7_1571410756506.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
