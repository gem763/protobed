But it means Johnson he has to ask the EU to delay Britain\u2019s departure, since Parliament previously passed a law compelling him to do that if a Brexit divorce deal had not been passed by Saturday.\n\nThe government still hopes it can pass the needed legislation by the end of the month so the U.K. can leave on time.\n\nA defiant Johnson said after the vote that he was not \u201cdaunted or dismayed\u201d by the result and would push ahead with plans to leave the EU.\n\nAs lawmakers debated, tens of thousands of anti-Brexit demonstrators descended on London to march to Parliament Square, demanding a new referendum on whether Britain should leave the EU or remain. Protesters, many wearing blue berets emblazoned with yellow stars symbolizing the EU flag, poured out of subway trains and buses for the last-ditch protest effort.\n\nBruce Nicole, a vicar from Camberley southwest of London, said the Brexit deal would harm Britain.\n\n\u201cI fervently believe that we should remain in the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cI am British but I am also European.\u201d\n\nIn Parliament before the vote, Johnson implored legislators to ratify the deal he struck this week with the bloc\u2019s 27 other leaders. He said members of the House of Commons should \u201ccome together as democrats to end this debilitating feud\u201d over Brexit, which has bitterly divided the country since British voters narrowly chose in a 2016 vote to leave the EU.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for this great House of Commons to come together\u2026 as I believe people at home are hoping and expecting,\u201d Johnson told lawmakers.\n\nBut he did not get the result he sought.\n\nTrouble began when House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said he would first allow a vote on an amendment that puts the vote on the deal off until another day.\n\nThe amendment makes support for the deal conditional on the legislation to implement it being passed by Parliament, something that could take several days or weeks. It also gives lawmakers another chance to scrutinize - and possibly change- the Brexit departure terms while the legislation is passing through Parliament.\n\nJohnson called any delay to Britain\u2019s Brexit departure date \u201cpointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust.\u201d\n\nAnd he warned Saturday that the bloc\u2019s approval could not be guaranteed.\n\n\u201cThere is very little appetite among our friends in the EU for this business to be protracted by one extra day,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey have had three and a half years of this debate.\u201d\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron made the same point a day earlier in Brussels.\n\n\u201cI want us to finish this off and speak about the future,\u201d Macron said. \u201cThe Oct. 31 date must be respected. I don\u2019t believe new delays should be granted.\u201d\n\nThe EU\u2019s budget commissioner, Guenther Oettinger, told Germany\u2019s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that if British lawmakers reject Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, the U.K. is likely to crash out of the bloc with no deal.\n\nBritain could still leave the EU on Oct. 31, if Parliament approves the legislation - the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - in time. The government plans to introduce the bill early next week and could hold late-night sittings of Parliament in hope of getting it passed within days.\n\nAs lawmakers thundered on in their first Saturday sitting since the 1982 Falklands War, the streets of London turned into a sea of blue. Some demonstrators with bells strapped to their legs and wielding sticks performed a traditional morris dance and chanted: \u201cMorris, not Boris!\u201d to cheers from onlookers.\n\nOthers were deeply fearful about leaving the EU.\n\nSarah Spoor from west London said she had two children with disabilities and feared for their health because of possible shortages of medicines and the fact that EU doctors and nurses could leave the U.K. after Brexit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m distraught. Distraught. It\u2019s really distressing,\u201d she said, tears welling up.\n\nJohnson hopes for success in getting a fractious Parliament to back the deal after his predecessor, Theresa May, failed three times to get lawmakers behind her Brexit plan.\n\nYet his hopes of getting the deal through Parliament were dealt a blow when his Northern Ireland ally, the Democratic Unionist Party, said it would not back him. The party says Johnson\u2019s Brexit package - which carves out special status for Northern Ireland to keep an open border with EU member Ireland - is bad for the region and weakens its bonds with the rest of the U.K.\n\nTo make up for the votes of 10 DUP lawmakers, Johnson has tried to persuade members of the left-of-center Labour Party to support the deal. Late Friday the government promised to bolster protections for the environment and workers\u2019 rights to allay Labour fears that the Conservative government plans to slash those protections after Brexit.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed those promises as inadequate.\n\n\u201cThis deal is not good for jobs, damaging for industry and a threat to our environment and natural world,\u201d he said. \u201cSupporting the government this afternoon would merely fire the starting pistol in a race to the bottom in regulations and standards.\u201d\n\n___\n\nGregory Katz contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In a major blow to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, U.K. lawmakers voted Saturday to postpone a decision on whether to back his Brexit deal with the European Union, throwing a wrench into government plans to leave the bloc at the end of this month.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jill Lawless", "Mike Corder"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/aptopix_britain_brexit_18333_c0-232-5568-3480_s1200x700.jpg?d042ba9cdffe740cc9608ebfe48d30fe03930ac4", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
