That said, de Santana says that his team \u201cused many lines of evidence to prove that there\u2019s more than one electric eel species.\u201d This trinity differs not only in physique, but also in genetics, habitat, and electric power. Tellingly, the eels\u2019 DNA suggests that they last shared a common ancestor 7 million years ago, which means that they started to diverge well before brown bears and polar bears, lions and tigers, and even humans and chimpanzees.\n\nOne of the trio retains the original name Electrophorus electricus, and de Santana now calls it Linnaeus\u2019s electric eel, after the legendary Swedish taxonomist who classified it. The two others are now Volta\u2019s electric eel (Electrophorus voltai), after the Italian physicist who built a battery based on the animal, and Vari\u2019s electric eel (Electrophorus varii), after Richard Peter Vari, a famous ichthyologist who was part of de Santana\u2019s team until his death in 2016. (Most of the eels used in previous research are likely to be Vari\u2019s eels, since they\u2019re the only species from Peru, the only country from which these animals can be legally exported.)\n\n\u201cThese findings do not surprise me,\u201d says Graciela Unguez from New Mexico State University. As researchers sample electric fishes from more parts of South America, she adds, they\u2019re almost bound to find that currently known species harbor more diversity than people suspected.\n\nThe same goes for unusual animals whose outward distinctiveness can mask subtler differences that become clear only through genetic analyses. Such studies have shown that there are likely four distinct species of giraffe, three species of mola mola, and two species of African elephants. \u201cWe sort of lump the weirdos together,\u201d says Prosanta Chakrabarty from Louisiana State University. \u201cOh, obviously, this thing is that thing, and no one looks more carefully. We all thought that an electric eel is an electric eel.\u201d\n\nContrary to appearances, they\u2019re not even eels. They\u2019re knife fishes\u2014a group of mostly small, gill-breathing species that have flattened bodies and that produce weak electric fields for navigation and communication. The misnamed eels buck all these trends\u2014weirdos, even within their own family. They breathe by rising to the surface and gulping air, which makes them one of the only fish that you can drown. Their thick, cylindrical, meaty bodies can reach seven feet in length. And the electric organs that make up 80 percent of that length can produce shocks that are strong enough to incapacitate a human or a horse.\n\nRead: The stunning case of leaping electric eels\n\nCollecting these animals from the wild, as de Santana did, is not easy. \u201cI do it by myself, or with the help of really experienced fishermen,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t allow students to do it. It\u2019s never safe.\u201d Even if he wears rubber gloves, the sweat that builds up inside them eventually links up with the water outside them, creating a continuous conductive layer. Bottom line: You can\u2019t collect electric eels without suffering shocks, which de Santana compares to getting hit with a Taser. It\u2019s even worse in the dry season, when more than 10 individuals can occupy a single stream. \u201cWhen one starts to discharge, the others do too,\u201d says de Santana. \u201cYou just get used to it. You do what you have to do.\u201d", "description": "I\u2019m shocked, shocked, I tell you.", "authors": ["Ed Yong"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/2A_Carlos_David_de_Santana_Electrophorus_voltai_Xingu_River_4_Picture_by_L._Sousa/facebook.jpg?1568057870", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
