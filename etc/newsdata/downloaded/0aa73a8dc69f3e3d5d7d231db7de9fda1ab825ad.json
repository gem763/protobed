The offense took a big blow early in the second when Graham threw a deep interception to Don Chapman at the Tar Heel 32. North Carolina scored its first touchdown on the ensuing drive.\n\nNorth Carolina led 17-0 at halftime on Noah Ruggles\u2019 32-yard field goal, Dazz Newsome\u2019s 20-yard touchdown catch and Beau Corrales\u2019 6-yard TD reception. Outside linebacker Tomon Fox had a sack in the second and nose tackle Aaron Crawford had a sack in the third.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nNorth Carolina: The Tar Heels, who were coming off a one point loss to then-No. 1 Clemson, still have plenty to clean up. Newsome, Rontavius Green and Brown dropped long passes near the goal line in the first half, and there were more hiccups in the third. A penalty pushed the offense back, and Ruggles missed wide right on a 39-yarder. Brown dropped an easy pass on the next drive and the Tar Heels went three-and-out, but the blowout was sealed when Javonte Williams\u2019 3-yard run made it 38-15.\n\nGeorgia Tech: The Jackets had won nine of the last 10 home games in the 40-year series, but didn\u2019t give the announced crowd of 45,044 much to cheer about other than Graham\u2019s 28-yard TD pass to Malachi Carter and Jordan Mason\u2019s 2-yard TD run in the fourth that cut the lead to 24-15 on a two-point conversion. Georgia Tech has yet to score in the first quarter this season.\n\nHURTING\n\nThe Tar Heels starting strong safety Cam\u2019Ron Kelly had surgery for a torn ACL Thursday and will miss the rest of the season. Kelly was injured in the closing minutes against Clemson. It got worse for the secondary in the first quarter when starting cornerback Trey Morrison left with an upper body injury and was done for the day.\n\nFASHION STATEMENT\n\nGeorgia Tech wore a new color scheme for the first time, an onyx gray uniform to raise awareness for Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta. Four team captains were dressed in gold capes for the pregame coin toss, and during two early timeouts, Georgia Tech introduced children recovering from serious illnesses. The kids and their young siblings also wore gold capes.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNorth Carolina is off next week and visits Virginia Tech on Oct. 19.\n\nGeorgia Tech visits Duke next week and Miami on Oct. 19.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sam Howell threw four touchdown passes and North Carolina suffered no letdown from last week's narrow loss to the nation's No. 1 team, snapping a three-game losing streak with a 38-22 victory over Georgia Tech on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "George Henry"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
