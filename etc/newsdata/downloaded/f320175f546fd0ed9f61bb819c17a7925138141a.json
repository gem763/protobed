Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told The Associated Press that he and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., are also discussing penalizing other countries that sell weapons to Turkey.\n\nRead more: Turkey launches military operation against the Kurds in Syria just days after Trump abandoned them\n\nVan Hollen said the measure could also import sanctions on senior Turkish officials and that the penalties would be lifted when Turkey withdrew its forces.\n\nBoth lawmakers said they expect wide support from both parties. That underscores the broad bipartisan opposition in Congress to Trump's sudden move.\n\nGraham, a former longtime member of the Senate Armed Services and a leading congressional voice on military matters, said he had reached agreement with Van Hollen.\n\n\"While the administration refuses to act against Turkey, I expect strong bipartisan support,\" Graham said in a written statement. \"Most members of Congress believe it would be wrong to abandon the Kurds who have been strong allies\" in fighting the Islamic State group.\n\nGraham, normally a staunch Trump ally, has been a leading critic of the president's decision to pull back U.S. forces back.\n\nRead more: Lindsey Graham threatens 'sanctions from hell' and warns Turkey against crossing a 'red line' as it readies for attack in Syria\n\nTurkey launched air and ground assaults into northern Syria against the Kurds on Wednesday after the U.S. move. Syrian Kurdish fighters have been America's only allies in Syria fighting IS, and hundreds of American troops have been stationed there.\n\nTurkey considers the Kurdish fighters to be terrorists allied with a Kurdish insurgency in Turkey.\n\nTrump's removal of American forces increased the chances that Turkey would invade Syria, even though he has threatened to \"totally destroy and obliterate\" Turkey's economy if the Turkish push went too far.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Sen.
