These are the choices before you.\u2019 That is what we will put forward.\u201d\n\nMr Corbyn was also challenged over whether Labour MPs could back a deal secured by Mr Johnson ahead of the 31 October deadline for Brexit.\n\nHe replied: \u201cIt absolutely depends what the deal is. I\u2019ve no idea what deal he wants to bring back.\n\n\u201cBut all my instincts are that Boris Johnson actually wants a no-deal exit from the European Union, which is why has refused consistently to confirm that he will abide by what\u2019s called the EU (Number 6) Act, which requires him to apply for an extension in the event of a no-deal looming up at the end of October.\u201d\n\nWith around 30 Labour MPs said to be considering backing a Johnson deal in order to bring the Brexit uncertainty to an end, Mr Corbyn indicated he would not offer his MPs a free vote on the issue.\n\n\u201cI would hope we could vote together as a party on this,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking with an EU flag draped around her shoulders at Saturday's rally, Ms Thornberry said: \"Whatever terms are agreed by which we leave the European Union, by whatever government, no matter what it says, we must make sure that there's a second referendum, we must make sure that Remain is on the ballot paper, we must make sure that Labour campaigns for Remain - and not just that, but that we lead the campaign to Remain.\n\n\"We believe in internationalism. We believe in socialism. And if we believe in internationalism and socialism - why on earth would we back Brexit?...We all say no, no, no to Brexit.\"\n\nSir Keir also argued that Labour had \"got to listen\" to pro-EU party members and confirmed that he would campaign for Remain in any referendum.\n\nSpeaking at his first People's Vote rally, the influential shadow Brexit secretary said he was now \"utterly convinced\" that a referendum was the only solution to the Brexit crisis.\n\n\"When that time comes, I will campaign for Remain alongside millions of other people in this country, because it's not just a technical question of whether you want to be in or out of the EU, it's about what sort of country we want to be,\" Sir Keir told a crowd of an estimated 5,000 people.", "description": "Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has signalled he will resist pressure to commit his party to backing Remain in any future Brexit referendum.
