They whistled past the graveyard in 2018 right up to a colossal congressional and down-ballot ass-beating on Election Day, but the real future they face is almost unimaginably bad.\n\nDonald Trump is locked in his now-tiresome rage spiral as economic, foreign policy, and moral failures of his crapulous administration mount. The endless, wearing cycle of \u201cfail, lie, deny, ragetweet, lather, rinse, repeat\u201d is an ugly, constant whine in our lives.\n\nDemocrats are caught up in the 2020 race for the nomination, full of passions for candidates, ideas, and issues that won\u2019t matter in the general election next November. Trump is still in a position to win due to their usual campaign ineptitude and the lack of a superstar candidate with the talent of Barack Obama or Bill Clinton.", "description": "Think about the 2024 race, when Republicans are trying wash the Trump stink off of them.
