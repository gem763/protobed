Volker, who testified before the committees last week, said that the delegation later met with Trump to discuss their visit to the country.The three House panels are further demanding documentation of Perry's reported efforts to urge the Ukrainian president to replace members of the board of Naftogaz, Ukraine's state gas company. The Associated Press reported that one of the preferred candidates offered by Perry, a former Texas governor, was a former political donor.\n\nThe subpoena to Perry comes hours after the committee chairmen issued subpoenas to two of Giuliani's business associates who had been arrested on Wednesday at Dulles International Airport as they tried to leave the country. The two businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested on campaign finance charges.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe subpoenas to Parnas and Fruman demand documents and testimony regarding their roles in helping Giuliani pressure Ukrainian officials to open an investigation into the Bidens. The committees had previously asked the two businessmen for documents and to appear for depositions on Capitol Hill this week, but their lawyer said that they would not comply.\n\n\n\n\u201cYour clients are private citizens who are not employees of the Executive Branch. They may not evade requests from Congress for documents and information necessary to conduct our inquiry. They are required by law to comply with the enclosed subpoenas. They are not exempted from this requirement merely because they happen to work with Mr. Giuliani, and they may not defy congressional subpoenas merely because President Trump has chosen the path of denial, defiance, and obstruction,\u201d the chairmen wrote in a letter to John Dowd, the lawyer for Parnas and Fruman.\n\n\n\nAside from Perry and Giuliani's business associates, the three committees have issued subpoenas to the White House, Pentagon, State Department and Office of Management and Budget in recent days.", "description": "House Democrats on Thursday subpoenaed Energy Secretary Rick Perry for documentation of his involvement with President Trump's efforts to\u00a0push the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/perryrick_031418gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
