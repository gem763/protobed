Above what return on equity can we confidently deride the banks for profiteering?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is hard to answer. But the view of politicians, and it seems the central bank, is that the major banks can operate just fine at a reduced return on equity, given they remain among the most profitable lenders in the world.\n\nYes, the reduction in the cash rate to below 1 per cent will crimp their net interest margins. That's because the profits they make lending out free deposits fall just as falling bond yields further reduces interest income.\n\nBut policymakers seem to have the view that if ROEs shift from around 12 per cent to 10 per cent or lower, the system will handle it just fine. And if that reduction in profitability is distributed into the economy via lower lending rates, the economy in aggregate is better off, they would argue.\n\nShareholder trade-off\n\nThe sensitivity to falling bank profits is likely to be felt most by shareholders, such as retirees, who rely on the dividend income generated by those profits. As we are reminded by the banks, we are all shareholders via our superannuation funds.\n\nBut for society in aggregate this is a trade-off we have made before.\n\nIn 2014, David Murray concluded as part of the Financial System Inquiry that in order to reduce the risk and cost of an expensive taxpayer funded bail-out, our banks should be unquestionably strong by global standards. To do this would require raising more equity capital, reducing returns on equity.\n\nBut Murray believed that the dividends generated by the banks should be considered more valuable, because profits from stronger banks were more sustainable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe debate is similar now. Bank profits will come under threat from falling interest rates, and therefore so will dividends that their investors rely upon.\n\nBut this is an environment where bank depositors and investors in government bonds have had their incomes slashed to almost zero.\n\nAs a margin above deposit and bond rates, Australian bank dividend yields are actually extraordinarily high.\n\nThe earnings yield of the banks is up from 2.5 per cent above the bond rate to almost 8 per cent. While the dividend yield was 1 per cent above term deposit rates in 2010, and got up to 2.5 per cent in 2016, today it's over 3.5 per cent.\n\nFor this reason, the net effect of lower interest rates is to lower bank profits but to make the income they generate more valuable. In a relative sense there are reasons why the banks remain an investment that should hold its value.\n\nThe real losers\n\nOf course, one cannot eat relative returns. And for both savers and investors the absolute reduction in income poses a challenge.\n\nThe real wealth transfer, as it always has been when the central bank eases policy, is from prudent savers to profligate borrowers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInevitably, savers will either have to eat into their capital or risk more of it to finance the same amount of consumption.\n\nWhat also appears inevitable is another interest rate cut. Morgan Stanley analysts have previously predicted the banks may not be able to pass on much of another reduction if they are to maintain their profits.\n\nThat will no doubt spark another round of outrage in which everyone will fight their corner.\n\nThe Coalition wants a strong economy without having to threaten a surplus and wants monetary policy to work as hard as possible. A bit of bank bashing never hurt a politician, either.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has a job to restore inflation to its target, doesn't want a credit downturn on its watch and wants the banks to cooperate as much as possible to increase the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nAnd the banks naturally want to be as profitable as the environment allows them to be.\n\nWhether that's too profitable or not profitable enough will always depend on who you ask.", "description": "An interest rate cut has sparked predictable outrage as to whether the banks' actions are justified.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_4.5152%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_226/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2df2142c1077463ef9cb00eb78b23c73299e2b76", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
