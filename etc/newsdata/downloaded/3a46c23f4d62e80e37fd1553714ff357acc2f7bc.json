Although, at this stage of Harris\u2019s decline, Gabbard going after her a second time would basically amount to desecration of a corpse.\n\nBut Gabbard owes her for that snide, hubristic line after the second debate when Harris scoffed that she was a \u201ctop-tier candidate\u201d whereas Gabbard was a one-percenter. Months later, Gabbard is still a one-percenter \u2014 but Harris is down below five percent in the RCP average. How does Tulsi suppress the urge to gloat at her collapse, which just so happened to begin after Gabbard\u2019s own attack on Harris\u2019s record as California AG at that same second debate?\n\nNo, seriously, though, if anyone\u2019s getting nuked at this next debate, it may be Gabbard herself. Possibly via a first strike by Harris.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s laid down some of the toughest attacks of all of the debates, first against [Rep. Tim] Ryan, later against Harris,\u201d said Democratic strategist Mark Longabaugh, an adviser for Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign, which Gabbard supported. \u201cIf I\u2019m on the stage with her in this upcoming debate, I\u2019d certainly want to be prepared to rebut or to deal with Tulsi Gabbard coming at me.\u201d\u2026 \u201cAs she proved with Kamala, she\u2019s more than willing to say the thing other people are definitely not willing to say,\u201d said Democratic strategist Julia Barnes, the national field director for Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign. \u201cYou just have to balance that with the fact that the other half of the sh\u2013 she says is so completely off message for the party and the values that she espouses to represent,\u201d Barnes continued, noting that Gabbard was one of the last House Democrats to support an impeachment inquiry against Trump. \u201cComing out against impeachment? Come on. Is she really going to stand up onstage and say that? I can only imagine that that is an invitation for 100 percent of the participants just to cut her off at the knees.\u201d\u2026 \u201cI would watch for Tulsi to be one of the wild cards that blows up the debate,\u201d a veteran Democratic presidential campaign strategist said. \u201cIf I were preparing for this debate with one of the other candidates, especially if I was Elizabeth Warren, I would be very wary of Tulsi Gabbard now being back on the stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe could even decide to put the whole Democratic presidential field on blast for politicizing the impeachment process,\u201d Politico wonders, which would be a terrible idea for a left-wing candidate who was already waaaaay late in joining the rest of her party in calling for an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s Ukraine conduct. She reluctantly supports that inquiry now after complaining for weeks about how \u201cdivisive\u201d impeachment would be, but that probably won\u2019t quell lefty suspicions about her. They view her as too Trump-friendly, having once interviewed with the president about a job during the transition period after the last election and turning up sporadically on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox show to commiserate about interventionism. For Gabbard to use her time onstage to scold Democrats about impeachment instead of Trump \u2014 even if it\u2019s on \u201cstyle\u201d grounds related to politicization \u2014 would be freakishly tone-deaf in a Democratic primary at a moment when the party\u2019s trying to convince voters that the president should be ousted.\n\nWhich is why I think Harris might go after her over it. It\u2019s not just about repaying Gabbard for the attack at the second debate, although it\u2019s partly about that. And it\u2019s not just about demonstrating that Harris is a good debater after Gabbard got the best of her in that earlier exchange, although it\u2019s partly about that too. It\u2019s mainly about Harris trying to rebuild some buzz by hammering Trump on the trail every day, up to and including her weird crusade lately to get him banned from Twitter. If Harris wants to rebrand as the candidate who\u2019ll take it to Trump the most aggressively in the general election, believing that that pitch will appeal to lefties in a visceral way, blasting Gabbard for being some sort of Trump shill is a succinct way to do it. I bet she will.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s an obvious answer to the question of who Gabbard should attack if she\u2019s looking to use what\u2019s left of her campaign to advance her future in the party. That would be Joe Biden, a candidate whom she\u2019s defended in the past from attacks by the likes of Harris. That\u2019s never made sense: Gabbard is a leftist in the Bernie mold, not a centrist like Biden. And Gabbard, the hardcore isolationist, has plenty of policy ammo to use against Biden, starting with his early support for the Iraq war. Damaging Grandpa Joe at the debate would earn back some respect for her from the left who dislike her chumminess with Carlson, and it might make Elizabeth Warren view her as a valuable surrogate potentially, which could earn Gabbard a favor down the road from the likely nominee. There\u2019s every reason for Gabbard to take Warren\u2019s side against Biden at this point. Instead, it\u2019s *Warren* whom she\u2019s been critical of lately on foreign policy, notes Politico, with Gabbard recently saying of her, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen much come from her in the way of what kind of leadership and decision making that she would bring to that most important responsibility that the president has.\u201d\n\nThat must be her honest opinion and she must be resolved to stating her honest opinion at all moments because there\u2019s no strategic value to her saying that about the person who\u2019s most likely to face Trump next fall.\n\nVia RCP, here\u2019s Harris recently reiterating her odd interest in Trump\u2019s Twitter account. She has the better of the argument against Tapper here, that Twitter is within its rights to enforce its terms of service and that banning someone for condoning lawbreaking isn\u2019t that slippery a slope, but it\u2019s impossible to see how this pitch is the thing that\u2019ll get her back in the race. Right, it proves that she\u2019s willing to fight Trump on even the smallest battlefield, but all of the Democratic candidates hate Trump. (Except Gabbard, I guess.) Being the person who hates him just a teeny tiny bit more isn\u2019t going to make her the nominee when Warren\u2019s out there rolling out plans for a redistribution revolution.", "description": "Nothing to lose.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/t-7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
