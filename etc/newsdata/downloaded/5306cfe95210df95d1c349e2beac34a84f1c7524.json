That occurred clearly recently when the crossed below the , which it has done further more recently.\n\nBut that indicator can lead by nine months to 22 months. And Treasury bond yields have been so manipulated in the last decade of QE that who knows how meaningful that is anyway.\n\nBut this indicator is more of a warning of falling growth, as the real trend is that long-term bond yields are plummeting as the bond market sees slowing U.S. and global growth. That has been a big part of the recent correction in stocks.\n\nBut there are other, more fundamental leading indicators that are more meaningful.\n\nRetail- And Financial-Stock Performance\n\nDow Jones Home Construction Index\n\nMy first non-mainstream indicator was the index that peaked in late 2005 \u2013 26 months before the stock peak in October 2007. That peaked in early January 2018 suggesting on a similar lag a stock top around March of 2020.That index has had a stronger counter rally into July than it did into early 2007 before declining again. That has been due to the unusual trend of interest rates going down into a late-stage boom due to Fed easing. It would be more confirming if that index started turning down again soon, as it looks likely to do as home sales continue to weaken. I showed recently that RV sales peaked in 2017 and have accelerated down 20% year-over-year into 2019. That also led the October 2007 top and January 2008 recession by almost two years and suggests very early 2020. But there are two stock sectors that also led the last top and they are telling the same story: the retail (NYSE: ) and financial (NYSE: ) sectors.The financial and retail sectors started underperforming the before the 2007 top as well, and they are doing it again. Financials peaked in February 2018 and have been largely underperforming ever since. The retail sector peaked in July 2018 and has underperformed even more so. Amazon (NASDAQ: ) has underperformed the S&P 500 since June 2018. It appears to be turning down again.\n\nConsumer Discretionary Signals\n\nThe consumer discretionary sector has also been underperforming the consumer staple sector since June 2018, meaning consumers are increasingly buying what they need, not what they want. How long can you keep lowering rates until all consumers have refinanced, or bought a new car or house if they were going to?\n\nAnd has continued to rise since 2014 while growth peaked and has been steadily declining. Those two have rarely diverged that long. Yet, from the Michigan Survey suddenly plummeted to just below 90 in August after hitting 100 in late May and still at 98 in July. So that may already be crashing fast.\n\nElsewhere, there are other reports of high-end consumer spending falling, including real estate in the hottest areas from London to Manhattan to San Francisco. I have seen discounts on luxury cars similar to the one I got on a Maserati in early 2009: 20-25%! The entire dealer margin isn\u2019t even that much.\n\nThe trends are clear from all angles. Despite never-ending stimulus and now one-time tax cuts at the beginning of 2018, we keep returning to that dreaded 2% real growth. At some point the fundamentals will win and kicking the can down the road will lose. That looks like it will occur early next year.\n\nWhat Will Donald Do?\n\nThe wild card is obviously how much can Desperate Donald get away with at the last minute, desperate stimulus programs like a payroll tax holiday for the everyday citizen to get direct cash benefits? Or maybe he just talks the Congress into sending everyone a $5,000 check printed by the Fed from thin air, if they spend it before the election\u2026 but, that would be really cheesy!\n\nDoesn\u2019t look any more whacky and desperate than what we\u2019ve already seen from central banks. Imagine how history looks at these accomplished grown men and women feeding the economy \u201ccrack\u201d and thinking it could all work out okay.\n\nAt best, stocks peak by early next year; at worst, just after the election \u2013 if the president can pull off one more major magic trick. But the wheels may already be too much in motion for even that.\n\nIf he does manage to get re-elected, he will really wish he hadn\u2019t as he could have blamed it on the Fed when he got defeated and not be on the hot spot for the crash of a lifetime.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Harry Dent covering: S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Amazon.com Inc, Dow Jones Home Construction.
