I can say maybe we did not make the correct options.\n\n\"We worked very hard to support him.\"\n\nHe added: \"I am sorry because we disappointed a lot of fans in Greece and fans who supported us here.\"", "description": "Greece are calling for the officials who oversaw their final game at the Basketball World Cup to be banned after NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and his team exited the tournament amid rancour on Monday.
