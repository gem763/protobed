Civilian aircraft must stay clear of the area, according to freshly published NOTAMs (notices to airmen).\n\nThe air and artillery strikes have been reportedly targeting the vicinity of the Syrian border towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn.\n\nSyrian state media has released footage from Ras al-Ayn showing multiple warplanes in the skies as well as a thick plume of black smoke from a fire caused by the air strikes.\n\nThe military operation appears to be primarily targeting the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group largely consisting of ethnic Kurds. The SDF has been a close ally of the US-led coalition, with members serving as foot soldiers for its years-long fight against IS.\n\nTurkish warplanes have started to carry out airstrikes on civilian areas. There is a huge panic among people of the region. \u2014 Mustafa Bali (@mustefabali) October 9, 2019\n\nThe SDF said the Syrian towns of Qamishli and Ain Issa were also targeted by Turkish warplanes. The airstrikes have inflicted civilian casualties, the group added, citing preliminary reports from the ground.\n\nAlso on rt.com WATCH: Former US military base in N.
