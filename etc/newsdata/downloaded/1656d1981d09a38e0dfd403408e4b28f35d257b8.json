Sign up here.\n\nRose McGowan is suing Harvey Weinstein with allegations that the disgraced movie mogul recruited a network of attorneys, media power players, and even spies to keep her from going public with allegations that Weinstein raped her.\n\nMcGowan was one of the earliest and most vocal women to speak out against Weinstein, who has now been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 80 women. In 1997, McGowan reportedly received $100,000 to settle with Weinstein, who she said raped her at the Sundance Film Festival that year.\n\nBut in a lawsuit filed Wednesday, McGowan alleges that Weinstein roped in prominent lawyers David Boies and Lisa Bloom as well as hired the \u201cinternational spy agency Black Cube,\u201d as the lawsuit describes it, into his efforts to discredit her.\n\nBoies, Bloom, their law firms, and Black Cube are all named as defendants in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in California and includes claims of racketeering, fraud, and invasion of privacy. McGowan previously asked for $6 million to settle the matter, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\u201cThis case is about a diabolical and illegal effort by one of America\u2019s most powerful men and his representatives to silence sexual-assault victims,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201cAnd it is about the courageous women and journalists who persisted to reveal the truth.\u201d\n\nWeinstein first started targeting McGowan in 2016, after she tweeted she had been raped by somebody who distributed her movie, according to the lawsuit. Soon afterward, Boies, Weinstein\u2019s longtime associate, allegedly hired Black Cube to squash any Weinstein-related negative publicity, on Weinstein\u2019s behalf.\n\nA Black Cube operative going by the name of Diana Filip eventually befriended McGowan, through posing as an advocate for women, and secretly recorded their conversations, according to the lawsuit. McGowan says she also let Filip read some of her memoir.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Black Cube has been linked to Weinstein. In November 2017, the New Yorker reported that Weinstein used their operatives to look into women who might accuse him of sexual misconduct, as well as the journalists reporting out those allegations.\n\nMcGowan alleges that Roy Price, then the head of Amazon Studios, also contributed to Weinstein\u2019s purported plan to silence her, by purchasing a screenplay McGowan had written simply to kill it. Price is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Bloom, the daughter of women\u2019s rights lawyer Gloria Allred and a celebrity civil rights attorney in her own right, of trying to destroy McGowan\u2019s reputation. Weinstein had optioned a book written by Bloom and eventually retained her at a rate of $895 per hour, according to \u201cShe Said,\u201d a book by New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey.\n\n\u201cI feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them,\u201d Bloom wrote in a December 2016 email to Weinstein, according to \u201cShe Said.\u201d \u201cThey start out impressive, bold women, but the more one presses for evidence, the weaknesses and lies are revealed.\u201d\n\nBloom later told the reporters that representing Weinstein was a \u201ccolossal mistake.\u201d But this week, Bloom\u2019s attorney, Eric George, told Variety that McGowan\u2019s decision to include Bloom in her lawsuit was \u201cinexcusable.\u201d\n\n\u201cFacts matter,\u201d George said. \u201cThere is simply no credible factual or legal basis for her claims against my client. We look forward to our day in court to set the record straight.\u201d\n\nWeinstein's lawyer Phyllis Kupferstein also denounced the complaint.\n\n\"Once and for all, Rose McGowan will be shown to be what she is; a publicity seeker looking for money,\" she told the Hollywood Reporter. \"From the moment she sought a multi-million dollar payout in return for not making these baseless allegations, which we rejected, we knew that she was waiting for an opportune time to begin this. We will demonstrate that this case has no legal merit.\u201d\n\nWeinstein is now awaiting trial on charges related to allegations of sexual assault. He has previously denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.\n\nBoies\u2019 law firm did not immediately respond to a VICE News request for comment.\n\nCover image: In this Oct. 27, 2017, file photo, actress Rose McGowan speaks at the inaugural Women's Convention in Detroit.
