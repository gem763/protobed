The match grants her the chance to take home her 24th Grand Slam singles title, tying Margaret Court for the all-time record.\n\nIn addition to the glory, there's also prize money on the line: If Williams clinches the title on Saturday, she'll earn $3.85 million.\n\nBut though her career has been lucrative, Williams doesn't blow through cash. In fact, after earning her first million, Williams didn't touch any of the money \u2014 she deposited it directly in the bank and walked away.\n\n\"I remember, I went through the drive-through to deposit my check, and they were like, 'I think you need to come in for this,'\" she recalled in a 2017 interview with Uninterrupted, a media company owned by LeBron James and Maverick Carter.\n\nWilliams said that, for her, tennis has never been about getting paid. She's always played for the love of the game. Early in her career, she would forget to collect her paychecks at all.\n\n\"When I first turned pro, you had to go pick up your check,\" she said. \"I never, never picked it up, so at the end of the year, the tournament directors would literally hand me the check because I would never go get it.\"", "description": "Tennis star Serena Williams could take home her 24th Grand Slam title on Saturday, tying for the all-time record.
