Now, I take it everywhere I go so Tanya is always with me.\u201d\n\nTanya, 53, wrote the card in July, as her life slipped away, to give Vinnie strength in the days after her death from cancer.\n\nThe actor said: \u201cShe left it with her precious diaries.\n\n\u201cInside she had written: \u2018To my love Vin, something wonderful happens to me every day. It\u2019s being with you. You are my morning sunshine the moment I wake. All my love, Tanya.\u2019\n\n\"I broke down when I read it because I loved her like that too.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\nSobbing, Vinnie said he is counting the days until he is reunited with the love of his life.\n\nAnd he has bought an adjacent cemetery plot so his ashes can be buried alongside Tanya\u2019s.\n\nTanya endured a six-year battle after being diagnosed with melanoma in 2013 but last year it spread to her brain.\n\nIn today\u2019s Sunday Mirror, 54-year-old Vinnie revealed he believes he was visited by her spirit in the hours after her death in July.\n\nHe now believes she is waiting for him in the afterlife.\n\nVinnie said: \u201cI\u2019m content to crash through the rest of my life in Heaven\u2019s waiting room until Tanya calls me.\n\n\"The rest of my life is not a long time if we are going to be together for eternity.\n\n\u201cBut I want to live to do the right thing by our daughter, Kaley, and Tanya\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019ll call me when the time is right.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\nVinnie and Tanya met when they were children in their hometown of Watford.\n\nHe said: \u201cI can\u2019t remember if I fancied her straight away but she was always very striking.\u201d\n\nBut the pair never got together until after Tanya\u2019s first marriage to footballer Steve Terry broke down.\n\nBy then, issues with her health were already beginning to loom.\n\nShe almost died in childbirth with Kaley, who Vinnie later adopted, and had to have an emergency heart transplant.\n\nWhen he asked Tanya\u2019s dad Lou, now 82, if he could marry her, he warned him life would be difficult because of her health. But he was unperturbed.\n\nVinnie recalled: \u201cLou asked me if I knew what I was taking on because Tanya was not a well lady. But I promised him I loved her and that never changed and never will.\u201d\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\nTanya never spoke about dying or her wishes for her funeral throughout her fight.\n\nVinnie added: \u201cI begged doctors not to tell her she was nearing the end when things got really bad.\n\n\u201cWe just couldn\u2019t talk about her dying because I just couldn\u2019t accept it.\u201d\n\nBut that tragic moment did arrive.\n\nSpeaking of Tanya\u2019s funeral, Vinnie said: \u201cHundreds packed into our local church in LA, where we had built our life, to say goodbye. Another memorial was held in the UK, she was so loved.\u201d\n\nTanya was cremated and her ashes buried in LA\u2019s Forest Lawn Cemetery.\n\nVinnie said. \u201cThere\u2019s a tree next to her plot for Kaley to sit under. I\u2019ve already bought the plot next to her so my ashes can be buried there too, and we can be together forever.\u201d\n\n(Image: ExpressStar)\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nTanya died weeks after the couple\u2019s 25th wedding anniversary in June, which she spent in intensive care.\n\nThey had planned to mark the occasion by flying family and friends from the UK for a New Year\u2019s Eve party in LA but Tanya didn\u2019t make it.\n\nVinnie said: \u201cWhile Tanya was going through chemo, she\u2019d stop treatment for a month so she could enjoy Christmas.\n\n\"But she always had to have something to look forward to and she wanted to celebrate our anniversary on New Year\u2019s Eve. She booked all the flights.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going ahead with the plans. It will be tough but it\u2019s what she would have wanted.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nThe festive period for Vinnie will also be tainted with sad memories.\n\nIt was last Christmas Eve, the couple received a call from Tanya\u2019s doctor, who broke the dreadful news the cancer had spread to her brain.\n\nVinnie said: \u201cWe broke down in each other\u2019s arms. It was the first time we really both broke down. That was when Tanya knew it could be her last Christmas.\n\n\"She said, \u2018I want to have a fantastic Christmas, what can they do?\u2019 The doctors gave her steroids. She was hugging friends and family and saying, \u2018Every moment is precious.\u2019 I think they maybe knew.\u201d\n\nFormer Wimbledon star Vinnie quit booze nearly seven years ago, when Tanya was diagnosed, but he insisted he hasn\u2019t been tempted to go back, even in his darkest days.\n\nHe said: \u201cI was a binge drinker, not an alcoholic. But Tanya stood by me.\n\n\u201cIt hurt me so much when I let her down. Friends might have been scared I would go off at the deep end with drink but I don\u2019t even think about it.\u201d\n\nWhenever he misses his true love the most, Vinnie knows he only has to reach for the card to feel her by his side once more.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The former football legend and actor 'broke down' at discovering the final love letter from his wife, written before she died aged 53", "authors": ["Halina Watts", "Image", "Tim Merry", "Press Association", "Expressstar", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20524713.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Vinnie-Jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
