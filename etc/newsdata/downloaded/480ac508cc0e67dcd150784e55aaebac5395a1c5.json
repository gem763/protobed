Biden is too much like twice-failed candidate Hillary Clinton to win the 2020 election against President Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want to say it out loud,\u201d the \u201cFahrenheit 11/9\u201d director told MSNBC on Tuesday. \u201cJoe Biden is the center. Joe Biden is this year\u2019s Hillary. Joe Biden is not going to excite the base to get out there and vote on November 3rd, 2020.\u201d\n\nMr. Moore, who was one of the few prominent voices to correctly predict a 2016 election victory for Mr. Trump, said the Democratic nominee would have to be able to mobilize women, people of color and young people in order to beat the president in 2020. He\u2019s previously expressed support for candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernard Sanders of Vermont.\n\nOn Wednesday\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Mr. Moore said \u201cit\u2019s possible\u201d for Mr. Trump to pull off an election win if the Democrats take too long with their impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats go to do Mueller 2, that ain\u2019t going to play well, and they\u2019re going to lose the momentum that they need,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
