More tainted blood pressure medicines may be added to carcinogens lawsuit", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Blood Pressure Medication was recalled because they might contain an impurity believed to cause cancer. Veuer's Sam Berman has the full story. Buzz60\n\nLawyers for consumers who claim harm from tainted versions of the blood pressure-lowering drug valsartan want to expand litigation to include at least two other drugs, losartan and irbesartan.\n\nDozens of consumers have already filed personal-injury lawsuits around the country claiming they were diagnosed with cancer or sustained other injuries after taking valsartan contaminated with probable carcinogens.\n\nA federal court panel this year consolidated the valsartan lawsuits, which were filed against China-based drug ingredient manufacturer, Zhejiang Huahai, and more than three dozen other distributors, wholesalers, repackagers and pharmacies.\n\nLawyers representing consumers and employers that paid for the drugs argue losartan and irbesartan should be part of the combined federal lawsuit.\n\nBut the drug companies have said in court papers the effort to combine the other sartan medications, which are part of a class of several drugs called angiotensin II receptor blockers, would be \"wholly inappropriate.\"\n\nBlood pressure drug recall: FDA investigates foreign plants that made drugs with cancer-causing impurities\n\nA federal judge is expected to hear arguments from both sides as soon as Dec. 5.\n\nDrug companies recalled hundreds of lots of the commonly-prescribed blood pressure and heart medications valsartan, losartan and irbesartan \u2014 alone or combined with other drugs \u2014 after testing revealed the drugs contained NDMA, or nitrosodimethylamine, a probable carcinogen. Follow-up testing showed some batches of valsartan had another probable carcinogen, nitrosodiethylamine, or NDEA. A third impurity, NMBA, also was discovered.\n\nIf a federal judge agrees to add losartan and irbesartan to the consolidated lawsuit, the effort could significantly expand the litigation against drug makers, distributors and sellers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a far broader and more widespread problem than even we understood at the outset,\u201d said Paul Geske, whose Chicago-area law firm, McGuire Law, sought to consolidate the separate lawsuits. \u201cWhen you have a situation with numerous cases dispersed throughout the country, this is the only way to efficiently bring them all to one court.\u201d\n\nDo you have high blood pressure? It depends on which doctor you ask\n\nAttorney: 3 to 5 million consumers affected\n\nThe FDA said valsartan made with contaminated ingredients may have gone undetected for up to four years. The FDA announced the first recall in July 2018. The NDMA contamination is expected to create one more cancer case above average rates for every 8,000 people on the highest dose of valsartan for four years, according to the FDA.\n\nDaniel Nigh, a Pensacola, Florida, attorney and one of four co-lead attorneys representing consumers, said millions of consumers are potentially affected.\n\n\"When you boil it down to the recalls, the number of people who may have taken recalled valsartan, or contaminated valsartan, certainly seems to be higher than 3 million people,\" Nigh said. \"It might be as high as 5 million people.\"\n\nSome people on valsartan when the recall began were switched to losartan, only to learn months later the replacement drug also was recalled due to contamination concerns.\n\n\"So they got double dinged,\" Nigh said.\n\nFDA: Recalled blood pressure drugs linked to cancer risk OK to take short-term\n\nNigh expects as many as 2,000 people will pursue personal-injury lawsuits linking the medication to cancer. He says he represents 500 people diagnosed with cancer after taking valsartan and another 100 on recalled versions of losartan and irbesartan.\n\nThe consolidated case will pursue three legal tracks. One involves consumers who claim injury from taking the drug. Another will seek compensation for ongoing medical monitoring. A third, which will include third-party employers and insurers that paid for the drugs, will claim economic loss.\n\nIn a September court filing, lawyers representing Zhejiang Huahai and three related companies argue there are comparatively small number of losartan and irbesartan cases. The attorneys want the court to reject a request to include other yet-to-be-discovered contaminants in other sartan drugs.\n\nHowever, lawyers representing consumers argue the losartan and irbesartan cases \u2014and potentially other sartan drugs \u2014 will share common methods to discover facts such as production records, inspection reports and sales data. The cases also will rely on the same experts on manufacturing and whether the drugs caused injuries, so combining the cases would be convenient and efficient, the lawyers said in court papers.\n\nHave you been affected by the blood pressure medication recalls?
