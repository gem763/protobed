I feel really good watching this. So many games you've played like this, you've had this kind of racial thing going on and people saying, 'yeah just beat them on the pitch', it doesn't do anything.\n\n\"Don't beat them on the pitch, don't score two goals, they'll still give you racist abuse, you don't win.\n\n\"Today they won [England's players], they won today, because they [the Bulgaria fans] had to leave.\"\n\nEngland were two goals to the good when the abuse started, following goals from Marcus Rashford and Ross Barkley.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nDebutant Tyrone Mings was one of those on the receiving end of the abuse, complaining to the linesman which filtered its way back to the bench, prompting the first stoppage.\n\nEngland scored twice more before the half ended, through Barkley and Raheem Sterling, but the abuse continued, before a final warning was given to Bulgaria as part of UEFA's new procedure.\n\nWright added: \"Tyrone Mings - this could've been the day, had we not had the protocol, that his debut would have been marred with for being a racial incident. It would've finished like that for him - that doesn't happen no more.\n\n\"I feel for the Bulgarian people I genuinely do, but you've got to look at the banners, other side of the stadium half closed down - it does nothing.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"We've said it for many years, UEFA do not really deep down care about the kind of punishment they put out.\n\n\"This should've been in place 10, 20 years ago. Now we've seen what's happened, what's good about it is we've got a generation of players now, not just black players, a generation of players, of people that won't tolerate it no more.\"\n\nEngland ran out eventual 6-0 winners after Sterling netted his second before Harry Kane rounded off the scoring.\n\nFA chairman Greg Clarke condemned the racial abuse after the match, but commended the nature of the England's players' performance.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"I was up in the stands. We heard some sounds which sounded like monkey chanting,\" Clarke said. \"It was appalling.\n\n\u201cWe were told by officials that 50 people in the corner were causing the trouble and had been thrown out at half-time. There will now be investigation.\n\n\u201cWe have to be so proud of our players and the squad around them and how they stood up to abject racism.\"", "description": "The Three Lions players were on the receiving end of racist abuse during their qualifier against Bulgaria", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Sportimage", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581321.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-A-Bulgaria-v-England.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
