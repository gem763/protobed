'Fred comes in the back door. He says to Rose, \"come on Rosie you know what we\u2019ve got between us.\"\n\nRose West's mother Daisy Letts, from the UK, has revealed her daughter would cry every time she visited her in the mid-70s. Pictured, Rosemary West in 1995\n\nDaisy told how Rose would say her husband Fred West was 'working' every time she visited. Pictured, Fred West in 1995\n\nShe continued: 'And Rosie, she\u2019s never sort of talked a lot, she never made a conversation. She turned to her father who stood there and Fred stood at the back door.'\n\n'She said, \"you don\u2019t know him. There\u2019s nothing he wouldn\u2019t do she said, including murder.\"'\n\nWhile the chilling words ring out like a warning now, Daisy thought Rose was just overwrought - when in fact, Fred had already murdered.\n\nGoing back to the early years, Rose had a seemingly joyless childhood, lacking the small pleasures most families take for granted.\n\n'She was a model baby,' explained Daisy. 'She was lovely. She never cried. She would play in her pram for hours.'\n\nDaisy, who has no photos of her family in her house now, confirmed baby Rose rocked herself so vigorously she would move her pram across the floor - but admitted she never asked a doctor about it as she just 'thought it was a habit.'\n\nHowever, rhythmic movement disorder can be an indication of developmental problems - though there's no medical evidence this was the case with Rose.\n\nThe home of serial killers Fred and Rosemary West, where several of their victims bodies were found\n\nPolice removing evidence from 25 Cromwell Street in Gloucester following the murders in 1994\n\nIn the podcast, Daisy also remembered visiting her daughter in the mid-70s with her husband, Fred West.\n\nShe told how she knew her daughter had been crying before most of her visits in the mid-70s - but added she would never tell her why.\n\n'Dad used to say we'll go and see if she\u2019s alright,' said Daisy. 'We used to go over there. Most of the time she\u2019d been crying but she would never tell us what was wrong.'\n\n'Her eyes were always red and you could see she\u2019d been crying. Dad used to say to me, \"I'd like to know what is going on.\"'\n\n'We used to say where\u2019s Fred? And every time we\u2019d ask where Fred was she\u2019d say he\u2019s working. Dad used to say to me, \"he's not working at this time of night.\"'\n\nBut when the interviewer suggested Rose wasn't happy with Fred because 'she tried to leave him and she was crying,' Daisy jumped in and continued:\n\nThe crimes of Rose and Fred West The Wests, who lived at the house from 1972 until their arrests in 1994, regularly took on lodgers in the property, which was also home to ten of their children. To supplement their income, Rose would solicit to both men and women in one of the upstairs bedrooms, while Fred would watch through peep holes. Rose West, 65, was convicted of 10 murders and is one of a very few female prisoners serving a whole life tariff. Her husband, Fred, confessed the killings in 1994 and committed suicide while on remand at HMP Birmingham a year later. The victims include Heather West (their daughter), 16, Alison Chambers, 16, Shirley Robinson, 18, Juanita Mott, 18, Shirley Hubbard, 15, Theresa Siegnethaler, 21, Lucy Partington, 21, Carol Ann Cooper, 15, Lynda Gough, 19, Rena Costello (Fred\u2019s ex-wife), 27, Charmaine West (Fred\u2019s daughter), 8, and Anne McFall, 18. Fred is also believed to have also killed 15-year-old Mary Bastholm, although her remains have never been found.\n\n'No she was this is the funny thing I can\u2019t make out. Whether it was just her way or whether she didn\u2019t want us to know she wasn\u2019t happy I don\u2019t know.'\n\n'As time went by, the later years, she seemed happier. She would say she was happy. I mean, would someone who was involved in someone like that say, \"I\u2019m happy mum?\" That\u2019s how she said it to me.'\n\nDaisy also recalled the final time the West family came to visit in the early 1990s.\n\n'There was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, there was eight of them without Fred and her,' she explained. 'I just made tea and cut and made some sandwiches and then they went after that. '\n\nShe continued: 'I just asked her if she\u2019d heard from Heather. She turned away and walked across the room and she said \"no... she\u2019s off with her cronies.\"\n\nUnheard: The Fred & Rose West Tapes with Howard Sounes is available weekly on Apple, Spotify and all podcast providers", "description": "Daisy Letts opened up about her daughter Rose West's childhood on episode five of the podcast Unheard: The Fred and Rose West Tapes, which is released today.", "authors": ["Chloe Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/14/19443246-0-image-a-41_1570541376238.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
