In a memo to staff, Cook said the app was being removed because it was being used to \"maliciously target individual officers for violence.\"\n\nHe said he had received \"credible information\" from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that violence of this nature was taking place. Prior to Apple's decision to remove the app, the Chinese state newspaper, China Daily, had criticized Apple for allowing the app on the App Store.\n\nRead more: Hong Kong lawmaker who relied on the banned HKMap Live app warns Apple from becoming an 'accomplice for Chinese censorship'\n\nCook's decision came despite considerable outcry from US lawmakers about Apple kowtowing to Chinese censorship.\n\nA prominent Hong Kong lawmaker, Charles Mok, penned an open letter on Twitter criticizing the decision, saying: \"I sincerely hope that Apple will choose to support its users and stop banning HKmap.live simply out of political reason [sic] or succumbing to China's influence like other American companies appear to be doing.\"\n\nXiao Yaqing is the head of China's market regulator.
