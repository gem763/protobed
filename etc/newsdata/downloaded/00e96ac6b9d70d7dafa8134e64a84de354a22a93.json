Players all across the country are urged to check their tickets as soon as possible.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe Euromillions jackpot has rolled over 22 consecutive times since July 19, first reaching the maximum prize fund of \u00a3170m (\u20ac190m) on September 24.\n\nUnder jackpot cap rules, the top prize can roll over four consecutive times once the cap has been reached, before it must be won in the fifth and final draw, which happened on Tuesday.\n\nIf no one had won the jackpot by matching five numbers plus two Lucky Stars, the entire jackpot would have rolled down to the next highest tier, most likely where five numbers and one Lucky star are matched.\n\nIt is the first time that a jackpot has gone the full five draws at its cap and only the second time that a Must Be Won draw has ever been held; the first was on November 17, 2006.\n\nTickets for Euromillions are sold in nine countries - the UK, France, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Irish Republic, Portugal and Switzerland - with ticket-holders in all those countries trying to win a share of the same jackpot each week.\n\nPrevious UK winners\n\n1.
