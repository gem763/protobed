But instead of addressing the animal cruelty, the authorities are terrorising vegan families and sending their companion animals to slaughter.'\n\nKnickers is heavier than A Mini Cooper (2640lbs/1,200kg)\n\nThree clones of racehorse Winx\n\nA black rhinoceros\n\nAU$140 million in stacked AU$100 notes or AU$155,000 in AU$1 coins\n\nA beluga whale\n\n9,300 potatoes\n\nAn entire rugby league team\n\nWhite Rocks owner Michael Partridge said he was 'amazed with the lies [the activists] tell' and denied Lucky was ever mistreated on his farm.\n\n'Our farm has been open on many occasions to show our production system. We've got nothing to hide here.'\n\nWarden and Sobianina admitted to trespassing on to White Rocks and another farm late last year, but not guilty to stealing the $1,500 calf along with a piglet from another property.\n\nThe ongoing case means Lucky has teamed up with Knickers on Mr Pearson's farm for the foreseeable future, where the record-breaking steer is dealing with his celebrity.\n\nKnickers will make his first public appearance at the Brunswick Agricultural Show, near Bunbury, on Saturday, where families can get up close to him for a $2 donation.\n\n'It's quite daunting being up close to him, he's far bigger than any other steer I've had. But he's very placid, not aggressive, just inquisitive,' Mr Pearson said.\n\nKnickers' massive 70lbs-a-day (30kg) diet is a mix of natural green pasture and rations of cereal grain that helped him be a standout steer from an early age\n\nKnickers is only slightly shorter than Mr Pearson's son Tex, 17, (left) who stands at 6ft 7in (204cm), and is even taller when measuring to the top of the massive beast's head\n\nAll proceeds go to the Blue Tree Project, which helps farmers battling mental illness brought on by the crippling drought.\n\nGetting Knickers to the show will be a tough task as during a trial run this weekend it became clear he was far too big to fit on Mr Pearson's truck trailer.\n\nThe enormous animal is so big, double the weight and half a metre taller than an average Holstein Friesian steer, that he was too big to be slaughtered in an abattoir and made into steaks.\n\nHis massive 70lbs-a-day (30kg) diet is a mix of natural green pasture and rations of cereal grain, but his gargantuan size is mostly the result of genetics.\n\nKnickers will make his first public appearance at the Brunswick Agricultural Show, near Bunbury, on Saturday, but getting him there will be a tough task as during a trial run it became clear he was far too big to fit on Mr Pearson's truck trailer\n\nKnickers is so big, double the weight and half a metre taller than an average Holstein Friesian steer, that he was too big to be made into steaks and lives out his life as king of the herd\n\nKnickers was only slightly shorter than Mr Pearson's son Tex, 17, who stands 6ft 7in (204cm), and is even taller when measuring to the top of the massive beast's head.\n\nVets said steers grew to be far bigger than bulls because they were castrated young and don't go through the hormonal changes that stop bulls growing.\n\nThe world's tallest living steer, or bovine of any kind, is an Italian chianina ox called Bellino that stands just over two metres, and the heaviest ever weighed 5,000lbs (2,267kg).\n\nA South Australian Guernsey steer named Big Moo was the previous Australian record holder but only came up to 6ft 2in (190cm).", "description": "Knickers, a massive 6ft 4in steer weighing 1,400kg living as king of the herd on a Western Australia farm, is Australia's biggest bovine and showing his tiny protege Lucky the ropes.", "authors": ["Nic White For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/04/20018068-0-image-a-31_1571714991952.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
