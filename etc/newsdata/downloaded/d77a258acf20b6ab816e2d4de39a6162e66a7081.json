She clung to a target of net immigration of 100,000 a year which was never met. She was responsible for the \u201chostile environment\u201d policy that gave us the injustices of so many of the Windrush generation.\n\nAnd for all her pronouncements about trafficking and slavery, the container-coffin on the Waterglade Industrial Park suggests that her government had failed to make much progress in curtailing this inhuman trade.\n\nYours,\n\nJohn Rentoul\n\nChief political commentator", "description": "For more than three years, Britain\u2019s attempt to leave the EU has been the dominant news story for political journalists, and the coverage has been particularly intense over the past four months.\u00a0 But the discovery of 39 bodies in a container lorry in Essex cut through the obsession with treaty clauses and parliamentary procedure like a shock of lightning, suddenly making", "authors": ["John Rentoul"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/19/lorry-essex.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
