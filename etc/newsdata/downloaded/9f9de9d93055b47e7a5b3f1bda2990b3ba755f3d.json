While more apps have been updated to support iOS 13's system-wide dark mode, there are still plenty of holdouts. No one likes being blinded by an app with bright UI elements while using dark mode \u2014 but luckily, you can force all apps to use an ersatz \u201cdark mode\u201d even if they don\u2019t officially have one by using the iOS 13's \u201cSmart Invert\u201d setting.\n\nSmart Invert is an iOS accessibility option that inverts the colours of your device\u2019s screen. Unlike the \u201cClassic Invert\u201d setting \u2014 which makes everything look like a photo negative \u2014 iOS 13\u2019s smart invert only applies to certain apps and UI elements rather than the whole screen and leaves important icons, images, and text (mostly) unchanged.\n\nThis means that if an app has a brightly coloured interface, smart invert will change it to a darker colour, while apps that already have a dark mode theme applied will remain untouched \u2014 unless a part of the app\u2019s dark mode interface is white/brightly-coloured, in which case that, too, will be made even darker.\n\nSmart Invert has been present in previous iterations of iOS, but results were inconsistent between apps in those older versions. However, now that iOS has an official dark mode setting, smart invert works much better and can help maintain the \u201cdark mode\u201d aesthetic across all your apps.\n\nTo turn on Smart Invert, go to Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size, then scroll down and turn on \u201cSmart Invert.\u201d\n\nAgain, Smart Invert tries to be \u201csmart\u201d about the colours it changes, but some apps may end up looking strange or become difficult to use if certain colours were changed (or weren\u2019t changed, in some cases). If you have any issues, simply turn off Smart Invert, restart the app in question, and things should go back to normal.\n\nYou can try using the \u201cAuto-Brightness\u201d and \u201cReduce Whitepoint\u201d settings under Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size to make brighter colours less glaring as well. Sure, these settings are not always perfect, but they make decent workarounds while we wait for all our favourite apps to adopt a dark mode.", "description": "It\u2019s been a few days since iOS 13 arrived and brought its system-wide dark theme to iPhones, and already the list of apps that support the new dark UI  has expanded beyond the initial batch.
