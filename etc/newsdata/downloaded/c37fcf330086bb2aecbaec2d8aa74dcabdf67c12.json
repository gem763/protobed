Outside this period, lodges and toilets are shut yet climbing is not prohibited.\n\nBut rescue team chief Kuniyasu Suzuki at the Shizuoka police warned that off-season weather conditions were severe.\n\n\"Live broadcasting while climbing is dangerous as it could distract you. You should never do it,\" he told national broadcaster NHK.\n\nSnow-capped for most of the year, the mountain's summit is regarded as dangerous during the off-season due to its steep slopes and constant gusts.\n\nThe conical-shaped mountain, some 100 kilometres (60 miles) west of Tokyo, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2013.", "description": "Rescuers in Japan are searching for a man who appears to have fallen down part of Mount Fuji as he was live-streaming his climb up the country's highest...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/10/wire-20369846-1572432204-136_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
