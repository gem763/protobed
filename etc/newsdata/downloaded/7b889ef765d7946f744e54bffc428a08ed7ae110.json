With no experience in Ukraine or in energy, Hunter scores a $50,00 a month \u2014 a month! \u2014 sweetheart deal from the company.\n\nJoe Biden is put in charge of handling an issue with China, so Hunter bums a ride with dad on Air Force Two, has his Chinese business partner meet his dad for a sweet photo-op, and then a company he has a ten percent stake in closes a $1.5 billion \u2014 with a \u201cB\u201d \u2014 investment deal with the Bank of China, which is a subsidiary of the communist Chinese government.\n\nYou know, when most presidential kin cash in on their famous and powerful relatives, it\u2019s stuff like Billy Beer, or at least it\u2019s unrelated to the very same countries the famous politician has been put in charge of. There is at least an attempt by these greedy and shameless relatives to create a degree of separation or two.\n\nIf Hunter had cashed in like most political relatives, he would be co-hosting The View or co-owner of a sports team or doing nothing for a sweet monthly salary at NBC News or some political action committee.\n\nBut Joe Biden is so arrogant, and Barack Obama so arrogant, and Hunter Biden so greedy, he couldn\u2019t cash in with those few degrees of separation. No, he had to follow his old man around picking up the scraps, even if it meant getting into bed with nothing less than Chinese government.\n\nAnd yet, Hunter\u2019s ONLY regret is Giuliani and Trump calling him and his father out for one of the single most glaring conflicts of interest in the history of the republic?!?!\n\nThe arrogance of Joe and Hunter Biden to believe they can get away with this is only possible in a country where the establishment media is as corrupt as it is in this country.\n\nPart of me feels bad for any 49-year-old man with a famous father who will never know for sure if his success is his own \u2014 if he is truly his own man. But Hunter Biden is not that man. His behavior is as pathetic and greedy as it is outrageously brazen and corrupt.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
