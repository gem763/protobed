Domestic pork prices have surged and China\u2019s meat imports are swelling in response, straining global supplies and sending ripples across the global economy.\n\nIn Brazil, poultry shipments to China have jumped 31% from a year ago and retail prices for chicken breasts, thighs and legs have increased roughly 16%. Shoppers in Europe are on average paying 5% more for pork, because more domestically produced meat is being sent to China. Lamb prices in Australian grocery stores have jumped 14%, while ground beef on shelves in New Zealand now fetches record prices.\n\nMeaty Issue A swine disease that has wiped out more than a third of China\u2019s hogs has left a huge pork shortfall. In 2018, China\u2019s pork consumption was 122 billion pounds Nearly double Europe\u2019s and the U.S. combined. U.S.: 21 EU: 47 Pork production in China has been stable... 2016: 119 billion pounds 2017: 120 2018: 119 ...but African swine fever hit forecasts. 2019*: 89 billion pounds 2020*: 76 Analists expect Chinese pork production shortfalls in 2019. Fitch Solutions\u2019 forecast: 36 billion pounds USDA: 13 As a result, China can increase meat imports. Total global meat exports in 2018 74 billion pounds Pork: 18\n\nChina\u2019s world-wide hunt for meat means that in Melton Mowbray, a British town of some 27,000 people known for its pork pies, prices for the thick-crusted pastries are going up. The U.K.\u2019s Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, a farmer-funded body, in September said Chinese demand helped push domestic hog prices to their highest level since November 2017.\n\nOne of the town\u2019s bakeries, Dickinson & Morris, has increased prices of pies filled with uncured British pork by 10% to 15% to \u00a33.99 ($4.98) for an individual pie, to help offset a 26% rise in wholesale meat prices.\n\n\u201cThere is just not enough pork around,\u201d said Stephen Hallam, managing director of the company, which sells about 4,000 pork pies a week at its store and distributes them to other retailers.\n\nChina\u2019s heavy buying is the result of the country\u2019s yearlong struggle to control the spread of the deadly African swine fever virus, which has led many farmers to cull hog herds and stop breeding new pigs. The country is now facing a historic pork shortfall while it remains locked in a trade war with the U.S., whose food and agriculture exports to China have plunged following rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs.\n\nAmerican shoppers so far haven\u2019t felt much price impact from China\u2019s meat purchases, but that could soon change. December-dated U.S. lean hog futures have climbed 4.5% so far this month, rising after Chinese officials said the country could exempt U.S. pork and some other agricultural goods from punitive tariffs, though President Trump on Friday said the U.S. didn\u2019t need to complete a trade agreement with China before the 2020 election.\n\nMany U.S. meat companies watched over the past year as competitors in Europe and South America raced to supply China\u2019s pork needs. In time, executives of Tyson Foods Inc., TSN -0.88% Smithfield Foods and Sanderson Farms Inc. SAFM -0.10% said they expect to benefit from higher prices, as China\u2019s rising imports draw down global meat supplies.\n\nPork pie prices are rising in British town Melton Mowbray, where Stephen Hallam, managing director of Dickinson & Morris bakery, posed in 2016 with the pastries.

The vast majority of that has previously been sourced locally. Analysts are now estimating that swine fever will cut China\u2019s pork production by as much as 35.7 billion pounds in 2019\u2014which is almost double the amount of pork traded internationally last year.\n\nAs domestic pork prices have jumped as much as 50%, there have been some attempts by Chinese government officials to ration pork or encourage people to buy chicken and other meats instead.\n\nBetween May and July, Chinese imports of pork, chicken, beef and sheep meat jumped nearly 70%, totaling more than $5 billion in value, pushing up meat prices around the world. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s global meat price index, which takes in price movements of beef, sheep meat, pork and poultry, has climbed 10% this year to its highest level since early 2015.\n\nIn Brazil, Beijing officials recently approved an additional 25 meat processing factories to export meat to China, increasing the number of export-certified Brazilian meat plants to 89\u2014including a donkey-processing facility\u2014according to a statement by the Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply.\n\nBRF SA, BRFS 1.66% one of Brazil\u2019s largest meat processors and poultry exporters, is increasing export capacity of pork and chicken by about 30% in part to meet Chinese demand while keeping the local market supplied.\n\nChinese importers are looking to buy three times the amount of meat they usually purchase, said Patricio Rohner, BRF\u2019s international vice president. Brazilian consumers are paying more for chicken as a result and further price increases are possible, he said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How will China\u2019s meat-buying affect U.S. consumers? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn neighboring Argentina, where many consider beef a way of life, some locals are going without the red meat as prices surge. A combination of inflation and soaring exports to China\u2014beef shipments more than doubled this year, while poultry climbed 68%\u2014have pushed steak prices 51% higher compared with a year ago, according to industry data.\n\nAt Cafe Anselmo, a restaurant in Buenos Aires\u2019 historic San Telmo neighborhood, menu prices for sirloin steaks and milanesa are one-fifth higher than they were at the beginning of the year, said manager Amorina Orosco. Some residents are buying less meat, and \u201call of us expect the prices are going to increase,\u201d she said.\n\nElPozo Alimentaci\u00f3n SA, one of Spain\u2019s largest pork companies, is making decisions about how much of the meat to supply to domestic markets and what to send to China, where it can get more money. In Spain, even cheaper cuts of meat\u2014such as pig trotters\u2014are disappearing from the local market because they can be sold for much more in China, said John Hickin, regional sales director in Asia for ElPozo.\n\nWorkers wearing protective suits sent pigs to be culled on Sept. 17 at a Paju, South Korea, farm where some have been confirmed with African swine fever.

Store manager Ron Bergan said lamb has become so expensive that the store can\u2019t pass all its cost increases on to customers without losing sales.\n\nInstead, he said, the store is reducing its profits. He is selling lamb cutlets for about $20.29 a pound\u2014roughly 10% more than a year ago.\n\n\u201cNothing is easy in the meat industry,\u201d said Mr. Bergan, noting that domestic supplies had already been tight after droughts reduced the size of Australian cow and sheep herds.\n\nWrite to Lucy Craymer at Lucy.Craymer@wsj.com and Jacob Bunge at jacob.bunge@wsj.com", "description": "China is scrambling to import meat after a swine disease hit hog farms across the country and decimated its pig herd.
