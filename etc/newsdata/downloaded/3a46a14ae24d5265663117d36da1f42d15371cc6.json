It has sustained winds of 250km an hour and gusts nearly 305km an hour.\n\nIt is already equivalent to a strong Category 5 Atlantic hurricane and is expected to strengthen over the next 24 hours with winds touching 260km an hour.\n\nThe storm is expected to continue northward before veering off to the northeast.\n\nMainland Japan appears to be most at risk from a direct impact from Hagibis. However, there is no clarity as to where the worst impact will be.\n\nHagibis will be weakening as it nears Japan because of the increasingly unfavourable upper-level winds. That said, it should still be a strong and dangerous typhoon.\n\nHonshu is likely to be the worst-hit. The latest projections take the eye of the storm right over Tokyo around 1800GMT on Saturday, which looks like a dreadful day for much of Honshu.\n\nThe storm could still be equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane by then with winds around 160km an hour gusting to 200km an hour.\n\nTherefore, there is a possibility of Hagibis affecting the World Cup rugby, particularly the two games taking place in Yokohama over the weekend.\n\nIt is likely to rain heavily for much of the day and 200-300mm of rain is possible by the weekend. One or two places could see even more.\n\nAlong with the damaging winds and torrential rain, large waves and storm surges are likely to cause life- threatening floods and possibly mudslides leading to widespread disruption.", "description": "From tropical storm to a Category 5 equivalent, Hagibis is one of the most explosive storms on record.", "authors": ["Everton Fox"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/294cc77039b642fa90b0d7f788106ac1_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
