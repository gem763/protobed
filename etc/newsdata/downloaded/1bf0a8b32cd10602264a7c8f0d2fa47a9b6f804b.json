Biden on Thursday said President Trump \u201csold out\u201d American-allied Kurdish fighters and \u201cbetrayed our word as a nation\u201d by giving way to a Turkish bombardment in northeast Syria.\n\nMr. Trump says he is trying to unwind endless wars in the Middle East and that he\u2019s talking to \u201cboth sides\u201d of the unfolding fight, though Mr. Biden joined much of Washington in upbraiding the commander-in-chief, saying the president moved American troops out of the way on a whim after speaking to \u201cfellow strongman\u201d Recip Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump sold out the Syrian Democratic Forces \u2014 the courageous Kurds and Arabs who fought with us to smash ISIS\u2019s caliphate \u2014 and he betrayed a key local ally in the fight against terrorism,\u201d Mr. Biden, a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, said in a four-paragraph statement.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not all \u2014 he betrayed our brave troops, who sacrificed alongside them,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cHe betrayed our word as a nation \u2014 raising doubts among our allies around the world about America\u2019s security commitments.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden this week called on House Democrats to impeach Mr. Trump. He also accused the president of smearing his family.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is pursuing an impeachment inquiry that centers on Mr. Trump\u2019s push to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, who had business ties in Ukraine through a gas company called Burisma Holdings.\n\nMr. Trump says Mr. Biden got Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who once looked into Burisma, though Mr. Biden says his push, part of a broader effort by the West, was aimed at ramping up corruption prosecutions \u2014 not getting Ukraine to back off.\n\nMr. Biden homed in on the Syria situation on Thursday, lambasting Mr. Trump for saying the Kurds didn\u2019t stand with Americans at Normandy during World War II.\n\n\u201cBy that standard, only Canada, a handful of European allies, and others could ever hope for America to come to their defense \u2014 and even they might have doubts after Trump\u2019s performance,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cEspecially when Trump said he wasn\u2019t worried about ISIS regrouping and fleeing Syria because they would only go to Europe.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump says he is the one cleaning up a faulty strategy pursued by his predecessors. He\u2019s also tired of taking responsibility for Islamic State detainees in lieu of Europe.\n\n\u201cThis is not about keeping forces in northern Syria indefinitely,\u201d Mr. Biden said in response. \u201cThat was never the plan. It\u2019s about consolidating our hard-fought gains against ISIS, and preventing it from regenerating \u2014 which it is already trying to do. Managing this complex environment requires smart and sustained diplomacy, which President Trump has demonstrated he has neither the patience nor the wisdom to conduct.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
