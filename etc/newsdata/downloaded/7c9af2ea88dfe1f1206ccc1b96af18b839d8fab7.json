But if there\u2019s one thing we all agree on, it\u2019s that nothing fits quite like a pair of classic Levi\u2019s, and 501s are about as classic as it gets. The cut is neither super-high-waisted nor low-rise. The legs are slim without being leggingslike, and the hem hits at the ankles, so they\u2019re not comically cropped. And unlike vintage Levi\u2019s, this particular pair of 501s is made with stretch denim, meaning you\u2019ll be able to comfortably sit in them for hours and never worry about them digging into your waist. Best of all, these Levi\u2019s jeans are on sale at Shopbop \u2014 part of its \u201csurprise sale,\u201d which is still going strong \u2014 for just $90, or 30 percent off the list price.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
