REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov\n\nThe United States has ramped up its efforts to persuade Ankara to halt the incursion against the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces, saying Ankara was causing \u201cgreat harm\u201d to ties and could face sanctions.\n\nTurkey opened its offensive after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke by phone on Sunday with Turkey\u2019s President Tayyip Erdogan and withdrew U.S. troops who had been fighting alongside Kurdish forces.\n\nOn Friday evening, Erdogan dismissed mounting international criticism of the operation and said Turkey \u201cwill not stop it, no matter what anyone says\u201d.\n\nOn the frontlines, thick plumes of smoke rose around Syria\u2019s Ras al Ain, one of two border towns targeted in the offensive, as Turkish artillery targeted the area on Saturday, said a Reuters reporter across the frontier in the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar.\n\nIntense gunfire also resounded from within the town of Ras al Ain itself, while warplanes could be heard flying overhead, he said.\n\nIt was quieter at Tel Abyad, the operation\u2019s other main target some 120 km (75 miles) to the west, with only occasional shell fire heard in the area, another Reuters reporter said.\n\nEarlier, the Pentagon said none of its soldiers were wounded in the Turkish artillery fire near Syria\u2019s Kobani, some 60 km (37 miles) west of the main area of conflict.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Defence Ministry said its forces did not open fire at the U.S. base and took all precautions to prevent any harm to it while it was responding to fire from a nearby area by the Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara regards as a terrorist group.\n\nA war monitor gave a death toll of more than 100 from the first days of the assault. The United Nations said 100,000 people had fled their homes.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Turkey\u2019s Defence Ministry said that 415 YPG militants had been \u201cneutralised\u201d since the operation began, a term that commonly means killed.\n\nISLAMIC STATE\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), with the Kurdish YPG as its main fighting element, now holds most of the territory that once made up Islamic State\u2019s \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria, and has been keeping thousands of fighters from the jihadist group in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nThe Kurdish militia say the Turkish assault could allow the jihadist group to re-emerge as some of its followers were escaping from prisons.\n\nIn its first big attack since the assault began on Tuesday, Islamic State claimed responsibility for a deadly car bomb in Qamishli, the largest city in the Kurdish-held area, even as the city came under Turkish shelling.\n\nFive Islamic State fighters fled a jail there, and foreign women from the group being held in a camp torched tents and attacked guards with sticks and stones, the SDF said.\n\nU.S. lawmakers introduced more legislation on Friday seeking stiff sanctions on Turkey over the offensive, underscoring unhappiness from both Democrats and President Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress over his Syria policy.\n\nU.S. military officials denied lawmakers\u2019 accusations that the Trump administration had abandoned U.S. allies to a Turkish military onslaught. Ankara says it aims to defeat the YPG, which it sees as an enemy for its links to militants who have fought a decades-old insurgency in Turkey.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump had authorized the drafting of \u201cvery significant\u201d new sanctions against Turkey, a NATO ally. Washington was not activating the curbs now but would do so if necessary, Mnuchin said.\n\nTurkey aims to set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria, where it can resettle many of the 3.6 million refugees it has been hosting. Erdogan threatened to send refugees to Europe if the European Union did not back his assault, prompting a furious response from the EU.\n\nFor a graphic on 'Where Kurds live', click here\n\nFor a graphic on 'Turkey hits Kurdish militia targets', click here", "description": "Turkish forces stepped up their bombardment around a town in northeast Syria on Saturday, the fourth day of an offensive against a Kurdish militia, after U.S. troops in the region came under artillery fire from Turkish positions.", "authors": ["Daren Butler", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1439976569&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B07O-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
