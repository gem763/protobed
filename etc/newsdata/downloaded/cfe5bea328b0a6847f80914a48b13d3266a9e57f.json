First, it allows commenting to happen in real-time, which enables much better conversation among our great audience. Spot.IM also has a newsfeed function, which recommends related articles on Townhall that the rest of the community is fired up about. The new system also has much less intrusive ads than Disqus. Spot.IM is just the first step in our master plan of improvements on the site over the next three months. So stay tuned!\n\nThe registration process for Spot.IM is fairly straightforward. The system is easy to use and will allow the discussion among readers to thrive and focus on what matters for us conservatives, while also making sure that the \"you can make $10,000 from home\" spammers are greatly reduced. Your Spot.IM account will also allow you to use the same login across the entire Townhall Media network, and if you already have a login on one of the sites we've previously launched on - HotAir, Twitchy, or Bearing Arms - you're already set to login!\n\nIf you have a Disqus account (which, if you're commenting on Townhall now, you do), you can easily keep the same username. Just follow these steps:\n\n1. Scroll to the bottom of an article and click on the \"Show Comments\" button. A login option for the new commenting system will appear. If you have a Disqus account, click \"Have a Disqus Account?\" to start the Spot.IM registration process.\n\n2. After clicking \"Have a Disqus Account?\" a new window will open where you will enter your current Disqus login information. Enter your Disqus username and password in the fields below and click \"Sign In and Accept.\"\n\n3. After entering your Disqus account information, the last window will appear to complete your Spot.IM registration. At the top, you will see that your Disqus username will be the username for your Spot.IM account. Fill in the email box with the email you would like to use for your Spot.IM account (it does not need to be the same email you used for Disqus). After entering your email, create your password and check the \"I'm not a robot\" box. Your registration is now complete!\n\nIf you do not have a Disqus account, please type your comment into the field, then hit \"Sign up to Post\", choose your preferred signup method, then complete the process and your registration is complete.\n\nWe invite you to register now and encourage you to engage with us as we all fight for conservative principles. Please let us know what you think!\n\nIf you have any issues, problems, or feedback, send an email to contact@townhallmedia.com - we'll be happy to help you out!", "description": ".09/04/2019 19:38:36PM EST.", "authors": ["Townhall.Com Staff", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/247/d03a25ad-52eb-4ef7-b3cc-0f397eeeb00b.png"}
