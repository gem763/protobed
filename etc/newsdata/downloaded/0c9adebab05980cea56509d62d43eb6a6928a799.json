Should President Trump get the time back he lost to the Deep State investigating his corrupt relationship with Russia?\n\nNormally, Trump would answer questions like this with a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d This morning, he phrased all of them as questions:\n\nGeneral Motors, which was once the Giant of Detroit, is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there. They moved major plants to China, BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE. This was done despite the saving help given them by the USA. Now they should start moving back to America again? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2019\n\nAn idea liked by many? https://t.co/Ev9uqa1hoj \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2019\n\nThe disastrous IG Report on James Comey shows, in the strongest of terms, how unfairly I, and tens of millions of great people who support me, were treated. Our rights and liberties were illegally stripped away by this dishonest fool. We should be given our stolen time back? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2019\n\nThe only one of these propositions Trump could even conceivably be wavering about is indexing of capital gains for inflation. But given the fact that he has retweeted a message urging him to cut capital gains, it seems highly unlikely he is actually questioning it.\n\nPossibly, in keeping with his new self-style image as King of the Jews, he has decided to adopt a Talmudic style of phraseology, presenting ideas as questions to be sorted through rather than his traditional exhortation. More likely, he has somehow mistakenly entered question marks in place of his trademark exclamation point.\n\nAnchorman is a movie about a local television personality with a Trumpian ego and brain, who at one point reads his sign-off as a question because somebody entered a question mark into the teleprompter by mistake.\n\nNow Trump has done it to himself? Three times?", "description": "President Trump has sent a series of tweets with question marks at the end, rather than exclamation points.
