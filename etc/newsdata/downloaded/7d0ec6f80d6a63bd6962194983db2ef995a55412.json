Chip and Joanna Gaines are opening a hotel.", "language": "en", "text": "HGTV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines announced on Thursday their next steps to help transform Waco, Tex., into a tourist destination: the 2021 opening of their own boutique hotel. The couple, best known for their home design and renovation show \u201cFixer Upper,\u201d shared the news through Joanna\u2019s blog and the couple\u2019s various social media accounts.\n\nThe Gaineses\u2019 \u201cdream\u201d for the hotel, Joanna wrote in a blog post, is for it to serve as \u201can extension of the way we feel about our own home and all it represents to us, and that every guest who comes to stay would experience that same sense of belonging and community.\"\n\nThe hotel will be located in downtown Waco, near the couple\u2019s other projects, such as the Magnolia Market shopping complex. Housed in a historical building that sprawls nearly 53,000 square feet, it will be a collaboration between the Gaineses and Adventurous Journeys Capital Partners, the private real estate company from Chicago behind such notable properties as the Soho House Chicago and the Chicago Athletic Association.\n\nThe hotel will be the first of its kind in the Central Texas city, although offerings are growing there. The couple already offers accommodation options dubbed \u201cMagnolia Stays\u201d for fans. The vacation rentals include the Carriage House, a three-bedroom fixer-upper that sleeps six with a weekday rate of $545; the Hillcrest Estate, a historical renovation that sleeps 12 with a weekday rate of $995; and the Magnolia House, a property in the town of McGregor that sleeps eight with a weekday rate of $795.\n\n\n\nA rendering of Chip and Joanna Gaines's new hotel in Waco, Tex. (From Magnolia)\n\nWaco\u2019s rise in popularity can at least partly be attributed to the Gaineses\u2019 influence. After the Waco-based \u201cFixer Upper\u201d started airing, in 2013, and after the couple opened Magnolia Market in 2015, the city noticed upticks in tourism.\n\n\u201cIn the last couple years, we get 20,000 to 30,000 people a week simply to discover the \u2018Fixer Upper\u2019 effect on Waco,\u201d said Todd A. Bertka, the director of the Waco Convention and Visitors Bureau. \u201cIt\u2019s sparked its own cottage industry. We\u2019ve had small businesses open and blossom in that period that have benefited from folks coming to visit Magnolia.\u201d\n\nIn addition to developing the hotel, the Gaineses are busy expanding Magnolia Market and building a coffee shop and furniture showroom while maintaining their other businesses. Despite that hectic schedule, the couple can be spotted around town from time to time.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re around and not invisible, but their schedule has them very busy, as you can imagine,\u201d Bertka said. \u201cThey recently attended a city council meeting in support of a project they\u2019re passionate about.\"\n\nBertka hopes that the Gaineses\u2019 projects, as well as the city\u2019s own independent developments, will keep stoking Waco\u2019s tourism momentum.\n\n\u201cTheir continued efforts here in Waco to show passion and interest in the town that they\u2019re from is a continual boost in the tourism world,\u201d Bertka said. \u201cThese things will continue to keep us on the map and in the minds of folks who want to travel and discover Waco as a destination.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA couple was scammed by a $12,000 Airbnb listing.
