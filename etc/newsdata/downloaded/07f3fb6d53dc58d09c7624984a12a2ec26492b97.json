HBO Go. Hulu. Amazon Prime. Pretty Soon It All Adds Up", "language": "en", "text": "The last time Netflix asked me \u201cAre you still watching?\u201d I had to think really hard about it. Was I still watching? Or at least enough to make my $16-a-month payment worth it?\n\nThe subscription economy can be a wonderful thing. We don\u2019t have to pay for lots of stuff we don\u2019t want. The monthly price is usually pretty low. And it gives us an incentive to watch things that we might otherwise avoid because they are too expensive on a per-item basis.\n\nBut there\u2019s a big downside as well, especially when it comes to the video world. It\u2019s called subscription creep.\n\nIt can happen fast. Maybe you\u2019ll pay $16 for a Netflix account and $6 for a Hulu subscription. A $13 click for Amazon Prime here and a $15 one there for HBO Go. But those prices you might not think twice about in the moment can end up leaving you with a $600 tab on video alone by year\u2019s end. It did for me.\n\nOf course, as the gym membership key tag I carried around for years could attest to, paying for services without actually using them is hardly something new. Subscriptions have always been bought aspirationally. What\u2019s new\u2014thanks to the proliferation of monthly subscriptions combined with a new cutting-the-cord ethos\u2014is the amount of mental gymnastics we have to do when deciding whether or not to keep paying for them over time.\n\nThe obvious answer is subscription hopping. At its core, canceling and resubscribing later seems like a no-brainer. After all, why pay for something that you aren\u2019t using? You wouldn\u2019t shell out for an unlimited subway card if you were only in town for a weekend.\n\nBut in practice, there\u2019s something a lot harder about the decision to reup a subscription service for video. It\u2019s often less about what you do use and more about what you could use. Maybe there\u2019s going to be a new show you might like, and you just don\u2019t know about it yet. Or maybe you really will get around to watching that show you haven\u2019t had any interest in so far.\n\nOut of the conversation\n\nThere\u2019s also a social component. Do you want to be the only one of your friends who didn\u2019t watch \u201cSuccession\u201d because you decided HBO wasn\u2019t worth it? Do you want to go to work and have everybody talking about the latest season of \u201cMindhunter,\u201d but you can\u2019t join in because you got rid of your Netflix subscription?\n\nSo, when I contemplated canceling my HBO Go subscription a few months back, it was harder than I expected. Though the shows I was interested in had wrapped up, it wasn\u2019t difficult to imagine a scenario where I might regret that choice. What then? For the price of a single movie ticket, wouldn\u2019t it be better not to feel that regret, and to give myself the option of watching a hundred movies? Besides, did I really want to have to be vigilant about when my subscription renewed so I didn\u2019t miss my cancellation window?\n\nSo it was time to do the math. Both Netflix and Amazon Prime (through which I get HBO) offer ways to see a list of the shows watched on an account. When I added it all up, I was paying about three times more for each hour of time watching HBO as compared with Netflix, a premium I was choosing for those \u201cjust in case\u201d moments. I canceled later that afternoon, figuring I\u2019d resubscribe when the slate of fall shows started.\n\nI figure I can cut my video-subscription bills in half. Each individual subscription may not mean much. But add them up and you\u2019re talking real money.\n\nOther people I know take a more ruthless approach. A friend of mine, who is what I\u2019d consider a superuser, takes it a step further, waiting for a critical mass of content to hit any given streaming service before signing back up.\n\nFor services with week-by-week offerings, she\u2019ll wait to subscribe until the month of the finale and then binge-watch the whole season. When dealing with streaming platforms that upload full seasons at once, she waits until there\u2019s enough to keep her occupied for a full month before re-engaging and watching what she wants. She times it all to get the most bang for her buck.\n\nOf course, her version has certain disadvantages. She\u2019ll sometimes miss that moment when a specific show or movie is the hot topic online. She will occasionally hear spoilers from friends eager to talk about a twist ending. Still, when she rattled off all the shows she has seen this year, it was clear that she had seen significantly more than I had at a fraction of the cost.\n\nA video diet\n\nThere\u2019s one other advantage to cutting all these all-you-can-eat offerings: You eat a lot less. It\u2019s simple economics: If the price of each individual show goes down, then you consume more of it. That may be a good thing if you\u2019re talking about a gym membership. But maybe it isn\u2019t so good when you\u2019re talking about sitting on your couch watching movies and TV shows.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Which subscriptions have you ended or considered ending due to lack of use? Join the conversation below.\n\nI admit I didn\u2019t start with the intention of cutting back time viewed, just money spent. But there\u2019s no question I ended up reading and exploring the city more.\n\nNone of these calculations are necessarily easy. But they are inevitable in the a la carte world we live in. In the past, longer contracts and bundled services gave consumers a binary option: Either you bit the bullet and paid or you skipped having something altogether.\n\nNow, we have more freedom to make decisions about each element of what we subscribe to, but there\u2019s still a binary component. We can choose to let subscriptions stay on autopilot or dive head first into a subscription-hopping strategy. Though the latter may cost more time and energy, it will likely cost less money.\n\nAnd after all, that money saved can be used to try out whatever the hot subscription startup is next month.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nThe monthly subscription price for the author\u2019s Netflix account is $16. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the price was $15.\n\nMr. McAllister is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.
