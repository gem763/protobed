St. Louis overcame 6-0 deficit in decisive Game 5 at Washington, rallying from two runs down with four in ninth inning to win 9-7.

Washington is first team in more than a century to fall 12 games below .500 and finish with 93 wins or more. ... There were plenty of early calls for manager Dave Martinez to be dismissed, but GM Mike Rizzo never wavered in his public support of the skipper.

Nationals rallied late on big hit by Soto to win wild-card game against Milwaukee and did it again in Game 5 of NLDS at Dodger Stadium. Rendon and Soto homered on consecutive pitches from three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw to tie score in eighth inning, then Kendrick hit grand slam in 10th for 7-3 victory. So in first season since star slugger Bryce Harper left as a free agent, Washington became first team in major league history to come back from three or more runs down twice in elimination games during same postseason. ... Success is built mainly on strong starting rotation, which is among the best in majors, led by Scherzer, Strasburg and Corbin. Those three all ranked in top 10 in NL in ERA, strikeouts and opponents' batting average. ... This is Nationals' first playoff appearance as a wild-card team. Trying to become only third wild card to reach World Series since MLB went to 10-team playoff format in 2012. ... Martinez won his postseason debut as a manager in wild-card game against Milwaukee.

Both teams are getting powerful production from the dangerous sluggers in the middle of their lineups. Rendon, an NL MVP contender, led league in RBIs and ranked second in OPS during regular season. He's kept it going in playoffs, hitting .412 (7 for 17) with a homer and 5 RBIs during NLDS. Behind him, 20-year-old Soto has .930 OPS with 2 homers and 6 RBIs in his first postseason. On the other side, Goldschmidt and Ozuna both batted .429 (9 for 21) in NLDS. They each hit a pair of homers and combined for 7 RBIs.\n\n- Mad Max. Scherzer gave up two early homers to Milwaukee in wild-card game, allowing three runs and four hits in five innings. But the Nationals came back to win after his teams lost his previous seven postseason games - four with Washington and three with Detroit. The three-time Cy Young Award winner, slowed by a back injury this season, helped out of bullpen during NLDS and then threw seven-inning gem to win Game 4 against Dodgers with Washington facing elimination. He is 5-5 with 3.60 ERA in 19 postseason games, 15 starts.\n\n- Injury Updates. Suzuki left Game 5 of NLDS when he was hit in left hand and then helmet by a pitch. X-rays were negative and he's expected to play in NLCS opener as long as he's cleared in concussion protocol. Robles ranked fourth in majors with 12 outfield assists. But he has mild right hamstring strain that sidelined him during NLDS and his status for this series was unclear. Cardinals right-hander Michael Wacha missed NLDS and is expected to be left off roster for this series as well while recovering from strained shoulder.\n\n---\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports", "description": "A look at the best-of-seven National League Championship Series between the Washington Nationals and St. Louis Cardinals:", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/m4PVyyVxE3Oebtg4UaXA_w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/n3SHvNtNK9E_qN.pWxR7RQ--~B/aD0zMDk2O3c9NDY0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/Sports/ap/201910091836669862213", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
