The shadows of discomfort about my body and the ever-present concern that I am not enough faded away, allowing rays of what I believed to be happiness to filter in.\n\nAlcohol allowed me to ignore what I wanted to ignore and avoid what I wanted to avoid, and that was the first lie alcohol told me: that drinking made me happy.\n\nWith wine, vodka or whatever I happened to have in my hand, parenting children on the autism spectrum seemed less stressful \u2014 manageable, even. When I was drinking, my fears about my children and my ability to parent them lessened. Life\u2019s burdens lifted. I felt at ease in social situations.\n\nModern Mommy Madness\n\nThat was the second lie alcohol told me: that I needed it in order to make it through the day.\n\nI started a blog, which led me to start writing for parenting websites. Eventually, this work brought in speaking engagements, publishing opportunities and a way to make money. Women in my age bracket who were struggling with motherhood, marriage and/or other aspects of life in general responded to my content because I was relatable. I mean, who doesn\u2019t need a glass of something in order to make it through dinner, baths and bedtime? RIGHT?\n\nThe more I talked about drinking, the more acceptable it seemed. If no one was judging me, then I wouldn\u2019t judge myself. I was home alone with three kids and multiple animals six days out of the week. I deserved to drink.\n\nThe third lie alcohol told me was that I wasn\u2019t hurting anyone with my drinking.\n\nPlenty of people are capable of drinking in moderation. I\u2019m just not one of them; I like the effect too much to stop once I\u2019ve begun.\n\nI heard a saying recently: \u201cOne is too many and a thousand is never enough.\u201d That is what it\u2019s like to struggle with addiction.\n\nModern Mommy Madness\n\n\u201cMommy wine culture\u201d didn\u2019t cause my alcoholism, it just made it easier to hide. I created content that absolutely contributed to the belief that motherhood and drinking should go hand in hand, and therefore I felt that the best way for me to get \u2014 and stay \u2014 sober was to be completely open and honest about it.\n\nThe fourth lie alcohol told me was that I am worthless without it.\n\nIn recovery, I\u2019ve gained the perspective to see that my addiction to alcohol prevented me from experiencing a life brimming over with genuine happiness and contentment. Alcohol did not make me a better parent. It made me careless, reckless, a danger on the road, a thrower of remote controls and shoes \u2014 among other things \u2014and a screaming lunatic. By the end of it all, I was very, very depressed.\n\nThe interesting thing about sobriety is that the issues I was trying to escape through drinking seemed to disappear or resolve themselves once I began making the effort to heal. The problem was me!\n\nThe healthier I became, the happier and more relaxed my children were. In fact, I just look at my kids on days when I really don\u2019t feel like putting in the work that it takes for me to stay sober. They\u2019re a living, breathing reminder of why the work is worth it. At the end of the day, I\u2019m beginning to find that I am worth it as well.", "description": "Harmony Hobbs is a mom blogger who ditched", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/Harmony-Hobbs-1-ABC-AR-190909_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
