Week 2 of Love Island Australia for 2019, which means a fresh Love Island recap every goddamn day this week. Love Island recaps until I die, probably.\n\nI didn\u2019t recap Friday\u2019s episode because, frankly, I don\u2019t work on Saturday! But nothing important happened. This show is like Days Of Our Lives, you can literally just jump in at any point and figure shit out. It was just like blah blah Eoghan likes Jessie blah blah Matt and Vanessa are a car crash.\n\nWhich is pretty much what happens this episode too. Let\u2019s get into it, yeah?\n\nSo we start with Eoghan and Jessie having a chat \u2013 he\u2019s telling her he\u2019s finally decided his decision to couple up with her was a good one. Have I told you how much I hate this guy? I fucking hate this guy \u2013 everything he says sounds like \u201cI am so sought after, you should be so lucky to have me Jessie\u201d. When actually he\u2019s just like a soft 5/10 as an overall package with temporary sexy long hair and a beard.\n\nJessie is thrilled to be selected as someone Eoghan deigns to spend time with, though.\n\nThe dude legit says \u201chopefully we can keep it going\u201d. I just cannoooooooootttttttttt can you please all agree that Eoghan sucks a bag of dicks and a half? I\u2019m not insane in this am I? He\u2019s a tool?? Yes?? Yes.\n\nMeanwhile Cartier has forcefully convinced herself she\u2019s into Adam, which is a joke and a half. She talks a LOT about being turned on for someone who is like extremely born-again Christian, maybe she\u2019s one of the ones who chooses to ignore that bit in the Bible where you\u2019re not allowed to have sex before marriage. Or maybe she is going to perform a marriage ceremony on Adam while he\u2019s asleep and then be like \u201csurpriseeeeee hubby!\u201d\n\nShe also tells Adam she\u2019s punching which like????? What???? I\u2019m not saying Adam is a hideous monster but surely we can all agree Cartier is at least on par with this guy. They have the most awkward fucking we\u2019re-gonna-kiss-but-no-one-is-doing-anything period, fuuuck I hate watching people prepare to kiss, it is the most uncomfortable content in the history of content. Eventually, they do \u2013 a very chaste peck.\n\nIt\u2019s a *bit* cute \u2013 Adam tells the camera he wants to take it slow until they\u2019re coupled up. I still can\u2019t buy these two but maybe they can convince me eventually.\n\nEveryone goes to sleep, and in the morning the girls find \u201cLove Island Times\u201d, this primary school project of a newspaper that has a story about Maurice and his ex-girlfriend \u2013 it says they were together just 2 weeks before he entered the villa.\n\nCynthia is understandably thrown since she\u2019s tepidly interested in Maurice, so she goes to wake him up so they can have a chat. He literally fixes his hair (!!!!) before he ventures outside. Incredible.\n\nWhen he sees the newspaper he lets out this proper evil maniac laugh that lasts for way too long, then denies it all \u2013 he says the girl in question was just someone he was dating, which is fundamentally untrue because her Instagram is full of photos of them together looking mucho coupley, but you know \u2013 Cynthia can\u2019t see that. She\u2019s still suss, though.\n\nSam meanwhile is still banging on about wanting to couple up with Vanessa. He decides to grab Matt for a chat. Matt is sitting with Jessie and Cassie, seemingly watching Eoghan pull some elastic to show off his arm muscles.\n\nMatt takes an Alpha Male stance:\n\nI don\u2019t even know why he bothered to talk to Matt, Sam literally asks him how he and Vanessa are going, and Matt\u2019s like \u201cgood?\u201d \u2013 I mean what did you expect him to say, Sam.\n\nSam goes off to chat to Vanessa and Eoghan takes his place, also flexing. They start some inane convo about being the Big Dogs and \u201cpissing all over the yard\u201d \u2013 what. Fuck me, I need some major dudes to walk in so these fuckwits can be put in their place.\n\nThen they start bro-ing into eternity.\n\nThen, because these men are neanderthals, they start fake punching on???\n\nI actually love wrestling and this would be funny and endearing to me, if they weren\u2019t the most repulsive human beings in Australia who were clearly doing it to piss all over the lawn as the Big Dogs.\n\nBlah blah, Adam tells Cassie he\u2019s taking it slow with Cartier, Phoebe tells the entire villa she\u2019s into Cassie. Then it\u2019s time for a game \u2013 based on some survey everyone did before coming onto the show, each islander has to choose which person they\u2019re statistically most compatible with, and the least compatible with. Then they arrange everyone else in order.\n\nOf course it gets tense \u2013 Vanessa selects Eoghan as her most compatible, naturally Matt cracks the internal shits and looks like his Nan died, so she then gives him the Heart-Eyes emoji instead.\n\nIn the end SAM is her most compatible, and she is loving this spicy turn of events.\n\nThe only other interesting shit that happens is that Anna\u2019s perfect match is Matt, and Jessie tells the camera that everyone feels they should be together but no one is game to sideswipe Vanessa.\n\nThen it\u2019s business as usual, everyone sitting around ignoring sun safety by dipping themselves in a vat of oil and sitting in the sun.\n\nEoghan, because he\u2019s like a heaps good boyfriend, tricks Jessie with words that aren\u2019t French. She legit believes \u201cbanana\u201d and \u201carigato\u201d are french words which is alarming.\n\nMeanwhile Sam pulls Vanessa aside for a chat, telling the camera he doesn\u2019t care about the repercussions but also looking like he might do a little stress vom.\n\nThe chat is basically Vanessa saying she thinks Sam and her would work but she also thinks Matt is cool, and Sam being like \u201cyeah fully, it sucks\u201d. Also Vanessa is really going HAM with the Tradie undies spon. What the fuck is this cyclist outfit:\n\nCynthia is saying she feels something there with Maurice now, but the look in her eyes says \u201csave me\u201d:\n\nThen it\u2019s time for everyone to get ready for the recoupling ceremony. Adam first must spray himself in the eyeball with hair product.\n\nSophie shows up and everyone starts picking their person. Anna chooses Gerard, Phoebe chooses Cassie, Jessie chooses Eoghan, Vanessa chooses Matt, Cartier picks Adam and that leaves Cynthia Our Queen to choose between Maurice and Sam.\n\nShe has this long panic over who to pick, while Maurice stares daggers / sends mental brainwaves to wipe her brain so she chooses him.\n\nShe goes with ~her heart~ (aka her brainwashed mind) and chooses Maurice. BYE SAM.\n\nSide Note: I have a podcast and you should listen bc I\u2019m just as batshit on there as I am in this Love Island recap \u2013 All Aussie Mystery Hour, get on it.", "description": "It's time for another Love Island recap for episode 6, and the drama is escalating as Vanessa chooses between Matt and Sam.", "authors": ["Melissa Mason"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-15-at-10.58.25-am-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
