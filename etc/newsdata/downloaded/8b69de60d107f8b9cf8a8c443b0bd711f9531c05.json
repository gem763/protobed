The past decade has seen the science-fiction world change as more international voices enthusiastically jumped into the fray. Now, wonderful writers including Malaysian Zen Cho can write smart, funny fantasies such as \u201cSorcerer to the Crown\u201d; after years of struggle, Nigerian Tade Thompson\u2019s ambitious Africa-set novel, \u201cRosewater,\u201d was published to wide acclaim and recently won the prestigious Arthur C. Clarke Award; and Chinese author Liu Cixin\u2019s \u201cThe Three-Body Problem,\u201d translated by Ken Liu, has become a bestseller and even has a recommendation from former president Barack Obama.\n\nIn our new column, we hope to highlight some of the fresh, exciting, weird and wacky science fiction and fantasy from around the world and also look back at some underappreciated gems from the past.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, what books did we get excited about recently?\n\nLavie: \u201cLion City,\u201d by Ng Yi-Sheng. It\u2019s published by a Singaporean press, Epigram, but available in e-book. It\u2019s a short-story collection of decidedly fantastical, and decidedly Singaporean, tales. It very much skews to the literary side \u2014 think Aimee Bender (who incidentally wrote what I think is a great zombie story, \u201cAmong Us\u201d) or Etgar Keret and you\u2019ll come close. My favorite story here might be \u201cNo Man Is,\u201d about a boy who goes into the sea one day and decides to become an island. What happens next are increasingly fantastical and funny adventures.\n\nAlso, I just have to give a shout-out to Kuzhali Manickavel, a wonderful Indian writer of short fiction in English. Her two collections, \u201cInsects Are Just Like You and Me Except Some of Them Have Wings\u201d and \u201cThings We Found During the Autopsy\u201d should be on everyone\u2019s shelf. I mean, just look at those titles!\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSilvia: I\u2019m starting to read \u201cWhy, Why, Why?\u201d by Spanish author Quim Monz\u00f3, who mostly writes in Catalan, and oddly enough, although I didn\u2019t know about \u201cLion City,\u201d it sounds like something in a similar vibe (literary, speculative, with the variety of a box of chocolates), so I\u2019ll have to pick it up and let you know if I\u2019m right.\n\nMy recommendation is \u201cTears of the Trufflepig,\u201d by Fernando A. Flores, a near-future, dystopian novel. It\u2019s the kind of book that gets labeled as surrealist by literary readers who have never read science fiction and that is, at the same time, in danger of never being found by genre readers because it doesn\u2019t come from a genre imprint.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely genre, though, because the world here is a future in which narcos are cloning extinct species, such as dodos, and there\u2019s not one, but three walls between Mexico and the United States. But it\u2019s also a hard-boiled novel: Drugs are legal, so business centers on selling illegal \u201cfiltered\u201d animals or shrunken human heads. It feels a bit like the classics of the novela negra of Latin America \u2014 think Paco Ignacio Taibo II or Rafael Bernal \u2014 were fused with a Philip K. Dick book. It\u2019s darkly funny at times, to boot.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLavie: Shrunken heads? Dodos? I\u2019m sold! Also, I love Taibo ever since I found his \u201cReturn to the Same City\u201d in a secondhand book shop in Laos years ago. He\u2019d killed his detective in the previous novel, but then decided to just bring him back from the dead, full of bullet holes and all!\n\nSilvia: Yup, Taibo was a favorite of mine growing up. In \u201cTears of the Trufflepig,\u201d Flores really captures the essence of living at the border. He\u2019s a Mexican-born writer who lives in Texas. I think he inhabits the liminal space many of the writers we\u2019ve mentioned are writing in. This is a nascent, evolving, truly global kind of science fiction \u2014 and it\u2019s exciting to wonder what we\u2019ll find next.\n\nSilvia Moreno-Garcia is the author of the novels \u201cGods of Jade and Shadow\u201d and \u201cSignal to Noise.\u201d Lavie Tidhar is the author of several novels, including \u201cThe Violent Century,\u201d \u201cA Man Lies Dreaming,\u201d \u201cCentral Station\u201d and \u201cUnholy Land.\u201d\n\nSCIENCE FICTION and FANTASY\n\nAD", "description": "Our new columnists highlight the works of NYi-Sheng, Fernando A.
