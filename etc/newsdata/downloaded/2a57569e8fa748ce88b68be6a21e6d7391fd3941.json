The Sea Life London Aquarium is bringing gender neutrality out into the open using the animal kingdom.\n\nA 4-month-old penguin chick in the London aquarium is being used for a political agenda, which is something I never foresaw writing about. The story caught my attention because I\u2019m particularly fond of penguins. A sentimental gesture sparked my interest in the creatures more than 30 years ago. Now a story about two gay penguins raising a chick presents an excuse for the Sea Life London Aquarium to declare the chick as genderless. It is a first for the aquarium to do this. The young penguin is also still nameless but I hope the aquarium will correct that in the near future.\n\n\u201cWhile the decision may ruffle a few feathers, gender neutrality in humans has only recently become a widespread topic of conversation,\u201d Graham McGrath, the aquarium\u2019s general manager, said in a statement. \u201cHowever, it is completely natural for penguins to develop genderless identities as they grow into mature adults.\u201d\n\nOk, if it is \u201ccompletely natural for penguins to develop genderless identities\u201d why is the aquarium doing this? Just for publicity? Maybe. Mostly, though, it looks like it is to conflate penguin characteristics with those of human beings. Penguins do possess some admirable human-like qualities \u2013 they are monogamous and mate for life, the male penguins play a big role in nurturing chicks, and, like me, they are partial to ice-free areas.\n\nThe adopted chick of Rocky and Marama won\u2019t be given a gendered name and identification band like the other penguins. This one will be identified with a purple band. I see potential medical bills for psychiatric therapy sessions in this little one\u2019s future. After all, it is being labeled as different from all the other penguins- that \u2018s got to mess with its psyche in the future, right? Isn\u2019t it politically incorrect to label others as different? See, we can take this nonsense as far as anyone wants.\n\nThis little chick was chosen because of the gay penguins raising it.\n\nAs for why this particular chick was chosen to be the aquarium\u2019s first \u201cgenderless\u201d one, Sea Life noted that this chick \u201ccaptured the Aquarist team and guest\u2019s imaginations after it was successfully adopted by two female penguins.\u201d \u201cThis was the first time we had successfully adopted a chick onto a same-sex couple and to mark the parenting achievements of Rocky and Marama in helping to develop the chick into a happy and healthy penguin,\u201d Sea Life wrote in a statement. \u201cIt made sense to continue to allow it to be identified more naturally by staff and guests at the aquarium in the future.\u201d\n\nYes, in order to play up the fact that the chick was adopted by two female penguins, the aquarium is calling it genderless, at least for the time being. Aren\u2019t these people supposed to be a part of the scientific community? How do they deny the sexual development of an animal just to make a splash (no pun intended) in the culture wars?\n\nThe gender-is-fluid crowd is now expanding into the animal kingdom. I\u2019ll give some credit to the Sydney Sea Life Aquarium. When two Gentoo penguins adopted a chick last October, they treated that event as normal business. That chick wasn\u2019t made a test experiment for the cultural warriors among us.\n\nWe live in really stupid times. Gay animals exist in nature. A few animals can switch gender. Let the little penguin grow as was intended.", "description": "You will be made to care.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/34fcc772-bc28-49da-8667-7a65a6d125cb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
