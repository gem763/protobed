I think I float somewhere in between,\u201d they said in an interview with Jamila Jamil on Instagram. At the time, Smith said they would continue to use he and his pronouns. On Friday, Smith announced via Instagram post that their pronouns are the gender neutral they and them.\n\n\u201cAfter a lifetime of being at war with my gender I\u2019ve decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cI\u2019m so excited and privileged to be surrounded by people that support me in this decision but I\u2019ve been very nervous about announcing this because I care too much about what people think but fuck it!\u201d They also noted they expect \u201cmany mistakes and mis gendering,\u201d but are asking for people to try their best. Smith also tagged a number of \u201cactivists and leaders of the non binary/trans community\u201d who they thanked for helping them along their journey. The list included trans, genderqueer artist and soon-to-be Supergirl cast member Chella Man and Queer Eye\u2019s Jonathan Van Ness.\n\nA friendly reminder, pronouns are not a preference. They just are. Also, if you\u2019re thinking but they and them are grammatically incorrect when referring to singular person \u2026 kindly stop. There are plenty of situations where you use \u201cthey\u201d to refer to one person, like, as per this helpful Reddit thread, if a person walks away from a group conversation and you say, \u201coh, I like them!\u201d Also this isn\u2019t about grammar. It\u2019s about respect.", "description": "Singer Sam Smith came out as nonbinary earlier this year. They announced on Instagram they should be addressed with they and them pronouns.
