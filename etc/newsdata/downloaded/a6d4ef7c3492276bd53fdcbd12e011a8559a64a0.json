It's deep learning at its best.\"\n\nThrough the Memory Project, Frost's art club students were connected with young boys and girls attending school at refugee camps in Afghanistan.\n\nUsing their photographs as a reference, the St. Patrick's students carefully sketched portraits of the children in Afghanistan. They then shipped the portraits overseas.\n\nSt. Patrick's High School creative arts director Mirella Frost, third from left, stands with the students who sketched portraits of children attending school in refugee camps in Afghanistan.

It was, like, a way to connect with children across the world who are suffering.\"\n\nNathan O'Hare sketched a portrait of a young girl wearing a hijab decorated with jewels and flowers.\n\nO'Hare said what he found most fascinating about the project was how his art could bring joy to someone from a completely different background, living on the opposite side of the world.\n\n\"They know nothing about me other than, like, what I sent in return,\" he said. \"I think that's probably the craziest part for me.\"\n\nStudents in Ottawa sketch portraits of kids in refugee camps in Syria and Afghanistan. 6:20\n\n'So proud'\n\nIn all, 10 of the art club students took part in the Memory Project initiative this year, said Frost, who learned about it through a niece attending school in Florida.\n\nIt's not the first time she's organized this initiative: two years ago, her students sketched students living in difficult conditions in Syria.\n\n\"I want them to connect to students across the globe, to these children who [are often] suffering,\" Frost said.\n\n\"It makes me so proud that they wanted to participate in this. It's just an extremely rewarding project.\"", "description": "Mirella Frost wanted her students at Ottawa's St. Patrick's High School to become global citizens.
