A rope made from bedsheets and used in an attempt to escape the fire still hung from an upper floor window of the hospital Friday.\n\nMost victims died of asphyxiation as smoke filled the wards, and some died when life support equipment stopped working in the fire, said Gabriela Gra\u00e7a, director of the state Institute of Forensic Medicine.\n\nCarlos Outerelo was visiting his sick mother when the fire started Thursday night. The 90-year-old woman, Berta Gon\u00e7alves Berreiros Sousa, was among the dead.\n\n\u201cThey said to stay closed off in the rooms so the smoke couldn\u2019t get in, and that it was under control. But in reality, it wasn\u2019t under control,\u201d Outerelo said outside the morgue where his mother\u2019s body was taken.\n\n\u201cThe smoke started coming from the air conditioning ducts and it turned black and became hard to see,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was horrible.\u201d\n\nDaniel Freitas de Brito said his 83-year-old mother, Irene Freitas, also died in the fire. \u201cI lost my mom, which is awful,\u201d de Brito said at the morgue. \u201cIt*s tragic. ... I wish she had had a natural death, not to die in this way.\u201d\n\nWhen firefighters arrived, they evacuated people but it was more difficult to move patients who were hooked up to medical equipment, according to reports.\n\nCamila Donato, a police spokeswoman, said police were cleared by firefighters to enter the hospital Friday morning and had begun investigating the case.\n\nAs the fire burned, medical workers in surgical masks rolled equipment in the road as smoke billowed from the building. Television images showed staff tending to patients sitting in wheelchairs with IV poles beside them in the street, some on sheets and mattresses.\n\nA woman carried an oxygen tank. One patient was moved into the street in a regular hospital bed. Intensive care patients were among those rescued.\n\nIn the chaos, distraught relatives tried to track down patients, unsure of whether they had perished in the fire or had been transferred to another medical facility.\n\nAuthorities released a list of names of 10 of the dead, some in their 80s and 90s.\n\nMarcelo Crivella, the mayor of Rio de Janeiro, said a total of 11 people died. He declared an official mourning period of three days.\n\nA social worker and other Badim Hospital staff are assisting relatives of patients, the hospital said Friday.\n\nThe hospital is in a middle-income neighborhood and a short walk from Maracana stadium, which was used for World Cup soccer matches, the 2016 Rio Olympics and also Copa America soccer fixtures this year.\n\nBadim Hospital is part of a chain of private hospitals in Brazil operated by the D*Or S\u00e3o Luiz network. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is currently in the care of the same group at another of its hospitals in Sao Paulo, where he is recovering from a surgery related to a stabbing last year.\n\nThe website of the Badim Hospital says its 2018 renovation includes \u201cstate-of-the-art infrastructure\u201d and is geared to provide \u201cluxury\u201d treatment. The hospital \u201caims to guarantee the comfort and hospitality necessary in this delicate moment of the patient\u2019s life,\u201d the website says.", "description": "Staff were forced to wheel patients into the streets on stretchers after a fire broke out at Badim Hospital in Rio de Janeiro.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7cdaa423000058055384bc.jpeg?cache=pquhq1lulc&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
