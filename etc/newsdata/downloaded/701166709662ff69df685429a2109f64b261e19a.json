But de Blasio\u2019s public dalliance with the two ideas will do little to restore faith among safe streets advocates that he has truly recommitted to driving down street fatalities, or that he understands why they argue for more protected bike lanes unobstructed by trucks or cops.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nRather, his comments are likely to reinforce the notion that beneath his Vision Zero veneer, the mayor is a \u201ccar guy\u201d at heart.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he is,\u201d said Jon Orcutt, the spokesperson for Bike New York. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a point of view of the city from the sidewalk or the subway or the bike lane. He\u2019s got a point of view of it from his car. He just doesn\u2019t get this stuff.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s history on the topic is rife with comments that Orcutt and his ilk, who comprise an increasingly powerful interest group, view as rhetorical missteps that undermine his stated policy goals.\n\nAs public advocate in 2012, he called New York City\u2019s sharp-elbowed former transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, a \u201cradical\u201d for her bike lane expansion program, and described himself as more of a bike lane \u201cincrementalist.\u201d He has since adopted, on paper, her approach to street redesign.\n\nAs mayor in 2015 he considered tearing up the Times Square pedestrian plazas beloved by urbanists the world over, only to back down under intense criticism. In 2018, he said he was open to ticketing pedestrians for walking while texting. That also came to naught.\n\nOn Wednesday, a reporter asked de Blasio if he was open to requiring helmets for users of New York City\u2019s bikeshare program, Citi Bike.\n\n\u201cI have thought about that, and that\u2019s something we\u2019re talking about inside the administration,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are different viewpoints on what would work and how much impact it would have. But I think it\u2019s a real valid issue so it\u2019s something we\u2019re studying right now.\u201d\n\nWhen POLITICO asked for more details about those ongoing discussions, a spokesperson for the mayor referred back to his public comments.\n\nAn administration official who would normally be privy to those sorts of talks expressed surprise at the mayor\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any conversations of this kind that have been going on,\u201d the official said, requesting anonymity.\n\nDuring the same press conference, another reporter asked de Blasio about requiring bikes be registered with the city, since the motor vehicles they share the road with are licensed.\n\nHe said he hadn't given the idea any thought, but that it was a \"valid discussion.\"\n\n\"First and foremost it's about enforcement of the motor vehicles, where we still have the central problem,\" de Blasio said. \"We are going to keep expanding enforcement on bicycles as well, because we still have a lot of bike riders who have to remember they have to follow the rules. But in terms of other things we should do, we don't have a final plan for that now, but I think all of these proposals are fair and we should look at them.\"\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s comments unnerved safe streets advocates, who argue that he threatens to undermine his own cycling and safe streets programs, including his efforts to expand Citi Bike, cut cyclist deaths through the expansion of bike lanes, and fully eliminate traffic deaths through Vision Zero.\n\nHelmet requirements have been blamed for low bike share usage in other cities and experts believe streets are safer for cyclists when there are more cyclists on streets.\n\nRequiring Citi Bike riders wear helmets \u201cwould throw an atom bomb into the positive trajectory we\u2019re seeing around Citi Bike ridership,\u201d said Orcutt.\n\nJulie Wood, a spokesperson for Citi Bike, echoed the sentiment, as did Nicole Gelinas, a transportation expert with the right-leaning Manhattan Institute.\n\n\u201cThe helmet comments are demoralizing because it shows how hard it is to make policy progress in this city even when things are supposedly going well,\u201d Gelinas said. \u201cWe need a complete redesign of the streets ... Instead, we\u2019re having what seems like a sort of retro, 1990s-style debate with someone\u2019s well-meaning but clueless relative who knows nothing about the topic of helmets.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s comments about bike registration got a similar reception, particularly given the context. As of September 4, 20 cyclists have died on city streets, compared to 10 in all of 2018, according to Marco Conner, deputy director of Transportation Alternatives. This year, cyclists have killed two pedestrians, by Conner's count. On average, they kill fewer than one person a year. De Blasio's comments came following a recent New York Post story about the dangers that some cyclists pose to pedestrians.\n\n\u201cJust because we require licenses and training to operate a multi-ton lethal vehicle in the form of a car or truck, doesn't mean we should automatically do the same with bicycles, which do not pose the same danger even remotely,\u201d Conner said. \u201cAnd on top of that, we\u2019ve seen from the NYPD that they are not capable of enforcing bicycling laws in a racially neutral manner.\"\n\nCouncil Speaker Corey Johnson, who's assiduously courted the safe-streets vote for his likely mayoral bid, was none too impressed, either.\n\n\"I am all about safety, but we need to be encouraging cycling, not creating obstacles,\" he tweeted. \"These ideas won\u2019t help us increase bike riding in NYC.\"", "description": "Bill de Blasio's comments are likely to reinforce the notion that beneath his Vision Zero veneer, the mayor is a \u201ccar guy\u201d at heart.", "authors": ["Dana Rubinstein", "Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9a/4f/b554949146f796ac6409714df845/bill-de-blasio-4.png"}
