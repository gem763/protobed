GR Auto Gallery is excited to offer this powerful Hennessey Performance-equipped 2015 Ford Mustang GT installed with plenty of upgraded go-fast goodies. This is definitely not your average run-of-the-mill Mustang GT as this particular example was transported to Sealy, Texas, and spent some time at the well-known Hennessey Performance shop.\n\nPack A Potent Punch In This 2015 Ford Mustang GT Hennessey More\n\nAlready equipped with a powerful 5.0-liter Coyote V8 under the hood off the assembly line, Hennessey upped the ante even more and topped it with a 2.9-liter Hennessey supercharger. While the blower is a huge upgrade in itself, Hennessey installed an extensive list of upgrades to this Mustang. Other performance modifications include upgraded fuel injectors, upgraded fuel pump system, braided hoses, a carbon fiber high-flow air induction setup, and carbon fiber coilpack covers. The car also sits on a lowered suspension for improved handling. With the help of Hennessey, this pony delivers an impressive 604-horsepower\n\nFinished in Magnetic Metallic Gray, this Mustang's exterior was given a few upgrades for aerodynamics as well. Protecting the engine bay is a carbon fiber hood by Anderson Composites, and it also features an adjustable front splitter and rear spoiler. Unique Hennessey badges were strategically placed on the outside, so those who may recognize the name know that this pony isn't playing around. The roof was wrapped in vinyl and proudly features a grayscale American flag, an accent that helps the exterior seriously pop.\n\nInside the car is an ebony interior complete with Recaro sport seats up front. The rear seats were removed to make room for the 6-point roll cage found inside the car, and for even more safety, a fire extinguisher can be found inside as well. While the rear seats are not inside the car thanks to the roll cage, they do come with the purchase of the car.\n\nFrom the factory, the Mustang comes with infotainment and navigation, rear-park assist, and a set of 20-inch wheels wrapped with Toyo rubber. To bring everything easily to a stop is the addition of 15-inch Brembo brakes. Where the push-start button is has been switched with a \"Go Baby Go\" button, a familiar phrase found in the remake of Gone in 60 Seconds in regards to the '67 Mustang fastback widely known as Eleanor.\n\nIf this performance-oriented S550 Mustang would make the perfect addition to your garage, then contact GR Auto Gallery today. The car is listed at $39,900, but feel free to make an offer here.\n\nRead More...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "This Hennessey Performance-equipped pony is a supercharged beast with 604-horsepower on tap.When Hennessey Performance is is attached to the name, you know it means business.
