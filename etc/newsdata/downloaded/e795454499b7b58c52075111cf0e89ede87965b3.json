The hacker's download link is for a 2.25GB ZIP file that holds a 4.06GB CSV file containing the user records of 24,386,039 LuminPDF users.\n\nWith the help of a source, ZDNet has obtained a copy of this archive and verified its authenticity with several Lumin PDF users.\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\nFor the vast majority of user records, the CSV file contains users' full names, email addresses, gender, (language) locale settings, and a hashed password string or Google access token.\n\nFor most user entries, there's a Google access token included in the leaked data, confirming that most Lumin PDF are using the service as an add-in Google Drive app.\n\nHowever, for 118,746 users, the leaked Lumin PDF data contained password strings that appear to have been hashed using the Bcrypt algorithm, suggesting these are users who registered an account on the Lumin PDF website.\n\nHacker claims Lumin PDF ignored contact attempts\n\nWriting on the forum, the hacker claimed to have obtained the data from a MongoDB database belonging to Lumin PDF that was left exposed online without a password back in April 2019.\n\n\"The unprotected database was found about 5 months ago,\" the hacker wrote. \"Vendor was contacted multiple times, but ignored all the queries.\n\n\"The data was later destroyed by ransomware, and server taken down soon after,\" the hacker added.\n\nSuch destructive attacks on MongoDB servers aren't new and have been happening since late 2016. Cybercriminals have made a habit out of accessing unprotected MongoDB databases, deleting their content, and leaving a ransom note behind hoping that a clueless victim would pay a ransom demand for data that doesn't exist anymore.\n\nThe hacker, whose name we won't be sharing in this article, did not make it particularly clear why they were sharing Lumin PDF's user records, despite the Lumin PDF server and the data not being available anymore. At a first glance, this looks like petty revenge.\n\nZDNet reached out to Lumin PDF, but the company did not return a request for comment before this article's publication.\n\nWhat users ca do\n\nIn the meantime, the most dangerous part of this leak is the presence of Google access tokens in the leaked data. These access tokens can allow malicious threat actors to pose as legitimate users and access Google Drive accounts.\n\nZDNet has notified Google of the leaked data and the presence of the leaked access tokens. A Google spokesperson said the company is investigating the incident.\n\nIn the meantime, to prevent any unauthorized access to Google Drive accounts, users who used Lumin PDF are advised to revoke the app's access to their Google Drive account.\n\nInstructions on how to do this are available in this Google Drive support page, and also below:\n\nOn your computer, go to drive.google.com.\n\nClick the cog (settings) icon in the top-right menu bar.\n\nClick the Settings option in the drop-down menu.\n\nClick Manage apps in the side-menu\n\nNext to the app, click Options.\n\nClick Disconnect from Drive.", "description": "The person who leaked the data claims it notified Lumin PDF earlier this year but got no reply.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/16/ee231831-f9d6-49bd-bdcf-5ea6c798a7cc/thumbnail/770x578/0584bb1a94691d58955ba1155700b9e2/luminpdf-users-redacted.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
