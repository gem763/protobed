Bernie Sanders has added his name to the list of lawmakers defending fellow 2020 presidential candidate, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, after 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton made reference to Russians \"grooming\" her.\n\n\"Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country,\" Sanders said in a tweet Monday. \"People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.\"\n\nGabbard has seen an outpouring of support from both sides of the political aisle after Clinton made her remarks on a podcast last week. Though Clinton did not use Gabbard's name, the comments appeared to be directed at the veteran.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and they\u2019re grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\" Clinton said. \"She's the favorite of the Russians.\"\n\nMore: U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard says Hillary Clinton 'knows she can't control me'\n\nGabbard responded to the former secretary of state on Twitter, accusing Clinton of being behind an effort to tarnish her campaign and reputation.\n\n\"You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain,\" Gabbard tweeted.\n\nGabbard brought up her endorsement of Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary, which came after she quit as the vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.\n\n\"They said Clinton will never forget. That she and her rich and powerful friends, her allies in politics and the media will make sure you\u2019re destroyed,\" Gabbard said.\n\nClinton also called President Donald Trump \"Vladimir Putin's dream\" and referred to 2016 Green Party opponent Jill Stein as a \"Russian asset.\" Stein received about 1% of the vote in 2016.\n\nTrump, too, defended Gabbard on Monday. \"She\u2019s accusing everyone of being a Russian agent,\" the president said. \"I don\u2019t know Tulsi, but she\u2019s not a Russian agent.\"\n\nSo now Crooked Hillary is at it again! She is calling Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard \u201ca Russian favorite,\u201d and Jill Stein \u201ca Russian asset.\u201d As you may have heard, I was called a big Russia lover also (actually, I do like Russian people. I like all people!). Hillary\u2019s gone Crazy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2019\n\nSeveral 2020 Democratic candidates, including author Marianne Williamson, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke.\n\n\"Tulsi is not being groomed by anyone. She is her own person,\" O'Rourke said. \"Obviously has served this country, continues to serve this country in uniform, in Congress, as a candidate for presidency so I think those facts speak for themselves.\"\n\nRecognizing their \"very different views,\" South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg said that he doesn't know what the basis is for the accusation against Gabbard.\n\n\"I'd prefer to have the conversation be about policy,\" Buttigieg said of attacks on his opponents, speaking to CNN.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Bernie Sanders slams Hillary Clinton claim Tulsi Gabbard Russian asset", "description": "Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are both among the many lawmakers who have come to Tulsi Gabbard's defense.", "authors": ["Jeanine Santucci", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/D6JC1txojsg_1l7xztNutg--~B/aD0yMjY2O3c9MjA1MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/4714120b7331238f120ee0f533ce012e", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
