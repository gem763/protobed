That date is the first day of China\u2019s three-day \u201cWorld Internet Conference,\u201d to be held this year in the city of Wuzhen, in eastern Zhejiang province.\n\nChina has approximately three times the number of online citizens as the United States, according to a South China Morning Post report, but their experience of the global network is vastly different behind what Wired magazine first called \u201cThe Great Firewall of China\u201d in 1997. CNN calls the communist dictatorship\u2019s ongoing efforts to block unwanted information \u201cthe world\u2019s most sophisticated top-down censorship apparatus.\u201d\n\nRussia has been taking notes. Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s administration has been using a similar strategy for years and continues to aggressively pursue complete control over his people\u2019s access to information not approved by the Kremlin.\n\nIn March, Putin signed two bills into law that level fines against anyone who publishes what the government deems \u201cfake news,\u201d or shows \u201cclear disrespect for society, the state, the official state symbols of the Russian Federation, the Constitution of the Russian Federation, and bodies exercising state power.\u201d\n\nNow the two superpowers are officially joining forces to reinforce their control. This is just the latest example of what Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov characterized as a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the nations sharing a 4,300KM border.", "description": "Russia announced on Tuesday that\u00a0China and Russia will sign a treaty to cooperate in further censoring internet access for their citizens.", "authors": ["Nate Church"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/04/wi/ap/29/3i3gpf-e1493498951188.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
