The Kurds were the top US ally in the fight against ISIL in the region.\n\n191015143157365\n\nThe House measure says Turkey should halt military actions in Syria and says the US should send humanitarian aid to the embattled Kurds.\n\nIt also calls on Trump to produce \"a clear and specific plan for the enduring defeat\" of ISIL.\n\nThe measure comes after Trump imposed sanctions on Turkey over its operation in northeast Syria. Many politicians have said, however, the sanctions are not enough.\n\n\"We have always maintained that, while certainly needed, a sanctions package alone is insufficient for reversing this humanitarian disaster,\" House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement introducing the House resolution.\n\nAn identical bipartisan measure is being introduced in the Senate.\n\nTrump has come under sharp criticism from members of Congress, including from many in his Republican Party, who view the withdrawal as an abandonment of Kurdish forces and fear what it means for the battle against ISIL.\n\n191015062532991\n\nRepublican Leader Mitch McConnell delivered a reminder Tuesday that a veto-proof majority of 70 senators voted earlier this year against such a pullout. He suggested Trump's move allowed Turkey to launch operations in northeast Syria, \"creating a power vacuum begging for the meddling influence of Russia\", and leaving Syria open for Iran to advance its reach \"unimpeded\" towards Israel.\n\nSchumer slammed Trump for scuttling years of progress American and Syrian Kurdish forces had made against ISIL \"in one fell, quick, unthought-out swoop\".", "description": "US House politicians introduce measure opposing Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from northeast Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/14/2ea58d6fbd9d41a7b48731de975e33cc_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
