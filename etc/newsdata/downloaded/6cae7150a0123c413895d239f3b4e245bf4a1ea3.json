(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nHoward quarterback Caylin Newton has likely played his final game for the Bison.\n\nThe younger brother of Carolina Panthers QB Cam Newton still intends to graduate from the university in May, but he said in a statement Tuesday he plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal with two years of eligibility remaining. This will allow other schools to contact and recruit him.\n\n\u201cAfter speaking with my family and some of the greats who have played at this prestigious university, they have all contributed to giving me the clarity and guidance to make the decision I think is best for my future,\u201d Newton wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. \u201c\u2026 Thank you HU for support through my athletic transition. I will always be a Howard Bison.\u201d\n\nNewton\u2019s decision comes after he opted to sit out Saturday\u2019s game against Bethune-Cookman University. Newton qualifies for a redshirt this season because he played only four games.\n\nIn an interview late Tuesday, his father, Cecil Newton Sr., emphasized Caylin\u2019s decision was not predetermined coming into this season, which began with a 79-0 loss to Maryland and now has Howard with a 1-4 record.\n\n\u201cIt does come as a surprise, there were some extenuating circumstances that we considered in this abrupt decision,\u201d Cecil Newton said. \u201cI applaud the Howard experience \u2014 it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to leave next week. We\u2019ll be here until graduation in May; he\u2019s not saying his goodbyes.\u201d\n\nCaylin Newton\u2019s arrival at Howard in 2017 was met with immediate hope that he could pump life into the school\u2019s football program. It didn\u2019t take him long to exceed expectations. In his first game, Newton led the Bison to a 43-40 victory against UNLV after oddsmakers declared them 45-point underdogs.\n\nIn that game, the 6-foot quarterback rushed for 190 yards on 21 carries and accounted for three touchdowns, contributing 330 yards of total offense. It was one of the biggest college football upsets of all time. The Bison finished the season 7-4 after going 3-19 the two seasons prior, and Newton was named Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference rookie of the year.\n\n[Cam Newton\u2019s brother, Caylin, seeks to make a name for himself at Howard]\n\nStatistically, Newton had an impressive career as a Bison. He won MEAC offensive player of the year last season after leading the Football Championship Subdivision in total offense (313.3 yards per game) and average passing yardage (263 per game), but Howard took a step backward, going 4-6.\n\nThe Bison have struggled this season, winning only Newton\u2019s last game, 24-9, over Delaware State on Sept. 21.\n\nCecil Newton said Caylin hasn\u2019t determined where he\u2019ll play next. Caylin will consider a school with a strong master\u2019s program in sports management or marketing, according to his father, as he decides between a couple career paths.\n\nUnlike his older brother Cam, who was the No. 1 pick in the 2011 NFL draft, Caylin isn\u2019t considered a high-level pro prospect.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t play football all his life,\u201d Cecil Newton added. \u201cHe\u2019s got to have something else, too.\u201d\n\nRead More:\n\nRichard Sherman hopes new California law \u2018destroys the NCAA\u2019\n\nMaryland\u2019s Lorenzo Harrison III to have knee surgery, further depleting running back corps\n\nSally Jenkins: California law doesn\u2019t take from the NCAA.
