On some occasions, we earn revenue if you click the links and buy the products, but we never allow this to affect our coverage.\n\nCleansing\n\nAccording to Dr Bunting, one of the best things to do when reassessing your skincare routine for a new season is get back to basics.\n\nWhen it comes to cleansing, she recommends embracing the merits of a \u201cgentle, non-foaming wash-off cleanser\u201d and to avoid using excessively hot water as this will leach away your skin\u2019s essential lipids (natural fats that maintain the strength of the skin's protective barrier).\n\nDr Budh-Raja agrees, adding that you should ideally invest in a moisturising product that will not only help preserve skin\u2019s natural oils but will also hydrate skin.\n\nIf you're on the hunt for a new cleanser, consider picking up Tata Harper's Purifying Cleanser which is made using 100 per cent natural ingredients or Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cleanser which contains vitamin E to keep your skin moisturised. We also love Glow Recipe's Blueberry Bounce Gently Cleanser which works as a cleanser and deep-cleaning mask in one.\n\nExfoliating\n\nAfter months of fake tanning and long days at the beach, uneven skin tone can be a real concern for many people.\n\nBut, while it\u2019s important to get rid of the dead damaged cells, Dr Bunting recommends skipping \u201call forms of physical exfoliation, including flannels and cleansing brushes\u201d.\n\nInstead, look for products that are more gentle on the skin, like Caudalie's Gentle Buffing Cream, and rinse off with warm water.\n\nWe also recommend Milk Makeup's Cannabis Hydrating Face Mask or By Terry's Cellularose Dual Exfoliation Scrub, both of which are ultra-hydrating and suitable for sensitive skin.\n\nMoisturising\n\nIt is time to bid adieu to the lightweight moisturiser you\u2019ve been slathering on all summer and bulk up with a heftier hydrator.\n\nThe reason for this, Dr Budh-Raja says, it because \u201cskin becomes dry in autumn and winter due to the cold, reduced humidity and windy weather and therefore requires more hydration.\u201d\n\nWhile Dr Budh-Raja recommends investing in a cream that contains glycerin and hyaluronic acid to help hold in moisture, Dr Bunting suggests using a a barrier-bolstering moisturiser that contains ceramides and niacinamide which will \u201csupport your skin\u2019s outermost layer and help reduce sensitivity\u201d.\n\nFor super-hydrating creams, we suggest looking at It Cosmetics' Confidence in a Cream or La Roche-Posay's Nutritic Intense Riche Nutri-Reconstructing Cream, both of which help to soothe and comfort dry skin. Alternatively, splurge on Charlotte Tilbury's Charlotte\u2019s Magic Cream which is bursting with ingredients like collagen to transform your skin.\n\nIf you suffer from particularly dehydrated or damaged skin, serums will also make a great addition to your routine as they deliver a potent dose of hydration.\n\nWe recommend Oskia\u2019s Get Up & Glow which is designed to help speed repair and boost your complexion\u2019s defences against the elements.\n\nSPF\n\nBoth expert dematologists agree that sun protection shouldn\u2019t just be something you think about when you\u2019re headed to the beach.\n\nIn fact, your sun care routine should be year-round, come rain or shine.\n\nHowever, if you find that the SPF you\u2019ve been using throughout the summer just isn\u2019t cutting it, Dr Bunting recommends switching to a more nourishing formula to help keep your skin healthy and hydrated.\n\nFor a product that feels weightless under your makeup, we suggest picking up Kiehl\u2019s Ultra Light Daily Defense SPF50. Clinique's Super City Block SPF40 and Darphin's Intral Shield SPF50 are also great buys and double up as a shield from environmental aggressors.\n\nAcids\n\nCommon belief is that the use of actives can exacerbate dryness \u2013 something we already have enough of during the cooler months \u2013 and while this is true to some extent, that doesn\u2019t. mean you should stop using altogether come autumn.\n\n\u201cActives remain an important step, whatever the weather,\u201d Dr Bunting says.\n\n\u201cBut consider a gentler new-generation retinoid like granactive retinoid to boost your glow without leaving skin brittle and irritated.\u201d\n\nDr Budh-Raja agrees, adding that while you might need to reconsider the frequency you use ingredients like retinol, as long as you follow with plenty of moisturiser and SPF you skin will continue to reap the benefits.\n\nSome of our top picks include The Ordinary's Mandelic Acid for gentle exfoliation, Dr Sam's Flawless Nightly Serum which improves overall skin tone without irritation and Oskia's Retinoid Sleep Serum that gets to work during your slumber.", "description": "The days are getting shorter, temperatures are dropping and the leaves are beginning to fall.
