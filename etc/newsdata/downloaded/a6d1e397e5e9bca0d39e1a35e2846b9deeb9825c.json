He often criticised the forward, demanding more from him, and then went and signed Gabriel Jesus.\n\nThere was also concern that Aguero's time may be coming to an end when the pair were pictured in discussion at Italian restaurant Salvi's in Manchester in January 2017.\n\nPep Guardiola taught Sergio Aguero the intricacies of his tactical philosophy over dinner\n\nBut, in the latest serialisation of the new book 'Pep's City: The Making of a Superteam', it has been revealed that Guardiola planned the dinner to help Aguero learn his tactical style.\n\nThe manager wanted his striker to press more, hold onto the ball better and work as hard as the rest of the first team squad were to grasp Guardiola's style.\n\nIn an extract published by The Sun on Thursday night, Aguero said: 'Pep asked me to try a new way of playing and I had to adapt. It wasn't easy but I had no choice.\n\n'My game is totally different now from what I was doing five years ago at City. A total transformation. At that meal, we talked about loads of things.\n\n'We kept postponing it and then when we finally met up, we talked about work for 20 minutes or so. The rest of the meal we spent chatting about other stuff, family, life in general.'\n\nThe 31-year-old remains a crucial player for the reigning Premier League champions and has cemented himself as the club's No 1 striker, seeing of the threat of Jesus.\n\nThe manager wanted him to press more, hold onto the ball and work as hard as everyone else\n\nHe has 103 goals in his three full seasons and the first eight games of the new campaign under Guardiola, helping City to successive domestic titles.\n\nAguero admits he needed time to adapt to Guardiola's style but now sees the benefits of his tactics.\n\nHe added: 'When Pep arrived I was a bit taken aback by his intensity, it wasn't always easy to understand what he wanted.\n\n'With Pep, it can feel like he's putting a lot of pressure on you. You start thinking, \"I've got to play well\" and only end up putting even more pressure on yourself.\n\n'But I understood pretty quickly that's just how he is. Pep is super intense. He won't leave you alone for a second. There are no off days.'", "description": "Pep Guardiola taught Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero the intricacies of his tactical philosophy over dinner when the Spanish coach first arrived in English, it has been revealed.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/00/19563336-0-image-a-93_1570749094080.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
