After breaking Barty in the seventh game, victory was all but assured, despite an attempted comeback by the Queensland native in the final game.\n\nIn the men\u2019s final, top-seeded Austrian Dominic Thiem faces Greece\u2019s Stefanos Tsitsipas.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A surging Naomi Osaka won her second consecutive final with a three-set victory over top-seeded Ashleigh Barty at the China Open on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
