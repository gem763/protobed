If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. In the last year, Prism Johnson paid out 24% of its profit as dividends. With a low payout ratio, it looks like the dividend is comprehensively covered by earnings.\n\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Prism Johnson paid out 6.9% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservative and suggests the dividend is sustainable. It's positive to see that Prism Johnson's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nIs Prism Johnson's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Prism Johnson has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. With net debt of 2.85 times its EBITDA, Prism Johnson's debt burden is within a normal range for most listed companies.\n\nNet interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Interest cover of 1.92 times its interest expense is starting to become a concern for Prism Johnson, and be aware that lenders may place additional restrictions on the company as well.\n\nWe update our data on Prism Johnson every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. Prism Johnson has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was \u20b91.50 in 2009, compared to \u20b91.00 last year. This works out to be a decline of approximately 4.0% per year over that time. Prism Johnson's dividend hasn't shrunk linearly at 4.0% per annum, but the CAGR is a useful estimate of the historical rate of change.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like Prism Johnson Limited (NSE:PRSMJOHNSN) tend to be popular with investors, and for good...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NdLEqRToULbVvjOLr86W3A--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/0ab37fa010630fbd766ead19058752be", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
