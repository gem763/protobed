CBC Sports Anson Henry discusses the issue and the effect on the athletes. 2:16\n\nXavi is helping to promote Qatar's soccer credentials to a world skeptical of the choice of location for sport's premier quadrennial event. He also does damage control \u2014 the World Cup bidding process and the conditions for migrant workers building the event's infrastructure are two hot-button topics. Challenges abound\n\nFIFA is counting on rabid fans to travel no matter where the world's most popular sporting event is held because this World Cup faces challenges others haven't.\n\nThe oppressive summer heat forced FIFA to move the World Cup from its June-July slot to a November-December schedule that cuts into the club season in Europe and changes the habits of fans who are resistant to change.\n\nThose who make the trip will need to be open-minded, and patient, especially in the traffic on the Doha roads.\n\nFinding a beer won't be easy. Many hotels are dry and only one shop in the country sells booze to locally-based foreigners with employer approval.\n\nUnlike in Russia or Brazil \u2014 the past two hosts \u2014 there is not a vast variety of tourist attractions, beyond the national museum that is still being completed, the souk and trips into the desert. With all stadiums within an hour of Doha, the skyscraper and mall-filled capital will be the hub.\n\nWATCH | IAAF president Sebastian Coe on track & field controversies:\n\nSebastian Coe sits down with CBC's Scott Russell to chat Russia, Semenya and the future of track & field. 4:09\n\nWhat fans will not be able to do easily is hop across on a plane to the sprawling tourist resorts of Dubai, unless the United Arab Emirates and its regional allies restore diplomatic, economic and travel ties with Qatar that were severed in 2017 over allegations denied by Doha that it supports extremism. Infantio plays peacemaker\n\nThe IAAF and its local partners for the track worlds blamed the diplomatic dispute on the sparse crowds.\n\n\"You have to understand the political challenges this country faces right now, which was never envisaged when this meeting was awarded,\" IAAF chief executive Jon Ridgeon said.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino tried in the last year to play peacemaker, shuttling across the region in an attempt to broker a deal that would spread the tournament beyond Qatar. The Swiss-Italian administrator discovered how the rift runs so deep that it cannot be healed in a flash by dangling the prospect of hosting some games. \"A lion starts small but then he becomes big and the king of the jungle,\"\n\nBut the compact nature of the World Cup should allow fans to attend two or even three games a day depending on the traffic and the new Metro system. Organizers are also planning to make tickets cheaper than the track worlds, where the starting point was almost $20.\n\nThe West Bay skyline of Doha. (Getty Images)\n\nThe Metro line is still being completed to reach the stadium at Lusail, where workers are toiling in heat often exceeding 40 degrees to complete the 80,000-seat venue for the opening game and final in a city that didn't exist when Qatar won the FIFA vote in 2010. A small shelter where the centre circle will be offers respite from the fierce sun but not the humidity.\n\nPlayers and fans, though, will have far greater protection during the World Cup. Not only are temperatures unlikely to exceed 30 Celsius, but every stadium features massive cooling technology that will chill players and supporters alike.\n\nQataris have been emboldened by some success on the field \u2014 beating Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on its run to Asian Cup glory in February.\n\nIt didn't matter much to 16-year-old Mohammed Talal Almannai that the Qatari lost 4-1 in the first leg of the Champions League to Al Hilal.\n\n\"A lion starts small but then he becomes big and the king of the jungle,\" he said. \"That's what we will be. We need to bring more people into Qatar so they can learn about Arabic culture.\" Global ambitions\n\nSo much of the Qatari state's strategy to project soft power has been about harnessing the adulation for sports across the world by investing in teams \u2014 notably French soccer champion Paris Saint-Germain \u2014 and chasing hosting rights to major events.\n\nBut the world track and field championships showed the challenge convincing the world that Qatar has a culture of fandom and can fill stadiums.\n\nThe next major test is when Qatar hosts FIFA's Club World Cup this December and the following year as a testing ground for the sport's biggest event.\n\n\"It will be beautiful. It will be wonderful to see the World Cup in Qatar if you like football,\" said Michel Platini, the former FIFA vice-president who voted for Qatar and was later banned in an unconnected financial scandal. \"Football is more popular than track and field.\"", "description": "Following a sparsely attended world track and field championship\u00a0questions are once again being raised over Qatar's ability to host the 2022 World Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5313570.1570558890!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/qatar-wc-090319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
