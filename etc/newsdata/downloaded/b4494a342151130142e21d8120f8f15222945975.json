He was caught back behind the wheel two months after killing the men.\n\nLast night Mr Shackley\u2019s daughter Danielle, 31, told The Mail on Sunday: \u2018We are not getting any justice at all. How can you get behind the wheel of a car while you are high on drugs, kill two people and not go to prison for it?\u2019\n\nLawyers for the families say Coopey\u2019s account of the crash suggests he may have been speeding, which should have led to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) considering charging him with causing death by dangerous driving.\n\nThey believe the police investigation was \u2018flawed\u2019 and are \u2018baffled\u2019 why officers did not submit a file of evidence to the CPS. Thames Valley Police insists there is insufficient evidence to charge the teenager with causing the men\u2019s deaths.\n\nCoopey, who lives with his parents in a \u00a31 million house in Ascot, has shown no remorse. Rather than apologising when he appeared in court earlier this year, he complained about how the crash \u2018really has affected my mental well-being\u2019.\n\nA wife's grief: Sarah Imi with husband Jason. Max Coopey had smoked cannabis before ploughing his father\u2019s \u00a335,000 sports car into John Shackley, 61, and Jason Imi, 48, as they crossed the road near Ascot, Berkshire, last August\n\nKilled: John Shackley pictured with his granddaughter. Eight weeks before he killed the two men, Coopey had been stopped by police and found to be almost three-times over the drug-drive limit\n\nThe teenager\u2019s father is a sergeant in the Metropolitan Police and his mother worked for many years as a schools liaison constable working with pupils in London.\n\nCoopey had five previous convictions for drugs offences, robbery and common assault by the time he turned 18 earlier this year.\n\nApproached for comment, Coopey\u2019s mother said: \u2018We don\u2019t do trial by newspaper.\u2019\n\nIn a statement, the family later said: \u2018Our sympathy is with the families of Mr John Shackley and Mr Jason Imi following the tragic accident.\u2019\n\nEight weeks before he killed the two men, Coopey had been stopped by police and found to be almost three-times over the drug-drive limit. Yet Coopey\u2019s father still allowed him to borrow his 190-horsepower Audi A5 sports car on the night he killed the two men.\n\nHis victims, who were crossing the road, were struck with such force, they were flung over the roof of the car and died immediately (pictured: Floral tribute)\n\nCoopey picked up two friends and says he smoked \u2018one and a half joints of weed\u2019 before the crash at 11.30pm as he approached a dip in the road obscuring his view near the village of Sunninghill. His victims, who were crossing the road, were struck with such force, they were flung over the roof of the car and died immediately.\n\nCoopey called his father who rushed to the scene in a taxi and introduced himself to officers. Coopey, who was arrested on suspicion of drug driving and later found to have a level of 3.3 micrograms of cannabis in his system, susbsequently refused to co-operate with police.\n\nCoopey is due to be sentenced on Tuesday for driving while disqualified and not having insurance in October last year while he was awaiting trial for the drug driving charge connected with the men\u2019s death.\n\nIronically, he could face jail for ignoring the ban on getting behind the wheel.\n\n\u2018It would be a slap in the face to think he gets jailed for uninsured driving but not for killing two people,\u2019 said Mr Shackley\u2019s widow, Christine.", "description": "Max Coopey had smoked cannabis before ploughing his father's \u00a335,000 sports car into John Shackley, 61, and Jason Imi, 48, as they crossed the road near Ascot.
