Focus in Westminster is already shifting away from the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal, as the parties tool up for a gruelling prospect of a winter election campaign.\n\nBut Brexit still looms large over proceedings \u2013 and the prospect of a Final Say referendum could be boosted by the coming poll.\n\nThis parliament has repeatedly rejected attempts to attach a referendum to various bits of legislation, and despite shifting allegiances across all the parties, there has never been a clear majority for it.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis is the reason why the People\u2019s Vote campaign has urged MPs to hold off from pushing a vote on a second referendum \u2013 as they knew the support was not there.\n\nA new parliament might feel differently. If the Tories win a landslide victory, then Johnson will go for Brexit all guns blazing and hopes of second referendum will fade.\n\nBut under any other result, the prospect of a second referendum is still very much alive. A Labour-led coalition \u2013 or a Labour government with a majority \u2013 would most likely try to negotiate its own Brexit deal with the EU, with a focus on workers\u2019 rights and regulations. The party has previously said it believes it could achieve this in three months.\n\nIf this happens, Jeremy Corbyn has promised to put a Labour Brexit deal to a public vote after pressure from senior figures to deliver a Final Say.\n\nThe SNP could back Labour but its support would come at a price, as the party will almost certainly want a commitment for a second independence referendum in exchange for propping up a Corbyn government.\n\nIf the Liberal Democrats win a significant number of MPs and fall in with Labour, the party will push to go further and scrap Brexit altogether.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Conservative-led minority government, then fresh deadlock looms.

These MPs may face an uphill battle to keep their seats, as their former parties are likely to throw the kitchen sink at ousting them.\n\nJohnson will be praying for a thumping majority in order to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, but it remains to be seen whether he can deliver, leaving the prospect for a Final Say vote very much on the table.", "description": "After several failed attempts, Boris Johnson appears to have finally secured his general election.\u00a0Focus in Westminster is already shifting away from the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal, as the parties tool up for a gruelling prospect of a winter election campaign.
