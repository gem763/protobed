In 2016, the brokerage acquired one located in Britain and concluded a similar deal in Hannover, Germany, in 2018. Earlier this year, it bought a delivery facility in Monchengladbach near Dusseldorf.The combined value of the property purchases is 770 billion won.\u201cThe deal is considered great if the tenant\u2019s status is concrete,\u201d a source said. \u201cThe Amazon-leased one is relatively free from the worries about the abrupt leaving of tenants.\u201dBY PARK SEONG-WOO [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
