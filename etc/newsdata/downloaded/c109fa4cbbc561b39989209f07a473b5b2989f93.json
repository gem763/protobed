On Monday, the police cordoned off Barcelona's airport to prevent demonstrators protesting the verdict from disrupting air traffic. Footage shared online showed officers with batons clashing with crowds.\n\nMr Quim Torra, the separatist leader of the regional Catalan government, had called on citizens to demonstrate. He later also called for amnesty for the convicted leaders.\n\nThe verdict came before a repeat national election November 10. It was called after Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the caretaker Socialist prime minister, failed to get sufficient support from smaller parties in parliament to form a government. It will be Spain's fourth election in four years, highlighting the country's political polarization and fragmentation.\n\nThe decision Monday will have a direct impact on next month's national election because Mr Junqueras and five other condemned politicians had planned to run.\n\nThe verdicts were handed down just before some of the defendants completed two years in jail, after being denied bail. The prison sentences ranged from nine to 13 years, including 11.5 years for Carme Forcadell, who presided over the debates within the Catalan parliament in 2017.\n\nWhile the seven judges of the Supreme Court found the Catalan leaders guilty of sedition, they did not sentence them for rebellion, a crime that could have resulted in prison sentences as long as 25 years.\n\nBy discarding the charge of rebellion, the judges of the Supreme Court on Monday opened the door to a new attempt by Spain to extradite Mr Puigdemont, who fled alongside other members of his former Catalan government in late 2017 after they were ousted from office by the Spanish government, which used emergency constitutional powers to impose a period of direct rule over Catalonia.\n\nOver the past two years, Mr Puigdemont has successfully fought against extradition attempts from Belgium and Germany, where local judges rejected the Spanish claim that he had led a rebellion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a televised address to the nation, Mr S\u00e1nchez said the judges of the Supreme Court had given \"an example of autonomy and transparency\" that also helped confirm Spain \"as one of the best democracies in the world.\"\n\nHe added, \"In a democracy, nobody is judged for his ideas or to defending a political project, but for crimes inscribed within our judicial framework.\"\n\nMr S\u00e1nchez said the verdict \"opened a new stage\" for Catalonia, but he put the onus on Catalan society to resolve its own dispute over independence.\n\n\"What is at stake is cohabitation within Catalonia, not the territorial integrity of our country,\" he said.\n\nCenter-right Spanish politicians welcomed the ruling. Pablo Casado, the leader of the main opposition Popular Party, called on S\u00e1nchez to promise not use his executive right to grant an early pardon to the condemned Catalan politicians.\n\n\"Whoever does it, pays it,\"Mr Casado said.\n\nIn a televised news conference, Laura Borras, a separatist lawmaker, called the ruling \"profoundly anti-democratic\" and a violation not only of the rights of elected politicians but also of the more than 2 million people who voted for separatist parties in Catalonia in recent years.\n\n\"This is a ruling that creates irreparable damage,\" Ms Borras said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a separate address, Mr Torra, the Catalan president, pledged \"to continue advancing along the path toward independence, without excuses.\"\n\nIn an audio message recorded from prison, Mr Junqueras said the ruling was \"not justice, but vengeance. This is punishment for all those who live here, in Catalonia and in this society.\"\n\nThe former Catalan leaders could still appeal their case before Spain's Constitutional Court, if they could demonstrate that their fundamental rights had been violated, as well as to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.\n\nSome former Catalan leaders have been awaiting a separate European ruling on whether they should be granted immunity as elected members of the European Parliament, after winning their seats in European elections last May.\n\nAmong those elected to the European Parliament were Mr Puigdemont and Mr Junqueras, who is the leader of the Esquerra Republicana party that is now the largest Catalan force within the Spanish parliament.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The leaders who tried and failed to create an independent Catalan state have been sentenced to prison for up to 13 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2637%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_34/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/21c24e70b4b7374e4b1c4a70e0fcc8c945da1b74", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
