With such a deadline, the uncertainty if the UK needs to comply with 2019 ETS emissions will remain,\u201d said Yan Quin, senior carbon market analyst at Refinitiv.\n\nLevies under the ETS would be replaced by a carbon tax from Nov. 4 if Britain leaves the EU with no deal.\n\nAnalysts expect prices to rise next year from levels around 23.50 euros to an average of 34.50 euros a tonne in 2020 due to a market stability reserve (MSR) designed to remove surplus allowances.\n\nHowever, analysts warned that uncertainty over how coal plant closures are treated by member states could have an impact on future prices.\n\nGermany, Europe\u2019s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide and buyer of permits under the EU ETS, has announced plans to close coal-fired power plants by 2038, but it is unclear whether the country will also cancel some of its carbon allowances to prevent a surplus accumulating.", "description": "Analysts have lowered forecasts for the price of European Union carbon permits in the fourth quarter as the threat of a no-deal Brexit hangs over the market.", "authors": ["Susanna Twidale", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
