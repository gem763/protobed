John E. Moss.\n\nMoss was a firm believer in the powers of Congress and that the Framers of the constitution had placed those powers in Article I for very good reasons. Given the issues of the 1970s, such as federal agency deregulation initiated by the Ford administration, accusations of wiretapping by President Ford\u2019s executive branch and rising prices to consumers of oil and natural gas, among others, the Moss subcommittee was almost continuously in bare-knuckle conflict with the president and the executive branch over obtaining information that might lead to new legislation, oversight of existing laws, or possibly the disclosure of criminal conduct.\n\nThe long fights I was involved in, between Congress (through the Oversight subcommittee) and the executive branch (led by President Ford) and the results, may foreshadow the results of the current struggle between the House of Representatives led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWSJ: Sondland told the House that Trump's Ukraine pressure was a quid pro quo Schiff says committees are making 'rapid progress' in impeachment probe McConnell blasts impeachment inquiry as 'kangaroo court' in fundraising pitch MORE (D-Calif.) and the president.\n\nDuring my years with Moss and the subcommittee we became involved in at least three major clashes pitting congressional versus presidential powers. They all involved constitutional issues and current public policy and were spurred on by a determined congressman with strong backing from the leadership of the House (led by Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill) even as they were opposed by a new, relatively inexperienced but determined chief executive (Ford).\n\nThere was always, then as now, intense political pressure, the interest of the press and of sometimes fleeting public opinion and the need to move quickly.\n\nThe first fight was between the Moss subcommittee and Secretary of the Interior Rogers Morton over a list of U.S. companies that were complying with the Arab oil boycott of Israel in 1975. Morton claimed confidentiality for the list of boycotting companies, thus protecting the companies but presumably harming trade with Israel. The secretary refused to produce a list of the companies pursuant to a subcommittee subpoena and was voted in contempt. Moss called Morton before the subcommittee to respond. The Cabinet member yielded, but with a compromise: He would produce the documents only in executive session, not publicly. Nonetheless, it was a moral victory for Moss and the powers of Congress.\n\nThe second fight was over another subcommittee subpoena. This time it was for information from AT&T over alleged wiretapping of members of Congress, at the direction of the Justice Department and presumably the president. The company rejected the information demand and Justice sued the subcommittee on behalf of AT&T, asserting executive privilege. The subcommittee won before the Court of Appeals, thereby establishing the right of Congress to obtain wiretap records despite an executive privilege claim. But there was a major compromise: the Court of Appeals directed the two branches to negotiate the scope of the materials to be turned over.\n\nA climactic Moss battle with the White House had dramatic results for American consumers. Congress was then considering a bill to deregulate the price of natural gas, which would raise prices for consumers. Moss wanted natural gas reserve data from Ashland Oil and other energy companies. He believed it would prove the country was not running out of supplies, a major argument the industry was using to force deregulation.\n\nMoss, with the assistance of the Speaker of the House, won subpoena authorization. The industry was promptly subpoenaed to provide the information on the grounds of a legislative purpose. When the industry did not comply, the subcommittee sued for the reserve data. After a time-consuming lawsuit, the subcommittee won again in the D.C. Court of Appeals, establishing the right of Congress to get almost any information needed for an Article I- legislative purpose.\n\nThus, in my decade working for the House of Representatives, Congress won almost every legal battle for information the Moss subcommittee was involved in, including those where the executive branch raised presidential privilege. But, there were and remain some major problems in struggles between the branches of government over access to executive branch information.\n\nWhat I learned in my years with the Moss subcommittee is this. There must be a confluence of a determined legislative leader (John Moss in my case) a supportive Congress and, most important, the issues must gain and hold wide public attention (as did the Arab oil boycott, natural gas data and accusations of wiretapping of members of Congress).\n\nBut such Titanic struggles between Congress and the president take a long time to play out. They are eventually resolved, but that may take time--and sometimes time and public attention can run out.\n\nMichael R.
