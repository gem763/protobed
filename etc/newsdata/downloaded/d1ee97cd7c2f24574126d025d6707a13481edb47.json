It is currently in storage ahead of a planned unveiling in Manchester next month.\n\nShe said that while the council was \"aware there is some debate about Gandhi's life\", most people would see the statue, which was given to the city by the Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur (SRMD), \"in the context in which it was intended - to spread a message of peace, love and harmony\".\n\nA spokesman for the SRMD said it was \"non-political and is not aligned with any national government\".\n\nThe organisation welcomed \"a searching public discussion of the past [but] it is misleading to fixate on comments made in Gandhi's early life\", he said.\n\n\"Gandhi inspired African leaders, including Nelson Mandela, [and] this call is an extreme and limited interpretation [of him].\n\n\"Mahatma Gandhi is a citizen of the world and an icon of peace. The Manchester statue will celebrate the universal power of his message.\"\n\nThe group behind the letter has been approached for comment.", "description": "Activists say Mahatma Gandhi was anti-black and should not be celebrated in Manchester.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B2BB/production/_109255754_gandhi-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
