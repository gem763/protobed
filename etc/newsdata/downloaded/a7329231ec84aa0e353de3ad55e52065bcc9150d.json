He hired a private jet and, after a 33-minute flight, took a limousine from the airport. The church picked up his $6,769 travel bill.\n\nThat trip in September 2017 was emblematic of the secret history of Bransfield\u2019s lavish travel. He spent millions of dollars from his diocese on trips in the United States and abroad, records show, while many of his parishioners struggled to find work, feed their families and educate their children.\n\nAD\n\nPope Francis has said bishops should live modestly. During his 13 years as the leader of \u00adthe Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston, Bransfield took nearly 150 trips on private jets and some 200 limousine rides, a Washington Post investigation found. He stayed at exclusive hotels in Washington, Rome, Paris, London and the Caribbean.\n\nAD\n\nLast year, Bransfield stayed a week in the penthouse of a legendary Palm Beach, Fla., hotel, at a cost of $9,336. He hired a chauffeur to drive him around Washington for a day at a cost of $1,383. And he spent $12,386 for a jet to fly him from the Jersey Shore to a meeting with the pope\u2019s ambassador in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nBransfield was barred from public ministry in July after an internal church investigation found he had engaged in financial abuses and sexually harassed young priests, allegations Bransfield has denied. The Post previously obtained the investigative report and revealed its major findings, including that he spent $2.4 million of church funds on travel and gave $350,000 in cash gifts to other clerics.\n\nAD\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of Bransfield\u2019s travel expenditures, The Post reconstructed his movements in the year before he retired in September 2018. The reporting drew on receipts obtained by The Post, public flight records and the confidential findings of the church\u2019s own investigation as well as interviews with some of Bransfield\u2019s companions and travel company representatives.\n\nAD\n\nBransfield was outside of West Virginia for a total of almost four months, according to documents and interviews. Though most of that travel was not related to his duties in West Virginia, the diocese routinely covered Bransfield\u2019s expenses as well as those of the young priests who accompanied him, The Post found.\n\n\u201cThis is so much worse than we ever imagined,\u201d Michael Iafrate, a church activist in West Virginia, said when told about The Post\u2019s reporting. \u201cIt is profoundly, morally wrong.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Bransfield, 76, did not dispute the findings but defended his frequent vacations as necessary breaks from his religious responsibilities.\n\nAD\n\nBransfield said he never made travel arrangements for himself, and he blamed his aides for selecting luxury accommodations, including the penthouse in Palm Beach. \u201cI did not arrange that room,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was done by staff.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe said much of his travel was related to his role as president of the Papal Foundation, a nonprofit entity that raises money from wealthy Catholics for Vatican initiatives.\n\n\u201cUsually it was business,\u201d he said.\n\nThe church\u2019s internal investigation, completed in February, found that three of Bransfield\u2019s top aides had enabled him. After The Post reported on the probe\u2019s findings in June, the diocese announced that the aides had resigned from their administrative positions. They have not responded to interview requests.\n\nAD\n\nBransfield could face financial consequences for his actions. Pope Francis has said the former West Virginia bishop must \u201cmake personal amends,\u201d and in response to questions from The Post, the diocese said it may seek to recover money Bransfield spent inappropriately.\n\nIn a statement, the diocese said Bransfield\u2019s successor, Bishop Mark Brennan, has launched an internal audit \u201cto determine what, if any, of Bransfield\u2019s expenses were connected to Church business.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf Bishop Bransfield is not cooperative, Bishop Brennan has stated he intends to exercise his unilateral authority to recover funds that we can determine were primarily used for personal benefit,\u201d the diocese said.\n\nAD\n\nBransfield arrived in West Virginia in 2005 after a quarter-century in Washington in various posts at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Catholic church in North America.\n\nBransfield told The Post that he had grown accustomed to the comfortable lifestyle he led in those years. He had befriended celebrities and politicians, including former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who credited Bransfield and others at the National Shrine with helping convert him to Catholicism. His allies and friends included some of the most powerful clerics in the country.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nIn West Virginia, Bransfield took responsibility for a vast diocese in great need. Nearly 1 in 5 state residents lived in poverty, the opioid epidemic was spreading and even coal mining jobs \u2014 a mainstay of West Virginia\u2019s hardscrabble economy \u2014 were hard to come by.\n\nAD\n\nBransfield had access to an obscure source of riches. More than a century ago, a New York heiress donated land in West Texas to the West Virginia diocese. The land turned out to be rich with oil, generating annual revenue of almost $15 million in recent years.\n\nBransfield did not call attention to that revenue publicly, but the diocese drew on it to cover his travel expenses and other personal spending, according to the confidential investigative report. During his 13 years in West Virginia, Bransfield spent $4.6 million on renovations to his church residence, almost $140,000 at restaurants, $62,000 on jewelry, and thousands on alcohol, the report shows.\n\nAD\n\nBy his final year, records show, Bransfield\u2019s use of private jets and limousines had become routine \u2014 even as the diocese closed or cut funding for nearly two dozen parishes and parochial schools.\n\nAD\n\nOn Sept. 16, 2017, as parishioners traveled by bus for the pilgrimage to the National Shrine, Bransfield boarded an 11-seat Learjet.\n\nWhen Bransfield arrived at Dulles International Airport, a hired luxury car was waiting outside a small terminal devoted to executive jets, according to receipts from the chauffeur service Limolink. The firm told The Post that its fleet is primarily made up of Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs. The ride to the National Shrine and back to the jet several hours later cost $440, receipts show.\n\nIn his last year, Bransfield flew by chartered luxury jet at least 19 times at a cost of over $142,000, according to receipts from Skyward Aviation, a charter firm that provides \u201cconcierge\u201d service for well-heeled travelers from an airport about 30 miles from the diocesan headquarters. During his entire tenure in West Virginia, Bransfield spent almost $1 million on private jets, according to the investigative report.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWelcome to luxury and comfort at its finest,\u201d Skyward Aviation says on its website.\n\nBransfield\u2019s use of private jets was no secret to two of the pope\u2019s close advisers. The Vatican\u2019s diplomatic representative in the United States, Christophe Pierre, and his predecessor Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 each rode on a jet paid for by the diocese, according to receipts and interviews.\n\nPierre\u2019s July 24, 2017, flight back to Washington from a Boy Scouts event in Charleston, W.Va., cost $7,596.\n\nPierre and officials in his office did not respond to requests for comment about the previously unreported flight.\n\nVigan\u00f2 previously told The Post he did not know his 2013 flight \u2014 also to a Boy Scouts event \u2014 was paid for by the West Virginia diocese.\n\nA Vatican spokesman did not respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nBransfield also routinely traveled in luxury overseas. During his tenure, he visited Paris, London and Geneva, often flying first-class and staying in leading hotels, and was at times accompanied by young priests, according to records and interviews.\n\nAD\n\nOne of those priests is the Rev. Andrew Fisher, the pastor at St. Ambrose Catholic Church in Annandale, Va., who worked with Bransfield at the National Shrine. Fisher described the trips \u2014 including at least four to Paris and London \u2014 as \u201ca blend of vacation and work.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter he moved to West Virginia, I was asked to take a number of trips as his guest and was told the trips were paid for out of the bishop\u2019s personal finances,\u201d Fisher said in a statement. \u201cI had no role in selecting the accommodations or making travel arrangements, and I was unaware of the costs.\u201d\n\nIn late October 2017, Bransfield asked a cleric in his mid-20s to accompany him on a trip to Rome, according to the confidential investigative report. The priest, based in West Virginia, only reluctantly agreed. He had confided to one of the bishop\u2019s top aides that Bransfield had once slapped his buttocks during a summer party, the report said.\n\nThe Post generally does not name the victims of alleged sexual harassment. He declined to comment.\n\nThe pair visited Castel Gandolfo, a lakeside village south of Rome, according to the investigative report. During the visit, Bransfield upset the priest by again slapping him on the buttocks, the investigative report said.\n\nBransfield has denied any inappropriate contact with priests or seminarians.\n\nSeveral weeks after returning to West Virginia, Bransfield took another charter jet to Washington, for a meeting of the Philadelphia-based Papal Foundation. The group is run by U.S. cardinals and was founded by a close ally of Bransfield\u2019s, then-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was defrocked earlier this year for sexual abuse.\n\nAs president of the group, Bransfield helped manage more than $225 million in total assets, according to internal Papal Foundation documents. He also used private jets and limousines paid for by his diocese to visit wealthy Catholic contributors.\n\nBransfield arrived in the nation\u2019s capital several days before the foundation\u2019s December 2017 meeting. He racked up nearly $2,000 in bills at the Hay-Adams Hotel, which overlooks the White House. Bransfield dined at the Capital Grille in Chevy Chase, Md., and at Cafe Milano in Georgetown. He also spent $400 at Nieman Marcus, documents show.\n\nIn an interview with The Post, Bransfield lamented the lack of shopping opportunities in the Mountain State. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the opportunity in West Virginia to live the lifestyle I lived in Washington,\u201d he said.\n\nA favorite store in the nation\u2019s capital was Ann Hand Collection, a boutique jeweler where he spent $61,785, according to the investigative report.\n\nOwner Ann Hand said in an interview that Bransfield often visited the showroom and bought pins, cuff links and silk scarves for friends and colleagues. Bransfield blessed the shop when it moved to its location in Georgetown several years ago, she said.\n\nHand expressed surprise when told how much church money Bransfield spent on the gifts.\n\n\u201cThat is shocking it would be that much,\u201d Hand said. \u201cI guess I honestly thought he was a priest who had his own money.\u201d\n\nOn the final day of his D.C. visit, Bransfield attended the Papal Foundation meeting. The Dec. 12 gathering brought together top U.S. Catholic leaders and a handful of wealthy Catholic donors who helped steer the foundation.\n\nBransfield assured the donors that Pope Francis would meet with them to acknowledge their generosity during the group\u2019s annual pilgrimage to Rome in the spring, according to minutes of the meeting.\n\nAfterward, Bransfield stepped out of the Vatican\u2019s embassy on Massachusetts Avenue and got into a limousine that took him to a private jet waiting to fly him back to West Virginia, according to a Limolink receipt.\n\nNearly two weeks later, at midnight on Christmas Eve, Bransfield was standing at the altar at the Cathedral of St. Joseph in Wheeling, W.Va. He was surrounded by red and white poinsettias. He celebrated a Mass that was broadcast on television stations across the state.\n\nHours later, he was gone again.\n\nOn Christmas afternoon in 2017, he flew by private jet to Philadelphia, his hometown. He hosted a holiday soiree at a catering hall not far from a Philadelphia home he owns \u2014 at a cost to the diocese of more than $5,000, according to a person familiar with the event who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private matter.\n\nOn Dec. 28, Bransfield and another Philadelphia priest, the Rev. Monsignor Charles P. Vance, flew on American Airlines to Palm Beach International Airport. Records show Bransfield routinely took winter vacations at the diocese\u2019s expense \u2014 and not just to Florida but to the Cayman Islands, St. Maarten and St. Barthelemy in the Caribbean.\n\nAs a tax-exempt charity, the church is prohibited from spending on luxuries or services that unduly benefit an individual.\n\nIn Palm Beach, Bransfield and Vance stayed for a week at the Colony, a boutique hotel that hosted Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. and George W. Bush and once was a favorite of British royalty.\n\nFrom Dec. 28, 2017, to Jan. 4, 2018, the two clerics stayed in the Presidential Penthouse, a 1,640-square-foot spread with two bedrooms as well as living and dining rooms and a private sun deck, according to a hotel executive, accounting manager Mimi Hector.\n\nOver the years, Bransfield spent almost $50,000 of the diocese\u2019s money at the hotel, sometimes for multiple rooms, records show.\n\nIn his Post interview, Bransfield described the hotel as \u201ca very classy little place,\u201d convenient to the beach and Palm Beach\u2019s legendary shopping district. Yet he called the choice of the suite an error of judgment by his staff.\n\n\u201cIt only happened once,\u201d Bransfield said. \u201cI made sure it was not repeated.\u201d\n\nHector told The Post that Bransfield had previously stayed in another of the Colony\u2019s premium suites \u2014 the Duke of Windsor Penthouse.\n\nFor the return flight from Palm Beach, Bransfield did not use his round-trip ticket on American Airlines. He never sought a refund for the return portion of the $2,854 trip, an airline representative said.\n\nInstead, he took a private jet from Palm Beach International Airport to the airport near his residence in Wheeling.\n\nBransfield said he did not recall forgoing the commercial flight.\n\n\u201cI had nothing to do with arranging the flights,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was staff.\u201d\n\nVance, the pastor of St. Philip Neri Church in Lafayette Hill, Pa., traveled to Palm Beach with Bransfield for winter vacation four times in recent years. He told The Post that he assumed that the trips and related expenses were \u201cgifts\u201d from Bransfield\u2019s diocese.\n\n\u201cI never felt comfortable in Palm Beach,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just too extravagant for me.\u201d\n\nVance said he had nothing to do with the arrangements.\n\n\u201cI was just a guest,\u201d said Vance, who had attended seminary with Bransfield. \u201cAs far as I knew, it was something they were doing for him. It was arranged by his staff.\u201d\n\nBransfield flew south twice more last winter at church expense.\n\nIn late January, he visited Miami Beach for a week-long vacation with the same young priest who accompanied him to Rome. Bransfield\u2019s aide, Monsignor Kevin Quirk, the judicial vicar of the West Virginia diocese, instructed the priest to accompany Bransfield because \u201cthere is no one else\u201d willing to go, according to the investigative report. The priest reluctantly agreed, according to the investigative report.\n\nQuirk did not respond to requests for an interview.\n\nBransfield also spent four days in Aruba in March. In an interview, he described the visit as \u201ca small vacation.\u201d\n\nIn April 2018, when Bransfield returned to Rome with Papal Foundation contributors, he took a side trip to relax. This getaway was in the seaside village of Positano, on Italy\u2019s Amalfi Coast.\n\n\u201cI was working very hard,\u201d Bransfield told The Post. \u201cAnd I took two or three days off. That was strictly personal.\u201d\n\nBransfield racked up a $3,333 bill staying at Le Sirenuse, regularly ranked in leisure magazines as one of Europe\u2019s finest hotels, records show.\n\n\u201cI did not pick the hotel,\u201d Bransfield said. \u201cSomeone else did.\u201d\n\nBransfield declined to say who selected the hotel.\n\nTwo weeks after returning to West Virginia, Bransfield was again headed to Washington aboard a private jet. A limousine picked him up at 11:09 a.m., a receipt shows. Bransfield stopped at the Vatican diplomatic office and another church facility. While the limousine waited, he got a haircut at Salon ILO in Georgetown, according to a salon employee. The diocese covered the $80 haircut, records show.\n\nA growing number of Bransfield\u2019s subordinates, including some of his closest aides, were privately grumbling about his financial and sexual conduct, according to interviews and the investigative report.\n\nComplaints about Bransfield\u2019s financial activity were not new. Parishioners in the state had sent letters to Vatican officials six years earlier seeking an investigation of his spending, The Post previously reported. Four senior clerics in the United States and at the Vatican who received written complaints about Bransfield in previous years had also received cash gifts from the bishop.\n\nBut in the summer of 2018, the allegations took on a new significance.\n\nTwo young priests who had traveled with Bransfield overseas had gone to Baltimore Archbishop William Lori with claims that Bransfield sexually harassed them. In August, Quirk wrote an eight-page letter with allegations about financial abuses, including that Bransfield spent money excessively on travel, according to a copy obtained by The Post.\n\nQuirk made many of the travel arrangements, according to the travel receipts.\n\nAt the time of Quirk\u2019s Aug. 8 letter, Bransfield was on his annual vacation on the Jersey Shore, where he regularly spent up to a month with family members and friends, with the diocese footing many of the bills. He made a $276 purchase at one of his regular stops each summer: a liquor store in Somers Point, N.J. He spent $1,002 at the Flanders Hotel in Ocean City, and he rented a car for the month at a cost of $2,975.\n\nOn Aug. 25, Bransfield was summoned to the nunciature in Washington. Instead of driving down Interstate 95 \u2014 a trip that could take up to four hours \u2014 he chartered a private jet from Atlantic City. He hopped into a limousine for the trip to the nunciature, the Vatican\u2019s diplomatic office in Washington, receipts show.\n\nBransfield told The Post that that was when he first learned that his job was imperiled.\n\n\u201cIt was the worst day of my life,\u201d Bransfield said.\n\nHe took the jet back to the Jersey Shore.\n\nAndrew Ba Tran contributed to this report.", "description": "The Catholic cleric spent millions of dollars of his diocese\u2019s money on sumptuous living during his 13 years in largely impoverished West Virginia.", "authors": ["Shawn Boburg", "Investigative Reporter", "Robert O'Harrow Jr.", "Investigative Reporter Covering The Trump Administration", "Technology"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-Cnxzv8XIOpSZsdfjgx0NdgUFxs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HFFGKJGVPAI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg"}
