The baled tyres are sold to exporters at around 260 pounds per container.\n\nExporters then arrange sales to Indian importers. While their margins are slim - around 60 pounds per container - these firms ship hundreds of containers every month.\n\nImporters in places like India and Malaysia told Reuters they pay between $1,500-$2,500 per container of tyres, around 75 percent of which is the shipping cost.\n\nBUYERS AND BURNERS\n\nOnce in India, the tyres are dispersed between recyclers who shred them for use in road-building or sports fields, firms that burn them as cheap fuel to make cement or bricks, and pyrolysis operations that turn the waste rubber into low-quality oil, carbon black and scrap metal.\n\nFor each container of tyres, backyard pyrolysis operations can make around $2,500 worth of oil, $300 of steel scrap and $200 of carbon black, according to plant operators. That means a profit of between $500 to $1,500 per container.\n\nGiven that rudimentary Chinese-made pyrolysis machines can be bought for as little as $30,000, backyard businesses can quickly make back their money.\n\nThe problem is that the cheap machines are also highly polluting. More sophisticated equipment that limit emissions and waste can cost ten times more in India, according to local authorities.
