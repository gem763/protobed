Teams from both sides will work over the weekend to explore whether they can arrive at the basis of an accord ahead of a summit of EU leaders that begins Thursday.\n\nThe pound posted its biggest two-day gain in a decade, while U.K. bank stocks soared -- but both sides cautioned that much work remains to be done if Britain is to leave the EU by Johnson\u2019s Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nAt issue are Johnson\u2019s plans to take Northern Ireland out of Europe\u2019s customs union and give Stormont, its power-sharing assembly, a veto over the arrangement. The first would trigger the return of checks on goods crossing the border, something Dublin and the EU are opposed to, while the second would hand the Democratic Unionist Party an effective veto over the deal, something unacceptable south of the border.\n\nCan Johnson Get a Deal Through Parliament? Silence Is Golden\n\nBut in a meeting with envoys of the bloc\u2019s remaining 27 countries on Friday, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, suggested that Johnson is softening his stance on both customs and consent. In what would potentially be a significant climb-down, Johnson acknowledged there should be no customs border on the island of Ireland, two officials said. When asked in a pooled interview for British television, Johnson declined to say whether Northern Ireland will leave the EU\u2019s customs union.\n\n\u201cThere is a joint feeling that there is a way forward, that we can see a pathway to a deal\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a done deal. There\u2019s work to be done.\u201d\n\nCompromises Considered\n\nEU officials think the only solution will be an arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland in the customs union -- the so-called Northern Ireland-only backstop.\n\nNegotiators\u2019 focus will now be on whether the deal is explicit in that or whether the two sides can come up with a compromise that could see Northern Ireland remain in the customs territories of both the U.K. and the EU, the officials said.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no discussion yet of putting a time limit on the arrangements -- something the EU has previously rejected -- one EU official said that it could yet be considered.\n\nAny agreement would have to be backed by Parliament in London, where Johnson is reliant on the DUP. The group is staunchly opposed to the region being subject to different customs rules to the rest of the U.K.\n\nIn a statement, DUP Leader Arlene Foster fired a warning shot against any attempt to keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union, although, crucially, she didn\u2019t go as far as explicitly withholding support from the prime minister.\n\n\u201cThose who know anything about Northern Ireland will appreciate that these issues will only work with the support of the unionist as well as the nationalist community,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018Workable, Realistic Proposal\u2019\n\nWhile negotiations are heading into a new intensive phase, they aren\u2019t headed into the full \u201ctunnel,\u201d the formal Brussels process by which the actual legal text of an agreement is thrashed out in secret.\n\nThis suggests that the EU still has reservations about the chances of getting a deal done, and that member states are unwilling to outsource the process entirely to Barnier and his team.\n\nThe Frenchman will update the EU\u2019s national envoys Sunday, with the aim of having something concrete for EU affairs ministers to look at when they meet in Luxembourg on Tuesday to prepare for the summit.\n\nFor all the fresh optimism, there is still a long way to go.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the U.K. hadn\u2019t yet \u201ccome forward with a workable, realistic proposal.\u201d But he added that he had seen \u201cpromising signals.\u201d The next week will see whether those noises turn into an agreement on paper.\n\n(Updates to add EU envoys to meet Sunday in 15th paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Dara Doyle, Nikos Chrysoloras and Alexander Weber.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ian Wishart in Brussels at iwishart@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Edward Evans, Robert Jameson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow\u00a0@Brexit,\u00a0sign up\u00a0to our Brexit Bulletin, and\u00a0tell us your Brexit story.\u00a0The U.K. and European Union signaled a Brexit deal is in sight, with negotiators heading into three days of intensive talks in Brussels.On Friday, EU officials said that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson", "authors": ["Ian Wishart"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
