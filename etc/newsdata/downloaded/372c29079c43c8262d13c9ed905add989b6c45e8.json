The Dow dropped 142.70 points, or 0.52%, to finish at 27,076.82. The S&P 500 lost 9.43 points, or 0.31%, to close at 2997.96, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 23.17 points, or 0.28%, to close at 8153.54.\n\nOil prices soared Monday following an attack on Saudi Arabian infrastructure over the weekend. The disruption hurt production by about 5.7 million barrels a day\u2014roughly half of Saudi\u2019s productive capacity and 5% of the globe\u2019s output.\n\nAs traders expect supplies to squeeze, Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, shot up 14.6% from last Friday to trade at $69.02 a barrel on Monday. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, also settled 14.7% higher at $62.90 a barrel. This marks the biggest single-day gain for both benchmarks since 2008, and one of their largest advances of the past 30 years. Higher oil prices also made energy stocks the best performers of the S&P 500 on Monday, rising 3.4% as most other sectors closed in the red.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nMore expensive fuels would be particularly bad news for transportation and logistics companies, for whom the commodity is a key expense. But higher oil prices might become the much-needed catalyst for the long-suffering value stocks\u2014or the market\u2019s cheapest ones\u2014as they have a bigger exposure to the cheaply priced energy stocks than their growth peers.\n\nStill, many believe that the disruption in Saudi\u2019s infrastructure will likely be only temporary, and its effect on the U.S. economy would be limited. Saudi Arabia is working to bring its production back on line as soon as possible\u2014although might be later than initially expected. President Donald Trump also said that he\u2019s authorized the release of oil, if needed, from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help offset cost increases. Unlike countries that rely on energy imports such as China and Japan, the U.S. has doubled its oil production over the past decade and surpassed Saudi Arabia as the world\u2019s top producer.\n\nChina\u2019s industrial production rose only 4.4% in August from a year ago, missing the consensus expectation for 5.2%, and under the 4.8% growth in the prior month. The latest reading marks a further drop in the sector\u2019s momentum and the weakest level in the metric\u2019s 17-year history.\n\nWeakness in auto demand remained a key driver, smartphone sales\u2014after holding up well through June\u2014also fell by double-digits in August. The weakness, according to Michael Shaoul of Marketfield Asset Management, may reflect the elevated pressure from trade tensions on particular pockets of the economy. At the same time, other sectors, such as housing and public infrastructure remained strong.\n\n\u201cThis divergence can be explained both by the concentrated impact of the trade dispute and the split in the availability of credit between those areas dependent on bank loans and bond issuance (housing, infrastructure and large-cap corporations) and those dependent on shadow banking (smaller enterprises),\u201d Shaoul wrote in a Monday note.\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com", "description": "All three main stock indexes closed modestly lower on Monday, despite the soaring oil price and rising energy stocks.
