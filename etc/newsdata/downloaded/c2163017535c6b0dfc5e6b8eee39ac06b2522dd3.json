Keenum even got a book deal out of it: \u201cPlaying for More: Beyond What You Can See.\u201d The NFL ranks the Keenum-to-Diggs stunner as the ninth greatest play in league history.\n\nBut standing at a lectern in Ashburn on Tuesday, Keenum was in no mood to reminisce.\n\nJust two days before he faces his former team for the first time since leaving in free agency after the 2017 season, he was focused on more current concerns. The 31-year-old is on a short week, trying to overcome two rough outings in a row.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played long enough to where I feel like if I keep going like I\u2019m going, I might play against my old team every week,\u201d said Keenum, who was acquired from Denver in the offseason.\n\nThe Redskins are Keenum\u2019s fifth team in six years, and in Washington, so far, he\u2019s shown why. After a strong start to the season, Keenum has faded. Even in Sunday\u2019s rain-soaked affair against the San Francisco 49ers \u2014 in which he threw just 12 times \u2014 there were missed opportunities.\n\nKeenum has battled through foot and shoulder injuries, but said he\u2019s doing \u201cwell\u201d enough to play in Minnesota.\n\nKeenum hasn\u2019t been able to recreate the success he had with the Vikings. That year, he started out as the team\u2019s backup but took over when Sam Bradford went down with an injury after just one game. Keenum finished the season with a career-high 22 touchdowns and led the Vikings into the playoffs.\n\nMinnesota, though, chose to let Keenum walk at the end of the year \u2014 signing former Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins to a fully guaranteed three-year, $84 million deal.\n\n\u201cYeah it was really hard,\u201d Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said on a conference call. \u201cCase did an awful lot for us here. Case was a terrific teammate, he had an outstanding year.\n\nWith Cousins at the controls in Minnesota, results have been mixed, but the Vikings (5-2) are suddenly on a roll. After last season\u2019s disappointing 8-7-1, Cousins looks more comfortable in a redesigned scheme tailored to his strengths. Cousins has played particularly well the last three weeks \u2014 completing 75% of his passes while throwing for 976 yards in an attack that relies heavily on play action.\n\nKeenum doesn\u2019t dwell on being passed over by the Vikings \u2014 the NFL, after all, is a business he said. He also downplays the significance of facing the Vikings, noting he has played against his former teams before.\n\nRunning back Adrian Peterson doesn\u2019t buy it, though.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s something there,\u201d said Peterson, who spent 10 years in Minnesota. \u201cOf course, after the season he had \u2026 I\u2019m sure he feels some type of way about that. We\u2019re all human. But who wouldn\u2019t? I\u2019m sure he wants to stick it to them, just like I want to stick it to \u2019em, and just like Kirk Cousins wants to stick it to us.\u201d\n\nFor now, the Redskins sound committed to sticking with Keenum. Despite rookie Dwayne Haskins waiting to make his first start, interim coach Bill Callahan expressed a vote of confidence in Keenum after the 49ers loss.\n\nWhen Keenum steps on the field in Minnesota, he\u2019ll likely receive a warm welcome. For Vikings fans, it would be hard not to think of the positive memories Keenum produced, especially his throw to Diggs.\n\n\u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t have any miracles on Thursday,\u201d Vikings tight end Kyle Rudolph told reporters in Minnesota. \u201cThat\u2019s for sure. That would not be good if Case is on the other end of a miracle on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI love Case, appreciate everything he did. I hope that Minnesota, Minneapolis was his last miracle in U.S. Bank Stadium.\u2019\u2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
