(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nIn a Corner post below, I quoted James Mattis\u2019 autobiography, and his assessment of U.S. foreign policy in 2012: \u201cI was disappointed and frustrated that policymakers all too often failed to deliver clear direction. And lacking a defined mission statement, I frequently didn\u2019t know what I was expected to accomplish.\u201d Considering today\u2019s news, it is fair to wonder how much has changed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also fair to wonder how much will change, even if there\u2019s a new president taking office January 20, 2021.\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump ran for president while promising to simultaneously \u201ctake the oil,\u201d bring the troops home, and \u201cbomb the [excrement] out of ISIS,\u201d while also \u201cletting Russia take on the Islamic State.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s stated desires and goals were often contradictions, but not many voters seemed to mind, because a lot of voters want contradictory things, too. They want terrorists to be attacked and destroyed until they\u2019re not a danger anymore, and they also want all U.S. military forces to be kept out of harm\u2019s way. They want the Pentagon to have the power to hit any target, anywhere, anytime, quickly enough to disrupt an attack or other calamity, but also don\u2019t want our troops stationed abroad as a potential target for IEDs, suicide bombers, mortars, car bombs, and so on. They want to support allies like Israel or pro-American kingdoms, but they don\u2019t like populations of Islamists hating us because we support allies like Israel or pro-American kingdoms. They want America to stop being the world\u2019s policeman, and then nod in agreement to the words \u201cnever again,\u201d on Holocaust Remembrance Day. We want all the good parts of foreign policy, but none of the bad parts.\n\nA good leader has to level with the American people and tell them the facts that they don\u2019t want to hear. Foreign policy and national security rarely give us easy answers, or win-win scenarios, or no-risk scenarios. Tradeoffs are inevitable, as are disappointments, setbacks, accidents, and provocations by hostile states. Oftentimes there is not a good option, only competing varieties of bad options. Our choices are to live with the risks of engagement or the risks of disengagement.\n\nDonald Trump is pretty bad at leveling with the American people about difficult choices. But it\u2019s worth noting that the alternative on the other side of the aisle is a big jumble of contradictory impulses and desires as well, and comparably shameless in their promises. Asked about terrorism in Afghanistan in the last debate, Elizabeth Warren responded:\n\nWe need to treat the problem of terrorism as a worldwide problem, and that means we need to be working with all of our allies, our European allies, our Canadian allies, our Asian allies, our allies in Africa and in South America. We need to work together to root out terrorism.\n\nWork with our allies! What an original and groundbreaking suggestion!\n\nPressed further by George Stephanopolous, Warren added, \u201cWe need to work with the rest of the world. We need to use our economic tools. We need to use our diplomatic tools. We need to build with our allies. And we need to make the whole world safer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoments later, Pete Buttigieg added, \u201cif there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned about Afghanistan, from Afghanistan, it\u2019s that the best way not to be caught up in endless war is to avoid starting one in the first place.\u201d Did the U.S. start the war in Afghanistan? Or did al-Qaeda start it with the 9/11 attacks?\n\nJoe Biden seemed to suggest Afghanistan could be calmed by splitting the country into three, which just happens to echo his preferred policy on Iraq about a decade ago:\n\nThe whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counterinsurgency, meaning that we\u2019re going to put that country together. It cannot be put together. Let me say it again. It will not be put together. It\u2019s three different countries. Pakistan owns the three counties \u2014 the three provinces in the east. They\u2019re not any part of \u2014 the Haqqanis run it. I will go on and on. But here\u2019s the point. The point is that it\u2019s a counterterrorism strategy. We can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases \u2014 insist the Pakistanis provide bases for us to air lift from and to move against what we know. We don\u2019t need those troops there. I would bring them home.\n\nBiden seems convinced that stationing smaller groups of U.S. troops at Pakistani air bases and sending the rest home will provide Americans with all of the counter-terrorism they need. It seems odd that the benefits of this apparently self-evidently brilliant plan have eluded all of the U.S. military strategists, planners, intelligence analysts, and troops on the ground.\n\nAnd then there was Bernie Sanders:\n\nI think that what we have got to do is bring this world together \u2014 bring it together on climate change, bring it together in fighting against terrorism. And make it clear that we as a planet, as a global community, will work together to help countries around the world rebuild their struggling economies and do everything that we can to rid the world of terrorism. But dropping bomb on Afghanistan and Iraq was not the way to do it.\n\n\u201cBring the world together.\u201d \u201cDo everything we can to rid the world of terrorism.\u201d Thank God he\u2019s here to come up with these ideas.\n\nYes, it\u2019s hard to give a good or detailed answer about foreign policy and national security, off the cuff, in one minute and fifteen seconds. But these are word salads, and to the extent they promise anything, it\u2019s a return to Obama administration policies that, a broad bipartisan consensus would agree, did not generate the results we wanted to see.", "description": "A good leader has to level with the American people and tell them the facts that they don\u2019t want to hear.
