They also underscore why previous presidents generally avoid actions like attacking the Federal Reserve: in part to avoid triggering market volatility.\n\nJPMorgan has a new index \u2014 called the \u201cVolfefe Index\u201d \u2014 that measures Trump\u2019s tweets and their impact on bond volatility.

The market-impacting tweets also tend to be retweeted and \u201cliked\u201d less by Trump\u2019s followers.\n\nHere are the words Trump most frequently uses in this genre.\n\n\n\n(3/x) pic.twitter.com/AalBMR7PXT \u2014 Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) September 8, 2019\n\nThe days Trump tweets more frequently than his normal rate have also been linked to negative stock market returns, according to an analysis by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nOf some 4,000 non-retweet messages posted by Trump during market hours from 2018 to the present, 146 moved the market, according to JP Morgan\u2019s analysis. He has tweeted an average of at least ten times a day since the start of 2016, but the volume since then has surged in recent months, triggering more volatility, according to the firm.\n\nTrump\u2019s impact on markets appears to be a growing issue. He was accused by some critics last month of hyping upcoming trade talks with China \u2014 with a suspect claim they had been requested by Beijing \u2014 to give the stock market a fake boost. Chinese officials said at the time they knew of no such request.", "description": "\"Price dynamics\" are increasingly \"beholden to a handful of tweets from the commander-in-chief,\" analysts warn.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d758ad0230000c7035127f6.jpeg?cache=zz80cllso1&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
