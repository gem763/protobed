Many waved billowing Lebanese flags and insisted the protests should remain peaceful and non-sectarian.\n\nThe demonstrators are demanding a sweeping overhaul of Lebanon\u2019s political system, citing grievances ranging from austerity measures to poor infrastructure.\n\nThey have blocked main roads and threatened to topple the country\u2019s fragile coalition government.\n\nMost Lebanese politicians have uncharacteristically admitted the demonstrations are spontaneous, rather than blaming outside influences.\n\nDemonstrators in Beirut celebrated the news of the coalition party\u2019s resignation, calling on other blocs to leave the government. In Tripoli, they let off fireworks.\n\n\u201cI am thinking maybe it\u2019s better all the government resign,\u201d said one protester, 24-year-old Ali. \u201cI am thinking maybe it\u2019s better to go to another election as people already woke up\u201d.\n\nThe army on Saturday called on protesters to \u201cexpress themselves peacefully without harming public and private property\u201d.\n\nSaturday evening, thousands were packed for a third straight night into the Riyadh al-Solh Square in central Beirut, despite security forces having used tear gas and water cannons to disperse similar crowds a day before.\n\n\u2013 \u2018We hear you\u2019 \u2013\n\nAmnesty International said the security forces\u2019 reaction was excessive, pointing out that the vast majority of protesters were peaceful.\n\n\u201cThe intention was clearly to prevent protesters gathering \u2013- in a clear violation of the right to peaceful assembly,\u201d it said.\n\nSmall groups of protesters have also damaged shop fronts and blocked roads by burning tires and other obstacles.\n\nThe Internal Security Forces said 70 arrests were made Friday on accusations of theft and arson.\n\nBut all of those held at the main police barracks were released Saturday, the National News Agency (NNA) said.\n\nThe demonstrations first erupted on Thursday, sparked by a proposed 20 US-cent tax on calls via messaging apps such as WhatsApp.\n\nSuch calls are the main method of communication for many Lebanese and, despite the government\u2019s swift abandonment of the tax, the demonstrations quickly swelled into the largest in years.\n\nPrime Minister Saad Hariri has given his deeply divided coalition until Monday evening to give back a reform package aimed at shoring up the government\u2019s finances and securing desperately needed economic assistance from donors.\n\nHe held a series of meetings Saturday regarding the situation, NNA said.\n\nHariri\u2019s political rival, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, told protesters Saturday their \u201cmessage was heard loudly\u201d.\n\nBut he warned against demanding the resignation of the government \u2014 saying it could take a long time to form a new one and solve the crisis.\n\nThe current unity government has the backing of most Lebanese political parties, including Hezbollah.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Demanding our rights\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn the southern port city of Tyre, supporters of Shia politician and speaker of parliament Nabih Berri attacked protesters Saturday, a witness said, a day after demonstrators had accused him of corruption.\n\nHis Amal political party condemned the attack and called for an investigation.\n\nMore than a quarter of the Lebanese population lives below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.\n\nMany of the country\u2019s senior politicians came to prominence during the country\u2019s 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990.\n\nThe promised austerity moves are essential if Lebanon is to unlock $11 billion in economic assistance pledged by international donors last year.\n\nGrowth has plummeted in recent years, with political deadlock compounded by the impact of eight years of war in neighbouring Syria.\n\nLebanon\u2019s public debt stands at around $86 billion \u2014 more than 150 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 according to the finance ministry.", "description": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013 A Lebanese Christian party quit the coalition government Saturday as tens of thousands of people took to the streets for a third day", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/e83ef1_protesters-are-demandng-sweeping-overhaul-lebanon-political-citing-grievances-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
