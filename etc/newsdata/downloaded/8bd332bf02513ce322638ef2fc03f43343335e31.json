Furthermore, Ankara recognises the SDF-affiliated People's Protection Units (YPG) and the Kurdistan Worker's party \u2014 both Kurdish groups \u2014 to be terrorist organisations.\n\nThe Arab League joined the condemnation of Turkey on Saturday after gathering for an emergency meeting called by Egypt. The body's Secretary-General, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, called Ankara's offensive an \"invasion of an Arab state's land and aggression of its sovereignty\".\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday that President Donald Trump had authorised US officials to draft \"very significant\" new sanctions to target Turkey after it launched its military operation, adding that banks were being notified.\n\nEU member states including France, Germany and the UK have also condemned the military offensive but Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that the country \"will not stop it no matter what anyone says\".\n\nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry also warned that it would retaliate against any sanctions.\n\n\"Turkey is fighting with terrorist organisations that create a threat to its national security,\" it said in a statement. \"No one should doubt that we will retaliate ... to any step that will be taken against this.\"\n\nAmong the West's key concern is the fate of 12,000 fighters of the so-called Islamic State (IS) detained by Kurdish authorities in prisons and camps.
