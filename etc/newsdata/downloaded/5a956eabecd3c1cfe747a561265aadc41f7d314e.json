Please fill up my coal scuttle\u201d.\u2019\n\nThis command was not unusual given that Eton lacked central heating at the time, so rooms were warmed by open fires. Aitken\u2019s extraordinary career has embraced stints as war correspondent and biographer of disgraced U.S. President Richard Nixon.\n\nKnown as \u2018Jono\u2019 by fellow inmates during his time inside, Aitken\u2019s comparatively brief imprisonment was long enough, he subsequently reflected, to discover that \u2018cells can be great places to pray\u2019.\n\nOn his release, he returned to Oxford,where he read law decades earlier, to take a degree in theology at Wycliffe Hall.\n\nAitken celebrated his ordination last year by holding a party in the Grand Hall of the Old Bailey and invited friends from the full spectrum of society \u2014 from fellow Old Etonians and parliamentarians to \u2018blaggers\u2019 (armed robbers) and \u2018blowers\u2019 (safe-crackers).\n\nDownton Abbey actor Hugh Bonneville, who plays the Earl of Grantham in the costume drama, is delighted with his new real-life role as the Deputy Lieutenant of West Sussex. \u2018It\u2019s nice because it\u2019s in my county where I live and I do quite a lot of stuff like visiting schools and reading a lot of Paddington,\u2019 he tells me. \u2018It\u2019s really the same thing, but just with a badge. I\u2019m very honoured.\u2019\n\nPierce, 66, still licensed to thrill!\n\nPierce Brosnan proves he can still get pulses racing, writes SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE\n\nIt's not quite brawny blond Daniel Craig emerging from the ocean in blue shorts \u2014 as he did in Casino Royale \u2014 but the star\u2019s predecessor as 007, Pierce Brosnan, proves he can still get pulses racing.\n\nThe silver fox, who at 66 is 15 years Craig\u2019s senior, took a dip in a lagoon in Reykjavik yesterday wearing black trunks. He has been on holiday in Iceland this week with his wife, film producer Keely, who shared this picture online.\n\n\u2018Happy times,\u2019 she captioned it. \u2018A beautiful man,\u2019 growled one female admirer.\n\nBeing a dame can make life complicated, according to the best-selling children\u2019s writer Jacqueline Wilson. \u2018I\u2019m proud to have been granted the honour but when I travel abroad a lot of people assume it\u2019s my first name and say: \u201cHi Dame!\u201d when they meet me,\u2019 laughs the author. \u2018It always amuses me.\u2019\n\nStrictly star Ore\u2019s wife reveals a love secret\n\nIt was where the romance started for Strictly winner Ore Oduba, as he hosted the National Lottery Awards with wife Portia\n\nMEMORY LANE: It was where the romance started for Strictly winner Ore Oduba, as he hosted the National Lottery Awards with wife Portia. \u2018It\u2019s really surreal being back, as this is where me and Ore met,\u2019 she gushes at the former BBC Television Centre in West London.\n\nSINGLE LIFE: Lewis star Laurence Fox, ex-husband of actress Billie Piper, has given up on finding a girlfriend. He tells me: \u2018I\u2019m not a fan of the dating apps any more, I\u2019ve deleted them. I\u2019m a solid single chap and it\u2019s a very good life. I don\u2019t feel lonely at all.\u2019\n\nSANGUINE: Anneka Rice the second contestant booted off Strictly this year, remains positive. \u2018I\u2019m a changed woman. I bought four dresses alone this week. The feminisation of me. I\u2019ve always been a bloke, even with three sons.\u2019\n\nPink Floyd founder Roger Waters gives today\u2019s young musicians short shrift for being self-obsessed and money-minded. \u2018I don\u2019t listen to today\u2019s popular music, but it seems to me from what I have listened to, the main drift for most of the people that call themselves artists is completely narcissistic and consumer-orientated,\u2019 declares the 76-year-old, who is worth \u00a3190 million. \u2018They don\u2019t touch any real part of their capacity to feel love or joy. That\u2019s how it seems. And I am surprised by that.\n\n\u2018As for my contemporaries, I am monumentally surprised how scared my fellow musicians are to stick their heads out.\u2019\n\nWhy Caprice got her skates on for Dancing On Ice\n\nModel Caprice Bourret could not resist the invitation to appear in next year\u2019s TV show Dancing On Ice\n\nModel Caprice Bourret could not resist the invitation to appear in next year\u2019s TV show Dancing On Ice.\n\n\u2018When they first asked me I was like, yes, because I\u2019ve been out so long looking after my kids,\u2019 Bourret, who has two children with financier Ty Comfort, tells me.\n\nCaprice, 47, who runs her own fashion and homewares label, most recently appeared on TV on Channel 5\u2019s Celebs On A Farm. She adds: \u2018Dancing On Ice is one of the biggest shows on TV. I would be a schmuck if I said no.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not like I\u2019m eating kangaroo balls. It\u2019s elegant and beautiful and suitable for someone like me.\u2019\n\nFancy brightening up the Queen\u2019s palaces? Her Majesty is advertising for an assistant florist.
