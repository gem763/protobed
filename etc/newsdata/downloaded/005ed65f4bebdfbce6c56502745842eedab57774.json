Gone. Poof. They\u2019re history. He\u2019s president now and liberals can\u2019t really do much about it. The Trump administration is about to infuriate the Left again as he makes tweaks to the Obama-era regulations to the Clean Water Act (via CBS News):\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency is expected to announce Thursday that it has finalized a repeal of the Obama-era clean water rule that spells out protections for large and small bodies of water, according to two congressional aides familiar with the plans.\n\nThe EPA will then write a new rule to replace the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) regulation, which was established in 2015. The Trump administration rule is expected to cover fewer waterways than the current one and weaken existing protections.\n\nSoon after he was inaugurated, President Trump signed an executive order directing the EPA and the Army to \"review and rescind or revise\" the regulation. The order said that it's in the nation's interest to keep waterways free of pollution, while still promoting economic growth and cutting regulatory uncertainty.\n\nMany businesses have opposed the WOTUS rule, arguing that it was overly broad. The National Federation of Independent Business sued the Obama administration over the rule, complaining that it gave the federal government \"jurisdiction over seasonal streams, ponds, ditches, and even depressions fields that are dry through most of the year.\" The federation also took issue with the fact that business owners could be fined $50,000 per day for violating the rule.", "description": ".09/12/2019 19:40:17PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/233/738b745a-0d41-4a2e-92a8-15d2d9bb692f.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
