The ban on corporate donations would also apply to national party conventions and to presidential inaugural activities. Individual donations to those events would be capped at $500.\n\nSanders has long been a proponent of getting company influence out of politics, and the new plan would play to his strengths.\n\nHis campaign announced last week that he raised $25.3 million in the third quarter, the highest among Democratic contenders. The haul came exclusively from individual donations averaging $18.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, his closest rival for the progressive mantle in the race, also eschews corporate money, but other contenders, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, have relied in part on donations from corporate political action committees.\n\nBillionaires Unneeded\n\n\u201cOur grassroots-funded campaign is proving every single day that you don\u2019t need billionaires and private fundraisers to run for president,\u201d Sanders said in a statement released on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve received more contributions from more individual contributors than any campaign in the history of American politics because we understand the basic reality that you can\u2019t take on a corrupt system if you take its money.\u201d\n\nIn the 2016 election, 17 company donors provided three-quarters of the funding for the Democratic National Convention, including Bank of America Corp., Comcast Corp., and Facebook Inc., the Sanders campaign pointed out. At the 2013 presidential inauguration, Chevron Corp., AT&T Inc. and Microsoft Corp. also gave millions of dollars to fund festivities at the start of President Barack Obama\u2019s second term.\n\nSanders\u2019s position puts him at odds with the Republican Party, as well as some of his key 2020 Democratic competitors. Leading GOP figures such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have long argued that corporate giving is a form of free speech, and shouldn\u2019t be regulated.\n\nCitizens United\n\nThat position was affirmed by the Citizens United Supreme Court decision in 2010, which prohibits the government from restricting independent spending by corporations and labor unions in federal elections. Sanders said he wants a constitutional amendment that jettisons Citizens United.McConnell has repeatedly taken aim at Sanders, mocking him as a socialist. The latest proposal will likely provide additional fodder to the GOP as the 2020 election intensifies.\n\nIn Sanders\u2019s plan, the senator also proposes a ban on advertising during presidential primary debates and would establish a life-time lobbying ban for former members of Congress and senior congressional aides.\n\nSanders\u2019 third-quarter fundraising haul was followed by Warren, who raised $24.6 million, and Buttigieg, who raised $19.1 million. Biden raised just $15.2 million and Senator Kamala Harris of California raised $11.6 million.\n\nLagging in Polls\n\nThe Democrats were far surpassed by Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, which, along with the Republican National Committee, took in $125 million in the third quarter. It wasn\u2019t clear how much of that came from individual donations.\n\nDespite his fundraising prowess, Sanders, 78, is now regularly lagging both Biden and Warren in national polls of Democratic primary voters after holding the second-place position behind Biden for much of this year.\n\nA Sept. 23-29 survey by Monmouth University found Warren had 28% support among Democratic voters, statistically tied with Biden, who had 25%. Sanders had 15%, while Buttigieg and Harris each had 5%. The poll of 434 Democratic or leaning Democratic voters had a margin of error of 4.7 percentage points.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Laura Litvan in Washington at llitvan@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Wendy Benjaminson at wbenjaminson@bloomberg.net, Max Berley, Ros Krasny\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Bernie Sanders unveiled a plan to end all corporate giving in federal elections, as he leads all other 2020 Democratic presidential contenders in fundraising by amassing small, individual donations.Sanders, who\u2019s recovering in Vermont after a heart attack last week, is proposing an election-financing", "authors": ["Laura Litvan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pyTDmSLhTc1ArY6WX2DqHw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/c7a41db5d413c09d6e8d908f95be5980", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
