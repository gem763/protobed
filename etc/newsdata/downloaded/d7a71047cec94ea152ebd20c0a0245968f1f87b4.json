The high-level talks are expected to take place sometime in October, but Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen, isn\u2019t holding out any great hope.\n\n\u201cI think we both need each other desperately,\u201d Doll said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think either is hurting enough to come crawling on their hands and knees and is like, can we please talk.\u201d\n\nDoll says the two sides are still \u201cmiles apart\u201d on the really important issues including the theft of U.S. intellectual property and access to China\u2019s capital markets.\n\n\u201cI think everybody\u2019s losing the trade war,\u201d Doll said. \u201cYou don\u2019t solve in a few months a problem that\u2019s taken decades to transpire.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s to blame?\n\nSome market watchers blame the nearly two-year-old trade war on China\u2019s reluctance to make a deal ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nDavid Nelson, chief strategist at Belpointe Management, is not in that camp. He says Wall Street and Main Street should brace for what could be a protracted trade dispute, that may not end with a change in leadership at the White House.\n\n\u201cThis next election may actually end up being a referendum on just who\u2019s the toughest out there and who can go up against [China],\u201d Nelson said.\n\nHe points out that Senators Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren are among the Democratic lawmakers talking tough on China.\n\n\u201cWe can debate the tactics used and whether or not this is the right policy to deal with this situation, but what isn\u2019t up for debate is the fact that it has to be done, and if it isn\u2019t Trump, who\u2019s going to do it? Somebody on the other side of the aisle is, because Americans finally get it, the polls show that,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than two-thirds of American voters want the U.S. to confront Beijing over its trade policies, even though 74% say that American consumers are carrying most of the burden of the tariffs, according to a Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll survey.\n\nAll about profits\n\nWhile the U.S. trade war with China may dictate the intra-day swings of global stock markets, Doll said the most important thing for investors remains the health of corporate profits.\n\nLooking out the next 18 months, Doll thinks earnings expectations are still too high.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m most worried about next year,\u201d he said. \u201cConsensus is still up 10 and a fraction. My guess is it\u2019s going to be about half that.\u201d\n\nAlexis Christoforous is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d Follow her on Twitter @AlexisTVNews.", "description": "The U.S. is about to enter its 14th round of trade talks with China.
