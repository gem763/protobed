She came home and we were all in the house.\n\n\"We heard a row in the front garden. There was no real shouting or screaming, but there was an argument going on.\n\n\"Then he stabbed her. And she bled internally to death during the night.\"\n\nHis mother died on August 1 in hospital as a result of her injuries.\n\n(Image: Birmingham Mail)\n\nJimmy handed himself in and was arrested by the police.\n\nAfter a court trial he received a four year sentence of which he served 18 months before being released for \"good behaviour\".\n\nChris said: \"Back then it was called crime through passion. To me, he had murdered her.\n\n\"He stabbed her on the garden at my grandmother's house.\"\n\nDuring the trial and his father's prison sentence, Chris was passed around family members before later entering the care system and being adopted just a few years later.\n\nAlthough he was advised not to return to the area, Chris' father did and he and his brother were sent back to live with their father.\n\nChris said: \"Those two years were probably the scariest time of my life. At five years old I would defy anyone to have any childhood memories, but I can honestly say after that age my memories are sharp. I can remember everything.\n\n\"Being sent back to live with him at seven years old until the age of around eight and a half, nine years old, was awful.\n\n(Image: Birmingham Mail)\n\n\"It was neglect and abuse of the highest level. It was constant. We were totally ignored.\n\n\"Over the weekends we wouldn't see either of them.\"\n\nWith his father and his new wife rarely feeding them, Chris relied on school dinners, the generosity of neighbours or shoplifting to survive.\n\nBut just a couple of years later Chris's father was back in prison - for almost beating his second wife Dianne to death in the family home.\n\nChris said: \"Out of everything that happened I'm at peace with it, but this one is the one that still rests uneasy with me.\n\n\"Me and my brother, that night we were in the house.\n\n\"There was shouting and banging and screaming. And that was it.\n\n\"We both got up in the morning and he put us on the settee and gave us a blanket and said he was going out, to look for Dianne.\n\n(Image: Birmingham Mail)\n\n\"But something had happened during the night. All the downstairs electrics were off. It was dark.\n\n\"I went upstairs into their bedroom because there was light - but it was like an Alfred Hitchcock film.\n\n\"The lamp was on the floor, there was blood absolutely everywhere. It still gets to me. I thought he'd killed her. I knew he'd done it before, I thought he'd killed her and was getting rid of her.\n\n\"The first fear of mine was that we were next, because he'd locked us in and we couldn't get out.\n\n\"There was blood, glass, beer bottles, the bedding was everywhere the lamp was on the floor.\n\n\"I could only describe it as like an Alfred Hitchcock or Agatha Christie murder scene.\"\n\nJimmy was once again sent to prison for 18 months, and Chris was later adopted.\n\nChris said: \"They talk about the system letting you down. But there wasn't a system in place for our sort of situation then.\n\n(Image: Birmingham Mail)\n\n\"They let us be dispersed amongst her members of family and some of us went to his members of family. And we were all brought up to mistrust and despise each other.\"\n\nAfter trying to join the army, but being turned away as he was a few months shy of turning 16, Chris ended up working 40 hours a week on a farm for little money.\n\n\"The only alternative for me was to turn back to the people I grew up with in the care system, who were doing more nefarious drug dealing.\n\n\"It's funny, with all this about county lines and kids transporting drugs all over the place, it's nothing new.\n\n\"I recall a time carrying eight ounces of amphetamines on a bus to Cardiff with the actual drug dealer sat behind me four seats back.\n\n\"We'd get off at Cardiff bus station and he'd take the drugs off me and you'd get paid in drugs.\n\n\"You'd get some and bag it up into little envelopes yourself and that's how you would make money. I was 15/16.\"\n\nChris continued along this lifestyle until he realised he was on a downward spiral.\n\nHe said: \"I was using too. I was taking speed, cocaine was very rare back in them days but cocaine, if it came along. Then it was get out and leave.\"\n\nChris later ended up working in a foundry after being given a chance by an Irish man he met, and turned away from drugs.\n\nAfter describing a long process of making peace with his childhood, Chris is now married to his second wife, is a dad and works for Jaguar-Land Rover in Birmingham.\n\nJimmy died in 2011, aged 75.\n\nChris said: \"He died a bitter and twisted man. He spent his last days in a pensioner's flat three doors away from where he killed his wife. He never felt remorse.\"\n\nChris has now released a book based on his experiences, titled 'A Dish Best Served Cold?'.\n\nThe dad-of-two said: \"Of course you move forward, but these things are always with you. They\u2019re part of who you are. The fear of being hungry that I had from childhood has stayed with me all my life. To this day, if I\u2019m hungry and I don\u2019t have something to eat, I get in a panic.\n\n\"As I grew older I began to wonder if there was something I could do to excise the ghosts. That was the start of writing my novel.\"\n\nA Dish Best Served Cold, by Chris Kinsey, is released on October 31 by Candy Jar Books .", "description": "Chris Kinsey was starved and neglected by Fredrick Charles Bamsey who served just 18 months for stabbing to death his mum Wendy in the 1970s", "authors": ["Thomas Deacon", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Birmingham Mail"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20735172.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_NWP_BEM_251019Book_01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
