We had a great performance, but we\u2019ve got to be more focussed, because this has happened too many times now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEveryone has to be more concentrated. A side like ours cannot keep conceding this many goals from set plays.\u201d\n\nSavic\u2019s scrappy goal galvanised Atletico and moments later Spain forward Vitolo forced Juve keeper Wojciech Szczesny to make an acrobatic save.\n\nAtletico were denied a penalty when the ball hit the arm of Bonucci, with Diego Costa earning a yellow card for his loud protests at the decision.\n\nINSTANT HERO\n\nSubstitute Herrera made himself an instant hero 14 minutes into his competitive debut for the club by escaping his marker and heading home Kieran Trippier\u2019s corner to spark jubilant scenes in the stands and around the Atletico dugout.\n\n\u201cThis team is renowned for suffering and fighting until the end. This result tastes better than most draws, of course we wanted to win but a draw is good given how tough Juventus are,\u201d said Herrera, who joined Atleti from Porto in the close season.\n\n\u201cA draw isn\u2019t bad at all given the team we were up against and we were better than them in many moments of the game. I\u2019m so happy to have made my debut and to help the team.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nJuve forward Cristiano Ronaldo had an unusually quiet game after scoring a hat-trick against Atletico in last year\u2019s competition, although he came within inches of grabbing a last-gasp winner when he sent a shot just past the far post.\n\nVisiting coach Maurizio Sarri was left with a bittersweet feeling in his first Champions League match in charge of Juve.\n\n\u201cI feel good about the character we showed, the performance we gave and the two goals, but I feel a sense of anger because we had the game under control and we let it slip,\u201d he said.", "description": "Atletico Madrid produced a typically spirited comeback from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Juventus in a thrilling finale to Wednesday's heavyweight Champions League Group D opener.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431379086&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1ZM", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
