Pictures taken and shared via social media of the apparent impromptu screening showed a crowd gathered around watching.\n\n\"Tonight in Sham Shui Po, \u2066@SouthPark\u2069 episode \u2018Band in China\u2019 shown on street to large & appreciative audience.

The Hong Kong protests have been organized in a deliberately leaderless and anonymous way, to protect participants from the government's aggressive suppression.\n\nThe screening inspired considerable discussion on the online forums favored by the protest movement though. Many praised South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone as \u201cprophets,\u201d and rare Western media figures willing to show \"strong backbone\" in response to the Chinese government's efforts to stifle international free speech.\n\nOthers also noted that the screening was valuable because it provided a chance for older community members who don't typically watch Western entertainment to get a sense of how some powerful voices overseas are supporting Hong Kong's cause, although many others have bowed to Beijing's business threats.\n\nSouth Park made headlines around the world this week when The Hollywood Reporter reported that the show was banned in China and all mentions of the cartoon were scrubbed from the Chinese internet and streaming services.\n\nThe move came swiftly after the episode, which criticized both the country, and the entertainment industry for shaping art to bend to Chinese censors.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, show creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone issued a statement with a faux apology about the ban that mentioned the NBA, which has also been ensnared in Chinese controversy.\n\n\"Like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,\" the statement reads. \"We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn't look like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the great Communist Party of China. May the autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful. We good now China?\"\n\nThe NBA has been criticized for its response to China penalizing the league over comments about the Hong Kong protesters, whereas Parker and Stone have been celebrated both for the episode, but also their blunt, unapologetic rebuttal.\n\nThe incident particularly resonated with the people of Hong Kong because of its direct takedown of the tactics Chinese government uses to silence dissenting voices, a playbook that has been repeated rolled out in Hong Kong. Major companies in the city, including its flagship airline Cathay Pacific and the MTR Corporation, which runs the territory's vital subway and rail system, have succumbed to business pressures from Beijing by firing staff members who voiced support for the protests.\n\n\u201cI am laughing with tears in my eyes,\u201d one anonymous user wrote on a protester forum in response to the episode.\n\nSouth Park celebrated its milestone 300th episode Wednesday night, and true to form, doubled-down on the controversy. One of subplots of the the new episode, titled \"SHOTS!!!,\" revolved around the phrase, \"Fuck the Chinese government.\"", "description": "The notorious episode of 'South Park' which just got the show banned in China was screened on the streets of Hong Kong on Tuesday evening.", "authors": ["Ryan Parker Karen Chu", "Ryan Parker", "Karen Chu", "Ryan.Parker Thr.Com", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "top_image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2019/10/screen_shot_2019-10-02_at_7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
