At this point, she added, \u201cit sort of has a life of its own.\u201d (Indeed, as the Vice story noted, some therapists even impart the idea of love languages to their couples-therapy clients without having read the book: One therapist told the author she knew enough to know it was \u201ca vehicle for people to communicate about yourself to someone else. It\u2019s a way to ask for what you need.\u201d)\n\nBut people who become familiar with the concept without reading the book often think, Todd noted, that people should simply express love in the way that feels natural to them and then explain to their partners that that\u2019s their love language\u2014or that the point is to know your own love language solely for the purpose of telling your partner what you want. Certainly, Todd emphasized, it\u2019s good to know your own love language, and it\u2019s healthy to communicate to your partner what makes you feel appreciated and what doesn\u2019t do much for you. But Chapman\u2019s advice, she pointed out, doesn\u2019t stop there so much as it starts there.\n\nIf you sit down and read Chapman\u2019s book, it\u2019s clear that the love language you\u2019re meant to think about isn\u2019t your own, but your partner\u2019s. The first chapter concludes by hammering home that the pathway to a more fulfilling relationship is to tailor your own expressions of love to what makes your partner feel loved: \u201cWe cannot rely on our native tongue if our spouse does not understand it,\u201d Chapman writes. \u201cIf we want them to feel the love we are trying to communicate, we must express it in their primary love language.\u201d\n\nChapman then devotes five chapters to identifying each of the love languages in a partner, just one to identifying your own love language, and the better part of six chapters\u2014essentially the rest of the book\u2014to specific strategies for adapting your behavior to your partner\u2019s love language. In other words, what often gets lost in the discourse is that The Five Love Languages encourages attentiveness and behavioral self-regulation above all else.\n\nWhich, if you ask some relationship researchers, is a shame\u2014because that\u2019s the part that holds the most promise.\n\nWhen the love-languages concept entered the cultural lexicon, it soon attracted the interest of a handful of relationship and marriage researchers who wanted to test Chapman\u2019s claims as scientific hypotheses. Their findings have been mixed, but some researchers have found its attentiveness-plus-behavioral-change formula worthwhile. One study determined, for instance, that Chapman\u2019s advice was likely to produce certain established \u201crelational maintenance\u201d behaviors that research had previously linked to higher rates of love, satisfaction, commitment, and equity in relationships. So in theory, it was certainly possible that a couple who applied the principles of The Five Love Languages to their day-to-day lives could end up with higher levels of relationship satisfaction. Another study found that love-language alignment (or two halves of a couple identifying as having the same love language) was a somewhat weak predictor of relationship satisfaction, especially when compared with self-regulating one\u2019s behavior according to a partner\u2019s wants and needs.", "description": "A framework meant to help people become more attuned to their partners now gets treated like a personality test.", "authors": ["Ashley Fetters"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_1124670410/facebook.jpg?1571347203", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
