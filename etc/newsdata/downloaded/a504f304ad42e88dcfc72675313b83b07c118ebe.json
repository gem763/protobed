It reports that the company effectively bought accusers\u2019 silence by tying nondisclosure agreements to their financial settlements. And it alleges that top NBC brass impeded Farrow\u2019s reporting on Weinstein.\n\nThe book has sparked new tensions within NBC, which claims it has nothing to hide, and raised more questions around how President Donald Trump\u2019s media allies may have covered for his inappropriate behavior.\n\nHere\u2019s what else you might have missed:\n\nThe National Enquirer shredded Trump documents\n\nEnquirer owner American Media Inc. has been at the center of cover-ups of Trump\u2019s alleged affairs. The company admitted last year that it paid hush money to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and federal prosecutors said it played a key role in helping Trump fixer Michael Cohen broker a similar deal to silence porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nBut Farrow reports that the company also kept a trove of documents of Trump dirt stretching back decades in a safe. The book says that Dylan Howard, then editor of The National Enquirer, ordered a staffer to destroy the files on the eve of the 2016 election, the same day the Wall Street Journal came calling with questions about McDougal\u2019s payout.\n\nREAD: Matt Lauer's accuser reportedly told the anchor 'no' multiple times\n\n\u201cThe staffer opened the safe, removed a set of documents, and tried to wrest it shut,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cLater, reporters would discuss the safe like it was the warehouse where they stored the Ark of the Covenant in 'Indiana Jones,' but it was small and cheap and old.\u201d\n\nAmerican Media representatives called the reporting \u201ccompletely untrue\u201d in a statement to Politico. But Farrow also quotes former National Enquirer staffer Jerry George saying that the publication \u201ckilled perhaps 10 fully reported stories about Trump, and nixed many more potential leads\u201d during his 28-year career there.\n\nLauer exposed himself to a woman at work\n\nIn 2010, Farrow reports, the \"Today\" show anchor asked then-producer Melissa Lonner in to his office during a party at NBC headquarters in Rockefeller Center. While Lonner didn\u2019t speak to Farrow about the encounter, she did confide in coworkers, including Lauer\u2019s co-anchor Ann Curry, who did.\n\nThose sources told Farrow that Lonner and Lauer sat down on a couch in his office, where he joked about disliking work cocktail parties and then \u201cunzipped his pants and exposed his erect penis.\u201d\n\nREAD: NBC made Matt Lauer's accuser sign a super-restrictive NDA\n\nLonner nervously laughed, Farrow writes, telling Lauer that she didn\u2019t want to be in a room with him \u201cwhere everyone else has done it.\u201d He reportedly replied that \u201che knew that she wanted it.\u201d\n\nAs Lonner attempted to leave, Farrow writes, Lauer reportedly grew agitated. \u201cMelissa, you\u2019re a f\u2013king tease,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not good. You led me on.\u201d\n\nNBC News bosses have denied that Curry or other employees ever notified them of the alleged harassment. Lauer\u2019s camp pushed back on the allegation to Farrow, saying only that he made a lewd joke.\n\nFarrow\u2019s former NBC colleague backs him up\n\nRich McHugh, who worked with Farrow when he was initially reporting on the Weinstein allegations, claims that top NBC News officials continuously slow-walked the investigation. In a detailed account for Vanity Fair, McHugh takes aim at NBC News Chairman And Lack and President Noah Oppenheim for killing a Pulitzer Prize-winning expose that Farrow eventually published in The New Yorker.\n\n\u201cThey not only personally intervened to shut down our investigation of Weinstein, they even refused to allow me to follow up on our work after Weinstein\u2019s history of sexual assault became front-page news,\u201d writes McHugh, who resigned from NBC last year. \u201cAs the record shows, they behaved more like members of Weinstein\u2019s PR team than the journalists they claim to be.\u201d\n\nNBC is punching back hard\n\nThe media company unleashed an aggressive PR campaign to preempt the book, with top officials reportedly visiting several outside newsrooms to argue Farrow\u2019s reporting is flawed.\n\nIn a memo to staff shared with VICE News, Lack said that Farrow \u201cuses a variety of tactics to paint a fundamentally untrue picture\u201d of NBC. He called the book\u2019s suggestion that the company covered up Lauer\u2019s behavior before 2017 \u201cabsolutely false and offensive.\u201d\n\nOppenheim echoed that pushback in a similar memo obtained by The New York Times Monday, calling the claims that NBC covered for powerful men a \u201csmear\u201d and \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d\n\n\u201cFarrow\u2019s effort to defame NBC News is clearly motivated not by a pursuit of truth, but an ax to grind,\u201d Oppenheim wrote. \u201cIt is built on a series of distortions, confused timelines and outright inaccuracies.\u201d\n\nCover: Matt Lauer on Thursday Nov.16, 2017 -- (Photo by: Zach Pagano/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images)", "description": "Matt Lauer exposed himself to a colleague at NBC, according to the newly released \"Catch and Kill.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da5f6089ba232000aa3b94d/lede/1571157918746-Matt-Lauer.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.84375xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
