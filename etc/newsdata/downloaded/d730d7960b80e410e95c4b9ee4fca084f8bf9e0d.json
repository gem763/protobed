Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attacks, which have cut Saudi oil output roughly in half.\n\nPompeo said Iran was behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while leaders in Tehran \"pretend to engage in diplomacy.\"\n\nSunni Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite-led Iran back opposing factions across the Middle East, from Yemen and Syria to Lebanon and Iraq. Saudi Arabia is leading a military coalition to back Yemen's internationally recognized government against the Houthis.\n\nWashington, a staunch ally of Riyadh, has adopted a tough anti-Iran \"maximum pressure\" policy to force Tehran to negotiate a broader deal that further curbs its nuclear program, restricts Tehran's ballistic missile work and ends its support for regional proxy forces.\n\nConway said the U.S. Energy Department is prepared to tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve after the attacks on Saudi oil facilities if needed to stabilize the global energy supply.\n\n\"We have energy under our feet and off our shores, and this president is leading the way to responsibly develop it so that when Iran attacks Saudi Arabia over 100 times, we are prepared to take action to protect our own interests,\" she said.
