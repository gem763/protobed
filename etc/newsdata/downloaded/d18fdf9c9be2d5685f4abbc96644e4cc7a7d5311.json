They said they have \"concerns about foreign assistance in the 2016 election that have not been thoroughly addressed.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTheir letter comes as Trump faces an impeachment inquiry from the House amid revelations that he sought help from Ukraine's president to probe former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic nomination.

Ukrainian efforts, abetted by a U.S. political party, to interfere in the 2016 election should not be ignored,\" the two senators wrote in a letter dated Sept. 27. \"Are you investigating links and coordination between the Ukrainian government and individuals associated with the campaign of Hillary Clinton or the Democratic National Committee?

Do tell the public about your close relationship with Manafort. How about your advisor Barbara Ledeen mentioned in the Mueller report, Flynn\u2019s good friend?\"\n\nLedeen, a Senate Judiciary Committee aide, was referenced in the Mueller report about her efforts to find Hillary Clinton's emails.\n\nThe two asked for a response by Oct. 14, requesting that unclassified material be sent to the committee and classified material kept separate from documents that could be otherwise be made publicly available.", "description": "Johnson (R-Wis.) and Grassley (R-Iowa) pressed the Justice Department to probe any connection between Clinton and Ukrainian operatives.", "authors": ["Burgess Everett"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8a/f6/d11ad49d4985b52ff227df426155/190930-grassley-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
