I was expecting to be unimpressed with its small keyboard. We\u2019ve seen this story before, after all: first with netbooks and then with the original low-end Surfaces. You usually get something that promises to offer something like what you\u2019re used to on a full-power device, but end up frustrated and annoyed.\n\nWhat I wasn\u2019t expecting was that the Surface Go would be such a joy to use \u2014 the only caveat being that I\u2019m using the more expensive model that costs $680 with a keyboard. If you stay within its limits, the Surface Go is perhaps the most delightful computer Microsoft has ever shipped. You just have to know what to expect before you buy it.\n\nOur review of Microsoft Surface Go Verge Score 8.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Ultra portable\n\nGreat keyboard\n\nGood battery life Bad Stuff Big bezels mean screen is cramped\n\nDongles\n\nUpgraded model is pricey Buy for $549.00 from Microsoft Buy for $549.00 from Amazon\n\nThe Surface Go is a 10-inch hybrid tablet-laptop Windows computer. It\u2019s just really small, honestly. That seems like an obvious point to make, but it\u2019s the essence of what the Surface Go is: A very tiny Surface. I said in my last video that I have a soft spot for tiny computers. They\u2019re just a little more convenient to carry around and the tradeoffs in performance are usually worth it for me. The sign of a good tiny computer is that you have to check to make sure it\u2019s actually in your bag when you leave the house. And I have had to check several times \u2014 it weighs 1.15 pounds on its own.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise is typing on the slightly-less-than-full-size keyboard. I found it only took me a few hours to get used to it, and I\u2019ve been able to jam along without more typos that usual. It uses traditional scissor switches, which means that there\u2019s good key travel. The keys themselves are slightly domed, which might help just a little with accuracy. The glass Precision trackpad is similarly good \u2014 just big enough so that you don\u2019t feel cramped using it.\n\nThe hardware build quality is really nice. It has a full-range hinge on the kickstand that works at pretty much any angle. The body is made out of magnesium with slightly more rounded edges than other Surface computers. One downside is that the bezels around the 1800 x 1200 touchscreen are just huge. Really big, and it makes the machine feel super cramped. Beyond making it easier to hold in tablet mode, I suspect those bezels exist to make room for the webcam and magnetic keyboard connector. Whatever the reason, they make an otherwise premium machine feel a little frumpy.\n\nI have mixed feelings about the port situation. I\u2019m glad there\u2019s microSD for storage expansion and I\u2019m glad there\u2019s a USB-C port. You can charge over it, but you will also likely need to get some dongles. It comes with a magnetically attaching Surface Connector, but unfortunately the charging brick doesn\u2019t have a USB-A port (the larger Surface Pro charger does). Another downside: iFixit points out that this computer is basically unrepairable if something goes wrong. So getting Microsoft\u2019s extended warranty isn\u2019t the worst idea.\n\nSurface Go pricing 4GB RAM, 64GB eMMC, Wi-Fi: $399\n\n8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, Wi-Fi: $549 Accessories Surface Go Type Cover (black): $99\n\nSurface Go Signature Type Cover (Alcantara, red, blue, or silver): $129\n\nSurface Mobile Mouse: $34.99\n\nSurface Pen: $99\n\nI\u2019ve been getting about six hours of active use on the battery, which is fairly decent. Microsoft rates battery life by just running a video loop, which it claims will get you nine hours. I\u2019ve been impressed with how quickly the Surface Go charges both on its Surface Connector charger and on high-powered USB-C chargers.\n\nTo get to something this small, Microsoft had to make a few changes to what you think of as a standard Windows computer. The first and most important is the processor, an Intel Pentium Gold 4415Y chip. Normally, when we talk about low-end processors for tiny computers, we\u2019re talking about Atom chips back in the day or Intel\u2019s Core m3 line. This chip is something a little different and, yes, much better than I expected.\n\nThe Surface Go isn\u2019t exactly fast, but I\u2019ve had no issues with slowdowns doing my day-to-day computer stuff. All the basics of browsing in Edge, Word, Spotify, Outlook for email, and so on, were fast enough for me. Chrome did manage to bog down a little, but that\u2019s not a huge surprise.\n\nEven though I was pleasantly surprised by the power of this chip, let\u2019s not get carried away. This is very much not a gaming machine, not even a little. But I still was a little sad to see even a Microsoft exclusive like Ori and the Blind Forest felt a little laggy. I also installed Steam and tried Transistor, which ran better.\n\nWe also put it through some workflows with Adobe Lightroom CC Classic. For light photo editing, it works in a pinch. But heavier work like stitching panoramas together or batch processing lots of photos really made it chug. Honestly, the bigger issue with editing photos was the smaller screen. You find yourself leaning in way closer than is comfortable.\n\nPart of the reason my performance was so good is that I have the upgraded model, which bumps up the RAM and storage. All that extra RAM really helps with multitasking and makes Windows much nicer to use.\n\nThe base model costs $399 and comes with just 64GB of eMMC storage and 4GB of RAM. The updated model costs $549 and comes with 128GB of SSD storage and 8GB of RAM. On both models, you will want to buy a keyboard. There are two options there: the basic one is a hundred bucks, but I really do prefer the $130 version with Alcantara fabric.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions about the lower-end model, but unfortunately the only version I\u2019ve tested is the higher-end model. Though I haven\u2019t tried the cheaper one, I can comfortably guess that it will be a dog. There are two big reasons for that. The first is that it uses eMMC storage, which is historically much slower than SSD. The second is that it only has 4GB of RAM. You can use Windows 10 with just 4GB of RAM, but you won\u2019t want to.\n\nAll of which brings me to S Mode, the version of Windows that the Surface Go ships with. By default, it will only run apps that are available in the Windows Store. But the apps you want to run on Windows aren\u2019t in the Windows Store. For me, that means stuff like 1Password and the Amazon Kindle app (which was inexplicably pulled from the store). For you, it might mean Chrome or Firefox or some other Windows app.\n\nAs an aside: I think S Mode is one of the unsung tragedies in tech right now. Microsoft was significantly ahead of the rest of the industry in trying to find ways to bring the innovation we\u2019ve seen in mobile apps over to the desktop. Windows Store apps, at their best, do exactly that. Now Chrome OS is running Android apps and macOS is about to port iOS apps over. Microsoft had the right idea first, but having the right idea hasn\u2019t translated into having the right apps. S Mode was always meant to be a forcing function to fix that problem, and thus far it hasn\u2019t worked.\n\nTurning off S Mode is easy \u2014 it doesn\u2019t even require a reboot. And I think many people will find that One App they need and end up turning off S Mode. Which opens the floodgates to installing more power and RAM-hungry apps, which means that 4GB isn\u2019t going to be enough.\n\nThe thing I love most about Windows is that it never tells you \u201cno, you can\u2019t do that.\u201d Whether you\u2019re using a top-tier gaming laptop or a low-end device like the Surface Go, the same software is available to you. That blessing is also a curse, because you can very easily end up trying to run software that has no place on a low-end machine.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to limit yourself to just simple apps on a Surface Go, but doing so gets rid of a lot of the reasons for getting this computer. That\u2019s why I recommend the more expensive model. You\u2019ll get the benefits of a small and light computer, but you\u2019ll still be able to do more intensive tasks from time to time.\n\nIts price \u2014 $680 \u2014 is not exactly cheap and before I used this computer extensively, I thought it would put this machine in an awkward pricing range that would make it good for nobody. People who want a cheap computer would get a Chromebook or iPad, people who want a good PC for around $700 would find a full-sized laptop. Those assumptions are not entirely wrong.\n\nBut the wrong assumption I made is that the Surface Go fits into either of those categories. Instead, it\u2019s exactly what it claims to be: a small Surface. Something about using it just engenders affinity, I enjoyed using this computer every day and was continually impressed at how well it multitasked. Sure, it commands a more expensive asking price, but in return gives you a better experience.\n\nWe don\u2019t overthink the iPad Pro, which starts at over $800 with a keyboard. There\u2019s no need to overthink the Surface Go, either. It\u2019s good.", "description": "The newest Surface tablet has a 10-inch screen and starts at $399, but Dieter Bohn explains in his review why you should get the upgraded model, and why it\u2019s so impressive.", "authors": ["Dieter Bohn", "Aug", "Photography Vjeran Pavic"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bKuauQQDKy5vN-RQ5Db5VENfZ80=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11932071/vpavic_180803_2796_0088.jpg", "published_at": "2018-08-07"}
