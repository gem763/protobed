Just read it,\u201d Bolsonaro says. \u201cThere are facts, not the blah blah blah of the left.\u201d\n\nThe book he recommended was written by Col Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, who in 2008 became Brazil\u2019s first military man convicted for kidnap and torture during the dictatorship.\n\nThe Suffocated Truth \u2013 The Story the Left Doesn\u2019t Want Brazil to Know, was published a year before Ustra\u2019s death in 2015 and \u2013 according to the summary \u2013 \u201cseek(s) to dispel myths, deceptions, and lies\u201d.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Brazilian media, one Ustra victim, Gilberto Natalini, described sadistic torture sessions that had played out under the watch of the man Bolsonaro considers a role model.\n\n\u201cIt was a house of horrors,\u201d Natalini said of the torture centre where he was held by Ustra\u2019s men. \u201cOnce I saw them hang a man upside down by his feet and leave him there for almost 48 hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were terrified of Ustra because he was in charge of it all,\u201d Natalini added. \u201cHow could you ever forget a face like his? It was the face of depravity itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very sad that the president continues to defend the most cowardly crime that man can practice; the crime of torture,\u201d said Ant\u00f4nio Funari, president of the Justice and Peace Commission, a Catholic Church advocacy organization.\n\nBrazil: tortured dissidents appalled by Bolsonaro's praise for dictatorship Read more\n\nS\u00e2mia Bomfim, a S\u00e3o Paulo congresswoman with the leftwing Socialism and Liberty party tweeted: \u201cThose who encourage this monstrosity are accomplices to the suffering that plagued countless families during the dictatorship. Bolsonaro drinks from the sewers of our history.\u201d\n\nBut with the rise of Brazil\u2019s far right, Ustra has become a cult hero for some, with T-shirts bearing his face and chants of \u201cUstra lives\u201d sometimes seen at rallies and events.\n\nIn 2016, Bolsonaro, then a congress back bencher, praised Ustra in a speech during the impeachment of the president, Dilma Rousseff, who was herself a torture victim during the dictatorship.", "description": "Brazil\u2019s president accused of \u2018drinking from the sewers of history\u2019 by recommending The Suffocated Truth", "authors": ["Sam Cowie"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3c3ff27ab983432f3fb0a511dd14b35aa00dec9/0_69_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=23c2e2a4007b11d00803ead552725384", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
