Known as the country's coal capital, the district is home to eight coal-fired power plants, producing enough electricity daily to power 16 million homes.\n\nIn India, around 75% of electricity comes from coal \u2014 meaning Singrauli is crucial to the government's plans of providing power to all.\n\nAccording to the Health Effects Institute , 1.2 million deaths were caused in India in 2017 due to air pollution.\n\nRuta Kaur lives in Singrauli with her husband and three children. She says coal pollution is creating problems for her family.\n\n\"We have problems drinking water,\" she tells CNN Business. \"We have stomach complications; children are impacted too because of the coal. The coal dust gets into the house, it gets deposited on our food; there is a lot of difficulty.\"\n\nTo mitigate these problems, Singrauli coal mining company Northern Coalfields has introduced measures such as spraying water on coalfields to decrease the spread of dust, phasing out the use of trucks to ferry coal in favor of trains, and decommissioning some power stations and replacing them with newer coal plants, which they claim have lower emissions.\n\nPrabhat Kumar Sinha, chairman and managing director of Northern Coalfields, admits India is behind others in the world in moving to a cleaner energy supply. \"But we are trying our best to make it up,\" he says.\n\nSeven of the world's top 10 cities with the worst air pollution are in India. New Delhi, the country's capital, suffers from a toxic smog problem.\n\nClimate change\n\nThe harmful effects of coal go beyond air pollution. As a major emitter of CO2, it also heavily contributes to global warming.\n\nIndia is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world. It's also very vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Intense heatwaves have become the norm during the summer, with temperatures reaching over 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit) in some provinces. Last year, there were 484 heatwaves across the country, up from 21 in 2010. Since that year, more than 5,000 people have died as a result.\n\nWith India's demand for energy set to double over the next decade because of a rapidly growing economy and population, shedding its coal dependency is a monumental challenge.\n\nAmbitious plans\n\nBut the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has introduced some ambitious targets to tackle climate change and energy consumption.\n\nIndia is investing heavily in renewable energy. It has increased its solar energy capacity from less than four gigawatts in 2015 to nearly 30 gigawatts \u2014 about 8% of its total energy capability.\n\nThe government is aiming for 175 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2022, with 100 GW to come from solar power, 60 GW from wind, 10 GW from biofuels and 5 GW from hydropower.\n\n\"We are accelerating the pace of renewables in a very, very big way,\" says Amitabh Kant, CEO of National Institution for Transforming India, a government think tank.\n\n\"India's biggest strength is not in coal but in the sun,\" he adds. \"I think in the next three to four years you will realize that the acceleration towards renewables will be phenomenal.\"", "description": "India is still heavily dependent on coal, but it has ambitious plans to transition to renewables.", "authors": ["Nell Lewis", "John Defterios"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181108131603-new-delhi-pollution-nov-8-super-tease.jpg"}
