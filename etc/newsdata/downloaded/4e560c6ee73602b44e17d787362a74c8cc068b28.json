They also had to deal with fast-shifting control of cities and major motorways that were their pathway out of the country.\n\nAs of Tuesday at least one small unit of US forces, estimated to be between 50 and 100 soldiers, was trapped in place by advances from two sides: by the Turkish forces along the border, and Russian-backed Syrian regime forces, who began arriving into the formerly Kurdish controlled cities of Raqqa, Manbij, Kobani, Qamishli and Ayn Issa.\n\n\"Two [observation posts] were located in the area around Kobani and these units were cut off from the rest of Rojava by the Turkish advance on one side and the arrival of regime militias from the west into Manbij,\" said a Western military official who until recently had worked closely with the SDF.\n\n\"They will have to find a way around as the Syrians and Turkish feel each other out in these contested towns.\n\n\"So not only is the most successful international counter-terrorism operation in history finished, but the winners are Syria and Russia, who didn't even participate in the operation,\" said the official.\n\nRead more: Disaster is unfolding in Syria as videos emerge of US allies being slaughtered and hundreds of ISIS prisoners escape during airstrikes\n\nRussian and Syrian national flags flutter on military vehicles near Manbij, Syria October 15, 2019.

It's a demoralizing turnabout.\"\n\nThe official \u2014 who is under orders not to discuss the situation with the media \u2014 expressed frustration at the last week of conflicting orders from top US officials.\n\nHe described three sets of orders from senior commanders: first a total standdown, in which troops would cease operations but stay put. Second was a partial withdrawal from their bases. Finally came instructions for a near-complete departure, effectively ending the five-year mission which killed and captured tens of thousands of ISIS fighters, and cleared eastern Syria's major population centers of the group.\n\nThe source said: \"The French and UK have smaller special forces units [in Syria] than the Americans so it's not that much trouble to withdraw them safely. But the equipment and support operation that backed them and the rest of the coalition forces isn't like 20 well trained commandos you can just tell to pack up and get out.\"\n\nRead more: Trump has delivered what Russia wants in Syria\u2014at zero cost\u2014 and 'Putin likely can't believe his luck'\n\nSyrian army soldiers ride in vehicles in the town of Ain Issa, Syria, in this handout released by SANA on October 14, 2019.

They need to wind down the operations, protect and remove all their logistical equipment, and move 1,000 soldiers safely through a war zone. It's a lot to ask even the best-trained troops in such short notice, under such chaotic conditions.\"\n\nAn SDF official near the city of Manbij confirmed reports that the US garrison in the base in that city has withdrawn.\n\nIn the process it ceded control of the base to mercenaries from the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company which supports Syrian military operations.\n\nOne Russian journalist embedded with the mercenary group posted video from the base in which he said the US troops left on Monday:\n\nRead more: Trump only imposed sanctions on Turkey after advisers explained to him the obvious consequences of letting them invade Syria, report says\n\nThe SDF official confirmed its accuracy.\n\n\"The Russians are in the American base in Manbij now, they helped escort the Americans out of the area and got their base in return,\" said the SDF official. \"I think the Russians will move into all of the American bases in Syria soon.\"\n\nPentagon leadership Monday night said its primary focus was a safe withdrawal of its forces, and that it had assigned air support for each moving pocket of US troops.\n\nAs groups of US commandos gather at rally points away from the fighting, they will have air cover for a move into northern Iraq, where the US maintains multiple bases with the permission of the Iraqi government.\n\nHow long this pullout will take remains unclear. US officials recently told CNN that it could be a matter of days, or as long as several weeks.\n\nBut with Syrian and Turkish troops on an apparent collision course Tuesday, there might not be that much time for a safe departure.", "description": "The hasty withdrawal was announced Saturday by President Donald Trump, who said that all US troops in Syria would withdraw as soon as possible.", "authors": ["Mitch Prothero"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5b1b5cc4a0a1c594a4d78?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
