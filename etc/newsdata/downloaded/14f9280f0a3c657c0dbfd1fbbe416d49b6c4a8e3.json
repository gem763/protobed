Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, he said, was a \u201cvengeful man, unpredictable and petty-minded.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur society is still sick,\u201d Mr. Bukovsky had declared at the height of his dissident activities in the 1970s. \u201cIt is sick with the fear that we inherited from the time of Stalin\u2019s terror. But the process of society\u2019s spiritual regeneration has already begun and there is no stopping it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAn inveterate dissident, Mr. Bukovsky had displayed his independence since age 12, his mother once recalled to a correspondent for the Times, when he goaded a school principal into threatening, \u201cWe\u2019re going to gather evidence against you, Bukovsky, and you\u2019ll be expelled.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe was expelled from his high school and then, in 1961, from Moscow University for publishing writings critical of the Soviet regime and its trappings. His other early offenses included organizing public readings of the works of writers such as Boris Pasternak, the Nobel Prize-winning author whose book \u201cDoctor Zhivago\u201d had been banned in the Soviet Union, and Osip Mandelstam, regarded as one of the greatest Russian poets of the 20th century, who died in the gulag.\n\nMr. Bukovsky was first arrested in 1963, the beginning of nearly 12 years that he would spend in and out of prisons, performing forced labor and in the psychiatric hospitals whose existence he helped expose. In an effort to stifle protest, Soviet psychiatrists diagnosed dissidents with supposed disorders such as \u201csluggish schizophrenia\u201d and placed them in asylums.\n\nAD\n\nIf the detainee did not accept the diagnosis, \u201cit is considered a sign of a more advanced state of his illness, and he is treated accordingly,\u201d Mr. Bukovsky reported, according to a 1977 dispatch in the Times. \u201cIf he does not yield, he may remain there forever. I know of cases where people have spent more than 10 years in psychiatric hospitals.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDuring his imprisonment, Mr. Bukovsky\u2019s captors attempted to thwart his hunger strikes by force-feeding him through the nostril, an excruciating procedure that led him to denounce torture in all forms.\n\n\u201cThey straitjacketed me, tied me to a bed, and sat on my legs so that I would not jerk. The others held my shoulders and my head while a doctor was pushing the feeding tube into my nostril,\u201d he wrote in an account published in The Washington Post in 2005.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe feeding pipe was thick, thicker than my nostril, and would not go in. Blood came gushing out of my nose and tears down my cheeks, but they kept pushing until the cartilages cracked. I guess I would have screamed if I could, but I could not with the pipe in my throat. I could breathe neither in nor out at first; I wheezed like a drowning man \u2014 my lungs felt ready to burst. The doctor also seemed ready to burst into tears.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMr. Bukovsky\u2019s plight attracted the attention and condemnation of intellectual figures including Arthur Miller, Edward Albee and Vladi\u00admir Nabokov, as well as Amnesty International and members of the U.S. Congress. In 1976, in a dramatic episode of the Cold War facilitated by the United States, he was freed in exchange for the release in Chile of Luis Corval\u00e1n, the leader of the Communist Party in that country.\n\nMark Kramer, director of Cold War Studies at Harvard University, said in an interview that Mr. Bukovsky emerged from \u201chis experience in the Soviet Union looking like such a remarkably admirable figure because he stuck to his principles even when he was paying an extremely severe price for them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe made that choice in favor of sticking to his principles and he had to pay a very dear price for it,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cIt cost him 12 years in prison, 12 wasted years of life.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nVladimir Konstantinovich Bukovsky was born Dec. 30, 1942, in Belebei, a town in the Urals, where his family had sought safety during World War II. They returned to Moscow after the war. His father was a member of the Soviet writers\u2019 union, and his mother wrote children\u2019s programs for Radio Moscow.\n\nMr. Bukovsky studied biophysics before he was expelled from Moscow University, later resuming his studies at King\u2019s College Cambridge and Stanford University. He wrote books including a memoir, \u201cTo Build a Castle: My Life As A Dissenter,\u201d and the volume \u201cJudgment In Moscow: Soviet Crimes and Western Complicity.\u201d His resistance efforts were chronicled in the recently published volume \u201cThe Compatriots: The Brutal and Chaotic History of Russia\u2019s Exiles, \u00c9migr\u00e9s, and Agents Abroad\u201d by Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan.\n\nAD\n\nDuring his exile, Mr. Bukovsky returned to Russia on occasions including the run-up to the 2008 presidential elections, in which he sought to challenge Putin\u2019s successor, Dmitry Medvedev. Mr. Bukovsky was disqualified from the election, which Medvedev won before returning the post to Putin in 2012.\n\nAD\n\nIn recent years, Mr. Bukovsky again made headlines after British prosecutors charged him with 11 counts of child pornography offenses. He alleged that the illegal materials had been planted on his computer as a form of kompromat, or compromising material commonly used in the former Soviet Union to embarrass of blackmail political adversaries. After several delays, his trial was indefinitely postponed in 2018 because of his ill health.\n\nMr. Bukovsky\u2019s only immediate survivor was a sister. Elizabeth Childs, president of the San Francisco-based Bukovsky Center, said that he died at a hospital in Cambridge and that the cause was cardiac arrest.\n\nAD\n\nAmid his investigation on child pornography charges, Mr. Bukovsky mounted another hunger strike.\n\n\u201cAfter a while you slip into some kind of euphoria,\u201d he told the London Guardian, describing the sensation. \u201cYou\u2019re flying over the world. Imagination works perfectly. The brain is like a Swiss clock. Apparently the digestive function takes too much of blood and oxygen from our brain. Once you stop it, the brain works better than it did.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe said he was not afraid of death. \u201cHow can you be afraid of something inevitable?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a senseless death. It\u2019s a purposeful death. I\u2019m an old man anyway.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "He spent nearly 12 years in Soviet prisons, psychiatric hospitals and forced labor and later became an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.", "authors": ["Emily Langer", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wLmWkLUiUV7DHlUMwpn3wmi4X6k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MSAX6NHZSAI6TLEMR3HNFHFG54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
