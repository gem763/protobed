Sign up here.\n\nChicago teachers parodied a Lizzo song on the picket line, and it\u2019s Good as Hell.\n\nTeachers in the Chicago Public Schools have been on strike since last Thursday, when negotiations with the city over their union contract stalled out. They\u2019re asking for smaller class sizes, better pay, and more support staff, as well as more resources to help kids struggling with homelessness. While the city debates whether they want to agree to those demands, the teachers have kept their spirits up by rewriting lyrics to popular songs to apply to their strike \u2014 and performing them on the picket line.\n\nSo far, they\u2019ve done renditions of Chance the Rapper\u2019s \u201cNo Problem,\u201d Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s \u201cCall Me Maybe,\u201d and Lizzo\u2019s \u201cTruth Hurts.\u201d\n\nAnd Lizzo noticed. On Thursday, she retweeted the video of a teacher, jamming on her ukelele.\n\n\u201cWhy mayors great \u2018til they gotta be great?\u201d Rachel Johnson, a teacher at John B. Murphy school, sings in the video about Chicago\u2019s mayor, Lori Lightfoot. The union has accused Lightfoot of holding up the negotiations and backing off promises she made on the campaign trail. She also preempted the strike by cancelling classes Thursday last week \u2014 before the union had officially announced that it would go on strike.\n\n\u201cI just took a DNA test, turns out I\u2019m 100% on strike,\u201d Johnson continues in the video. \u201cYou could have had a contract, but you didn\u2019t. You could\u2019ve staffed your schools now, such a pity,\u201d\n\nThe teachers want the school district to give them a call when they\u2019re ready to make a deal, so they did a version of Carly Rae Jespen\u2019s \u201cCall Me Maybe,\u201d too.\n\n\u201cHey, we\u2019ve been striking, and this is crazy. When there\u2019s a contract, then call us maybe,\u201d a chorus of teachers sings in another video posted to Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been striking for so long, we wanna stop that,\u201d they continue. \u201cWe\u2019ve been teaching for so long, we wanna go back.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want no problems, no problems with CTU,\u201d they sang to the tune of Chance the Rapper\u2019s \u201cNo Problem,\u201d referring to the Chicago Teachers\u2019 Union.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to class size, yes we need a cap,\u201d raps Lindsay Prossnitz, a second grade teacher at Chicago Academy Elementary School. \u201cAnd our preschoolers deserve to take a nap.\u201d\n\nChance hasn\u2019t retweeted that video, but he has been vocal in his support for the striking teachers on Twitter. Back in 2017, he donated $1 million to the Chicago public school system.\n\nAnd here are more teachers doing a choreographed dance to The White Stripes\u2019 \u201cSeven Nation Army.\u201d\n\nThe strike\u2019s dragging on as the city and union haven\u2019t been able to come to a deal. The teachers are making an ambitious ask: In addition to the standard demands of higher pay and smaller class sizes, they\u2019re asking the public school system to do more to provide more affordable housing, city-wide \u2014 not just for students and teachers.\n\n\u201cI have kids who are experiencing homelessness, and they end up not coming to school because they fall through the cracks,\u201d Aaron Bingea, a 7th- and 8th-grade math teacher, previously told VICE News.\n\nCover image: Musical artist Lizzo performs at The Hollywood Palladium, Friday, Oct. 18, 2019, in Los Angeles.
