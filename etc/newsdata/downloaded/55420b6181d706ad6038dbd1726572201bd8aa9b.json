But grievances from the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees that have spilled into public from the private negotiations suggest a murky path forward for a bill that has been signed into law for nearly 60 years straight.\n\n\u201cI want to be really clear about this: There is one, and only one, reason why we\u2019re not making progress on the bill, and that\u2019s the wall,\u201d House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith David (Adam) Adam SmithOvernight Defense: Trump lifts sanctions on Turkey | 'Small number' of troops to remain by Syrian oil fields | Defense official's impeachment testimony delayed five hours after Republicans storm secure room Top Democrats warn against withdrawing from treaty that allows observation flights over Russia This year, let's cancel the Nobel Prize in economics MORE (D-Wash.) said.\n\nSenate Armed Services Chairman Jim Inhofe James (Jim) Mountain InhofeThe Hill's 12:30 Report \u2014 Presented by Nareit \u2014 White House cheers Republicans for storming impeachment hearing GOP senators frustrated with Romney jabs at Trump The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Diplomat's 'powerful' testimony and 'lynching' attract headlines MORE (R-Okla.) said separately that negotiations are \u201cnot going well\u201d and that the \u201cborder issue is probably the one that is the biggest issue.\u201d\n\nThe House version of the NDAA is full of hot-button topics apart from the border that were seen as nonstarters in the GOP-controlled Senate: an attempt to block U.S. military action against Iran, a reversal of Trump\u2019s transgender military ban and a ban on the deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons, among others.\n\nThe House NDAA passed in a party-line, 220-197 vote in July, while the Senate version passed in a bipartisan, 86-8 vote in June.\n\nThe non-border issues have remained contentious, too. Rep. Ro Khanna Rohit (Ro) KhannaCongress set for showdown with Trump over Kurds Is Congress too afraid to fight Big Pharma? Democrats probing whether groups booked Trump hotel rooms to earn president's favor: report MORE (D-Calif.), who sponsored the Iran amendment, said this week that is has been \u201ca tough lift\u201d during negotiations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, the House has launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump that has taken up most of the oxygen in Washington and dimmed hopes for major breakthroughs on legislation.\n\nBut top lawmakers are pinning stalled NDAA negotiations squarely on the border wall.\n\n\u201cImpeachment\u2019s got nothing to do with it,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd I think all the other issues would not be that difficult to resolve.\u201d\n\nThe wall has prominently stymied efforts at passing spending bills in recent years. The government shut down for 35 days in late December and January over border wall funding, and Congress passed a stopgap spending measure in September rather than a full year of appropriations because of an impasse on Trump\u2019s signature border project\n\nBut the defense policy bill is deeply embroiled in the issue after Trump tapped into about $6.1 billion in Pentagon funding in order to build the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAfter Trump declared a national emergency over the border at the beginning of the year, the Pentagon announced in September it was taking $3.6 billion from 127 military construction projects to build 175 miles of wall.\n\nSeparately, the Pentagon has also transferred $2.5 billion from various Department of Defense (DOD) accounts into its counter-drug fund for about 135 miles of wall.\n\nHouse Democrats, furious at what they describe as Trump circumventing Congress\u2019s power of the purse, included in the NDAA provisions to ban the use of Pentagon funds on the wall and limit the department's ability to transfer money between accounts.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s version, meanwhile, includes none of that and would backfill the $3.6 billion in military construction funding taken for the wall.\n\nAsked what specific border wall provisions are causing the impasse, Smith said it\u2019s \u201call\u201d of them.\n\nStill, Smith said he spoke this week with the White House about the issue, which he said means \u201cwe understand now where the differences are\u201d and that will help \u201cbridge that gap to get a bill done.\u201d\n\nThe White House had no comment on talks with Smith. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWith only about 20 legislative days left in 2019, Inhofe is pushing a backup plan to renew authorities that expire at the end of the year. On Tuesday, he plans to introduce what he is referring to as a \u201cskinny\u201d NDAA.\n\nAccording to a summary Inhofe showed reporters in the Senate basement this week, the skinny bill would cover a list of authorized military construction projects, transfer authorities, special and bonus pay for troops, benefits and pay for civilians in conflict zones, \u201clong-lead efficiencies\u201d for the F-35 program, operations and maintenance for cyber capabilities, counter-ISIS authorities and authorization for the supply line for operations in Afghanistan, among others.\n\nInhofe and his office insist he still hopes for a deal on the larger NDAA, describing his introduction of the skinny bill as a way to make it available if it\u2019s needed before time runs out. Inhofe put the odds at resorting to the skinny bill at 50-50.\n\n\u201cJust in case, in case it falls apart, we\u2019ll have a bill waiting in the Senate so our kids get paid,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Inhofe\u2019s skinny bill effort, too, appears doomed in the House over Trump\u2019s wall. Smith said he would not support it if it \u201callows [the president] to take money for the wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a victory for them on the wall,\u201d Smith said of the skinny bill. \u201cInhofe can go ahead and dress it up like he\u2019s making some offer, but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s just finding another way to give the president the ability to steal money out of DOD because the skinny bill doesn\u2019t prohibit him from doing that, and if he\u2019s not prohibited from doing it, he can do it.\u201d\n\nDespite the impasse, negotiators, mindful of the 58-year streak of passing an NDAA, insist they are not giving up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made progress, but we still have critical issues to address, and we\u2019re mutually determined to sit down to try to address them,\u201d said Sen.

No small thing that this bill, 58 straight years it\u2019s been signed into law. You don\u2019t want to be part of the one that breaks that streak,\u201d Thornberry said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody wants to throw the towel in. We\u2019re going to keep working.
