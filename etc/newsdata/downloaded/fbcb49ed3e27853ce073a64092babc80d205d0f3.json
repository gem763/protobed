Shoes off, cheesy feet slung over the seat in front, phone out on maximum brightness, shards of popcorn flying from their masticator while they slurp their over-sugared drink and discuss the plot spoilers with the person next to them, whether or not they know them.\n\nWell, this cinema in Switzerland is probably for them.\n\nPath\u00e9 Spreitenbach opened earlier this year offering the ultimate VIP experience. They\u2019ve replaced all the boring regular seats in one of their screens with eleven luxurious beds, complete with adjustable headrests, pillows and sheets we\u2019re assured are replaced after every showing. There are even bedside tables and a pair of slippers should you want to truly forget you\u2019re a fully-grown adult out in public.\n\nThose willing to fork out 49 Swiss Francs (about $73) for the privilege will also get unlimited food and non-alcoholic drink, and if you\u2019ve got little ones they can enjoy the separate children\u2019s cinema, with bean bags, a ball pit and a slide instead of stairs.\n\nWhile double sofas have become increasingly common in cinemas across Europe, Path\u00e9 are not the first to offer the opportunity to catch forty winks while watching Ad Astra (yes, Brad, we get it, you have daddy issues). The Electric in London\u2019s posh Notting Hill has six of them at the front of their single screen.\n\nOf course, as well as the danger you might fall asleep to the latest three-hour festival circuit favourite, there\u2019s also the possibility you\u2019ll be near a couple who are taking the engaging in some um, audience participation, while watching the latest Fifty Shades.\n\nBeds.
