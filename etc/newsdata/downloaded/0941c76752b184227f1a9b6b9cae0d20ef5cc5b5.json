Stephanie Borowicz (R) during a news conference. \u201cIf you can be declared dead when the heart stops, why not declared alive when it starts?\u201d\n\nBorowicz joined State Sen. Doug Mastriano (R) in fulfilling their promise to introduce legislation \u2014 Senate Bill 912 and House Bill 1977 \u2014 that would provide the U.S. Supreme Court another opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade, reported the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nAccording to the report, Ashley Lenker White, executive director of Planned Parenthood PA Advocates, said the legislation is \u201ca waste of taxpayer time and money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis bill is nothing but another unconstitutional attempt to ban abortion in Pennsylvania,\u201d she said.\n\nCourts have blocked the \u201cheartbeat\u201d laws of other states from going into effect.\n\nHowever, Kathy Barnette, a pro-life Fox News personality who has shared her story that she was conceived when her mother was raped, said the basis of abortion is eugenics and an attempt to eliminate the black population, reported the Inquirer.\n\n\u201cLynching got nothing on Planned Parenthood,\u201d Barnette said. \u201cWhat slavery could not do in 200 years, and what Jim Crow laws could not do in 100 years, abortion and organizations like Planned Parenthood have succeeded in annihilating whole generations of black people.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Gov. Tom Wolf, an abortion rights champion, has vowed to veto the legislation. He said in a press statement:\n\nLet me be clear: I will veto any abortion ban that is put on my desk. The latest bill, a six-week abortion ban, defies all practical understanding of modern women\u2019s health care. These policies run counter to the notion of individual freedom and lack a sound scientific basis. Further, as we have seen in other states, these policies are detrimental to efforts to attract and retain businesses, entrepreneurs and workers.\n\nToday, @GovernorTomWolf released this statement in opposition to abortion ban legislation and regressive health care policies targeting women and families. https://t.co/RehVmiDDYr \u2014 Office of the Governor (@GovernorsOffice) October 21, 2019\n\n\u201cMy administration is committed to reducing maternal mortality and giving women, children and families the support that they need to succeed,\u201d the governor continued. \u201cThis should be our focus, not regressive policies that make it harder for vulnerable people making difficult and deeply personal decisions.\u201d\n\nHowever, in mentioning \u201cmaternal mortality,\u201d Wolf appeared to be tapping into false claims spread by Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry, and now showing up in some of the 2020 Democrats\u2019 statements, that \u201cthousands of women died\u201d prior to the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade and that \u201cwomen will die\u201d if abortion is made illegal once more.\n\nThe claim has reached feverish pitch since the pro-life Trump administration has now appointed two Supreme Court justices who intend to interpret the Constitution as it was originally written.\n\nHowever, Planned Parenthood\u2019s own fact sheets tell a very different story.\n\nThe abortion industry giant states:\n\nIn 1965, when abortion was still illegal nationwide except in cases of life endangerment, at least 193 women died from illegal abortions, and illegal abortion accounted for nearly 17 percent of all deaths due to pregnancy and childbirth in that year (Gold, 1990; NCHS, 1967).\n\nThe pro-choice Guttmacher Institute also reported:\n\nBy 1950, illegal abortion deaths fell to \u201cjust over 300,\u201d likely \u201cbecause of the introduction of antibiotics in 1940s, which permitted more effective treatment of the infections frequently developed after illegal abortion.\u201d By 1965, \u201cthe number of deaths due to illegal abortion had fallen to just under 200.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 1972, the year before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe, 24 women died from legal induced abortion \u2014 legal in a handful of states in which abortion in some very limited cases was permitted \u2014 and 39 women died from illegal abortion.\n\nIn 1973, when the Supreme Court created a right to abortion, CDC reported 19 deaths from illegal abortions and 25 deaths from legal abortions.\n\nThough abortion reporting measures have not been consistent \u2014 leading to differing results \u2014 none of the reports gave the indication that \u201cthousands\u201d of women died in illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade.\n\nAs pro-life organization Live Action reported, NARAL founder and former abortionist Bernard Nathanson admitted he and others fabricated large numbers of deaths from illegal abortions prior to the high court\u2019s decision in Roe.\n\nAccording to the report, in his 1979 book, Aborting America, Nathanson called the \u201cthousands\u201d claim a \u201cnice, round, shocking figure.\u201d\n\nLife News reported Nathanson said of the fabrication, \u201c[I]n the \u2018morality\u2019 of our revolution, it was a useful figure, widely accepted so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics?\u201d\n\nAbortion industry leaders and their political allies, however, are still suggesting \u201cwomen will die\u201d if abortion is banned. The fact is, women still die during \u201clegal\u201d abortions and \u201cthousands\u201d of unborn children die each year because abortion is not banned.\n\nWolf\u2019s nod to \u201cmaternal mortality\u201d hearkens back to another false claim: that maternal mortality rates increased in Texas after funding cuts to Planned Parenthood clinics.\n\nThis claim is still being repeated by abortion advocates and their allies in politics and the media despite having been debunked about two years ago.\n\n\u201cWe know what happens when our health centers are forced to close around the country,\u201d ousted Planned Parenthood president Dr. Leana Wen told NowThisNews in May. \u201cIn Texas, 30,000 women went without access to care. Maternal mortality rates increased\u201d:\n\n\u2018The consequence will be women\u2019s lives.\u2019 \u2014 @PPFA Pres. @DrLeanaWen is explaining the real, deadly results of banning abortion pic.twitter.com/cykbl4JjCA \u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) May 20, 2019\n\nThe Washington Post published a fact check with the headline, \u201cNo, maternal mortality did not spike in Texas after funding cuts to abortion clinics.\u201d\n\nGlenn Kessler at the Post conducted the fact check following Rep. Don Beyer\u2019s (D-VA) comments in a House Ways and Means Committee hearing.\n\nBeyer stated:\n\nAnti-abortion bills increase maternal mortality and infant mortality. Texas is the best case. The reported rate of maternal deaths in Texas doubled when the state closed their abortion clinics and cut funding for Planned Parenthood. The fact is that if Texas was a country it would have the highest maternal mortality rate of any developed country in the world.\n\nHowever, the data cited by Beyer on the alleged increased maternal deaths in Texas has now been shown to be flawed.\n\nThe study claimed the maternal mortality rate (MMR) in Texas had suddenly doubled, and abortion supporters and their media allies added the spin that the \u201cdoubling\u201d was due to Texas\u2019s defunding of Planned Parenthood.\n\nAs Kessler explained, Marian MacDorman conducted the flawed study on MMR in Texas that generated the claim. The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Obstetrics and Gynecology (ObGyn).\n\nThe Texas Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force found errors in the original study and corrected the 2012 data from 38.4 deaths per 100,000 live births to 14.6 per 100,000 live births.\n\nIn 2017, Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI) scholars James Studnicki and John Fisher had already debunked the MacDorman study, exposing its flawed methodology, and informed ObGyn months before the Texas Task Force report.\n\nCLI President Chuck Donovan commented:\n\nTotal maternal deaths in Texas were less than half what MacDorman concluded in her heralded study \u2013 56 deaths, rather than 147. Moreover, Texas had experienced a spike in maternal deaths almost a decade earlier, and California had experienced an even larger one, facts MacDorman\u2019s study had obscured because of its failure to apply a mathematical adjustment to historical data across the board.\n\nIn January, a Marist poll found 75 percent of Americans favor substantial restrictions on abortion, including 60 percent of Democrats and 61 percent of those who identify as \u201cpro-choice.\u201d\n\nAccording to that poll, 75 percent of Americans say abortion should be limited to \u2014 at most \u2014 the first three months of pregnancy. Among those who identify as Republicans, 92 percent want that restriction, as do 78 percent of independents and 60 percent of Democrats. Perhaps most significantly, 61 percent of those who identify as \u201cpro-choice\u201d share that view.\n\nThe survey found 65 percent of Americans say if the Supreme Court revisits Roe v. Wade, the high court should either return the issue of the legality of abortion to the states (49 percent) or outlaw the procedure altogether (16 percent). Only 30 percent of those surveyed would prefer that the Supreme Court rule in favor of unrestricted abortion.\n\nAnother Marist poll released in February found the number of Democrats now identifying as \u201cpro-life\u201d shifted from 20 percent to 34 percent following recent abortion legislation in states such as New York, which lifted restrictions on the procedure. The number of \u201cpro-choice\u201d Democrats shifted downward from 75 percent to 61 percent.\n\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, 18,507 of the 30,011 abortions performed in 2017 in the state were conducted at eight weeks gestation or less.", "description": "Pennsylvania lawmakers introduced a \"heartbeat\" abortion bill that would ban abortions once an unborn baby\u2019s heartbeat can be detected.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1133965368-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
