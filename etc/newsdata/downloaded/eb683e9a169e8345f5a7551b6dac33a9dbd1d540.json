At the end of the day it\u2019s just one of those things and it'll be old news next week. There'll be someone else.\"\n\nRebekah has vehemently denied leaking stories about Coleen and said in her own statement that it was \"disgusting\" that she even had to deny it, especially when she's heavily pregnant.\n\nShe was so upset that she cut her Dubai holiday short and flew back home.\n\nBecky claimed she has hired a forensic IT expert to prove her innocence and is considering legal action.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut representatives for Coleen say she has irrefutable evidence that the leaks came from Rebekah's account.\n\nDanielle added: \"Maybe we might find out exactly what happened - who knows?\n\n\"I've had my own family members sell stories on me and it just divides the family and I would never speak to that person again.\n\n\"It's not nice, I've had it done to me and they full on knew what they were doing and they were like, 'Yeah it's me, I'm selling the story'.\n\n\"So for people to be selling stories on you and you don\u2019t know who they are, it's not nice not knowing who you can trust.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Danielle Lloyd came to Coleen Rooney's defence amid her showdown with Rebekah Vardy - and says she's also had stories sold on her", "authors": ["Vicki Newman", "Image", "Getty Images For Nickelodeon Sli", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20659834.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Nickelodoen-Slimefest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
