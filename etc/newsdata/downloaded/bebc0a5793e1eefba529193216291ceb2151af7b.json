It\u2019s an irreversible part of Americana.\u201d\n\nPerceiving a shift away from the hamburger, then, could really set people off \u2014 causing an angry response that activists say is inevitable.\n\n\u201cWe used to just fly under their radar, but it doesn\u2019t happen that way anymore,\u201d Melanie Joy, a psychologist and activist and author of books including Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows, tells Yahoo Lifestyle about vegan activists and the meat industry. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not surprised. When a social movement gets strong enough to really challenge the power of the dominant system, the system fights back, and one strategy is to discredit beliefs and practices and everything that represents this change.\u201d\n\nEnter the full-page New York Times ad \u2014 and similar ones in USA Today and the Wall Street Journal \u2014 which noted that \u201cReal burgers are brats and made from beef, pork, and spices.\u201d\n\n\"What's hiding in your plant-based meat?\" asks a new add, featuring this image, from the Center for Consumer Freedom. (Photo: Center for Consumer Freedom) More\n\nThe campaign comes courtesy of the Center for Consumer Freedom, run by well-known lobbyist and publicist Richard Berman, whose past targets have included the Humane Society, the CDC and Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Now it appears that PETA and other members of what the website calls the \u201cfood police\u201d are in Berman\u2019s crosshairs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of our campaign to present information to consumers that they may not be aware of,\u201d Will Coggin, managing director of CCF, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWith a spate of recent stories, good and bad, regarding the fake meat industry, and Beyond Meat\u2019s falling stock in the news, we thought it was an opportune time to get our message out there.\u201d\n\nThe same day the latest CCF ad ran, House Representatives Anthony Brindisi and Roger Marshall introduced bipartisan legislation \u2014 backed by the biggest beef lobbying group in the U.S. \u2014 that would stop plant-based meat companies from using the word \u201cmeat\u201d to market their products. The National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association says the legislation is necessary to protect consumers from \u201cdeceptive marketing practices, and cattle producers need to be able to compete on a fair, level playing field.\u201d\n\nBut environmental and sustainable-food advocates reject that reasoning, noting that instead of being confused, consumers are making conscious decisions to buy plant-based alternatives to meat and cow\u2019s milk \u2014 and that language options for describing certain foods are limited.", "description": "With vegan foods surging into the mainstream, pushback has grown among those who resent the shift.
