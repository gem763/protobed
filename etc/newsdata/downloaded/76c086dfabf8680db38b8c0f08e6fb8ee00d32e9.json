So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly with markets near all-time highs.\n\nThe following are some notable insider purchases reported in the past week.\n\nKraft Heinz\n\nKraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC) saw two directors buying some shares last week. At $28.27 to $28.60 apiece, the almost 3.75 million shares reportedly acquired altogether totaled more than $107.11 million. Note that the larger of the two purchases was pursuant to Rule 144(g).\n\nAlso note a large sale of shares this past week by a beneficial owner. Shares were trading at $28.14 apiece on last look, just below the above purchase price range. The stock has changed hands as high as $58.08 a share in the past year, but the analysts' consensus price target is just $28.39.\n\nAcadia Pharmaceuticals\n\nA beneficial owner of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAD) purchased more than 1.56 million shares of this biopharmaceutical company. At $40 per share, the transaction totaled $62.5 million. That brought the stake to almost 37.5 million shares in a total float of over 144 million.\n\nThe purchase was part of a 6.25-million share common stock offering last week. The stock was last seen trading at $34.35 a share in a 52-week range of $22.94 to $39.74.\n\nThe consensus analyst price target is $44.83, with a consensus recommendation to buy shares.\n\nSee also: Insider Buying Vs.

The transaction totaled more than $2.24 million.\n\nNote that another director sold more than 45,000 shares at about the same time. The stock closed most recently at $22.97, which is above the purchase price range above.\n\nShares have traded as high as $29.95 in the past 52 weeks, but analysts currently anticipate the price will only go to $29.44.\n\nAbbVie\n\nAfter two executives bought AbbVie Inc (NYSE: ABBV) shares in August, a vice chair now has stepped up to the buy window.\n\nAt $69.86 to $70.73 apiece, the 25,000 shares acquired most recently totaled more than $1.76 million.
