In emails supplied to Congress by the state department inspector general, Kent expressed concerns about White House efforts to remove the then ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is moving at dizzying speed. The Axios website noted that if everyone agrees to appear, Democrats will have interviewed 11 administration officials by the end of next week. Every witness has \u201cbolstered the case against Trump\u201d, Axios added, leaving White House officials demoralised or panicked.\n\nThe hearings have been held behind closed doors but Democrats may yet decide to publish transcripts. Trump, who has been leading his own defence, tweeted on Tuesday: \u201cDemocrats are allowing no transparency at the Witch Hunt hearings. If Republicans ever did this they would be excoriated by the Fake News. Let the facts come out from the charade of people, most of whom I do not know, they are interviewing for nine hours each, not selective leaks.\u201d\n\nI am not part of whatever drug deal Rudy and Mulvaney are cooking up \u2026 Giuliani\u2019s a hand grenade John Bolton\n\nThe torrent of damaging revelations continued on Monday when Fiona Hill, a British-born former senior director for Europe and Russia on the White House National Security Council (NSC), spoke to the House committees for 10 hours.\n\nAccording to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, Hill described a sharp exchange on 10 July between the then national security adviser, John Bolton, and the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland. It concerned the role played by Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor commonly described as Trump\u2019s lawyer, in trying to persuade the Ukrainian government to open investigations into Democrats including Biden.\n\nHill said Bolton instructed her to tell the NSC\u2019s attorney that Giuliani was acting in concert with White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, in a rogue operation with legal implications.\n\n\u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Rudy and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d Bolton instructed Hill to tell the NSC lawyer, according to her testimony.\n\nThe House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, arrives for a closed door meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday.

A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are.\n\nThe process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives.\n\nThe chief justice of the US supreme court then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote to convict. Republicans currently control the Senate, with 53 of the 100 senators.\n\nTwo presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him.", "description": "* State department official George Kent testifies in private  * Hunter Biden admits \u2018poor judgment\u2019 but denies wrongdoing  * US politics \u2013 live coverageGeorge Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, second from right, arrives to appear before a joint session of House committees considering possible", "authors": ["Julian Borger", "David Smith In Washington", "Tom Mccarthy", "Ed Pilkington In New York"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/r0qPyO3rS.Ob6DH0YZgasw--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/1bfd21df70a3346b319fe7cee81bd29f", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
