It is a step in the right direction,\" Felix Agbor Nkongho, a leading anglophone lawyer and human-rights defender who is taking part in the forum, told AFP.\n\n\"But we call for a general amnesty to all those in detention and those in the diaspora under investigation.\"\n\nDetained leaders\n\nIn August, secessionist leader Julius Ayuk Tabe - the self-proclaimed president of \"Ambazonia\" - was sentenced to life in prison along with nine of his supporters.\n\nBiya, in his announcement of the \"dialogue\" on September 10, made no mention of any release of these figures, although he reiterated an offer to \"pardon\" any separatists who voluntarily lay down their arms.\n\nEnglish-speakers account for about a fifth of Cameroon's population of 24 million.\n\nThey are mainly concentrated in the Northwest and Southwest regions, which were folded into Cameroon after the colonial era in Africa wound down six decades ago.\n\nResentment has festered there for years among English-speakers who complain of discrimination and marginalisation, especially in education, the judiciary and economic opportunities.\n\nBiya, 86, who has been in power for nearly 37 years, has repeatedly refused demands for decentralisation or a return to a federal structure - a move blamed for radicalisation of the anglophone movement.", "description": "President Paul Biya ordered the release of several hundred detainees linked to the separatist crisis in Cameroon's anglophone regions as talks on the turmoil ended their fourth day.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9438/6e501377af044eaf96c42781b2593242.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
