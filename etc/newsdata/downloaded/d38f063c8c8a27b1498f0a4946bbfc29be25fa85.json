This involved responding to questions that monitored how much attention was paid to the children, the amount of fun they had with their parents and how much they felt understood within their families.\n\nRespondents were analysed in four follow-up sessions that tracked how their mental health and family relationships changed over time.\n\nThe study concluded that overall, people with low levels of family conflict and positive familiar relationships experienced fewer depressive symptoms.\n\nLead author Dr Ping Chen of North Carolina University said: \u201cOur findings appear to provide new understanding of the long-term association between early family relationships and lifetime development of depression.\n\n\u201cThese sources of social and emotional support in early family life are likely encourage the development of skills for coping with changing and cumulative stressors, promoting mental health throughout the life course from early adolescence to midlife and helping to prevent negative outcomes and premature deaths due to suicide, alcohol or drugs in middle age.\u201d\n\nIf you have been affected by any issues mentioned in this article, you can contact The Samaritans for free on 116 123 or any of the following mental health organisations:\n\nmind.org.uk\n\nnhs.uk/livewell/mentalhealth\n\nmentalhealth.org.uk\n\nsamaritans.org\n\nanxietyuk.org.uk", "description": "Having a good relationship with your family in adolescence may help lower the risk of developing depression as an adult, new research suggests.
