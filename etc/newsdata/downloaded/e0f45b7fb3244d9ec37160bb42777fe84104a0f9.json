Mr. Trump has said previously he\u2019d consider including Huawei in negotiations for a trade deal with China.\n\nThe Trump administration blacklisted Huawei based on fears that it is too cozy with the communist Beijing government and could use its 5G equipment for surveillance or to disrupt networks \u2014 charges the company denies.\n\nMr. Trump says foreign partners should use other companies in their lightning-fast cellular networks.\n\nTraveling in Iceland, Vice President Mike Pence said he encouraged his hosts to \u201crecognize the profound issues that arise from any free nation embracing the technology and equipment of Huawei.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuawei is essentially a Chinese company that under Chinese law is required to turn over all the data that they collect to the Chinese government and the Communist party,\u201d Mr. Pence said Wednesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that\u2019s consistent with the security of free nations. We don\u2019t believe it\u2019s consistent with the privacy of people that enjoy freedom in nations like the United States and Iceland.\u201d\n\nLast weekend, the U.S. and Poland signed a 5G-security agreement that calls on both nations to consider whether \u201ca supplier is subject, without independent judicial review, to control by a foreign government.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said the Chinese economy is having is having \u201ctheir worst year in over half a century.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would think they want to solve a problem,\u201d the president said.\n\nThe U.S. agricultural sector has been hit hard by the loss of the Chinese market. But two Republican lawmakers from major agricultural states, Sens. David Perdue of Georgia and Steve Daines of Montana, met with top Chinese officials in Beijing in recent days to convey that Congress supports Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cSenator Daines and I traveled to China with one goal: to help reinforce President Trump\u2019s efforts to level the playing field with all of our trading partners,\u201d Mr. Perdue said in a statement. \u201cWe were there to emphasize that the president and his negotiating team have strong support from Congress. The president deserves high marks for standing up for American workers, farmers, and manufacturers. China clearly sees that America is serious about achieving equal access.\u201d\n\nThe president said he approved the lawmakers\u2019 meeting with the Chinese officials.\n\n\u201cChina asked for the meeting,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAll they did is say that we really have bipartisan support, and the support is very serious, so we\u2019re not playing games. They absolutely had my permission. They told me the attitude of China. Basically they told me China would like to do something \u2014 I know they\u2019d like to do something.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Reserve said Wednesday the U.S. economy is still growing steadily and most businesses are optimistic, even in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade wars.\n\nIn The Fed\u2019s latest report on economic conditions nationwide, hiring increased modestly in most industries, though manufacturing employment declined in some areas. The survey covers mid-July to late-August.\n\nThe report, known as the beige book, consists of anecdotal accounts from business executives in the Fed\u2019s 12 regional districts.\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
