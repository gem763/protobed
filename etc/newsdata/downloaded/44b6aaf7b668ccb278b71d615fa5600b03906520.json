It states that you are entitled to services to be carried out with reasonable skill and care.\n\nIf they aren\u2019t, you may claim a full refund for the time you were unable to use your phone as a result of the outage. When you break it down, it\u2019s probably not huge amounts, unless you\u2019re paying a crazy amount of money for your contract.\n\nThe key thing to remember is that you\u2019re also entitled to redress for any out-of-pocket expenses you incurred as a direct consequence of being unable to use any of your phone\u2019s usual functionality.\n\nFor example, if you had to use a payphone to make calls, the cost of those calls could be the subject of a refund. But it may also cover your costs if you incurred bank charges because you couldn\u2019t transfer money.\n\nKeep a detailed note of what impact the loss of functionality had, including the times, actions and direct financial consequences and then once the system is working again calculate your losses.", "description": "Customers of Three mobile network have received as much as \u00a320 compensation\u00a0in the form of a credit on their bill after last week\u2019s outage.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/06/12/15/three-mobile.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
