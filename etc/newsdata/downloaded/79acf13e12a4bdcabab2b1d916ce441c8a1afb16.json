Raised by old-fashioned European parents in Texas, where she excelled at sports before discovering drama, she\u2019s had three Oscar nominations and one win. Her first two were for Best Actress in 2001 romantic comedy \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary,\u201d and in 2002, for Best-Picture winning musical \u201cChicago.\u201d By her third go-round in 2004, she was overdue: Zellweger took home the Best Supporting Actress statuette for her twangy, gun-totin\u2019 North Carolina farmer in \u201cCold Mountain.\u201d\n\nFifteen years later, the 50-year-old Zellweger has a new story to tell. At her Telluride Film Festival tribute, she choked up as she watched clips from her life in pictures, including the iconic moment in \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d when the 26-year-old actress looked across a roomful of girlfriends at love-professing Tom Cruise and said, \u201cYou had me at hello.\u201d\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a visual diary,\u201d she said the next day, casual in baseball cap, jeans and sneakers. \u201cAll the memories came flooding back quickly, and it was overwhelming. I was mortified because it feels ridiculous to be somehow acknowledged for having been so lucky. I was remembering my friends, the directors on the sets, the hilarity of the struggles behind getting these moments, the difficulty of it, and the collaboration. It\u2019s a life, isn\u2019t it, it\u2019s a life! I didn\u2019t expect to be overcome with emotion like that.\u201d\n\nNow Zellweger is adding a new chapter. After a six-year hiatus from filmmaking, she returned to acting in 2016 with \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Baby\u201d ($212 million worldwide). She notched a couple of small indie roles and had a fine time playing deliciously wicked tech mogul Anne Montgomery on the Netflix soap opera \u201cWhat/If.\u201d \u201cIt was so much fun, it was a riot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the best time, to go to work every day and say the thing you never would \u2014 but Anne will! What fun, what a dream! I\u2019d never done that before.\u201d\n\nThis fall, she\u2019s back in the awards hunt with her juiciest role in \u201cJudy.\u201d Based on the West End-to-Broadway stage play \u201cEnd of the Rainbow,\u201d Rupert Goold\u2019s film focuses on Judy Garland\u2019s last London concerts in the weeks before the crooner\u2019s tragic death by overdose in 1969. She was 47. The movie rides Garland\u2019s emotional swells as she struggles with her lifelong addictions, being separated from her two youngest children, and her turbulent final marriage to younger man Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock). Zellweger channels the fragile, rail-thin, bewigged Garland, performing six of her songs live, from \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d and \u201cYou Made Me Love You\u201d to a devastating \u201cOver the Rainbow.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudy\u201d nabbed a huge Toronto response for Zellweger, who is heading toward inevitable SAG, Golden Globe, and Oscar nominations. Her comeback narrative, combined with the irresistible Garland songbook, will be catnip to awards voters. Zellweger, like Garland herself, is drawing both admiration and sympathy.\n\nWhat Zellweger does with Garland is remarkable. She conjures an iconic Hollywood figure but doesn\u2019t disappear inside her. She remains herself, finding both vulnerability and strength inside this driven performer. Director Goold and her hair, makeup, and costume team piled Garland\u2019s look onto Zellweger, including false eyelashes and teeth, as well as a dark brown wig and contacts to cover her light eyes and hair. Then, they pared back to bare essentials.\n\n\u201cHe extracted and minimized,\u201d said Zellweger. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want a makeup-chair shoot, constantly doing maintenance and worrying about distracting people with what looked false. He felt the more we did, the less authentic it would be. We\u2019d be looking at artifice instead of something connected to emotion.\u201d (At her tribute, Goold said: \u201cWith the look, the voice, the exceptional theatricality, like all great actors, the more other she became, and the more the role she became, the more I felt I was seeing something of herself, her own soul.\u201d)\n\nIn 2010, Zellweger moved to a rural home in the Northeast to hang with friends and family. She also studied at UCLA, traveled, and wrote a Lifetime TV pilot. (\u201cI can\u2019t be idle,\u201d she said. \u201cI am my Swiss father\u2019s daughter.\u201d) But after a decade-long work jag, she said she needed to remind herself of who she really was.", "description": "The actress told IndieWire that stepping away from Hollywood was smart: \"There was quite a bit of chaos that you can only mask for so long.\"", "authors": ["Anne Thompson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/W5a7E.JG2KPdJWQ1Lksgmw--~B/aD03MzA7dz0xMjEyO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/indiewire_268/5aead80ab5c4b2d77df33fac45caf3a2", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
