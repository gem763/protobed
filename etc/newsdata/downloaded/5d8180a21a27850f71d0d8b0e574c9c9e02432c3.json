Use the wrong words, express the wrong opinion, and you can quickly find yourself \u201ccancelled\u201d.\n\nOne of the latest victims of the internet cancellation machine is Natalie Wynn, a trans woman who has built a large following on her YouTube channel ContraPoints. Wynn is known for her smart, surreal, Wildesque video essays, which explore everything from incels to capitalism and frequently get more than a million views.\n\n\u2018It takes a lot of courage\u2019: Rebekah Robertson on raising transgender activist Georgie Stone Read more\n\nRefreshingly, Wynn thinks about things rather than shouts about them; she embraces nuance. She is, to borrow a phrase the New York Times bizarrely used to describe the rightwing pundit Ben Shapiro, \u201cthe cool kid\u2019s philosopher\u201d.\n\nBut last week, she became persona non grata. Her crime? Wynn tweeted that she wasn\u2019t always a big fan of \u201cpronoun introductions\u201d: an exercise in which people go around and say their names alongside their preferred pronouns. Wynn\u2019s issue with the practice is that even though the whole point is to foster inclusivity, it can make her feel like she doesn\u2019t fit in.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this paradox where I can go to a sports bar in North Carolina and be miss/ma\u2019amed all night, no question,\u201d Wynn tweeted. \u201cBut in self-consciously trans-inclusive spaces I have to explain my pronouns and watch woke people awkwardly correct themselves every time they say \u2018you guys\u2019.\u201d\n\nWynn added: \u201cI guess [pronoun introductions are] good for people who use they/them only and want only gender neutral language. But it comes at the minor expense of semi-passable transes like me, and that\u2019s super fucking hard for us.\u201d\n\n(If you know Wynn\u2019s work, the last words should be read with a hint of self-deprecation.)\n\nWynn was quickly inundated by angry messages from a small number of highly vocal non-binary people who thought she was invalidating their identity. She was also accused of benefiting from \u201cpassing privilege\u201d because she is a conventionally attractive white woman. The backlash was so bad that Wynn deleted her Twitter account. The anger doesn\u2019t appear to have abated \u2013 this week, rumours that Wynn has been doxxed started circulating.\n\nThe politicization of pronouns\n\nLittle attention used to be paid to pronouns. In recent years, however, they have become a cornerstone of the culture wars.\n\nPronoun preferences are a favourite joke among unimaginative reactionaries who use them as proof that \u201csnowflake millennials\u201d just want to feel special. In Dave Chappelle\u2019s latest Netflix stand-up special, for example, he jokes: \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on, fellas? Lady. Whatever pronoun makes you feel comfortable in the back.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, pronoun introductions have become an established feature of some progressive spaces and university campuses. Many view this as a positive step towards a more nuanced understanding of gender. As Darius Hickman, a 23-year-old non-binary poet in New York says, these introductions mean people who don\u2019t conform to traditional views of binary gender don\u2019t feel alienated.\n\n\u201cRelying on clocking people\u2019s gender based on appearances is harmful, especially since some people \u2013 oftentimes non-binary folks \u2013 can happen to look strictly binary, and a simple pronoun check makes things easier for everyone, including folks whose gender isn\u2019t easy to tell.\u201d\n\nBut when gender is so complex and personal, is there really any such thing as a \u201csimple\u201d pronoun check?\n\nAt this stage, I should probably note that although I identify as a Progressive Lesbian\u2122, the pressure of pronoun introductions often makes me feel uncomfortable. Actively announcing myself as a she/her makes it seem like I\u2019m making my entire identity about my gender, which feels regressive.\n\nFurther, while pronoun introductions are supposed to be about recognizing that gender is complex, it sometimes seems as though they \u2013 paradoxically \u2013 reinforce gender binaries. Announcing yourself as a \u201cshe\u201d, \u201che\u201d or \u201cthey\u201d would appear to buy into the notion that a \u201che\u201d is completely different from a \u201cshe\u201d \u2013 and if you don\u2019t subscribe to traditional gender roles you should identify yourself as a \u201cthey\u201d.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be better if we just worked towards a future where \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d weren\u2019t weighted with so much meaning? What if we worked to break those limitations down instead?\n\nPerhaps. But, notes Lal Zimman, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara who focusses on the linguistic practices of LGBQT speakers, we can\u2019t escape the fact that pronouns play an important role in how we see the world. Like it or not, \u201cwe tend to take a lot of social cues from pronouns. Even hearing a pronoun in a sentence can make you picture someone very differently.\u201d Being more mindful about them \u201cchallenges people\u2019s ideas about how gender works in a fundamental way\u201d.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say that pronoun introductions are entirely without difficulty. \u201cI think Wynn is absolutely right that people engage with that practice in ways that can be somewhat problematic,\u201d Zimman says. Sometimes pronoun introductions only happen when a gender non-conforming person is in the room, for example. Naturally, that person can feel singled out. In Zimman\u2019s view, you solve this problem by normalizing pronoun introduction so everyone is clear it is standard and hasn\u2019t been rolled out specifically for them.\n\nIt\u2019s not just people feeling singled out that is potentially problematic, however; pronoun introductions can be uncomfortable for people who are still figuring out their gender identity. Rachel Levin, a professor at Pomona College, has observed this on a number of occasions among her students, inspiring her to write a piece for Inside Higher Ed last year that suggested \u201casking everyone their preferred personal pronoun is not a good idea\u201d.\n\nThe confidence gap: what attitudes to meeting aliens reveal about the sexes Read more\n\n\u201cUndergrads are often still in the process of finding themselves,\u201d Levin says. They\u2019re often still a work in progress. Pronoun introductions can \u201cforce people to out themselves or lie in a room full of strangers. Let\u2019s not make the most marginalized people in the room feel uncomfortable by posing as allies.\u201d\n\nLevin doesn\u2019t avoid the issue of pronouns altogether. \u201cI usually make some statements to the class about the importance of pronouns and why I\u2019m not asking,\u201d she explains, \u201cso that allyship and responsibility is signaled and nobody is made uncomfortable.\u201d She also emails students before the class begins asking them to let her know if they have any concerns about correct pronoun usage, or if their name hasn\u2019t been officially recorded.\n\nIs \u2018they\u2019 the answer to the pronoun problem?\n\nWhat about the growing popularity of the singular \u201cthey\u201d? About one in five Americans say they personally know someone who prefers a gender-neutral pronoun like \u201cthey\u201d rather than he/she, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in fall 2018. They has become so mainstream that, earlier this year, a New York Times op-ed columnist announced that we should all move away \u201cfrom the stifling prison of gender expectations\u201d and use \u201cthey\u201d.\n\nThis may seem like a neat way of avoiding pronoun problems, but it is reductive. Professor Grace Lavery at UC Berkley notes that \u201cpeople outside the trans community tend to assume that \u2018they\u2019 is a catch-all \u2013 but it isn\u2019t. For plenty of trans and non-binary people, \u2018they\u2019 has very concrete and distinctive meanings. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a generalizable term. Additionally, for binary trans people, \u2018they\u2019 is often a place where we get stuck \u2013 people prepared to acknowledge some of our transition, but not all of it. Assuming pronouns in advance, even neutral ones, can lead to significant problems.\u201d\n\nZimman echoes this, explaining that a blanket use of \u201cthey\u201d doesn\u2019t align with the idea that people should have some agency in how they are referred to. \u201cI like to think of someone\u2019s pronouns in a similar way to how I\u2019d think about their name. You can\u2019t just look at someone and say, \u2018Hey, you look like a Stephanie \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to call you.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe manage to learn a lot of names over the course of our lives,\u201d Zimman adds. \u201cWe learn names that are unusual or hard to pronounce. We recognize that\u2019s just part of being a human being and having positive relationships with other humans. I\u2019d like to see the same attitude applied to pronouns.\u201d\n\nAt this stage I should probably wrap everything up with a tidy conclusion. But I think the key message is that there are no tidy conclusions \u2013 other than the fact that we should treat each other with kindness and respect.\n\nGender is messy and complicated and incredibly emotional. Pronouns are personal, and everybody\u2019s relationship with them is different.
