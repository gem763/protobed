David Smith, the commander of the 158th Fighter Wing, the new home to the F-35s, said after the planes arrived.\n\nBut for some members of the community, the arrival of noisier aircraft marks the failure of yearslong efforts to keep the Air Force from delivering the planes to an airport that sits amid residential neighborhoods and industrial complexes in the middle of Vermont\u2019s most populous county.\n\nRosanne Greco, the former chair of the South Burlington City Council and a retired Air Force colonel, said she supported basing the plane in her home city until she learned by reading the Air Force\u2019s environmental impact statement about how noisy the F-35 is and what she feels are the dangers of having a new, unproven weapon system at a suburban airport.\n\n\u201cAll I had to do was read what the Air Force said about the impact it would have,\u201d Greco said. \u201cThe evidence was overwhelming it would have a very negative effect on close to 7,000 people\u201d who live near the airport.\n\nSmith said prior to Thursday\u2019s arrival that the Air National Guard understands the concerns. The Guard has modified traffic patterns the planes will use and checked the takeoff times to minimize noise disruptions, he said.\n\nAs for safety, he said, more than 400 F-35s have been delivered so far, and the planes have accumulated more than 200,000 flying hours.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to us to do everything we can to mitigate the impact on the community,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Air Force describes the F-35 as its fifth-generation fighter, combining stealth technology with speed and agility. Different models are being built for the Air Force, Navy and Marines and are being sold to U.S. allies across the world.\n\nIt is also the U.S. military\u2019s most expensive weapons system of all time, with an estimated total cost of $1.5 trillion over the expected half-century life of the program. The model of plane that will be based in Burlington cost about $94 million each.\n\nAssigning F-35s, which are designed to replace a number of aging fighter models, to Vermont shows the days are long gone when Air National Guard units received hand-me-down aircraft while new planes went exclusively to active duty Air Force units, said Ian Bryan, a retired Tennessee Air National Guard pilot who worked in Washington as a legislative liaison with the National Guard Bureau.\n\nVermont, and the Guard, are at the forefront of learning how to make the best use of the new airplanes, he said.\n\n\u201cTen years from now, we need to have figured out how to use this F-35 thing, and it\u2019s going to be the lead as the wings fall off some of these old airplanes,\u201d Bryan said.\n\nVermont Air Guard Lt. Col. Tony \u201cScrappy\u201d Marek, one of the pilots who flew to Burlington on Thursday, said flying the F-35 is similar to the F-16 he used to fly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been over a decade in the making,\u201d Market said. \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable airplane. \u2026 It does truly amazing things, and I\u2019m really excited to be able to fly it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The first two of an eventual 20 F-35 jets arrived Thursday at the Vermont Air National Guard base in South Burlington, the first Guard unit to receive the next-generation fighter.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Wilson Ring"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/National_Guard_F-35s_26248.jpg-b4eae_c0-57-3119-1875_s1770x1032.jpg?0c9d72dea819b8d072412eaa0be12f6ac926203e", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
