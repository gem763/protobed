UPDATE 7-Oil eases on concerns over U.S.-China talks, weak economic data\n\n* Brent and WTI's early gains reversed\n\n* Iraq and Ecuador unrest offers some price support\n\n* Unrest in Iraq continues\n\n* Growing recession risk caps oil upside -analyst\n\n\n\n(Adds comments, data, updates prices, changes dateline to NEW\n\nYORK; previous LONDON)\n\nBy Devika Krishna Kumar\n\nNEW YORK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices slid on Tuesday as\n\nWashington's blacklisting of more Chinese companies dampened\n\nhopes for a trade deal between the two countries, though unrest\n\nin Iraq and Ecuador lent some support to crude prices.\n\nBoth Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate (WTI)\n\ncrude had risen by more than 1% earlier in the day, but\n\nby 10:59 a.m. ET (1459 GMT) Brent was down 8 cents, or 0.1%, at\n\n$58.27 a barrel and WTI was down 17 cents, or 0.3%, at\n\n$52.58.\n\nInvestors are treading cautiously before U.S.-China trade\n\ntalks in Washington on Thursday, though prospects for progress\n\ndimmed after U.S. President Donald Trump said a quick trade deal\n\nwas unlikely.\n\nWashington is also moving ahead with discussions over\n\npossible restrictions on capital flows into China, with a focus\n\non investments by U.S. government pension funds, Bloomberg\n\nreported. \"The (energy) complex will be forced to focus more\n\nsuccinctly on global oil demand deterioration as it negotiates\n\nthrough the monthly series of Agency reports the rest of this\n\nweek,\" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates,\n\nsaid in a note.\n\n\"We are not ruling out a quick upward price reversal as\n\ncomments out of the White House as well as China will be seeing\n\nincreasing frequency with both Countries attempting to preclude\n\nany developments that might force further downward adjustments\n\nin the global economic growth path.\"\n\nOil prices were also pressured by weak economic data after\n\nU.S. producer prices fell unexpectedly in September, weighed\n\ndown by lower costs of goods and services, which could give the\n\nFederal Reserve room to cut interest rates again this month. U.S. stocks fell more than 1% on Tuesday and the\n\npan-European STOXX 600 index snapped a two-day winning\n\nstreak to lose 1%. \"The market's focus remains on trade tensions and oil demand\n\nconcerns, ignoring the elevated geopolitical tensions in the\n\nMiddle East and lower OPEC production in September,\" said UBS\n\noil analyst Giovanni Staunovo.\n\n\"Growing recession risks have capped the upside of oil\n\nprices.\"\n\nCrude inventories in the United States are expected to have\n\ngrown for a fourth week while distillates and gasoline stocks\n\nare also likely to have fallen, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.\n\nHowever, protests in OPEC members Iraq and Ecuador\n\nthreatened to disrupt their oil output and supported prices.\n\nIn Iraq, protests resumed overnight in Baghdad's Sadr City\n\ndistrict, though much of the country appeared quieter than it\n\nhas been for a week.\n\n\"Unrest in Iraq gained a high profile at the start of\n\nOctober as a result of large protests in Baghdad,\" RBC analyst\n\nAl Stanton said.\n\nHe said potential attacks by Turkey on Kurdish forces in\n\nnortheast Syria could take place close to the Iraqi border,\n\nleading to \"a refugee crisis that puts pressures on Kurdistan's\n\neconomy\" and its oil production.\n\nTurkey said it had completed preparations for a military\n\noperation in northeast Syria after the United States began\n\npulling back troops.\n\nEcuador's energy ministry said protests against austerity\n\ncould reduce its oil output by 59,450 barrels per\n\nday.\n\nSaudi Arabia reiterated on Tuesday that it was ready to meet\n\nglobal oil needs. Installations belonging to Saudi Aramco were\n\nattacked on Sept. 14, hitting output and triggering a spike in\n\noil prices.\n\n\n\nMajor Oil Supply Diruptions png https://tmsnrt.rs/2nkroOv\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 7-Oil eases on concerns over U.S.-China talks, weak economic data", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC7N12U_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
