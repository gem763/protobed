Those present will be checked for electronic devices to make sure there are no images or sound recordings of the exhumation.\n\nLast Saturday, a journalist dressed as a monk and equipped with a climbing harness was arrested at the valley, allegedly while trying to gain access to the site to set up cameras.\n\nOnce the heavy slab has been lifted using hydraulic jacks, the wooden coffin will be inspected to see how well it has endured 44 years of burial and checked for possible water damage. The coffin was surrounded with lead and concrete to protect it against underground streams.\n\nFranco\u2019s body is further protected by a zinc box within the coffin, which is expected to be in good condition. If necessary, the zinc box containing the remains will be placed in a new coffin.\n\nThe exhumation phase could take between one and three hours, after which the remains will be blessed by the prior, Santiago Cantera, and the coffin carried out of the basilica by family members.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Valley of the Fallen.

Airspace over the route will be closed to traffic and drones.\n\nIf it is too foggy or windy, the coffin will be driven in a hearse, which could take 40 minutes.\n\nA private family service will be held inside the Franco mausoleum, where the dictator\u2019s widow, Carmen Polo, was buried after her death in 1988. At the family\u2019s request, mass will be said by Ram\u00f3n Tejero.\n\nThe priest is the son of Antonio Tejero, the Guardia Civil lieutenant colonel who led the failed 1981 military coup that sought to seize control of the country after its return to democracy following Franco\u2019s death.\n\nAccording to the government, the exhumation and reinterment will cost about \u20ac63,000 (\u00a354,000).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Francisco Franco, centre, gives a salute.

Spain is believed to have more mass graves than any country except Cambodia.\n\nThe Valley of the Fallen, partly built by the forced labour of political prisoners, is Spain\u2019s largest mass grave and holds the bodies of more than 33,000 people from both sides of the civil war.\n\nIn July last year, the Spanish government announced plans to establish a truth commission to investigate crimes against humanity committed by the Franco regime.\n\nThe government, led by the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said it would compile a census of the victims of the civil war and the ensuing dictatorship, and also open an estimated 1,200 mass graves.", "description": "Dictator\u2019s tomb to be opened and coffin taken to cemetery near Madrid on Thursday", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48cd50c16fe3db232ffa64a05c56f2ac9607c296/0_866_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=678fe90090dde83da1628dae1dd8332c", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
