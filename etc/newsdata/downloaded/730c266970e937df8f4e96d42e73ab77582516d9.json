Both players were assessed personal fouls, but neither was ejected. (Nick Wass, File)\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens\u2019 typically strong defense failed to offer much resistance in its 40-25 loss to the Cleveland Browns\u2019 Sunday \u2014 except for one notable play in which cornerback Marlon Humphrey appeared to choke Odell Beckham Jr. during the second half.\n\nThe Browns were livid and Humphrey apologized to Beckham for his behavior.\n\nWatch as Marlon Humphrey (#RavensFlock ) choke slams OBJ (#Browns ) and keeps his hands around his throat! pic.twitter.com/tIBC4uE22v \u2014 History of Sports (@BeforeFamePics) September 29, 2019\n\nOn Tuesday, the Ravens\u2019 team website published its interpretation of events, which, if you can believe it, sided with Humphrey.\n\nIn a blog post titled \u201cMarlon Humphrey Didn\u2019t Choke Odell Beckham Jr.,\u201d author Ryan Mink offered a play-by-play analysis of the scuffle and asserted his team\u2019s cornerback did nothing more than hold onto Beckham\u2019s jersey to protect himself. It was the Browns\u2019 star wide receiver, he says, who \u201cdefinitely punched\u201d Humphrey.\n\nHe further argued tempers flared because of how effectively Humphrey had defended Beckham, who had gone without a catch to that point.\n\nReporters for team sites don\u2019t necessarily speak for the franchise\u2019s key figures at all times \u2014 though they are employed by the team, and the Ravens\u2019 official Twitter page promoted the post as if it uncovered the Zapruder film of the Humphrey-Beckham scuffle.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about the play between Marlon Humphrey and Odell Beckham Jr.\n\n\n\nClose-up video shows exactly what happened, and that Humphrey didn\u2019t choke him.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf0: https://t.co/mdpmljNMxl pic.twitter.com/AO9KAfCW6a \u2014 Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) October 1, 2019\n\nOn Sunday, Browns Coach Freddie Kitchens vowed to escalate the case to Al Riveron, the NFL\u2019s senior vice president of officiating. ESPN on Tuesday confirmed Kitchens had contacted the league about the alleged choking incident.\n\nBoth players received offsetting penalties after the fight and were allowed to continue playing. It\u2019s not clear if there will be any further discipline as a result.\n\nAsked about the Ravens\u2019 defense of their player Tuesday, Kitchens answered rhetorically.\n\n[Baker Mayfield vs. Rex Ryan might be the NFL season\u2019s most fun, unexpected battle]\n\n\u201cDid you see the video?\u201d he said to ESPN. \u201cThat\u2019s my response. Everybody saw the video.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Kitchens expressed himself much more fiercely.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s my big deal with that: I just want to have consistency on how we\u2019re going to deal with things, okay?\u201d Kitchens reportedly said during a Monday conference call. \u201cI don\u2019t like seeing our player on the field and someone\u2019s hands around his throat. I don\u2019t like that. I don\u2019t think that needs to be in our game, and I would be the first to say that if it was our guy doing it.\u201d\n\nThe back-and-forth between Baltimore and Cleveland follows a Sunday filled with tension in the NFL. Oakland Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict was suspended for the rest of the season for a helmet-to-helmet hit on Indianapolis Colts tight end Jack Doyle. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen was placed in concussion protocol after a helmet-to-helmet hit from Patriots\u2019 defensive back Jonathan Jones.\n\nFollowing their loss to New England, Bills Coach Sean McDermott wondered why Jones wasn\u2019t ejected for the play.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no room in football for that,\u201d McDermott told reporters. \u201cI thought he should have been thrown out. But other than that, I\u2019m not going to get into that. That\u2019s for the league to get into.\u201d\n\nJones argued the hit was a football play, which he carried out with \u201cno malice or intent.\u201d\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nThe Browns kept the Ravens from running away with the AFC North\n\nThis NFL season has been filled with injuries and controversies.
