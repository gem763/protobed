But not all. There's a step to lower drug prices that a Democratic president could take even without Congress.\n\nThe move involves invoking an obscure section of a 1980 law to break the patent on a drug when it is priced too high. The idea, known as \"march-in rights,\" would allow the government to \"march in\" and break a patent to allow a cheaper version of a drug to be made by another company.\n\nThe move has long been controversial and the authority to use it has never been invoked before. But Democratic presidential candidates are increasingly embracing the idea.\n\nWho's for it: Sens.

While Trump has railed against high drug prices and proposed some steps to address the issue, he has yet to oversee any major action that has gone on to lower prices.\n\nRead more here.\n\nTrump officials move to ease doctor anti-fraud rules in modernization bid\n\nToday in wonky but potentially important news:\n\nThe Trump administration announced proposed changes to ease regulations targeting fraud by doctors in what it says is an effort to remove barriers to some legitimate innovative payment arrangements.\n\nThe proposed rules would create certain exceptions to regulations around two laws, the Physician Self-Referral Law and the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Those laws are intended to prevent doctors from referring patients for services that would financially benefit them, or taking bribes to generate new business.\n\nBut the administration argues those rules can sometimes have unintended consequences by blocking some legitimate payment arrangements as well.\n\nThe very technical changes in the new proposed rules would create exceptions that allow for \"value-based\" payment arrangements, which is where doctors get paid more if their patients get better results. Officials say there would still be rules against actual fraud.\n\nThe politics: Be prepared for lots of health care announcements! The Trump administration is trying to keep up a drumbeat of health care announcements as it seeks to show progress on an issue that Democrats used to great political advantage in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nRead more here.\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nThis is the strongest argument against Medicare for All (New York Times opinion)\n\nBennet hits Warren on cost of Medicare for All (WMUR)\n\nAmericans now spend twice as much on health care as they did in the 1980s (CNBC)\n\nState by state\n\nFederal court to hear arguments in case over Kentucky's Medicaid work requirements plan (Louisville Courier-Journal)\n\nNew state database helps patients figure out health care costs (Connecticut Public Radio)\n\nThe Hill op-ed\n\n2019 flu season will be deadlier -- here's why", "description": "Welcome to Wednesday's Overnight Health Care.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/plannedparenthood_protesters_053119getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
