But it\u2019s not yet clear whether she can win over skeptical progressives.\n\nThe California Democrat has won initial praise from key moderate factions in her drive to push the legislation through by Thanksgiving. But the ambitious plan, and its closed-door drafting process, has left progressives worried that the bill will fall well short of their expectations and that they remain cut out of the talks.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe backlash from the left complicates a key moment for Pelosi \u2014 who won back the House after the party zeroed in on health care during the 2018 midterms but has achieved relatively little on curbing sky-high drug costs in the first nine months of the majority.\n\n\u201cSome will hail. And others will call it hell,\u201d said Rep. Anna Eshoo, chair of the Energy and Commerce Health subcommittee, after a closed-door meeting on the bill.\n\nDemocrats are set to unveil the bill Thursday, capping months of work on what many consider the caucus\u2019 legislative centerpiece \u2014 even as few outside of Pelosi\u2019s tight circle have seen it in full.\n\nThe frustration on the left has been building for months, in part aimed at one of Pelosi\u2019s longtime health advisers Wendell Primus, whom one progressive leader derided as \u201cRepresentative Wendell\u201d for his dominant role in drafting the plan.\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) on Wednesday walked out of a meeting with House Energy and Commerce leaders, after complaining that she had not seen key details and still had more questions, according to two people in the room.\n\nPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

John Dingell.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a warning sign for Pelosi and other top Democrats as they look to notch a big legislative win by year\u2019s end. If the party can\u2019t fulfill a top campaign promise, it could threaten the freshman Democrats who flipped seats and delivered the House in 2018.\n\n\u201cShe knows where it is in the polls,\u201d said Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.), who has served with Pelosi for 20 years in the House. \u201cI think anytime she sets her mind to do something \u2014 she knows how to work the caucus as well as everyone.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats already passed one health care package in May that would restrict anti-competitive behaviors by pharmaceutical companies and reverse Trump administration policies designed to undermine the Affordable Care Act. And many in the caucus are eager to do more.\n\nOther Democrats have emerged from private briefings on the bill this week with confidence that the House could approve drug pricing legislation this fall, though many said they would reserve their final judgement on Pelosi's plan until details emerged.\n\nIn separate meetings with the Blue Dog Coalition and New Democrats this week, lawmakers raised concerns with relatively technical aspects of the legislation, rather than major substantive issues, according to multiple lawmakers and aides in the room. The speaker will meet with the Congressional Progressive Caucus on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of momentum behind this,\u201d Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said. \u201cIt\u2019s big. When you get into the details, obviously it can be difficult.\u201d\n\nBut the secretive process has frustrated Democrats across the spectrum and left both progressives and otherwise supportive centrist members skeptical of leadership\u2019s case for speeding the drug plan through as soon as October. Some liberal lawmakers have privately vented in recent weeks that Pelosi was preparing to jam them on a key priority \u2014 forcing members to effectively pass her favored bill or risk going home empty handed.\n\nIndeed, the legislation fails to meet a series of demands that progressives have made for months \u2014 namely that it authorize federal officials to directly negotiate the price for at least 250 drugs. The bill instead will require negotiations for 25 drugs per year, with a maximum of 250, according to lawmakers and aides.\n\nThat provision has been one of the biggest concerns for progressives, multiple lawmakers said, and was one of the focal points in the Energy and Commerce Committee's briefing on Wednesday. Pelosi and her staff have said in response that requiring negotiations for 250 drugs would have been nearly impossible to achieve.\n\nThe bill may also violate a second requirement for liberal lawmakers that it allow for immediate limits on the price of newly launched medicines.\n\nHouse leadership, meanwhile, has largely dismissed competing legislation already endorsed by progressives that would take a harder line with the drug industry, worrying it would hurt innovation and run into a series of legal hurdles.\n\nPelosi and her team did make a key change to appease progressives: dropping a contentious provision on arbitration that liberals called a nonstarter.\n\nThe CPC has blasted leadership for writing the bill in secret and pulling back its ambitions \u2014 contending that Democrats shouldn't \"negotiate against themselves\" and water down the bill in hopes of attracting support from Senate Republicans or President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a public missive sent to Pelosi in August, five CPC members led by its co-chairs Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) warned the coalition may not support legislation that fails to meet its standards.\n\n\u201cOur position has not changed a millimeter,\u201d said Pocan, who gave Primus the nickname. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants to go back home and say we\u2019re negotiating for 25 drugs. It\u2019s gotta be something more substantive.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Pro Cannabis High-quality coverage of one of the fastest growing industries in the country. Sign up for a free preview.

It should be something that can be signed into law.\n\n\u201cMy worry is that it may be something that does not attract Republican support, which means it\u2019s dead on arrival in the Senate,\u201d said Rep. Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.), a freshman who won a Trump-backed district in part by campaigning on health care.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that, although a lot has been accomplished in the House, a lot of it may not see the light in Senate, so we have to really focus our attention over the next year and a half on what can actually get passed and signed into law,\u201d he added.\n\nTop Democrats stressed that the legislation could still change as it winds through committee, and they emphasized that passing a drug negotiation bill is a must for the caucus to be able to proclaim a successful first year in power.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone can go home and say, \u2018You know what, it was so hard to do that. I can\u2019t lower the price of prescription drugs for you,\u2019\u201d Eshoo said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that that\u2019s a take-home item.\u201d\n\nEshoo\u2019s subcommittee is planning a legislative hearing on the bill next Wednesday, with sessions in the Ways and Means and Education and Labor panels likely to follow in the next few weeks. Top Democrats are targeting a floor vote as soon as the end of October.\n\nIn addition to authorizing direct negotiation of drug prices, the bill would allow the government to slap a hefty tax on drug makers that refuse to cooperate.\n\nThe legislation also incorporates a measure tying the maximum price of drugs under negotiation to the often lower prices that are charged abroad.\n\nThat so-called reference pricing concept \u2014 which is favored by liberals like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 appears aimed directly at winning over Trump, who has embraced a similar approach in a sharp break with GOP orthodoxy.\n\nThe legislation also sets a first-ever $2,000 cap on what seniors must pay out of pocket for their drugs under Medicare Part D, a broadly popular move that\u2019s become a priority for Republicans and Democrats over the past year.\n\n\u201cI think everybody has an appetite to dig in,\u201d said Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.), chairman of the New Democrat Coalition. \u201cThis is something in red districts, purple districts, blue districts, we all hear about it from our constituents.\u201d\n\nSarah Owermohle contributed to this report.", "description": "The speaker is running into resistance on the left on a top priority for the party.", "authors": ["Sarah Ferris", "Adam Cancryn", "Sarah Karlin-Smith"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/df/29/9ea2eaba4475af535c0aa130f06f/19918-nancy-pelosi-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
