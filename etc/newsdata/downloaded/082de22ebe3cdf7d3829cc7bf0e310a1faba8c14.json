The company continues to engage with the shareholders on IPO readiness activities. The company is ready and timing will depend on market conditions and be at a time of the shareholders\u2019 choosing.\u201d\n\nThe people declined to be identified due to commercial sensitivities.\n\nThe company will soon have more shareholders from institutions, the head of the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, Yassir al-Rumayyan, said.\n\nAl-Rumayyan, governor of the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and chairman of Aramco\u2019s board of directors, was speaking at a panel at the conference in Riyadh.\n\nAramco will start subscription for investors in its initial public offering on Dec. 4, Saudi-owned news channel Al-Arabiya said in a news flash on Tuesday citing sources.\n\nThe oil giant plans to announce the transaction\u2019s price on Nov. 17, it added. The company will begin trading on the local stock market, the Tadawul, on Dec. 11, the broadcaster reported.\n\nThe prospect of Aramco selling a piece of itself has had Wall Street on tenterhooks since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first flagged it three years ago.\n\nHowever, his desired $2 trillion valuation has always been questioned by some financiers and industry experts, who note that countries have been accelerating efforts to shift away from fossil fuels to curb global warming, putting oil prices under pressure and undermining producers\u2019 equity value.\n\nRussia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), is working on a consortium of investors for Aramco\u2019s IPO, its chief executive said.\n\n\u201cThere are several Russian pensions funds who are interested to invest in the Aramco IPO and we have also received indications from our Russia-China fund of some Chinese major institutions also interested in Aramco IPO,\u201d Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) head Kirill Dmitriev told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nSeparately, Aramco has not approached the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) to invest in the IPO, the sovereign wealth fund\u2019s managing director Farouk Bastaki said on Tuesday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Saudi Aramco logo pictured at the company's oil facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia, October 12, 2019.
