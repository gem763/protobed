I always thought that going forward you would have an economic core which would revolve around Germany \u2013 the main economic powerhouse in the eurozone \u2013 and then it made sense to have a defence and security core that Britain would lead.\u201d\n\nIn his speech today, Mr Umunna will say that his own mixed English, Irish and Nigerian heritage is an example of the \u201cliberal, open, internationalist spirit\u201d which Lib Dems cherish.\n\nHe will say that his new party \u201cexists to build and defend a fair, free and open society\u201d and to fight for the rights of those from all backgrounds to live together in peace.\n\nIn a swipe at Mr Johnson\u2019s suggestion that he might not obey anti-no-deal legislation and Tory jibes at judges, Mr Umunna will say that Lib Dems demand that governments \u201crespect the rule of law with an independent judiciary ... free from abuse and attack by the executive\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is the Britain we know and love, and Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and the other peddlers of hate and division had better know that this is what we will fight for at the coming election,\u201d he will say.\n\n\u201cIt is our job to make sure this country\u2019s heartbeat is liberal and internationalist, not nationalist, populist and authoritarian. It is the new fault line in British politics and we know where we stand.\u201d\n\nMr Umunna will say that, under Mr Corbyn, his old party Labour \u201cis not the party of Attlee and Bevin\u201d.\n\nLabour cannot claim to be a \u201cchampion of liberalism\u201d so long as it is under investigation over antisemitism and when activists feel able to \u201cabuse, vilify and deselect\u201d critics of the leader, he will say.\n\nAnd he will accuse Mr Corbyn of being an \u201capologist\u201d for Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and lauding authoritarian regimes in Iran and Venezuela while seeking to abolish Nato.\n\n\u201cWhat unites both Johnson and Corbyn is the fact that both want to leave the EU, this biggest champion of liberalism in our neighbourhood,\u201d he will say.\n\n\u201cNeither is fit to lead this country. It\u2019s time for a change and someone I know can provide that leadership \u2013 Jo Swinson.\u201d\n\nElsewhere at the Bournemouth conference, Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Sir Ed Davey will commit the party to introducing a \u201cwellbeing budget\u201d to help the most vulnerable in society, as well as a \u201cclimate emergency budget\u201d to support the drive to decarbonise capitalism.", "description": "Liberal Democrats should take Britain back into the EU if Brexit goes ahead, the party\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson\u00a0Chuka Umunna has said.
