Reports suggest that Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyto try and dig up dirt on his potential 2020 opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump critics pounced on the report as being potentially fatal to his administration. But Giuliani saw a positive takeaway from the headlines: If the media keeps hammering Trump about Ukraine, it will only put a brighter spotlight on Biden and his own Ukrainian scandal. Reportedly, Ukraine gave millions to Biden's son Hunter Biden via some \"corrupt companies.\"\n\nDid Obama know that his VP, the one he put in charge of giving billions to Ukraine, had a son who was making millions on the board of one of the most corrupt companies in Ukraine. Biden\u2019s boss had stolen $5b from Ukraine and was a fugitive. Did Obama know? Did he approve? \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) September 23, 2019\n\n\"You start asking Biden, he\u2019s going to fall apart,\" Giuliani predicted on Fox Business.\n\nGiuliani invited the media to go ahead and keep reporting on it because Trump will once again effectively \"deflect the punch.\"\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot more evidence I\u2019m going to put out,\" the attorney promised.\n\nAs for whether Trump should respond to demands to send material to House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), Giuliani said absolutely not, especially after Schiff argued that the Ukraine report may be grounds for impeachment.\n\n\"Make it hard on these phonies,\" Giuliani said.\n\nThe attorney added that the Democrats need to investigate the Bidens instead. If they don't, there's no longer such a thing as \"justice.\"\n\nIf Dem party doesn\u2019t call for investigation of Bidens\u2019 millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it. Bidens\u2019 made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play? \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) September 23, 2019\n\nTrump has said there was nothing untoward about his conversations with President Zelenskyto, yet he'd consider releasing the transcripts from their phone call.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make a determination about how to release it, releasing it, saying what we said,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was an absolutely perfect conversation. The problem is, when you\u2019re speaking to foreign leaders, you don\u2019t want foreign leaders to feel that they shouldn\u2019t be speaking openly and good.\u201d", "description": ".09/23/2019 13:20:54PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/126/7a4eb490-3f4a-45c3-b321-7dc088c0168e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
