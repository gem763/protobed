But at its heart will lie this simple proposition: good democracy relies on good information.\n\nWhat does \u201cgood information\u201d look like? We might say: information that is not only true but also believed. And therein lies the problem. We\u2019re no longer very willing to believe almost anybody. Most surveys of trust find very little faith in what government or politicians tell us. But there are also extraordinarily low levels of trust in most media. Nearly two-thirds of people say they can no longer tell good journalism from rumour or falsehoods. This is, to put it mildly, a disaster. Into this vacuum of unbelief and mistrust step liars and peddlers of fantasies. By all means call another referendum or election, but what makes anyone confident that the electorate will make a \u201cbetter\u201d decision than last time round? And I don\u2019t just mean Brexit.\n\nIf you are going to put a crucial decision on the future of Britain to a vote of citizens it\u2019s pretty obvious what the proper function of the press should be: to arm them with unvarnished facts on both sides of the argument. We might add: don\u2019t pretend a complex question is a simple one. And: by all means tell us your own view, but save that until you\u2019ve given us the facts.\n\nEtonians, unironically, give a kicking to 'the elites' with a winking eye on next day\u2019s tabloid headlines\n\nFor the past four years \u2013 you might say much longer \u2013 this is not how much of the British press has behaved. Several newspapers have done the opposite. They pretended Europe was a really simple question. They did not bother to present both sides of the argument. And they appeared overwhelmingly keener on shouting their own views before presenting straight news.\n\nThe prime minister himself is at the heart of this story. His Brussels years of ever more inventive Euro \u201cscoops\u201d morphed into years as editor and columnist in the service of the tax-shy Barclay brothers. The Telegraph reciprocated by becoming Johnson\u2019s greatest cheerleader in his rhetoric-over-evidence rush to lead a do-or-die Brexit. Today it\u2019s often hard to tell whether he thinks he\u2019s dashing off a column or governing the country.\n\nBut there will, in time, be so much more to examine. The then proprietor of the Express, a former pornographer, writing a cheque for \u00a31m to Nigel Farage at the start of the referendum campaign \u2013 thereby effectively signalling the end of the Express as a newspaper. The Sun printing a BeLeave in Britain poster \u2013 and duly having to register it as a \u00a397,000 donation to the Leave campaign. Why should the public trust \u201cproper\u201d news when journalists turn propagandists?\n\nAnd then the bullying. The front-page exhortations to \u201ccrush the saboteurs\u201d, the denunciations of the \u201cenemies of the people\u201d and the Brexit mutineers. \u201cDissident\u201d MPs displayed like targets on front pages as though the murder of one of their colleagues counted for nothing. And, lately, the persistent anonymous feeding of anonymous No 10 titbits to journalists, who breathlessly rush them on to Twitter with barely a care as to whether they\u2019re actually true.\n\nWe could add the mirroring of the current crude demotic political discourse. Quentin Letts, moonlighting in the Sun when he is not entertaining Times readers, calls Lady Hale a \u201cbeady-eyed old nanny goat\u201d. Why?\n\nLetts went to a decent private school, attended two world-class universities and \u2013 when not putting the boot into people who do not conform with his own idea of what the establishment should look like \u2013 leads a bucolic life as a deputy church warden in Herefordshire. In the past such figures would have seen it as their role to help people without their privilege to become better informed. Now, Dacre-trained in attack dog menace, he pulls on his bovver boots and joins them.\n\nPosh boys being populist is one of the hallmarks of the current state we\u2019re in. Etonians, unironically, give a kicking to \u201cthe elites\u201d with a winking eye on next day\u2019s tabloid headlines. Oxford graduates sneer at experts. Dominic Cummings (private school and Oxford) holds most manifestations of post-Enlightenment values in contempt. Letts lets rip with his own form of class war.\n\nThe new elitism is a deadly form of condescension. Sun readers aren\u2019t there to be informed. Entertained, yes. Inflamed, yes. Infuriated: certainly. But not well informed.\n\nInterestingly, the Mail, under a new editor, is quietly turning itself into a much more nuanced paper, willing to do justice to more than one side of an argument. An editorial on Hale was notably reasonable \u2013 miles away from the finger-jabbing fury of the previous regime. Sales seem to be holding up just fine (and, I\u2019m told, more than 200 advertisers have returned).\n\nMost foot soldiers in journalism do the job because they absolutely believe in the role of good information in good democracies. Something is stopping them: and the sooner we can fix that the better.\n\nAlan Rusbridger, a former editor-in-chief of the Guardian, is principal of Lady Margaret Hall at Oxford and chairs the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism", "description": "Any vote on Britain\u2019s future relies on the press presenting people with plain facts", "authors": ["Alan Rusbridger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8a488d2e0bea7d573baa8db89188b473b493d4/0_182_5460_3276/master/5460.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1cdbf2667fb7e32c55e2e1e34da9d0c2", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
