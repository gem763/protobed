The claim is these \u201cshort sellers\u201d are betting on big falls in share prices and the value of sterling in what critics say is a classic example of \u201cdisaster capitalism\u201d. But how do they do it, who are they and are they all merchants of doom?\n\nTell me how shorting works\n\nThe conventional way to make money from shares is to buy at a low price then sell at a high price. It is called going long. Shorting is the opposite: buying high and selling low.\n\nThe approach of hedge funds is to target a share they believe is heading for a fall. But the only way to make a profit is by not really owning those shares in the first place, rather \u201cborrowing\u201d them. Typically, the hedge fund borrows them, at a small fee, from a pension fund that is holding them for the long term.\n\nThe investor (speculator is probably a better word) borrows, say, 10,000 BP shares and promises to return them at a fixed time \u2013 let\u2019s say in a month. The speculator instantly sells the BP shares at the going market price \u2013 say 500p, giving them \u00a350,000.\n\nIn a month\u2019s time, when they have to return the shares to the pension fund, the shares have fallen to, say, 400p. So the speculator goes into the market, buys 10,000 shares for \u00a340,000 and hands them back, making a profit of \u00a310,000 along the way. But if the shares have risen to 600p, they will make a loss of \u00a310,000.\n\nThe reality is rather more sophisticated than this \u2013 speculators rarely take actual delivery of shares, and use other methods such as CFDs (contracts for difference) and short ETFs (exchange traded funds) \u2013 but the principle is the same.\n\nSounds super. Should I try it?\n\nProbably not. The most you can lose when investing conventionally is the value of the share. In shorting, it\u2019s possible to lose more. If the share you are shorting soars in price then you have to go back into the market and pay for it \u2013 possibly much more than your original investment. It\u2019s one reason the Financial Conduct Authority is not especially keen on shorting among small investors.\n\nBut it\u2019s surprising how accessible shorting has become for retail investors. ETFs in particular are cheap to buy and easy to trade, such as those that promise to move higher every time the FTSE 100 index falls. For example, Legal & General has a FTSE 100 Super Short Strategy fund that gives you a 2% gain for every 1% fall in the FTSE 100, and is available for sale on Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s platform.\n\nSo who is really doing it?\n\nThe reality is that the big money from shorting is made by a relatively small club of extremely wealthy individuals. Every day, the FCA publishes a list of which shares are being shorted and who is doing the shorting. Shorttracker.co.uk also maintains a useful update. The same names crop up again and again \u2013 Marshall Wace, Odey Asset Management, GLG, AQR and BlackRock.\n\nMarshall Wace manages about $39bn (\u00a332bn) from its Mayfair HQ, and was founded by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace. In January, they penned an article for the Times (paywall) titled: \u201cLet\u2019s hurry up with Brexit: there will be benefits for all.\u201d\n\nCrispin Odey of Odey Asset Management has donated almost \u00a3900,000 to pro-Brexit campaigns, and also placed huge bets against the pound and government bonds in the run-up to the EU referendum. It is estimated he made a \u00a3220m profit when sterling collapsed after the leave victory.\n\nAre they counting on a hard Brexit?\n\nYes and no. Clearly some of the positions taken by Odey and Marshall Wace will pay off if there is a crash-out Brexit and UK-facing stocks are hit hard. Fund managers say the sectors most vulnerable to a no-deal Brexit are companies that make most of their profits in the UK rather than abroad \u2013 such as housebuilders and retailers \u2013 and Odey is in a lot of them.\n\nOdey has big short positions against Intu Properties, which runs 17 shopping centres across the UK, the retailer Debenhams, and the housebuilders Berkeley Group and Cairn Homes.\n\nBut he also has a big position against Lancashire Holdings, a London- and Bermuda-based insurer involved in aviation, energy and marine insurance. Another of his big shorts is in IG Group \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest providers of CFDs, the very instrument most used to carry out shorting.\n\nMarshall Wace has a broader spread of shorts, covering 41 companies in the UK and overseas. Broadly speaking, these are UK-facing with a likelihood of being damaged by Brexit, but Marshall Wace\u2019s shorts include Mexican gold producers and South African diamond mines.\n\nAre all the hedge fund shorters Brexiters?\n\nNot necessarily. Big institutions and pension funds also participate in shorting. For example, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is a big short seller, with currently large disclosed bets against Pearson, Balfour Beatty and Provident Financial.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nDo you have to have an address in Mayfair?\n\nHedge funds prefer the West End of London rather than the City or Canary Wharf, reflecting their super-rich clients. Marshall Wace\u2019s head office is on Sloane Street in Chelsea, while Odey\u2019s office in Mayfair is a short stroll from the Dorchester hotel. In the US, they seem to cluster around Greenwich, Connecticut, a super-rich enclave just outside New York.\n\nDo they all make gazillions?\n\nMany hedge funds made a fortune when Thomas Cook went under. But a lot of them are not very good at it. When working for other investors, they tend to charge 2% upfront plus 20% of any gain, but on average produce poor returns. According to Bloomberg, the hedge fund industry gave investors a 4.1% loss in 2018, although an Odey fund was top of the table with a 53% gain.", "description": "Philip Hammond says Boris Johnson\u2019s rich backers are line to make a killing", "authors": ["Patrick Collinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2522a22a7beb6728c5beec63b4e9c04455fd9f65/873_1821_1325_796/master/1325.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=da831b422e3b9c56e98ac61bd6e7e983", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
