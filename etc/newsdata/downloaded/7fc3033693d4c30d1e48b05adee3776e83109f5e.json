Konta was attempting to become the first British woman to reach the semi-finals at Flushing Meadows since Jo Durie in 1983, but she fell short against a familiar foe, fifth seed Svitolina extending her 100 per cent record against Konta to five matches, 6-4 6-4 in an hour and 40 minutes.\n\nKonta has been streets ahead of the rest of the field with the amount of winners she has hit this tournament, and she had another 24 here, but that was offset by an unforced error count of 35, compared to just 13 from the metronomic Svitolina.\n\nThe Ukrainian made the first breakthrough in a hard-fought fifth game, Konta eventually succumbing with a backhand into the net. Konta, with actor Tom Hiddleston watching from her box again, broke straight back. But she then promptly gave away break point with a misguided drop shot and Svitolina pounced again, arrowing a backhand into the corner.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Another unforced error handed Svitolina a break for 3-2 in the second as a Konta forehand drifted wide.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

hit back for 3-3, a stunning drop shot flopping over the net just out of Svitolina\u2019s reach, only to then find herself at 0-40, and when a volley fell short she was passed and broken once more.\n\nKonta faced two match points on her own serve, and gamely saved both to force the ball back into Svitolina\u2019s hand. But Svitolina converted number three to make it back-to-back major semi-final appearances for her, having also reached the last four at Wimbledon.\n\nThe 24-year-old said: \u201cI think we were both striking the ball well, it was quite even, I\u2019m just very happy with the way I handled the pressure. I was just taking one point at a time and trying to stay calm.\n\n\u201cFor all the Ukrainians it is not so easy when you are growing up, you don\u2019t have much opportunity to travel and that\u2019s why we are so determined when we get them.\u201d", "description": "Johanna Konta\u2019s bid for US Open glory was ended in the quarter-finals by Elina Svitolina.
