Strong satraps tend to make elections presidential and Mamata \u201cDidi\u201d Banerjee runs her party and state with an iron hand. The Lok Sabha elections have shown the BJP draw nearly level with TMC but the assembly elections could be a different ball game.\n\nTrinamool can be expected to make the contest about Mamata, her clean image, her fighting qualities and Bengali identity. Even the Left and Congress may pitch in to help. Who better than Sourav \u201cDada\u201d Ganguly to meet fire with fire? By teaching a talented Indian side that punched much below its weight in world cricket to confidently and aggressively take on the imperious Aussie side of the day, Saurav went far beyond carving his name in the annals of Indian cricket.\n\nFor many Indians, the brash confident skipper was also a metaphor for India\u2019s arrival on the world stage. It\u2019s economy had just begun to boom and India\u2019s potential to join the other Asian tigers was the new buzz in the air. With the likes of MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli carrying on from where Sourav left, Bengal\u2019s most successful cricketer may have receded just a little bit from the national psyche. Yet in his home state he remains a brand and it is possible that BJP is looking to exploit that popularity.\n\nThe manner in which Amit Shah intervened in the post-CoA transitition in BCCI and Ganguly emerged as board president has given wind to the rumours. Mamata was quick to congratulate Ganguly but many would have licked their lips in anticipation of a cracker of a battle that could be in the offing in Bengal. Unlike Congress, there are few parallels in BJP of a rank outsider being paratrooped to lead the battle for the party but today\u2019s BJP has confidently pulled off far bigger feats amid challenging odds.\n\nThe Sangh\u2019s foot soldiers and the backroom boys like Kailash Vijayvargiya and Mukul Roy have done all the spade work. Does the BJP need a general of Bengali vintage to mount the final assault or will it be the Modi-Shah duo that leads the Parivar into battle against one of the last holdouts?", "description": "Speculation is hotting up that Sourav Ganguly could become the much needed face BJP needs in Bengal before it mounts the final onslaught on Trinamool Congress in the assembly elections coming up in 2021.
