ASAN has accused Autism Speaks of using \u201clanguage of acceptance and understanding to push resources that further stigmatize and treat autistic people as burdens on our families.\u201d It contends that resource materials from Autism Speaks encourage parents \u201cto view autism as a terrible disease from which their child can \u2018get better.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI think part of why people feel so let down right now is that \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 as a show, is very, very personal to a lot of our members and a lot of people in the autistic community,\u201d said Julia Bascom, an autistic self-advocate and executive director of ASAN, explaining that many autistic people have relied on the show as a learning tool.\n\nAutism Speaks denied ASAN\u2019s characterization of its approach, or resource materials. Lisa Goring, Autism Speaks\u2019s chief strategic initiatives and innovation officer, said the group\u2019s job \u201cis to empower families with the information they need so their child can be successful.\u201d\n\nJeanette Betancourt, senior vice president of U.S. social impact at Sesame Workshop, said Sesame is \u201csaddened\u201d ASAN has ended its relationship with the children\u2019s program as it has been \u201cincredibly supportive of our efforts along the way and of contributing to Julia.\u201d\n\nThe controversy touched a nerve for many autistic adults who say they grew up being taught to conform to the world, rather than being encouraged to find their place in it.\n\nMany of today\u2019s self-advocates were children when autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was being described by some researchers and educators as an \u201cepidemic,\u201d scaring parents, some of whom accepted fraudulent claims that it was caused by vaccines and pursued physically and emotionally painful therapies promising a cure.\n\nSome children with autism were trained to behave more like other children \u2014 told to make eye contact, mimic common facial expressions and suppress repetitive behaviors called stimming, such as hand-flapping, bouncing and toe-tapping. They say it induced anxiety and made them believe there was something wrong with them.\n\nSome were put on special diets and treated for heavy metal poisoning, without evidence the unpleasant and potentially dangerous treatments had anything to do with autism.\n\nSome were forced to drink bleach \u2014 a quack treatment the Food and Drug Administration warned against last month.\n\nNow, this rising generation of autistic adults is joining others in the movement to change autism discussions that, they say, have historically been \u201cabout us, without us.\u201d More and more, they are influencing policies, leading protests against misleading anti-vaccine messages and the marketing of quack treatments, pushing for fair representation in media coverage, movies and TV shows, such as \u201cSesame Street,\u201d and helping to reshape language and outdated opinions about what autism really means. (For example, many self-advocates ask to be called \u201cautistic people\u201d rather than \u201cpeople with autism\u201d because the latter implies a disability.)\n\nMore and more autistic people, such as 16-year-old climate change activist Greta Thunberg, are taking pride in their identities. This month, she called autism her \u201csuperpower.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot more of us who are openly autistic and open about our opinions about the direction of autism research and services,\u201d said Ari Ne\u2019eman, an autistic adult who co-founded ASAN.\n\n\u201cThe movement has a tremendous amount of visibility and legitimacy now,\u201d Ne\u2019eman said. \u201cIt is no longer as terrifying, or revolutionary, a thing as it once was to simply be open about the fact that you\u2019re an autistic adult.\u201d\n\nOne leader in the movement, Lydia X.Z. Brown, an autistic attorney based in the Washington area and founder of the Autistic People of Color Fund, grew up at the height of the autism panic. Brown, who prefers the pronouns \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d said they were diagnosed as autistic at 13 \u2014 the year ASAN was campaigning against advertising that used ransom notes to portray autism as an abductor stealing children.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things I remember being told was that it would be a bad idea to tell other kids at school because then they just might bully me more,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSo for a couple of years there, I internalized the most pervasive messages about autism and really all disabilities.\u201d\n\nMany autistic adults, even those who went undiagnosed for years, say they, too, grew up feeling alone and forced to conform to societal expectations.\n\nJillian Parramore, an autistic person in California, said she was diagnosed with autism when she was 4 and began therapies. One of the most common, Applied Behavior Analysis, is stigmatizing and traumatizing, self-advocates say, because it teaches autistic people to mimic neurotypical behaviors that are not natural to them. Parramore said providers would come into her preschool class to teach her how to \u201cwalk and talk and breathe like a human \u2014 one that they understood to be human.\"\n\nParramore, who did not fully speak until she was 10, said trainers would also force her to practice facial expressions in the mirror to convey emotions, saying, \u201cshow me happy, show me sad, show me angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo this day, I get really freaked out when I see a mirror in public because I immediately want to go through the facial expressions,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve even learned to put on lipstick without a mirror because it\u2019s too much for me.\u201d\n\nSelf-advocates in this rising generation say that they have found their community online \u2014 many using the hashtag #ActuallyAutistic to share such experiences, insights and frustrations, to make friends and to fight for change.\n\nRebecca Long, an autistic person from North Carolina who also prefers the pronouns \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d said they were not diagnosed until age 18, \u201cso it took me a while to find autistic spaces.\"\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really connect with other autistic people, except for online,\u201d Long said. \u201cI started finding other people who had some of the same experiences as me. And for a while, I thought of it as an experiment: If I was actually autistic and I acted autistically \u2014 maybe I stimmed, maybe I did something else \u2014 how did that make me feel? Did that make me feel more comfortable? And now it\u2019s something that is much more comfortable to me.\u201d\n\nSteve Silberman, author of \u201cNeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity,\u201d said this \u201crise in popularity of social media has also raised the profile of the autistic self-advocacy movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can have a protest and we can have petitions signed and never leave our homes, which a lot of us have trouble doing,\u201d Parramore said.\n\nThey advocate for services and support like occupational therapy, speech pathology, and augmentative and alternative communication, especially for those who are nonverbal or need assistance communicating. They also want better inclusion in schools and greater availability of supportive therapies in the general community.\n\n\u201cWe are a generation that has experienced the harms of having autism policy research and services being something about us, without us, and we have sought to take our rightful place in the national conversation on autism with the goal of ensuring future generations will not have to go through what we had to go through,\u201d said Ne\u2019eman, who served as one of President Barack Obama\u2019s appointees to the National Council on Disability.\n\nMany self-advocates credit autism-rights activist Jim Sinclair for starting the movement, with a pointed open letter to parents in 1993 that criticized the culture surrounding autism and the emphasis on a \u201ccure.\u201d\n\nThe essay, \u201cDon\u2019t Mourn for Us,\u201d steered the conversation from grieving parents to their children: \u201cWe need and deserve families who can see us and value us for ourselves, not families whose vision of us is obscured by the ghosts of children who never lived.\n\n\u201cGrieve if you must, for your own lost dreams. But don\u2019t mourn for us. We are alive. We are real. And we\u2019re here waiting for you.\u201d\n\nSelf-advocates say Sinclair\u2019s words planted a seed for what has become a worldwide movement advocating for neurodiversity.\n\nJohn Elder Robison, an autistic person and neurodiversity scholar at the College of William & Mary, said it is important for autistic people to speak for the community, including those with intense support needs, to \u201cshow the world that we have voices.\u201d He added, \u201cBy speaking for ourselves, we assert our essential humanity and human rights.\u201d\n\nWhat do autistic people want to say about autism?\n\n\u201cThat the stereotype of autistic people being emotionless has done a lot of damage, that autistic people actually feel emotions really deeply and can feel a lot of empathy \u2014 maybe more empathy than a neurotypical \u2014 and that many of us grew up feeling excluded and were very aware that we\u2019re not always welcome,\u201d Long said.\n\n\u201cThat it\u2019s not a tragedy and that we\u2019re not a burden,\u201d said Courtney Johnson, an autistic person from Tennessee. \u201cWe just want to be loved and to be able to enjoy and experience life like anybody else. We\u2019re not defective, we\u2019re not broken, we\u2019re just us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all; it\u2019s a spectrum. And that spectrum creates that beautiful neurodiversity that should be celebrated,\u201d Parramore said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t a negative. We have so much to offer \u2014 if somebody just said, \u2018What do you want to say?\u2019 \u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Lindsey Bever", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/04-07-2017/t_1491600749116_name_juliavideograbsesamestreet.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
