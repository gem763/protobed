A Washington Post analysis noted at the time that Miriam Adelson\u2019s medal reflected \u201ca growing pattern: one of Trump awarding a large majority of such medals and even pardons to supporters, to Republicans, and to recipients who fit his political agenda.\u201d\n\nThe argument was bolstered in June when the president bestowed the same honor upon Republican economist Art Laffer, despite his discredited ideas and record.\n\nYesterday, the White House announced the newest recipient of the Medal of Freedom: Ed Meese. From the official statement:\n\nEdwin Meese III has long been a thought leader and strong conservative voice on matters of law and policy. As Counselor to President Ronald Reagan, Mr. Meese helped to craft a foreign policy strong enough to end the Cold War and played a pivotal role in securing historic tax cuts. As Attorney General, he promoted Federalism and the original public understanding of our Constitution. Since leaving public service, Edwin Meese has continued to champion our Nation\u2019s founding principles through his extensive work at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nReading this, one might get the impression that the president is giving the medal to Meese because he\u2019s a notable conservative \u2013 which isn\u2019t generally the sort of thing that warrants the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor.\n\nBut for those familiar with Meese\u2019s background, there\u2019s a bit more to his c.v. that\u2019s worth appreciating.\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation process, Meese was investigated by a court appointed independent counsel, which examined a variety of corruption allegations. The investigation culminated in a report that did not include criminal charges, but which nevertheless rebuked Meese for ethical lapses.\n\nHe was confirmed anyway.\n\nDuring his tenure as Reagan\u2019s attorney general, Meese was caught up in the Iran-Contra scandal, during which he told Reagan that presidential powers are inherently broad enough to circumvent legal limits: so long as the president was acting with national security interests in mind, Meese argued, laws passed by Congress could be overlooked.\n\nIn fact, as far as Meese was concerned, the White House didn\u2019t even have to tell Congress when the president was ignoring federal laws. (What\u2019s more, this was not only the scandal of his tenure as A.G.)\n\nFor Trump to give this guy the Presidential Medal of Freedom is a little on the nose, isn\u2019t it?", "description": "For Trump to give Ed Meese the Presidential Medal of Freedom is a little on the nose, isn't it?", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/450850877.jpg?itok=T0xhSy07", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
