Congress may make a fresh effort to define the term", "language": "en", "text": "This fall could deliver another round in a Washington food fight, as three congressmen last month re-introduced a bill that aims to define the term \u201cnatural cheese.\u201d\n\nThe supporters of the CURD Act include Kraft Heinz Co. KHC, +0.99% and the International Dairy Foods Association. Representatives for both Kraft and the trade group described the bill as an effort to preserve cheese makers\u2019 ability to differentiate \u201cnatural cheese\u201d from \u201cprocess cheese\u201d in supermarkets so that consumers know what they\u2019re buying.\n\nBut Consumer Reports doesn\u2019t see it that way, and it\u2019s among the groups against the measure, whose full name is the Codifying Useful Regulatory Definitions Act. The nonprofit organization has argued the bill would \u201cadd to consumer confusion at the supermarket and undermine ongoing efforts to make food labeling clearer and more consistent.\u201d Consumer Reports says the CURD Act would allow cheese to be labeled \u201cnatural\u201d even if it contains a food dye or if it was produced using added hormones or other substances that weren\u2019t widely viewed as natural in a recent survey. And the bill would undermine the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s ongoing process to define the term \u201cnatural,\u201d according to the nonprofit. The FDA collected public comments on the term in 2015, but it hasn\u2019t taken action so far.\n\nThe International Dairy Foods Association has pushed back on that concern related to the FDA\u2019s process. \u201cBecause the term \u2018natural cheese\u2019 is used to define a general category or type of cheese product, it does not fall within the scope of this process and must be addressed separately. This proposed legislation does that,\u201d said Dave Carlin, the trade group\u2019s senior vice president for legislative affairs and economic policy, in a statement.\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsors in the House are two Democrats \u2014 Rep. Ron Kind of Wisconsin and Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon \u2014 and one Republican, Rep. Billy Long of Missouri. They re-introduced the CURD Act in late September after the measure failed to win passage in the House last December. The bill did pass the Senate last year, and it was re-introduced in that chamber this year, with backing from Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and other lawmakers.\n\nRelated: \u2018Natural\u2019 and \u2018farm fresh\u2019 are not always what they seem \u2013\u2013 read this before shopping\n\nAnd see: People are splurging on gluten-free superfoods\u2014for their dogs and cats\n\nThe CURD Act also has faced opposition from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a watchdog group, as well as the Good Food Institute, which advocates for plant-based alternatives to dairy products and meat. The center noted last year that the bill could \u201cprevent the term \u2018natural\u2019 from being used on non-dairy cheese alternatives that may otherwise rightly be considered natural by consumers.\u201d A spokesman for the center said this week that it remains opposed to the measure.\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone helped prevent the CURD Act from passing the House in December, as he spoke against the measure and voiced the same concerns aired by consumer advocates and supporters of plant-based alternatives. A spokeswoman for Pallone, who is the House Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s chairman, didn\u2019t respond to a question this week about whether his stance on the bill has changed.\n\nPittsburgh-based Kraft Heinz, the Washington-based International Dairy Foods Association and privately held, Wisconsin-based cheese maker Sargento Foods Inc. have disclosed that they\u2019ve engaged in lobbying on the CURD Act this year. Kraft\u2019s overall disclosed spending on Washington lobbying was $920,000 last year, followed by an outlay of $570,000 in this year\u2019s first half, while the corresponding figures for the trade group are $1.32 million and $620,000, according to OpenSecrets.org data.\n\nSargento\u2019s disclosed spending on influencing Washington was $100,000 last year, and it already has matched that in this year\u2019s first half, with an outlay of $100,000. The company didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nRelated: Impossible Burger couldn\u2019t be sold in supermarkets until the company secured FDA approval of a game-changing ingredient\n\nAnd see: Beech-Nut baby food and Twinings Tea contain traces of a chemical linked to cancer \u2014 should you be concerned?\n\nThe overall disclosed spending on lobbying by Consumer Reports was $210,000 last year, followed by an outlay of $70,000 in this year\u2019s first half, while the Center for Science in Public Interest and Good Food Institute have disclosed spending $50,000 and $30,000, respectively, over the past year and a half.", "description": "This fall could deliver another round in a Washington food fight, as three congressmen last month re-introduced a bill that aims to define the term \u201cnatural...", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Money", "Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT003_cheese_ZG_20191009161741.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
