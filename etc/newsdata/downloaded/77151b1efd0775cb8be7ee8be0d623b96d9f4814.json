Jewellery, gorgeous clothes, you name it, he\u2019s the most kind, generous person.\n\n\u201cWhen close friends and family heard Derek was paying for me to have gastric surgery they thought it was insulting, but nothing could\u2019ve been further from the truth. It was the most loving, thoughtful present in the world.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d dreamed about going on that Caribbean cruise for years but we agreed weight loss surgery would be a gift for life, while a cruise would just last a few days.\u201d\n\nThe mum of three is now a svelte 8st 5lb after weighing 15st 7lb at her heaviest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019ve gone in a time machine back to when we were first married,\u201d she added.We seriously fancy each other again, which is something you don\u2019t often hear from a couple in their 50s who\u2019ve been married a quarter of a century.\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\n\u201cOur sex life is great, my depression has completely lifted, and our kids constantly tell us how happy we seem.\u201d\n\nLouise, who is a full-time carer to their 28-year-old daughter Laura who has Down\u2019s syndrome, started piling on pounds when her mother died of cancer in 2010.\n\nLouise could not stick to any diet she tried.\n\n\u201cMum and I were best friends, and when she died I sunk into a massive depression. I found \u00adsolace in food, secretly bingeing on massive bars of chocolate when everyone was asleep.\n\n\u201cMy depression left me unable to deal with the fact that I was killing myself.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\nLouise also cooked high-calorie meals for the family in Hempstead, Kent, such as fillet steak with mashed potato, huge casseroles, mushrooms in garlic butter, and creamy puddings.\n\nSoon Derek\u2019s shirt size grew from a size XL to XXXL and the previously active couple spent \u00adevenings grazing on junk food on the sofa.\n\nIn 2017 Louise tried for months to slim for her stepdaughter\u2019s wedding \u2013 but got nowhere.\n\n\u201cThe idea of looking like a blob in those wedding photos horrified me but month by month I tried and failed with yet another diet,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOn their big day in July last year I was the same size 20, weighing 15st 7lb and I hated myself more than ever.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t get healthy soon Laura would lose her mum and without me I didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do.\n\n\u201cIt was a vicious cycle of guilt, despair and depression.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\nInspired by a friend\u2019s sister who\u2019d had success with weight loss surgery, Louise looked \u00adonline \u2013 and baulked at the cost.\n\n\u201cI knew we had our dream cruise coming up in a few months, so money was tight, but when I opened up to Derek about how down I was, he didn\u2019t hesitate for one second.\n\nHe told Louise: \u201cIf money can\u2019t buy you happiness, what\u2019s the point?\u201d and within minutes was cancelling the cruise.\n\nShe said: \u201cOf course I knew the results of any surgery are never guaranteed, but I also knew I\u2019d die soon if I didn\u2019t try this. I gave Derek the biggest hug ever.\u201d\n\nLouise went to private Benenden Hospital near Cranbrook, Kent, where bariatric surgeon Ahmed Hamouda recommended a gastric sleeve. It means removing a part of the stomach to reduce its size.\n\nShe had the surgery on August 1 last year and by the end of October was down to a size 12, the same as when she and Derek wed in 1994.\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\n\u201cI simply didn\u2019t feel hungry and within weeks knew I wasn\u2019t going to die any more. That sense of euphoria was incredible, like I\u2019d been let out of prison.\u201d\n\nWithin weeks Louise was exercising for the first time in over a decade \u2013 going to \u00adkickboxing and circuit classes and riding her bicycle.\n\nBut while she was \u201cbouncing around like Tigger\u201d, 19-stone Derek was stuck in the same rut.\n\n\u201cI was slightly oblivious to the fact that the slimmer I got, the worse Derek felt about his weight,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was so overjoyed with my new life that I just wanted to return the incredible gesture as a Christmas present. I had some savings and was even prepared to put it on credit if I had to.\u201d\n\nThat Christmas \u2013 without knowing Louise had put a voucher in a card for a consultation with Mr Hamouda \u2013 Derek refused to sit next to Louise for photographs.\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\n\u201cHe just felt so big next to me, it was truly painful for him. But I knew that that evening he\u2019d be over the moon with what 2019 had in store for him.\u201d\n\nWhen Derek saw the voucher, he told her it was too expensive.\n\n\u201cI told Derek that I loved him more than any amount of money, any cruise, and I wouldn\u2019t hear him say no,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the new year Mr Hamouda advised Derek to have a gastric balloon. This is a non-surgical option where a soft silicon balloon is inflated in the stomach to make you feel full quicker.\n\nA month later Derek, a self-employed engineer, had it fitted in a simple 30-minute procedure and his weight fell quickly.\n\n\u201cBy then I was cooking much healthier options at home for myself, which I was happy to double-up for Derek,\u201d Louise said. \u201cWithin a few weeks I could see him happier, like he knew this was the start of something incredibly exciting.\u201d\n\nThe couple splashed out on new bicycles, enjoying long \u00adcountry rides in the evening and at weekends.\n\nBy August he had lost six stone, dropping from a 47 to a 34-inch waist. He is now down to 12 stone after shedding seven stone altogether.\n\nDerek, 57, who has four kids from his first marriage, said: \u201cLike most blokes I like spoiling my wife but I hate the idea of someone wasting money on me. But Louise wasn\u2019t going to budge with her Christmas present.\u201d\n\nWith a work medical coming up in the spring, he also feared he might be deemed a liability and lose his income.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a history of heart attacks and stroke in my family, so it made sense to follow Louise\u2019s lead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked out we\u2019ll save the \u00a312,000 we spent on our procedures in two years, and how we feel now about each other and life is better than any cruise.\u201d", "description": "Louise and Derek Mills cancelled an \u00a38,000 Caribbean cruise to spend the money on gastric surgery for Louise - then six months later they splashed out \u00a34,000 on a gastric balloon procedure for Derek", "authors": ["Matthew Barbour", "Image", "Tim Merry"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466503.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Louise-and-Derek-Mills.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
