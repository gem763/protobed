Here\u2019s our pick of the best places to unwind.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The award-winning spa offers a contemporary, holistic approach to wellness, with treatments such as oxygen detox facials and reiki carried out by magic-fingered therapists using Oskia and Natura Biss\u00e9 products.\n\nThe hotel is also home to Europe\u2019s largest hydrotherapy pool, pine-scented aromatherapy saunas and crystal steam rooms in the swanky changing rooms. But if the thought of kicking back quite that much makes you angsty, there are more high-energy pursuits on offer, including tennis, golf, archery and, for the budding agriculturalist, duck herding.\n\nFrom \u00a3325 per night\n\nchewtonglen.com\n\nLime Wood\n\nNeighbourhood: Lyndhurst\n\nEver the haunt of wearied Londoners looking for a place to unwind and \u201cde-city\u201d, Lime Wood \u2013 which dates back to the 13th century when it started life as a hunting lodge \u2013 is a little haven of tranquillity set amongst manicured lawns and towering forests. The refined, glass-encased Herb House spa is a delightful place to succumb to knot-busting Bamford de-stress massages and bespoke Sarah Chapman skincare treatments, and the luxury continues with wood-burning stoves and deep roll-top bathtubs in the rooms and lakeside cabins. You\u2019ll also find a swoosh-worthy hydrotherapy and steam pool circuit on site and for food, Raw & Cured serves up salads, cured fish and meat from Lime Wood\u2019s own Smoke House.\n\nFrom \u00a3395 per night\n\nlimewoodhotel.co.uk\n\nNeighbourhood: Brockenhurst\n\nThis 17th-century country house hotel was once King Charles II\u2019s favourite hunting lodge and the place where his mistress Nell Gwynn, a famous comic actor of the Restoration period, resided. Now, there\u2019s significantly less animal slaughter and adultery, and a lot more family-friendly spa fun. The on-site cr\u00e8che keeps kids entertained while parents chill out in the swimming pool, thermal rooms, foot spa, experience shower and outdoor hot tub. There are also thermal pools with panoramic countryside views and treatment rooms where frangipani salt scrubs and blemish control facials are carried out by flickering candlelight.\n\nFrom \u00a3159 per night\n\nnewparkmanorhotel.co.uk\n\nNeighbourhood: Brockenhurst\n\nFor a truly good-looking take on wellness, Rhinefield does mock Tudor on an epic scale \u2013 think towering turrets, pristine topiary, carved fireplaces dusted with history and the Armada dining room, the walls of which are covered with impressive carvings of naval fleets. Oh, and it\u2019s all within leaping distance of the forest. There\u2019s plenty to do here beyond the exquisite Elemis hot stone massages and age-defying facials in the two treatment rooms, including croquet and giant dominos on the gleaming lawns, a dizzying Hornbeam maze, heated indoor and outdoor pools, tennis, and rental bikes so you can pack a picnic and explore the winding paths of the New Forest at your own pace.\n\nFrom \u00a3143 per night\n\nhandpickedhotels.co.uk\n\nNeighbourhood: Lyndhurst\n\nThe historic corridors of this fascinating family-owned hotel have played host to kings, queens and generals for hundreds of years. Not only is the land that it stands on mentioned in the Doomsday Book, it\u2019s gone through multiple incarnations since as a hunting lodge, a Great War army hospital and the place where General Eisenhower issued orders for the D-Day Landings. There\u2019s even history hanging on the walls, with framed Second World War documents and beautiful antique furnishings lending an air of import to the terracotta-brick property. The Soltus spa is soothing without being showy, with reclaimed wood furnishings, ESPA facials and aromatherapy massages in six treatment rooms, as well as a cocoon-like couples\u2019 treatment area for detox wraps and salt and oil scrubs.\n\nFrom \u00a3129 per night\n\nbalmerlawnhotel.com\n\nNeighbourhood: Brockenhurst\n\nThis pretty manor house hotel has an award-winning jewel in its crown: an indulgent Thai spa that defies you to be stressed on departure. SenSpa offers up all the traditional massage options, as well as more alternative wellbeing therapies, from Rhassoul mud treatments to AlphaSphere Deluxe, where you recline in your own private pod to be soothed by sound therapy, colour therapy, aromatherapy and vibration. At the heart of the spa is a large, still, ozone pool enclaved by a whirlpool tub, sauna and steam room. Next door, there\u2019s a tranquil hydrotherapy area with a herbal sauna, crystal steam room, laconium, tepidarium, health showers, and ice room. Upstairs, rooms range from bijou and comfortable, to four-poster and grand, and there are three restaurants to choose from, including Spring Green London, which serves up botanical superfoods for hardcore wellness-seekers.\n\nFrom \u00a3175 per night\n\ncareysmanor.com\n\nNeighbourhood: Lymington\n\nThis is a real make yourself at home hotel \u2013 slightly shabby in parts but as welcoming as a pair of worn-in slippers. The former home of Lord and Lady Arthur Cecil, Queen Victoria\u2019s private secretary and his wife, this 16th-century coaching inn is steeped in history, replete with claw-foot armchairs, panelled ceilings, gilt mirrors and grand fireplaces with stories to tell.\n\nHole up in the bijou massage room for bamboo stick massages and Ayurvedic face-lift facials, or take a stroll around the bloom-filled Monet garden, complete with lake, fountain, sundials, a model Concorde suspended from the trees and a cemetery of the former owner\u2019s pets, including Ben the donkey who departed this mortal realm in 1905. There are also more traditional tennis courts, fitness classes, a putting green and a gleamingly manicured croquet lawn.\n\nFrom \u00a390 per night\n\npassfordhousehotel.co.uk\n\nThe Pig\n\nNeighbourhood: Brockenhurst\n\nIt\u2019s a sneaky entry, this, because there is no designated spa at The Pig. But there are brilliantly quaint Potting Shed and Shepherd\u2019s Hut treatment rooms at the bottom of the walled garden, where best-of-the-best therapists from (the often fully-booked) Lime Wood down the road come to administer bespoke massages surrounded by glowing lanterns and the gentle hum of the on-site beehives outside.\n\nGuests at this glorious country house hotel \u2013 as loved for its well-stocked Kitchen Garden as it is for its forest hideaways and snug rooms \u2013 are also welcome to use the Herb House Spa (a 10-minute drive away) for a small fee, before returning for gin cocktails and \u201cpiggy bits\u201d (i.e. posh crackling, sausage rolls and scotch eggs) as the sun goes down.\n\nFrom \u00a3160 per night\n\nthepighotel.com", "description": "The best spa hotels in the New Forest, as chosen by our resident expert.", "authors": ["Lizzie Pook"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/22/16/new-forest-pony.jpg"}
