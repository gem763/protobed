Pictured: Avarua airport in the Cook Islands\n\nSome said that Jetstar staff locked themselves in a staff room to avoid answering questions.\n\nOne woman, Kimberly King, even confronted Cook Islands Prime Minister Henry Puna over the shambles.\n\nShe ran into him later in a hotel across the road from the airport while he was meeting an Australian businessman, reported the New Zealand Herald.\n\nMs King said she told him: 'I wanted to let you know it was really bad at the airport. We've got elderly lying on the floor, everyone is exhausted and we have no food and water'.\n\nOne woman even confronted Cook Islands Prime Minister Henry Puna (pictured)\n\nBut she said he took little interest and his staff told her to 'write a letter to Jetstar'.\n\nEventually the passengers were told that their flight had been cancelled due to crew sickness and they were put on other flights.\n\nOne passenger Brenton Barker said it was the worst customer service he had ever experienced.\n\n'I think the worst part about it is the lack of communication,' he told the New Zealand Herald.\n\n'In 40 years of flying across the globe, never have I nor my family been treated so poorly.'\n\nA Jetstar spokesman said: 'Our goal is always to get our customers to their destination safely and on time and we sincerely apologise for the recent cancellation and any issues around accommodation availability at short notice during the busy holiday period.\n\n'Unfortunately the crew member became unwell after arrival in Rarotonga which meant we had to cancel the return service from Rarotonga to Auckland.'\n\nA spokesman for the Cook Islands PM said: 'On behalf of the people of the Cook Islands, the Office of the Prime Minister would like to express sympathy to any passenger affected by recent airline cancellations.\n\n'It is the sincere wish of every Cook Islander that the visitors to our islands have a satisfying experience.'", "description": "Flight JQ130 from the Cook Islands to Auckland was cancelled minutes before departure at 1.30am on Saturday.
