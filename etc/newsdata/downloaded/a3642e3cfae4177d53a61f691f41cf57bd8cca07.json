REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo\n\nIn a letter late on Monday, prosecutors said they and Nike had already turned over 3,360 pages of documents to Avenatti, and the added materials he wanted were irrelevant to his knowledge or state of mind when he allegedly broke the law.\n\nProsecutors accused Avenatti of threatening to publicize claims that Nike arranged for payments to elite college basketball recruits, unless the athletic wear company paid him more than $20 million and hired him to manage an internal probe.\n\nAvenatti appeared to be on \u201ca mission to uncover evidence that he speculates might show payments (that he asserts, without explanation, might be unlawful) to unidentified \u2018other\u2019 players,\u201d prosecutors told U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe.\n\nThey called the proposed subpoena \u201ca fishing expedition for material without relevance to the forthcoming trial.\u201d\n\nAvenatti, 48, became famous for representing porn star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, in lawsuits involving U.S. President Donald Trump and his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\n\u201cI look forward to a jury hearing the real truth as to what happened as opposed to the fairytale scripted by Trump\u2019s DOJ,\u201d Avenatti said in an email on Tuesday, referring to the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nAvenatti\u2019s lawyers have said their client was entitled to present \u201cevidence of broader misconduct directed by Nike across amateur basketball\u201d in his defence, which a subpoena could help unearth.\n\nNike has denied Avenatti\u2019s claims, and in a letter made public on Friday, opposed a subpoena. \u201cIt is Mr. Avenatti\u2014not Nike\u2014on trial,\u201d the company\u2019s lawyers wrote.\n\nAvenatti also faces federal charges in Manhattan of stealing about $300,000 from Daniels after helping her secure a book contract.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Southern California have separately charged Avenatti with wire fraud, bank fraud and other crimes, saying he stole millions of dollars from clients.\n\nAvenatti has pleaded not guilty to the various charges.\n\nThe case is U.S. v. Avenatti, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-cr-00373.", "description": "U.S. prosecutors urged a Manhattan federal judge to reject Michael Avenatti's request to subpoena Nike Inc, calling it a \"fishing expedition\" unrelated to a criminal case accusing the embattled lawyer of extortion.", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433384981&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1DC", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
