The quasi-federal institution changed its events policy this year to allow its 19 museums \u2014 and the zoo \u2014 to host personal and nonprofit events in addition to corporate parties. The timing worked out well for Mazzola and Akman, who had been together for 10 years before deciding in March that they wanted to get married this fall. Many of the city\u2019s distinct spaces were already booked, but a Smithsonian venue seemed just right for the couple, who collect art and are active in the city\u2019s performing arts scene.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMazzola used to work at the D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities, and he continues to direct productions at In Series, a local organization dedicated to opera and musical theater. Akman, a psychiatrist, is vice president for health affairs and dean of the School of Medicine and Health Sciences at George Washington University.\n\nCollaborating with Mark Chaikowski, a longtime friend and event planner who has produced events at Smithsonian facilities, Akman and Mazzola found their perfect venue in the Renwick\u2019s second-floor Grand Salon.\n\n\u201cTo bring our friends into a space with art felt right to us,\u201d Akman said. \u201cThe Renwick was perfect for several reasons. We liked the scale, and the temple was still installed. The art in the upstairs galleries is whimsical, colorful. It\u2019s not the old masters at the National Gallery.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Smithsonian\u2019s new events policy \u2014 a three-year pilot that launched March 1 \u2014 will bring in much-needed revenue for the world\u2019s largest cultural organization. The Smithsonian must raise about $500 million in earned revenue and donations each year to supplement its $1 billion annual federal subsidy. Opening about a dozen of its signature spaces \u2014 including the historic Arts and Industries Building, the Natural History Museum\u2019s rotunda and the elegant Kogod Courtyard (shared by the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery) \u2014 for private celebrations such as birthdays, weddings and retirement dinners will help meet its fundraising goals.\n\n\u201cThere has been talk (about allowing private events) for the last 20 years\u201d Chaikowski said. \u201cThis is a wonderful opportunity for everybody. It\u2019s a good fit for the museums, and for nonprofits, it\u2019s great because people will come to the events because of the wonderful locations.\u201d\n\nThe Smithsonian spaces will probably have a limited audience for private events, officials said. The Cooper Hewitt Design Museum in New York hosted two weddings in its garden in August, and a wedding has been booked for the Kogod Courtyard next summer. There have been inquiries about using the Renwick and the National Museum of American History, where event staff hosted event and wedding planners last month. They come with many challenges.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe facilities are only available after the museums close, shortening the normal running time for some events and making preparations difficult. Chaikowski\u2019s crews spent several hours the night before Mazzola and Akman\u2019s reception setting up sound and lighting, and they returned on Saturday at 6 a.m. to do more before the museum opened. Saturday\u2019s event started at 7 p.m. (the museum had closed to the public at 5:30), with a 30-minute ceremony featuring poetry recited by D.C. theater luminary Michael Kahn, a reading from Justice Anthony M. Kennedy\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage and songs performed by artists who have worked with Mazzola. A cocktail hour followed, then dinner and dancing until 11:30 p.m.\n\nEverything for the ceremony and celebration had to be brought in \u2014 table and chairs, lighting and sound equipment, a temporary kitchen, bars, and a stage for the 15-piece band \u2014 and then removed before the museum opened on Sunday morning.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Burning Man,\u201d Mazzola said, drawing a comparison to the annual desert festival that served as the inspiration for Best\u2019s temple. \u201cIt all comes in and it all goes out.\u201d\n\nThe Smithsonian also has rules about what drinks are allowed in the gallery (the cosmos were made with white cranberry juice, for example), and red wine could be poured only at the tables.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA private event is also pricey. The Smithsonian charged $25,000 for the event space, according to museum officials. The couple declined to detail other expenses, but Chaikowski said there were more workers \u2014 from bartenders to band members to the lighting and sound crews \u2014 than there were guests.\n\nDuring the cocktail hour, guests enjoyed bite-size crab cakes, coconut shrimp and lamb chop \u201cpops\u201d as they roamed the galleries that display signature pieces of the Renwick\u2019s collection, including Wendell Castle\u2019s \u201cGhost Clock,\u201d Karen LaMonte\u2019s \u201cReclining Dress Impression with Drapery\u201d and Albert Paley\u2019s \u201cPortal Gates.\u201d Some took photos in front of Larry Fuente\u2019s \u201cGame Fish,\u201d a brightly adorned wall piece that is another Renwick favorite.\n\nDinner, served in the temple, was corn chowder, green-curry king salmon over kaffir lime rice, and a trio of sorbets. Akman and Mazzola shared their first dance as \u201cTina Turner\u201d performed \u201cLet\u2019s Stay Together,\u201d a surprise that brought everyone to their feet, with dozens of phones recording the performance.\n\nThe evening ended with guests lining the grand staircase as Akman and Mazzola exited to a waiting car, with Tina behind the wheel.\n\nAD", "description": "The museum\u2019s new events policy led to a local couple\u2019s \u201cperfect\u201d night playing out artfully at the Renwick Gallery.", "authors": ["Peggy Mcglone", "Reporter Covering The Arts In The Washington Region"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jvtRoEw3_tdxokbXoQ9OQclTS-U=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OSVJKZHPOAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
