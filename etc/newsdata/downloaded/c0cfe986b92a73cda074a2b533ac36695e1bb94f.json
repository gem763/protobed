He\u2019d be on stage talking (expletive), the shooter would be coming at him, and he\u2019d be like, \u2018Sit down.\u2019 He\u2019d definitely make a funny noise when he got hit. \u2026 It would be funny.\u201d\n\nMr. Gillis came under fire last week over his past use of racist and homophobic slurs after it was announced that he would be joining \u201cSNL\u2019s\u201d new season. The stand-up comedian gave a half-hearted apology to \u201canyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said,\u201d but defended himself as a \u201ccomedian who pushes boundaries.\u201d NBC later announced that Mr. Gillis would not be joining the show.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been weird,\u201d the comedian said Wednesday, USA Today reported. \u201cTwitter, obviously, has been nuts. You try to stay off it when the whole country hates you. That\u2019s not a fun feeling.\u201d\n\nMr. Gillias said he\u2019s been doing \u201cOK\u201d since his firing and spoke about the support he\u2019s received from former \u201cSNL\u201d stars Rob Schneider and Norm Macdonald.\n\n\u201cAs soon as they decide you\u2019re a bad guy, you\u2019re just alt-right now or something,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor real, though, I did not vote for Donald Trump,\u201d he said, reportedly winking at the audience. \u201cLook at me: I didn\u2019t, but that was tough. His whole campaign was at me. \u2018Are you a fat idiot?\u2019 \u2018Yeah, dude, what\u2019re we doing?\u2019\n\n\u201cTrump is funny,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s funnier than everyone I know. If Trump was the next comic, he\u2019d bury me. He\u2019d come out and be like, \u2018Fat. Loser. Fired.\u2019\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
