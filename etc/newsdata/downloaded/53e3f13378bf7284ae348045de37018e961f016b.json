You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cYou have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies ... if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d he is heard saying.\n\n\u201cAnd does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. ... But look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d\n\nShortly after The Verge posted their story of the leaked audio, Ms Warren responded, saying that it would \"really 'suck' ... if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompettive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\"\n\n\n\nSince that July town hall with Facebook employees, the prospects of a Warren presidency appear to have only grown brighter. The Massachusetts senator has shot to within striking distance of the up-until-now formidable Joe Biden in many polls, and in several she is beating the former vice president.\n\nAnd, in the process, some big-money Democrats have begun to express concerns with what an Elizabeth Warren presidency would mean for the wealthy elite in industries that have long bankrolled Democratic presidential candidates \u2014 including, notably, Wall Street.\n\nSome Democratic Wall Street donors have even indicated they would vote for Donald Trump instead of Ms Warren.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in a box because you\u2019re a Democrat and you\u2019re thinking, \u2018I want to help the party, but she\u2019s going to hurt me, so I\u2019m going to help President Trump,\u2019\u201d one senior private equity executive told CNBC.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren\u00a0can add\u00a0Facebook\u00a0to the list of folks\u00a0who appear to be scared about her potential presidency, according to leaked audio of company CEO\u00a0Mark Zuckerburg.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/01/17/warren-zuckerberg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
