While Lam said she wanted to give the speech in front of the legislature, it\u2019s unclear if protesters will seek to block her from doing so.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you agree that the most important livelihood issue that a chief executive should address would be housing and land supply,\u201d Lam said on Tuesday. She first unveiled her controversial plan to reclaim land off Lantau Island during last year\u2019s address.\n\nHere are some measures local media are reporting may be included in the upcoming address:\n\nThe Hong Kong Economic Journal reported Wednesday that Lam plans to announce a target for compulsory land requisitions of 700 hectares over the next five years.\n\nThe government will ease immigration rules for tech talent, expanding its current plan to woo workers to cover those employed by companies outside of the Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport, Sing Tao Daily reported.\n\nHong Kong plans to expand its railway network by constructing three new railway extensions, Cable TV news reported late Tuesday\n\nLam\u2019s administration has struggled for months to resolve escalating protests sparked by a since-withdrawn bill allowing extraditions to China that have expanded into a broader push for greater democracy. The violence intensified in October after Lam invoked a rarely used emergency law to ban protesters from wearing masks.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s economy contracted in the second quarter and is widely expected to have fallen into a technical recession as soon as the third. The U.S.-China trade war has impacted exports while protests have scared away visitors from the city\u2019s shopping malls, restaurants and luxury hotels.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund this week slashed its forecasts for Hong Kong\u2019s economic growth, now estimating expansion of just 0.3% in 2019, down from the 2.7% forecast in April.\n\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan presented a $2.4 billion stimulus package in August to help bolster the economy. He\u2019s also called on property owners and developers to offer rent relief to struggling retailers. About 100 restaurants have shut down because of the unrest, affecting about 2,000 employees, he said in a Chinese-language blog post on Sunday.\n\n(Updates with details of potential measures in fourth paragraph)", "description": "Carrie Lam to Present Policy Speech as Hong Kong Braces for Recession", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic42f89f289851c5ed53c5e8de2cb798bf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
