A congressional dance video Read more\n\nThe newspaper said that Last Tangle Salon charges $80 for a haircut and $180 for lowlights \u201caccording to sources familiar with the salon\u201d. The paper also factored in a 20% tip of $52, bringing the total of the entire hair maintenance experience to $312.\n\nThe paper quoted Richard Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, who described Ocasio-Cortez as \u201cthe Eva Peron of American politics. She preaches socialism while living the life of the privileged.\u201d\n\nBut women on Twitter defended the Congresswoman, saying the ones who should be checking their privilege in the haircare wars were men, who clearly had no idea how much women were routinely charged for haircuts and colour treatments.\n\n\u201cSorry, you don\u2019t get to create beauty standards that require women to spend hundreds or thousands a year to be considered presentable and then hate us for it,\u201d tweeted the writer Jessica Valenti.\n\nJessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) 1) this would obvs never be a story about a man\n\n\n\n2) this is not an expensive haircut/color for a public figure who is frequently on TV\n\n\n\n3) if her hair was raggedy, that would be the lead story instead\n\n\n\n4) \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44https://t.co/CyXaQ860ts\n\n(((Helaine Olen))) (@helaineolen) Leaving all other issues aside, $80 for a woman's haircut is a bargain in NYC. What are people expecting #AOC to do? Go to a salon's free hair model night? https://t.co/sFZEY3rBTR\n\nBrandon Darby (@brandondarby) I keep seeing ladies on Twitter saying AOC\u2019s $80 haircut was a good deal. No, this is what a good deal looks like: pic.twitter.com/pGscb3D5Zq\n\nOthers drew attention to the article\u2019s assertion that Ocasio-Cortez \u201ccould have saved roughly $100 for the same hairstyle at the government-subsidized Capitol Hill barbershop\u201d.\n\n\u201cHer high-dollar hairdo stands in stark contrast to that of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator from Alabama who is a regular customer at Senate Hair Care Services,\u201d the article said.\n\n\u201cAt that place, open to members of Congress and the public, a men\u2019s cut runs about $20, though men\u2019s haircuts there and everywhere else are cheaper than women\u2019s,\u201d the article acknowledges.\n\nMany questioned the choice of Jeff Sessions as a model. \u201cDamn, why didn\u2019t AOC ask for a rec[ommendation] from hair icon *checks notes* Jeff Sessions?\u201d wrote one person.\n\nJosh Billinson (@jbillinson) \u201cWhy won\u2019t AOC get her hair cut like Jeff Sessions?\u201d is certainly a take pic.twitter.com/sybZxjm26P\n\nDefence reporter Katie Bo Williams pointed out the irony that the paper was incensed that Ocasio-Cortez, whom the article calls a \u201cself-declared socialist\u201d had paid a business for a haircut, rather than get a government-subsidised one at the salon recommended by the article.\n\nKatie Bo Williams (@KatieBoWill) Look I wasn\u2019t going to get involved in this @AOC hair scandal. I really wasn\u2019t. Bc I\u2019m a defense reporter and, why? But I cannot NOT remark that the story seems distressed that AOC, a \u201csocialist,\u201d got a $300 haircut instead of...a government-subsidized one?https://t.co/D7q9c4tL0p pic.twitter.com/OJ46UrkBOF", "description": "Congresswoman targeted with report she spent nearly $300 at salon, a sum many pointed out as a pretty good deal", "authors": ["Kate Lyons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56bb2b973f515de9b7b650023c7c261d53b4db28/247_85_3253_1952/master/3253.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c3866e6356d3ef413c02dbf8452d6e88", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
