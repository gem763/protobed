The two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition.\n\nSydney-based Code Barrel was founded by two of the first engineers who built Jira at Atlassian, Nick Menere and Andreas Knecht. With this acquisition, they are returning to Atlassian after four years in startup land.\n\n\u201cFor me and Andreas, it\u2019s almost like coming home,\u201d said Menere, who joined the Jira team in 2005 when there were only a handful of developers working on the product. \u201cIt\u2019s the place where we pretty much learned how to develop software and how to develop product. For us, this was the only company we would ever go back to.\u201d\n\nAs the name implies, Automation for Jira makes it easy to automate recurring tasks in Atlassian\u2019s issue and project tracking service. \u201cIncreasingly, [our customers] are having to spend a lot of time on the mundane,\u201d Noah Wasmer, the VP of Product for Tech Teams at Atlassian, told me. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that with Jira as the backbone, they are interacting with a lot of systems, are duplicating work, are manually entering work into different systems. And so what we\u2019re finding is that they\u2019re spending an inordinate amount of time doing things that aren\u2019t actually helping them build and create those next-generation things that help change our world.\u201d\n\nIf you want to reduce this kind of duplication of work, then automation is the obvious thing to look at. And with more than 6,000 companies that found Code Barrel\u2019s solution in Atlassian\u2019s marketplace, plus the founders\u2019 obvious connection to the company, Automation for Jira must have been an obvious candidate for an acquisition.\n\nWasmer also stressed that the fact that they built a no-code tool will allow anybody who uses Jira to create scripts without having to be a programmer. Automation for Jira allows users to set up time-based rules or those that run based on triggers inside of Jira. It also features third-party integrations with SMS, Slack and Microsoft Teams, among others.\n\nFor the time being, Automation for Jira will remain in the Atlassian Marketplace and will continue to sell at the same price of $5/user/month for teams with up to 10 users and $2.5/user/month for teams between 11 and 100 users, with prices going down from there for larger enterprises. Surely, Atlassian will start integrating some of the tool\u2019s features into Jira, but for the time being the company doesn\u2019t have anything to announce on that front.", "description": "Atlassian today announced that it has acquired Code Barrel, the makers of Automation for Jira, a low-code tool for easily automating many aspects of Jira that\u2019s also one of the most popular add-ons for Jira Software and Jira Service Desk in Atlassian\u2019s marketplace.
