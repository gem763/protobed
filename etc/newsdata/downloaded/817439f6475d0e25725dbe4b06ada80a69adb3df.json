It\u2019s earth-shaking potentially in its implications for American politics in the next decade \u2014 if, of course, Sinema has the nerve to stick to her guns.\n\nTake the liberal drive to bust down age-old Senate rules in order to pass \u201cMedicare for All\u201d or a \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d Sinema not only opposes getting rid of the 60-vote filibuster threshold for legislation, she wants to restore the supermajority requirement for presidential nominees that has been weakened by both parties. \u201cThey will not get my vote on [nuking the filibuster],\u201d Sinema said in her office, outfitted with shiny leather and translucent chairs and boasting a vivid shade of purple that pops from the walls. \u201cIn fact, whether I\u2019m in the majority or the minority I would always vote to reinstate the protections for the minority. \u2026 It is the right thing for the country.\u201d\u2026 \u201cEveryone knows that I am very independent-minded,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that it\u2019s not super useful to try and convince me otherwise.\u201d\n\nPhilip Klein grasped the significance of that immediately. There are two key questions being asked of the progressive lions, Bernie and Warren, in the Democratic primary this year. One: How will you pay for your agenda? They\u2019ll, uh, get back to you on that. Two: How will you pass your agenda? After all, so long as the filibuster remains in place, a new Democratic president would need 60 votes in the Senate to get Medicare for All or free college tuition through Congress. And no matter how badly Republicans do next fall, they\u2019ll have far more than the 41 votes they need to block any legislation in the event that Schumer ends up in charge of the Senate.\n\nBernie has been fidgety about ending the filibuster, grumbling back in February that he was reluctant to see it happen, but the simple reality is that he can\u2019t implement socialist programs without getting rid of it. He\u2019s begun to come around. Warren, on the other hand, has accepted it as a cost of doing progressive business from the beginning. She called for nuking it months ago. If she gets elected in 2020, it\u2019ll be job one for the Senate.\n\nThe nice thing for Warren and Schumer is that it doesn\u2019t take 60 votes to change the rules and end the filibuster. It only takes 51. That\u2019s how Harry Reid was able to nuke the filibuster for non-SCOTUS executive nominees in 2013 and how McConnell was able to nuke it for Supreme Court nominees four years later. All you need is a simple majority to get rid of it. And it\u2019s quite possible that Schumer will have that majority soon: The GOP is already speculating about a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d next fall in which Trump, weakened by scandal, drags Republicans on the ballot down with him. It\u2019s easy to envision the GOP losing five seats, with Susan Collins, Martha McSally, and Joni Ernst all being outraised by their challengers last quarter and Cory Gardner and Thom Tillis facing very tough purple-state races. Worse, Trump is raking in so much dough with the RNC that it may be cutting into the amount of cash available from donors for Collins and the rest.\n\nLong story short, it\u2019s perfectly possible that the Senate will land at 50/50 with Warren as president-elect. In that scenario, Democrats would theoretically have the votes to nuke the filibuster, with Warren\u2019s VP providing the tiebreaking vote.\n\nBut now here\u2019s Sinema claiming that she\u2019ll provide the tiebreaking vote for the GOP. Do you see how big this is? It\u2019s the next best thing to Republicans picking up an extra Senate seat next fall. And if Sinema\u2019s true to her word, she would derail the entire Warren agenda. She\u2019d allow Republicans to filibuster everything that comes down the pike apart from the narrow class of legislation that can be passed with a simple majority under the rules of reconciliation.\n\nAnd best of all, it could conceivably last for the duration of Warren\u2019s term. Sinema isn\u2019t up for reelection to the Senate until 2024.\n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019d have the guts to be the lone holdout, though, certainly not for four years. If you think Senate Republicans are under a lot of pressure on impeachment, imagine Sinema singlehandedly obstructing the progressive program after Democrats won a landmark victory and took back government. She\u2019d be a bigger villain to Democrats than Mitch McConnell is. She\u2019d be primaried for sure in 2024 and, given Arizona\u2019s blue drift, it\u2019s plausible that she\u2019d lose. I think she\u2019d either cave on the filibuster after working out some sort of deal with President Warren, possibly ensuring Sinema a bit more input into the Democratic agenda, or she\u2019d be backed up by a few other Dem holdouts, with Joe Manchin the most obvious possibility. That is, I don\u2019t think there are any scenarios in which Schumer misses nuking the filibuster by a 49/51 margin. There may be one where he misses 48/52 or 47/53, though.", "description": "\u201cEveryone knows that I am very independent-minded.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/s-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
