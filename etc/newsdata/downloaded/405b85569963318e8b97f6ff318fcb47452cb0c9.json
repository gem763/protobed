If there is light at the end of the tunnel later this week, and heaven knows I hope there will be, we have a fundamental responsibility in this place to try and resolve this most vexed of problems and allow our despairing country to move on. For the health of our democracy and to restore faith in this most venerable of institutions, in my view we simply must get Brexit done.\n\nSeveral other Spartans are now on the government payroll, including Home Secretary Priti Patel, and are more likely to vote for a deal.\n\nAnd leading Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg, who voted against May's deal twice, said last week he was willing to compromise and \"eat my words\" after previously indicating he would vote against a deal.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party, which supports Brexit and lends Johnson's minority government 11 votes in parliament, has so far been cold towards Johnson's floated plan because it could involve keeping Northern Ireland in some sort of separate customs arrangement with the EU, to which the rest of the UK was not subject.\n\nBut Downing Street may not need those votes after indications from a handful of Labour MPs in Leave-voting seats who say they are willing to back a deal which has the EU's approval.\n\nIt comes amid fears that Labour could formally instruct MPs to back a second referendum instead of the general election which Boris Johnson is seeking.\n\nWhile the party's Jeremy Corbyn says an election is still his priority, he appears almost completely isolated with even his closest allies defying him and pushing for a confirmatory vote on any deal Johnson brings back.\n\nAbout 18 Labour MPs signed a letter last week urging the EU to work towards a deal, and said they were willing to consider backing a deal. Backbenchers including Melanie Onn, Stephen Kinnock, Gareth Snell, and Gloria De Piero have all indicated they are willing to back a deal.\n\nHowever, they are likely to come under intense pressure from colleagues who would accuse them of helping to deliver a Conservative-led Brexit and provide a major boost to Johnson's premiership.", "description": "Pro-Brexit MPs fear that another parliamentary defeat for a Brexit deal would tip the parliament in favour of calls for holding a second referendum.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da57a84cc4a0a07be2aea62?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
