One week they like a particular food, the next week, they want nothing to do with it.\n\nMy kids are no different, and chances are yours are the same.\n\nCereal was once a loved breakfast staple for my kids, but at some point, and there was no particular event that triggered it, they decided they no longer liked cereal.\n\nWhen looking for new recipes to try, I involved them so they could have a say. Thankfully, we found tons of recipes online and in recipe books.\n\nIf cereal is not a part of your kids\u2019 breakfast shortlist, how about trying some of the following recipes that I had luck with? All of these recipes can either be whipped up quickly in the morning, or be fully or partially pre-made for quick prep or warm-up at breakfast time.\n\n1. Overnight Oats\n\nThis breakfast idea has many flavour variations, so experiment until you find a few your kids like. Overnight oats can be prepped on the weekend and then enjoyed over the next few days.\n\nRecipes to try:\n\n2. Breakfast Cookies\n\nWhat can be better than cookies for breakfast? Breakfast cookies are a little different than regular cookies because they\u2019re packed with nutritious ingredients and contain less sugar (if any!).\n\nRecipes to try:\n\n3. Frozen Yogurt Bites\n\nThe great thing about this recipe is that you can pre-make a large batch and grab them out of the freezer when needed. Kids can also help with the prep, which makes it more likely they will eat them!\n\nRecipes to try:\n\n4. Smoothies\n\nSmoothies can be customized with any ingredients your kids like, and you can even sneak a good-for-them ingredient or two in and they won\u2019t be able to detect it! It\u2019s easy to come up with your own smoothie combos but here are a few recipes to start with if smoothie making is new to you.\n\nRecipes to try:\n\n5. Pancakes or Waffles\n\nMost waffles and pancakes can be made ahead and warmed up when it\u2019s breakfast time. Store either in the fridge or freezer and heat when ready.\n\nRecipes to try:\n\n6. Breakfast Burritos\n\nThis is a favourite in our home, for both me and the kids. For me, because they fill the kids up and I can make a big batch on the weekend and freeze it. It\u2019s a favourite for the kids because they can warm them up in the morning by themselves...and they\u2019re delicious!\n\nRecipes to try:\n\n7. Muffins\n\nServe a fruit or small smoothie alongside of a muffin that\u2019s packed with nutritious ingredients and your kids will have a filling breakfast that will satisfy them.\n\nRecipes to try:\n\n8. Granola\n\nYes, technically granola can be eaten as a cereal, the thing we\u2019re trying to avoid, but these out-of-the-box ideas won\u2019t remind your kids of cereal in any way.\n\nRecipes to try:\n\n9. Chia Pudding\n\nNot only are chia puddings delicious, they\u2019re also filling. There are also tons of flavour variations to choose from. Here are a few to start with.\n\nRecipes to try:\n\n10. Breakfast Popsicles\n\nImagine the look on your kids\u2019 faces when you tell them they\u2019re having popsicles for breakfast! These frozen treats are packed with nutritious ingredients and will likely become a new favourite at the breakfast table.\n\nRecipes to try:\n\nI hope some of these ideas help you when answering the big question: what\u2019s for breakfast? And of course, I hope your kids love them.", "description": "If cereal is not a part of your kids\u2019 breakfast shortlist, how about trying some of the following recipes that I had luck with?
