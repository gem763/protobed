Samples of the Presidio Grip, Presidio Pro, Presidio Stay Clear, and Presidio Clear+Glitter were sent along to evaluate. The Glitter case is priced at $44.95 while all of the others are $39.95.\n\nAll of the Speck products include Microban antimicrobial technology and 13-foot drop protection. Some greatly enhance your ability to hold onto your iPhone while others provide unfiltered ability to enjoy the look of your new iPhone 11.\n\nMost Presidio Speck cases have two to five color options to choose from and I was able to try out several colors for both the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nCheck out ZDNet's Jason Cipriani's first impressions of the iPhone 11.", "description": "Speck released new cases for the Apple iPhone 11 series that are designed to help you hold onto your phone and if you do drop it then to help protect it up to 13 feet.
