Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), currently the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, speaking on the House floor.\n\n\u201cI am greatly disappointed in the raw, unmasked, unbridled hatred and meanness that drives this impeachment coup-d\u2019etat. The unapologetic disregard for the voice of the people,\u201d she said.\n\nOthers Democrats highlighted in the clips included Pelosi, now-House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (Md.), now-Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.), Rep. Jim McGovern (Mass.), Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (Tex.) and Rep. Rosa L.

We can\u2019t wait to act.\u201d\n\nRep. Tim Ryan (Ohio) shared on Twitter that he had read the report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as straightforward as can be,\u201d Ryan said, alleging it detailed \u201cthird-rate, banana republic behavior.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe my Republican colleagues are going to ignore this,\u201d Ryan said in another tweet. \u201cWould they if our President was an Democrat?\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) also weighed in, writing on Twitter: \u201cDonald Trump solicited foreign interference in our elections from the Oval Office. He attempted to cover up his actions. And his appointees intervened, against the law, to attempt to suppress this whistleblower complaint.\u201d\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), meanwhile, highlighted a paragraph in the report and offered her assessment: \u201cThis is a coverup.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) later asserted in a statement that the whistleblower complaint was \u201conly the tip of an iceberg of corrupt, illegal and immoral behavior by this president.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the House must do is thoroughly investigate Trump\u2019s cover-up of this call and his other attempts to use government resources to help his re-election campaign,\u201d he said.\n\n9:20 a.m.: White House dismisses whistleblower complaint as \u2018third-hand accounts\u2019\n\nShortly after the whistleblower complaint was made public, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement.\n\n\u201cNothing has changed with the release of this complaint, which is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings \u2014 all of which shows nothing improper,\u201d she said.\n\n9:15 a.m.: Whistleblower claimed Trump abused his office and that White House officials tried to cover it up\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee has released the whistleblower complaint at the heart of the burgeoning controversy over Trump\u2019s July phone call with the Ukrainian president \u2014 an explosive document that claims not only that Trump misused his office for personal gain, but that unidentified White House officials tried to hide that fact.\n\n\u201cIn the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\u201d the whistleblower wrote in the complaint dated Aug. 12. \u201cThis interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President\u2019s main domestic political rivals. The President\u2019s personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General (William P.) Barr appears to be involved as well.\u201d\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Devlin Barrett\n\n8:45 a.m.: Trump lashes out at Democrats as whistleblower complaint is released\n\nMinutes after a whistleblower complaint was made public, Trump lashed out at Democrats in a tweet written in all capital letters in which he accused them of trying to destroy the Republican Party \u201cAND ALL THAT IT STANDS FOR.\u201d\n\n\u201cSTICK TOGETHER, PLAY THEIR GAME, AND FIGHT HARD REPUBLICANS.

It wasn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nIf they actually did this the markets would crash. Do you think it was luck that got us to the best Stock Market and Economy in our history. It wasn\u2019t! https://t.co/V0WGVWEWTN \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2019\n\nTrump also highlighted a tweet by his daughter Ivanka, a White House adviser, in which she thanked him for his work and included a photo of her father pumping his fist.\n\n\u201cSo cute! Her father is under siege, for no reason, since his first day in office!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nIn another, he wrote: \u201cTHE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!\u201d\n\n6:30 a.m.: Biden suggests a motive for Trump reaching out to Ukraine\n\nSpeaking at a fundraiser Wednesday night in Los Angeles, Biden said there was no proof of Trump\u2019s allegation that he and his son Hunter Biden had conflicts of interest while he served as vice president.\n\n\u201cThis is not about me, and it really isn\u2019t because not a single publication said anything he has ever said about me or my son is true,\u201d Biden said. \u201cEveryone has gone and researched it and said it\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nBiden suggested that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate him and his son because \u201c70-something polls show that I\u2019ll kick his \u2026 toes.\u201d The audience burst into laughter.\n\n6:15 a.m.: Some House Democrats fret as Pelosi forges ahead with impeachment\n\nAs his fellow House Democrats moved en masse toward impeaching Trump after months of hesitation, Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey could only watch in bewilderment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get surprised often,\u201d the freshman moderate said Wednesday, less than 24 hours after Pelosi dropped her own qualms and launched the House\u2019s official impeachment inquiry targeting Trump. \u201cBut really, truly, I just was like, \u2018Wow.\u2019 It happened so quickly.\u201d\n\nAs other Democrats proclaimed unity and resolve after Pelosi described the \u201cdishonorable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office,\u201d pledging to move quickly toward impeachment articles, Van Drew stood with a group of Democrats who say they continue to have reservations and fear a rash impeachment could obliterate the rest of the party\u2019s governing agenda, improve Trump\u2019s chances of reelection and imperil their own.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Mike DeBonis\n\n6 a.m.: Biden edges closer to calling for impeachment on \u2018Jimmy Kimmel Live!\u2019\n\nBiden edged closer to calling for impeachment on Wednesday night, pointing to a rough transcript of a conversation between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president as evidence that Trump is likely to have committed \u201can impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nBiden, who had stopped short of calling for the president to be ousted earlier this week, adjusted his stance after the White House shared the details of a 30-minute phone call Trump made to Zelensky in July. According to the 2,000-word rough transcript, Trump repeatedly suggested that Zelensky investigate Biden, offering help from the Justice Department and raising the possibility of inviting the foreign leader to the White House.\n\nWatch the video: Biden suggests rough transcript shows Trump committed \u2018an impeachable offense\u2019\n\n\u201cBased on the material that they acknowledged today, it seems to me it\u2019s awful hard to avoid the conclusion that it is an impeachable offense and a violation of constitutional responsibility,\u201d Biden said during an appearance on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d\n\nRed more here.\n\n\u2014 Allyson Chiu\n\n5 a.m.: 218 House Democrats support impeachment inquiry\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, there were now 217 House Democrats and Independent Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.) who support launching an impeachment inquiry, giving 218 votes to impeach Trump \u2014 the threshold number of votes needed to pass anything in the House.\n\nIn the past two days, 78 Democrats said they wanted the House to go through with an impeachment process. Before the whistleblower complaint news broke last week, there were 95 members total who supported doing so.\n\n\u201cToday, for the world to see, we learned in his own words that the President of the United States used the full weight of the most sacred office in the land to coerce a foreign leader in a way that undermines our democracy and threatens our national security,\u201d said Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), who came out for an impeachment inquiry Wednesday night.\n\nBut just because 218 lawmakers want the House to go through with the impeachment process, there\u2019s no guarantee that they would vote to impeach Trump at the end of it. Of the 218, only 25 have said they\u2019d vote to impeach the president right now.\n\nRead more here.", "description": "The president encouraged Republicans to stick together at the outset of what was shaping up as another dramatic day in Washington amid a Democratic drive for impeachment.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YUBQhaKMLNqfrsMNjsjwr29x_rU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RKTE4YXAIMI6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
