Japan is everyone\u2019s favorite underdog and more than likely to provide a number of crowd favorites, among them flyhalf Yu Tamura, resilient captain Michael Leitch and hooker Shota Horie, already a popular figure in Japan.\n\nFiji flanker Peceli Yato was a stand-out as the Pacific Islanders gave Australia a huge fright in Pool D before losing 39-21. The Flying Fijians have a number of players who could win star status at the World Cup, including flyhalf Ben Volavola whose skill and good looks have already won plenty of fans.\n\nReplacement hooker Julian Montoya scored two tries from mauls as Argentina came close to pulling off the biggest comeback in Rugby World Cup history in a 23-21 loss to France.\n\nThere was no more dominating figure in the Pool B blockbuster between New Zealand and South Africa than Savea, who carried the ball for 62 meters, made eight tackles and won two turnovers. Savea\u2019s punishing runs contributed to both of New Zealand\u2019s tries.\n\nSurprisingly, the Man of the Match award went to All Blacks fullback Beauden Barrett whose contribution was less imporant but more conspicuous.\n\nBefore the match Barrett had singled out Savea as a player central to the All Blacks\u2019 game plan.\n\n\u201cHis work rate is immense,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cThe influence he is on a rugby game when it comes to the breakdown, but then you see him run around wingers on the edges. He\u2019s probably our most influential player in terms of work rate that we have at the moment.\u201d\n\nThis World Cup may be Savea\u2019s breakout moment on the world stage. He began his international career in the shadow of his brother, All Blacks winger Julian Savea, and has taken time to establish himself in New Zealand\u2019s starting lineup, making most of impressive forays from the bench.\n\nAs openside flanker, he has been ranked behind starting No. 7 Sam Cane. But the absence from the New Zealand squad of blindside flanker Liam Squire has seen Savea take over the No. 6 jersey. Though he is considered small by regular standards for a No. 6, the All Blacks have been able to deploy him in a way which makes maximum use of his skills.\n\nIreland may have a player who can match Savea\u2019s backrow skills. Flanker C.J. Stander was superb in Ireland\u2019s 27-3 Pool A win over Scotland, making 43 meters in 15 carries, adding nine tackles and one clean line break.\n\n\u201cWe put in a lot of effort over the pre-season, we trained well and it\u2019s just a start so we\u2019re looking forward to the next game,\u201d Stander said. \u201cWe can\u2019t look back on it too much because we\u2019re playing in six days time.\u201d\n\nOther stand outs over the first weekend of the tournament included lock Federico Ruzza, who was voted player of the match in Italy\u2019s 47-22 win over Namibia, though he spent only 44 minutes on the field.\n\nPowerful center Manu Tuilagi scored two tries in England\u2019s patchy 35-3 win over Tonga, and emphasized he remains a challenge to any defense.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "All Blacks backrower Ardie Savea is among players whose performances on the opening weekend of the Rugby World Cup put them among the leaders in the race to become the star of the tournament.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Mcmorran"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/japan_rugby_wcup_australia_fiji_71725_c0-41-3682-2187_s1770x1032.jpg?ae78ed870136bcec1dcd0d445884da02f6f7448c", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
