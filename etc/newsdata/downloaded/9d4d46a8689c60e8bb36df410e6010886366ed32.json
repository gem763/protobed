Mike Lee is pushing the outsourcing bill, and it would allow U.S. and Indians firms to reward 60,000 Indian workers a year with citizenship \u2014 if they agree to take Americans\u2019 jobs at low wages. The bill would also encourage many additional Indians to take sweatshop jobs in the United States via the little-known OPT, CPT, B1, and TN work visas so they can compete for entry into the H-1B green-card program.\n\nU.S. investors, Indian outsourcing companies, and the Indian government have put at least 600,000 Indians into U.S. college jobs \u2014 and also have sent at least one million more jobs to India \u2014 via this little-recognized \u201cU.S.-Indian Outsourcing Economy\u201d:\n\nIndia's ambassador explains why Indian gov't & biz are pushing HR.1044 & S.386 green-card/country-caps bill. Bonus: He thanks Dem/GOP Representatives for helping India's economic strategy with vote to outsource more US graduates' jobs to Indian H-1B/OPTs. https://t.co/xjSDjwYaEL \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) July 25, 2019\n\nThis expanding industry is having a huge impact on the salaries and job prospects of middle-aged American professionals, just as factory-job outsourcing had a huge impact on Americans in the Midwest.\n\nIn 2017, Wolf was picked to serve as chief of staff to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. He got the job because he also worked at DHS for President George W. Bush, who promoted an \u201cany willing worker\u201d policy. The policy would have allowed U.S. employers to hire cheap workers from around the world. As Nielsen lost clout before being fired, Wolf shifted to a policy job at DHS.\n\nTrump has several options for replacing McAleenan. The alternative candidates include Ken Cuccinelli, who now runs U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Mark Morgan, who is the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nTrump may also hire an outsider to help run DHS, which must build almost 500 miles of border wall before November 2020, even as it also manages the border, regulates the visa program, oversees the Secret Service, conducts diplomacy with Central American nation and also develop cyberdefenses against hackers paid by foreign governments.\n\nNASSCOM was created in 1988 to help U.S. investors use India\u2019s growing pool of low-wage, English-speaking graduates as H-1B workers. The group\u2019s 28-member council includes representatives from Microsoft, Accenture, Intel, Amazon, Cisco, IBM India, Genpact India, Hewlett-Packard, and Dell.\n\nNASSCOM is important to India\u2019s government because it brings tens of billions of dollars to India\u2019s developing economy. In 2015, for example, India\u2019s prime minister spoke at a NASSCOM celebration:\n\nThe group\u2019s website says that \u201cNASSCOM is dedicated to expanding India\u2019s role in the global IT order by creating a conducive business environment, simplifying policies and procedures, promoting intellectual capital and strengthening the talent pool.\u201d\n\nNASSCOM\u2019s U.S. and Indian companies earn stock market rewards by arbitraging the huge pay differential between U.S. and India by moving Indian graduates into U.S. jobs and U.S. jobs to Indian graduates in India. This U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy has proved so successful that salaries for U.S. graduates have grown slowly since the 1990s and are now growing slower than blue-collar salaries.\n\nThis process is described in a new discrimination lawsuit against one of the Indian-owned outsourcing firms, Larsen & Toubro Infotech.\n\nThe firm won a technology support contract from Iconix Brand Group in New York. The support was managed by one American employee of Larsen & Toubro, according to the lawsuit filed by the D.C. firm Kotchen & Low. The single American ran a New York team, which consisted of roughly eight Indians who likely arrived with H-1B visas, the lawsuit says. But the single American also ran a team of 20 Indians in India, and he reported to two Indian managers in India. So the visa programs allowed the Indian company to take roughly 30 good jobs from U.S. white-collar workers with just eight visas, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe use of cheaper Indian labor created payroll savings for Iconix and profits for Larsen. In turn, those profits boosted the company\u2019s stock values for U.S. investors, including the Vanguard Total International Stock Index.\n\nMany major U.S. firms have outsourced work to India. For example, Walmart is also boosting its stock value by outsourcing 569 finance and accounting jobs in North Carolina to cheaper H-1B workers from India. If the company saves $10,000 per employee, Walmart will save $5.7 million per year. On Wall Street, Walmart\u2019s price to earnings rate is 25 to 1, so the $5.7 million in payroll savings will boost its stockholders\u2019 value by $142 million.\n\nWalmart picked an American company, Genpact, to supply the foreign workers. The company is a spin-off of General Electric, and it prospers by providing Indian H-1B workers to many companies in the United States. For example, the company asked for 271 H-1Bs in 2018, 410 H-1Bs in 2017, and 307 H-1Bs in 2016. In 2018, Genpact also got 160 L-1 visas, which allow Indian employees to work in the United States at Indian-level wages.\n\nGenpact\u2019s $3.3 billion in revenue is enough to generate $7.5 billion in stock value for its investors, which include Bain Capital, BlackRock, and Charles Schwab Investment Management.\n\nWalmart is hoping to expand into India, so it needs strong support from the Indian government as it competes with Jeff Bezos\u2019s Amazon for shares of India\u2019s huge retail market.\n\nSen. Mike Lee\u2019s pro-NASSCOM legislation is stalled amid opposition from Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin.\n\nNo GOP senator has denounced Lee\u2019s bill, and the Trump administration has not said if the president supports or opposes the legislation:", "description": "A former lobbyist for India's huge job-outsourcing industry is a top candidate to take over the Department of Homeland Security.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Chad-Wolf-Kirstjen-Nielsen-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
