He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later it\u2019s on to a new enemy and new crisis.\u201d\n\nAnd below is the reference to the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center (Trump refers to the World Trade Center in a separate section of the book, but it is unrelated to terrorism):\n\n\u201cI really am convinced we\u2019re in danger of the sort of terrorist attacks that will make the bombing of the Trade Center look like kids playing with firecrackers. No sensible analyst rejects this possibility, and plenty of them, like me, are not wondering if but when it will happen.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Trump knew Osama bin Laden was a threat to America. And he thought America was at risk of a major terrorist attack. But he did not write about those two things as being intertwined.", "description": "", "authors": ["J.M.
