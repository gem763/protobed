I knew there would be off-the-scale readings on the blood tests.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images/Tetra images RF)\n\nHe also admitted that he had not stopped using steroid despite his partner and parents knew about it.\n\n\"When I started out taking steroids, my parents found bottles in our house so this hasn't been a shock to them,\" he added.\n\nBut soon as he realised the damage it has done to his body, he has changed his view of the drugs.\n\nHe said in the programme: \"The good thing about anabolic steroids is most - and it's not all but most - of the problems they cause can be reversed.\n\n\"It's good time for me to find out what damage I've done and reverse it. And it let other people see what the risks are.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nDarren said the drugs are 'endemic' in gyms across Scotland nowadays.\n\n\"I believe steroids are very abused these days - far more than when I started out,\" he said.\n\n\"When I started taking them, there was me and my mate taking them in the full gym.\n\n\"You'd have to know someone.\n\n\"Now I walk into the gym and, out of 10 guys I see, I would say eight are using - it's that rife.\n\n\"This isn't in specialised gyms for bodybuilders but commercial gyms you see in every town.\"\n\nHe believed Internet shopping helps making the drugs more accessible.\n\nDarren said: \"They are so easy to get online that you can get them to your door via the Royal Mail the day after ordering them.\"\n\nDespite the dangerous side effects, Darren does not support an all-out ban.\n\nHe said: \"There\u2019s no safe ways to use steroids but there are careful ways and I think I\u2019ve been careful over the years. Would I change anything? Probably not.\n\n\"The only thing I\u2019d tell a younger me would be to be more careful and make more checks on their effects.\"", "description": "Darren suffered high blood pressure, temporary loss of libido and other adverse effects during a decade of steroid abuse", "authors": ["Gordon Blackstock", "Tiffany Lo", "Image", "Getty Images Tetra Images Rf", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658459.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS196152480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
