But now I\u2019m trying to keep a mature head.\n\n'There have been times where I\u2019ve lapsed and done a few silly things and gone on a few silly dates that I probably shouldn\u2019t have gone on.\n\n'But I don\u2019t want to see her hurt, I still care about her. I'm not a malicious person.'", "description": "TOWIE star James Lock has slammed claims he's dating Ellie MacKenzie and says even his mum disapproved of their passionate kiss.
