That's the bottom line. What can you say?\n\n'We were discussing his best position. I probably think it is a six, Owen thinks it is an eight. Really, once we start arguing about it, he cant do either role that well.'\n\nSince joining last season, Fred has played just 31 games in all competitions and has scored a single goal.\n\nOwen Hargreaves insisted Fred was a better player than he showed, but admitted that something was not right with the Brazil international.\n\nFred was roundly criticised by BT Sport pundits Owen Hargreaves (R) and Michael Owen (C)\n\nHargreaves said: 'Regardless of where you play, you can't afford to give the ball away as much as he did today and he gave it away it a lot.\n\n'I think there is a really good player in there, I just don't know why we are seeing him play like this. He had some terrific games at Shakhtar, that is why Manchester City were interested in him.\n\n'Today was not the level that he is up to. He is really good on the ball normally, he has two feet, whether it is a confidence thing.\n\n'It was a big opportunity for him to step up today and play really well and he did the opposite.'\n\nHargreaves added: 'You had Lindelof, Matic, Fred, that's a lot of money you can expect more shots on target. This is what you expect when Man United play away from home and it's not much offensively.'", "description": "Manchester United flop Fred endured another awful display in his club's 0-0 Europa League draw at AZ Alkmaar.
