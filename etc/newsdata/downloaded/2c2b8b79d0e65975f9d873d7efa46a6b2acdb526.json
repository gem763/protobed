One very happy customer.\"\n\nThey've also proved a hit in the popular Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK Facebook group, where a post from one user has attracted more than 350 comments.\n\n(Image: Wilko)\n\nThe post say the blinds can be cut to size 'extremely easily' and come with clips which allow you to keep them at a set height.\n\nOne commented: \"I had mine from Wilko and it's brilliant!\"\n\nAnother said: \"So easy to put up and I cut mine to size with a craft knife.\"\n\nMembers also compared them to Ikea's bargain version , which can also fit any window and are even cheaper at just \u00a33.50.\n\nOne post read: \"They're great for awkward sized windows!\"\n\nAt such a low price, they're both certainly worth a go.", "description": "Happy customers have said the Wilko bargain 'could easily pass for professionally fitted blinds'", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Extreme Couponing", "Bargains Uk Group", "Wilko"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565107.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Wilk-bargain-blinds-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
