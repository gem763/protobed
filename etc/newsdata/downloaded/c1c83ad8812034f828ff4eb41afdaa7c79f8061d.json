Let's just accept people for who they are and live as our true, authentic selves. Being who you are is not a disease.'\n\nA row over gay giraffes has split the upper ranks of Labour party after MP Dawn Butler is ridiculed by senior advisers for suggesting 99 per cent of the animals are sexually attracted to their own gender\n\nShe added that the giraffes showed it was invalid for critics to claim LGBT teaching could turn straight children gay.\n\nThis drew an angry response from Lachlan Stuart, Mr Corbyn's senior adviser on domestic policy, who used Twitter to cite several scientific papers that challenge Ms Butler's claim.\n\nAfter surreally declaring that giraffes were his 'favourite animal', Mr Stuart said the way male giraffes behaved with each other was 'not gay behaviour' because 'there's no romance. No courtship. No affection. No pair bonding'.\n\nMr Stuart said studies showed that while male giraffes do engage in some sexual activities with younger males, they only do so to assert authority.\n\nDawn Butler, Labour's Shadow Secretary for Women and Equalities, gave a rambling after-dinner speech defending the teaching of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues in schools\n\nHe said: 'Is there any truth to this claim? In short, no, there isn't. It is a ludicrous, offensive, homophobic claim... do you get why it's completely f****** offensive? It's akin to describing Deliverance [the 1972 American thriller film] as a 'gay romance' because the effete city boys are put in their place by the locals by getting beaten and then raped.'\n\nBut are claims just a tall story? Dawn Butler's claim about the sexual leanings of giraffes appears to have been drawn from the book Biological Exuberance, in which author Bruce Bagemihl identifies homosexuality in more than 450 species of mammals, birds, reptiles and insects. Bagemihl says 94 per cent of male giraffes exhibit homosexual behaviour, including necking, caressing, courting and mounting. Only one per cent of female giraffes show same-sex activity. He writes: 'During an exhaustive study of giraffes in the Arusha and Tarangire national parks of Tanzania, researchers recorded 17 homosexual mounts and one heterosexual mount in more than a year (and 3,200 hours) of observation\u2026 heterosexual mating appeared to be genuinely rare.' But other studies dispute this, claiming the behaviour is to allow dominant males to assert themselves over more submissive rivals for the females. One group of researchers said that male giraffes 'seemed interested in much more coupling' than they achieved.\n\nWithout naming Ms Butler, Mr Stuart added: 'I'm really sick and tired now of straight, white, male, young advisers (and that's who they all are) delivering such foolish words into the mouths of people I'm supposed to respect.\n\n'Stay in your lanes, boys, because you don't get this at all.'\n\nDuring her expletive-filled speech, Ms Butler also referred to The Mail on Sunday's report earlier this month that the Government had shelved plans to amend the Gender Recognition Act to make it easier for people to self-identify as male or female regardless of their sex at birth, because it was so contentious.\n\nShe said: 'What the f***? Once upon a time, being a working woman was contentious, once upon a time being gay was contentious.\n\n'Who gives a s***? Just amend the Act already\u2026 trans people are not the problem, it's the delay that's the problem.\n\n'Let's stop the bulls***. Trying to weaponise the trans issue is so dark that it's not even worth mentioning\u2026\n\n'I don't want anyone in this room to be tolerated. I don't want to be tolerated as a black woman, I want to be accepted. I want everyone in this room to be accepted.'\n\nA source close to Ms Butler said she was making the point that you cannot teach people to be gay.\n\nBut the source said Ms Butler appreciated the clarification in Mr Stuart's tweets.", "description": "Dawn Butler gave a rambling after-dinner speech defending the teaching of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues in schools during which she used giraffes as an example.", "authors": ["Glen Owen Political Editor For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/01/20231382-0-image-a-33_1572138469164.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
