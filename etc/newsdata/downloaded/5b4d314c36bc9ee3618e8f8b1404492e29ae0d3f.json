(Disclaimer: I am a diehard A24 fan and I am very interested, so I feel comfortable making that claim.) They\u2019re a little bit bigger than a standard novel, coming in at 8 x 11 inches, but not exactly coffee table books. It\u2019s unclear if A24 is going to do this for every movie, but I certainly hope so. Where is my Lady Bird book, A24?\n\nThis isn't the first time that A24, only a seven-year-old production studio that nonetheless has 25 Academy Awards nominations under its belt, has produced some cool physical companions for its movies. On top of standard merchandise, including mugs, sweaters, and enamel pins, A24 has also produced zines a number of its movies, including Bo Burnham\u2019s critically acclaimed Eighth Grade and Jonah Hill\u2019s skateboarding coming-of-age film mid90s. A24 even created a classic fingerboard toy for mid90s, which is naturally sold out.\n\nThe books go on sale on September 30th for $60. They can be purchased on A24\u2019s online store.", "description": "A24 gained recognition and prominence within the film industry for producing powerful, award-winning movies like Moonlight, Eighth Grade, and Midsommar, and now the studio is giving a few of those films the book treatment.
