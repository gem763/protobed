Kennedy to the presidency, his brother Bobby to the role of attorney general, and their youngest brother, Teddy, to the U.S. Senate at the ripe young age of 30. It\u2019s what drew Bobby and Teddy into challenging incumbent Democratic presidents in 1968 and 1980.\n\nNow Bobby\u2019s grandson, Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III, is following the same playbook. Despite some rather heavy criticism from fellow Democrats, Kennedy appears poised to challenge incumbent Democratic Sen. Ed Markey.\n\nKennedy, a 38-year-old Democrat who was elected to Congress in 2012, is expected to announce soon \u2014 perhaps as early as next week \u2014 that he has decided to run for the seat that Markey won in 2013.\n\nMarkey is trying to head off the challenge at the pass. His best shot might be to keep Kennedy from running by stressing the damage it would do to the national Democratic Party in 2020, a year when the party\u2019s main focus will be defeating President Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be brutal,\u201d one senior Senate Democratic aide said of a yearlong primary battle between Kennedy and Markey. (The primary in Massachusetts is not until September 2020.)\n\n\u201cI called Joe and told him I hoped he wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d former Rep. Barney Frank, who represented parts of Boston and its southern suburbs in Congress for 32 years, told Yahoo News. \u201cHaving these primary fights when there are no issues weakens us when we need to beat Republicans.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarkey got perhaps his most significant endorsement so far on Friday when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 29-year-old freshman lawmaker from New York who co-sponsored the Green New Deal legislation with Markey, released a video heartily endorsing his reelection and making arguments that cut against Kennedy\u2019s youthful appeal.\n\nWe have to do more than take back the WH.\n\n\n\nWe must do so w/ a stronger Democratic Party that fights for working people - & that includes newcomers+longtime fighters.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m proud to endorse my #GreenNewDeal co-author + climate champion @EdMarkey for Senate.pic.twitter.com/WrYmTaJrnn \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 13, 2019\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not just resting on his record of the past,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said of Markey. \u201cHe\u2019s aggressively pursuing an agenda for the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a time right now when we have to have conversations not just about holding this administration accountable, but changing the Democratic Party for the future, Ed Markey has a very critical role in making sure that climate change, as well as a bevy of other issues \u2014 health care and beyond \u2014 are critical core issues in how we fight for working people and working families in the United States,\u201d she said.\n\nMarkey will speak to the Massachusetts Democratic State Convention on Saturday in Springfield. Kennedy will not, but the congressman will be working the room while Markey stands onstage.\n\nFrank said he still thinks there\u2019s a chance Kennedy will back off the challenge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say there\u2019s a chance he wouldn\u2019t run. Joe has a very good reputation for being a guy who really is public-spirited and works well with others,\u201d Frank said. \u201cHe\u2019s running into some flak. \u2026 He may decide it\u2019s more than he wants to deal with.\u201d\n\nBut Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic consultant in the state who has worked for Ted Kennedy and former Sen. John Kerry, said there\u2019s no way Kennedy will back down.\n\n\u201cJoe is running. Period. Full stop,\u201d she wrote in an email to Yahoo News.\n\nIn a phone interview, Marsh predicted that it will be Markey who drops out, potentially just a few weeks from now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be looking at Columbus Day,\u201d she said. \u201cThe longer this goes on and the more he\u2019s out campaigning, the more he\u2019s going to realize how hard this is going to be.\u201d\n\nMarsh said she expects Kennedy to announce next week or the week after, and pointed to a recent Boston Globe/Suffolk poll that showed Kennedy ahead of Markey by 14 points in a head-to-head matchup.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how he digs himself out of this,\u201d she said.\n\nMarkey won his seat in a special election to replace Kerry, who was named secretary of state by then-President Barack Obama. In the Democratic primary that year, he defeated Rep. Stephen Lynch in an election in which 542,704 Democrats cast ballots.", "description": "Rep.
