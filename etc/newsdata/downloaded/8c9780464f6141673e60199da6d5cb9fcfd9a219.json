It joined hands with Nestle to launch the \"Big Vegan TS\" plant-based burger in Germany and \"The Big Vegan\" burger in Israel. It also offers the \"McVegan\" burger in Sweden.\n\n\"A lot of people have been asking McDonald's if they are going to do this. I do think to offer the consumer another option is nice, but again, it remains to be seen on what the uptake is,\" said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones.\n\nYarbrough pointed to Tim Horton's, owned by Canada's Restaurant Brands International <QSR.TO, which recently pulled back its own Beyond Meat plant-based burger offering this month, citing the better demand for real beef burgers.\n\nMcDonald's said the 12-week test would allow it learn more about real-world implications of serving the PLT, including customer demand and impact on restaurant operations.\n\nSeparately, Nestle on Thursday launched its \"Awesome\" vegan burger patties in the United States. The company already sells vegan burgers in several European countries under the Garden Gourmet brand.
