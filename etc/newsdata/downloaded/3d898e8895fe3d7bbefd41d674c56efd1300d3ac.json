But when the chips are down, McDonald\u2019s often wins\n\nStorm clouds are gathering over Rutland. If the council approves a planning application for a site on the outskirts of Oakham, the county will become the last in England to get a McDonald\u2019s. The fast food chain says it would bring 65 jobs, half of them full-time. Many residents are against the idea, though. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting \u2013 Oakham is not the place for it,\u201d Sandra Wells told the council. \u201cI\u2019m proud that Rutland is the only county not to have a McDonald\u2019s,\u201d another resident said.\n\nEnvironmentally, politically and aesthetically, McDonald\u2019s riles people like few other companies, and battles can turn ugly fast. If recent history is anything to go by, the company\u2019s opponents in Rutland would be forgiven for feeling discouraged.\n\nThis summer, despite a petition signed by 921 people, McDonald\u2019s was given permission to open a drive-thru in the Lake District town of Ulverston. \u201cIt will cause so much litter,\u201d the petition said. \u201cUlverston will become obese!!\u201d\n\nLast October, the town of Dolus d\u2019Ol\u00e9ron on the island of Ol\u00e9ron off the French Atlantic coast, lost a four-year legal battle to prevent a McDonald\u2019s drive-thru being built. The mayor, Gr\u00e9gory Gendre, originally refused permission, but a court later ruled that the decision was unlawful. Gendre continued the fight, with the help of public donations and a petition of nearly 83,000 signatures. When they lost, however, it left the town with \u20ac105,000 to pay in fines. And it will soon have a McDonald\u2019s anyway.\n\nIn the town of Tecoma, in Victoria, Australia, local people who did not want a McDonald\u2019s ended up in physical confrontations with the police. In 2011, the council had ruled against McDonald\u2019s, but the decision was later overturned. Protesters responded by planting a community garden, organising a march of 4,000 people and occupying the site on a 24-hour basis until they were forcibly removed. The restaurant was picketed when it opened in 2014 and the protests continued there for years. Today it is still open.\n\nIf the protesters of Rutland want encouragement, they are better off looking at Tavistock in Devon. A new McDonald\u2019s was boycotted on opening there in 1997, then closed nine years later for lack of customers. The best weapon against McDonald\u2019s, it seems, is simply not eating there.", "description": "The fast food chain\u2019s possible arrival has caused a (Mc)flurry of criticism.
