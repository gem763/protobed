Dave's mobile phone either superglued to his hand, or else it lives life inside his pocket, next to his trouser snake. Eventually, when it makes its way out into the light (the phone, not the trouser snake), Dave puts his mobile face down on the kitchen bench. Come to think of it, he puts it face down on the bedside table, or when he's at the pub, flat on the bar. Dave's phone is rarely is facing up.\n\nBut what could this mean? Is it a red flag that Dave is dodgy? Or is he just a phone down kind of guy? Naturally, Boyfriend Dave could just as likely be Girlfriend Grace, who also has phone face down preferences.\n\nTo get some insight, check out this survey by extramarital affair site Ashley Madison, who asked 1,500 philanderers the question of how they communicated. The answer? 56% of cheaters used their mobile phone as their prime source of contact. Next came email at 44%; in third place were dating sites with 20% of respondents communicating on the sly; followed by social media DM's at 20%; and finally, 11% used a secret phone. So, no wonder we may get a little paranoid when we realise we never see our lover's screensaver shining up at us. But is there really something they doesn't want you to see? Or is your partner maybe just organising your surprise 30th birthday cruise? The internet has been dating this dilemma, as this meme makes the rounds and getting a very mixed reaction:\n\nThis meme had the internet divided. Source:\n\n\"With my ex he used to do this all the time I didn't think anything of it until I did the washing he left his phone in his pant and I pulled it out and it lot up with messaged from 4 other girls sending pics and shit and him saying he can't wait to see them again and shit like that, I let it go and then lost my shit and moved out, my current boyfriend used to do it and it gave me anxiety and I talked to him about it and and he wasn't doing anything he couldn't give a shit about anyone else he just throws his phone and however it lands lands.\"\n\n\"Phone always on them, phone always locked up like fort knox, weird about phone password, phone on silent, phone screen always closing as you approach, phone always taken to toilet and shower, secret vault type apps on phone, running back in with worried look on your face to grab forgotten phone, yes. password on and set to silent thats what my cheating wife was doing. Also hid phone in her bra all the time all of a sudden.\"\n\n\"Nope. I mean I leave my phone everywhere possible. I loose it half the time. And it's majority facing down lol!\"\n\nWant to read more stories like this?

Everything you need to know about someone's true nature lies in their missed call list, inside messages, on Whatsapp, via email, or in the DM's of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Wechat, Viber and Kik accounts. It would make sense for a cheat to put their phone face down, especially when you consider how emails, texts, or messenger notifications with their snippets of conversations could incriminate someone who is being unfaithful.\n\nAccording to Melissa Ferrari, a Sydney-based psychotherapist, counsellor and couples therapist, what you really should be looking for is a change in behaviour.\n\n\u201cA phone that is suddenly placed face-down after being years with someone would be a possible red flag,\" she says. \u201cThe truth is that by the time the phone is switched to silent and face down means that you have likely missed numerous red flags upon the journey. A big one is your partner seeming more distracted, less interested in you, kind of like they are elsewhere. Another would be your partner being less available psychologically and physically to you, and the one that people don't often consider is if your partner begins doing things less as a couple and more independent of you.\u201d\n\nBefore facedown phone, there can be a lot of red flags to look out for.

Beyond having a full-on sexual affair, is it micro-cheating covertly by communicating online with a former flame, sliding into some Insta-famous hot girls DM's in the hope of some pathetic validation of their attractiveness, doing the same on a dating app, sexting a woman they'll never meet - or all of the above?\n\nFerrari says couples get into trouble with flirting because the boundaries are not clear. \"Being clear on what your relationship is such as being monogamous, poly-amorous, long-term, short-term needs to be clear from the start, particularly in the modern age, where anything goes in comparison to relationships of the past,\" she says.\n\nParanoia the destroyer\n\nIt's also worth noting that some people are more vulnerable to being overly paranoid and start to see infidelity when there is none.\n\n\u201cThis can be due to childhood trauma, or just how they have been shaped psychologically in the relationships they have had,\" explains Ferrari. \u201cWhen you do enter into a new relationship after an infidelity, being open and honest about what you have gone through, so your new partner can understand the importance of trust, will be critical to building a safe, secure and successful relationship.\u201d\n\nHowever, she says this does not mean that your intuition should be ignored, as intuition can tell you a lot about your relationship. \"If it's telling you that your partner may be cheating, then first qualify it by looking for the key signs like your partner appearing more distant, investing more in their appearance. Even them suddenly wanting more sex than usual can be a sign that their hormones are in overdrive through someone else being interested in them. If you have intuited that your partner may be being unfaithful, and you also see some other behaviours that connect with that thought, then it may be a good time to investigate further or even challenge them as to what is going on.\"\n\nIntuition can tell you a lot about your relationship.

By being open and transparent, this will help offset those negative thoughts and feelings. With the ease of communication, today opportunities to cheat have never been easier, so seeking assurances from your partner is OK around the issue of infidelity, of course, if you are continually seeking reassurances, then this a sign that something is seriously wrong with the relationship.\"", "description": "Should you be jumping to the worst conclusion if there's a facedown phone in your relationship?", "authors": ["Lollie Barr"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/be79877d54c0de6dc0d79f3f8db2c7aa", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
