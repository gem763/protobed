As especially low-lying cities like Miami Beach already deal with the effects of a warmer planet, the era of GOP ignorance-is-bliss appears to be over. This week, the Republican-controlled Florida Senate held a meeting to determine how lawmakers might mitigate climate damage on a basic infrastructural level.\n\n\u201cWe lost a decade,\u201d said Republican state senator Tom Lee, the chair of the Committee on Infrastructure and Security. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a lot of conversation about this. I understand that, and I understand why.\u201d In the meeting, as relayed by the Miami Herald, Lee did not mention Scott\u2019s reported ban on the subject. Hearing from experts on the challenges ahead, the committee addressed sea-level rise, infrastructure, and how local governments have dealt with climate resiliency projects despite state-level reluctance. One major problem that came up in the meeting is that, for the past decade, the Florida Department of Transportation has been planning and building infrastructure projects based on a one-foot sea level rise, when a two-foot change is expected as early as 2060.\n\nDespite setting a low bar of good intentions, Republican senators made no effort to translate their concern into policy, stopping short of saying \u201cthe Republican governor and the GOP leadership of the House and Senate, as well as the development, utility and insurance industries that finance them, will support\u201d the new acceptance of climate change, according to the Herald. Climate nihilism, a reliable bastion of conservative climate inaction, also reared its head when GOP state senator Travis Hutson asked what the point of changing state policy was if China and India continue to produce greenhouse gases.\n\nHutson\u2019s perspective is still the dominant view of the national party and the Trump administration. On Thursday, Mick Mulvaney announced that the G7 conference would be held at the Trump National Doral Miami resort in 2020. Aside from the obvious grift of hosting the Group of Seven at a Trump resort (from which the president has not divested) that is losing money, Mulvaney also announced that \u201cclimate change will not be on the agenda.\u201d", "description": "Republican state Senator Tom Lee said that the Florida GOP \u201clost a decade\u201d to climate denialism, during the tenure of former Governor Rick Scott, who reportedly banned using the phrases \u201cclimate change\u201d and \u201cglobal warming.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/17/17-florida-gop.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
