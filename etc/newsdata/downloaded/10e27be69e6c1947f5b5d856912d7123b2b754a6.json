Having worked closely with McLaren in the past, and seen the benefits of their technology and processes, this was an opportunity I jumped at.\n\n\u201cMy relationship with Rod goes way back, and he\u2019s been instrumental in helping me develop as a rider and a person. I can\u2019t wait to join my new team-mates and do everything I can to help us achieve the successes I know will come.\u201d\n\nThe move for Cavendish comes at the end of a lean spell in his career. His move to Dimension Data began well with four stage wins on the 2016 Tour, but he has not added to that tally since.\n\nHis 2017 Tour was ended on stage four by a crash, and he has since endured a long battle with the Epstein-Barr virus, which was initially misdiagnosed.\n\nHe will end the 2019 season without a victory on the road, but has looked in good form as he has enjoyed success on the track at Six Day London this week.\n\nThat event may herald a tilt at the Tokyo Olympics next year, though that is yet to be discussed with his new employers.\n\nCavendish is joining an ambitious team, which has moved to replace former Tour winner Vincenzo Nibali with the signings of Mikel Landa and Wout Poels for 2020, while they already have 29-year-old sprinter Sonny Colbrelli on their books.\n\n\u201cMark\u2019s signing completes our rider roster for 2020 and gives us the balance the team needs to win,\u201d Ellingworth said.\n\n\u201cMark is a proven champion and has a lot to contribute \u2013 both on and off the bike. Having last worked with him at the 2016 Rio Olympics and Qatar World Championships, I\u2019ve been delighted to see that his energy and determination to succeed are greater now than ever.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything in our power to enable him to perform at his best.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Mark Cavendish has said he \u201cjumped at\u201d the chance to join Bahrain Merida from next season as the Middle-East based team expands its partnership with automotive brand McLaren.
