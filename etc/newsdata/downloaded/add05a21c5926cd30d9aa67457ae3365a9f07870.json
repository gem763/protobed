It made him the youngest double centurion in List A cricket. He is only 17, and already his story is one of inspiration. There is a bright future for him and who knows, we may see him in the senior side soon? But enough of that. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. His story till now is no less inspiring.\n\nThis story has to be rewinded to 2013 to Azad Maidan in Mumbai. An 11-year-old cricket aspirant who wanted to make a name for himself in the game was pretty much taking his first steps. Yes, this young man was Yashasvi. But it was not just cricket that took up his day.\n\nCricinfo\n\nThe day time was for playing or training while in the evening he would sell pani puris on the street. His bed for the night was one of the groundsmen's tents. Many times it would be on an empty stomach.\n\nBut all that has paid off now. His double century is an enormous feat but it should hardly come as a surprise. For the Indian Under-19 side, he slammed 173 vs South Africa towards the start of this year. He has an average over 50 in the format and is a budding talent.\n\nCricinfo\n\nIt was coach Jwala Singh who spotted him for the first time and it was Mumbai where Yashasvi came at an early age, that his cricketing career began to take off.\n\n\"My parents live in a small town in Utter Pradesh, Bhadohi. It's near Varanasi. I had come to Mumbai very early with my father, who had work here. Once I came, I wanted to play. I used to play cricket earlier also in UP. Once we were in Mumbai, I was playing casually in Azad Maidan, and I liked it. I was interested only in cricket from an early age. I had thought that I want to play for Mumbai, because Sachin sir has played from Mumbai,\" he was quoted as saying by Cricinfo.\n\nYashasvi is a huge fan of Sachin Tendulkar and is certainly showing signs of talent early. Jwala helped him financially and it eventually helped him break into the Mumbai team. He is getting better with time and one hopes to see him at the top level soon,\n\nCricinfo\n\nBut despite all his early success, the boy is grounded by reality.\n\n\"My parents don't have any extravagant needs, they just want me to play cricket well. There is nothing that will make them more proud than me representing my country. Other than that, apart from a place to stay and food to eat, they don't want anything,\" he said.\n\nBut he is hungry for runs, and we hope he gets tons of them. All the best Yashasvi, you have a long way to go, but you are on a right track. Do not be surprised if we see him playing for India before the next World Cup. The talent is there, as is the potential. Add consistency, maintaining of fitness and good performances, a place in Team India certainly beckons.", "description": "Yashasvi Jaiswal became an overnight sensation in domestic cricket when he slammed 203 runs in 154 balls for Mumbai vs Jharkhand in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.
