O\u2019Donnell, one of Ramos\u2019s three public defenders, argued that prosecutors violated discovery rules by disclosing late in the proceedings several appraisals from mental health professionals that prosecutors hired. O\u2019Donnell said prosecutors filed five notices on Tuesday, the eve of jury selection, with four of those notices coming in at 10:45 p.m.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis late disclosure cannot stand,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said, asking Judge Laura S. Ripken to omit the testimony of the state\u2019s mental health experts as part of the alleged discovery violation.\n\nAssistant State\u2019s Attorney James Tuomey called the defense assertion \u201cthe most offensive allegation\u201d he\u2019s heard in his time practicing law. Tuomey and Anne Arundel County State\u2019s Attorney Anne Colt Leitess said the defense put itself in a bind by waiting until the last minute to provide prosecutors with information about experts testifying on Ramos\u2019s behalf. Prosecutors argued that they have been working around the clock to respond to defense court filings within appropriate deadlines and that the delay tactics feed into Ramos\u2019s desire to turn the court proceedings into a \u201cfarce.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe wanted this to be a circus,\u201d Tuomey said, citing a mental evaluation the state health department conducted of Ramos.\n\nAD\n\nRipken ruled in favor of prosecutors, denying the defense\u2019s request to bar prosecutors\u2019 mental health witnesses. Ripken said prosecutors have been responding in a timely manner to the defense and have been doing their due diligence.\n\nRamos on Monday admitted to killing five in the June 28, 2018, attack in the Annapolis-area newspaper offices: editorial page editor Gerald Fisch\u00adman, 61; assistant editor Rob Hiaasen, 59; sportswriter, reporter and editor John McNamara, 56; sales assistant Rebecca Smith, 34; and reporter Wendi Winters, 65. Six others in the office were not shot and escaped.\n\nAD\n\nProsecutors say the shooting was born out of a grudge Ramos had against the paper after it published a column about his guilty plea to harassing a former high school classmate and he lost a defamation suit against the publication.\n\nAD\n\nThough Ramos admitted to committing the offenses outlined in a 23-count indictment \u2014 including five counts of murder, and attempted murder, assault, and weapons charges \u2014 he has pleaded not criminally responsible. Ramos and his defense team have the burden of proving to a jury that Ramos \u201cbecause of a mental disorder, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct, and/or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d\n\nAfter Ripken\u2019s ruling Wednesday, a tense exchange followed between her and O\u2019Donnell, who asked that prosecutors be ordered to provide additional materials underlying the opinions of their mental health experts. Ripken said she would order prosecutors to comply with the rules of discovery. After some back and forth, the exchange ended with the judge calling for a recess and telling O\u2019Donnell, \u201cPlease don\u2019t roll your eyes at me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhen the proceedings continued, the defense asked for a postponement in the case, saying it needed time to digest the materials provided by prosecutors in light of Ripken\u2019s ruling.\n\nAD\n\nWilliam C. Davis, an attorney for Ramos, said the defense needed more time given the complexities of the case and to review a mental health report it was awaiting from a prosecution expert. \u201cHow are we able to rebut what we don\u2019t know yet?\u201d Davis asked, saying the defense is in an unfair position.\n\nLeitess fought against the postponement, suggesting that the defense\u2019s \u201ctrial tactics\u201d of waiting to the last minute to file notices and filings has backfired and that her office was ready for trial. \u201cThe defense is now frustrated because the state has been working around the clock\u201d to counter the defense\u2019s case.\n\nAD\n\nAnne Arundel County Circuit Court Judge Michael Wachs, in charge of hearing postponements, granted the delay.\n\nWachs said the defense is entitled for time to prepare to ensure a fair trial, noting that the deadlines for both sides to respond to and digest discovery material is \u201csimply not adequate for a case like this.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA new jury pool will likely have to be summoned for the new trial date. A spokeswoman for the judiciary said the jury pool summoned for the trial that was supposed to start Wednesday completed its service and members of the pool have been released.\n\nAD", "description": "The delay came on the day jury selection was set to begin in proceedings to determine if Ramos was so mentally ill during the assault that he should not be legally culpable.", "authors": ["Lynh Bui", "Reporter Focusing On Public Safety", "Criminal Justice"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nYmb-5xoubQs87SvVAkWR9k5y4E=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D3KHX4F22II6TDUDJZTIP2MYCQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
