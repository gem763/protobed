However, bullion\u2019s trade over the past five sessions puts it on pace to break out of a weekly skid of three consecutive weekly losses.\n\nGold for December delivery GCZ19, +0.10% on Comex was up 80 cents, or less than 0.1%, at $1,507 an ounce, after retreating 0.6% on Thursday. For the week, the yellow metal is on track for a 0.5% gain based on last Friday\u2019s closing price, which would halt three consecutive weekly declines, bringing the metal back above a psychologically significant level above $1,500.\n\nDecember silver SIZ19, -0.02% edged 2 cents, or 0.1%, lower to $17.865 an ounce, with the white metal on pace for a weekly gain of 1.8%.\n\nPrecious metals have benefited from the accommodative policy from the world\u2019s central banks, which has come amid signs of economic weakness in the U.S. and the rest of the world. Conflicts in the Middle East, with an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-processing complex, also has helped to bolster gold prices.\n\nSome evidence of more upbeat data in the U.S. on Thursday, however, helped to nudge down demand for haven assets, but investors will watch for comments from U.S. central bankers during Friday\u2019s session for further guidance on the outlook for monetary policy. On Wednesday, the Fed cut its target federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a 1.75%-2% range, as expected, but did not reveal a coordinated commitment to further accommodation.\n\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard on Friday explained in a statement on the regional central bank\u2019s website why he advocated for a more aggressive half percentage point cut to rates on Wednesday, citing a slowdown on the U.S. economy that was on the horizon and manufacturing that he described as already in recession.\n\nMeanwhile, New York Fed President John Williams was set to deliver a speech and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who voted to keep rates on hold, was slated to speak on Friday. Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida is expected to appear on CNBC at 10 a.m.\n\nMeanwhile, government bond yields were edging up along with futures for the main U.S. stock-market indexes, reflecting some tepid appetite for assets perceived as risky.\n\nStephen Innes, an independent strategist, said on Friday that gold may attract some buyers as investors attempt to brace for any surprise events, like the attack that played out last Saturday.\n\n\u201cAt this level of conflict, weekend headline risk needs to be respected, and a bit of gold coverage could put weekend risk matter to ease,\u201d Innes wrote.", "description": "Gold prices inch higher Friday but gains are capped by a rise in bonds yields and stocks.", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GH235_gold_ZG_20180412054329.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
