He said his coalition had scored \"an unquestionable triumph,\" and called on others parties to join him for a \"definitive triumph\" in the second round.\n\nSouth Korean-born evangelical pastor, Chi Hyun Chung, was in third place with 8.7 percent of the vote.\n\nIn a statement late on Sunday, Morales said he doubted a run-off would be necessary, saying rural votes would ensure an outright victory for him and his congressional allies.\n\nMorales, who will turn 60 next week, has been at the helm of the poor but resource-rich Latin American country for 13 years, and a new mandate would keep him in power until 2025.\n\nThe former coca farmer and leftist union leader obtained Constitutional Court permission in 2017 to run again for president even though the constitution allows only two consecutive terms.\n\nMorales, 59, came to prominence leading social protests and became Bolivia's first indigenous president in 2006.\n\nMesa is a 66-year-old historian who as vice president rose to Bolivia's top office when his predecessor resigned the presidency in 2003 amid widespread protests. Mesa, himself, was then forced to step aside in 2005 amid renewed demonstrations led by Morales, who was then leader of the coca growers union.\n\nVoting, which is mandatory, was mostly calm, although police said they arrested more than 100 people for violating the country's rigid election-day rules against drinking, large gatherings or casual driving.\n\nTerm-limit controversy\n\nTo avoid a December run-off and win outright in Bolivia, Morales needs to get 50 percent of the votes plus one or, with a 40 percent share finish 10 percentage points ahead of the nearest challenger.\n\nMorales' challenger Carlos Mesa briefly served as president between 2003 and 2005 [Juan Karita/AP]\n\nMorales voted early in the coca-growing region of El Chapare, where residents threw flower petals at him and he said he remained confident of his chances.\n\nIn his years in office, he allied himself with a leftist bloc of Latin American leaders and used revenues from the Andean country's natural gas and minerals to redistribute wealth among the masses and lift millions out of poverty in the region's poorest country.\n\nThe economy has grown by an annual average of about 4.5 percent, well above the regional average.\n\nMorales, the son of Aymara Indian shepherds, has also been credited for battling racial inequalities.\n\nBut Morales also has faced growing dissatisfaction even among his indigenous supporters.\n\nSome are frustrated by corruption scandals linked to his administration - although not Morales himself - and many by his refusal to accept a referendum on limiting presidential terms.\n\nWhile Bolivians voted to maintain term limits in 2016, the country's top court, which is seen by critics as friendly to the president, ruled that limits would violate Morales' political rights as a citizen.\n\n\"I'm thinking of a real change because I think that Evo Morales has done what he had to do and should leave by the front door,\" said Nicolas Choque, a car washer.\n\nBolivians were also electing all 166 congressional seats. Polls projected that no party would secure a majority in Congress, which could lead to an impasse for the upcoming administration.", "description": "Incumbent leader insists 'confident' of outright victory but partial results point to second round run-off in December.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/21/fe0891997360412eaae2bdb4881c955f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
