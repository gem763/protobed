Deutsche Bank would go on to become the lone financial institution in the 1990\u2019s willing to risk making huge loans to Donald Trump.\n\nEven as he condemns the Kurds for failing to do what they could not possibly have done at Normandy without a nation-state of their own, Trump says nothing about Deutsche Bank\u2019s Nazi past or about Turkey\u2019s continued sales of chromium ore to Germany until April 1944. Turkey finally returned to our side in August 1944\u2014two months after Normandy\u2014when it appeared that the Nazis were going to lose after all.\n\nU.S. forces that fought their way from Normandy into Germany recovered ledgers showing that Deutsche Bank had sold at least 998 kilograms of what the congressional report terms \u201cgold looted from individual victims of Nazi persecution.\u201d\n\nThe report adds, \u201cOther German gold acquired by Turkey during and after the War included coins and ingots from the account of German Foreign Minister Joachim Ribbentrop at the Reichsbank, which had been stocked with gold looted from occupied Europe.\u201d\n\nAt war\u2019s end, Turkey had done exactly nothing to assist the Allies besides no longer selling chromium to the Nazis. Turkey nonetheless argued that since it had been at war with Germany, it should not be expected to turn over whatever Nazi wealth it retained.\n\n\u201cTurkey, an 11th hour ally, returned no looted gold\u2026 and turned over no money,\u201d the report notes.\n\nTurkey also kept the money it made selling the Nazis chromium ore that kept the war going. The report says Turkey only stopped after President Franklin Roosevelt threatened Istanbul with \u201ceconomic war.\u201d\n\nOur current president made a similar threat this week, when he tweeted, \u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey.\u201d\n\nThe major difference is that this threat seems to be having no effect.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
