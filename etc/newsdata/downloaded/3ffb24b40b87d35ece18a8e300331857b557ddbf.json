REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado\n\nSANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile, grappling with violent protests that rocked the capital Santiago for days, will not let the riots derail plans to host two major global meetings in coming months, Foreign Minister Teodoro Ribera said on Thursday.\n\nHe said that there was \u201cno chance\u201d of calling off the Nov. 16-17 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit or the United Nations climate change conference COP25 in December.\n\nRiots that started over a hike in public transport costs prompted days of arson attacks and looting that led to the arrest of more than 6,000 people and at least 16 dead in one of the region\u2019s traditionally most stable and wealthy nations.\n\nVandals set fire to metro trains and stops, sowing $300 million in damage and hobbling public transportation. Chile\u2019s military has since taken over security in Santiago, a city of 6 million now under a \u201cstate of emergency,\u201d imposing curfews for five consecutive nights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certain that under no circumstances will this come to impact the conferences,\u201d Ribera told reporters.\n\nRibera said Chile\u2019s foreign ministry had contacted each of the 20 participants in the Asia-Pacific gathering of nations, known by its initials APEC.\n\n\u201cThey have expressed no doubt with respect to their attendance,\u201d he said.\n\nThe protests over inequality made APEC and the promotion of free and inclusive trade \u201cmore relevant,\u201d Ribera said.\n\n\u201cIf we want a more inclusive country, APEC is part of the solution.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump earlier in October said he would likely sign a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the summit, though U.S. officials more recently said the pact could be delayed.\n\nA diplomatic source in Santiago told Reuters the vice minister of trade had held a meeting with ambassadors from all the APEC nations to assure them that both conferences would proceed as planned.\n\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019m hearing in the corridors there may be some changes afoot to the APEC leaders week to make it more austere and cost less,\u201d the source said.\n\nA month ago, Chilean President Sebasti\u00e1n Pinera was praised in domestic media for his work at the G7 summit in France for acting as a go-between in a diplomatic spat involving French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over the Amazon forest fires.\n\nToday, walls and bridges around Santiago are scrawled with graffiti calling for Pinera\u2019s resignation after he became the first Chilean leader to bring troops onto the streets since the end of Augusto Pinochet\u2019s 1973-1990 dictatorship.\n\nJorge Heine, a former Chilean cabinet minister and ambassador to China, India and South Africa, said Pinera\u2019s stature in both conferences would be \u201cundoubtedly\u201d diminished.\n\nChile\u2019s strength had been its stable model of free trade around the Pacific, he said. \u201cNow Chile is not quite such the \u2018oasis in a troubled region\u2019 that Pinera claimed it was just a few weeks ago.\u201d\n\n\u2018WORKING AGAINST THE CLOCK\u2019\n\nChile took over the hosting of the COP25 conference in December after Brazil withdrew following the election of Bolsonaro, a climate skeptic.\n\nIn Cerrillos, at a former airforce base just southwest of central Santiago, workers continued to lay cement and pound nails at the conference site, unaffected by the nearby rioting.\n\nReuters spoke with several workers, neighbors, contractors and security guards at Cerrillos who said rioters had been thwarted by security forces amid the most heated weekend riots.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say 99% of construction workers have showed up to work,\u201d said Daniel Cruz, a Peruvian worker. But snarled public transportation had forced some to finish early, slowing progress six weeks before the Dec. 3-13 conference. \u201cWe\u2019re working against the clock.\u201d\n\nClaudio Moreno, of Chile\u2019s Carabineros police force, said the Cerrillos metro stop, which is expected to see heavy use during the event, had been unscathed.\n\n\u201cNo one got into the station, or into the COP installations,\u201d Moreno told Reuters.\n\nThe metro line that reaches the COP25 site was heavily damaged elsewhere, raising questions about connecting to downtown hotels, where many attendees will likely stay.\n\nA spokesman for the U.N. body mandated to organize the summit, the UNFCCC, said it had received \u201cassurances\u201d from the Chilean government. The governments of countries due to attend the two summits, including France, China, Brazil, Canada and Japan, told Reuters there would be no change to arrangements.\n\nMajor summits have previously been held in the wake of significant unrest - including the 2015 COP21 environmental summit in Paris. Weeks earlier 130 people were killed in a series of coordinated attacks claimed by Islamic State.\n\nFrench foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian dismissed a suggestion by far-left opposition lawmakers that the government suspend its participation in COP25 until the violence ends.\n\nAnd Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing expected \u201cChile\u2019s government will appropriately deal with the relevant problems\u201d and ensure the APEC summit passes in \u201ca safe and successful manner.\u201d", "description": "Chile, grappling with violent protests that rocked the capital Santiago for days, will not let the riots derail plans to host two major global meetings in coming months, Foreign Minister Teodoro Ribera said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Natalia A.
