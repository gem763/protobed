(AP Photo/Tyler Tate)\n\nNo. 14 Boise State fell from the ranks of the unbeaten late Saturday night in a 28-25 loss to BYU.\n\nThe Broncos entered Saturday\u2019s game as the highest-ranked team in a non-Power Five conference and the favorite to be the Group of Five team that makes a New Year\u2019s Six bowl game. That favorite status disappeared in Provo as the Bronco offense was stagnant without starting QB Hank Bachmeier.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBachmeier missed the game after he was injured in Week 7. He was replaced by Chase Cord who didn\u2019t get the Boise State offense consistently moving until it was too late in the fourth quarter.\n\nBYU ( 3-4) entered the game without its top two quarterbacks. Baylor Romney, a walk-on redshirt freshman, started for the Cougars after backup QB Jaren Hall was injured against South Florida a week ago. Hall made the first start of his career in Week 7 subbing for Zach Wilson after Wilson suffered a thumb injury.\n\nRomney was more productive than Cord. He threw for two third-quarter touchdowns to break the game open in BYU\u2019s favor. His first gave the Cougars a 21-10 lead when he found Matt Bushman for a 27-yard score. He hit Bushman again for a 39-yard TD and a 28-10 lead off a trick play just a couple minutes later after Cord threw his second interception of the game.\n\nBoise State pulled within three points with 3:17 remaining and things got weird on BYU\u2019s final possession. After taking a fair catch on the kickoff BYU got the ball on the 25, meaning it needed to get to its own 35 for a first down.\n\nThe ball was spotted just short of the 35 after third down and, inexplicably, the officials brought out the chains to measure the spot. And gave BYU a first down.\n\nStory continues\n\nUh, how did BYU get the ball at the 25 after a fair catch on a kickoff and get a first down short of the 35? pic.twitter.com/74t0xzt3zY \u2014 Yahoo Sports College Football (@YahooSportsCFB) October 20, 2019\n\nThe spot was ultimately reviewed and pushed back toward the 34. And BYU chose not to punt. Coach Kalani Sitake kept his offense on the field and Roman Kafentzis got a push and dove over the line of scrimmage for the game-clinching first down.\n\nWho\u2019s the Group of Five favorite?\n\nBoise State was just one of three undefeated teams outside the Power Five conferences entering Sunday. The Broncos\u2019 loss leaves SMU and Appalachian State as the only undefeated Group of Five teams.\n\nThe Mustangs will probably be the highest-ranked Group of Five team in Sunday\u2019s AP poll after a convincing win over Temple. SMU still has one-loss Memphis on the schedule in addition to Houston and Tulane. Appalachian State\u2019s conference schedule is much weaker though the Mountaineers have a non-conference game against South Carolina remaining. An undefeated App State with wins over both North Carolina and South Carolina could end up the highest-ranked Group of Five team at the end of the season if there are no other undefeated teams.\n\nBoise isn\u2019t out of it yet, either. With the AAC being one of the wildest conferences in college football so far \u2014 seven of 12 teams have two losses or fewer \u2014 there\u2019s a chance that a one-loss Mountain West champion could be the top non-Power Five team if Cincinnati doesn\u2019t end the season with its only loss being to Ohio State. And Boise State has a favorable schedule remaining with Utah State on Nov. 23 looming as the toughest game.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that Boise State\u2019s margin for error is gone. It\u2019s doubtful a two-loss Broncos team would be ranked higher than SMU, App State or any other champions from the other four non-power conferences. Boise needs to win out if it wants to get to a major bowl game for the first time since the 2014 season.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Broncos' loss to BYU leaves just two undefeated teams outside the Power Five conferences.", "authors": ["Nick Bromberg"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/39Ktb6Pjts7xDHRHzBznoA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTIuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zHVGpyC8q2O8Y50MpEQh.w--~B/aD0yMDAxO3c9MzAwNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/1c535ce0-f2f7-11e9-b2d5-0427083bd966", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
