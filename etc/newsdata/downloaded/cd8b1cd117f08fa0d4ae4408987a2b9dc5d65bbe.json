Did you hear me?\u201d Trump said, raising his voice and telling Mason not to be \u201crude.\u201d \u201cI have answered everything. It\u2019s a whole hoax and you know who\u2019s playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt was the coda to a foreign leader visit that began and ended with Trump\u2019s complaints on full display, starting with a sour venting session earlier in the day in the Oval Office.\n\nAs the targets of Trump\u2019s anger grow in number, Trump\u2019s public outbursts have also become more vitriolic.\n\nAD\n\nThe president described the whistleblower whose complaint alleges presidential abuse of power as \u201cfake\u201d and \u201cvicious\u201d and into \u201csome bad things.\u201d He accused the White House official who alerted the whistleblower about Trump\u2019s call of being a \u201cspy.\u201d He said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who is running the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, was guilty of \u201ctreason.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe blasted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) \u2014 who earlier Wednesday urged her caucus to be somber and prayerful during the impeachment process \u2014 saying she \u201chands out subpoenas like they\u2019re cookies.\u201d\n\nThe afternoon news conference began with a sense of normalcy that defied the sense of chaos enveloping Washington as Democrats ramp up their impeachment inquiry with document requests, subpoenas and congressional hearings.\n\nAD\n\nTrump, playing the role of statesman during his scripted opening remarks, offered condolences to Finland for a recent stabbing attack. He pledged to increase trade with the U.S. ally and encouraged Finnish companies to invest in the United States.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe want Finnish companies to join in America\u2019s extraordinary economic revival,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many countries are coming in. It\u2019s the hot place. We have the hottest economy in the world and it\u2019s the hot place to be.\u201d\n\nBut as the event turned to the unscripted question-and-answer session, Trump\u2019s other personas emerged. He presented himself as a victim, a survivor, a \u201cstable genius,\u201d a ruthless counterpuncher and the most productive president in history.\n\nNiinisto looked on, his face betraying his surprise and bewilderment at the dramatic arc of the Trump show. As Trump held court, the Finnish leader hardly got a word in. At one point, when Trump boasted of his wins before the World Trade Organization, Niinisto interjected: \u201cI think the question is for me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump grew most animated as he listed his grievances and described all the forces he believed are arrayed against him and his presidency.\n\nHe repeated words like \u201choax\u201d \u201cscam\u201d and \u201cfraud\u201d as casually as another president might say NATO or \u201cshared values.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the political storm, I\u2019ve lived with it from the day I got elected,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m used to it. For me, it\u2019s like putting on a suit in the morning.\u201d\n\nHe complained that after special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s extensive probe into Russian election meddling and potential obstruction of justice by the White House, he got only \u201cthree days of peace\u201d before the threat of impeachment cast a cloud over the second half of his term.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived with this cloud now for almost three years,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president lamented that former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) \u201cwould never give anybody a subpoena,\u201d hesitating when Trump\u2019s defenders wanted to use congressional powers to investigate Democrats and the FBI. By contrast, he said, Pelosi was a subpoena-approving machine.\n\nAD\n\nTrump also embraced a sense of victimhood-by-proxy for his aides, some of whom were implicated in Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\n\u201cThey came down to Washington to do a great job,\u201d he said of his aides, claiming that the investigations had \u201cdestroyed\u201d them. \u201cThey left Washington dark.\u201d\n\nBut Trump also presented himself as the battle-scarred victor who was uniquely capable of fighting back against his perceived enemies and on behalf of his supporters.\n\nAD\n\nIn describing how he has survived the \u201cgreatest hoax\u201d in history and a \u201cfraudulent crime on the American people,\u201d he cited conservative media figures.\n\n\u201cPeople have said to me, how does he handle it?\u201d Trump said. \u201cRush Limbaugh said, \u2018I don\u2019t know of any man in America that could handle it.\u2019 Sean Hannity said the same thing.\u201d\n\nHe suggested he was considering \u201cbringing a major lawsuit\u201d to respond to Mueller\u2019s investigation, a suit that presumably would pit the head of the executive branch against his own Justice Department.\n\nAD\n\nWhen a reporter asked Trump about a New York Times report that revealed contact between the whistleblower and Democratic staff on the House Intelligence Committee, Trump zeroed in on Schiff and accused him of orchestrating the entire episode.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt shows that Schiff is a fraud and I love that question,\u201d Trump said after taking a printed copy of the story from his suit jacket. \u201cThat\u2019s big stuff; that\u2019s a big story.\u201d\n\nNiinisto, who spoke for just a few minutes during the 40-minute news conference and 17-minute Oval Office meeting, talked about the greatness of U.S. democracy and encouraged Trump to \u201ckeep it going.\u201d He also offered a mild rebuke of Trump\u2019s constant berating of the European Union, which the president has said was formed to take advantage of the United States.\n\n\u201cI wanted to take up with the president the importance of trans-Atlantic cooperation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all know Europe needs U.S.A., but I say that U.S.A. needs also Europe. We know the price of everything. We should recognize also the value of everything.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump did not seem to mind or notice the light criticism, and he spent much of the news conference boasting about various aspects of his presidency, which he said was the most productive in U.S. history. He credited himself for cutting taxes and regulations, celebrated the \u201cbooming\u201d economy \u2014 even as the stock market fell nearly 500 points Wednesday \u2014 and celebrated veterans health-care legislation he signed.\n\nHe saved some of his most effusive praise for the controversial phone call he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a conversation that has become a central component of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment process.\n\nAt various points he described the call as \u201cbeautiful,\u201d \u201cperfect,\u201d \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201c100 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a thing wrong with it,\u201d he said of the call. \u201cBelieve it or not, I watch my words very carefully. There are those that think I\u2019m a very stable genius, okay?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhen Mason asked Niinisto about a recent World Trade Organization case in which the United States prevailed, Trump jumped in and claimed that his presence was what helped tip the judgment in his government\u2019s favor.\n\n\u201cYou never had wins with other presidents, did you?\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut we are having a lot of wins with WTO since I became president.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the case started long before Trump became president, and previous presidents also have presided over successful WTO cases.\n\nBut such minor details didn\u2019t stop Trump from engaging in his unique form of bragging.\n\n\u201cBecause I know that I\u2019m right and because I\u2019m doing a great job for the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very, very happy living the way I\u2019m living.\u201d", "description": "The combustible mix of the president\u2019s emotions has only become more potent as he faces the growing threat of impeachment.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BiyuE76z_KVKexFqyroUzh8vY50=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7JQED5XFNYI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg"}
