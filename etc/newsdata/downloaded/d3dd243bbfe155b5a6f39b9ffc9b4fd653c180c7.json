The game thereby kind of came down to which of these two factors would decide it, rather than either of them really kicking on or going up a level. Most of this match, after all, stayed at ground floor.\n\nIt was impossible to escape the feeling that this was a nadir, as illustrated by so many bad moments. Low quality characterised it, and those two major flaws predictably ended up cancelling each other out. It instead most seemed a competition for the worst moment, and you could pretty much take your pick.\n\nA stand-out, however, was a total blow-out. It was in the 33rd minute when Granit Xhaka stepped up for a free-kick within range of goal\u2026 and ballooned it out towards the corner flag. There had only been one shot on target by that point, from Andreas Pereira, and it was often as if the low standard was dragging down the application of even the better players.\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang was put through on goal in the first half only to kind of check his run and then play a ball towards Nicolas Pepe that seemed to have been delivered in slow motion. It was much the same when Marcus Rashford was played in by Paul Pogba, although he does have the reasonable excuse of recently returning from injury.\n\nAnd it was simply inevitable, then, that blatant errors were going to characterise both goals. The one Arsenal gave away was arguably worse, because of how systemic it was. They somehow conspired to gift United one of the few attacking situations they are comfortable in, which was a counter-attack \u2013 and from their own corner.\n\nEven then, Arsenal had seven players in their own box by the time the ball was worked to McTominay. Two seemed to duck, one got a touch, with that only helping the ball into the top corner. The finish, at the least, was a moment almost entirely out of synch with the rest of the game.\n\nThe equaliser wasn\u2019t. Harry Maguire displayed slowness of thought as well as feet in playing Aubameyang at least five yards onside, with the linesman somehow missing the big red body mere feet in front of him. The flag went up, but Aubameyang nicely clipped in for a goal that was belatedly given through VAR.\n\nThere did seem a hesitation from the United defenders, but then the briefing to every squad at the start of the season was to play to the whistle and conclusion of play. And that was pretty much the conclusion of play.\n\nYou could even find fault with the mistakes after that, as none of them were quite calamitous enough to give us late drama, or a decisive moment. Rashford did go close with a free-kick but\u2026 it wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nThe story of the game.
