If 30 000 had accepted the package, it would have meant a saving of R4.8 billion in 2019/20.\n\nBy 2022, R8 billion would have been saved.\n\nAs early as October last year, the minister had already raised concerns about wage agreements that were well above inflation.\n\n\u201cThe 2018 wage agreement for officials exceed the baseline budget figure by about R30.2 billion over the medium term.\n\n\u201cWe did not allocate additional funds for this. The national and provincial departments will have to absorb the costs within their salary budgets,\u201d Mboweni said.\n\nOn Friday, Treasury would only say that it would address this issue during the medium-term budget policy speech at the end of the month.\n\nRoodt does not expect Mboweni to come to the fore with more drastic plans immediately.\n\n\u201cNot yet. This is a thing that will be ironed out in time. But I think it will be a disappointment to Mboweni if so few officials did apply,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat else can government do to reduce the state wage bill?\n\nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword RETIREMENT and tell us what you think.
