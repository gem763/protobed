When a need for the saviour was felt, country needed an individual to lead the new revolution, and get Indian cricket out of the muddle.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe responsibility fell to Sourav Ganguly - the job was herculean and task at hand insurmountable. Taking over as the leader of the group that was in disarray and devoid of ideas, it warranted a radical change in fortunes.\n\nDon't Miss 217 SHARES 4.7 K SHARES 156 SHARES 555 SHARES 39.8 K SHARES\n\nBut Ganguly was not the one to be fazed, he took onus on himself, and shouldered the burden of responsibility to lead the resurgence. He would lead from the front as in next five years, Indian cricket team would go from a ruffled and disgraced unit to a competitive team.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Natwest Series win in 2002, World Cup finalists in 2003, 2-1 home series win against Australia in 2001, were some of the highlights of his reign.\n\nFast forward to 2019, Sourav Ganguly has another revolution to lead after being chosen as the president-elect of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The world's richest cricket board that is the BCCI, has been in the news for all the wrong reasons in last few years.\n\nThe board has always been cricticised for be bullish, notorious, and has suffered from corruption allegations. After the Indian Premier League betting scandal that came to light in 2015, Supreme Court appointed Lodha Committee to analyse and recommend implementable actions for improving the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).\n\nGetty Images\n\nIt was also given the task to suggest and assess the quantum of punishment for Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra in the Indian Premier League (IPL) betting scandal.\n\nBut BCCI being their usual self refused to heed to the recommendations of the committee, leading to the top court sacking then President Anurag Thakur.\n\nIn 2017, the Supreme Court nominated a four-member panel Committee of Administrators (Vinod Rai, Ramachandra Guha, Vikaram Limaye and Diana Edulji) to look after the administration of the BCCI in order to implement Lodha Committee reforms.\n\nThe board has been an utter mess, much like the state of Indian cricket in 2000 - Sourav Ganguly is in familiar territory, but administration is a different fish than leading on the field. He has the vast experience of the game, but he needs to be proactive in leading Indian cricket to new elevation.\n\nGetty Images\n\nGanguly told PTI after his name was unanimously decided upon, \u201cObviously, it\u2019s a great feeling as I have played for the country and captained the country.\"\n\n\u201cAnd I am taking over at a time when BCCI has not been in greatest of position for the last three years. Its image has got hampered quite a lot. It\u2019s a great opportunity for me to do something good,\u201d said the former India captain.\"\n\nHe is quite right in his assessment, BCCI is shambles and needs a new direction. Over the years, politicians have made the president's post their own, and done little to improve cricket at the grassroots. The money minting IPL has been predominantly pampered and domestic cricket has seen little investment.\n\nPTI\n\nIt is one aspect Ganguly has to drastically change and give the domestic cricket its due. The former Indian captain is himself familiar with the nous of Indian cricket, and will do well to bring the swagger to lower leagues.\n\nHe has been a cricketer, a leader and seen it all - he is a winner and knows what it take to reach the pinnacle. Our Dada has shown his mettle on the field, and there should be optimism that he will get it right.\n\nBCCI needs to be about cricket and cricket alone - Sourav Ganguly will provide just that.", "description": "When Indian cricket team was rattled by match fixing in 2000, everything went downhill and it was a crash that shook the cricket to its foundation.
