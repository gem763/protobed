This would make it bigger than British rival ITV (ITV.L).\n\nThe deal ends a bumpy, months-long race to find a buyer for the Netherlands-based Endemol Shine Group, which is co-owned by The Walt Disney Company (DIS.N) and private equity group Apollo Global Management, Inc. (APO.N).\n\nUpon completion of the acquisition, Banijay will own almost 200 production companies in 23 countries and territories. Besides the popular science fiction series \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d its combined catalogue is expected to include brands and formats such as \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d, \u201cBig Brother\u201d, \u201cMasterChef\u201d, \u201cSurvivor\u201d, \u201cTemptation Island\u201d and \u201cWife Swap\u201d.\n\nEndemol was put up for sale in July 2018 with a price tag of 2.5 billion euros-3 billion euros ($2.78 billion-$3.34 billion). It drew interest from several bidders at the time though the pool of suitors eventually shrank, with European broadcaster RTL Group (RRTL.DE) walking away in August 2018.\n\nThe acquisition will be financed through a Banijay capital increase and the refinancing of Banijay and Endemol\u2019s existing debt, supported by Deutsche Bank, Natixis and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n\nPost-closing, the combined group will be held by LDH (67.1%) and French media conglomerate Vivendi (VIV.PA) (32.9%).\n\nLDH is a holding company controlled by Financi\u00e8re LOV (52%), Banijay founder Stephane Courbit\u2019s investment arm. Other LDH shareholders are Italian group De Agostini with 36% of the capital, and Fimalac, the investment company of French investor Marc Ladreit de Lacharri\u00e8re, which will own 12% of the capital.", "description": "French media company Banijay said on Saturday it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the equity of Endemol Shine, the production house behind global television hits such as \"The Voice\" and \"Black Mirror\".", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
