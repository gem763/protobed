Then the New York Times article fails to mention that the man that is making the accusation, Max Stier, whom they only identify as a \"former classmate\" of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and a CEO of a non-profit, is a lawyer that worked for President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton during the Lewinsky investigation, of which, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was a member of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation into the Clinton administration. Oh, and the non-profit that Max Steir is CEO of, basically operates as an arm of the Democratic Party. But the biggest omission the New York Times made was to not inform the reader that the woman, at the center of this sexual assault accusation by Max Steir, doesn't recall any such incident ever occurring. This is a blatant hit piece by a once prestigious publication that now only peddles unsubstantiated accusations, conjecture, speculation, spite-based opinions, histrionics, hyperbole, half-truths, and outright lies, presented as fact based news, all to the benefit of the Democratic Party.", "description": "Felicity Huffman managed a smile as she and her husband William H.
