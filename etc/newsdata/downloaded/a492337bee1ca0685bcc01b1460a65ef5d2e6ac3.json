But protests led officials to withdraw it.\n\nThe fine also prompted an online appeal to raise money to pay it.\n\n\"I would like to integrate myself honestly in your society without asking for alms,\" he wrote on a cardboard sign, displayed nearby while he swept. \"I will keep your street clean and ask only a contribution for my work.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post, Matteo D'Angelo - who started the online appeal - said the migrant had swept up \"leaves that block the drains every time it rains, cigarette butts and all the rubbish that we civilised citizens throw on the ground.\n\n\"Woe betide a poor chap who tries to integrate himself,\" he added.\n\nMonday's actions reportedly drew police attention after complaints from residents.\n\nBut the fine was withdrawn after police received four phone calls from other local residents who defended him.\n\nAuthorities said the fine had been given by officers who were new and inexperienced.\n\nImmigration continues to be a controversial issue in Italy, where thousands of migrants have arrived in recent years.\n\nLast week, Italy and France called for a new system to automatically redistribute migrants across the European Union.", "description": "Officials scrap a penalty imposed on a Nigerian man who chose to sweep for money instead of begging.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11FB8/production/_108965637_gettyimages-172207050.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
