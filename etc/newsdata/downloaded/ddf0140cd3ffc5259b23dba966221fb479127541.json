That was before they released a statement from assistant GM Brandon Taubman hours before Game 1 of the World Series.\n\nMajor League Baseball also issued a statement Tuesday concerning the incident, saying it will interview those involved before commenting on the matter any further.\n\nThe statement from the league says in part: \"everyone in baseball must use care to not engage in any behaviour \u2014 whether intentional or not \u2014 that could be construed as minimizing the egregiousness of an act of domestic violence. We became aware of this incident through the Sports Illustrated article. The Astros have disputed Sports Illustrated's characterization of the incident.\"", "description": "The assistant general manager of the Houston Astros has issued a statement apologizing for using \"inappropriate language\" after a report in Sports Illustrated said he repeatedly yelled toward a group of female reporters during the team's celebration after clinching the AL pennant.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5330979.1571771213!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/angels-astros-baseball.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
