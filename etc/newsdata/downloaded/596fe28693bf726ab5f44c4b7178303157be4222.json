He said: \u201cI am afraid that the security people didn\u2019t want me to come along tonight because they said the road was full of uncooperative crusties and protesters of all kinds littering the road. And they said there was some risk that I would be egged.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion began a planned two-week shutdown of central London on Monday including many sites around parliament in protest against the lack of action to tackle the climate crisis. By 9.30pm 280 people had been arrested.\n\nThe book launch was held at the Royal United Services Institute on Whitehall, not far from climate demonstrators on Westminster Bridge and at Trafalgar Square.\n\nIn his remarks at the event, Johnson listed issues on which he claimed Thatcher was right, including her approach to \u201cbring about \u2026 the end of apartheid\u201d. According to an account of his comments briefed out by No 10 on Monday evening, he said: \u201cI hope that when we go out from this place tonight and we are waylaid by importunate nose-ringed climate change protesters we remind them that [Thatcher] was also right about greenhouse gases.\n\n\u201cAnd she took it seriously long before Greta Thunberg. And the best thing possible for the education of the denizens of the heaving hemp-smelling bivouacs that now litter Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park, the best thing would be for them to stop blocking the traffic and buy a copy of Charles\u2019s magnificent book so that they can learn about a true feminist, green and revolutionary who changed the world for the better.\u201d\n\nThunberg, who has played a leading role in a global movement seeking action on the climate crisis, was born in 2003; 13 years after Thatcher left office.\n\nJohnson, a former Daily Telegraph columnist, also paid tribute to Moore\u2019s \u201calmost obsessive lust for accuracy and detail that is the hallmark of all great Daily Telegraph journalists\u201d.\n\nMoore, referring to his time editing Johnson\u2019s work at the paper, recently told the Evening Standard: \u201cWell, it was a nightmare. Because of Boris always being so late \u2013 and I mean terribly late \u2013 with his copy. But, of course, he was a journalistic genius and had a great gift for seeing the nub of something and turning it into something exciting.\u201d\n\nJohnson joined the Telegraph after being fired from the Times having been accused of fabricating a quote from his own godfather.\n\nTimeline Boris Johnson - three decades of sackings and giving offence Show Hide\n\nFired by the Times after landing a job at the newspaper through his family connections.

Compared same-sex marriage to polygamy and bestiality in his debut book, Friends, Voters, Countrymen. \u201cIf gay marriage was OK \u2013 and I was uncertain on the issue \u2013 then I saw no reason in principle why a union should not be consecrated between three men, as well as two men, or indeed three men and a dog,\u201d said Johnson. Four years before, Johnson described gay men as \u201ctank-topped bumboys\u201d in his Telegraph column. Condemned for publishing an article as editor of the Spectator in which Liverpool fans were blamed for the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. While the article says the event was \u201cundeniably\u201d a tragedy, it added: \u201cThat is no excuse for Liverpool\u2019s failure to acknowledge, even to this day, the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon.\u201d It also claimed that people in Liverpool \u201cwallow\u201d in their \u201cvictim status\u201d.

Caught on camera reciting a colonial-era poem by Rudyard Kipling in front of local dignitaries while on an official trip to Myanmar. Johnson, who was accused of \u201cincredible insensitivity\u201d, had been inside the sacred Buddhist site the Shwedagon Pagoda when he began murmuring the first verse of Mandalay, a later verse of which includes the line: \u201cBloomin\u2019 idol made o\u2019 mud, wot they called the Great Gawd Budd\u201d. Criticised for making incorrect statement that the jailed British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been \u201cteaching people journalism\u201d rather than being on holiday in Iran.
