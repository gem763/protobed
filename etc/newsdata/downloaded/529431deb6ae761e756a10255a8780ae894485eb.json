He has other plans:\n\nI am running as an Independent candidate for Mayor of London, and here\u2019s why.

The only thing I am launching next week is my 4 year old\u2019s model boat. \u2014 Rory Stewart (@RoryStewartUK) September 29, 2019\n\nThe former cabinet minister made an outsider run for the party leadership against Johnson earlier this year that ultimately fell well short of success, as Breitbart News reported.\n\nThe Eton graduate and former Labour member is on the record saying the only Brexit deal he would attempt to deliver would be the one laid out in Mrs May\u2019s thrice-rejected withdrawal treaty with the bloc, and that he would not back a clean break if this could not be delivered.\n\nBefore embracing politics, Stewart combined military service with diplomacy.\n\nHe told the New Yorker magazine in 2010 how Prince Charles once asked him to tutor his sons William and Harry.\n\nHe developed \u201cThe Lawrence of Arabia\u201d moniker from a book he wrote about his walk across Afghanistan \u201cwith only a toothless mastiff for company\u201d in 2002.\n\nThe experience was recounted in a 2004 book The Places In Between.\n\nHe was appointed a deputy governor in southern Iraq after the US-led 2003 invasion and had previously served as Britain\u2019s representative in Montenegro after the 1999 Kosovo war.\n\nAll this has led to speculation that Stewart \u2014 like his father \u2014 was a member of the MI6 foreign intelligence service. He denies it.\n\nIn government, he was a minister for international development and Africa, and also prisons.", "description": "Defeated\u00a0Conservative Party leadership candidate Rory Stewart has said he will be standing down at the next general election.", "authors": ["Simon Kent"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/rory-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
