I was around 18 at the time. Epstein, Andy, approximately eight other young girls, and I had sex together.\n\n\u201cThe other girls all seemed and appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn\u2019t really speak English. Epstein laughed about the fact they couldn\u2019t really communicate, saying that they are the \u201ceasiest\u201d girls to get along with.\u201d\n\nA judge in a civil case threw out Ms Roberts' evidence as impertinent and immaterial in May 2015.\n\nThe latest claims are bound to cause further embarassment for the Duke of York, who has repeatedly denied having sex with Ms Andrews and has said he never saw the disgraced financier do anything illegal during their friendship.\n\nEpstein\u2019s housekeeper in Palm Beach would later claim that Prince Andrew visited the mansion at least 3 or 4 times \u2013 during which time he would receive massages from the girls staying there.\n\nMr Fisten has claimed in a lengthy interview with Dispatches being broadcast on Monday evening that it would have been impossible for Epstein\u2019s friends and acquaintances to spend any amount of time around him without having their suspicions aroused as to his behaviour towards young women.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen people tell me, I didn\u2019t know what Jeffrey was about, I don\u2019t want to say BS. I\u2019ll just say hogwash. Because if you were around Jeffrey you were around underage girls. He has no children. He has no nieces\u2026 Come on. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that something was going on there.\u201d\n\nThe private investigator says he was shocked by what he came across during his enquiries.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk to these girls \u2026 your hearts had to pour out to them because they were so vulnerable,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSome girls would tell me that they would have to wear the same outfit to school every single day, and then wash it in the sink. They just barely had enough food to eat\u2026 This is the type he looked for, the younger the better, the more in need, the better for him.\u201d\n\nMs Maxwell\u2019s lawyers did not respond to the latest claims. She previously denied any wrongdoing.\n\nBuckingham Palace repeated denials issued earlier this year, stating: \u201cAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.\u201d and \u201cIt is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew said: \u201cAt no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.\u201d", "description": "Investigators looking at the activities of convicted sex-offendor Jeffrey Epstein discovered an address book containing more than a dozen telephone numbers for his friend the Duke of York, it is being claimed.", "authors": ["Patrick Sawer", "Senior News Reporter", "Juliet Samuel", "Ruth Dudley Edwards", "Janet Daley", "Rob Wilson"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000206113106-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq0PK6rQM6QMm_uQOSzVPjFiUg9kBm7f0xN1vDe3WAKAk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
