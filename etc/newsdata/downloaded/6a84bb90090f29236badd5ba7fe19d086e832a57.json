Everyone has got carried away with the short term but in the long term there is a lot more to come.\n\n'I am delighted for him. He will feel good about that and he should do.'", "description": "Christian Pulisic is confident he will rediscover his 'scoring touch' after an influential cameo performance against Newcastle.
