REUTERS/Susana Vera\n\nSome protesters vandalized shops and police made several arrests but in most cases the protests were peaceful. The young protesters, many wearing face masks, were often supported by Sunday shoppers out for lunch.\n\nIn one incident, a group of 50 shoppers inside a mall, none wearing masks, faced off against riot police outside the mall doors, chanting \u201cHong Kong police mafia\u201d. The shoppers cheered and clapped when police drove off.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s police, once praised as \u201cAsia\u2019s finest\u201d, have been accused of using excessive force in dealing with protesters and have lost the confidence and respect of many Hong Kongers.\n\n\u201cPolice officers have used minimum necessary force to disperse protesters, including the deployment of tear gas. We warn the rioters to stop their illegal acts immediately,\u201d police said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nHong Kong has been battered by four months of often massive and violent protests against what is seen as Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on the Chinese-ruled city, and more protests are planned for Sunday.\n\nThe protests started in opposition to a now-abandoned extradition bill but have widened into a pro-democracy movement and an outlet for anger at social inequality in the city, which boasts some of the world\u2019s most expensive real estate.\n\nThe unrest has plunged the city into its worst crisis since Britain handed it back to China in 1997 and poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\n\u2018POLICE STATE\u2019\n\n\u201cHong Kong used to be a prosperous city and now she has become a police state. Hong Kong is my home. We should protect her. We should resist,\u201d said a 70-year-old who only gave his last name, Hui.\n\nHe was part of a group of 60- to 70-year-olds on Nathan Road, Kowloon, cheering the protesters, urging them to block the road and warning them when police were returning.\n\nRiot police entered some malls and metro stations and marched down roads in a show of force as protesters erected makeshift road barriers. Police made several arrests, chasing down individual protesters in the street.\n\n\u201cI think the police have been using their power to suppress the citizens. That\u2019s why more and more young children come out and protest against the government and the police. Those being arrested don\u2019t have human rights. This is not fair,\u201d said resident Mary Lam, 26.\n\nPetrol bombs were thrown inside a Hong Kong metro rail station on Saturday but no one was injured, the government said.\n\nProtesters scaled the city\u2019s Lion Rock peak and hoisted a large statue they called \u201cLady Liberty\u201d early on Sunday to rally anti-government activists ahead of more planned demonstrations in the Asian financial hub.\n\nThe three-meter (9-feet) statue, wearing a gas mask, helmet and protective goggles, was carried up the 500-metre (1,500-feet) peak in the dead of night by several dozen protesters, some wearing head lamps, during an overnight thunderstorm.\n\nIt held a black banner that read \u201cRevolution of our time, Liberate Hong Kong\u201d and could be seen from the city below.\n\nThe statue represented an injured woman protester believed by activists to have been shot in the eye by a police projectile. One of the protesters told Reuters he hoped it would inspire Hong Kong people to keep fighting.\n\n\u201cWe are telling people that you mustn\u2019t give up. All problems can be resolved with Hong Kong people\u2019s persistence and hard work to reach our aims,\u201d he said.\n\nCRISIS\n\nProtesters have targeted Chinese banks and shops with links to mainland China. A group wielding hammers damaged a Huawei store on Sunday.\n\nDemonstrators believe China has been eroding Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms, guaranteed under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula introduced with the 1997 handover.\n\nThe now-withdrawn extradition bill, under which residents would have been sent to Communist-controlled mainland courts, was seen as the latest move to tighten control.\n\nChina denies the accusation and says foreign countries, including Britain and the United States, are fomenting unrest.\n\nThe Hong Kong government introduced colonial-era emergency laws last week to ban the wearing of face masks at public rallies, a move that sparked some of the worst violence since the unrest started in June.\n\nSlideshow (17 Images)\n\nPolice have arrested more than 2,300 people since June. Since September, nearly 40% were under the age of 18 and 10% under 15.\n\nProtesters accuse police of using excessive force, claims which they deny. Two protesters have been shot and wounded during skirmishes with police.\n\nHong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade due to the protests, with tourism and retail hardest hit.", "description": "Hong Kong pro-democracy activists staged a cat-and-mouse game with riot police on Sunday, mounting protests in several shopping malls and chanting slogans such as \"Free Hong Kong\" until police arrived and then dispersing among weekend shoppers.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440321238&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C09A", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
