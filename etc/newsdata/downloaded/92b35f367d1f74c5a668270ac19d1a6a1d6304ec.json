However, the student, Jacob Pope, doesn't understand why honoring the anthem has garnered so much attention.\n\nJacob, a 17-year-old junior at South Davidson High School in Denton, N.C., was on his way to football practice when he heard the anthem being played before the high school girls' softball game on Friday. Instead of continuing on his way to practice, he stopped in his tracks in an empty parking lot to honor the anthem.\n\nThe moment was captured by a retired teacher\u2019s assistant, Angie Gallimore, who was attending her grandchildren\u2019s tennis match and softball game at the school.\n\n\u201cI just happened to look over to the parking lot \u2014 there was no one else out there, and there he stood,\u201d Gallimore tells Yahoo Lifestyle, adding that Jacob was too far away for her to initially identify. \u201cHis helmet was off and his hand was over his heart. I just thought that was amazing.\u201d\n\nJacob was unaware that anyone was witnessing his act of patriotism.\n\nGallimore, with Jacob's mother's permission, shared the photo on Facebook.\n\n\"So proud of this South Davidson student,\" Gallimore wrote. \"There is still hope for this world.\"\n\nGallimore, who is still a substitute teacher at Davidson County Schools, had Jacob as a student when he was in middle school.\n\n\u201cAny time anybody was disrespectful, he would call them out on it,\u201d Gallimore tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cHe was an upstanding student.\u201d\n\nWhen Gallimore realized who the student was, she reached out to Lauren Pope, Jacob\u2019s mother. The photo left Lauren feeling \u201cproud and blessed,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nAlmost immediately, the Facebook post received hundreds of shares.\n\n\"That boy is being raised right!\" one person wrote.\n\n\"I'm sure his parents are proud. They raised an awesome son,\" another shared.\n\n\"We will be fine if our future is in the hands of kids with that kind of integrity,\" one commented.\n\nThe comments have left Lauren and her husband, Chad, humbled.\n\n\u201cYou always worry and wonder, \u2018Are you doing the right thing? Are you raising them right? Are they going to turn out to be good, functioning adults?\u2019\u201d Lauren tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cHe did this when no one was looking. He could have just as easily walked home and no one would have known the difference. He did the right thing, regardless of being alone or in a crowded room.\u201d\n\nStopping to pay his respect as the national anthem plays is something that Jacob always does, Lauren tells Yahoo Lifestyle, and it stems from the pride he has in his grandfather, who served as military police in Vietnam.\n\n\u201cThe anthem has a special meaning for Jacob,\u201d Lauren says. \u201cAnd for the nation.\u201d\n\nJacob, however, is surprised by all of the attention.\n\n\u201cHe is absolutely shell-shocked,\u201d Lauren says. \u201cHe\u2019s just like, \u2018Mama, I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s such a big deal to do the right thing. I was just doing the right thing. That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "As the national anthem played in the distance, a high school football player on his way to practice stopped in his tracks and placed his hand on his heart.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UgepxuprxsfX8FAvRcz0kg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/wghp_north_carolina_424/99b0bdfc0562ef0fe735ed19f9d4b201"}
