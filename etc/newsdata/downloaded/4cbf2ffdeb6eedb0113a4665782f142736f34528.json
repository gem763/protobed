The tweet was posted by a journalist Turkey accuses of having links to a network led by a cleric who is blamed for a 2016 failed coup attempt. Turkish media reports say the journalist, Ergun Babahan, is wanted in Turkey.\n\nThe tweet drew ire from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s ruling party and as well as Bahceli\u2019s party - which are allies. Turkey\u2019s main opposition party also said it regarded the embassy\u2019s move as an insult to Turkey\u2019s parliament.\n\nThe embassy issued a second apology after Hovenier was called to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.\n\n\u201cWe do not associate ourselves with Ergun Babahan nor do we endorse or agree with the content of his tweet,\u201d the embassy\u2019s second apology read. \u201cWe reiterate our regret for this error.\u201d\n\nThe incident occurred at a time when ties between Turkey and the U.S. are strained over Syria policies. Turkey is accusing Washington of not acting fast enough toward the creation of a so-called safe zone in northeast Syria that would keep U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters away from the Turkish-Syrian. Disagreements remain on the size of the zone.\n\nErdogan has threatened a unilateral intervention to drive away the Kurdish fighters.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Turkey summoned a top American diplomat Sunday after the U.S. Embassy's official Twitter account \"liked\" a tweet that said the people of Turkey should prepare for a political era without the leader of Turkey's national party, who is reportedly ill.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/10/17/turkey_saudi_arabia_missing_writer_00633_c0-448-4756-3220_s1770x1032.jpg?efeacf4c2733ae91732efe363835e688769c948b", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
