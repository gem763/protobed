It showed no fear as he edged towards it, firing off several photographs. The creature was apparently unfazed by the presence of a human. Either it was comfortable being around humans, or felt unthreatened because of its status as the apex predator in this habitat.\n\n\u201cThis was 23 years ago, and I didn\u2019t have much technical knowledge then,\u201d says Yagi. \u201cBut I thought, \u2018This must be a wolf\u2019.\u201d\n\nYagi, a keen mountaineer, spends a lot of time in the mountains around Chichibu in central Japan, but this was the first time he had come face to face with an animal he had spent the best part of his life searching for.\n\n\u201cI decided I would try and give him an osenbei (a rice cracker) and put out my hand and offered it to him,\u201d says Yagi. \u201cI am right-handed, so I offered the cracker to him in my left, thinking that even if he bit my left arm, I would be alright.\n\n\u201cHe was right in front of me at this point. I had brought the rice cracker right under his mouth. But he didn\u2019t take it. He just stood there. I tried to see if he smelled like a wild animal, but he didn\u2019t. He had no smell. And just like a new-born baby, he had no knowledge or fear of danger.\u201d\n\nYou might also like:\n\nWolves have been extinct in Japan for at least 100 years, according to scientific records.
