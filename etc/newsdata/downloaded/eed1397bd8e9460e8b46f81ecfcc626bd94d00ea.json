I understand that these will affect the consumers. Great. And just how much will tariffs cost consumers? \"By how much? About $460 over a year for the average family, according to an analysis\n\nfrom the economists Kirill Borusyak at University College London and Xavier Jaravel\n\nand at the London School of Economics.\" That's $38 a month. The equivalent of 4 drinks at a bar or 9 Starbucks coffees. I'd say the average family can handle it. In exchange, we start buying more American products, and bring pressure to bear on China with whom we already have an unfair trading relationship. Doesn't look like there's much to see here, move along folks.\n\nThis assumes that one can buy comparable products in America. We have been buying China so long that we do not have the manufacturing capacity currently to produce, for example, children's shoes in anywhere near the quantities needed.\n\nThe problem with tariffs is they are not law so how big they are and how long they last is up to our leader, and when we get a new leader (perhaps in 17 months) things may radically change. Companies know this, so they will be very slow to start producing products at a much higher cost than those currently coming from China.\n\nWhile a lot of cowboys out there seem to think this is a great idea to put China in its place, the laws of unintended consequences could well come into play here. With a president for life, China can withstand a lot more pain than Americans are willing to.", "description": "https://thehill.com/policy/finance/459487-five-things-to-know-about-trumps-labor-day-weekend-tariffs Another source.
