To be on X Factor, it was a privilege, it was an honour. I\u2019m here with X Factor tonight.\"\n\nMany of Brendan's co-stars were at the Mirror's awards last night, as well as judges Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh.\n\nLouis chatted about the contest, telling us Martin Bashir has no chance of winning.\n\nThe judge, who oversees the ITV talent show with Simon and Nicole Scherzinger, says journalist Martin isn't a very good singer.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHe told us: \"I'm loving X Factor, I'm having the most fun. I love the idea and I love the celebrities.\n\n\"It was tough on Saturday with [Olivia Olson] going.\n\n\"Everyone is so good, nobody's bad ... Martin Bashir's not great but he knows that.\n\n\"He had a great story and he's a great raconteur, he's just not a great singer.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nLouis added that he still has no idea who is taking part in the All Stars version of the show, which will hit screens after the Celebrity version is finished.\n\nAlthough Louis has previously told Mirror Online that Shayne Ward, Leona Lewis and Alexandra Burke are on the line up.\n\n* The Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB, will broadcast on ITV on 5th November at 8pm\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
