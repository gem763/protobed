I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nMr Trump initially proposed closing the entire 2,000 mile southern border but in a two-hour meeting in the Oval Office proposed far more extreme measures.\n\nMr Trump had already publicly suggested that US soldiers could open fire on migrants approaching America if they threw rocks. When his staff told him that was illegal, Mr Trump suggested in the March meeting that they could instead shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down.\n\nAlthough Mr Trump eventually was talked out of his most radical ideas, he also reportedly fired key immigration officials who pushed back against his suggestions.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Mr Trump shouted at many of his aides during the meeting, telling them: \"You are making me look like an idiot\". \"I ran on this. It\u2019s my issue,\u201d he stressed.\n\nThe president reportedly grew frustrated with his immigration officials Credit: AFP More\n\nAmong those who reportedly attempted to dissuade the president was Kirstjen Nielsen, his then homeland security secretary, who told him the measures would not achieve his desired aim.\n\nThe paper reported Ms Nielsen also attempted to explain to Mr Trump the need for new powers to take down drones, to which he responded: \u201cKirstjen, you didn\u2019t hear me the first time, honey... Shoot \u2019em down. Sweetheart, just shoot \u2019em out of the sky, OK?\u201d\n\nMs Nielsen was later ousted from her post in a purge of senior immigration officials including her deputy Claire Grady and the head of US citizenship and immigration services Frank Cissna.\n\nAll were replaced with hardliners who have since announced the administration would allow immigrant families to be detained indefinitely and deny green cards for certain immigrants.\n\nMr Trump has dismissed the claims in the report, tweeting on Wednesday: \"Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border.
