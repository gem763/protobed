Gunners always stand up.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArsenal remain in fifth place in the table, two points adrift of Chelsea, and manager Unai Emery admits he has plenty to work on ahead of home fixtures against Crystal Palace and Wolves who took five points off the Gunners at the Emirates last season.\n\n\u2018Really, my point of view tonight is that there are things to analyse and improve,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Defensively at the beginning of the match they pushed and we didn\u2019t stop them. We didn\u2019t concede a lot of chances, but they had corners offensively and they can score from these corners.\n\n\u2018We had more than them, but we know they are a strong team in that situation and they use it to win matches. In other situations throughout the 90 minutes I think we controlled it in moments to create more chants.\n\n\u2018We didn\u2019t score tonight, but if we played another match like tonight, I think it\u2019s more easy to achieve the points.\u2019\n\nMORE: Arsenal legend Ian Wright criticises Unai Emery for dropping Dani Ceballos against Sheffield United\n\nMORE: Unai Emery issues challenge to Nicolas Pepe after Arsenal star missed sitter vs Sheffield United", "description": "Dani Ceballos has vowed to fight until the end for a place in the Premier League's top four after Monday's disappointing defeat against Sheffield United.
