We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko said Friday that he was not aware of \u201cany possible violation of Ukrainian law by (Joe) Biden and by (Hunter Biden).\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly, without evidence, claimed that Biden as vice president threatened to withhold \u201cbillions of dollars to Ukraine\u201d unless it removed prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the oligarch behind Burisma Group. Hunter had served on Burisma's board of directors.\n\nLutsenko, who closed the investigation into the gas company in 2017, made the comments during an interview on NBC that echoed what he told the Washington Post the day before about Hunter Biden, that \u201cfrom the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything.\u201d\n\nThe comments from Lutsenko came on the same day Reuters reported the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine said an investigation into Burisma covered the years 2010 through 2012, before Hunter Biden joined the energy company's board. The younger Biden joined in 2014.\n\n\u201cHunter Biden cannot be responsible for violations of the management of Burisma that took place two years before his arrival,\u201d Lutsenko told the Post.\n\nTrump is facing an impeachment inquiry that was sparked by allegations from a in whistleblower complaint that Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint says Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani was a \"central figure in this effort,\" and in a summary of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky released Wednesday, Giuliani is mentioned by both leaders.\n\nLutsenko told NBC that he had been in contact with Giuliani and had \u201cspoken with him maybe 10 times.\u201d\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci, David Jackson, Nicholas Wu, Michael Collins\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/27/ukrainian-prosecutor-says-joe-biden-hunter-biden-did-not-violate-laws/3789411002/", "description": "Former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko also said that he had been in spoken with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani\u00a0\"maybe 10 times.\u201d", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
