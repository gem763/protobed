And if they are, it\u2019s in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nWhile Joe Biden still maintains a strong lead among African American voters, polling steady at around 40 percent, Warren\u2019s increased efforts on the campaign trail to reach black voters have helped. Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, told Politico that the gradual broadening of Warren\u2019s base has played a significant role in her rise.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re African-American, Warren may not have been someone you knew very well,\u201d Murray said. \u201cYou knew Joe Biden, sure, but now you\u2019re paying more attention.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s next challenge is performing well in South Carolina, the fourth state on the primary trail, where more than 60 percent of primary voters are African American. While a recent CNN poll put her at only 4 percent of the black vote in South Carolina, compared to Biden\u2019s 45, Warren has not dedicated significant time and resources to the state; she is ranked 12th overall among the Democratic pool in attending South Carolina events, with only 13 public appearances so far, per the Charleston Post and Courier.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Elizabeth Warren\u2019s polling numbers continue to surge among African Americans, an important demographic in the race for the Democratic nomination, according to the most recent Morning Consult poll released on Wednesday.The poll indicated Warren is up by five points among black voters since August, a shift", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BVC3sooTa.wyYMN1WcuuVQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://i2.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/elizabeth-warren-campaign-5.jpg?fit=1024%2C597&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
