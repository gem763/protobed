GDR-era architecture and infrastructure is still strewn across the former east (including tourist-friendly districts Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg and Friedrichshain), from the streetlights and high-rise Plattenbauten tower blocks to outsize boulevards, such as Karl-Marx-Strasse, and the former Geisterbahnh\u00f6fe \u2013 the metro network \u201cghost stations\u201d that were closed during the period of division.\n\nThen there are the demographic divisions. There\u2019s a reason the biggest Turkish communities \u2013 and the best kebabs \u2013 can be found in former West Berlin districts, such as Neuk\u00f6lln, Kreuzberg and Wedding, while former eastern districts, like Lichtenberg and Marzahn, are known for their Vietnamese communities and restaurants. It is because Gastarbeiter (guest worker) programmes of the 1950s-70s saw West Germany draft in workers from Turkey (among other countries), while the Gastarbeiter (the GDR equivalent) were from communist countries allied to the Soviet Union, such as Vietnam.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Part of the East Side gallery: murals and art painted on a 1.3km stretch of the remnants of the Berlin Wall. Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer\n\nEvery five years there is an anniversary to mark the fall of the Wall, though with every passing year the cold-war era of the divided city gets further away. This year is a particular milestone, as on next week\u2019s 30th anniversary (9 November) the Wall will have been down longer than the 28 years it stood. Between 4-11 November, the city will host more than 200 events to \u201ccelebrate and remember\u201d, including films and documentaries, photo exhibitions and concerts (including an appearance from Patti Smith), art installations and talks \u2013 taking place at Wall-related spots, such as the Brandenburg Gate, Alexanderplatz, and the East Side Gallery.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alexanderplatz, television tower and the Berlin skyline. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nFor those visiting outside these celebrations there are plenty of relevant sights to see, from the well known East Side Gallery, official Mauermuseum and Checkpoint Charlie, to more off-the-beaten-path, poignant locations listed below. For those with a deeper interest, walking or cycling the entire (or at least part of) 160km Mauerweg (Berlin Wall Trail), which follows its route and is studded with memorials, stories and outdoor exhibitions, is highly recommended.\n\nMuseumswohnung (Museum Apartment)\n\nThis tiny apartment in the former East Berlin neighbourhood of Hellersdorf has five rooms (living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, study) that have been preserved since GDR times, complete with furnishings (television, hi-fi), knick-knacks (books, vinyl records, typewriter), and even cleaning and kitchen products.\n\n\u2022 Free, Hellersdorfer Strasse 179, stadtundland.de. Open Sundays 2pm-4pm, by appoitment on +49 (0)151-16114447\n\nBaumhaus an der Mauer (Treehouse at the Wall)\n\nMost visitors wander past this ramshackle summer house and garden without realising its historic significance. Built by the late Osman Kalin, a Turkish migrant living in West Berlin, it was initially founded on a piece of wasteland that officially belonged to East Germany but was accessible from the West due to the GDR not walling it off properly. Kalin cleared and cultivated the area, growing vegetables and flowers right in the shade of the Wall. Despite pressure from both sides, the project has survived and is now run by his son.\n\n\u2022 Bethaniendamm 23, close to Saint Michael church\n\nG\u00fcnter Litfin Memorial\n\nThis former GDR watchtower is at the end of a cul-de-sac on Kieler Strasse, next to the Berlin-Spandau ship canal and a cemetery. Surrounded by modern apartment buildings on three sides, today it serves as a memorial to G\u00fcnter Litfin, who was shot dead close to here while attempting to swim across the canal just 11 days after the Wall went up in 1961. The memorial was inaugurated by G\u00fcnter\u2019s brother J\u00fcrgen, who renovated the long-abandoned tower, and who maintains it to this day. Guided tours are available via the website below.\n\n\u2022 Kieler Strasse 2, gedenkstaette-guenter-litfin.de.

Photograph: Adam Eastland/Alamy\n\nOne of the last prestigious urban building projects of the GDR, this park was inaugurated in 1986 to commemorate former communist party leader Ernst Th\u00e4lmann\u2019s 100th birthday. A monumental bust of Th\u00e4lmann looms at its western edge (on Griefswalder Strasse). Spanning 25 gloriously ungentrified hectares in highly gentrified Prenzlauer Berg, it is home to high-rise apartments, a swimming pool and youth theatre, plus a planetarium that was cutting-edge for its time and is still in use today.\n\n\u2022 Prenzlauer Berg\n\nFormer border crossing at Chausseestrasse\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty Images\n\nThis former checkpoint was the only place where German citizens could enter the GDR by car and is notable mostly for its Total petrol station and a small adjacent park. Look closely, though, and there are tram tracks in the middle of the road, which were rendered defunct when the GDR\u2019s \u201cghost stations\u201d were reopened. There are also engravings of rabbits on the pavements, created by artist Karla Sachse, a reference to how rabbits were the only creatures that could come and go freely across the Wall without fear of being shot.\n\n\u2022 Intersection of Chausseestrasse and Liesenstrasse\n\nParlament der B\u00e4ume (Parliament of Trees)\n\nNext to the Marie-Elisabeth-L\u00fcders-Haus, in the centre of the Government Quarter where the border wall once ran, this piece of land was claimed by artist and activist Ben Wagin in 1990. It is used to campaign against all aspects of war and restrictions on personal freedoms and contains an ensemble of memorial stones, graffiti-splattered sections of the Wall and a makeshift exhibition of photos and texts. Wagin can sometimes be found tending to the garden and chatting with visitors.\n\n\u2022 Adele-Schreiber-Krieger-Strasse, visitberlin.de\n\nPaul Sullivan is a Berlin-based guidebook writer, tour guide and founder of slowtravelberlin.com\n\nLooking for a holiday with a difference?
