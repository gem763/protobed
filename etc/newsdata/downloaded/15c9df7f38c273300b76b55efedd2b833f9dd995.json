There is still a risk of the US falling into recession next year,\" said Tracey McNaughton, head of asset allocation at Wilsons Advisory.\n\nA sharp fall in short-dated bonds can indicate that investors are expecting interest rates to drop more urgently than they had previously expected. Bonds rallied, with the yield on the Australian 10-year government bond falling to 0.92 per cent, from 0.96 per cent. The US 10-year bond yield traded at 1.5820 per cent.\n\nTraders have seized on the chance of easing when the Federal Reserve meets on October 29-30, with the probability of a cut now priced at 74 per cent compared to 41 per cent on Monday, according to NAB.\n\nAustralia's cash rate was lowered by one quarter of a percentage point to 0.75 per cent on Tuesday, a fresh record low. Economists participating in The Australian Financial Review's September quarter survey are expecting the cash rate to fall to 0.5 per cent by mid-2020.\n\nBut according to the futures market, the terminal rate is around 0.4 per cent, implying a possible cut to 0.25 per cent next year.\n\nFurther policy measures could be deployed by the Reserve Bank if rate cuts fail to achieve inflation and employment targets, economists agree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBanks are struggling to contain the damage from low interest rates to their net interest margins and have declined to pass on all of the Reserve Bank's cash rate cut to customers inciting sharp political criticism.\n\nHyperion's Mr Arnold, who does not own any banks in his Australian equity fund, is negative on the sector expecting the subdued level of credit growth will make it difficult for lenders to grow earnings.\n\n\"There is also lots of pressure on fees. There is the potential at some stage in the future for bad and doubtful debts to move up,\" he said.\n\nWith the return of aggressive selling in global sharemarkets this week, Ms McNaughton said the market moves \"are exactly what you would expect from a market that is on assisted living\".\n\n\"Risk premiums have been artificially suppressed by central bank liquidity,\" she said, referring to efforts from global central banks to prop up economies with unconventional policy measures.\n\n'OK until it's not'\n\nMarkets have relegated fundamental drivers to the back seat, she said, adding \"that's OK until it's not\". As the ISM survey reminded investors, the economic underpinnings of the market still matter, Ms McNaughton said.\n\nAndrew Ticehurst, fixed income strategist at Nomura Securities, takes a more pessimistic view on the outlook for the global and local economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Tapped-out consumers and a downturn in construction is holding back momentum from monetary easing and a lower Australian dollar,\" he said. \"It's a battle between these forces but it's playing out in sub-trend growth.\"\n\nFor Greg Bundy, chairman at Federation Asset Management, central bank support will win out for markets. He attributes this week's losses to investors looking for an excuse to sell, as US markets trade near lofty levels. The S &P 500 hit a record closing high of 3025 on July 26 this year.\n\n\"I think that we could see a few more days of selling,\" the fund manager said, but he's not expecting a lasting downturn.\n\nBen Griffiths, portfolio manager at Eley Griffiths, agreed: \"Any sell-off in equities will likely be brief,\" he said.\n\nThat's due to the \"positives of stimulus being applied right now either via lower rates, expansive fiscal policy, growth in M2 money supply and a gradual improvement in financial conditions,\" the fund manager said.\n\n\"Investors have had to contend with extraordinary levels of noise in recent months,\" he acknowledged. \"They are rightly shaken right now but need to hold their nerve.\"", "description": "Weak US economic data dialled up the global panic, while heightened expectations of rate cuts sent the short-end of the Aussie bond market to record lows.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/965e3e0a7d54e061786138dd2e995869a5f568c7", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
