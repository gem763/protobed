You Bet!", "language": "en", "text": "We hear protests about \u201cclass warfare\u201d and warnings not to try to \u201csoak the rich.\u201d But as Warren Buffett has observed: \u201cThere\u2019s class warfare, all right. But it\u2019s my class, the rich class, that\u2019s making war, and we\u2019re winning.\u201d\n\nThe infuriating data on tax rates, reported a few days ago by my colleague David Leonhardt, come from a new book, \u201cThe Triumph of Injustice,\u201d by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. The class warfare against struggling Americans has unfolded in many dimensions aside from tax policy \u2014 factory closings and lack of job retraining, corporate greed and irresponsibility, assaults on labor unions, stingy social welfare, mass incarceration and so on \u2014 and we\u2019ve seen the results in rising \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d from drugs, alcohol and suicide. America\u2019s richest men now live almost 15 years longer than the poorest men \u2014 roughly the same gap in life expectancy as exists between the U.S. and Nigeria.\n\nAs a society, instead of playing Robin Hood to smooth out the inequities, we\u2019ve played the Sheriff of Nottingham. Lawrence Summers, the economist and former Treasury secretary, has calculated that if we had the same income distribution today as we had in 1979, the bottom 80 percent would have about an extra $1 trillion each year and the top 1 percent would have about $1 trillion less.\n\nInstead, each household at the top has averaged an annual bonus of more than $700,000 a year.\n\nOne of the most consequential political debates in the coming years will be whether to raise taxes on the wealthy. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has suggested returning to a 70 percent marginal income tax rate, and both Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have proposed taxes on wealth in addition to income.\n\nTwo M.I.T. economists, Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo, demolish the traditional arguments against higher taxes on the wealthy in an incisive book coming out next month, \u201cGood Economics for Hard Times.\u201d While major league sports teams have salary caps that limit athletes\u2019 pay, Banerjee and Duflo note that no one argues \u201cthat players would play harder if only they were paid a little (or a lot) more. Everybody agrees that the drive to be best is sufficient.\u201d", "description": "And they\u2019ll still be loaded.", "authors": ["Nicholas Kristof"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/opinion/13Kristof2/13Kristof2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
