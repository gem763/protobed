In 1992, the paleo-conservative Pat Buchanan ran against George HW Bush before the president lost the White House to Bill Clinton. But no sitting president has been denied his party\u2019s nomination since Chester A Arthur in 1884.\n\nThe current challengers do not stand much chance of upsetting or even minorly damaging Trump. He has treated them with his usual disdain, exaggerating his (admittedly very high) popularity among Republicans, coining a customary nickname \u2013 \u201cThe Three Stooges\u201d \u2013 and homing in on his challengers\u2019 weaknesses.\n\nWhile governor of South Carolina, Sanford famously said he was absent from the state because he was hiking the Appalachian trail. In fact he was in Argentina, conducting an extra-marital affair.\n\nWalsh, who won office in the Tea Party wave of 2010 but lost it in 2012, has apologised for voicing racist opinions about Barack Obama.\n\nWeld, a relatively liberal Republican, was governor of Massachusetts between 1991 and 1997, has never held national office and was running mate to the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, in 2016, winning a little more than 3% of the popular vote.\n\nWho won the Democrats' debate? Our panelists' verdict Read more\n\nNonetheless, the three men press on.\n\nIn March, Weld told the Guardian: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, George HW Bush\u2019s numbers were at 91% in December 1991, and look what happened to him.\u201d\n\nFor the Post, he, Walsh and Sanford wrote: \u201cUnder this president, the meaning of truth has been challenged as never before. Under this president, the federal deficit has topped the $1tn mark.\n\n\u201cDo we as Republicans accept all this as inevitable? Are we to leave it to the Democrats to make the case for principles and values that, a few years ago, every Republican would have agreed formed the foundations of our party?\u201d\n\nThey concluded: \u201cIn the United States, citizens choose their leaders. The primary nomination process is the only opportunity for Republicans to have a voice in deciding who will represent our party. Let those voices be heard.\u201d", "description": "Mark Sanford, Joe Walsh and Bill Weld write for Washington Post after four states cancel nominating contests to give Trump clear run", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b37a9c2d95b8ed52ea969af56be42a7468dc13d/0_117_3465_2079/master/3465.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c4cc0c4f90fe8c2d7b82e7bed4df9a2d", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
