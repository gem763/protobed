We are very clear on that,\" added Southgate.\n\n\"We want the players to be able to concentrate on football, they want to be judged on football.\n\n\"What I've got to do is provide a secure, safe environment for them to play.\"\n\nRaheem Sterling was also the subject of racial abuse when England beat Bulgaria 4-0 at Wembley last month.\n\nThe Manchester City forward has been an outspoken campaigner on the need to do more to eradicate racism from the game.\n\nHowever, Sterling said he still has \"full faith\" in UEFA's handling of racist incidents.\n\n\"As a player, with the situation that happened in Montenegro, I don't think as a team we were quite prepared and knowing there was a protocol in place,\" said Sterling.\n\n\"As a team, we had a meeting and Gareth sat us down and explained there was a UEFA protocol.\n\n\"Now as players we have got to kind of give UEFA a chance to take that responsibility on board and deal with that situation.\n\n\"At this moment in time, full faith in UEFA.\"\n\nThe game will be England's first visit to Bulgaria since September 2011, when Ashley Young was subject to monkey chants as the visitors won 3-0.\n\nThe BFU was fined by UEFA for \"discriminatory\" chanting and because fans threw fireworks.\n\nBulgaria were also punished by UEFA for \"racist behaviour\" when they lost away to the Czech Republic on June 7 and at home to Kosovo three days later in Euro qualifying.\n\nFor the England visit, UEFA has ordered the BFU to close at least 5,000 seats at the Vasil Levski National Stadium and display a banner that reads: \"#EqualGame\".", "description": "England will follow UEFA protocols if any of their players experience racist chanting during upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers, according to manager Gareth Southgate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9362/4dff28b40af04f6cb24341e0cd96a247.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
