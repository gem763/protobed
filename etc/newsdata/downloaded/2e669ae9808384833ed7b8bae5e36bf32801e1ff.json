We were seeing a little bit of a pick up around our results ... but that seems to have softened off again,\" Gilvary said.", "description": "BP expects oil demand to grow by less than one million bpd in 2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF831C9_L.jpg"}
