I know him as a man of integrity and dedication to our country,\u201d Volker said during his testimony.\n\nVolker also testified that he told Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiTrump holds call with House GOP amid impeachment inquiry Democrats claim new momentum from intelligence watchdog testimony Overnight Defense: House Dems subpoena White House for Ukraine documents | Pence pulled into inquiry | GOP senator says he confronted Trump over Ukraine aid | Iran hackers target 2020 campaign MORE that accusations against the former vice president and 2020 Democratic candidate were \u201cnot credible.\u201d\n\nAt a July 19 breakfast with Giuliani, Volker said, he told Trump\u2019s lawyer \u201cthat it is not credible to me that former Vice President Biden would have been influenced in any way by financial or personal motives in carrying out his duties as vice president.\u201d\n\nVolker testified for several hours before three House committees behind closed doors on Thursday as part of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, which centers on Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky.\n\nAccording to his prepared remarks, Volker told lawmakers that he reached out to Giuliani to connect him with leaders in Ukraine in an effort to change Giuliani\u2019s negative view about Ukraine, which he explained had spread to Trump.\n\nTrump, Volker said, was skeptical of Ukraine\u2019s leadership and at one point told him Ukraine \u201ctried to take me down.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President was very skeptical. Given Ukraine\u2019s history of corruption, that is understandable. He said that Ukraine was a corrupt country, full of \u2018terrible people.\u2019 He said they \u2018tried to take me down,\u2019 \u201d Volker said in opening remarks.\n\n\u201cIn the course of that conversation, he referenced conversations with Mayor Giuliani. It was clear to me that despite the positive news and recommendations being conveyed by this official delegation about the new president, President Trump had a deeply rooted negative view on Ukraine rooted in the past,\u201d Volker said.\n\nDemocrats have seized on text messages furnished by Volker as further evidence Trump was pressuring Ukraine to pursue politically motivated investigations.\n\nThe messages showed Trump administration officials indicating to Ukraine that a meeting between Trump and Zelensky would be contingent on Ukraine launching investigations into 2016 election interference and Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company with which Biden\u2019s son Hunter was involved.\n\nIn one exchange, William Taylor, a top U.S. embassy official in Kiev, raises concerns about military aid being withheld from Ukraine unless that country helped with political investigations.\n\nVolker acknowledged discussions with Ukraine\u2019s leadership about the country making a statement about investigating \u201cBurisma and 2016\u201d in the broader context of corruption, but separated the issue of Burisma from the Bidens. Volker also said he encouraged Ukraine to avoid public statements \u201cthat could be seen as interfering in 2020 elections.\u201d\n\nIn one key text message exchange released by Democratic lawmakers, Volker indicated to top Ukrainian aide Andriy Yermak that a Ukrainian visit to the White House would be contingent on investigations.\n\n\u201cHeard from White House\u2014assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,\u201d Volker wrote to Yermak on the morning of July 25, just before Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky.\n\nVolker also told the committee in his opening statement he became aware of a hold placed on U.S. security assistance to Ukraine during the time he was in contact with Giuliani and Yermak, but that he \u201cdid not perceive these issues to be linked in any way.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has alleged without evidence that Biden pushed for the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to the benefit of Burisma, which once employed his son; Giuliani admitted in a recent CNN interview that he asked Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s efforts, as well as Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, formed the basis for an intelligence community whistleblower complaint alleging Trump was using his official position to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election. The complaint, a redacted version of which was released last week, has triggered formal impeachment proceedings in the House.\n\nTrump has dismissed accusations he pressured Ukraine to investigate a political rival, saying it wasn\u2019t about politics but that he is concerned about investigating \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\n\"I\u2019m only interested in corruption. I don\u2019t care about politics. I don\u2019t care about Biden\u2019s politics,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. \"I never thought Biden was going to win, to be honest.\"\n\nBrett Samuels and Saagar Enjeti contributed.", "description": "Kurt Volker, the former State Department special envoy to Ukraine, testified to Congress that he was not involved in or aware of any effort to press Ukraine to investigate allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden, according to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/newsletter-biden_092519getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
