Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nNancy Pelosi has a plan to score Americans cheap drugs.\n\nOn Thursday, the House speaker unveiled her party\u2019s proposal for curbing the skyrocketing costs of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States by, among other things, enabling the federal government to negotiate the price that Medicare will pay for up to 250 name-brand drugs. Under the terms of the legislation, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would have some discretion over exactly how hard a bargain to drive. But the bill would bar the government from paying any more for a covered drug than 120 percent of the average price at which said pharmaceutical retails in other industrialized countries (specifically, the maximum would be set at 120 percent of the volume-weighted average price in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.K.).\n\nNotably, while America\u2019s seniors would be the primary beneficiaries of the legislation, Pelosi\u2019s plan would also lower costs for younger Americans on private insurance: Although the bill would not technically require drug companies to offer the government-negotiated prices to private insurers, firms that refused to do so would face stiff and steadily rising penalties. Specifically, if a company declined to offer Aetna the same deal as Uncle Sam on a given drug, it would have to pay the federal government a fine equal to 65 percent of its gross sales of that drug from the previous year. If the company persisted in its intransigence, the percentage on that fine would increase by 10 percent every three months until it hit a maximum of 95 percent.\n\nThe plan would also establish a $2,000 out-of-pocket maximum for Medicare beneficiaries, penalize drug companies that raise the price of their wares faster than inflation, and reinvest the money Medicare saves through negotiation into research for new treatments at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nAlthough still less far-reaching than progressives would prefer, Pelosi\u2019s bill represents a partial concession to her caucus\u2019s left flank. An earlier version of the legislation would have made the independent Government Accountability Office the final arbiter of a drug\u2019s price, a provision that would have limited the government\u2019s leverage in negotiations.\n\nUnlike the bulk of the House Democrats\u2019 legislative proposals this year, the prescription-drug package is not purely a messaging device. Due the breadth and intensity of public outrage over soaring pharmaceutical prices, along with the popularity of \u201cbig government\u201d action for driving down drug costs, some Republican senators have embraced a more modest package of reforms. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has mulled a variety of more radical actions. For these reasons, it\u2019s not inconceivable that some version of Pelosi\u2019s bill could make it into law.\n\nThat said, the legislation is designed to serve a clear political purpose: heightening the contradictions between the GOP\u2019s base and its economic orthodoxy. On Thursday, 24 House Republicans decried Pelosi for \u201cpushing a socialist proposal to appease her most extreme members.\u201d But in this case, what\u2019s good for Pelosi\u2019s \u201cmost extreme members\u201d is also good for the typical Republican voter. Recent polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests 86 percent of Americans want the government to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. And for the GOP\u2019s increasingly elderly coalition, the issue of drug prices is especially salient.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, by tying the maximum price to an index of what consumers pay for drugs abroad, Pelosi\u2019s bill aims to spotlight the tensions between Trumpian nationalism and corporate conservatism.\n\nTraditionally, conservative economists have had a go-to rebuttal to progressive complaints about the aberrantly high cost of prescription drugs in the U.S.: If Americans paid European-level drug prices, pharmaceutical companies would lack the resources and incentives necessary for sustaining research and development into new cures.\n\nCenter-right economists would concede that the status-quo arrangement was unfair. Americans should not have to shoulder the burden of propping up Big Pharma\u2019s R&D while the residents of other OECD countries get a free ride off the resulting innovation. Nevertheless, it was in America\u2019s enlightened self-interest to sacrifice on behalf of the global good, even if other countries took advantage of our largesse. As future Trump White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett wrote in 2004, \u201cThe U.S. market has been large enough relative to the rest of the world that it has been able to support research despite [Europe\u2019s] intrusions\u201d into prices \u2014 but \u201cthere could be devastating effects should our policy environment change.\u201d\n\nThis argument hasn\u2019t aged well (and not merely because the case for using monopoly patents to finance drug research is substantively weak). Few nuggets of conservative conventional wisdom are more at odds with Trumpism than \u201cif Europe won\u2019t pay its fair share for drugs, American seniors should pick up the slack.\u201d\n\nAnd this point hasn\u2019t been lost on Trump himself. Earlier this year, the president contemplated signing an executive order that \u201cwould tie some drug prices to those set by European governments, an idea that is tantamount to price controls and opposed by members of his own party,\u201d according to the New York Times. Pelosi has effectively signaled that her party will stand with Trump on this issue even if his own allies won\u2019t.\n\nAs of this writing, the White House has yet to take a clear stance on the bill. Where it comes down will say a lot about how the Trump administration balances the president\u2019s political interests against the financial ones of major GOP donors. For the president, signing popular bipartisan legislation that makes good on one of his 2016 campaign promises \u2014 and delivers a clear and significant benefit to a core Republican voting bloc \u2014 should be a no-brainer. There is only an electoral upside to such a move. Trump doesn\u2019t need Big Pharma\u2019s money, and anyway, what\u2019s the drug industry going to do, start funding the party of single-payer? The only thing that could stop Trump from getting onboard is his conservative advisers\u2019 mindless ideological opposition to interference with the \u201cfree market\u201d (which, in this case, is defined as \u201cgovernment-granted patent monopolies\u201d).\n\nRegardless, Pelosi\u2019s bill should secure Democrats a victory of some kind. The question is whether it\u2019ll be a substantive or political one: Either Democrats save American consumers a bunch of money, or they\u2019ll gain their 2020 nominee a potent wedge issue.\n\nFor the GOP, actually doing something to help its nonaffluent constituents may be the tougher pill to swallow.", "description": "On Thursday, Nancy Pelosi unveiled her party\u2019s plan for curbing the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs in the U.S. by, among other things, enabling the government to negotiate the price that Medicare will pay for up to 250 name-brand drugs.", "authors": ["Eric Levitz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/19/19-nancy-pelosi-drug-prices.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
