With Ben Youngs expected to get the nod at scrum-half, the half-backs will replicate the partnership Lancaster selected.\n\nWhen the pressure came on in that World Cup opener, Lancaster turned to Farrell to lead the charge, with the then 23-year-old fly-half sending Mike Brown over for the crucial score that killed the game. Eight days later, Lancaster reinstalled Farrell to the starting line-up, but against Wales came the beginning of the end.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe irony is not lost in that England\u2019s campaign will once again begin against Pacific Island opposition, though England fans will hope that the difference in Tonga will not be the only difference this time around. England struggled to a 35-11 victory on that night at Twickenham four years ago, though it took two tries in the final eight minutes to awake home fans from their slumber and seal their first win of a campaign that would end two weeks later after losses to Wales and Australia.\n\nThese were the circumstances that brought Jones to England to try and restore the nation\u2019s rugby union credentials, though four years on the similarities are remarkable. Sunday\u2019s back line could see not just Youngs and Ford start in the same formation as they did under Lancaster, but also Jonny May and Anthony Watson, who look set to take spots on the wing. Even Jonathan Joseph could rekindle his role at outside centre, meaning five of the seven backs on display could be from the Lancaster era. In the pack, Joe Marler, Dan Cole and Courtney Lawes all started that Fiji game.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

England vs Tonga predicted team 1/24 England vs Tonga Who should Eddie Jones select in his opening squad for the Rugby World Cup? Reuters 2/24 1. Joe Marler With Vunipola absent, Jones would be wise to go with experience and Marler\u2019s XX caps bring just that. The Harlequins prop looked to have no chance of featuring at the World Cup when he retired last season, but could end up being the first name on the teamsheet in the opening match of the campaign. REUTERS 3/24 2. Jamie George The expectation is that Jones will go fully loaded for the opening game and then look to rest his best players where possible, given it will give them just under two weeks to prepare for their Argentina test. George is certainly one of those, and with two other hookers in the squad in Luke Cowan-Dickie and Jack Singleton, Jones can afford to give George a good hit-out before standing him down for the week. Getty Images 4/24 3. Kyle Sinckler This selection doesn\u2019t seem to be too much of an issue, given that Kyle Sinckler will bring form, power and pace to the pack if selected against Tonga while Dan Cole has a vast amount of experience at World Cups to deal with the job at hand. However, given the physicality of the Pacific Islanders, it might be sensible to deploy Sinckler first to give Tonga a few problems of their own. Getty Images 5/24 4. Maro Itoje Now we start to get to the tricky positions. If Mark Wilson fails to get through full training as he manages a knee injury, then he cannot realistically be considered for the opening fixture. That could then leave England in a bit of a whole, and as a result, we\u2019re selecting Itoje to play just 40 minutes. Jones could then send on Courtney Lawes for the second 40, with both slated to start against the USA. EPA 6/24 5. George Kruis Joining Itoje in the second row is his Saracens colleague George Kruis. The lock has enjoyed a wonderful return to form over the last year and his lineout expertise could prove a handy tool against Tonga, whose set-piece could prove a weakness. Getty Images 7/24 6. Tom Curry The absence of Wilson, if he fails to recover, leaves Jones with a tricky situation. He could start the inexperienced Lewis Ludlam on the blindside, deploy Courtney Lawes there, or choose to go with his double-openside tactic of Tom Curry and Sam Underhill. It\u2019s the latter that we\u2019re going for, as Curry fills the No 6 shirt having impressed in the World Cup warm-up games. EPA 8/24 7. Sam Underhill Underhill takes the No 7 shirt to provide England with that double-edge at the breakdown. If England can disrupt Tongan possession and slow them down at the ruck, it negates a lot of their best qualities. Both Curry and Underhill would then be stood down for the second match, allowing Lawes to start at 6 and Ludlam to start on the openside. EPA 9/24 8. Billy Vunipola It looks guaranteed that Vunipola will start against the country of his heritage with Wilson struggling, and as Jones has said over the last few weeks, the best way to get him at his best is to get the No 8 playing minutes. That could potentially see Vunipola double up and face the USA too, but it\u2019s hoped that Wilson will be back in time to start. EPA 10/24 9. Ben Youngs Youngs remains the first-choice scrum-half for now and should get the nod to start the campaign unless Willi Heinz has done enough in training to oust him from the shirt. REUTERS 11/24 10. George Ford England are keen to stay away from the brutality that will be thrown their way from the Tonga defence, and as such it looks like George Ford will start alongside Owen Farrell to ensure the ball is moved around to the outside backs. Ford impressed in playing every game of the warm-up series, and deserves to start the opening match on merit alone. REUTERS 12/24 11. Jonny May Just wind him up and let him go. May\u2019s in the form of his life, and will start in Japan as their first-choice wing. Getty Images 13/24 12. Owen Farrell Farrell captains the team from the No 12 shirt \u2013 which he returned to for the record victory over Ireland last month \u2013 in order to add that creativity to the midfield. Farrell is big enough to bring the physicality needed in an inside centre, but it\u2019s the ability to move the ball outside him that will be the most important quality needed. Action Images via Reuters 14/24 13. Manu Tuilagi It seems the smartest thing to do in selecting Tuilagi to fight power with power against Tonga, and then wrap him up in cotton wool for the Argentina game. With Henry Slade short on minutes after a knee injury ruled him out of the warm-up games, and Jonathan Joseph down the pecking order, Tuilagi could cause havoc in the opening game \u2013 but he is needed for much later in the tournament and a 50-minute hit-out before giving Slade minutes looks the best option. Getty Images 15/24 14. Anthony Watson This is where the back-line selection gets tricky. With Nowell injured, England will have to reply on Elliot Daly and Anthony Watson looking after the No 15 shirt. However, Joe Cokanasiga is another who has struggled with a knee injury this week, and you wouldn\u2019t want to expose Ruaridh McConnochie to the Tongans in his first fully competitive international Test. As a result, Watson will be needed to start on the wing. Action Images via Reuters 16/24 15. Elliot Daly Daly could be another player forced to double-up, as you would rather push the new Saracens addition to go back-to-back rather than Watson, given the latter\u2019s recent injury problems. Daly has proven he has that in him before, having played back-to-back between on the Lions tour ahead of the first Test, and with Nowell returning later in the tournament, Daly could be rested in one of the latter pool games. PA 17/24 16. Luke Cowan-Dickie Seems to be the natural understudy to George given that Jack Singleton is yet to play any minutes at hooker. Action Images via Reuters 18/24 17. Ellis Genge Could play a pivotal role in this World Cup off the bench as he did against Italy, with his injection of power likely to sap the energy reserves of the Tongan pack.

Joe Launchbury The Wasps lock will cover the second row, but with one eye on him starting against the USA, his minutes should be limited. AFP/Getty Images 21/24 20. Courtney Lawes Can come on for Itoje at half-time or soon after in order to allow both to go again on Thursday. Getty Images 22/24 21. Willi Heinz Provides cover for Youngs but should get enough minutes under his belt to push his claims for a starting spot later in the tournament to keep Youngs on his toes. Getty Images 23/24 22. Henry Slade Provides cover for fly-half if the worst happens to Ford and Farrell, but more use as a replacement for Tuilagi and an early introduction would be useful to give him minutes. Getty Images 24/24 23. Joe Cokanasiga/Ruaridh McConnochie If fit, Cokanasiga takes the final place on the bench as he can bring a second-half impact on the wing and Watson can cover full-back should anything happen to Daly. However, his fitness is under a big question mark, and should he fail to recover from the knee injury he\u2019s been struggling with, McConnochie will get the nod.

Getty Images\n\nThe question then is what have they learned from that experience?\n\n\u201cI think it helped us at the time to improve quickly,\u201d said Farrell of the 2015 nightmare. \u201cI think we did that and I think it gave us some good experience. But I feel like it is a long time ago now and, in-house, we are not really comparing anything we are doing now to back then. Obviously everybody else will do outside of here. But I think we feel like we are in a good place and we are excited about getting going.\n\n\u201cIt's been four years and hopefully there will be a lot of change - whether that is as players or people. I don't think anyone is the same as they were four years ago. Hopefully most have changed for the better.\u201d\n\nLancaster did stress before \u2013 and after \u2013 the tournament that the team he ended up picking was one suited to 2019 and not 2015, but the embarrassment of a home World Cup failure proved too much for the RFU and for Lancaster himself.\n\n\u201cIt feels like we've improved,: reflected Farrell four years on. \u201cI'm hoping we'll approve after this tournament as well and after the next one. We've got a few more caps than in the last one, a bit more experience.\n\n\u201cBut more than that the group feels in a good space. I'm not saying that we didn't after the last one, most people would tell you that we did. But we'd hope that we've come on.\u201d\n\nWhere once Chris Robshaw stood, now it will be Farrell as he captains his first World Cup campaign. The Saracens stand-off has taken the reins from Dylan Hartley, who remains absent with a long-term knee injury, and he has seen his captaincy questioned at times over the last 15 months since he was appointed co-captain.\n\nFirst came the way England unravelled against South Africa last summer, then came the scrutiny on his own tackling technique in the 2018 autumn internationals. But perhaps the biggest scrutiny arrived when England went from a winning position against Wales in Cardiff to a losing one, and then more so when they let a 37-0 lead over Scotland descend into a lucky 38-38 draw in which Ford scored a last-play equalising try.\n\nSince then, Farrell has spoken with past England captains considered greats of the game in Will Carling and Martin Johnson, the former through his role with the Rugby Football Union as a mentor and the latter during an in-training meeting during the summer.\n\nFarrell was able to bounce anything he wanted off the experience pair, but it is no surprise to hear that there is not a simple answer to the simple question: what makes a good captain?\n\n\u201cNo real secrets to it,\u201d said Farrell on the advice he received. \u201cNo magic potion to get it, it\u2019s all about doing your job, everybody, and being in the best place to do that and bring the best out of ourselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massive honour but the most important thing is the team, the team doing well and us preparing as well as we possibly can to perform in this tournament.\n\n\u201cWe lean on everyone in different ways. Everybody has a massive role to play while they\u2019re here. It\u2019s important that all the 31 pull in the right direction, all the 31 care massively about the team doing well. I think we\u2019ve got a great group of lads for that. Some will speak more than others, of course, but there will be others who put a smile on people\u2019s faces and others who get stuff organised. Every little thing that you\u2019ll do over the course of this tournament is to bring everybody else in the same direction.\u201d\n\nEngland players meanwhile have been told to turn off their phones an hour before kick-off in Japan in order to avoid any illegal approaches over match-fixing and betting, with the repercussions on the shocking investigation surrounding Rob Howley being felt ahead of the World Cup.\n\nHowley is being investigated by the Welsh Rugby Union after being accused of breaching World Rugby regulation 6, specifically in relation to betting on rugby, which is banned for all players, coaches, backroom staff and many other positions involved within the sport.\n\nWith the rugby world reeling from the news, England\u2019s scrum coach Neil Hatley revealed on Wednesday that he was all the more surprised by the news given that they had been subjected to two integrity briefings surrounding the matter, though one came in the wake of the Howley allegations.\n\n\"All the stipulations were set out very, very clearly,\u201d Hatley said. \u201cI know it gets done at the clubs and the Rugby Players' Association are actively involved in it so there is real clarity around it.\n\n\"I was a little bit surprised but it's all very clear, it's made clear before we arrived and it was made clear two days ago. It's a real [warning] for everyone at the tournament. A real live reminder.\"", "description": "Four years on from England\u2019s darkest hour in rugby union, Eddie Jones is set to return to the same trio of players to start their bid to win the Rugby World Cup as who Stuart Lancaster put his faith in.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/18/14/owen-farrell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
