REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Files\n\nThe steelmaker proposed to close its loss-making Orb Electrical Steels site in South Wales, potentially affecting up to 380 jobs, as it was \u201cunable to find a way forward\u201d for the business, it said in a filing to Indian stock exchanges.\n\nTata put up five of its non-core businesses in Europe on sale in May 2018 as it looked to focus on its strip products business.\n\nOrb is part of one of these businesses, Cogent, which makes electrical steels.\n\n\u201cContinuing to fund substantial losses at Orb Electrical Steels is not sustainable at a time when the European steel industry is facing considerable challenges,\u201d said Henrik Adam, chief executive officer of Tata Steel\u2019s European operations.\n\nThe company saw no prospects of the business returning to profitability in the coming years, Adam said.\n\nTata Steel said it would cost the company more than 50 million pounds ($61.39 million) to upgrade the site to produce steel for electric vehicle production.\n\nUnite, UK\u2019s largest trade union, said in a statement it has sought assurances that there would be no compulsory redundancies from Tata Steel after the steelmaker announced Orb\u2019s closure.\n\nTata added it had signed a deal to sell Cogent Power, another division of Cogent, to Japan\u2019s JFE Shoji Trade Corp.\n\nIt also plans to close another non-core business, Wolverhampton Engineering Steels Service Centre, as it did not find a buyer. This could cost up to 26 jobs, it said.\n\nThe news comes weeks after Turkey\u2019s military pension fund OYAK reached a provisional agreement to take over British Steel, which Greybull Capital bought for one pound from Tata Steel three years ago, potentially saving thousands of jobs.\n\nBritish Steel was put into compulsory liquidation on May 22 after Greybull Capital failed to secure funding to continue its operations.\n\n($1 = 0.8145 pounds)", "description": "The Tata Steel Ltd said on Monday it would shut parts of its non-core businesses in the United Kingdom, a move that could cost about 400 jobs.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425412455&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8111H"}
