But the town hasn\u2019t felt very celebratory in the days leading up to the ceremony.\n\nMore than 7,000 television and movie writers are in a bitter standoff with their former talent agents five months after having cut ties with them en masse on the advice of the Writers Guild of America unions. Amid the acrimony, the four major agencies canceled the Emmys parties they usually host this weekend. And many people in the industry are wondering whether any writers or producers will bring up the dispute in an acceptance speech.\n\nThen there\u2019s the show itself: The Emmys broadcast is losing viewers, having dropped to a new low of 10.2 million last year. In an attempt to shake things up, it will go without a host for the first time in 16 years.\n\nPart of the reason has to do with logistics. Fox, the network for this year\u2019s show, doesn\u2019t have a late-night host or sitcom star who would be a natural fit for the job. The last time Fox broadcast the Emmys, in 2015, it turned to its \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d star Andy Samberg. That show was canceled by Fox last year \u2014 and is now part of the NBC lineup.\n\nThe producers have also made changes meant to keep the audience involved. The orchestra has been sent packing. In place of the musicians, piped-in pop songs will fill the Microsoft Theater. And Fox has tapped the actor and comedian Thomas Lennon to offer commentary as the winners make their way to the stage.", "description": "It\u2019s the final night for two longtime Emmy favorites, \u201cVeep\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d but it may not be a lock for either show.", "authors": ["John Koblin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/arts/22emmys-livebriefings-thrones/22emmys-livebriefings-thrones-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
