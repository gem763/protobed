Not even for 500m euros.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Phil\u2019s going nowhere \u2014 Phil IS City. We won\u2019t be signing anyone else for that position.\n\n\u2018When David Silva leaves, we know exactly who our new magician will be\u2019.\n\nGuardiola was criticised for Jadon Sancho\u2019s departure to Dortmund with many claiming he should have given the winger more opportunities at the club.\n\nHowever, Guardiola feels that in Foden City have a player that can be \u2018one of the best\u2019 in the league.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s grown up with us. He\u2019s one of us and he\u2019s going to be brilliant \u2014 one of the Premier League\u2019s best.\u201d\n\n\u2018One thing is clear, Foden has a place in City\u2019s first team.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d be interested to see if a different manager would have given him his chance to develop, or loaned him out.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t like leaving him out of certain games but must think of the whole squad. Phil understands that.\u2019\n\nMORE: Rugby World Cup: England vs France off because of Typhoon Hagibis with Scotland vs Japan in doubt", "description": "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says Phil Foden is being groomed to step into David Silva's boots next season and the club wouldn't listen to any offers for the midfielder....", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178422810_1570691270.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
