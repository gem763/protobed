(Royal Canadian Mounted Police/Royal Canadian Mounted Police)\n\nMax Werenka peered into the depths of Canada\u2019s Griffin Lake. From his perch on a paddle board, the 13-year-old could just make out the outline of a large rectangular object resting about 20 feet below the water\u2019s surface.\n\n\u201cYou could see something almost like a shadow, like an imprint,\u201d Max told The Washington Post. \u201cThen, you could see something shiny.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian teen immediately deduced that the sun was reflecting off part of an exhaust pipe \u2014 he was staring at the underside of a submerged car.\n\nNow, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police say Max\u2019s find was the key to figuring out what happened to a woman who vanished 27 years ago, a missing-persons case that many feared would never be solved.\n\n\u201cThe RCMP will probably be looking at this guy down the road for potential employment,\u201d Cpl. Thomas Blakney told CTV News. \u201cGood detective work on his part.\u201d\n\nIt was a sunny August day when guests staying in the lakeside cabins owned by the Werenka family called the teenager down to the water, his mother, Nancy Werenka, told The Post. The visitors had been exploring near the middle of the lake when they spotted a shiny object in the water and wanted Max to come take a look, Werenka said.\n\nOnce Max and the group determined they had found the sunken car, they returned to the cabins and started combing the Internet for information, Werenka said. The search revealed that four people were rescued in 2009 after their car went into the lake, which is bordered by a portion of the Trans-Canada Highway that runs through the mountains of southeastern British Columbia.\n\n\u201cAt that point in time, we just kind of assumed that this car had been remaining from that 2009 rescue,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t call it in. \u2026 We didn\u2019t really think much of it.\u201d\n\nThat all changed the next day when an RCMP officer from the nearby city of Revelstoke came to the lake for a picnic with his relatives, Werenka said.\n\n\u201cWe just mentioned to that officer that there was a vehicle in the lake and we couldn\u2019t believe that it wasn\u2019t retrieved from the original rescue,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said to us, 'Well, no actually, pretty sure that vehicle was retrieved out of the lake, so we need to investigate this further.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSoon after, Werenka said a couple of Mounties were dispatched to the property and Max led them to a spot about 10 feet away from the part of the lake\u2019s western shore that hugs the highway. The water conditions, however, made it difficult to see the car from the surface, so Max grabbed his GoPro, his mother said. Holding the waterproof camera, the teen dove into the water, recording the entire time. In the footage, which was later given to the officers, an upside down car can clearly be seen resting on the lake\u2019s rocky bottom.\n\n\n\nA still image taken from a GoPro video of a car submerged in Griffin Lake in British Columbia.

An \u201colder model Honda Accord\u201d was pulled out of the lake and inside, authorities made a grisly discovery \u2014 a woman\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cIt was very shocking,\u201d Max said, noting that he had been curious about what happened to the driver when he saw the car emerge from the water with all its windows and doors shut. \u201cWe were surprised. We weren\u2019t expecting anything like this.\u201d\n\nBlakney told CTV News that divers were able to get the car\u2019s license plate and soon had a name: Janet Farris, a 69-year-old woman from Vancouver Island who went missing in the fall of 1992 while driving by herself to a wedding in Alberta.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks later, we received a phone call from that family in Alberta asking why she never came to the wedding,\u201d Farris\u2019s granddaughter, Erin Farris-Hartley, told Global News, \u201cso she had actually been missing for two weeks with nobody knowing.\u201d\n\nAs time passed and Farris\u2019s disappearance continued to go unsolved, her family started to come up with their own explanations.\n\n\u201cWe kind of assumed that maybe she had gone off the road or fallen asleep, or tried to avoid an accident or animal on the road,\u201d Farris\u2019s son, George Farris told Canadian Broadcasting Corp.\n\nBack when Farris traveled on the highway, Werenka told The Post that the stretch of road closest to Griffin Lake was narrower than it is now and \u201cthere were no cement barricades\u201d separating cars from the steep embankment.\n\nIn the August release, police said they did not believe any criminality was involved in the crash.\n\nFinding Farris, Werenka said, was the result of \u201ca whole series of coincidences.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just a really, really sad story,\u201d she added.\n\nBut Farris-Hartley said Max\u2019s efforts have given her family \u201ca lot of peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dad and my uncle and our whole family are so thankful to him,\u201d she told Global News.", "description": "\u201cThe RCMP will probably be looking at this guy down the road for potential employment,\u201d Cpl.
