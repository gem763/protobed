And that breaks my heart.\u201d\n\nMATT LAUER CLAIMS SECRET DOOR-LOCKING BUTTON AT NBC OFFICE 'DIDN'T EXIST'\n\nREVELATION OF DISGRACED MATT LAUER'S 'SECRET DOOR BUTTON' RAISES EYEBROW\n\nThe comment came after shocking allegations about Lauer, reportedly revealed in an upcoming book by Ronan Farrow, drew a sharp and somber reaction from the disgraced anchor\u2019s former colleagues on \u201cToday\u201d Wednesday.\n\nLauer, who was fired from NBC News for sexual misconduct in 2017, was accused of a sex crime in graphic detail in a Variety article, which reported reading the bombshell claims in a copy of Farrow\u2019s upcoming book \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d that it obtained.\n\n\u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague,\u201d NBC News said in a statement that was read on air.\n\nLauer denied the graphic rape claim in a strongly worded letter that his lawyer provided to Fox News on Wednesday, in which the former \u201cToday\u201d co-host said he initially was quiet for the sake of his children -- but will now defend himself.\n\nMATT LAUER DENIES GRAPHIC RAPE CLAIM, SAYS SEX WITH NBC NEWS COLLEAGUE 'COMPLETELY CONSENSUAL'\n\n\u201cIt is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault. It is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense,\u201d Lauer wrote.\n\n\u201cI had an extramarital affair with [a colleague] in 2014. It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia. We engaged in a variety of sexual acts... each act was mutual and completely consensual,\u201d Lauer added.\n\nBut, as Variety reported, Farrow wrote that the former NBC News employee -- whose complaint eventually led to Lauer\u2019s firing in 2017 -- said the incident occurred after she ran into Lauer at a hotel bar over drinks with Meredith Viera during the Sochi Olympics.\n\nFox News is not naming the alleged victim at this time, despite Farrow, Variety and Lauer\u2019s attorney each revealing her identity.\n\nFarrow reportedly wrote that the accuser went to Lauer\u2019s hotel room twice that night, first because Lauer jokingly took her press credentials and a second time because the ex-NBC News host invited her back.\n\nShe \u201chad no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience,\u201d Farrow wrote, according to Variety.\n\nThe accuser reportedly told Farrow that on the second visit to his room, Lauer kissed her against the door then flipped her over on the bed and asked her if she \u201cliked anal sex.\u201d\n\nFarrow reportedly wrote that the alleged victim said she didn\u2019t want to partake in the act several times before she eventually cried into a pillow while Lauer proceeded without her consent. According to Variety, the accuser indicated that she was in pain for several days after the 'nonconsensual\" incident.\n\nNBC News Chairman Andy Lack, a key figure of the Variety report, also issued a statement that was read aloud on \"Today.\"\n\n\"Our highest priority is to ensure we have a workplace environment where everyone feels safe and protected. We are absolutely committed to making this a reality. There can be no exception,\u201d Lack said.\n\nIn 2018, Lauer issued a statement that denied all alleged wrongdoing, which was re-aired on \u201cToday\u201d on Wednesday in regards to the latest allegation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI want to make it perfectly clear that any allegations or reports of coercive, aggressive or abusive behavior actions on my part, at any time, are absolutely false,\u201d Lauer said at the time in the re-broadcast clip.\n\nFox News has not seen a copy of the closely guarded book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d which is set to be released Oct. 15.", "description": "Former \u201cToday\u201d anchor Ann Curry declared she believes the rape allegation leveled against her former colleague Matt Lauer, saying it \u201cbreaks her heart.\u201d", "authors": ["Liam Quinn", "Liam Quinn Is A Senior Editor At Fox News.
