This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.21 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Agco was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.
