But sometimes, that hot new thing isn\u2019t always hot. The cannabis sector has seen a sharp decline in recent months. Major players, like Canopy Growth (CGC) and Aurora Cannabis (ACB), are down by a third or more since the spring. The reasons are varied \u2013 licensing bottlenecks in Health Canada, supply and distribution difficulties in a new market, management turnover at Canopy \u2013 but the result is clear: the big cannabis companies are not delivering results so far.\n\nBut there is still money to be made in the cannabis industry. The product is in demand; the problems the big suppliers face are more in the nature of growing pains. So, to profit, investors will benefit by thinking outside of the grow house. We\u2019ve dipped into TipRanks\u2019 stock database and found three companies that are thriving as service providers for the cannabis industry.\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)\n\nThis company is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), focused on the cannabis industry. Innovative buys and manages industrial properties which it then leases to cannabis growers. It\u2019s a profitable model, and the company\u2019s Q2 earnings result bear that out. IIRP reported gains of 155% in both revenues and net income, with the former coming in at $8.28 million and the latter at $3.07 million. EPS, at 30 cents, was up 76%.\n\nAccording to Exec. Chairman Alan Gold, IIPR has operations in 26 states, with over 2 million square feet leased long-term to cannabis growers. The average remaining lease term is over 15 years, and the properties have a current blended yield of 14.6%. CEO Paul Smithers noted that industry analysts see plenty of momentum in cannabis. In his comments on the earnings, he quoted sources projecting \u201ca 35% increase in US regulated cannabis sales from 2018 to 2019, and reaching nearly $30 billion by 2023.\u201d The current operations, and the prospects for near-term growth, provide IIPR with both a solid foundation and an upbeat outlook.\n\nIn an added boon for investors, IIPR has been paying out a quarterly dividend over the past two years, with regular increases in the disbursement. The current yield is 2.16%, and the payment is $1.80 annualized. The July quarterly payment of 60 cents per share marked a 140% increase year-over-year.\n\nRight now, IIPR has one analyst rating, from James Sullivan of BTIG. Sullivan, a 4-star analyst, leads the REIT research team at BTIG. He gives IIPR a $151 price target, suggesting an impressive 81% upside. It\u2019s a clear sign of confidence in the real estate aspect of the cannabis industry.\n\nScotts Miracle-Gro Company (SMG)\n\nLand is important, but cannabis industry relies on increasing production and multiple harvests per year to maximize revenue. This requires greenhouses and other controlled growing facilities \u2013 letting the plants grow wild outdoors simply won\u2019t cut it. And greenhouses are where Scotts Miracle-Gro comes in.\n\nThe company may be best known for its Miracle-Gro weed killer and other home gardening products, but its Hawthorne subsidiary is deeply involved in the cannabis industry. Where IIPR provides the real estate needed by the growers, Scotts provides the hydroponic and lighting systems necessary for large-scale indoor cultivation of cannabis. In fact, the company\u2019s annual sales growth of hydroponic systems has outpaced that of traditional lawn and garden gear for the last three years. In a 2016 interview, CEO Jim Hagedorn laid out a vision of marijuana ancillary products as the future of his company: \u201cWe\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s beyond stopping. And we\u2019re not getting into pot growing. We\u2019re talking dirt, fertilizer, pesticides, growing systems, lights. You know it\u2019s a multibillion-dollar business...\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "Since Canada enacted nation-wide legalization of marijuana in October 2018, cannabis companies have been the hot new thing in stock investing.
