While Powell strongly rejects that notion, the president\u2019s policies have clearly forced the central bank\u2019s hand.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Fed, which last December was considering hiking interest rates at least twice this year, has done a head-spinning turn since then in response to weakening business investment, a contraction in manufacturing and a global slowdown \u2014 all fueled by Trump\u2019s trade wars.\n\nAnd the president\u2019s abrupt decision last year to pull out of the Iran nuclear accord arguably set off a steady deterioration in relations that today has made Middle East tensions another threat to economic growth that the Fed must take into account.\n\nTrump is forcing still more dramatic policy options into the limelight \u2014 including his latest call on the Fed to cut rates below zero, an idea that the central bank has long resisted as an avenue for fighting recessions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought the Fed has been a little bit slow to control the narrative about monetary policy,\u201d said Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at Swiss bank UBS and a former Fed official. \u201cThrow Trump into the mix, and you\u2019re in a completely different circumstance where he does like to drive the narrative.\n\n\u201cYou just end up being dragged around,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Fed has repeatedly pointed to trade tensions, slowing global growth and muted inflation as its main reasons for lowering rates, a move intended to support the economy as recession fears have begun to creep into the Treasury bond market.\n\nBut the economy is still growing, with consumer spending powering it forward and the labor market continuing to add jobs, suggesting some room for optimism about the future of the expansion, the longest in U.S. history.\n\nMorning Money Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

After the central bank lowered rates in July \u2014 its first cut in more than a decade \u2014 Powell suggested that the Fed wasn\u2019t yet embarking on a full-blown cutting cycle. But markets are expecting several more reductions between now and early next year and will be watching the chairman closely for signals on that front.\n\nBut those decisions will be driven, at least in part, by the outcome of the U.S.-China trade war, meaning the Fed, like the rest of Washington, will continue to keep an eye on Trump\u2019s Twitter storms.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Trump tweets, often daily, that the Fed is clueless and that if it would only slash rates by a large amount, the economy would take off like a \u201crocket ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States, because of the Federal Reserve, is paying a MUCH higher Interest Rate than other competing countries,\u201d the president tweeted on Monday. \u201cThey can\u2019t believe how lucky they are that Jay Powell & the Fed don\u2019t have a clue,\u201d he added, calling for a \u201cBig Interest Rate Drop.\u201d\n\nHis recent attempt to push the Fed to pursue negative interest rates \u2014 a move tried in Europe and Japan with unclear results \u2014 demonstrates the shift in who is controlling the narrative around the Fed.\n\nA decade ago, the central bank pursued a range of new and untested policies to jump-start the economy \u2014 such as purchasing trillions of dollars in government bonds \u2014 and faced challenges in getting the public on board. Now, while the pursuit of negative rates in the U.S. would still be highly controversial, Trump is the one driving the conversation toward unconventional policies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no escaping the president\u2019s bully pulpit, no matter what it is he\u2019s talking about, not the least when it comes in the form of a tweet where it gets promoted and dissected,\u201d said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University. \u201cIt focuses media attention. It focuses public attention.\u201d\n\nTrump has also urged the Fed to help him more directly fight his trade wars, focusing much of his frustration on the heft of the dollar, whose strength makes U.S. exports more expensive.\n\nHe has gone from suggesting the central bank cut its main borrowing rate by a whole percentage point \u2014 the equivalent of four standard cuts \u2014 to now calling for rates of \u201cZERO, or less,\u201d which would mean lowering rates by at least 2 percentage points.\n\n\u201cHe certainly is the big elephant in the room,\u201d Binder said.\n\n\u201cIf part of [Fed] communications is telling markets and the public and businesses where you\u2019re headed, and if people wonder where they\u2019re headed because the president has now injected himself into the debate \u2026 then that kind of undermines the whole use of communications as the central tool\u201d of monetary policy, she added.\n\nAs for the Fed\u2019s ultimate decisions on rates, Carpenter said he believes central bank officials when they insist that they do not discuss the political implications of their decisions at their policy meetings. But, he said, the pressure likely makes them more cautious.\n\n\u201cTheir lives are just made that much more complicated by having to second-guess themselves, and saying, \u2018OK, now we\u2019ve made a decision, let\u2019s ask ourselves one more time, are we sure we\u2019re doing this for the right reasons?\u2018\u201d", "description": "Is Jerome Powell caving to public pressure by the president?", "authors": ["Victoria Guida"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f0/8e/f094edd748518ca4b3bf21f6bd02/190917-trump-powell-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
