For children, a collision was only avoided 11% of the time at 20 miles (32 kilometres) per hour.\n\nFor its tests, AAA used four different, 2019 model cars: Chevrolet Malibu, Honda Accord, Tesla Model 3, and Toyota Camry. All the cars had their manufacturers' specific automatic braking tech.\n\nThe sedans were then driven on closed streets at a speedway in California, where researchers drove the cars at pedestrian-sized dummies that were moving across the road like a normal person would walk. The brake pedal wasn't pushed until after the car made contact with the fake pedestrian, in order to monitor any warning lights as well as speed reduction due to any automatic braking that engaged.\n\nAs you might expect, the systems performed even worse during nighttime when there's less light. To be sure, however, researchers note that most vehicles' manufacturers warn the systems may not function as well during these times.\n\nThere is some good news, luckily.\n\nWhen tested on adult-sized dummies, \"each test vehicle provided visual notification of an impending collision during each test run conducted at 20 mph,\" and successfully avoided the collision 40% of the time, while reducing impact speed by about 6 miles (9 kilometres) per hour.\n\nBut when coming around a corner, \"none of the test vehicles mitigated the impact speed during any of the five test runs.\"\n\n\"Never rely on pedestrian detection systems to avoid a collision,\" AAA reminded drivers in its report. \"These systems serve as a backup rather than a primary means of collision avoidance.\"", "description": "Cars still hit a child-size dummy 89% of the time, AAA found in its research on four new vehicles equipped with the safety features.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9441/4ef733eb541449fd9aa4197fefa20463.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
