They\u2019re terrified of proscription.\u201d\n\nThe same tactic was successfully adopted for years by Anjem Choudary\u2019s al-Muhajiroun Islamist network, until it was banned as a terrorist organisation after numerous members carried out or attempted attacks.\n\nGeneration Identity\u2019s leaders \u2013 like Choudary in the 2000s \u2013 deny calling for violence and say they vet members to root out extremists and neo-Nazis.\n\nActivists are encouraged to be \u201cwell-groomed\u201d and are coached in the language of \u201cethno-cultural identity\u201d, with leaflets handed out at protests listing chants talking of immigration and \u201cIslamisation\u201d, rather than Muslims and race.\n\nA researcher who went undercover in Generation Identity as its British branch was being set up in late 2017 recalled training on how to rebuff racism accusations from journalists.\n\nJulia Ebner, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said leaders give \u201cvery clear instructions on how to ensure they\u2019re never operating beyond the law\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to exclude members who demonstrate a willingness to use violence but they are also pandering to that audience,\u201d she told The Independent.\n\n\u201cIn the German-speaking world they are a priority for the security services.\u201d\n\nMr Van der Merwe said Generation Identity\u2019s goal is to \u201cshift public opinion towards ethnic cleansing\u201d, sparking the election of far-right governments with extreme immigration policies across Europe.\n\nBut leaders privately recognise that the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d ideology inspired massacres in Christchurch and elsewhere, he said.\n\nRecalling the aftermath of the El Paso shooting, which left 22 victims dead in August, Mr Van der Merwe said: \u201cThe overwhelming response was concern about proscription and brand damage \u2026 they agreed with the aims but not the methods, which they thought would get them banned or marginalised.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that they have inspired attacks and probably will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies have repeatedly vowed to crack down on extremists, but The Independent found more than a dozen Twitter accounts being operated by Generation Identity branches and leaders in the UK, France, Germany and Austria.\n\nTwitter said it bans users from \u201cpromoting violence against, directly attacking or threatening people on the basis of protected categories such as race, ethnicity and national origin\u201d.\n\nGeneration Identity UK, which has renamed itself the Identitarian Movement following a split with European leaders, claimed it was \u201cpreposterous\u201d to suggest its ideology causes violence.\n\nLeader Ben Jones said the group regards the Christchurch attack \u201cas a tragedy\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are aware of increasingly authoritarian tendencies in this country, we therefore accept that it\u2019s imperative to our ethics and strategy to operate within the law.\u201d\n\nGeneration Identity\u2019s European leadership said it no longer has official ties to the UK branch.\n\nThe Home Office said an upcoming report by the independent Commission for Countering Extremism would help combat the threat from extreme right-wing groups.\n\nA spokesperson added: \u201cThe government is serious about tackling all forms of extremism and are committed to tackling the damaging ideology of groups like Generation Identity, including stopping individuals entering the UK from overseas when their purpose is to spread hatred and division.\u201d", "description": "Counterterror police have admitted they have \u201cno plan\u201d to tackle a white nationalist group spreading the ideology that inspired attacks including Christchurch and El Paso.", "authors": ["Lizzie Dearden"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/08/18/generation-identity-bristol.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
