They are having to learn the art of winning on the shop floor, and that\u2019s a huge ask.\u2019\n\nIs Marcus Rashford getting fatigued by the burden of responsibility? (Picture: Getty)\n\nLiverpool meanwhile have built a team that has reached two consecutive Champions League finals, beating Spurs in the second one, and has its best chance in years to win a first Premier League title.\n\nWinning that trophy would only serve to highlight the gulf between the two sides who Savage believes are now almost in different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSavage added: \u2018Klopp has spent \u00a3395million on new players since he became Liverpool manager in October 2015 \u2013 with a net spend of just under \u00a370m.\n\n\u2018In that time, he has delivered the European Cup to Anfield, reached four other major finals, and is currently sitting pretty on an eight-point lead at the top of the Premier League.\n\n\u2018Contrast Klopp\u2019s ascent with United\u2019s wretched decline since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. Over the last six seasons, United have finished an average of 21.5 points behind the champions.\n\n\u2018And although it pains me to say so, they are now an irrelevance in the title race.\u2019", "description": "Manchester United will have a front-row seat to the performance of the team they should be trying to emulate when they take on Liverpool at Old Trafford tomorrow, according to...", "authors": ["James Gray"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/themes/metro-parent/img/default-metro-user.png?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=512%2C512&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
