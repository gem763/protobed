Why is this sign on my child\u2019s shoulder?\u2019\u201d Zinger told USA Today.\n\nVideo shared by Zinger shows the masked employee gesturing for the little girl, who has autism, to come over for a photo at Universal\u2019s Loews Royal Pacific Resort. Once the girl is standing in front of the employee, that individual puts their right hand on her shoulder and after a pause their index finger curls in to make a distinct circle with their thumb. The individual then holds this shape for the duration of the video.\n\nThe once innocent OK symbol has recently taken on a more sinister meaning as some use it to promote \u201cwhite power,\u201d according to the Anti-Defamation League. It started as an online hoax on the website 4chan, with hoaxers hoping that the media and liberals would overreact to something that wasn\u2019t true. Then, \u201cironically some white supremacists themselves soon also participated in such trolling tactics, lending an actual credence to those who labeled the trolling gesture as racist in nature,\u201d the ADL\u2019s website explains.\n\nToday the gesture is used by blatant white nationalists as a wink to likeminded people. Prominent white supremacist Faith Goldy, for example, made the sign in videos on Facebook to promote bigoted views in her home country of Canada. Those videos were later banned from Facebook for breaking the platform\u2019s anti-hate rules.\n\nAvowed white supremacist Brenton Tarrant, who has been charged in the fatal shooting of 51 people in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, flashed the hand symbol during a court appearance in March. This made headlines one week before the Zinger photo was taken.\n\ncveltri via Getty Images A representative for Universal Orlando confirmed the employee\u2019s removal from the park and said the company is in contact with the Zinger family.\n\nZinger described the incident involving her daughter as \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been emotionally distraught over it. I\u2019m still pretty upset that, you know, someone felt that they needed to do this to children,\u201d she said.\n\nA representative for Universal Orlando confirmed the employee\u2019s removal from the park in a statement to HuffPost on Wednesday and said the company remains in contact with the family.\n\n\u201cWe never want our guests to experience what this family did. This is not acceptable and we are sorry \u2015 and we are taking steps to make sure nothing like this happens again,\u201d the company said.\n\nZinger and her husband Richard Zinger told USA Today that they hired an attorney after a lawyer for Universal reached out to them, although they said they\u2019re not motivated to seek financial compensation.", "description": "The hand gesture has been used to symbolize white power.
