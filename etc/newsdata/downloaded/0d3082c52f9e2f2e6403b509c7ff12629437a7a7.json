A new business strategy, which involves rightsizing of the workforce, is being implemented in a bid to steer the company out of a financial crisis.\n\nActing CEO Siza Mzimela said the airline had withdrawn from servicing routes between Johannesburg and Richards Bay, Johannesburg and George, and cut out the Durban hub to focus on its Johannesburg and Cape Town hubs.\n\nMzimela said one of the challenges identified was that the airline had in the past \"spread itself too thinly\" and it will now focus on markets where its services are most required.\n\nLike some other state-owned entities, SA Express has been impacted by allegations of irregularly expenditure and corruption.\n\nEvidence presented before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture has detailed numerous acts irregular financial conduct in the awarding of contracts by the airline, including the 2015 contract between the airline and the North West Department of Safety and Transport to operate the Mafikeng and Pilanesberg airport.\n\nThaver said an investigations into the North West contract were underway.", "description": "Struggling domestic and regional carrier SA Express is confident that it is making progress stabilising its business, following the recent grounding of its aircrafts over debt.", "authors": ["Sibongile Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9031/8967a3b5771c4444b2b95e0f8be0dc7a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
