Once per month, the bar\u2019s owners invite guests to movie nights on the plant-covered back patio. \u201cHalloween\u201d is an obvious theme for October, but the vibe is more \u201chilarity\u201d than \u201chorror,\u201d with a double feature of \u201cHocus Pocus\u201d and \u201cBeetlejuice.\u201d Admission includes a guaranteed seat, house-made popcorn and one drink; More beverages and snacks, such as empanadas and choripan, are available for purchase. 6:30 to 11 p.m. $25-$30.\n\nAD\n\nTuesday, Oct. 22\n\nAD\n\nWashington Nationals World Series watch parties: For the first time since 1933, Washington has a team in the World Series. The. World. Series. Baseball fans are excited, and bars around the city are ready with viewing parties and happy hours \u2014 even the bars where, just a few months ago, you had to plead with the bartender to change the channel to a Nationals game. Whether you\u2019re rocking a Terrmel Sledge jersey or you just leaped onto the \u201cBaby Shark\u201d bandwagon, you want a bar offering a #StayInTheFight atmosphere as well as food and drink specials when the Fall Classic begins. OG Nationals bar Duffy\u2019s Irish Pub offers $4 tallboys and $5 shorts during every game. If you want to stay close to the ballpark when the team is away, head toward the Salt Line for half-price oysters, $3 Narragansett, $5 DC Brau or wine, and $7 draft cocktails. Time TBD.\n\nAD\n\nYoung Thug at the Anthem: Ever since Young Thug landed on the musical landscape like an alien visiting our planet, rap purists haven\u2019t known what to make of the iconoclast with the chameleonic voice box and outr\u00e9 fashion sense. No matter: The 28-year-old ATLien has remained rap\u2019s foremost pioneer, reshaping the whole scene in his own image. But despite a handful of instant-classic mix tapes, hip-hop heads handwringed about his ability to pull it all together on a proper album. Thug\u2019s answer is \u201cSo Much Fun,\u201d an hour-long exploration of what makes him so special: his effervescent, elastic vocals. \u201cNo time for gibberish,\u201d he raps, \u201call the critics hearin\u2019 this.\u201d 8 p.m. $50-$75.\n\nAD\n\n\u2018Right to Be Forgotten\u2019 at Arena Stage: In \u201cRight to Be Forgotten,\u201d which explores the question of whether people\u2019s past indiscretions should live forever online, playwright Sharyn Rothstein has processed the perks and perils of the digital age. With such contemporary material comes relevance \u2014 to the current cultural dialogue \u2014 and a responsibility to monitor the news cycle. To channel the all-encompassing sprawl of the Internet, director Seema Sueko collaborated with scenic designer Paige Hathaway and projection designer Shawn Duan to give the show a layered visual aesthetic. A sea of binary code is projected against the wooden walls of Arena\u2019s Kogod Cradle to create the sense that the online world is \u201coverwhelming and suffocating\u201d the characters, Sueko says. Showtimes vary through Nov. 10. $82-$115.\n\nAD\n\nWednesday, Oct. 23\n\nAD\n\nPub Grimm at Pop-Up Bar: For this year\u2019s Halloween pop-up bar, the clever bar-builders at Drink Company eschew zombies, blood and creepy dolls, instead invoking the Black Forest of the Brothers Grimm. Throughout the five rooms, there are allusions to some of the Grimms\u2019 more gory stories, such as \u201cThe White Bride and the Black One\u201d and \u201cOne-Eye, Two-Eyes and Three-Eyes,\u201d as well as Rapunzel\u2019s tower and Cinderella\u2019s Insta-ready glass slipper. The food and drink is German, with sausages and pretzels from the Berliner, and several cocktails with the Black Forest\u2019s Monkey 47 gin. Open at 5 p.m. through Nov. 3. Closed Mondays. Free admission.\n\nPumpkin painting at Slash Run: Spooky season is in full swing, but if you\u2019re not in the mood to dress up just yet, head to the Petworth burger bar for a relaxing night of pumpkin painting. Ten bucks gets you a pumpkin and access to paint supplies, and the bar will also serve up hot spiced cider for $8. All ages are welcome for pumpkin decorating, though a horror flick will play later in the evening. 5 to 11 p.m. $10.\n\nAD\n\nThursday, Oct. 24\n\nAD\n\nBentzen Ball at various venues: Brightest Young Things was just a scrappy hipster blog when it teamed with comedian Tig Notaro in 2009 to launch the Bentzen Ball comedy festival. It\u2019s now been a decade since that inaugural festival, which, save for a brief hiatus, routinely brings the brightest names in comedy to D.C. The festival is staging its biggest show yet this year: A stand-up showcase at D.C.\u2019s new Entertainment and Sports Arena on Oct. 26 that will bring a number of comedians with ties to the area back home, including Jay Pharoah (\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d), Aparna Nancherla (\u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d), Rory Scovel (\u201cI Feel Pretty\u201d) and Jermaine Fowler (\u201cSuperior Donuts\u201d).

Franklin Hall\u2019s annual pumpkin carving competition is a chance to show off your skills in a happy hour environment: The $10 entry fee includes a pint of Hellbender beer as well as a gourd and carving supplies. Start planning your design now, as a private tour of Hellbender and bar tabs are among the prizes up for grabs, and arrive early to claim a great pumpkin. 7 to 9 p.m. $7 for one pumpkin; $10 for pumpkin and beer.\n\nAD\n\n\u2018Jitney\u2019 at Arena Stage: Five gypsy cab drivers in a ramshackle office in Pittsburgh, 1977. You summon this mundane premise and now, your job is to turn it into a play. Could you? A highly improbable result would be a consistently funny and absorbing evening that revealed the flaws and disappointments afflicting these characters, and the rhythms of a hardscrabble livelihood in a blighted neighborhood. Well, the late, great August Wilson could, and did, in \u201cJitney,\u201d the spiky comedy-drama of multiple odd couples that is raising risible Cain at Arena Stage. Through Sunday. $41-$105.\n\nAD\n\nNina Kraviz at U Street Music Hall: Born in Siberia and based in Moscow, Russian DJ-producer-vocalist Nina Kraviz has spent much of the decade meandering across the house and techno spectrum. From Dance Mania-inspired bangers to acid techno to more ambient material, Kraviz delivers it all, whether on her records, in her sets or via her own label, \u0442\u0440\u0438\u043f (pronounced \u201ctrip\u201d). She\u2019s racked up accolades along the way, but also an undue amount of criticism \u2014 about the content of her sets, or where she shoots interviews \u2014 that often is aimed at women in a male-dominated electronic dance music world. 10 p.m. $35-$40.\n\nFriday, Oct. 25\n\nAD\n\nSleater-Kinney at the Anthem: Pioneering Washington state indie-rock band Sleater-Kinney has resumed the band\u2019s 2015 reunion with one major change: drummer Janet Weiss left the group after recording Sleater-Kinney\u2019s ninth album, \u201cThe Center Won\u2019t Hold,\u201d which dropped in August. Founding singers/guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein are carrying on without Weiss to tour behind the record, which was produced by Annie Clark (a.k.a. St. Vincent) \u2014 a dream union for fans of both acts. Clark\u2019s influence is all over \u201cThe Center Won\u2019t Hold,\u201d which sounds bigger and sleeker than 2015\u2019s reunion record \u201cNo Cities to Love,\u201d but still maintains the political angst and punk energy of the band\u2019s early output. 8 p.m. $37.50.\n\nAD\n\nNight of the Living Zoo at the National Zoo: Kids got all dressed up to trick or treat at the National Zoo\u2019s annual family-friendly Halloween extravaganza Boo at the Zoo last weekend. This weekend, it\u2019s the grown-ups\u2019 turn to party in costume. The adults-only Night of the Living Zoo event offers access to animal houses and exhibits after-hours, along with such fun and spooky extras as food trucks, a costume contest, roving performing artists, a D.J. and beer from craft breweries (the price of admission includes two drink tickets). 7 to 10:30 p.m. $30-$90.\n\nBalletX at the Kennedy Center: The adventurous Philadelphia company BalletX once danced through the halls of Union Market to the music of indie band Beirut.

Robert Fairchild, another NYCB alum, will join BalletX for this special program, with music from Kate Davis and Catalyst Quartet. Through Saturday. 7:30 p.m. $55-$65.\n\nAD\n\nWylder at the Soundry: Wylder singer-guitarist Will McCarry is the first to admit that he\u2019s the driving force behind the band\u2019s ethereal indie-rock sound. \u201cWylder has been an exercise in the three of [my bandmates] indulging my sensibilities,\u201d McCarry says. \u201cThe choices that we made on [new album] \u2018Golden Age Thinking\u2019 are informed by the kind of record that I\u2019ve had in my head for a long time.\u201d That album, released in July, is full of lush strings, nervous energy and big harmonies, while also shedding some of the more traditional folk influences from the band\u2019s 2016 debut \u201cRain and Laura.\u201d 8 p.m. $10-$15.\n\n\u2014 Hau Chu, Fritz Hahn, Adele Chapin, Thomas Floyd, Rudi Greenberg, Mark Jenkins, Chris Kelly and Peter Marks\n\nAD", "description": "Catch a spooky double feature at a great new bar in Petworth, watch the Nationals start their World Series run, and laugh at one of the city's best comedy festivals.", "authors": ["Going Out Guide Staff"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2J3NsmcI9OXajaQbsBdsVJynZak=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7PKNIAHQJQI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
