The slow bus traffic is almost entirely caused by parked cars obstructing traffic and hindering the ability of buses to access and egress bus stops.\n\nThe biggest problem is that car owners flout rush hour parking bans on the city\u2019s major arteries with impunity. From 7-9:30am and again from 4\u20146:30 parking is ostensibly prohibited on most streets, but it is haphazardly enforced at best\u2014on some streets the ban is completely ignored.\n\nJust a few illegally parked cars create traffic bottlenecks, slowing traffic for everyone but buses most of all, since they typically need to hew to the right lanes occupied by parked cars. For instance, at Connecticut and M there is a (too short) space between stops for buses traveling north. Without parked cars in the way, buses can remain in the right lane to cross M street and advance to the next stop 300 feet ahead, and remain in the lane until it reaches Dupont Circle.\n\nHowever, there are invariably cars sitting in those lanes, even during rush hour, and their presence requires buses wait for a red light (or two) to merge into traffic, making a one block sojourn a 3-5 minute affair. This also occurs at S Street and Florida Avenue.\n\nWhen the bus goes around Dupont Circle its riders need to hope that a car isn\u2019t illegally parked in front of the Starbucks on the north side of the circle\u2014a common occurrence that precludes a bus from advancing at all until the owner shows up and moves it.\n\nIn Adams Morgan the ubiquity of parked cars hinder bus traffic at all hours of the day, creating myriad bus bottlenecks that could be eliminated if the city prohibited parking in front of stops. For instance, L2 buses traveling on Calvert Street must slow down and wait for traffic to ease before advancing on three different stops in Adams Morgan. If the city dedicated the space for bus traffic it would save thousands of bus riders three to five minutes in their commute. Some of these spots are literally in front of a parking garage.\n\nThe city treats residential parking as a scarce natural resource to be conserved at any cost and no one considers trading off parking spots to speed up bus traffic, no doubt because people who own cars tend to be wealthy, politically active, and vocal about their right to park on the street. On the other hand, bus riders are younger and poorer and don\u2019t have the wherewithal to send emails to neighborhood listservs to complain about their commute. It\u2019s easier for a city council member or ANC member to avoid the blowback and leave parking alone.\n\nThe implicit calculus of our current parking arrangement is grotesque: We make thousands bus rider -sacrifice a few minutes of their time so that a few wealthy car owners can store their car on the street for a pittance.\n\nRationalizing our parking laws would not cost the city a dime: in fact, if it were to charge something akin to the market price for car storage on residential streets and increase parking fines to a level that would deter illegal parking, the city would be able to more than pay for increased parking enforcement and have money left over. It would also be wildly progressive.\n\nAnd to be clear, most people are not parking their cars on residential streets but storing them; the majority of cars sitting on curbs in Adams-Morgan are not used in a typical week: they are toys to be used for occasional jaunts or even storage.\n\nRethinking DC\u2019s policies on parking on city streets would not only speed up bus traffic, but it would also reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions while improving pedestrian safety, each of which are supposedly priorities of the mayor and city council. Charging a market price for the right to store a car on city streets would also take away some of the vitriol that greets any new residential development in our part of town, which is driven largely by fears of more competition for residential on-street parking.\n\nThat our government acquiesces to the status quo \u2014 a proposal to modestly raise the $35 residential parking fee went nowhere \u2014 reveals that we would rather avoid inconveniencing a few loud and wealthy car owners than advance various progressive priorities.\n\nIssuing this report was a complete waste as it is perfectly obvious how we can speed up bus traffic. It\u2019s too bad that Washington has no compunction to address it.\n\n\u2022 Ike Brannon is a senior fellow at the Jack Kemp Foundation.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
