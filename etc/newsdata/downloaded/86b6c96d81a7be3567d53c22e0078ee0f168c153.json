Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nA Senate Republican staffer told NPR that Trump would nominate Cuccinelli for the job so long as he believed Senate leadership would confirm the nomination. Any torpedoing of one of Trump\u2019s nominees in an election year, sources have said, could be met with serious backlash from GOP voters.\n\n\u201cEnough with the acting secretaries \u2014 come together and confirm someone who works well with the president and is totally in line with his immigration agenda,\u201d Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) President Dan Stein told NPR.\n\nFor more than two years, DHS has been slow to execute the president\u2019s most vital campaign promise: The construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThus far, under the leadership of Nielsen and McAleenan, only 70 to 74 miles of border wall have been constructed \u2014 indicating that more than 400 miles of border wall will need to be constructed within the next year to follow through on Trump\u2019s promise that 500 miles will be finished in time for the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHowever, Cuccinelli is opposed by some officials who say he will not win confirmation from the Senate, and that he cannot be appointed as acting chief of DHS. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to waste,\u201d said a former DHS official.\n\nDHS policy chief Chad Wolf would be a better pick for the job, the former official said. He served as Nielsen\u2019s chief of staff, so he knows how to get Trump\u2019s priorities through the agency bureaucracy, the official said. That knowledge \u201cis worth your weight in gold \u2026 Chad Wolf would be a great choice.\u201d\n\nWolf\u2019s background dates back to the early 2000s, when he worked in former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Wolf eventually went to work as a lobbyist, representing NASSCOM, a leader in the outsourcing industry that uses many H-1B visas to replace American workforces with Indian workforces.\n\nNeil Munro contributed to this report.
