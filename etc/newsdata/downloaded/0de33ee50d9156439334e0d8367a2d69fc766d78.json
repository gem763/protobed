Mark Sanford\u2019s primary challenge to President Trump is being dismissed by the lawmaker\u2019s friends in the House Freedom Caucus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gnat on the back of a water buffalo type of thing,\u201d Rep. Andy Biggs, the newly elected chairman of the conservative House Republican group, told The Washington Times.\n\n\u201cThe president is not overly concerned with him,\u201d said the Arizona Republican. \u201cYou know Mark\u2019s out there. It\u2019s a chaotic type of effort. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna do anything.\u201d\n\nMr. Biggs agreed with his friend\u2019s focus on addressing fiscal issues such as the rising national debt but said it wouldn\u2019t be able to make a dent in the president\u2019s overwhelming popularity with the Republican base.\n\n\u201cBecause if you\u2019re a Never-Trumper, you\u2019re still going to be a Never-Trumper. And if you\u2019re a Trumper, you\u2019re going to be a Trumper,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Sanford, who was a Freedom Caucus member during his time in the House, jumped into the race this month, warning that Republicans have lost their way.\n\n\u201cThe thing that has been lacking in this debate has been an earnest and real conversation on debt and deficits and government spending, and I find it astounding to watch the number of Democratic debates that I\u2019ve seen and no mention, no conversation on where we\u2019re going with regard to debt,\u201d he said on Fox News this month.\n\nSeveral others, including Rep. Justin Amash and Joe Walsh, have also considered running against the president.\n\nMr. Biggs cautioned against trusting the \u201canti-Trump\u201d polling data, arguing they should focus on counting electoral votes rather than generic voters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of what we were hearing last time in 2016 and it just didn\u2019t materialize,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the House, Mr. Biggs said he\u2019s confident Republicans will win control back in 2020. He said Democrats\u2019 two-dozen seat majority is built on districts they won by a combined 95,000 votes last year.\n\nGenerally, Republicans\u2019 plan is to zero in on 31 districts that the president won in 2016, 13 of which were held by more than 6 percentage points.\n\nThey\u2019re hoping the president\u2019s popularity will help reverse the 2018 blue wave and help them secure the 19 seats they need to win the majority.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
