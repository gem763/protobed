But, I will as soon as I can.\u201d\n\nAccording to MLB Network\u2019s Hazel Mae, Apstein was sitting at the press conference.\n\nWASHINGTON NATIONALS SUPERFAN HOPES TO 'BRING SOME GOOD MOJO' TO TEAM WITH INCREDIBLE BEARD DESIGN\n\nApstein and Sports Illustrated were put on blast by the Astros organization almost immediately after the report surfaced that Taubman profanely bragged about Houston closer Roberto Osuna, who was accused but never charged with domestic abuse during his tenure as a Toronto Blue Jay. He was never arrested but served a lengthy suspension. The team's first reaction was to call the Sports Illustrated report \u201cmisleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe story posted by Sports Illustrated is misleading and completely irresponsible,\" the statement said. \"An Astros player was being asked questions about a difficult outing. Our executive was supporting the player during a difficult time. His comments had everything to do about the game situation that just occurred and nothing else\u2014they were also not directed toward any specific reporters. We are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustrated\u2019s attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.\u201d\n\nLuhnow also addressed the statement, saying \u201cmany people\u201d reviewed the release.\n\n\u201cThat original reaction by the Astros was wrong, and we own it as an organization,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were many people involved in reviewing that and approving that, and I\u2019m not going to get into the details of that. It was wrong. It was the Astros\u2019 decision.\u201d\n\nIn the statement announcing the dismissal of Taubman, the Astros apologized to Apstein and Sports Illustrated.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\u201cOur initial investigation led us to believe that Brandon Taubman\u2019s inappropriate comments were not directed toward any reporter. We were wrong. We sincerely apology to Stephanie Apstein, Sports Illustrated and to all the individuals who witnessed the incident or were offended by the inappropriate conduct. The Astros in no way intended to minimize the issues related to domestic violence.\u201d", "description": "Houston Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow admitted Thursday he did not personally apologize to a Sports Illustrated writer for her report about a recently fired official who was seen taunting a group of female journalists by bragging about a player accused of a domestic assault.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
