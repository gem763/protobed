(Erin Morgan)\n\nIt\u2019s been a tradition at the Siesta Key Oyster Bar for years: Customers staple a dollar bill or two onto the wall for a laugh, and to help decorate the neighborhood bar in Sarasota, Fla.\n\nBut for the past month, dozens of employees have been gingerly peeling the money from the walls and ceiling for a purpose \u2014 to donate to Hurricane Dorian relief in the Bahamas.\n\nGeneral manager Kristin Hale brought the wads of cash to a bank Tuesday, and it totaled $13,961. She said restaurant employees have worked diligently for the past month to dislodge the bills without tearing them in an effort to help the Bahamas, which was devastated by the Category 5 hurricane last month, leaving more than 50 people dead.\n\n\u201cThe videos came out and we all saw how horrific things are there,\u201d Hale said. \u201cWhat happened to those people is unbelievable. It gives you the chills.\u201d\n\n\n\nTwo Haitian migrants amid the ruins of a home destroyed by Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas on Sept. 28.

Customers borrow the gun from the host stand and attach the bills themselves, often after writing a quick note on them.\n\nCustomers have been stapling bills to the walls of the bar since it opened 16 years ago, Hale said. Employees tell customers it\u2019s part of an old fisherman\u2019s tradition in which the seamen would visit a bar on their way out to the sea in the morning, and staple a dollar to the wall to be sure they had money for a drink in the afternoon.\n\nIs it true? \u201cIt\u2019s a fun story,\u201d Hale said.\n\n[This woman took 97 rescue dogs into her Bahamas home to protect them from Hurricane Dorian]\n\nEvery two or three years, the owners peel the bills off the walls and donate a few thousand dollars to local charities, often ones that benefit causes for children and women, Hale said.\n\nIt was the bar\u2019s owners \u2014 sisters Jill Pedigo and Beth Owen-Cipielewski and their husbands \u2014 who decided that this time, the money would go to the Red Cross for Hurricane Dorian relief.\n\n\n\nSarah Rodriguez, a server at Siesta Key Oyster bar, and other employees ease money off the walls of the bar in Sarasota, Fla. (Samantha Lemmer)\n\n\u201cThe owners are huge into giving back,\u201d Hale said. \u201cThey donate to charities every couple years. This year there was this buzz like we should donate to the Bahamas. We were all on the same page.\u201d\n\nWhen customers saw what employees were doing in the past few weeks, they started donating extra money to the cause, Hale said. And sometimes, employees found $20 bills on the walls. In recent years, the bar has donated $7,000 or $8,000 to different causes. But still, Hale said she and the other employees were blown away when they peeled almost $14,000 off the walls.\n\n\n\nBills affixed to the walls and ceiling at Siesta Key Oyster bar in Sarasota, Fla.
