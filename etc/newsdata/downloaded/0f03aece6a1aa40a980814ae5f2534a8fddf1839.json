Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), have asked the Trump administration for a \"full exemption\" from the 2001 Roadless Rule, which limits road construction and timber harvests. They argue that the protections are stifling the local economy.\n\n\"We have to be able to have a plan that is specific to us,\" Murkowski told Alaska Public Radio in August, explaining that she spoke with the Trump administration early on about addressing the Roadless Rule.\n\nBut conservation groups say that removing protections would hurt the region's fishing and tourism industries, while also worsening the effects of climate change.\n\nThe Tongass National Forest is the largest intact temperate rainforest in North America. Temperate rainforests sequester huge amounts of carbon dioxide, keeping the climate-warming gas out of the atmosphere.\n\n\"By seeking to weaken the Roadless Rule's protections, the Forest Service is prioritizing one forest use \u2014 harmful logging \u2014 over mitigating climate change, protecting wildlife habitat, and offering unmatched sight-seeing and recreation opportunities found only in southeast Alaska,\" said Josh Hicks of The Wilderness Society in a statement.\n\nThe Forest Service's proposal outlines six potential paths forward for the Tongass National Forest, ranging from doing nothing to removing protections for all of the forests 9.2 million acres of roadless area.\n\nThe agency says it prefers the latter, more extreme option. It would convert 165,000 acres of old-growth forest and 20,000 acres of young-growth that had been \"previously identified as unsuitable timber lands to suitable timber lands.\"\n\nA formal notice is expected to be published in the Federal Register later this week.\n\nThe Forest Service says it will hold a series of public meetings on the proposal and open it to public comment through Dec. 17.", "description": "The U.S. Forest Service is proposing to end a nearly two-decade long limit on logging in Alaska's Tongass National Forest.
