REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nDraghi pushed through a decision to resume the ECB\u2019s 2.6 trillion-euro bond-buying programme last month, despite opposition from more than a third of the 25 members of the Governing Council.\n\nHis departure on Oct. 31 gives this growing legion of sceptics from countries such as Germany, France and the Netherlands hope of shifting the balance of power at the top of the ECB under its new president, Christine Lagarde.\n\nHerself a Frenchwoman, Lagarde will work with a largely new Executive Board, the six-person team who prepares Governing Council meetings and puts monetary policy into practice.\n\nAll the main supporters of Draghi\u2019s first stimulus package have left or will soon leave the board. Key portfolios, including that of overseeing the bond-buying programme, are up for grabs.\n\n\u201cThe dynamic will be quite different and the ECB will become a much more difficult institution to read and understand,\u201d said David Owen, chief European economist at Jefferies.\n\nThe first big test is likely to come next year, when the ECB nears a limit on owning more than a third of Germany\u2019s outstanding debt under its quantitative-easing programme (QE).\n\nFor most of his mandate, Draghi could count on his deputy, Vitor Constancio, and chief economist, Peter Praet, to support him internally and explain his dovish message to investors. Most of the Governing Council took its cue from an authoritative trio of economists at the top.\n\nBut come Nov. 1, Philip Lane will be the only trained economist on the board who backed the new bond purchases at the last policy meeting.\n\nLagarde, a politician like her deputy Luis de Guindos, has struck a balanced tone, saying accommodative policy was necessary but also that it had side effects that needed monitoring.\n\nThis creates room for sceptics of QE to be heard, particularly if Germany picks a heavyweight economist to replace Sabine Lautenschlaeger, the banking supervisor who unexpectedly quit last week.\n\nGerman academic Isabel Schnabel, Bundesbank vice-president Claudia Buch and former ECB economist Marcel Fratzscher are among those who might take Lautenschlaeger\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cIn this phase, Germany needs someone who can speak and argue with some authority on monetary policy,\u201d said Alessandro Merli, a fellow at SAIS Europe Johns Hopkins University. \u201cTherefore, Lautenschlaeger was not of much use in the Executive Board.\u201d\n\nEuro zone ministers begin selecting Lautenschlaeger\u2019s successor next week and want to have a new board member in place by January. The tight deadline suggests Berlin may already have someone in mind.\n\nThe often-overlooked distribution of portfolios among board members is likely to be key, in particular those held by Benoit Coeure as head of the ECB\u2019s market operations and representative at international fora.\n\nThe only candidate to replace Coeure on Jan. 1 is Italy\u2019s Fabio Panetta, who rarely voiced an opinion on monetary policy and last represented his country on the ECB\u2019s banking supervision arm.\n\nBoard members are supposed to have the good of the euro zone as a whole in mind, but they are put forward by their national governments and their views are sometime tinged by national interests, such as favouring bond purchases and low interest rates where the government is more indebted.\n\n\u201cPanetta can be expected to take a typically dovish Italian viewpoint, thus supporting open-ended asset purchases for as long as core inflation is expected to remain sub-target,\u201d Daiwa\u2019s economists said in a note to clients.\n\nBut Germany is also likely to stake a claim on Coeure\u2019s portfolios, and Lagarde could split or combine responsibilities among board members as she pleases.\n\nThat could prove crucial when the new president follows through on her promise to review the ECB\u2019s policy strategy and tools. Such a wide-reaching undertaking could even see the bank redefine its inflation target, now less than but close to 2%.\n\n\u201cLagarde could face some pressure to reallocate part of the responsibilities to more hawkish members, including when it comes to reshaping monetary policy in the upcoming strategy review,\u201d Frederik Ducrozet, a strategist at Pictet Wealth Management, said.", "description": "Mario Draghi leaves the European Central Bank at the end of the month, and that may give opponents of his ultra-easy monetary policy a chance to shift the tone of the debate at the top of the institution.", "authors": ["Francesco Canepa", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435819712&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902BF", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
