Then Fleck whips another low cross in from the left than Van Dijk clears yet again. He is holding the back four together at the moment, both full-backs have been well below their usual standard.\n\n1:37PM\n\n49 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nEgan has been so dominant on crosses, heading everything that moves. Looks like a big tactical switch from Jurgen Klopp: Fabinho has dropped into back three, with Robertson and Alexander-Arnold swapping sides at wing-back. Aaaaaaannnnd, now they have switched back again. Maybe they just found themselves there for a few minutes. One to keep an eye on.\n\n1:34PM\n\n47 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nLiverpool straight on to the front foot and Fabinho unleashes a fierce volley from distance that is well blocked. Down the other end, Fleck drives past Henderson and into the penalty area. Robinson was free for a tap in but Van Dijk did well to get himself in line with ball and man to cut it out.\n\n1:32PM\n\nWe're back under way\n\nSheffield United get us going in the second-half.\n\n1:32PM\n\nPlayers back out\n\nLooks like Liverpool were out there early, with a Klopp rocket in their ear one imagines.\n\n1:30PM\n\nTurtleneck a staple of your recently retired footballer's wardrobe\n\nJoe Cole looking like he\u2019s about to launch the iPhone 12 #SHULIVpic.twitter.com/Lpp3s5bcjy \u2014 Daniel Wall (@DanielWall__) September 28, 2019\n\n1:23PM\n\nStory of the first half\n\nStory continues\n\nSheffield United finding space in behind Alexander-Arnold. Robinson has drifted over there quite a bit and whipped some good crosses in.\n\nThe technical level of United's midfield has surprised me. Norwood, Fleck and Lundstram have passed cleanly and forward bar than one Fleck mistake before Mane's chance.\n\nLiverpool are up against six central bodies - the three centre backs and the three central midfielders, so it's been difficult to feed passes into Mane, Salah and Firmino. All have tried to move wide at times, but been closed out.\n\n1:17PM\n\nHT: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nWell played Sheffield United, and the home fans rightly give them the ovation they deserve. Liverpool should be ahead though after those two Mane chances.\n\n1:16PM\n\n45 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nNice play from the home side again, Robinson finding more space behind TAA, picks out Lundstram at the back post who heads across goal. McBurnie looks like nodding it home but Matip just about gets underneath him to head away from danger.\n\n1:14PM\n\n43 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nNorwood and Lundstram work the ball out to the right flank and the cross is deflected behind. McBurnie was shouting for a corner, but Taylor gives the goal kick.\n\nLiverpool go really deep to play out, Matip and Van Dijk dropping to their six yard line. Might be something in that, to try and drag United's defenders a bit higher up the pitch. Or if they don't move up, open space between the lines.\n\nThere's a mistake by Fleck though, a mis-placed square pass and Liverpool are away four on three! Salah squares it to Firmino who finds Mane in the left channel as the extra man, bearing dow on Henderson but his shot strikes the foot of the near post. Breaks to Firmino but his follow up is blocked. Should be 0-1.\n\n1:10PM\n\n41 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nLiverpool yet to have a shot on target after nearly 40 minutes of a Premier League match, testament to United's good work and thoughtful strategy.\n\nEgan and his central defensive partners have been fantastic so far. Robertson gets in on the overlap but another clumsy moment as he clumps a ball out for a goal kick.\n\n1:08PM\n\n38 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nHalf a chance for United...Stephens whips in a left-footed cross that finds Robinson in between the Liverpool centre-backs but he mis-times his leap and the attempted effort comes off his shoulder.\n\nLiverpool go on the attack but Wijnaldum's shot from 25 yards or so is dreadful. Way over the bar.\n\n1:06PM\n\n37 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nThis is better, Henderson clips a ball behind the defence and Salah hows fantastic agility to spin O'Connell but United just about recovered to close the door and force him wide.\n\n1:04PM\n\n35 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nJust as I say that....Liverpool release Mane with a long ball over the top from Van Dijk. Brings it down well, clean through with view of the whites of Henderson's eyes but the shot skewed off the outside of his foot and ballooned over. Liverpool's best moment.\n\n1:03PM\n\n33 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nThe balls runs away from Robertson, just another small piece of sloppiness that has pock-marked Liverpool's performance thus far. The way this going, it make take a set-piece for them to find a breakthrough. They rarely look so ineffective in open play.\n\n1:01PM\n\n30 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nLiverpool took a while to break down Arsenal's diamond at Anfield, and with two up front and a tight midfield three blocking avenues to Salah, Firmino and Mane this is a similar task. The difference is United have five across the back which means they are far closer to press Liverpool's full-backs than Arsenal were. Working a treat so far. Salah getting frustrated, but he wins a foul from Stephens.\n\n12:58PM\n\n27 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nLiverpool's centre-backs seeing so much of the ball, but progressing it has been far more difficult. Chris Wilder has done a good job during the week preparing Sheffield United for this, their approach has been spot on. Salah finds half a yard but his scuffed attempt from the edge of the box is wide.\n\nDown the other end, Robinson's clipped cross from the left looks destined for McBurnie's head but Van Dijk wins a crucial header at the back stick. Would have been a goal. The home crowd roar as an aimless Liverpool ball sees the hosts regain possession and get back on the front foot.\n\n12:54PM\n\n24 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nLiverpool finding it difficult to zip balls into the feet of the front three, and when they do their flicks and first time wall passes are not finding their targets.\n\nFirmino drifts towards the left to successfully find some space and Liverpool switch the point of the attack to Alexander-Arnold but his heavy cross flies comfortably over.\n\n12:52PM\n\n22 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nBeautifully worked move by the hosts, Fleck feeds a cute pass in behind Liverpool's midfield and they work it to Robinson in the right channel against Van Dijk. Takes the shot early, and it flashes past the far post. Replays show is was several feet wide, but plenty of power behind it.\n\n12:50PM\n\n20 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nSheffield United back in their 5-3-2 defensive shape. Matip tries to swing a spectacular long pass forward for Mane but it is just too strong and skips out for a goal kick. Mane is then penalised for a high boot on halfway.\n\n12:47PM\n\n17 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nThat was a bit more like it from Liverpool, superb pass through the lines from Matip and Firmino tries to work his magic around the edge of the area but the flick does not quite drop for anyone. Wijnaldum has a snap shot from distance that deflects wide but the corner comes to nothing.\n\nSheffield United targeting Liverpool\u2019s right side often. Clear they\u2019ve identified Alexander Arnold as a weakness. \u2014 Tim Stillman (@Stillberto) September 28, 2019\n\n12:45PM\n\n15 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nIt is almost three-on-three between the United centre-backs and Liverpool's front three which you would think is a perilous state of affairs , but the Lundstram, Norwood and Fleck are doing a good job of staying narrow in midfield and blocking passing lanes.\n\n12:43PM\n\n12 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nAfter than early squall of Liverpool pressure, Sheffield United are looking pretty comfortable and win their first corner of the game. From the right, they try and pick out Baldock at the back post but he gets underneath it.\n\n12:40PM\n\n10 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nFirmino finds a pocket of space to feed Salah inside the box but nobody read the backheel.\n\nTerrible giveaway on halfway from Alexander-Anrold enables Robinson to launch a counter, running straight at the two centre-backs who do enough to slow the move down. He spreads play to Basham on the right but his cross is dealt with.\n\n12:38PM\n\n8 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nGame has gone slightly scrappy with a few throw ins deep in Liverpool's half. Sheffield United get some joy behind Alexander-Arnold again, a simple punt over the top and McBurnie was isolated one-on-one with Matip. The defender did well to slow him up and block a tame shot. Half-hearted appeals for handball but nothing to see there.\n\n12:36PM\n\n6 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nIt is a bona fide front two from the home team, ready to run into the space behind Liverpool's advanced full-backs if they can win the ball back.\n\nEasier said than done because Matip and Van Dijk are so composed and Liverpool are stringing together moves with dozens of passes already. Sheffield Utd quite deep, but the whole unit is dropping so they remain compact.\n\n12:34PM\n\n4 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nLiverpool pressure mounting, Sheffield Utd pushed back and unable to clear their lines.\n\nBut there is their first chance to attack...Stephens springs the move with a good forward pass and Matip and van Dijk were out of sync. McBurnie latched onto the pass in the left channel, chopped inside onto his right but shoots straight at Adrian. More promising.\n\n12:32PM\n\n2 minutes: Sheffield United 0 Liverpool 0\n\nLiverpool try and turn the hosts around straight away with a long ball over the top but it skips through to Henderson. That was a feature of their approach at Burnley too, surprisingly direct.\n\nSheffield Utd trying to bring some energy and intensity to the game but Liverpool are playing through them quite comfortably at the moment.\n\n12:30PM\n\nWe're off!\n\nThe sun has come out now, with half the pitch still in shadow, but the rain is still falling. Every country has a climate, only England has weather.\n\nAnthony Taylor is our referee, and the away side get us under way as that Crispy Chip Butty song is blasted out by the Sheffield Utd fans.\n\n12:26PM\n\nTeams in the tunnel\n\nNot long to wait until the Crispy Chip Butty song rings round Bramall Lane.\n\n12:16PM\n\nA bit drizzly in south Yorkshire\n\nCredit: Reuters\n\n12:10PM\n\nDo Sheff Utd still bear a grudge?\n\nYou might remember this was Sheffield United's first fixture of the season the last time they were in the top-flight in 2006-7. Rob Hulse gave them the lead but they were denies a famous victory by a controversial penalty.\n\nCredit: PA\n\nChris Morgan slid in at the feet of Steven Gerrard, making no contact but causing Gerrard to stumble as he hurdled the challenge, and Rob Styles gave the pen. It probably was a foul, but it was (and still is) unusual to see them given when there is no contact. Neil Warnock was apoplectic.\n\n12:03PM\n\nThis is worth another look\n\nSheffield United's signature tactic are their 'overlapping centre-backs' and JJ Bull spoke to those in the know about how and why they do it.\n\nWe have seen players like Cesar Azpilicueta and Nacho Monreal stepping out of a back three to create an extra player in attack, but carrying on these runs all the way to the by-line is something different.\n\n11:59AM\n\nKlopp taking no chances\n\nThe front three all start following doubts about Mane's readiness earlier in the week, and Klopp has picked probably his tallest and most physical back six just in case Sheffield United try to test them on crosses. Matip and Van Dijk with Fabinho screening just in front of them - it will be difficult for Robinson and McBurnie to get any change from direct aerial play or second balls against those three.\n\nThat means United will need to work the ball through midfield to try and fashion chances, and that brings Liverpool's pressing traps into play. Chris Wilder's team do like to play on the deck in a fairly measured way - it will be interesting to see how they adapt today.\n\n11:49AM\n\nSheffield United team: two up top\n\nBlades boss Chris Wilder has selected the same 11 which defeated Everton at Goodison Park in the last Premier League outing.#SUFC \ufffd\ufffd \u2014 Sheffield United (@SheffieldUnited) September 28, 2019\n\n11:48AM\n\nLiverpool team: Nothing to quibble with there\n\n11:44AM\n\nAnother seamless win or potential banana skin?\n\nLiverpool can make it 16 Premier League victories in succession today, but a plucky Sheffield United team are capable of making life difficult at Bramall Lane.\n\nThe league leaders were hanging on a tad at Chelsea last week and needed a freak goal by Trent Alexander-Arnold to break the deadlock at Burnley in the previous away game so Jurgen Klopp's team are not always free-flowing on the road.\n\nThe main news this morning concerns off-field matters, with the EFL investigating whether Liverpool fielded an ineligible player in the Carabao Cup at MK Dons. They could face a fine or potentially expulsion from the competition.\n\nLiverpool chief executive Peter Moore also appeared a touch premature when he boasted of the club being 'back on their perch', a reference to Sir Alex Ferguson's comments when he arrived at Manchester United.\n\nKlopp was asked about the comment at his pre-match press conference, and admitted he was unsure what the expression implied.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat I heard is how it often is in life, without the context. We are all adults and we say things and sometimes people have to deal with things that I say and in this case people seem to think I have to deal with things Peter said.\n\n\u201cI'm not angry about him or whatever. I like Peter. So now if people come to me constantly and ask, 'are you still on the perch or not?' I still won't understand what the word perch means.\u201d\n\nSadio Mane was an injury doubt but is expected to make it, while James Milner is likely to be rested after playing at MK Dons.\n\nSheffield United have been competitive in all their games but look slightly blunt up front, and this game might be decided by how they avoid Salah and Mane isolating their wide centre-backs in their back five.", "description": "Nice play by Fleck again who tries to find McBurnie with a reverse pass, but Van Dijk read it.
