In May they valued Canva, the maker of intuitive graphic design software with 15 million active users, at $3.6 billion based on a $70 million injection from Silicon Valley's General Catalyst.\n\nCanva co-founders (and recently engaged couple) Mr Obrecht and Ms Perkins were together valued at only $177 million by the 2018 Rich List. Their dramatically higher, $1.35 billion valuation today is based on a new understanding that they, alongside technical co-founder Cameron Adams and early staff given sweat equity, have retained more than a 50 per cent ownership in Canva despite seven rounds of external funding.", "description": "Near-record highs on the ASX 200 and Nasdaq have propelled a technology wealth boom, with Australia now home to seven billionaire individuals or couples.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7122%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_405%2C$y_870/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d98c9e3e59dd1c30f7bafa50018eedfb305e97e0", "published_at": "2019-08-04"}
