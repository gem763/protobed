He said the meeting \u201cwas not a dialogue, this was sort of a diatribe, a nasty diatribe not focused on the facts\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s bizarre, threatening letter to Erdo\u011fan: \u2018Don\u2019t be a fool\u2019 Read more\n\nPelosi said: \u201cI pray for the president all the time \u2026 I think now we have to pray for his health \u2013 this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.\u201d\n\nShe added Democrats \u201ccouldn\u2019t continue in the meeting because he was just not relating to the reality of it\u201d.\n\nRepublicans pushed back, arguing it was Pelosi who\u2019d been the problem. \u201cShe storms out of another meeting, trying to make it unproductive,\u201d said the House GOP leader, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nThe White House spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, called Pelosi\u2019s action \u201cbaffling but not surprising\u201d.\n\nTrump himself pushed back in a series of tweets, calling Pelosi \u201cNervous Nancy\u201d and the Democrats the \u201cDo Nothing Democrats\u201d.\n\nDonald J.

Trump declared on Wednesday that the US had no stake in defending the Kurdish fighters, who died by the thousands as America\u2019s partners against Isis extremists.\n\nCondemnation of Trump\u2019s stance on Turkey, Syria and the Kurds was quick and severe during the day, and Pelosi said Trump appeared visibly \u201cshaken up\u201d after nearly two-thirds of the House GOP caucus voted in support of the resolution.\n\nThe non-binding resolution states Congress\u2019s opposition to the troop pullback and says Turkey should cease its military action in Syria. The measure also says the White House should present a plan for an \u201cenduring defeat\u201d of the Islamic State; many worry that Isis will resurge as Turkish forces attack Syrian Kurds who are holding the extremists.\n\nThe Syria briefing marked the first face-to-face interaction between Trump and Pelosi since the House speaker formally launched an impeachment inquiry against the president last month.\n\nTrump himself has stalked out of his White House meetings in the past, including with congressional leaders in May, when he said he would no longer work with Democrats unless they dropped all Russia investigations, and last January during the partial government shutdown.\n\nIn public appearances on Wednesday, Trump said he was fulfilling a campaign pledge to bring US troops home from \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East \u2013 casting aside criticism that a sudden US withdrawal from Syria betrays the Kurdish fighters, stains US credibility around the world, and opens an important region to Russia, which is moving in.\n\n\u201cWe have a situation where Turkey is taking land from Syria. Syria\u2019s not happy about it. Let them work it out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey have a problem at a border. It\u2019s not our border. We shouldn\u2019t be losing lives over it.\u201d", "description": "President launches Twitter tirade after Democratic leaders exited meeting they say devolved into insults", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc6b4d60a4c914b9ec69e5ac51c366fd9c42dcde/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2a63666d52a4ac4b52372cf61fad6cd2", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
