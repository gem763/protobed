But it wasn\u2019t long before Mr. Trump came under withering criticism from Republicans who complained that he was enriching one of his businesses in open violation of the U.S. Constitution by promoting his exclusive golf club among the elite leaders of the world.\n\nLess than a week after the president announced his decision to hold the G-7 meeting at Doral, he was caving under an avalanche of complaints, led by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\nHe had been warned by White House advisers that the idea of using his business to host G-7 leaders \u201cwould not play well\u201d on Capitol Hill, but Mr. Trump rejected that advice.\n\nClose advisers told him that he would be in violation of Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause that says \u201cno person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept any present, Emolument, Office or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince or foreign State.\u201d\n\nThe Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act of 1966 also \u201cenumerates several elected positions in its definition of employees \u201cwho may not accept any gift of more than minimal value without congressional approval. Such \u201cemployees\u201d include the President and Vice President, a member of Congress, and the spouses and dependents of the same,\u201d according to the Legal Information Institute.\n\nStunned by a wave of criticism, Mr. Trump backed down, after it had become clear that his move \u201chad alienated Republicans and swiftly became part of the impeachment inquiry that threatens his presidency.\u201d\n\nThen there was the sweeping announcement last December when Mr. Trump said he was bringing home all of what were then over 2,000 troops in Syria.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before he pulled back from that decision in the face of strong political criticism at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cUltimately, about half of the force was withdrawn. His announcement early this month that all 1,000 remaining troops were leaving cleared the way for a Turkish military offensive in northeastern Syria and led to charges he was abandoning Syrian Kurdish allies and capitulating to Turkey. The Kurdish forces have suffered thousands of casualties while helping beat back the Islamist State,\u201d The Washington Post reported this week.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision was partially pulled back, deciding last week \u201cto keep some troops in Syria after ordering a complete withdrawal,\u201d The Post said.\n\nHis pull-out decision didn\u2019t anticipate Turkey\u2019s response, nor did it think through that it left Middle East oil fields exposed to ISIS takeover.\n\n\u201cIt would be highly embarrassing for the U.S. for ISIS to start up oil operations again,\u201d said David Butter, associate fellow in Middle East studies at Chatham House.\n\nAll of this is going on while the House continues holding its impeachment proceedings that includes testimony from witnesses that Mr. Trump withheld critically important security assistance from the Ukraine government after asking them to dig up damaging information on one of his rivals in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThis information came this week in testimony from our acting U.S. Ambassador William B. Taylor for Ukraine.\n\nIn his opening testimony, Mr. Taylor said \u201c\u2026 in August and September of this year, I became increasingly concerned that our relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons.\u201d\n\nMr. Taylor told the bipartisan House impeachment panel that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, \u201ctold me that President Trump had told him that he wants [Ukrainian] President Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate\u201d Joe Biden and his son who got a high paying job with a Ukrainian energy company.\n\n\u201cHe said that President Trump wanted President Zelensky \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations,\u201d Mr. Taylor testified under oath.\n\nStay tuned.\n\n\u2022 Donald Lambro is a syndicated columnist and contributor to The Washington Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
