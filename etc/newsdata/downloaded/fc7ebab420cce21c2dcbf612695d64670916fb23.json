The changes we saw over the summer have resulted in a very young squad. But it\u2019s also a squad, with the players and the culture, that provides a base camp for us to build and grow from as we start our new journey.\u2019\n\nA frequent criticism of Woodward during his six-year spell as the club\u2019s CEO has been that he has prioritized commercial success to on-field matters by securing a number of lucrative sponsorship deals while the team has struggled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe denied that is the case, though, saying: \u2018The reality of Manchester United is we are a club in two parts.\n\n\u2018First of all, we are an incredible 141-year footballing institution with all that history, all that legacy, all that tradition and that tradition of success. That can never, ever change. We need to keep that protected.\n\n\u2018Then, like other football clubs, our commercial business allows us to reinvest in the football side. It\u2019s how these two interact with each other at Manchester United that results in us having a competitive advantage in this area.\n\n\u2018What\u2019s important is the commercial side is never allowed to take priority over the football side.\u2019", "description": "Ed Woodward has offered a defiant backing to his under-pressure manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer despite Manchester United's miserable start to the season.
