For a modern film business that scrupulously avoids controversy \u2014 shunning ideological content in its scripts and coaching stars to avoid politics in interviews \u2014 the movie has become the most unusual of modern products: a lightning rod produced by a major studio.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been so much controversy around it that I don\u2019t think anyone really knows what to expect,\u201d said Bruce Nash, a movie-release expert from the box office site the Numbers.\n\nThat includes Warner Bros., which has been desperately trying to avoid headlines on the movie when news coverage typically is a sought-after commodity. Executives have been tasked with steering the release of the film to a country seething with anger and reeling from mass shootings.\n\nA rare movie that makes a villain the hero, \u201cJoker\u201d centers on Arthur Fleck, a failed clown and standup comic with a neurological deficit who turns to mass murder after being marginalized. He eventually becomes the Joker, folk hero to an angry populist mob.\n\nAD\n\nHow 'Joker' became one of the most divisive movies of the year\n\nThe politically charged backlash began even before the film debuted at the Venice Film Festival, where it landed one of the film world\u2019s top honors, the Golden Lion prize. Time magazine\u2019s Stephanie Zacharek was among several critics questioning the movie\u2019s message.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn America, there\u2019s a mass shooting or attempted act of violence by a guy like Arthur practically every other week,\u201d she wrote during the festival. \u201cAnd yet we\u2019re supposed to feel some sympathy for [him].\u201d\n\nShe also said the character could \u201ceasily be adopted as the patron saint of incels,\u201d referring to a group of disaffected white males who describe themselves as involuntarily celibate.\n\nAD\n\nOther journalists worried \u201cJoker\u201d could serve as inspiration to people contemplating violence.\n\n\u201cThe film is also deeply disturbing and, I fear, could incite real-world problems. Gun violence, mental illness and random senseless killings don\u2019t play like they used to at the movies,\u201d wrote the Hollywood Reporter columnist Scott Feinberg. The sentiment prompted Claudia Eller, editor in chief of rival publication Variety, to say: \u201cTotally agree with you.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the past week, the fears about real-world violence have been echoed by those who\u2019ve suffered its consequences. Members of five families affected by the mass shooting at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater in July 2012 \u2014 at another Batman-themed film, \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d \u2014 spoke out against \u201cJoker\u201d and encouraged the studio to atone for its sins by supporting gun-control laws.\n\nAD\n\nThe five family members \u2014 including two who lost children \u2014 wrote a letter to Warner Bros. chief executive Ann Sarnoff saying the sympathetic depiction of a mass-murderer \u201cgave us pause.\u201d The family members asked the studio to use its \u201cmassive platform and influence to join us in our fight to build safer communities with fewer guns.\u201d\n\nThe letter prompted the studio to take the highly unusual step of interpreting the film for its audience. \u201cMake no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero,\u201d Warner Bros. said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nStill, the company said the film would not play in the Aurora theater, which is part of Cinemark, the country\u2019s third-largest chain. A Warner Bros. spokesman declined to comment further for this piece.\n\nAD\n\nElsewhere, the studio has sought to elevate security levels. Warner Bros. has worked with law enforcement in New York City, where the Gotham-based movie is subtextually set. Uniformed and undercover police officers will be dispatched to screenings in the city to deter any incidents.\n\nTheater chains have been treading carefully, too. \u201cParental warning (this is not a joke),\u201d a representative for the 40-theater upscale Alamo Drafthouse chain wrote on Facebook, citing \u201cvery, very rough language, brutal violence, and overall bad vibes.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not for kids, and they won\u2019t like it, anyway,\u201d the post said. The boutique chain Landmark, meanwhile, has banned masks at screenings.\n\nAD\n\nThe film will open on some 4,300 screens this weekend, and tracking has been strong. The prerelease surveys suggest an opening total of $90 million, or possibly as much as $100 million. If that happens, \u201cJoker\u201d will make history; only three R-rated films have hit that mark.\n\nAD\n\nWarner Bros. has tried to walk a line few studios have been forced to walk during Oscar season, the period of overheated movie publicity that begins in September and stretches into the winter. A splashy party at Toronto was followed by a low-key premiere in Los Angeles last weekend at which no print journalists were allowed on the red carpet. The studio has also been judicious about its stars\u2019 media appearances, balancing the need for promotion with the fears of more hot water.\n\nBut events often seemed to overtake the studio.\n\nAD\n\nIn a mostly unrelated Phoenix profile in Vanity Fair earlier this week, director Todd Phillips, asked to give some ancillary quotes, noted the film came about because he was angry about the direction of liberal Hollywood.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGo try to be funny nowadays with this woke culture,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cSo you just go, \u2018I\u2019m out.\u2019\u2026 So I go, \u2018How do I do something irreverent, but [forget] comedy?\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, co-star Robert De Niro, who plays a talk-show host and object of the Joker\u2019s obsession, appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources\u201d and dismissed defenders of President Trump with a four-letter epithet, adding gasoline to the fire.\n\nPolitics could actually drum up business for the film. Though some people at the Toronto event, including a few affiliated with the film, privately said they saw the film\u2019s angry populists as Trump voters, Hollywood marketing insiders said the movie could also easily play across the aisle.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople are angry and feel powerless,\u201d said a longtime studio marketing executive not involved with the film who spoke on the condition anonymity because his company did not authorize him to talk to the press. \u201cThis is a movie about a beloved angry character who finds his power.\u201d\n\nThe tracking, he said, suggests Warner Bros. may be making a mistake trying to tamp down the negative attention. \u201cThe controversies and pearl-clutching are only supercharging it,\u201d he said.\n\nSome experts worry the controversies \u2014 particularly over the potential incitement of violence \u2014 could distract from more important issues raised by the film.\n\n\u201cAll the talk about whether it causes violence takes away the real opportunity we have here: to use the movie for a dialogue about questions like alienation, toxic masculinity and the fragility of whiteness,\u201d said Kendall Phillips, a professor at Syracuse University who studies how works of popular culture affect social tensions.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese are questions we have a hard time talking about after a mass shooting because both sides get so entrenched politically. A movie allows us to talk about these issues \u2014 if we allow it to.\u201d\n\nAsked by The Washington Post if he was worried the film could become a model for those with violence on their minds, director Todd Phillips, best known for the Hangover movies, had an unusual answer. He didn\u2019t say it couldn\u2019t \u2014 just that the medium of film is meant to be potent.\n\n\u201cArt isn\u2019t safe,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want a safe art form, take up calligraphy.\u201d", "description": "\"Joker\" opens on some 4,300 screens this weekend.
