Superman. \u201cIt\u2019s a cool point of view to be like \u2018my heroes are still innocent\u2026 My heroes didn\u2019t commit any atrocities.\u2019 That\u2019s cool. But you\u2019re living in a fucking dream world,\u201d he said, in a profanity-filled rant captured on video and posted on Reddit. Bat-fans reacted predictably on social media, insisting that Batman shouldn\u2019t kill, and that Snyder\u2019s dark vision is a betrayal of the character.\n\nTo which I say: a pox on both your Batcaves. The entire argument about Batman killing people is ridiculous, and people should stop obsessing over it. Superhero movies take a fundamentally unserious, dumb stance on what violence looks like and what it means, regardless of whether superheroes actually choose to kill people. Batman isn\u2019t a more moral character if he declares his actions don\u2019t kill people, and he isn\u2019t a more grown-up one if he does.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t want their superheroes to kill are arguing that characters cross an absolute moral line when they murder people, and that heroes are meant to be aspirational and make better moral choices than most people. But the actions those heroes engage in constantly belie the \u201cno killing\u201d rule. Are heroes who regularly punch people through walls, or hit them in the face hard enough to knock them unconscious, actually showing any sort of absolute commitment to the sanctity of life?\n\nSuperhero codes against killing rely on the fantasy that heroes can subject their enemies to massive violence and somehow assure that no one dies, just because they\u2019ve declared that they aren\u2019t killers. In Netflix\u2019s now-canceled Daredevil series, the main character regularly tortures people, but none of his victims ever suffer a heart attack. Superman can pulverize concrete with his bare hands, but somehow when he hits the bad guy, he doesn\u2019t fracture every bone in their bodies.\n\nSuperhero comics declare that the stated intent not to kill is important, even for people who are entirely cavalier about applying lethal force. But in real-life law enforcement, supposedly non-lethal methods of restraint like Tasers can actually result in more deaths, because police deploy them casually in instances where they wouldn\u2019t shoot their guns. As a practical matter, it\u2019s often more dangerous to say, \u201cOur methods aren\u2019t expressly intended to kill, so they aren\u2019t dangerous\u201d while using violence than it is to consciously, judiciously deploy lethal force. The body count for declared non-killer Batman, who regularly leaves people lying around unconscious, presumably with concussions, skull fractures, and brain bleeds, would very likely be higher than that for killer Batman, if either one lived in the real world.\n\nSo does that mean Snyder is right to boast about the realism of his murdering Batman? Of course not.\n\nSnyder claims that when he says Batman is a conscious killer, he\u2019s critiquing fan naivet\u00e9 and exposing the gritty underbelly of heroism. But it\u2019s not like heroes who kill are some kind of daring innovation. James Bond has been murdering bad guys for more than 60 years now; Clint Eastwood\u2019s half-century-long filmography is packed with proudly murderous vigilantes. Killer Batman isn\u2019t an insightful commentary on our heroes. He\u2019s just yet another reminder that people like the tidiness and catharsis of seeing heroes kill bad guys on film.\n\nSnyder\u2019s use of lethal violence in Batman v. Superman is indistinguishable from that in, say, 2018\u2019s Skyscraper, in which Dwayne Johnson\u2019s veteran character kills a bunch of terrorists while trying to protect his family. Skyscraper, needless to say, is not a hard-hitting expos\u00e9 of our cultural naivet\u00e9. It\u2019s a big dumb action movie with lots of explosions, and a casual hand at disposing of characters it\u2019s done with.\n\nThis isn\u2019t meant to forestall critiques of the ways violence is used in action stories. Daredevil\u2019s advocacy of torture is disturbing; the glorification of gun violence in Netflix\u2019s The Punisher is ugly. The way superhero films and action movies generally present violence as the first, last, and only solution to injustice is obviously limiting, and there\u2019s plenty to discuss in the way that obsession with simple violence and killing off evil reflects America\u2019s obsession with guns, lethal force, and simple fantasy solutions to complicated social problems.\n\nBut the bottom line is that it\u2019s impossible to square the escapist fantasy of vigilantes doling out lethal force in cool action sequences with any kind of thoughtful take on violence and morality, regardless of whether you acknowledge that the lethal force actually kills people. People who want nuanced discussions of violence and law enforcement probably shouldn\u2019t be watching blockbuster fantasies where heroes punch and shoot evil out of the world. For people who don\u2019t care about the real moral issues of violence, gun control, and abusive policing, it\u2019s ridiculous to quibble over whether a given Batman throat-punch happened to result in a death. The entire debate is mashing up fantasy action with real-world consequences in a way that muddies both.", "description": "Watchmen and Man of Steel director Zack Snyder was back in the news this week, defending his decision to have Batman kill people in Batman v.
