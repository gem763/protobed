Those laws are intended to prevent doctors from referring patients for services that would financially benefit them, or taking bribes to generate new business.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the administration argues those rules can sometimes have unintended consequences by blocking some legitimate payment arrangements as well.\n\nThe very technical changes in the new proposed rules would create exceptions that allow for \u201cvalue-based\u201d payment arrangements, which is where doctors get paid more if their patients get better results. Officials say there would still be rules against actual fraud.\n\nThose new payment arrangements are viewed by members of both parties as an important step in modernizing the health system and saving money in the long term by taking away incentives for doctors to simply order many tests and procedures because they get paid for each one.\n\nMore broadly, the Trump administration is also trying to continue a drumbeat of health care announcements as it seeks to show progress on an issue that Democrats used to great political advantage in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\n\u201cRegulatory reform has been a key piece of President Trump Donald John TrumpPelosi hits back at Trump over letter: 'Only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy' Trump directed Perry, State Dept. officials to talk to Giuliani on Ukraine: report Murkowski warns against rushing to conclusions on Trump impeachment MORE\u2019s agenda not just for faster innovation and economic growth, but also better, higher-value healthcare,\u201d said Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar. \u201cOur proposed rules would be an unprecedented opportunity for providers to work together to deliver the kind of high-value, coordinated care that patients deserve.\u201d", "description": "The Trump administration on Wednesday announced proposed changes to ease regulations targeting fraud by doctors in what it says is an effort to remove barriers to some legitimate innovative payment arrangements.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/chipdoctor_091517getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
