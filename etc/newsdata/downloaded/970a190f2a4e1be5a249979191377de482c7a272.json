It tells the story of a teen and her friends trying to help a young Yeti reunite with its family as a wealthy man seeks to capture it as a prize.\n\nIn third, at $8 million, was Focus Features' \"Downton Abbey,\" the cinematic follow-up to the hit TV series about an upper-class family and their stately home in a changing Britain. The movie has the Crawleys and their earnest staff scrambling to prepare for an unexpected visit by the British royals.\n\n\"Hustlers\" from STX Films placed fourth, at $6.3 million. The Jennifer Lopez movie is based on a true story about strippers who plot to steal from their wealthy clients in recession-hit New York.\n\nAnd in fifth was horror film \"IT: Chapter Two,\" at $5.4 million. The Warner Bros. movie features the grown-up versions of the kids who battled the terrifying clown Pennywise 27 years earlier as they are forced do it again.\n\nRounding out the weekend's top 10 were:\n\n\"Ad Astra\" ($4.6 million)\n\n\"Judy\" ($4.4 million)\n\n\"Rambo: Last Blood\" ($3.6 million)\n\n\"War\" ($1.6 million)\n\n\"Good Boys\" ($900,000)", "description": "Warner Bros.' \"Joker\" has survived the intense controversy over its violent themes to take in an estimated $93.5 million in North American theaters this weekend, setting a record for an October release, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations reported Sunday.
