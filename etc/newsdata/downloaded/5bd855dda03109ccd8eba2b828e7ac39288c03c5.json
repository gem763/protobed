(Erin Schaff/The New York Times)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 After oil installations were blown up in Saudi Arabia over the weekend, President Donald Trump declared that the United States was \u201clocked and loaded,\u201d a phrase that seemed to suggest he was ready to strike back. But then he promised to wait for Saudi Arabia to tell him \u201cunder what terms we would proceed.\u201d\n\nHis message on Twitter offered a remarkable insight into the deference Trump gives to the Saudi royal family and touched off a torrent of criticism from those who have long accused him of doing Riyadh\u2019s bidding while sweeping Saudi violations of human rights and international norms under the rug.\n\nIt was hard to imagine him allowing NATO, or a European ally, such latitude to determine how the United States should respond. But for Trump, the Saudis have always been a special case, their economic import having often overwhelmed other considerations in his mind.\n\nWhether, and how, to commit U.S. forces is one of the most critical decisions any U.S. president can make, but Trump\u2019s comment gave the impression that he was outsourcing the decision. The fact that the other country was Saudi Arabia \u2014 a difficult ally that came under intense criticism for the killing and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, the dissident and Washington Post columnist \u2014 reinforced the long-standing criticism that the energy-rich kingdom buys U.S. support.\n\n\u201cWhat struck me about that tweet was not just that it\u2019s obviously wrong to allow Saudi Arabia to dictate our foreign policy, but that the president doesn\u2019t seem to be aware of how submissive it makes him look to say that,\u201d said Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., a former assistant secretary of state.\n\n\u201cIt is a big deal to attack oil fields,\u201d Malinowski added. \u201cIt does affect more than just Saudi Arabia\u2019s interests. But whatever we do, we have to do what\u2019s best for us and we have to recognize that the Saudis have a profound bias.\u201d\n\nTrump told reporters Monday that he had not \u201cpromised\u201d to protect the Saudis and that he would \u201csit down with the Saudis and work something out.\u201d But he expressed caution, suggesting that for all of his bellicose language, he was not rushing toward a military conflict.\n\nAsked whether Iran was behind the attack, Trump said, \u201cIt is looking that way.\u201d But he stopped short of definitive confirmation. \u201cThat is being checked out right now,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump warned that the United States had fearsome military abilities and was prepared for war if necessary. \u201cBut with all that being said, we would certainly like to avoid it,\u201d he added. \u201cI know they would like to make a deal,\u201d he said of the Iranians, whom he has been trying to draw into talks over their nuclear program. \u201cAt some point, it will work out.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence it will work out soon. The Iranian Foreign Ministry dismissed the notion on Monday that President Hassan Rouhani would meet Trump in New York next week when both are scheduled to attend the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. While Trump said in June that a meeting could happen without preconditions, and his own aides, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, repeated it last week, Trump called that \u201cfake news\u201d over the weekend and falsely blamed the news media for making it up.\n\nThe notion of the United States doing the bidding of the Saudis has a long and bristling history. Critics complained that Saudi Arabia effectively hired out the U.S. military to protect itself from Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq and reverse his invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The Saudi government even forked over $16 billion to reimburse the United States for about a quarter of the cost of the war that followed in 1991 \u2014 along with Kuwait, the most of any country.\n\nThe resentment felt over the years by U.S. officials crossed the ideological spectrum, summed up pithily in a leaked 2010 cable by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who served under both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. The Saudis, Gates told the French foreign minister at the time, always want to \u201cfight the Iranians to the last American.\u201d\n\nAmong those who seemed to share the sentiment in the past was a New York businessman and television entertainer named Donald Trump. \u201cSaudi Arabia should fight their own wars, which they won\u2019t, or pay us an absolute fortune to protect them and their great wealth-$ trillion!\u201d he tweeted in 2014.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- After oil installations were blown up in Saudi Arabia over the weekend, President Donald Trump declared that the United States was \"locked and loaded,\" a phrase that seemed to suggest he was ready to strike back.
