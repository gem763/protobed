The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son\u2019s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son \u2014 who enriched himself using his father\u2019s prestige.\n\nPresident Trump and Zelensky have denied any pressure to look into the Biden family was applied and the White House, in a nod to transparency, released the transcript of leaders\u2019 July 25th conversation last week.\n\n\u201cI think you read everything. I think you read text. I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I \u2014 so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,\u201d Zelensky told reporters at the United Nations in New York City last week.", "description": "House Democrats sent a letter to Mike Pence demanding his officer turn over documents related to Ukraine as part of their impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1052821174-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
