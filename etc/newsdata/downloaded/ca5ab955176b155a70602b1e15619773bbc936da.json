Just half say the same about members of Congress.\n\nSimilarly, 64% say local elected officials provide fair and accurate information to the public at least \u201csome of the time,\" while fewer than half (46%) say members of Congress do.\n\nPublic school principals and police officers get the highest marks for public trust.\n\nLocal officials are also viewed more favorably than state elected leaders, per a 2018 Gallup poll \u2014 the continuation of a 10-year trend.\n\n72% of U.S. adults say they have a \"great deal\" or a \"fair amount\" of trust in their local government. 63% say the same about their state government.\n\nBoth Republicans (74%) and Democrats (78%) share relatively high levels of confidence in local governments.\n\nDemocrats' trust has risen since 2016, Gallup notes, as they have turned to mayors and local officials to pick up the slack for the federal government.\n\n\"Cities can't wait for political change. Cities have problems, and cities develop solutions to those problems. And then they export those solutions.\"\n\n\u2014 Andrew Young, Jr., former member of Congress, mayor of Atlanta and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, speaking at a conference in Atlanta\n\nWhat's happening: States have been increasingly active during the Trump administration, with attorneys general challenging policies on immigration, energy and health care.\n\nThis week, a court confirmed states\u2019 authority to enact their own net neutrality rules, which is expected to open the door for statehouses to draft a variety of new internet protections.\n\nCalifornia has aggressively pursued consumer privacy laws that could become the defacto national standard. Nevada's own privacy rules went into effect this week.\n\nAt the local level, mayors and city councils have passed ordinances to address their communities\u2019 priorities \u2014 including issues where national leaders are stuck.\n\nMayors from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Columbia, South Carolina (and several others) have passed gun control ordinances in response to gun violence in their towns.\n\nLos Angeles and Miami have launched climate change initiatives.\n\nMinneapolis became the first city in the country to eliminate single-family zoning to tackle its affordable housing crisis. Oregon followed suit.\n\n\"I really think we're the last bastion of bipartisanship. That gives us the ability to be heard a bit differently,\" Bryan Barnett, mayor of Rochester Hills, Michigan, and president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n\nReality check: Local leaders aren't completely unassailable. Similar to how they view members of Congress, U.S. adults have negative opinions of local officials' ability to admit and take responsibility for mistakes, per Pew.", "description": "\"I really think we're the last bastion of bipartisanship.
