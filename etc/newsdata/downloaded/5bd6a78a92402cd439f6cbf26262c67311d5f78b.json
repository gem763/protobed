It found that eventual costs were 20 per cent \u2013 or \u00a314.3bn \u2013 higher, as the government had to cover delays and unplanned expenses, and missed out on income and profit from certain schemes.\n\n\u201cOur public services cannot function without outsourcing. But when it goes wrong, it\u2019s taxpayers who end up footing the bill,\u201d said Dr Joshua Pritchard, senior researcher at Reform.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Overruns and unexpected costs have cost the government an extra \u00a32.8bn, while another \u00a3600m has been lost in income from passengers due to delays in opening the line.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The third contract \u2013 with Seaborne Freight, which infamously had no ships \u2013 was cancelled earlier after a big shipping firm withdrew its support for the company.\n\nThe procurement, described as \u201crushed and risky\u201d by parliament\u2019s Public Accounts Committee, also opened the department to a court challenge from Eurotunnel, which had been excluded from the process, culminating in a \u00a333m out-of-court settlement.\n\nThe total \u00a384.4m in extra expenses amounted to 82 per cent of the original value of the contracts, almost doubling their cost.\n\nThe Reform think tank argues for the creation of an independent regulator for outsourcing, which makes up a third of total public spending and amounts to \u00a34,227 per British citizen a year.\n\nIt points out that organisations such as the National Audit Office and parliamentary select committees, which carry out the bulk of outsourcing investigations, lack the power to enforce change or sanction those responsible for overspending.\n\n\u201cWe need a new regulator with the power to prevent public money being squandered because of totally avoidable mistakes,\u201d said Dr Pritchard.", "description": "Mistakes in the outsourcing of public services have cost UK taxpayers \u00a314.3bn, according to analysis of official investigations that haven taken place in the past three years.", "authors": ["Olesya Dmitracova"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/21/12/hs2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
