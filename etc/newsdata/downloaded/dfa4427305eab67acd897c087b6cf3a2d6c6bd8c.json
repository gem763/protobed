This is \u201cone of the most unsafe places in the world to be a woman,\u201d President Cyril Ramaphosa said Wednesday.\n\nEmpowering women is one of the issues Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, will address on a 10-day, multi-country visit, along with wildlife protection, entrepreneurship, mental health and mine clearance - a topic given global attention by Harry\u2019s late mother, Princess Diana, when she walked through an active mine field during an Africa visit years ago.\n\nSome in South Africa said they are happy to see the arrival of Meghan, who has been vocal about women\u2019s rights and is likely to speak out again. One of her first events is a visit to a workshop that gives self-defense classes to young girls.\n\n\u201cI think the Duchess of Sussex\u2019 visit is perfectly timed. She\u2019s coming to South Africa at an incredibly turbulent time,\u201d said Lara Rosmarin, who leads a local tech incubator that will be part of the royal visit. \u201cPeople are anxious, people are scared, people are worried \u2026 She\u2019s coming at a time when she can instill some hope and some promise and perhaps highlight the struggles of women in South Africa.\u201d\n\nThe high-profile visit by the royal family is expected to contrast with the breathtaking series of stories in local media in recent weeks about the reported abuse of women and children - \u201ceven babies,\u201d the president reminded Parliament this week.\n\nThe scope is now well known. More than 2,700 women were murdered last year, and more than 1,000 children, the government says. One in five women over age 18 have faced physical violence from a partner.\n\n\u201cThe conviction rate for rape is a shameful 5%,\u201d the leader of the main opposition Democratic Alliance, Mmusi Maimane, said Wednesday. The state should oppose bail for suspects, deny parole to those found guilty and ensure that a life sentence means life in prison, South Africa\u2019s president now says.\n\nSome women want more, saying South Africa should bring back the death penalty for rapists. Capital punishment was abolished in the country in 1995.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, the royal family likely will focus on the positive. Planned events in their first public stop, Cape Town, include a visit to a non-governmental group that trains surfers to provide young people with mental health services.\n\n\u201cShe is a very influential person and just for her to be here and to some way influence the girls on our program \u2026 is a big part of why we\u2019re excited to have her here,\u201d said Courtney Barnes, a surfing coach with Waves For Change.\n\nHarry and Meghan also will visit the oldest mosque in South Africa and meet with Nobel Peace Prize winner and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. A \u201crare privilege and honor,\u201d Tutu and his wife, Leah, said Thursday.\n\nThe prince later will break away for visits to Botswana, Angola and Malawi with a special focus on wildlife protection.\n\nIn Angola, Harry will walk in the footsteps of his mother, whose walk across a mine field in 1997 helped to inspire an international ban on anti-personnel mines later that year. That field in Huambo is now a busy street, and Angola\u2019s government, now years past a grinding civil war, hopes to be free of land mines by 2025.\n\n\u201cHe will revisit the area his mother visited, and I think that will be a very poignant moment of coming full circle,\u201d said Ralph Legg, country director for the mine-clearing organization The HALO Trust, adding that local people remember Diana fondly for taking notice of their plight. \u201cIt will be very striking once people compare those images from the two visits to see how far Angola has come.\u201d\n\nHuambo province is one mine field away from being declared mine-free, Legg said, adding that Angola could achieve its goal of being mine-free by 2025 with enough support from the international community.\n\nWhile Harry is traveling, Meghan will remain in South Africa with events including a Johannesburg visit to a charity that helps to raise awareness of sexual violence in schools.\n\nThe royal family\u2019s Africa visit ends on Oct. 2.\n\n___\n\nDay reported from Cape Town.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, along with their infant son, Archie, are making their first official tour as a family, starting Monday in a troubled South Africa whose president says women and children are \"under siege\" by shocking violence.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Cara Anna", "Eliza Day"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/africa_royals_visit_97060_c0-82-3000-1831_s1770x1032.jpg?31b24d33757d61e4b9ccf419f9f0a50f4ff0ed24", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
