Bob Reid [the head of science features] felt the team seemed to wallow in the sadism of their humour.\u2019\n\nPhotos of rarely-seen-before moments of the comedy have been released in time for its 50th anniversary\n\nJohn Cleese as the Inspector, Graham Chapman as Superintendent Parrot, and Terry Jones as Mr Milton star in the 'Crunchy Frog' sketch.

It is a parody of the film director\u2019s blood-soaked Westerns featuring members of the upper-class who suffer violent injuries from a tennis racquet and a piano.\n\nBBC bosses also took umbrage with the pranks the quintet played on fellow comic Sir David Frost. In the Mouse Problem sketch, Cleese gave out his home phone number, while his home address was used in the Marriage Guidance Counsellor skit.\n\nGraham Chapman (pictured from left) as the working-class playwright, Eric Idle as his son Ken, and Terry Jones as the playwright's wife in the sketch 'Working-Class Playwright'\n\nThe cast don Victorian style costumes and enjoy some time off-camera at the beach between filming\n\nThe Pythons had worked with Sir David on his hit satire programme The Frost Report so their jokes were friendly, but they caused concern for BBC executives, reported The Times.\n\nYesterday, Shane Allen, BBC Controller of Comedy Commissioning, said: \u2018The Pythons tore up the rule book of comedy grammar, conventions and traditions, but thankfully the support for creative freedom won the day and has certainly paid off in the long run as audiences continue to celebrate and revere their enormous impact on comedy.\u2019\n\nBBC History\u2019s \u2018Monty Python at 50\u2019 is at www.bbc.com/historyofthebbc/anniver saries/october/python50", "description": "BBC bosses were left shocked by the 'cruel and nihilistic' values of Monty Python after new archive documents were unearthed to celebrate the show's 50th anniversary.", "authors": ["David Wilkes For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/02/19321418-0-image-a-42_1570238600724.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
