She loved to learn how to do new things whether it was a fun activity or an educational task.\n\n'As heartbreaking as this is I am so proud that in such a short period of time my little girl had managed to touch so many people's lives, which made her such a special child. We will all miss her terribly.'\n\nThe full inquest will take place at a later date.", "description": "Leighane Redmond, 27, and her three-year-old daughter Melsadie Parris died when they were hit by an express train at Taplow Station in Buckinghamshire in February.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19499502-0-image-a-26_1570636119070.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
