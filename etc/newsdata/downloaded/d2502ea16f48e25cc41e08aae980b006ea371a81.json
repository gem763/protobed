Breast cancer was the last thing on Canovai\u2019s mind, as she was focused on becoming a new mom and her unborn son\u2019s health.\n\nMOM DIAGNOSED WITH RARE BREAST CANCER DURING PREGNANCY DELIVERS 'MIRACLE' BABY BOY\n\nPrior to the biopsy that confirmed her diagnosis, Canovai was confident the lump was a fibroadenoma, a common non-cancerous lump, or a clogged milk duct, which can also produce small, hard lumps in the breasts.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there was not a genetic cause of Canovai\u2019s cancer, which made the news more difficult to wrap her head around, she said.\n\nAbout 10 to 20 percent of breast cancers are triple-negative breast cancers, which means that the growth of the cancer is not fueled by the hormones estrogen and progesterone, or by the HER2 protein, so it will not respond to hormonal therapy medicines or those that target HER2 protein receptions, according to BreastCancer.org.\n\nIt\u2019s considered to be more aggressive and have a poorer prognosis than other types of breast cancer, and is more likely to spread beyond the breast and more likely to recur after treatment. It\u2019s also more likely to be diagnosed in people younger than 50, and in those who have a BRCA1 mutation.\n\nAfter overcoming the initial shock of her diagnosis, an \u201coverwhelming amount of support helped me to have that positive outlook that I wanted to have but struggled to find at first,\u201d she said, noting her husband, family, friends and church groups greatly helped her throughout her battle.\n\nCanovai underwent a single mastectomy and several rounds of chemotherapy at the Comprehensive Cancer Center at Wake Forest Baptist Health. The former cheerleader said doctors and nurses at the facility only added to her support network, becoming her new \u201cteam.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were in my corner,\u201d said Canovai, referring to the doctors who treated her, which included an oncologist, an oncology surgeon, a reconstruction surgeon, a genetic counselor and a high-risk obstetrician.\n\n\u201cOnce I realized that treatment was an option, surgery was OK and chemo would be fine (...) I felt a lot more comfortable because I knew my doctors were not only there for me but for my child as well,\u201d she told Wake Forest Baptist Health in a blog post.\n\nAt 34 weeks, about three weeks before she was scheduled to be induced, Canovai underwent an emergency C-section. She welcomed her son, Roman on the morning of Jan. 10.\n\nIDENTICAL TWIN NURSES IN GEORGIA DELIVER IDENTICAL TWIN BABIES\n\n\u201cHe had more hair than me,\u201d she joked.\n\nFollowing Roman\u2019s birth, Canovai continued treatment, which included more chemotherapy and radiation. In July, she was declared cancer-free.\n\n\u201cThe whole time it didn't seem real. I could feel him, but finally being able to hold him \u2014 it just made everything up to that point worth it,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving him inside me gave me the extra drive [to fight] and an instant bond that I'll be able to share with him later in life.\u201d\n\nFox News' Alexandria Hein contributed to this report.", "description": "A North Carolina mom diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer while she was pregnant with her first child says God, family\u00a0and friends helped her throughout her battle.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
