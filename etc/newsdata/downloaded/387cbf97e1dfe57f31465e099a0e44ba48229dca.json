It could then be officially passed into law by the end of this week, setting up the UK's first December election since 1923.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson had previously tried unsuccessfully to call a snap poll over the Brexit impasse three times.\n\nHe hopes an election will return a Conservative Party majority government so he can pass his recently inked Brexit deal and take the UK out of the EU.\n\nJohnson had repeatedly pledged to exit the bloc by October 31, the UK's previous Brexit deadline, before being forced to request a three-month extension from Brussels after MPs blocked his attempt to rush the new withdrawal agreement through Parliament.\n\nThe prime minister said it was \"time to get the country united and get Brexit done\" after leaving a meeting with Conservative MPs shortly after the vote was held.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, has meanwhile described the poll as a \"once in a generation chance\" to transform the country and \"take on the vested interests holding people back\".\n\n\"We will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change that our country has ever seen,\" Corbyn said in Parliament.\n\nThe General Election has just been called.\n\n\n\nIt's time for real change. pic.twitter.com/aiUwhxm5K6 \u2014 Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) October 29, 2019\n\nJo Swinson, leader of the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats party, also welcomed MPs' decision to back the snap election.\n\n\"This general election will decide the future of our country for generations. It is our best chance to elect a government to stop Brexit,\" Swinson told MPs.\n\n\"The Liberal Democrats are the strongest party of Remain and will be standing on a manifesto to stop Brexit by revoking article 50,\" she added, referring to the exit clause within the Lisbon Treaty, the terms of which form the constitutional basis of the EU.", "description": "MPs vote in favour of December poll after months of impasse in Parliament over Britain's Brexit crisis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/073f11db5e064c21a1955001d709c5fc_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
