Court McGee via unanimous decision (29-28, 30-27, 30-27)\n\nUpdated records: Brady (11-0 MMA, 1-0 UFC), McGee (19-9 MMA, 8-8 UFC)\n\nKey stat: Brady became the first fighter to score a knockdown on McGee since Santiago Ponzinibbio at UFC on FOX 19 in April 2016.\n\nBrady on the fight\u2019s key moment\n\n\u201cI dropped him and he came back. He\u2019s only been finished one time for a reason, and I think I came close to doing that again. My biggest thing coming into this fight was not trying to force a finish, gas myself out, and lose off of that. His pressure is something I\u2019ve never dealt with before, if I had tried to jump on him after I dropped him, I would have probably just gotten myself into trouble. I want to finish people. I want to knock them out. I want to submit them. But winning is the only thing that matters.\u201d\n\nBrady on the emotions of his first UFC win\n\n\u201cGetting my first UFC win is huge. I didn\u2019t want to think about it too much with how different it would be, but it really was. It\u2019s the big stage. It\u2019s the real deal. It\u2019s the NFL or NBA of fighting, and I\u2019ve worked the last 10 years of my life dedicating my whole life to fighting. To get here and to win just means the world to me. I feel like I could cry talking about it. It means so much to me and my family, my coaches, just everyone who has sacrificed so much for me to get here.\u201d\n\nBrady on what he wants next\n\n\u201cI want to move myself up \u2013 11-0, 12-0, 13-0, that\u2019s the only thing that matters to me. I\u2019m here to win fights. As long as they say I\u2019m good, I want to fight again this year. I was signed back in March and wanted to fight more this year. Things happened. It is what it is, but I just want to fight and keep getting better.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Brady, check out the video of the full post-fight interview above.", "description": "Sean Brady explains why fighting intelligently got him the win in his octagon debut against Court McGee at UFC on ESPN 6.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Simon Samano", "The Blue Corner", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/sean-brady-ufc-boston-post-fight-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
