Can I come and get my crowbar back?\n\n'This is Bristol Bike Takers and I take everything, even your daughter.'\n\nAncel, of Bristol, admitted a catalogue of offences and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal, conspiracy to burgle, six burglaries and six charges of driving while disqualified.\n\nBristol Crown Court heard he saw bikes advertised online, went to the addresses of the sellers and took a vast number of vehicles while people were asleep in their homes or away.\n\nTyreece Ancel, 19, was jailed for seven years after filming himself joyriding in hijacked cars, including a BMW, Mazda and Mini Cooper\n\nDuring one short video Ancel can be seen sawing off a bike lock in one scene and then later heard saying: 'Repo, repo, all from one house, lovely, lovely, lovely!'\n\nJudge William Hart sentenced him to seven years in a Young Offenders Institution yesterday.\n\nHe told Ancel: 'You have a bad record for anyone, particularly for one so young.
