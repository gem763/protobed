He was playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers at the time.\n\nThe lawsuit said that after Brown \"cornered Ms. Taylor, forced her down onto a bed, pushed her face into the mattress, and forcibly raped her,\" she confronted him about what happened.\n\nRead more: New lawsuit accuses Antonio Brown of raping his fitness trainer\n\nThe lawsuit said Taylor had fled Brown's house crying, leaving behind her belongings, and returned the next day to pick them up.\n\n\"She courageously approached Brown, telling him that they 'needed to talk about last night.' He replied, 'You made me feel like a real rapist,'\" the lawsuit said.\n\nTaylor, who now lives in Tennessee, said in the lawsuit that over the next several months, she lost 30 pounds, had nearly daily panic attacks and frequent suicidal thoughts, and \"fell into a deep depression.\"\n\nShe first reported the incident to #TimesUpNow in January, though she did not name Brown, the lawsuit said. She then filed a civil suit after speaking to a former assistant district attorney and sex-crimes prosecutor at her church.\n\nNFL leaders are meeting on Wednesday to discuss the allegations. Brown could be put on the commissioner's exempt list, which would make him ineligible to play, according to The Washington Post.\n\nNo criminal charges have been filed against Brown, though he could face punishment by the NFL under its personal-conduct policy.", "description": "In a federal lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida, Britney Taylor, a fitness trainer, accused the NFL player Antonio Brown of sexual assault.", "authors": ["Kelly Mclaughlin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d73ddb12e22af52cc419344-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
