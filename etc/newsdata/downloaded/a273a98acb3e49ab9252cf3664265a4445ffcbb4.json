Matthew\u2019s biological mother had used drugs up until she was several months pregnant with him. The children\u2019s parents were later jailed because of drug use, Ellinger told the Idaho Statesman .\n\nWhen Matthew came into Ellinger\u2019s care, she immediately sought mental health services for him. They saw a child-parent interaction therapist, a child psychiatrist and an attachment therapist.\n\nBut Matthew started to become violent with his siblings and family pets by age 5. He killed a kitten and tried to harm his younger brother and sister.\n\nMatthew has a wide array of diagnoses now: reactive attachment disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (known as ADHD), explosive behavior disorder, disruptive behavior disorder, serious emotional disturbance and mild intellectual disability.\n\nAfter years of trying to find help in Idaho\u2019s mental and behavioral health systems, Ellinger made the decision this summer for Matthew to receive residential psychiatric treatment in Little Rock, Arkansas - 1,803 miles from home. After applying for residential treatment through Medicaid, she said the treatment center in Little Rock was one of few in the nation that could help her son\u2019s specific needs.\n\nHundreds of beleaguered parents of children with serious emotional and mental health needs have found that Idaho has no place for their children to go for residential psychiatric care, so the only options are out of state.\n\nBetween 25 and 30 new applications for such care are filed each month in Idaho, said Ross Edmunds, administrator at the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare\u2019s Division of Behavioral Health. And about 100 children are in residential facilities now, he said.\n\nDemand for those services has surged in recent years, Edmunds said. That is likely due to Idaho\u2019s population growth, as well as better recognition of mental illness and the treatment options available, he said.\n\nEdmunds said it should be \u201ca last resort\u201d to place a child in a facility far away from home. But it is necessary in some cases.\n\n___\n\nRESIDENTIAL TREATMENT \u2018A LONG-TERM GOAL\u2019\n\nIdaho has only one psychiatric residential treatment facility for children. It\u2019s in Idaho Falls. The other 35 facilities that can take Idaho patients are in other states.\n\nA psychiatric residential facility isn\u2019t just a place where patients spend time getting therapy and medications. It is a special type of non-hospital facility that contracts with Medicaid to provide inpatient care to patients younger than 21.\n\nWith only one such facility in Idaho, families are forced to send their children elsewhere. While no parent wants a child to be far from home, many say it is often the best thing for their sons or daughters, and their families.\n\nThe treatment isn\u2019t permanent, though, spanning from a few months to years, depending on the needs of the child.\n\nBut when a child is ready to return to Idaho, some parents say gaps in step-down services, which transition the child from psychiatric residential treatment to in-home or community-based treatments, can lead to children returning to the out-of-state facility or to a crisis for the family.\n\n\u201cIt takes a wide expertise of mental health services and a wide range of provider expertise to really have what you need within your state,\u201d Ruth York, executive director of the Idaho Federation of Families for Children\u2019s Mental Health, said in a phone interview. \u201cThis is definitely a long-term goal that is being worked on.\u201d\n\nLike Ellinger, many parents want to be proactive about getting their children access to mental health care. Beginning to find help, however, can be a challenge.\n\nLaura Wallis has a story about that. Wallis is director of operations for the Idaho Parent Network for Children\u2019s Mental Health, which acts as a liaison among families, providers and the state. She says that when she first tried to communicate her son\u2019s symptoms to his pediatrician, he ignored her and suggested that she was the problem.\n\nHer son later received psychiatric residential treatment out of state.\n\nMany parents seeking mental health resources for their children feel completely alone. Some people tell them their children just need to be more active. Others blame the parents. Some people don\u2019t believe the child\u2019s symptoms are a real health concern.\n\n\u201cEveryone tries to find a reason that it\u2019s not the kid who has a medical condition, but it\u2019s some outside thing,\u201d Wallis said in a phone interview. \u201cSo the very first thing that many, many families find is that either no one believes them, or no one wants to get involved.\u201d\n\nEven if they push through the stigma and misconceptions surrounding mental health, many parents say Idaho\u2019s system is reactive, not proactive.\n\nThe state still struggles to find mental health professionals to fill jobs, and it is difficult for existing facilities to meet the standards required for Medicaid to fund treatment.\n\n___\n\nTHE STATE OF MENTAL HEALTH IN IDAHO\n\nFamilies that receive Medicaid are generally the least able to afford intensive mental health care for their children. And unlike much private health insurance, Medicaid covers that care. For Medicaid to pay for residential treatment, however, the child must be placed in a certified psychiatric residential treatment facility.\n\nTeton Peaks Residential Treatment Center in Idaho Falls is the sole such facility in the Gem State; it is run by the Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center. Only girls ages 12-18 can receive treatment at Teton Peaks, which means that boys and younger children have no options other than going out of state.\n\nWallis said it can take more than three years to license a facility, and because most private insurance won\u2019t cover residential care to the needed extent, it becomes nearly impossible to open new centers in Idaho.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the state isn\u2019t trying. Edmunds said the department is working with existing facilities in hopes of turning some into nationally accredited operations that meet Medicaid\u2019s requirements.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly trying to do that because we recognize . what\u2019s better for the kids and the family,\u201d Edmunds said. \u201cIt is better for kids and families if we can keep them in-state and closer to home, or as close to home as possible.\u201d\n\nFour Idaho hospitals provide inpatient psychiatric hospitalization for children. That treatment, however, is usually limited to five to 10 days - not nearly long enough for some children to return home safely. Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center in Boise provides services for children 12 and younger. Intermountain Hospital, also in Boise, cares for adolescents. The other hospitals are in Idaho Falls and Coeur d\u2019Alene.\n\n___\n\nRETURNING HOME\n\nJen Griffis\u2019 family has accessed different residential treatments out of state for her daughter over the past seven years.\n\nOnce, when her daughter was discharged from treatment and able to come home, she needed to go back into residential treatment after six months because she did not have step-down care where they live, in Grangeville.\n\nAfter a child has received care in a psychiatric residential treatment facility, the next step to transition home is often to go to a less-intensive treatment center or a group home.\n\nIdaho offers some of these step-down resources but not all of them.\n\n\u201cYou really have to look at us needing more resources on a spectrum of intensity,\u201d Griffis said in a phone interview. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the system benefits families when they put children in residential treatment without solid community resources and a transition plan home.\u201d\n\nEdmunds said he knows children sometimes need transitional care to readjust. Sometimes the child\u2019s illness put tremendous stress on the family, and the family needs help to adjust, too.\n\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t find a one-size-fits-all,\u201d he said.\n\nEllinger worries that the detachment from family while her son is out of state will forever alter their relationship and family dynamic. Matthew already had challenges with bonding and attachment, and she worries they will get worse. And what will happen if he returns to Emmett, where there is little help, or if he ages out of the treatment center or the system as a whole?\n\n\u201cFor six years of our life, I\u2019ve sacrificed everything to help him,\u201d she said. \u201cI was forced to place him in residential knowing that at 8 years old, it may be something we can never recover from.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLAWSUIT FORCED AN OVERHAUL\n\nIdaho\u2019s mental health system for children is undergoing major changes because of the introduction of Youth Empowerment Services, or YES. Some parents think the project is a fantastic start because its focus is on community-based services.\n\nThe services are a result of a yearslong lawsuit: the Jeff D. class action lawsuit. The lawsuit began in 1980. At the time, children were integrated with adults at State Hospital South. There weren\u2019t appropriate treatment and education services for children.\n\nGriffis said there has been a shift from a mindset that forced the child to fit the system, to a mindset that makes the system work for the child and family based on their specific needs.\n\nNow, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, State Department of Education and Idaho Department of Juvenile Corrections have worked together to build a new system that \u201ccommunicates a child\u2019s treatment goals between providers and agencies to reduce duplicated effort and conflicting treatment plans,\u201d according to the YES website.\n\n\u201cIf those are put into place effectively, those are huge steps to getting to that point where it can fill that gap,\u201d Griffis said.\n\nThe goal of YES is to strengthen the mental health care system in Idaho, but that takes time, funding and professionals.\n\nYork, the Idaho Federation of Families for Children\u2019s Mental Health leader, said one component that\u2019s weak right now, but is set to be improved, is intensive home-based community services. A child would be able to receive intensive services closer to home.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019d gotten (those services) in the home or community early enough, we probably would have prevented the various crises that resulted in needing a residential place out of state,\u201d York said. \u201cBut not always. There are always going to be times where it\u2019s just not safe for the child and family to share the same place.\u201d\n\nWhile YES is a start, many parents think there needs to be a dynamic cultural shift to change the children\u2019s mental health system in Idaho.\n\nParents have said they want to see incentives for professionals to help build the system; they want to see a more proactive approach when it comes to treating children\u2019s mental health needs; and they want to be heard and recognized, not ignored.\n\n\u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day. We\u2019re building something much bigger than Rome,\u201d Wallis said. \u201cRome was buildings. These are lives. It\u2019s a cultural change we are making, and Idaho is in a position to be amazing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Idaho Statesman, http://www.idahostatesman.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When Tricia Ellinger adopted Matthew, her oldest son, at age 2, she never thought that at age 8 he would be living half a continent away from their home in Emmett.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Maddie Capron"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
