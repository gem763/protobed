Along with the support of loving parents, activists like Greta Thunberg have another ally \u2014 brilliant and world-famous children\u2019s musician, Raffi.\n\nLast month, Raffi released a new song, one he penned specifically for Greta Thunberg called \u201cYoung People Marching.\u201d Fatherly is proud to present the entire song right here.\n\nhttps://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/young-people-marching-august-20-1220.mp3\n\nRaffi is no stranger to activist politics. Last year, the singer told us that he styled himself as a folk singer in the tradition of Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie. And prior to \u201cYoung People Marching,\u201d back in 2007, Raffi released the song \u201cCool It,\u201d which became a children\u2019s anthem about Global Warming.\n\nThe lyrics of \u201cYoung People Marching\u201d are as inspirational as they are brilliant. But, what is probably the coolest thing about the song is that he actually samples great moments from Greta Thunberg\u2019s actual speeches. \u201cYoung people are speaking their truth to power. The science is clear. It\u2019s late in the hour.\u201d\n\nFor countless parents, Raffi is a staple of a child\u2019s gateway into music in general. My daughter loves everything from \u201cDog on the Floor\u201d to his timeless hit, \u201cBaby Beluga.\u201d But, with \u201cYoung People Marching,\u201d Raffi proves that older generations can constantly learn from the new ones. That we as parents, and as people, can be inspired by children, and be moved to change.\n\nYou can download \u201cYoung People Marching\u201d and learn more about Raffi Foundation For Child Honouring right here.\n\nAnd here\u2019s Greta Thunberg\u2019s full speech:\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe post Listen To Raffi\u2019s New Song In Honor of Greta Thunberg appeared first on Fatherly.", "description": "With \"Young People Marching\" Raffi is a brilliant ally to child protesters everywhere.", "authors": ["Ryan Britt"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZIq6MrU6gLxmdXXg_Grqyg--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/fatherly_721/311164d8dfc1fa309c80f6ae68ea2f5b", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
