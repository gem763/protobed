REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/File Photo\n\nAt home, he and his Brexit strategy remain under siege this week as his 11th-hour divorce agreement with the European Union hangs in the balance in a parliament outside his control.\n\nThere is one place, however, where he has earned grudging respect over the past few weeks: Brussels. On the other side of the Channel, EU negotiators who once dismissed him as \u201ca clown\u201d now take him seriously and believe he may yet pull it off.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s closer than they have ever been,\u201d an EU diplomat said after a weekend of high drama in the British parliament, where Johnson on Monday was pushing for a vote on his deal after an unexpected delay on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIf there is anyone who can do it in the House of Commons, it\u2019s him. If not, we will be back to square one in a few days or weeks,\u201d the diplomat said.\n\nJohnson\u2019s ability to overcome deep European scepticism and salvage the stranded negotiating process was forged during an off-the-record countryside stroll with Ireland\u2019s leader, Leo Varadkar, on Thursday, Oct. 10.\n\nJohnson\u2019s turnaround, insiders on both sides of the talks said, came after the process was on the verge of collapse on Tuesday, Oct. 8.\n\nJust a week earlier, the European side had rejected outright Johnson\u2019s latest proposal to resolve the persistent sticking point of how to deal with the border between Northern Ireland, part of the UK, and Ireland, which remains part of the EU, after Brexit without upsetting a decades-old peace deal.\n\nJohnson\u2019s suggestions were vague and lacked legal foundation, the EU side had said.\n\nThe crisis over the so-called Irish backstop, intended to prevent a hard border on the island, seemed insurmountable three weeks before Britain was set to crash out without an agreement.\n\nThe low point came during an acrimonious phone call earlier on Oct. 8, when German Chancellor Angela Merkel bluntly told Johnson that the EU would not accept customs checks on the island of Ireland.\n\nDetails of the confidential call quickly leaked from a source at 10 Downing Street, upsetting the Germans. Fuming at Merkel\u2019s suggestion, Johnson\u2019s aides unleashed their fury, breaking every diplomatic code in the book and texting reporters: \u201cThey aren\u2019t engaging or negotiating seriously.\u201d Another Downing Street source said a deal was \u201cessentially impossible\u201d.\n\nBy lunchtime that day, a taunting tweet from European Council President Donald Tusk added a sense of peril: \u201cAt stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis?\u201d\n\nTusk was telling Johnson he was marching into disaster of a split without an agreement.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Understanding the Irish border - here)\n\nOUT OF THE WRECKAGE\n\nAt that precise moment Johnson broke from the orthodox Brexit playbook his predecessor Theresa May had stuck to unsuccessfully for more than two years.\n\nThat evening, after the Merkel call that one EU diplomatic source called Johnson\u2019s \u201crendezvous with reality,\u201d he rang Varadkar to set up a meeting.\n\nIt \u201ccame out of the wreckage of the Merkel call,\u201d one UK source familiar with the conversation said. \u201cWe were in the last roll of the dice territory at that stage.\u201d\n\nIt turned out to be a political masterstroke from the same man who had been on a path of brinkmanship just days before.\n\n\u201cJohnson left the call feeling the way to a deal was through Varadkar\u2019s heart. But time was running out and he decided clearly to do the impossible \u2013 reopen the backstop, get a deal and campaign on a platform of having delivered an orderly Brexit,\u201d said an EU official directly involved in Brexit talks.\n\nThey agreed to meet at Thornton Manor, a rustic Elizabethan house near Liverpool in northwest England, where the two strolled side by side down a grassy, tree-lined path among artistically manicured gardens.\n\n\u201cThey spent at last half of the three-hour meeting one-on-one,\u201d one Irish source said. \u201cBoris emerged looking for coffee after about 45 minutes and went back in again.\u201d\n\nIt was here that Johnson and Varadkar discussed a way to resolve the dreaded Irish backstop, the red line between Britain and the EU that no one had been able to bridge.\n\n\u201cThe deal really became possible the minute Johnson dropped the idea of customs checks on the island of Ireland,\u201d another EU diplomat said. \u201cThat happened in his meeting with Varadkar in the manor house. It unlocked the whole thing.\u201d\n\nAny doubts on the Irish side about Johnson\u2019s intentions had been virtually erased, with Varadkar coming away saying \u201cthat he was certain that the prime minister wanted a deal.\u201d\n\nJohnson used his jovial character to disarm European leaders, who in the end saw past his early diplomatic gaffes and spoke of an affable man of substance. Video footage showed Johnson embracing and laughing with counterparts at the European Council on Thursday, a sharp contrast with May\u2019s awkward and solitary appearance in the chamber just months earlier, when she was also left to eat alone while leaders sat down for an hours-long dinner together.\n\nOnce seen as a jester, who put his foot on the table at France\u2019s Elysee Palace ahead of a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron and abandoned a press conference with Luxembourg\u2019s leader to avoid heckling protesters - had won credibility.\n\nFILE PHOTO: General view of the House of Commons after the announcement of the result of the vote on the deal delay as parliament discusses Brexit, sitting on a Saturday for the first time since the 1982 Falklands War, in London, Britain, October 19, 2019, in this screen grab taken from video.

Those who didn\u2019t take him seriously were wrong.\u201d", "description": "In 90 days as British prime minister, Boris Johnson has been humiliated in parliament, drawn mass street protests, tasted heavy defeat in the courts and suffered significant departures from his government, including his own brother.", "authors": ["Anthony Deutsch", "Gabriela Baczynska", "Padraic Halpin", "Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443333275&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0UK", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
