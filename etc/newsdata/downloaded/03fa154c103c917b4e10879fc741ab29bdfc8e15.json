I mean, there\u2019s a lot of actors in the mix. And so four months is what I could get. And then when we finish, it\u2019ll be a longer season because it\u2019s out last season. Then I\u2019ll come right back.\u201d\n\nFonda said she is moving to Washington \u201cto be at the epicenter of the fight for our climate,\u201d in a statement on her official website.\n\n\u201cEvery Friday through January, I will be leading weekly demonstrations on Capitol Hill to demand that action by our political leaders be taken to address the climate emergency we are in. We can\u2019t afford to wait.\u201d\n\nThe Netflix star said she was inspired by young people, including 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\n\u201cI mean, I knew about Greta, I didn\u2019t know she was on the spectrum. And I really didn\u2019t know what Asperger\u2019s meant,\u201d Fonda told the Times. \u201cOn the spectrum, if they are interested in something, they have a laser focus on that and whatever the denials and rationalizations the rest of us indulge in, that doesn\u2019t come into play with her.\u201d\n\nFonda also talked about her feelings about President Donald Trump. \u201cI did not expect it would be this bad. I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Klute actress also said she called Jared Kushner, who is the president\u2019s son-in-law and advisor, about environmental issues. Fonda said that Kushner told her to speak to his wife, Ivanka Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd so I called her And she said, \u2018I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u2019 Nothing,\u201d recalled Fonda.\n\nOn her website, the actress says, \u201cI will be on the Capitol every Friday, rain or shine, inspired and emboldened by the incredible movement our youth have created. I can no longer stand by and let our elected officials ignore \u2013 and even worse \u2013 empower \u2013 the industries that are destroying our planet for profit. We can not continue to stand for this.\u201d\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?
