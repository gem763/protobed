He\u2019ll also meet with Premier Li Keqiang and National People\u2019s Congress Chairman Li Zhanshu, the No. 2 and No. 3 ranked members of the ruling Communist Party.\n\nBolsonaro arrived in Beijing on Thursday facing a looming question of whether Brazil should allow Huawei Technologies Co. to build its 5G network. The decision risks upsetting the delicate balancing act Bolsonaro has so far managed between China and the U.S., its first- and second-biggest trading partners.\n\nXi is expected to pay a reciprocal visit to Brazil next month while in South America for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meetings in Chile. China\u2019s vast appetite for commodities helped drive up total trade between the two countries to $113 billion in 2018 and the South American nation is its eighth-biggest trading partner.\n\nAgricultural Goods\n\nChina will probably grant more approvals in the coming weeks for Brazilian meat plants to export to the Asian nation, Brazilian Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina said in a video posted on her Twitter account Thursday. China last month granted permission to 25 additional Brazilian beef, pork and poultry plants to ship to the Asian country, raising the number of approved facilities to 89.\n\nWhile the Brazilian president will be accompanied by his foreign and agriculture ministers for this week\u2019s state visit, members of his economic team are set to come at a later date. \u201cThe absence of senior economic advisers suggest there won\u2019t be any major announcements besides a possible increase in commodity deals,\u201d said Hussein Kalout, a Harvard University political scientist and one of Brazil\u2019s leading scholars on international relations.\n\nAround 40% of Brazilian exports, mostly commodities, head to China. Chinese companies also invest heavily in Brazil, which is seeking foreign investors to participate in its privatization program to accelerate its sluggish economic growth.\n\nHuawei Decision\n\nBolsonaro has long been a fan of U.S. President Donald Trump and he expressed skepticism over Beijing\u2019s investment prior to his election victory last year, saying the Chinese were allowed to \u201cbuy in Brazil, but not buy Brazil.\u201d Bolsonaro, however, has since toned down some of his criticism and adopted a pragmatic approach.\n\nIn May, he sent Vice President Hamilton Mourao to smooth over any awkwardness with Beijing. While there, Mourao met with Huawei\u2019s billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei and said that Brazil had no intention of restricting the firm\u2019s activities in the country. The company has been active in Brazil for over 20 years.\n\nHuawei\u2019s bid to build Brazil\u2019s 5G network is widely expected to be discussed, although Bolsonaro told journalists in Japan on Tuesday that the issue wasn\u2019t on his radar. Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo recently said Brazil would choose its 5G partner soon.\n\nAfter China, Bolsonaro is also set to visit the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, where he\u2019ll seek further investments from local sovereign funds in renewable energy, defense and infrastructure. Brazil also seeks to calm Arab countries\u2019 anxieties over its unabashed support of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.", "description": "Bolsonaro to Meet China\u2019s Xi in Bid to Balance Ties With U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf549d03e48a2464e88d436079f43a1be.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
