I get migraines and tension headaches all the time, which probably isn't helped by the fact that I always forget to drink water.\n\nThe only thing I've found that gives my back and shoulders immediate relief from the tension is this $45 shiatsu massager I got on Amazon years ago.\n\nThis massager features four rotating, heated nodes that knead away the stress of the day and get deep into the knots in my shoulders and back. The nodes switch directions every few minutes just like they would in a massage chair, which prevents bruising and helps to melt away muscular tension from different angles. The heated element, which can be turned on or off, helps to warm the muscles up and keep them limber through the massage.\n\nIt's the closest thing I've experienced to a professional massage at home, minus the $250 price tag, plus the convenience of being able to watch TV while using it.\n\nZyllion\n\nThe base has two elastic straps that Velcro together in the middle so you can secure it around a chair or head-rest, though I find that it's better to just keep the straps hanging from the side so you can use them to adjust the positioning of the massager when it's in use. Any purchase of the massager comes with a car adapter that allows you to plug it into a cigarette lighter, but I personally don't advise using this in the car \u2014 it's not particularly comfortable when placed right behind your head, and the strength of the nodes will force your head to move around in a way that may be unsafe while driving.\n\nIt's important to note that one cycle lasts 20 minutes, and 20 minutes really is all you should do at one time.\n\nBecause my knots are so deep and intense, I used to just keep the massager going for two or three cycles, hoping that I could release the tension completely all in one sitting. But I would always end up with bruises, leaving me in even more discomfort for the days (and sometimes entire weeks) following. I have since learned my lesson, and even though I'm always tempted to let it go for a second cycle, I only use it for 20 minutes a day.\n\nZyllion\n\nYou don't have to have severe tension to enjoy using this massager. Regardless of how chronic your discomfort is, you might find that this is the perfect way to just release some stress at the end of the day.", "description": "About two years ago, I got this shiatsu massager on Amazon for $49.95 and it's been a complete godsend for my shoulders and back.", "authors": ["Sally Kaplan"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b07114f1ae66243008b4658-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
