We can talk, but Iran\u2019s not getting any sanctions relief until it stops lying and spreading terror\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nIran announces it is injecting uranium into advanced centrifuges\n\nThe detaining of the vessel by UK authorities became a flash point in tensions between Iran, the US and the EU as the Middle Eastern state looks to fight back against tough sanctions levied by Washington after the breakdown of the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nIn an apparent show of retaliation for the Adrian Darya\u2019s detention in Gibraltar, Iran seized a British-flagged tanker, the Stena Impero, two weeks later for alleged marine violations. So far the state has released seven of the ship\u2019s crew, with a further 16 still left aboard.\n\nAnd on Saturday the Iranian coast guard seized a vessel carrying 284,000 litres of diesel for allegedly smuggling fuel in the Gulf, detaining 12 crew members from the Philippines in the process.\n\nThe nation has been fighting rampant smuggling heightened by the decline of the Iranian Rial and the low price of fuel brought about by heavy state subsidies introduced to keep the nation competitive amidst international pressure.\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Iran announces it is injecting uranium into advanced centrifuges", "description": "An Iranian tanker that sparked a diplomatic standoff between Tehran and western states has been spotted off the coast of Syria according to US officials \u2013 despite assurances the vessel would not deliver its 2.1 million barrels of crude oil to the country.British royal marine commandos had previously", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/v33_UEGvAmqxwYc8N2SQdQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/e127484a3cf210f7f70cbdba6b38a5e6", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
