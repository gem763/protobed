Police Department and obtained by Fox News alleges that the city, the police department and Lieutenant Jeff Price \u201cacted with negligence and bad faith\u201d while carrying out their investigation.\n\nPrice helmed the search for the missing Mouseketeer and is alleged by Day\u2019s family to have \u201chad access to and possession of all evidence sufficient to lead the investigating officer to find Mr. Day\u2019s deceased body.\" However, a letter sent by attorney Erin E. Gould claims Price knowingly made false statements about the investigation that stifled any ability to solve the case and begin prosecution of a suspect in a timely manner.\n\nHUMAN REMAINS FOUND AT HOME OF DENNIS DAY, ORIGINAL MOUSEKETEER MISSING FOR MONTHS\n\n\u201cDue to the City of Phoenix Police Department and Lieutenant Jeff Price's negligence, neglect, and failure to conduct an investigation at even a minimum professional standard, Mr. Day's body was found in April 2019 and not identified until June 2019,\u201d read the claim. \u201cWorse, Lieutenant Jeff Price made statements that certain investigative tools were used in the Summer of 2018, such as cadaver sniffing dogs, which were knowingly false and further delayed the investigation.\u201d\n\nWhile Day was last seen alive around July 15, 2018, the notice claims he contacted police days earlier to report that live-in handyman Daniel Burda, had \u201cbehaved violently toward him\u201d and asked for advice on how he could have Burda removed from the home.\n\nORIGINAL MICKEY MOUSE CLUB MOUSEKETEER DENNIS DAY WAS 'RECLUSIVE' BEOFRE HE WENT MISSING, LIEUTENANT SAYS\n\nDay was advised that he would need to formally evict Burda from the home if Burda was an official tenant.\n\nDay was reported missing two weeks after his husband, 88-year-old Henry Caswell, was hospitalized following a number of falls in their home. Not long after Day disappeared, 36-year-old Burda was questioned by Phoenix police and was observed on police body-camera footage with \u201cobvious defense wounds on his hands and forearms.\u201d\n\nIn August 2018, Phoenix police received a number of 911 calls reporting a \u201chorrific smell\u201d coming from Day\u2019s residence. One of the reports was made by a Meals on Wheels volunteer who delivered food to the residence.\n\nOver the next six months, the claim alleges that police \u201ctook no substantive action to attempt to locate Mr. Day despite abundant and obvious evidence that his deceased body was decaying in the Pine Street house and that Mr. Burda was responsible for his death.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Pine Street house is located a mere four blocks, or .3 miles, from the police station in a dense residential area in downtown Phoenix,\u201d the notice claims.\n\n2 OREGON WOMEN ACCUSED OF STEALING FROM A DEAD MOUSEKETEER\n\nBurda, a man with a lengthy rap sheet, was not arrested in connection with Day's disappearance and death until July 5 of this year, after the investigation had been turned over to the Oregon State Police. Price indicated on the \u201cVanished\u201d podcast that he never arrested the handyman because he didn\u2019t believe Burda would \u201cstick around\u201d the Phoenix area after killing Day, the notice claims.\n\nBurda was charged with manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, abuse of a corpse, criminal mistreatment and identity theft, state police said at the time.\n\nAccording to the Oregonian newspaper, Burda told investigators after his arrest that he pushed Day to the floor and later concealed his body under a pile of clothes. The claim states that police \u201chad stepped on, during three separate searches, causing multiple post mortal skeletal fractures and still did not find him.\u201d\n\nPOLICE STYMIED AS ORIGINAL MICKEY MOUSE CLUB MOUSEKETEER DENNIS DAY MISSING SINCE JULY\n\nThe local outlet reported, citing court documents, that Burda indicated that he attempted to air out the residence with Day\u2019s remains still inside \u201cbecause it smelled like death.\u201d He also allegedly tried multiple chemical solutions to clean the area.\n\nIn June, two women from southern Oregon were arrested and charged with felony theft of a car and jewelry belonging to Day after his 1990s Ford Escort was discovered about 200 miles away from his home. At the time, Price told Fox News there was no evidence that a crime had been committed.\n\nThe family\u2019s claim notice further alleges that they weren\u2019t notified of Day\u2019s disappearance until January 2019 after a local news report covered the case.\n\n\u201cAt that point, the heirs applied pressure to the Phoenix Police Department to enlist the help of state police,\u201d the claim read. \u201cOnce state police were involved and cadaver dogs were sent to the house, Mr. Day\u2019s decomposed body was found. The body was sent to a lab and later identified months later to in fact be Mr. Day.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlthough police have not yet reached a determination of Day's cause of death, a judge determined last month that Burda was mentally unfit to stand trial and committed him to the Oregon State Hospital.\n\n\u201cAt this point, proper justice for the death of Mr. Day will not be served, all due to the fact that the City of Phoenix Police and Lieutenant Price handled the missing person investigation with gross negligence and bad faith,\u201d the claim notice alleges.\n\nThe Phoenix Police Department did not respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.", "description": "Police investigating the disappearance and subsequent death of original Mickey Mouse Club Mouseketeer Dennis Day\u00a0have been\u00a0accused of repeatedly walking\u00a0on\u00a0a pile of clothing that concealed the 76-year-old's remains, causing skeletal fractures.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/03/01/694940094001_6008961740001_6008962857001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
