Photos: Kenneth Chan\n\nMatthew Chadwick has overcome a virus that cost him a Class Two winner on the weekend and says he won\u2019t be dwelling on the past ahead of his return to the saddle at Happy Valley on Wednesday night.\n\nChadwick had to forfeit six rides on Saturday and watched on as Keith Yeung Ming-lun piloted Savvy Six to victory, but his focus is firmly on getting the best out of a couple of horses he thinks are a good chance on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA winner is a winner but I\u2019m not worried about it because I wasn\u2019t at my best. The main thing is I\u2019m recovering. There is no point looking back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI had a bit of a virus but I\u2019m in the recovery stage and as long as I haven\u2019t got a fever I will be fine to ride. I\u2019ve just got a bit of a sore throat now.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019ve only got three rides but a couple can run decent races so I\u2019m going in with a positive attitude.\u201d\n\nChadwick\u2019s best chance looks to be in the night\u2019s final event \u2013 the Class Three High Island Handicap (1,650m) \u2013 with Acclaimed Light stepping out for the first time this season for in-form trainer Paul O\u2019Sullivan.\n\nThe seven-year-old trialled nicely on October 4 to finish within a length of Thanks Forever and ended last season strongly with a win in Class Four and a third in Class Three.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very consistent horse. I trialled him at Conghua and again at Sha Tin and he went through the gears and seems to be ticking over nicely,\u201d Chadwick said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s come back well and he\u2019s nice and fresh, hopefully we can get a nice run from gate two. He\u2019s lovely to ride and hopefully he can bring all his good work from the track to the racecourse.\u201d\n\nChadwick also teams up with Manfred Man Ka-leung\u2019s last-start winner Compassion Star, who steps up in grade for the Class Four Tai Lam Chung Handicap (1,200m).\n\nChadwick hasn\u2019t ridden the horse before and knows he\u2019ll have to be on his game to combat barrier 10.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s won in the grade previously but the gate is not going to be helpful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be very interesting to see how the race is run, it looks like it\u2019s going to be a bit of a messy race so it could be a headache from an outside gate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see how he jumps and try to slot in somewhere. He looks like he\u2019s got a decent turn of foot.\u201d\n\nChadwick\u2019s third ride also comes for O\u2019Sullivan in the form of the unremarkable Mehboob, who failed to finish better than seventh in four starts in his debut season.\n\n\u201cLast season he showed a bit of promise but he wasn\u2019t finishing his races off,\u201d the jockey said. \u201cTowards the end of last season we thought he was getting better and we tweaked a few things with him but he didn\u2019t turn up on race day.\n\n\u201cMaybe with a break during the off-season he has come back a bit better but only time will tell. He trialled OK but he\u2019s done that before in a trial.\u201d", "description": "Matthew Chadwick has overcome a virus that cost him a Class Two winner on the weekend and says he won\u2019t be dwelling on the past ahead of his return to the saddle at Happy Valley on Wednesday night....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/700x400/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/14/87c13036-ee53-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_163714.JPG?itok=iH3E66uM&v=1571042242", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
