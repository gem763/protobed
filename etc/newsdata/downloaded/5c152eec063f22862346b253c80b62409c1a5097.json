In 2011, after Epstein had been released from a Florida jail, it was an exclusive gathering, dominated by tech industry leadership. A gallery of photos taken at the event by Nathan Myhrvold, formerly Microsoft\u2019s chief technology officer, named 20 guests, including just one media representative: New York Times columnist David Brooks.\n\nEpstein wasn\u2019t named in the photos posted on the Edge website, but he appears in the background of a snap of Zack Bogue, a venture capitalist and husband of Marissa Mayer, then a vice president at Google. (The New York Times mentioned this photo in passing in its July story about Epstein\u2019s reentry into powerful social circles after his release from jail.)", "description": "", "authors": ["Buzzfeednews.Com Article Peteraldhous Jeffrey-Epstein-Bezos-Musk-Billionaires-Dinner"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
