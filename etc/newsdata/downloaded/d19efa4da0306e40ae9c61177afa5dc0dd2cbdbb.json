Competition among battery producers in Europe is intensifying and there are concerns over a potential shortage of qualified labor in Skellefte\u00e5.\n\n\u201cIt felt fantastic when we heard the factory would be built here,\u201d said Kristina Sundin Jonsson, head of administration for the municipality. \u201cBut we also understood that there was a lot of hard work still to do.\u201d\n\nNorthvolt, a three-year-old company founded by two former Tesla executives, is building Europe\u2019s largest battery plant in a massive clearing in the woods a couple of kilometers from the town center. At the factory construction site, 40,000 trees have been cut down and stacked along the dusty access road. Within secure fences, dozens of earth movers prepare the ground for what will be a building of between 400,000 square meters and 500,000 square meters.\n\nThe Northvolt investment comes at a pivotal moment for the battery industry as it seeks to meet demand from a transport sector switching from fossil fuels to electric power. Volkswagen alone estimates that it will need 150 gigawatt hours of batteries by 2025 \u2014 about five times more than the anticipated production capacity of the Northvolt factory.\n\nBeyond the new jobs, the arrival of Northvolt will have a huge impact on infrastructure in Skellefte\u00e5.\n\nAnnual electric car sales are expected to rise from 2 million in 2018 to 10 million in 2025 and 56 million by 2040, according to an estimate by the research company Bloomberg NEF.\n\nKey to the transition will be battery technology, the supply of which is currently dominated by companies from China, Japan and South Korea.\n\nLocation, location, location\n\nWith its Swedish factory, Northvolt is aiming to meet demand from European carmakers for batteries produced near the rest of their manufacturing operations. The Skellefte\u00e5 factory will produce 8 GWh of batteries annually by 2020, rising to 32 GWh by 2023.\n\nPaolo Cerruti, Northvolt\u2019s chief operating officer, who founded the company with CEO Peter Carlsson in 2016, said that for European carmakers, shipping batteries from Asia is seen as higher risk because any loss or damage en route would be both expensive and have a knock-on effect on the rest of their production.\n\n\u201cThe transportation industry is pushing for localization,\u201d he told POLITICO. \u201cIf you are a car company, you want your production as close as possible.\u201d\n\nEuropean officials have also been pushing to create battery-producing champions \u2014 worried that the EU's crucial car industry will lose its technical edge to Asian rivals. The European Investment Bank recently committed \u20ac350 million in loans to Northvolt.\n\n\u201cThe development of a competitive and green battery value chain within Europe can not only cut greenhouse gas emissions by decarbonizing power generation and transport, but can also help protect millions of well-paid jobs in European industries in the face of increasing global competition,\u201d EIB Vice President Andrew McDowell said after the loan was approved in May.\n\nVolkswagen has agreed to invest \u20ac900 million in Northvolt, securing a 20 percent stake and a seat on the board, in a deal to support both Northvolt's Swedish factory and a new venture between the two companies to develop batteries at a factory in northern Germany.\n\nThat underlines that Skellefte\u00e5 isn\u2019t the only player in this game.\n\nBeyond the new jobs, the arrival of Northvolt will have a huge impact on infrastructure in Skellefte\u00e5.\n\nCentral Europe, with its lower costs, is turning into a hub of battery manufacturing thanks to Asian investments. France and Germany are also seeking ways to encourage battery factories in their home countries. Tesla could be interested in setting up production facilities in Germany, reports suggest \u2014 and that's a lot closer to car plants than Skellefte\u00e5, lying about 800 kilometers north of Stockholm.\n\nBut officials in Skellefte\u00e5 are keen to point out the advantages to Northvolt of locating there.\n\nThe area has access to abundant clean energy, cheap building land, and nearby mines in northern Sweden and Finland that can supply some of the metals needed in battery production such as nickel and cobalt. The town owns Skellefte\u00e5 Kraft, an energy company that can supply enough hydroelectric power to meet all of Northvolt\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cWe have all these qualities that we knew would attract new industry,\u201d Sundin Jonsson said. \u201cAnd we were very proactive and offered solutions.\u201d\n\nExpansion limits\n\nHowever, there are concerns about how the town will be able to supply the roughly 2,500 workers the factory will need.\n\nWith a population of only 32,000 and no university, Skellefte\u00e5 is short of the large numbers of engineers and technicians Northvolt will need. To address this, hiring fairs are already underway across Sweden.\n\nCerruti said he expects around half the factory\u2019s staff to be recruited locally and half from elsewhere.\n\nBeyond the new jobs, the arrival of Northvolt will have a huge impact on infrastructure in Skellefte\u00e5. New roads and housing have to be built and rail links and the coastal harbor will be upgraded.\n\nWhile the mood in the town is largely upbeat about Northvolt, locals are also well aware that things don\u2019t always go as planned with large industrial projects.\n\nIn the town of Pajala in the far north of Sweden, a large iron ore mine, which was supposed to be the future of the area, collapsed after prices on commodity markets plunged. Across the Gulf of Bothnia in Finland, the effect of the decline of Nokia\u2019s phonemaking operations on the town of Salo is well-documented.\n\n\u00c5ke Andersson, an 81-year-old retired music teacher, cycled up from his home in a nearby suburb to check on progress at the building site. He said it is hard to take in the scale of the project or truly understand the prospects for battery production.\n\n\u201cI hope someone doesn\u2019t invent some other kind of fuel in the meantime,\u201d he said.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
