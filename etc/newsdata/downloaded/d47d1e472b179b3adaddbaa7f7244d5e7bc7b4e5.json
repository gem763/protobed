Sondland \u201ckept talking about it,\u201d said a fellow Bush donor, adding that \u201c2016 was not turning out remotely as we had expected.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTo realize his goal, Sondland made a political about-face and backed Donald Trump, a candidate he once said was out of touch with his \u201cpersonal beliefs and values on so many levels.\u201d After the election, Sondland contributed $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural. And he began calling in political favors \u2014 including from Republican National Committee chairman-turned-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus \u2014 to convince Trump that he could be a team player.\n\nAD\n\nNow, the lengths to which Sondland would go to impress Trump \u2014 and to advance the president\u2019s agenda in Ukraine as U.S. ambassador to the European Union \u2014 have made him a central figure in the congressional impeachment inquiry. Sondland is scheduled to testify under subpoena this week before House investigators.\n\nOf particular interest is Sondland\u2019s work over the summer with U.S. diplomats in Kiev and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. Together, they pressed Ukrainian leaders to issue a public statement committing to investigating corruption at a Ukrainian energy company. The move would have tarnished the character of Trump\u2019s potential 2020 rival, former vice president Joe Biden, whose son served on the company\u2019s board. The Washington Post reported Saturday that Sondland plans to testify that he understood that, in exchange for the statement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would receive a coveted invitation to visit the White House.\n\nAD\n\nCurrent and former U.S. officials and foreign diplomats say Sondland seemed to believe that if he delivered for Trump in Ukraine he could ascend in the ranks of government. A person close to Sondland disputed that notion, but other officials said Sondland had been talked about in the administration as a possible successor to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe spent a year trying to prove that he wasn\u2019t anti-Trump,\u201d said a former White House official who watched Sondland\u2019s role evolve. \u201cHe got into the position [of ambassador], and he had an opportunity to prove it. Trump knew that he wanted to prove his loyalty.\u201d\n\nThis story is based on more than three dozen interviews with diplomats in the United States and abroad, current and former government officials, and associates and confidants of Sondland. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation or were discussing sensitive diplomatic topics.\n\nAD\n\nSondland, 62, declined through an attorney to comment. But his wife, Katherine Durant, criticized coverage of her husband, saying in an interview that only those motivated by self-interest were speaking. Durant has mostly remained in Portland during Sondland\u2019s posting abroad, she said, helping to run the hotel business he founded. She said she fears an economic backlash against the hotel company. Already a prominent local company has cut ties with Provenance Hotels, and a Democratic congressman, Earl Blumenauer, has called for a boycott until Sondland cooperates fully in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe live in a world right now where there\u2019s no upside to supporting someone like Gordon who is working for Trump; it\u2019s a mob,\u201d Durant said.\n\nDurant said her husband deserves a fair hearing: \u201cHe\u2019s been extremely hard-working. He came from immigrant parents; he\u2019s first generation here; he made his own wealth; he\u2019s worked his entire life hard, he\u2019s extremely generous. I mean, he\u2019ll sit down and listen to anyone, take his time, go to bat for them, give his money. But this environment is so sad and vicious that there is no one who will stick up for him. I find it really pathetic.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA collector of relationships\n\nIn March 2016, shortly after the phone call from Bush, which was described by two people with knowledge of it, Sondland was the headliner at the Portland Business Journal\u2019s monthly Power Breakfast.\n\nAD\n\nMore than 400 business leaders gathered in a ballroom at 7 a.m. Sondland took the microphone and began recounting his rags-to-riches tale.\n\nIn Sondland\u2019s telling, the story begins with his teenage parents fleeing Nazi Germany. His mother makes her way to Uruguay, while her father ends up fighting with the French Foreign Legion in North Africa. The two stay in touch through letters delivered by the Red Cross. They reunite after six years and make their way to Seattle, where they run a dry-cleaning business. Sondland is raised on Mercer Island, now an exclusive area east of downtown but one that in the 1960s and 1970s was more of a melting pot.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEveryone mixed in the same high school,\u201d Sondland recalled, \u201cso that created a lot of aspirational emotions when you saw some kids showing up on their 16th birthday with the new BMW that their parents had bought them, and some kids had to walk or take the bus.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt created a lot of interesting dynamics that probably followed me for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nSondland found success in business at an early age. At 28, as a commercial real estate broker, he was analyzing whether his firm should become the listing agent for a hotel in bankruptcy. Reviewing the company\u2019s financials, Sondland saw an opportunity. He decided to look for investors and buy it himself instead. It was the start of what would become Provenance Hotels, a boutique chain with more than a dozen properties throughout the country.\n\nAD\n\nAs the company grew, Sondland and Durant became known as major philanthropists in Portland. They donated millions of dollars to medical research, homeless programs and the arts, including endowing in perpetuity free admission to the Portland Art Museum for anyone under 18.\n\nAD\n\nBut increasingly, his wife said, Sondland\u2019s obsession was politics. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re into, but his sports, his golf, it\u2019s all politics,\u201d Durant said. \u201cHe loves it.\u201d\n\nA lifelong Republican, Sondland became a \u201cbundler\u201d \u2014 a political fundraiser who collects contributions from other donors and then directs large, six-to-seven-figure donations to campaigns. He backed Mitt Romney and John McCain that way.\n\nAD\n\nSondland also has donated smaller sums to Democrats, particularly at the state level. Widening his network of wealthy donors seemed almost like a hobby for Sondland, said David Nierenberg, an investment adviser in Washington state who has known Sondland for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cSome people collect cars. Some people collect wine, collect books. Gordon collects relationships \u2014 and relationships with people who are active in public life are very important to him,\u201d Nierenberg said.\n\nAD\n\nWhile the two men were raising money for Romney, Sondland told Nierenberg that he had expressed interest in a potential ambassadorship. He hoped to follow the path of two previous political fundraisers from the area who had been rewarded with ambassadorships by President George W. Bush: Charles \u201cButch\u201d Swindells and Bill McCormick, of the seafood restaurant chain McCormick & Schmick\u2019s.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGordon indicated to me . . . that it would be of interest to him to go to a German-speaking country, like Germany or Austria, since it would be a full circle\u201d for him as a child of Holocaust survivors, Nierenberg said.\n\nSondland\u2019s hoped-for path was also clear to Oregon developer Jordan Schnitzer, a Democratic donor and a longtime friend. Sondland became \u201cvery enamored\u201d with the jet-setting lives of McCormick and Swindells, Schnitzer said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGordon was very close to those people, and I think he admired the fact that they were ambassadors,\u201d Schnitzer said. \u201cSo for a number of years, it\u2019s been clear for many of us he wanted to become an ambassador, therefore he became very generous with his political contributions.\u201d\n\n'Always a quid pro quo'\n\nAs a Republican in the majority-Democrat Pacific Northwest, Sondland developed an understanding of what he considered the transactional nature of bipartisan politics.\n\nIn the early 2000s, his financial support to the campaigns of George W. Bush helped put him on the radar for a modest appointment to the President\u2019s Commission on White House Fellowships. At the same time, his support for the Democratic governor of Oregon, Ted Kulongoski, led to an appointment as head of the Governor\u2019s Office of Film & Television.\n\n\u201cThe governor knew I had a relationship with the Bush White House and asked me to work on myriad projects,\u201d Sondland told the Portland Business Journal\u2019s breakfast audience. \u201cAs things came up . . . we would make these requests and they were done quietly. They were done with rifle precision and there was always a quid pro quo: The governor would help the president with something, and the president would help the governor with something. And it was very transactional.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the breakfast, Sondland had not yet gone all in on Trump \u2014 a reversal that was in its own way transactional and that followed a path many other establishment Republicans also have taken.\n\nIn August 2016, Sondland and his business partner, Bashar Wali, took their names off a scheduled Trump fundraiser, after the candidate belittled the parents of Humayun Khan, a Muslim soldier slain in Iraq while serving in the U.S. Army.\n\nTheir company issued a public statement noting Sondland\u2019s parents\u2019 flight from Germany and Wali\u2019s emigration from Syria. \u201cIn light of Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of the Khan family and the fact his constantly evolving positions diverge from their personal beliefs and values on so many levels, neither Mr. Sondland or Mr. Wali can support his candidacy,\u201d the statement concluded.\n\nRob Freres, the president of an Oregon timber company who had been on the receiving end of Sondland\u2019s fundraising pitches, wondered whether Sondland was trying to protect his business empire, especially since a Trump victory still seemed unlikely.\n\n\u201cI thought that [because of] where he is in the hotel business, it was just prudent for him to back away because of the threats or bodily harm, or vandalism of his properties,\u201d Freres said.\n\nSondland\u2019s approach changed after Election Day. While he still didn\u2019t publicly support Trump in Portland, where opposition to the new president was already prompting street protests, Sondland donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee through four entities, including limited liability companies, state and federal records show. The contributions made him one of the top 50 donors to a record-setting inaugural haul of $107 million.\n\nWhen the donations were reported in 2017, \u201ceveryone in Portland was pretty bummed,\u201d said a business associate of Sondland\u2019s. \u201cGordon was cutthroat, no doubt, but he had done so many good things for Portland, this seemed like a betrayal.\u201d\n\nThose who knew his ambition for becoming an ambassador were less surprised.\n\n\u201cKnowing of Gordon\u2019s interest in having relationships with people in power, and knowing that he was sort of ecumenical about that \u2014 between Democrats and Republicans \u2014 no, I was not surprised,\u201d Nierenberg said.\n\nSondland\u2019s work to ingratiate himself with Trump was just beginning.\n\nSondland asked Priebus to recommend that he be appointed ambassador to the European Union, according to people knowledgeable about the exchange.\n\nInitially, Trump balked.\n\n\u201cHe had a hard time winning Trump\u2019s approval because he left Trump during the campaign,\u201d said a former White House official familiar with the president\u2019s reaction.\n\nSondland called on Trump\u2019s former campaign finance chairman, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who had invited former Bush donors to back Trump, to put in a good word, according to current and former White House officials. Sondland also sought the backing of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, arranging a private dinner with them, officials said.\n\nTo some in Trump\u2019s inner circle, Sondland\u2019s ambition seemed transparent.\n\n\u201cHe was clamoring to be an ambassador. He gave a ton of money. He worked year after year,\u201d one official said. \u201cHe likes to go to events, to be seen, to feel like he\u2019s in the room.\u201d\n\nEventually, Trump decided Sondland was on his team. He announced the nomination on May 10, 2018.\n\nA 'disruptive diplomat'\n\nThe role of U.S. ambassador to the European Union has long been considered one of the most \u201cnerdy\u201d jobs in the State Department, according to past officeholders. People with previous government experience or skilled lawyers from the private sector have been tapped for the technocratic job of finding ways to build coalitions to advance American interests.\n\nCulturally, past ambassadors have taken care to learn the lingo of Brussels, where it is assumed diplomats will understand that \u201ccomitology\u201d refers to how the E.U. modifies its laws and that the \u201cEuropean Semester\u201d is when E.U. countries coordinate their budgets with the bloc. Significantly, the ambassador\u2019s portfolio typically has included Europe-wide energy issues, including gas supplies that run in pipelines through Ukraine.\n\nSondland came in with boisterous self-confidence and a conspicuous style. From the day he arrived in Brussels, the office\u2019s official Twitter account chronicled his every handshake and salute. He posted a YouTube video of him and his family, at home, making coffee and sitting on a couch introducing himself to his European audience.\n\nIn public appearances and in private meetings, Sondland often came off like a version of Trump with the roughest edges sanded off, according to diplomats who interacted with him. He once declared to American business representatives that unlike his predecessors he would \u201cget s--- done,\u201d according to people who were present. He called the European Union \u201cout of touch\u201d and accused it of stalling on trade talks with the Trump administration. And he called himself a \u201cdisruptive diplomat.\u201d\n\nFrom the outset, Sondland\u2019s ambition was clear, as was his fondness for the trappings of the job, said several who interacted with him.\n\nHe began updating the U.S. ambassador\u2019s baronial residence on the leafy outskirts of Brussels, an effort that was still underway last week, according to a guard who said the residence was closed for extensive renovations. Contracts went out for tens of thousands of dollars in new furniture, $25,000 to an American rug company, and as much for the services of a custom woodwork and case maker, federal procurement records show.\n\nIt was \u201creal 18th century Jefferson-in-Paris behavior,\u201d a senior U.S. official said.\n\nA person who has spoken to Sondland about the upgrades said the residence was \u201cnearly unusable for representational purposes,\u201d and renovations were a less costly alternative to a planned purchase of new mission facility, initially proposed during the Obama administration.\n\nEarly on, Sondland tried to invite the European Union\u2019s top officials \u2014 heads of state \u2014 to dine at the residence. The request raised eyebrows on the European side, officials said at the time, because ambassadors, even American ones, usually aim lower in the pecking order as a matter of protocol.\n\nAt dinners and elsewhere, Sondland was aggressive in echoing Trump\u2019s rhetoric, telling people that Europe had been taking advantage of the United States on trade for decades and sometimes punctuating his speech with four-letter words.\n\nIn June, at a dinner with U.S. and European officials, Sondland was seated across a table from Baroness Catherine Ashton, a former E.U. foreign policy chief.\n\nAccording to two people who observed the encounter, he spoke at length about American generosity after World War II and how it paved the way for the continent\u2019s current prosperity. He asked why Europeans were not more appreciative, the observers said, and why his requests were so frequently rebuffed.\n\nAshton politely told him that the United States had also benefited from Europe\u2019s prosperity, said two American guests who observed the exchange. She did not return calls seeking comment.\n\nA few months into his posting, Sondland and Schnitzer were vacationing at their beach homes in Gearhart, Ore., Schnitzer said. Sondland spoke about the challenges of navigating governmental bureaucracies and bemoaned what he saw as inefficiency, Schnitzer said.\n\nBut Sondland added that he \u201cgot to meet all these European leaders and he was often on first-name basis with them, even though you\u2019re supposed to address them as \u2018president this or president that.\u2019 He said, \u2018I could address them by their first name,\u2019 \u201d Schnitzer said. \u201cI took it as he was building a number of impressive relationships.\u201d\n\nA special assignment\n\nIn recent months, Sondland\u2019s deep involvement in a new administration in Ukraine struck diplomats in Brussels and Washington as highly unusual, given his role as envoy to the European Union, a large political bloc that does not include Ukraine.\n\nIn July, on a visit to the former Soviet republic, Sondland told a Ukrainian broadcaster that Trump \u201chas not only honored me with the job of being the U.S. ambassador to the E.U. but he\u2019s also given me other special assignments including Ukraine.\u201d\n\nSondland plans to tell Congress this week that the roots of the confounding task in Ukraine began in May, according to a person familiar with the testimony. Sondland attended the inauguration that month of Zelensky.\n\nIn an Oval Office meeting afterward, Sondland intends to say, Trump told him, special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry that any face-to-face meeting he would entertain with the new Ukrainian president would have to be cleared by Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney.\n\nSondland plans to say that over the following weeks, he and Volker, along with the acting ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor, learned that as a condition of such a meeting, Giuliani was demanding Zelensky\u2019s administration publicly announce it would tackle corruption, including singling out as a target Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company linked to Biden\u2019s son.\n\nText messages that Volker has turned over to Congress show the three struggling to negotiate the details of that statement with Ukrainian officials.\n\nVolker writes most often. Taylor frequently expresses concern. Sondland on at least one occasion appeared to speak for Trump\u2019s interests, writing on Aug. 9 that \u201cpotus really wants the deliverable.\u201d\n\nVolker did not respond to messages seeking comment for this story. Taylor declined to comment.\n\nGiuliani last week told The Post that Sondland \u201cseemed to be in charge\u201d of the overall effort. He said that Volker first raised the idea of getting the Ukrainians to issue a statement, and that Volker and Sondland were involved in the specifics of getting Ukraine to name Burisma.\n\n\u201cI said it should include collusion and Burisma,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible we never mentioned Biden. Of course, Biden was part of that.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said Sondland and Volker were often on conference calls together and that Sondland was keeping tabs on Giuliani\u2019s work on the effort, speaking with him about six times over the summer.\n\nBut according to the person with knowledge of Sondland\u2019s testimony, Giuliani had the more central role. Volker, Taylor and Sondland were all just trying to \u201cunderstand through Rudy what the president\u2019s concerns were and to try to address them,\u201d the person said.\n\nSondland plans to say he was unaware until a whistleblower\u2019s complaint became public late last month that Biden\u2019s son Hunter had been a Burisma board member and that some government officials suspected Trump\u2019s goal was to tarnish the character of a potential 2020 Democratic challenger. In their discussions, Giuliani never mentioned the Biden connection, the person with knowledge of Sondland\u2019s testimony said.\n\nSondland could face skeptical questioning on this point. In televised appearances, Giuliani had by then repeatedly raised concerns over Hunter Biden\u2019s role at Burisma, and numerous newspaper and magazine articles had questioned whether the issue could prove to be a drag on his father\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nHe is also likely to be pressed on his own interactions with Trump. The person close to Sondland said the ambassador spoke to Trump maybe \u201csix or seven\u201d times in the course of the Ukraine negotiations, though not about the statement sought by the administration.\n\nLast month, after speaking with the president by phone, Sondland sent a key text message. It said Trump wants \u201cno quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d Trump and his supporters have held up the text as proof that none was ever considered.\n\nThe person with knowledge of Sondland\u2019s testimony said Sondland took Trump at his word at the time, but that he has no knowledge of whether the president\u2019s statement was true, as he only learned details such as the importance of the Biden mention from the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nNierenberg, Sondland\u2019s acquaintance from Portland, said he sent him an email recently urging that in the impeachment inquiry Sondland \u201ctell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\u201d\n\nNierenberg said Sondland wrote back thanking him for the advice.", "description": "The lengths to which the former GOP fundraiser would go to impress Trump \u2014 and to advance his Ukraine agenda as ambassador to the E.U. \u2014 are a likely focus of his scheduled testimony in the House this week.", "authors": ["Aaron C.
