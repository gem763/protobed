It\u2019s failing our most vulnerable residents and pushing them into hardship.\n\n\"It\u2019s simply not good enough that these blunders continue.\"\n\nDeputy Mayor Rachel Blake added: \"The continuing errors we are seeing due to Universal Credit show it\u2019s not fit for purpose.\n\n(Image: The Wharf)\n\n\"It\u2019s impossible for our residents to budget when they are being regularly underpaid or suddenly hit with bill for overpayments.\"\n\nCases reported by Tower Hamlets included a single parent in temporary accommodation, who waited eight months for payment because of a spat between the council and the DWP over who was responsible for paying them.\n\nIn another case, the DWP handed more than \u00a35,000 to a claimant after it took three months to resolve a dispute about their housing and child costs in Universal Credit.\n\nOther cases led to people being paid too much in benefits.\n\nTower Hamlets officials claimed they told DWP four times about someone who was being paid UC and housing benefit at the same time. By the time the issue was resolved five months later, the claimant had been overpaid by \u00a312,000.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIn another case, officers identified what they claimed was an \"obvious contrived tenancy between family members\", but it took four notifications and \u00a318,000 overpayments before the DWP stopped the right element of housing benefit.\n\nTower Hamlets said it identified 578 errors in cases in 2018/19.\n\nDespite the council going public about the first set this spring, 150 further alleged errors were identified up to September - making 728 in total since the work began.\n\nNot all the cases are proven errors or accepted as errors by the DWP, as they were resolved in different ways without a consistent paper trail.\n\nA DWP spokesman said: \"There are almost 17,000 people receiving Universal Credit in Tower Hamlets and more than 2 million across the UK in total, and we continue to provide the best support possible to every single claimant.\n\n\"If a mistake is made on someone\u2019s benefit payment, staff work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Labour-run Tower Hamlets demanded the DWP halt the benefit's rollout after compiling the figures for 18 months", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Getty Images", "The Wharf", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13400435.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Latest-Figures-Show-UK-Unemployment-Has-Risen-Above-2-Million.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
