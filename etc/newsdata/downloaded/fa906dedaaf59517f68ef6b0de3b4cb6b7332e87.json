The final results will be published in a journal later this year.\n\nAlthough the volcano's eruption was violent, sending ash and plume nearly 8 miles into the air, there is no long-term danger, given its remote location, Kalnajs pointed out. But if the volcano had been in an area with a significant population, it could have had a different outcome.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important when major eruptions happen that we get data quickly,\u201d Kalnajs said. \u201cWe need to figure out if this is going to be the kind of thing that impacts hundreds of thousands of people around the world, or is going to be to be more minor?\u201d\n\nBut the purple skies show that even seemingly-isolated volcanic eruptions can have global consequences. \u201cA really big eruption would have a major impact on humanity, so it\u2019s something we need to be ready for,\u201d Kalnajs added.\n\nThe eruption of Raikoke was so powerful that it was captured by astronauts on the International Space Station in June. It sits on an uninhabited island in the Kuril Islands chain in the northwest Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe volcano most recently exploded in 1924 and in 1778.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Christopher Carbone contributed to this report.", "description": "Volcanic eruptions can often be devastating to nearby regions, but a remote volcano in Russia is responsible for some beautiful sunsets, according to researchers.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/purple-sunset.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
