The company is run by a former government official whom Ukrainian and British authorities would investigate for alleged criminal wrongdoing, including money laundering. The younger Mr. Biden\u2019s move drew criticism given that Ukraine is within his father\u2019s portfolio as vice president.\n\nHunter Biden Photo: Ron Sachs/Zuma Press\n\nDecember 2015: Vice President Biden visited Kiev, where he pressured the country to do a better job of rooting out widespread corruption and called for the \u201creform\u201d of the office of Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. Mr. Shokin had long been criticized by the U.S. and other countries for not doing enough to address corruption in Ukraine.\n\nMarch 29, 2016: Ukrainian Parliament voted to remove Mr. Shokin. By the time he left office, he was no longer pursuing the Burisma investigation. Jan. 23, 2018: Mr. Biden, speaking at a Council on Foreign Relations event, recounted a trip he took to Kiev as vice president after then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had promised and failed to \u201ctake action\u201d against the state prosecutor. Mr. Biden said he told Mr. Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold a $1 billion loan unless he ousted Mr. Shokin. \u201cI looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cWell, son of a bitch. He got fired.\u201d April 21, 2019: Mr. Zelensky elected as president of Ukraine.

April 28: Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani tweeted about investigations in Ukraine, charging that the \u201cmedia blackout of the investigations in Ukraine of alleged Democrat corruption\u201d proves there is a \u201cdouble standard.\u201d May 9: The New York Times reported that Rudy Giuliani planned to travel to Kiev to pressure the Ukrainian government to press ahead with investigations into Joe Biden and into possible interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Mr. Giuliani subsequently canceled the trip, which he says Mr. Trump knew about. May 16: Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general told Bloomberg that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden or his son. June: Mr. Giuliani met in Paris with an official from the Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s office to discuss a possible Biden investigation. July 21: Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Zelensky\u2019s party in parliamentary elections, cementing the political newcomer\u2019s power. July 25: Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky spoke by phone. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Mr. Trump urged Mr. Zelensky about eight times to talk to Mr. Giuliani about an investigation into Mr. Biden\u2019s son, according to people familiar with the matter. August: Mr. Giuliani met with Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Mr. Zelensky, in Madrid. The two also spoke by phone later in the month. Mr. Giuliani described Mr. Yermak as \u201cvery receptive\u201d and said the aide told him Mr. Zelensky would \u201cget to the bottom of all this.\u201d Late August: The Trump administration began reviewing $250 million in foreign aid to Ukraine, meant to help the country ward off Russia. Aug. 29: Mr. Trump canceled his planned trip to Poland to deal with Hurricane Dorian. He had been scheduled to meet with Mr. Zelensky there. Mr. Yermak later called Mr. Giuliani to ask whether the president\u2019s decision to cancel his trip was related to Mr. Zelensky; Mr. Giuliani says in an interview he assured him it wasn\u2019t. Sept. 12: The Trump administration released foreign aid to Ukraine. Sept. 25: Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky are expected to meet in person for the first time at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. The United Nations General Assembly gets under way.
