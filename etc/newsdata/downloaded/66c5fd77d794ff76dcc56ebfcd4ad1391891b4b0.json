Timed to coincide with the publication of Miller\u2019s memoir, Know My Name, it is a powerful riposte to the rape culture that enabled Miller\u2019s assault \u2013 and led many to blame her, the victim.\n\nAs is now seared into the memory of many, BuzzFeed took the unprecedented decision in 2016 \u2013 a full year before #MeToo prompted a tsunami of women to bear witness to their experiences of sexual abuse \u2013 to publish Miller\u2019s victim impact statement in full, which she had read in court the day Turner was sentenced.\n\nMiller\u2019s powerful account of the impact of Turner\u2019s crime went viral, garnering four million hits in just four days. It was also read live on air by CNN\u2019s host of Legal View, Ashleigh Banfield, and on the floor of the US Congress.\n\nStanford sexual assault survivor identifies herself before release of memoir Read more\n\nAs Bill Whitaker, the 60 Minutes journalist who interviewed Miller, described it, the statement became \u201ca manifesto\u201d for sexual assault survivors all over the world. Many will never forget the first line: \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, but you\u2019ve been inside me, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the impact of Miller\u2019s decision to allow BuzzFeed to publish the statement and the publication\u2019s interest in publishing it in the first place cannot be underestimated. They have helped reverse a long-term trend in media reporting of violence against women that often blames the victim, renders the perpetrator invisible, or foregrounds his feelings and the impact the crime has had on his life.\n\nFour years ago I worked for Our Watch, Australia\u2019s national foundation to prevent violence against women, where I established the national media engagement program to address precisely those issues. As part of that project, Our Watch commissioned the first national Australian study of media representations of violence against women, including a comprehensive analysis of the reporting of the 2015 Luke Lazarus rape trial, an Australian case with many striking similarities to that of Miller. The results of the study were alarming.\n\nThe research noted a \u201cdisproportionate focus on the accused compared to the complainant, including his family relations and the effect the case had on him and the associated muted and selective reporting of the victim impact statement\u201d. There was a strong tendency by the media as recently as four years ago to \u201cmute\u201d the victim impact statement and focus on the point of view of the alleged perpetrator.\n\nI\u2019m sure that research would be painfully familiar to Miller, who recounted in the 60 Minutes interview how she came to learn she had been sexually assaulted. Miller, who was unconscious at the time of the attack, woke up in a hospital emergency room after two Swedish graduate students scared off Turner in the midst of the attack, chased him down and held him until police could arrive. Ten days later, while Miller was at work, she came across a news story detailing Turner\u2019s arrest for sexual assault, with the media describing him as a \u201cstar swimmer\u201d with \u201cOlympic hopes\u201d, while she was the simply the \u201cintoxicated\u201d and \u201cunconscious\u201d victim.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I did after reading the article is read the comments and there were many, awful, hateful words,\u201d Miller told 60 Minutes. \u201cWhat was she doing at a frat party, this isn\u2019t really rape, why was she alone, why would you even get that drunk.\u201d\n\nMiller has written her memoir and decided to participate in media interviews revealing her identity because she is on a mission to combat the very rape myths and victim-blaming personified by those comments. \u201cRape is not a punishment for getting drunk \u2013 we have this really sick mindset in our culture that you \u2018deserve\u2019 rape if you drink to excess,\u201d she told 60 Minutes.\n\nThat point, and the damaging nature of the media reporting at the time of Turner\u2019s arrest and trial, were also stressed by the prosecutor in the case, Alaleh Kianerci, who spoke to 60 Minutes. \u201cA lot of people were looking at what Brock Turner had to lose instead of what he did to Chanel,\u201d said Kianerci.\n\nThankfully, that is slowly changing.\n\nHere in Australia, Saxon Mullins, the victim in the Lazarus case, which was the subject of the Our Watch study, also took the decision to waive her anonymity last year to speak to Louise Milligan for an ABC Four Corners special episode, I Am that Girl.\n\nJournalist and campaigner Nina Funnell launched the Let Her Speak campaign to repeal gag laws in Tasmania and the Northern Territory that prevent journalists from naming victims of sexual abuse, even with their consent. Funnell wanted to \u201chighlight why it is important survivor voices are included in public debates\u201d.\n\nAs Miller, Mullins and Funnell so powerfully demonstrate, victims who speak out can fundamentally change how we understand sexual assault, the culture that enables it and, most importantly, who should be held accountable. Hint: never the victim.\n\nTasmania sex assault gag law to face overhaul early next year Read more\n\nJust one caveat, which I was reminded of recently when Funnell posted an article on social media warning of the dangers of reducing women\u2019s stories of sexual abuse (and I intensely dislike using the word \u201cstory\u201d to describe women\u2019s experiences of abuse) to what some have called \u201cinspiration porn\u201d.\n\nIt is important to remember that there is so much more to these stories than an \u201cinspiring\u201d tale of the power of the human spirit to \u201covercome\u201d. These women are not overcoming what happened to them. Their experiences have shaped them. They have deeply uncomfortable truths to share. And they are advocating, successfully, for changes to deliver justice to victims and promote much-needed conversations about consent.\n\nSo yes, by all means pay tribute to their bravery. But more importantly, really listen to what they have to say \u2013 even if it is confronting.\n\nIf we are only ever \u201cinspired\u201d, than we are not doing it right. Having long been \u201cmuted\u201d, blamed and dismissed, survivors of sexual assault deserve nothing less than our full attention.\n\n\u2022 Kristine Ziwica is a Melbourne-based freelance writer", "description": "In waiving her anonymity, Stanford assault survivor Chanel Miller is upending victim-blaming narratives that heap sympathy on the perpetrator", "authors": ["Kristine Ziwica"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa71fd180f78296adf035df73c5a986d93718040/0_254_4090_2453/master/4090.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f99b8159ccc59f0bd9adc0bc4126203e", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
