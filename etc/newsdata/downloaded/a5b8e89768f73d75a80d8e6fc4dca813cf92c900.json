And those are only the ones I could see in the CCTV footage.\n\n\u201cAnd the pet hotel had the nerve to be upset with me, saying some of the cat owners weren\u2019t planning on having kittens. They wanted me to explain the situation to all the other owners.\n\n\u201cMy f***ing cat is now exhausted and on a glucose drip - and this is my fault?\u201d\n\nThe cat's owner later said the hotel apologised and offered to pay for the Russian Blue's fluid therapy.\n\n(Image: AsiaWire)\n\n(Image: AsiaWire)\n\nHe said: \u201cThey're going to compensate each pregnant cat\u2019s owner \u00a356 (500 RMB), and have promised to sell any kittens on their behalf.\n\n\u201cThe other owners have also told me they\u2019ll either give me a kitten or \u00a3113 (1,000 RMB) if their cats really turn out to be pregnant.\u201d\n\nA pedigreed Russian Blue can be worth anything between \u00a3350 to well over \u00a31,000.\n\nMr Zhao said Xiaopi has since regained his strength and is in stable condition.", "description": "Xiaopi was left in a pet hotel in Guangdong Province in South China by his owners for just one night", "authors": ["Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Asiawire"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20465697.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-AsiaWire-HornyCat-02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
