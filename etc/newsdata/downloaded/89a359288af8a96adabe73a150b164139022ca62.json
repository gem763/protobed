But Marvel is currently juggling multiple timelines, as \u201cBlack Widow\u201d will take place after the events of past Marvel installment \u201cCaptain America: Civil War,\u201d which means that Iron Man is still very much alive when the film begins.\n\nJohansson\u2019s character was also killed off in \u201cEndgame,\u201d which wrapped up more than a decade of storytelling for the movie studio, so her solo film could be the only opportunity for the two actors, who first shared the screen in \u201cIron Man 2,\u201d to appear together one last time.\n\nDowney Jr. is the linchpin of the MCU and could provide a much-needed bridge to the upcoming Phase 4 of film and TV projects as creators break new ground.\n\nDirected by Cate Shortland, \u201cBlack Widow\u201d will also star Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz, O-T Fagbenle and \u201cStranger Things\u201d actor David Harbour.", "description": "The actor will reportedly be reprising his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man in the prequel film starring Scarlett Johansson.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7ff3ad2300005805551a35.png?cache=hektaqkawe&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
