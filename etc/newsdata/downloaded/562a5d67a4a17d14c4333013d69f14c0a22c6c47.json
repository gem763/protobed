The highest level negotiations thus far since the two countries started lobbing full-scale tariffs at each other will take place tomorrow. Donald Trump announced a meeting with China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He on Twitter, but suggested he might not be all that eager to cut a deal. China has also sounded less than positive about the potential for a breakthrough:\n\nBig day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nThe U.S. and China have begun their principal-level negotiations in Washington on Thursday. Trump\u2019s comment about a meeting with Liu contrasted with a report from the South China Morning Post that said the two sides made no progress in deputy-level trade talks this week and Liu will cut his visit short. Stocks surged after the president\u2019s tweet, rebounding from a wild overnight session sparked by the SCMP article as well as multiple other media reports.\n\nSigns point to a potential change of direction. Rather than reach one overall settlement, the two countries might decide to make a series of targeted pacts where they can find agreement on trade issues:\n\nBloomberg News reported overnight that the White House is working up a partial deal to suspend next week\u2019s tariff increase in exchange for a currency pact. The New York Times also reported that the Trump administration is grant licenses for some U.S. companies to sell nonsensitive supplies to Chinese telecom giant Huawei.\n\nA deal on currency manipulation and Huawei would appear to be a balanced approach to each country\u2019s interests and leverage. That could unlock other parts of a broader set of agreements down the road as a confidence builder. It\u2019s not a bad place to start, but it doesn\u2019t dig deeply into the US\u2019 core issues of market access and intellectual-property protection, at least not yet.\n\nEven before Trump\u2019s tweet, rumors had floated about a potential trade deal with China. The Washington Post noted that investors got bullish yesterday afternoon after those rumors began to circulate, mainly leveraged off of the Bloomberg report. The Post also cast some doubt about Trump\u2019s reluctance to deal:\n\nWhether these escalating problems can be resolved during two days of talks is unclear, but the prolonged trade war has shown growing signs that it is causing problems for the economies in both countries. The Fed released the \u201cminutes\u201d of its September meeting on Wednesday, and the word \u201ctrade\u201d appeared in the discussion 28 times. It said, among other things, that \u201ctrade policy concerns continued to weigh on firms\u2019 investment decisions,\u201d a sign that companies were cutting back while they await a resolution of the White House standoff with China. Also Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the number of new job openings had fallen to its lowest level since March 2018. The labor market has cooled a bit this year but it has remained relatively strong. Any sign of weakening heading into the 2020 election could create problems for the White House.\n\nThe labor market has cooled considerably, although job losses have not increased \u2014 yet. One has to go back a full year to find a monthly jobs report where additions significantly increase past the maintenance level needed for population growth. Last month, wages stagnated for the first time in a couple of years, which is another indicator of a job-market stall on the horizon. Trump needs an economy shifting back into high gear well ahead of the election, and most certainly won\u2019t survive a recession or even a significant period of stagnation.\n\nSo yes, Trump needs a deal, but it can\u2019t just be any deal. He will have to show significant wins now, thanks to the length of the current trade war and the damage it\u2019s done to the agricultural sector especially. Farmers need to see immediate and significant benefits to keep them on board the Trump train.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the presence of Liu and Trump at the bargaining table would indicate some sort of agreement has already been reached. That may not be true with Trump, who likes to do the negotiating himself, but it\u2019s at least an indication that enough progress has been made for Trump to insert himself into the process.", "description": "An end to the trade war in sight?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/trump-xi-handshake.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
