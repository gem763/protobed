What\u2019s more, shoppers can redeem their \u00a320 voucher across a whole range of homewares in-store, making the offer a gift that truly keeps on giving this Christmas\u201d.", "description": "You can get a real Christmas tree for just \u00a39 thanks to Ikea's handy deal", "authors": ["Molly Holt", "Image", "Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20680094.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/111_two-little-kid-boys-buying-christmas-tree-in-outdoor-shop.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
