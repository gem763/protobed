He is accused of basic failures, such as not being abreast of the evidence when he allowed Nick's 'highly implausible' story to be declared 'credible and true'.\n\nThis was an 'inappropriate' and 'prejudicial' strategy, to quote Sir Richard, which he then compounded by ignoring glaring 'inconsistencies' in Nick's farcical testimony, obtaining search warrants 'unlawfully' and, most unforgivably, appearing to give 'no sufficient consideration to the plight of suspects,' while giving 'every possible consideration' to Nick.\n\nThe cruelty inflicted on the suspects because Mr Rodhouse and his team 'were unusually indulgent of Nick' is especially damning.\n\nYet, one of the most startling passages in the near 400-page report is the bullish, self-serving statement made by Mr Rodhouse himself.\n\nHe said: 'Officers were under immense pressure to do the right thing and to keep an open mind. The motivation was to find the truth. We suspect we have not been able to achieve this.\n\n'Charges, prosecutions and convictions cannot be the only barometer of success. We cannot only investigate the obviously guilty. Our decisions were brave and taken in good faith.'", "description": "Steve Rodhouse, Director General of the National Crime Agency, has faced criticism for the Met's handling of claims about the non-existent VIP paedophile in Westminster.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/11/19357932-0-image-a-14_1570356037712.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
