According to a survey of 1,087 graduate business programs at 363 business schools by the Graduate Management Admission Council, 70% of two-year full-time MBA programs in the United States saw a decline in application volume in 2018.\n\nHarvard Business School, Stanford's Graduate School of Business and The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania all saw decreases in applications that year.\n\nBut earning an MBA can still pay off big for graduates. According to the nonprofit National Association of Colleges and Employers, the average starting salary for MBA graduates from the class of 2019 is $84,580, some $25,000 more than the average for graduates with bachelor's degrees in business.\n\nTo determine which business schools pay off the most for students, WalletHub compared nearly 100 schools across 10 key metrics including tuition, the average base salary for graduates and gender diversity. They then scored the schools, with the highest possible score being 100. The result is WalletHub's Best MBA Programs of 2019.\n\nHere are the best business schools of 2019, according to WalletHub:", "description": "WalletHub compared nearly 100 schools across 10 key metrics including tuition, the average base salary for graduates and gender diversity.", "authors": ["Abigail Hess"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106165588-1570218400770gu.jpg?v=1570218454", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
