(AP) - There will be torn loyalties Sunday among members of the Winovich family of Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania.\n\nTried-and-true fans of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Winoviches have apparently adapted to the premise that 24-year-old Chase Winovich, a rookie NFL linebacker, will be playing for the rival New England Patriots when the season starts for both teams Sunday night at Gillette Stadium.\n\nMost of the family is on board with the new loyalty, Winovich said Monday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty extended Winovich clan,\u201d he said, \u201cbut for the most part, we definitely have.\u201d\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 250-pound Michigan product, selected by the Patriots with a third-round pick in the April draft, has also heard similar tales from friends back in the Pittsburgh suburb.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a couple of people from my hometown publicly display this dilemma of having to root for the Steelers, and having a neighbor or friend or high school teammate also playing for the Patriots,\u201d Winovich said. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a conundrum for them.\n\n\u201cBut really, I\u2019m not worried about all that. I know I have a job to do, whatever that may be on Sunday. Whatever role that is is not necessarily my decision, so I\u2019ve just got to make sure I\u2019m ready to go. It\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d\n\nWinovich made a positive impression almost immediately following his conversion from collegiate defensive end to pro outside linebacker during the preseason. He was the team\u2019s leader in sacks with 2\u00bd over three preseason games, and the fact that he was held out of the finale against the New York Giants was a sign his spot on the 53-man roster was assured.\n\nWinovich, who earned third-team AP All-America status as a senior at Michigan, impressed the Patriots with his high motor and consistency. Fans also embraced him for the long blond hair flowing freely from under his helmet.\n\nBut few rookies escape the rituals of training camp, and Winovich\u2019s locks were no exception. Television cameras captured a moment in the preseason finale when none other than Tom Brady sneaked up on the rookie on the sideline and, brandishing a pair of scissors, snipped away.\n\nThe damage to Winovich\u2019s hairdo wasn\u2019t severe, and he took it in good spirits.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people would pay a lot of money to have Tom as a barber,\u201d Winovich said. \u201cAnd luckily, I kind of had that option for free. People saw him take a snippet out back . literally, a snippet. On the sideline, too. Yeah, that was cool. I got to watch the Patriots on the sideline while getting my hair cut by Tom Brady. It\u2019s an experience, for sure.\u201d\n\nWinovich said he didn\u2019t develop a deep hatred for the Patriots growing up, even though his new team has a 9-4 record against the Steelers, including two playoff wins, since the two teams opened Gillette Stadium in 2002, a 30-14 New England win.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like the Patriots were an in-division rival for the Steelers growing up,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had a lot of competitive games, and are both historic programs, and I\u2019m just thankful to be here. I\u2019m just having fun, taking it one step at a time, and the same goal is always to be the best player I can be. And as dependable as I can be.\u201d\n\nNOTES: the Patriots placed their first-round draft choice, wide receiver N\u2019Keal Harry, on injured reserve with an ankle injury, and re-signed veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas, who was released on Saturday after battling back from an Achilles tendon injury. Thomas practiced with the team early Monday, but was not made available to reporters later.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There will be torn loyalties Sunday among members of the Winovich family of Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Farinella"], "top_image": ""}
