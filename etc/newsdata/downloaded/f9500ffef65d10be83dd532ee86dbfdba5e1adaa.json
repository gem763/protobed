Miners affected by the bankruptcy in Kentucky have been camping out on a train track for six weeks in protest.\n\nBlackjewel is the third coal company in Wyoming to declare bankruptcy this year, but this one is more dramatic: paychecks went unpaid, a CEO was pushed out and, most importantly, the gates of the mines in Gillette, Wyo., which calls itself the energy capital of the U.S., were locked, stopping coal production. Miners say that just doesn't happen.\n\nThe move left about 600 people out of work in Gillette. In two months, only 25% of workers have found jobs, according to local management.\n\nUntil two months ago, Darlene Rea worked in Blackjewel's warehouse. She received freight, wrote invoices and found parts. Since the coal company's abrupt bankruptcy, she's been stuck looking for work.\n\nNational Westmoreland Coal Can End Benefits For Retired Miners, Judge Rules Westmoreland Coal Can End Benefits For Retired Miners, Judge Rules Listen \u00b7 2:36 2:36\n\nNational Kentucky Coal Miners Protest After Not Being Paid By Company That Declared Bankruptcy Kentucky Coal Miners Protest After Not Being Paid By Company That Declared Bankruptcy Listen \u00b7 3:39 3:39\n\n\"Every day, every day, every day, you keep waiting and wondering if somebody is going to call you up. And then there's nothing,\" Rea says, slapping down a sheet of paper listing all the places she's applied for jobs.\n\n\"Peabody Energy, Cloud Peak, Campbell County Hospital, Walmart, Pegasus,\" she says.\n\nNext to many is the word \"rejection.\"\n\nRea has a medically retired husband and a mortgage. Worst comes to worst, they might have to sell the house and move \u2014 a tough option with grandkids nearby. Rea says her positivity is fading with each passing day of a particularly prolonged bankruptcy.\n\n\"I didn't think it was going to be this long. Seriously.\"\n\nTy Cordingly is one of the few who managed to land a new job.\n\n\"I got some co-workers that had to go to Nevada, Montana, South Carolina, you know, Arizona,\" he said. \"When there's not very many jobs \u2014 our entire community is based around the energy industry.\"\n\nGillette isn't just losing people \u2014 it's losing money, too. Blackjewel owes the county $37 million \u2014 funds that support not only local services but state education. It's left local vendors unpaid. The company even owes the federal government more than $60 million. Cordingly thinks Wyoming relies too much on energy.\n\n\"This isn't a story about one individual or one generation. The state has always just counted on us being the cash cow for the state of Wyoming and they didn't have to do any planning because the oil kept flowing and the trains kept rolling out with coal on it,\" he says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cooper McKim/Wyoming Public Media Cooper McKim/Wyoming Public Media\n\nOver the past year, Campbell County produced the most tax revenue for the state: 15% of it. Oil and gas are certainly still flowing, but coal isn't having as much luck.\n\nDriving to his regular diner, retired coal miner Bill Fortner says, \"It's the Stone Age of fossil fuels, coal is. It's done.\"\n\nHis ancestors homesteaded here four generations ago. Fortner is a staunch Republican who has mined coal for much of his life. He says President Trump has been the best shot coal has had, but it hasn't been enough. Production in the Powder River Basin has declined by one-third in the past decade. Fortner says the area needs to adapt, and quickly.\n\n\"Otherwise, we're going to be sitting here looking at another ghost town,\" he said.\n\nLocal leaders say Gillette is already taking steps to diversify its economy. While that's underway, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon says there may be some tight financial years ahead.\n\nThe future is still uncertain for Blackjewel's two mines. The former owner says it plans to buy them back but would only keep them open for the short term.", "description": "Hundreds of coal miners in Wyoming are still out of work two months after their employer declared bankruptcy.
