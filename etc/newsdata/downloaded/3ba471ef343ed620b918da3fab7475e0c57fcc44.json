Podolsky described himself as \u201cvery creative.\u201d Transportation is the \u201csystem of arteries that holds the world together,\u201d he told Wired. \u201cIt\u2019s just very exciting.\u201d\n\nVega Travel catered to customers of eastern European and Russian descent living abroad, according to the statement from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the northern district of Georgia (Delta is headquartered in Atlanta.) Officials say Podolsky took advantage of a large amount of points accrued through Delta\u2019s SkyBonus plan, which allows registered businesses to earn points to trade for free miles or other benefits when their employees travel.\n\nHe allegedly arranged to register a SkyBonus account in the name of a fertility center, which was owned and operated by a relative of the president of Vega. Tickets that Podolsky booked for other customers would rack up SkyBonus miles for the fertility center, even though the travel clients had no connection to the business, according to prosecutors.\n\nPodolsky was arraigned Thursday on 12 counts of wire fraud.\n\nPodolsky\u2019s lawyer said his actions were not fraudulent. \u201cPodolsky \u201cis a well-respected and highly skilled travel adviser who has served a loyal clientele for many years,\u201d attorney Seth Kirschenbaum said in a statement to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \u201cWhile the government says Delta is a victim, the evidence at trial will show Delta actually netted millions of dollars of profits from its relationship with Mr. Podolsky.\u201d\n\nThe airline said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019re happy to see any kind of fraud indicted and continue to work with the FBI and the District Attorney\u2019s office to make sure this case is prosecuted to its fullest extent.\u201d", "description": "Federal prosecutors say the Chicago-based agent bilked the Delta SkyBonus program.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7c161d230000e903531158.jpeg?cache=ld1n95futh&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
