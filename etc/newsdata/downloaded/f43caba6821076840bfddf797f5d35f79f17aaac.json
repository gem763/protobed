It will set the stage for similar litigation in other states, as well as the consolidated nationwide lawsuit that has been compared to the tobacco litigation of the 1990s.\n\nOklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter has asked a state court to publicly release millions of pages of confidential documents that J&J submitted during the discovery phase of the case.\n\n\"The public interest in this information is urgent, enduring and overwhelming,\" he wrote.\n\nThe intrigue: Johnson & Johnson may be better known for selling Band-Aids and baby powder, but the company has an extensive history with prescription painkillers.\n\nJ&J produced raw narcotics in Tasmanian poppy fields, created other active opioid ingredients, and then supplied the products to other opioid makers \u2014 including Purdue Pharma.\n\nThe company boasted at the time that one of its opium poppies \"enabled the growth of oxycodone,\" and said the morphine content of a different poppy was \"the highest in the world,\" according to investor slides obtained by Axios.\n\nJ&J sold the 2 subsidiaries that handled that business, Noramco and Tasmanian Alkaloids, to a private equity firm in 2016 for $650 million.\n\nJ&J also sold off Nucynta, an opioid pill it had marketed, for $1 billion in 2015. It still sells Duragesic, a fentanyl patch that had peak sales of $2 billion in 2004.\n\nThat's not all: Oklahoma is alleging J&J targeted vulnerable populations, including children and older adults, for painkiller prescriptions. The state also says J&J funded groups that aggressively advocated for easy access to opioids.\n\nJ&J has funded several pro-opioid groups, such as the Pain Care Forum. A brochure intended for seniors that was made by a J&J subsidiary also claimed \"opioids are rarely addictive.\"\n\nBecause J&J divested its opioid businesses, Oklahoma's lawyers say, documents related to those activities aren't valuable trade secrets to J&J anymore, and therefore should be made public.\n\nThe other side: J&J urged the Oklahoma court to deny the attorney general's request, saying the state is seeking \"sensationalistic headlines and to poison potential jurors.\"\n\nJ&J's attorneys also wrote that \"even if the motion advanced a legitimate purpose,\" it would violate the court's processes.\n\nIn statements to Axios, J&J said its subsidiaries \"met all laws and regulations\" and that all allegations are \"baseless and unsubstantiated.\"\n\nThe bottom line: Purdue Pharma has become the primary villain in the opioid litigation. But Oklahoma clearly sees J&J as another prime target.", "description": "The opioid crisis is bigger than Purdue Pharma.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/OXDM3tsGsAoNVJRJdpZR9mNegKQ=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/03/11/1552325605826.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-12"}
