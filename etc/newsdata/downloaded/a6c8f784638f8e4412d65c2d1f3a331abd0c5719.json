She picks up new things very quickly, including how to open gates.\n\n\"She is a bit of a show off and loves to strut her stuff in the field, showung off her very flashy trot.\n\n\"She also likes to think she is a race horse when she races our tractor up and down the field.\"\n\nThe two horses are part of a growing number who need rescuing each month.\n\nThe RSPCA rescued more than 1,000 horses from neglect and suffering last year and many of them still need new homes.\n\nAnd the crisis, which has been caused by the high costs of vets bills, the rising costs of hay and feed and falling demand forsome kinds of horses, is showing no sign of slowing down.\n\n(Image: RSPCA)\n\nThe RSPCA has three specialist equine centres - Lockwood in Surrey, Gonsal Farm in Shropshire and Felledge in County Durham, and equine rehoming facilities at Millbrook in Surrey, Southridge in Hertfordshire and Leybourne in Kent.\n\nThis month is the charity's Adoptober and while 328 horses and ponies were found new homes last year, hundreds more still need to be taken on.\n\nDr Mark Kennedy, equine welfare specialist at the RSPCA said: \"Many people know how rewarding rescuing a dog or cat can be, and what a fantastic range of animals come into our care looking for new homes, and we really hope horse people will see that it\u2019s the same for horses - we have some excellent horses and ponies just waiting for a chance in a new home.\n\n\u201cI have rescue horses myself, and know how satisfying it is working with them and bringing out their full potential.\n\n\"In particular, mine have been very responsive to clicker training and it has helped bring out their playful and intelligent nature.\n\n\"Seeing horses who have had a bad start in life developing into fantastic companions or successful riding and competition horses is incredibly rewarding, made even better by knowing you are helping other needy horses by freeing up spaces for them in welfare charity care.\"\n\nAnyone in a position to offer a home to one of the RSPCA\u2019s rescue horses can visit the charity\u2019s rehoming pages .", "description": "Hope the horse has been in a rescue centre for almost all her life after being found riddled with worms and starving to death", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Rspca"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20547406.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RSPCA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
