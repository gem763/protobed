Because what is going to be most dangerous for kids is that we have eleven years to totally change our economy and eliminate carbon in the atmosphere or we will face devastation,\u201d he said, referring to a study published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nElijah\u2019s mother, Stacy Wolfe, said she supports her son\u2019s activism, adding, \u201cIt is unfortunate that the school has to resort to a suspension for such a noble cause.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Broward County School District said in a statement to the Herald: \u201cSchools have processes in place regarding approvals for the distribution of materials, including flyers, on campus.\u201d\n\n\u201cStudents are also expected to adhere to guidance provided to them regarding the distribution of these materials. Any disciplinary measures are in accordance with the Code Book of Student Conduct,\u201d they said, declining to comment further due to student privacy.\n\nAnother Broward County public school is having a field trip to the event, and the districts can host field trips even without providing excused absences to local events.\n\n\u201cLocal field trips do not require approval beyond the school principal\u2019s level,\u201d according to a county field-trip policy document.\n\nElijah still plans to go to the protest and believes the protest is a natural part of learning how to protect nature.\n\n\u201cTrying to teach about preserving the environment without the lens of social activism is kind of pointless,\u201d Elijah said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
