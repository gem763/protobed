It\u2019s inhumane what has happened to us. Please. I\u2019m begging you. Please help us. We won\u2019t be able to grieve and move on and try put the pieces of our shattered lives together until we get justice for Harry.\u2019\n\nSky have learned in early 1994 the US and UK governments struck a deal that all those working in RAF Croughton and their families would have diplomatic protection.\n\nThe broadcaster also report that Mrs Sacoolas has not returned to her home in the US.\n\nSky also say that very soon after the crash Mrs Sacoolas made it known that she had diplomatic immunity but police had the impression she was willing to cooperate so they applied to get the immunity waived. However, they found that she had left.\n\nIt was then that they found out that 'someone at the us embassy' advised her and her family to return to the US.\n\nMr Dunn is pictured with his mother Charlotte Charles. Ms Charles said: 'We would ask Boris Johnson himself, if he hasn\u2019t already, to call President Trump and urge him to right this wrong'\n\n23,000 in UK are given immunity Foreign diplomats and their families are immune from prosecution in their host country under the 1961 Vienna Convention. It means that 23,000 people in the UK who hold this status cannot automatically be hauled before the courts if they commit a crime. However, when an envoy or a relative is accused of a serious offence the Foreign Office will ask their home country to waive immunity. Usually, immunity only covers diplomats and families based in London. However, a special deal is in place which gives it to diplomats and relatives based at RAF Croughton. American officials are said to have turned down the waiver request in Harry Dunn\u2019s case because the suspect\u2019s husband is a spy and they want to protect his identity. It is understood US authorities told the accused woman to get on a plane. In the past, the Foreign Office has expelled diplomats suspected of serious crimes. Last year it emerged that an attache accused of two rapes was thrown out of Britain because his country would not waive his immunity. Other allegations included sexual assault against a diplomat from Algeria, blackmail (Egypt) and possession of a firearm (Cambodia).\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab has called on the US ambassador to \u2018reconsider\u2019 the decision but it is understood so far his appeals have been refused.\n\nThe Government says it is doing \u2018everything it can\u2019 but Mrs Charles, 44, said she feared her son\u2019s death would be \u2018swept under the carpet\u2019. The mother, who works in a GP\u2019s surgery, said her family, including Harry\u2019s twin brother Niall, were devastated and heartbroken but had been \u2018totally deprived of the ability to grieve\u2019.\n\nAsked what message she would give the American woman, she said: \u2018Please just come back. We want to talk to you and understand how you are feeling about what happened. Please come back and face the consequences of your actions. It will be better for us both.\u2019 In a direct appeal to President Trump, she added: \u2018Sit back and look back at the case.\n\n\u2018Consider not just the politics side of it, but the fact there is a completely broken family.\u2019\n\nShe said for weeks after the crash on August 27 no one from the Ministry of Defence or RAF Croughton had been in contact. \u2018We\u2019ve just been left.\u2019\n\nHarry, a petrol station worker, was an avid motorcyclist with more than 50,000 miles under his belt. His family said he was a \u2018highly experienced, safe and capable rider\u2019 who was \u2018riding perfectly safely...travelling on his own side of the road\u2019 when he was in collision with the woman\u2019s Volvo.\n\nHis family said they have been told the woman had been travelling for 400 yards on the wrong side of the road. RAF Croughton is currently being leased by the US government, which is using it as a spying station called the Joint Intelligence Analysis Centre.\n\nEmergency services were called but Harry had suffered multiple injuries and was pronounced dead in hospital. It is understood the American woman, a mother-of-three, had her eldest child in the car with her at the time.\n\nThe car hit Harry head-on and he died soon after in hospital after suffering multiple injuries\n\nHarry's mother, Charlotte Charles, (left with his father Tim) added: We won\u2019t be able to grieve and move on and try put the pieces of our shattered lives together until we get justice for Harry'\n\nMrs Charles, 44, of Banbury, Oxfordshire, told how Harry\u2019s father Tim Dunn received a call from a firefighter at the scene who was a family friend and recognised Harry. She added: \u2018We didn\u2019t get to see him before they lost him. His injuries were horrific. They had done all they could.\u2019 The American woman, who lived in Northamptonshire with her husband and children, was spoken to the next day by police when she told officers she had no plans to leave the UK in the \u2018near future\u2019.\n\nThe Northamptonshire force said during the meeting \u2018diplomatic immunity had been raised as an issue\u2019. Officers then sought to obtain a waiver from the US embassy \u2013 which is required to allow for the arrest and formal interview of a suspect with diplomatic immunity.\n\nHis family said Mr Dunn was a \u2018highly experienced, safe and capable rider\u2019 who was \u2018riding perfectly safely...travelling on his own side of the road\u2019 when he was in collision with the woman\u2019s Volvo\n\nBut the force said it was later informed that the waiver had been refused and the woman had left the country despite the fact that officers had been preparing to send a file to the Crown Prosecution Service over charges of causing death by dangerous driving.\n\nThe family were informed the day after Harry\u2019s funeral. Government sources said the driver and her family were \u2018put on a plane\u2019 within hours of learning she may face charges. Harry\u2019s family believe she was spirited out of the UK quickly as her husband is a spy and because US authorities wanted to ensure his identity was not compromised.\n\nThe US state department refused to answer questions on the case but said \u2018immunity is rarely waived\u2019. UK sources confirmed the woman had \u2018full diplomatic immunity\u2019.\n\nThe car hit Harry (pictured when he was younger) head-on and he died soon after in hospital after suffering multiple injuries\n\nTributes have been left for Harry following the crash near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on August 27\n\nMrs Charles said, if necessary, the family would travel to the US to seek answers. They are also considering a civil claim for compensation against the state department or from the insurers of the woman\u2019s vehicle.\n\nMr Dunn, who is separated from Harry\u2019s mother, said: \u2018I echo everything Charlotte says. The pain of our family\u2019s loss is unbearable.\u2019\n\nDefence expert Stephen Lanyard, a retired US colonel, said: \u2018Once a claim of diplomatic immunity is made and a person has left the country there is very little that can be done to bring them back.\u2019", "description": "Anne Sacoolas left the UK\u00a0despite facing possible charges of causing death by dangerous driving.
