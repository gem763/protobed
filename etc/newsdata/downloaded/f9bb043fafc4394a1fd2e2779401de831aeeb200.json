REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nThe performance of these cyclical sectors over the next few months, as a result, could signal whether U.S. stocks are catching a second wind or eking out their last gains ahead of an economic downturn.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re anchored to improving expectations on the economy and the macro backdrop,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York. \u201cIf we\u2019re wrong on the economy, and this is not a turning point but a tipping point, everything else goes down.\u201d\n\nIn August, economic angst ratcheted up as trade tensions between the United States and China re-escalated. Those worries snowballed early this month as the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s closely watched index of U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in three years during the previous month.\n\nSince then, though, economic data have looked rosier.\n\nU.S. industrial production in August rose 0.6%, its biggest monthly gain in a year, and IHS Markit\u2019s flash PMI reading showed an uptick in U.S. manufacturing for September. Home sales have also improved of late, signaling a potential rebound for the sluggish housing market. Retail sales remain robust, further supporting the notion of a steady U.S. economy.\n\nAccordingly, cyclical stocks have perked up. Financial .SPSY, energy .SPNY and materials .SPLRCM shares have significantly lagged the broader S&P 500 this year. But in September, S&P 500 energy and financial shares have each gained 4.3% and materials shares have advanced 2.5%. All have bested the S&P 500's .SPX 1.7% month-to-date gain.\n\nIndustrial shares .SPLRCI, which have outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, have also been strong, rising 3.1% in September.\n\nGraphic: Cyclicals rally in September, here\n\nThe possibility of impeachment proceedings against U.S. President Donald Trump have boosted defensive utilities .SPLRCU, real estate .SPLRCR and consumer staples .SPLRCS shares in the past few days. Even so, a sustained boost in growth indicators could lend further support to shares that tend to track how the economy is doing.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S., it feels like there is some stabilization in the economic data,\u201d said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors in London. \u201cThis could be the time to start increasing exposure to cyclicals.\u201d\n\nOthers have also become more favorable on cyclical stocks. Jefferies now recommends energy shares, while RBC Capital Markets upgraded its rating on industrial shares to \u201coverweight.\u201d\n\nRelatively low valuations also make certain cyclical shares appealing, said Steven DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies. The 12-month forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratios for financials and industrials, at 12.3 and 16.1 respectively, are well below their late 2017 and early 2018 peaks and lower than the 17.1 forward PE for the S&P 500. Meanwhile, the forward PE ratio for utilities, at 19.8, has zoomed past its 2018 levels as investors have turned to defensive shares during bouts of market volatility.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge gap between cyclical and defensive stuff,\u201d DeSanctis said. \u201cOne would think it\u2019s time for a little bit of a shift.\u201d\n\nGraphic: Playing defense is pricy, but cyclicals are cheap, here\n\nNot all market watchers are convinced that economic data support a sustained run in cyclicals, however. In a recent note, UBS chief market strategist Francois Trahan argued that the recent rebound in economic indicators would be short-lived, given the decline in corporate earnings growth and the lingering effects of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes in 2018.\n\nMona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors, is likewise skeptical. She suggests investors tilt their portfolios toward defensive shares as well as growth-oriented stocks in the technology .SPLRCT and communication services .SPLRCL sectors.\n\n\u201cFor the cyclical story to really work, you would need to see stabilization in the PMI data and a resolution around trade,\u201d Mahajan said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing softening rhetoric, but we haven\u2019t seen tariffs being pulled back.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nIndeed, the progression of U.S.-China trade relations may determine which camp is correct. For instance, Shah of Principal anticipates that U.S. economic growth will reach its low at the end of the year and then rebound. But \u201cthat\u2019s with the assumption that geopolitical events don\u2019t get out of hand,\u201d she said.\n\nEven if economic data weakened further, some cyclical stocks could still outperform, said Calvasina of RBC Capital Markets. Because the shares have languished in comparison to the S&P 500 at large over the past few years, they are likely to incur relatively small losses on the way down.\n\n\u201cIf everything is about to fall apart, it could still be good for a deep value, cyclical trade,\u201d Calvasina said. \u201cLate in the economic expansion, you have to be on alert for a style shift.\u201d", "description": "Improved economic sentiment in recent weeks has lifted shares of U.S. financial, energy, industrial and materials companies, but analysts are sharply divided on whether that optimism is warranted.", "authors": ["April Joyner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434606232&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q1DH", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
