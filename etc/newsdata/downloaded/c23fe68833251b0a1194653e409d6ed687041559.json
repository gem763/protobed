So why can't babies have honey? The answer is in bacteria\u2014and how an immature digestive system handles it.\n\nIf it\u2019s so high in antioxidants and packed with health benefits, then why can\u2019t babies have honey? This natural sweetener is normally a great choice\u2014but not for little ones. In fact, for infants under the age of one, it is an absolute no-no. Here\u2019s why.\n\nMOM'S FUNNY BEDTIME TRICK FOR CALMING DOWN HER KIDS GOES VIRAL: 'I'M NOT EVEN SORRY'\n\nThe Problem with Honey\n\nThe main reason honey can be dangerous for babies is because of a certain type of bacteria, clostridium, that has potential to lurk inside. Known for thriving in dust and soil, clostridium has the power to contaminate honey. In cases where it does, the honey is dangerous for a baby\u2019s digestive system because it isn\u2019t strong enough to fend off the bacteria. This can cause infant botulism, with serious results. Typical symptoms from this type of food poisoning include poor sucking, lethargy, a weak cry, constipation and decreased muscle tone, for example.\n\nFood poisoning experts avoid these foods, too.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHow a Baby\u2019s Developing Digestive System Reacts\n\nThe main reason infants can\u2019t handle the clostridium bacteria and adults can is because of digestive system maturity. During the first year of life, a baby\u2019s digestive system is still developing. While an adult\u2019s body is able to move bacteria through the body before it can cause harm, an infant\u2019s isn\u2019t yet strong enough.
