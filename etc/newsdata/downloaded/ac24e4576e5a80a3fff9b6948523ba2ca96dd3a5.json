If more than 10 candidates qualify for the debate, there will be a second night on October 16.\n\nCampaigns will have until 11:59 p.m. ET on October 1 to meet donor and polling thresholds to qualify. The thresholds to qualify are the same as the thresholds for the September 12 debate, meaning that a candidate who did not qualify for the September debate could reach the polling and donor thresholds to qualify for the October debate.\n\nCandidates must receive 2% or more support in at least four polls, which may be national polls or polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Candidates also must receive donations from at least 130,000 unique donors, with 400 donors per state in at least 20 states. Several candidates who did not qualify for the September debate have complained that the qualifications were too stringent.\n\nTen candidates have qualified for the September 12 debate. The debate will be hosted by ABC News in partnership with Univision, and moderated by ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos, ABC News \"World News Tonight\" Anchor and Managing Editor David Muir, ABC News Correspondent Linsey Davis and Univision Anchor Jorge Ramos.\n\nHere are the candidates who qualified for the third debate, in the order they will appear on the debate stage:\n\nMinnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar\n\nNew Jersey Senator Cory Booker\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\n\nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren\n\nCalifornia Senator Kamala Harris\n\nAndrew Yang\n\nFormer Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro\n\nAt least two candidates were on the brink of qualifying for the third debate and have a good chance of meeting the thresholds for the fourth. Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard and billionaire Tom Steyer have met the donor threshold but not the polling threshold.", "description": "The fourth Democratic presidential debate will be held October 15 in Ohio", "authors": ["Grace Segers", "Grace Segers Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital.", "Sarah Ewall-Wice"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/01/72f8ca84-7663-41b3-a478-837163f77cf1/thumbnail/1200x630/f8abfac92752669d3db80b95649b7846/gettyimages-1165420683.jpg"}
