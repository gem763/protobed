He went after Mr. Schiff anew, and blasted Speaker Nancy Pelosi, charging that she \u201chands out subpoenas like they\u2019re cookies.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Michael Crowley\n\nRead on: Impeachment War Room? Trump Does It All Himself, and That Worries Republicans\n\nAnd more: Fact-Checking 4 of Trump\u2019s Claims About the Impeachment Inquiry\n\nAdam Schiff learned the outlines of the whistle-blower\u2019s concerns days before he filed his complaint.\n\nThe C.I.A. officer who filed the whistle-blower complaint first had a colleague convey concerns about President Trump to the C.I.A.\u2019s top lawyer. But concerned about how that avenue for airing his allegations was unfolding, the officer then approached a House Intelligence Committee aide about his allegations.\n\nThe early account by the future whistle-blower shows how determined he was to make known his allegations against Mr. Trump. It also explains how Mr. Schiff knew to press for the complaint when the Trump administration initially blocked lawmakers from seeing it.\n\nThe House staff member, following the committee\u2019s procedures, suggested the officer find a lawyer to advise him and file a whistle-blower complaint. The aide shared some of what the officer conveyed to Mr. Schiff. The aide did not share the whistle-blower\u2019s identity with Mr. Schiff or anyone else, an official said.\n\nMr. Trump wasted no time in trying to use the revelation about the whistle-blower\u2019s attempt to alert Congress to try to denigrate his complaint. In a news conference in the East Room of the White House after this article was published, Mr. Trump called it a scandal that Mr. Schiff knew the outlines of the whistle-blower\u2019s accusations before he filed his complaint.\n\n\u201cBig stuff. That\u2019s a big story,\u201d Mr. Trump said, waving a copy of the article in the air. \u201cHe knew long before and helped write it, too. It\u2019s a scam,\u201d the president added, accusing Mr. Schiff of helping the whistle-blower write his complaint. There is no evidence that Mr. Schiff did, and his spokesman said he saw no part of the complaint before it was filed.\n\n\u2014 Julian E.
