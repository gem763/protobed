Courtesy of the retailer. Photo: Courtesy the retailer\n\nMy criteria were reasonable, I thought: just a lampshade that not everybody else has (I\u2019m looking at you, Ikea Sinnerlig), and doesn\u2019t dominate a room, but has more personality than the giant paper balls that dominated the houseshares of yore and doesn\u2019t cost more than my annual electricity bill. And yet, months after moving house, half my bulbs still hung bare. And not in a \u2018pop-up kombucha bar\u2019 way. I scrolled Made.com, Habitat, and West Elm, then eBay, Gumtree, and Facebook Marketplace. I flirted with the idea of conceptual chandeliers and trawled charity shops hoping to unearth a perfectly preserved wicker-basket shade from 1973. Eventually, eight pages deep into a Google shopping search and on the verge of giving up and buying a generic cream drum, I stumbled across this: the wire-cage hessian light shade from Wilko.\n\nYes, Wilko. Temple of toilet brushes; emporium of AA batteries, paint rollers, and scouring pads. I\u2019ve felt a vague affection towards Wilko since I used to buy my pre-cinema sweets there as a kid, but I had no idea it also sold the lampshade of my dreams for \u00a314 (now reduced to \u00a312). I love it so much I\u2019ve bought three. While the store has a handful of other gems \u2014 copper saucepans for a tenner, Scandi-looking dinner sets, pleasingly speckled jugs \u2014 there\u2019s nothing else like my shade in the shop.\n\nWith its hessian-inlaid cage design, the shade sits at a pleasing intersection of industrial and retro. It\u2019s a dead ringer for a 1960s glass-based table lamp that my friend Caroline, who is blessed in such matters, once bought in a junk shop. It works nicely above all my eBay-sourced teak, but feels cooler and more contemporary than going down a fringed velvet or extravagantly patterned route. I\u2019m confident I won\u2019t be bored or embarrassed by this lampshade in three years\u2019 time, and it isn\u2019t often I can say that about \u2026 well, anything.\n\nPractical bonus points: It hangs on your existing pendant, rather than needing to be fitted by an electrician or plucky DIY-er \u2014 and comes complete with a reducing ring, which adapts the shade to fit different widths of light pendant. The inch-wide gap between the metal frame and hessian means it\u2019s easy enough to dust, if a dusty shade gets you down. And best of all, you get to yell \u201cWilko! I KNOW!\u201d at every guest who ever looks at the ceiling. It\u2019s truly the little lampshade that could.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
