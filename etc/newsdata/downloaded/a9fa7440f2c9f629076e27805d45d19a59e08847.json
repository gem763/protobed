Gavin Newsom blamed on years of mismanagement by the utility.\n\nBy late Thursday, PG&E announced it had restored power to more than half of those affected, and about 312,000 remained without electricity.\n\nThe Sandalwood fire erupted when a \"trash truck dumped a load of burning trash that spread onto vegetation,\" shortly before 2 p.m. Thursday, in the community of Calimesa, Calif., about 110 kilometres east of Los Angeles, the fire department said.\n\nThe fire covered just over 200 hectares and is 10 per cent contained, the department's spokesperson, Rob Roseen, said early on Friday.\n\n'If you live in that area, please just pack up and leave now,' a fire official told the Los Angeles Times. (Gene Blevins /Reuters)\n\nThe California Highway Patrol shut down portions of U.S. 210, and news media reported a number of motorists were stuck on the interstate highway because of the fire.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the hot gusty winds that usually hit northern California in October, sometimes called the Diablo Winds, would continue into Friday morning.\n\nMuch of Northern California, from San Francisco to the Oregon border, remains under a state \"red flag\" fire alert.\n\nNewsom faulted PG&E for putting what he called \"greed\" ahead of investments in its infrastructure to harden the electrical grid against dangerous winds.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment.\n\nAs winds moved south, a similar cutoff was under way by Southern California Edison, which warned more than 173,000 customers they could lose power.", "description": "Burning trash dumped by a garbage truck caused a fire in Southern California that by early Friday had destroyed dozens of homes in\u00a0Riverside County, fire officials said, as wildfires across the state led to power cuts for hundreds of thousands of customers.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5317584.1570792900!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/california-wildfire.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
