Must girl superheroes fight like the boys?", "language": "en", "text": "Meet the new girl cartoon superhero: someone who takes no nonsense from anyone and revels in a good fight as much as the boys.\n\nThat is how Lauren Faust, the executive producer of the new hit television series, \u201cDC Super Hero Girls\u201d, sees her.\n\nBut Hollywood stars Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning seemed to take a different tack this weekend, days before the premiere of their new movie, \u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil\u201d.\n\nThey insist that girls being strong is about more than being physically tough.\n\nJolie said that strong women are often portrayed as having to \u201cbeat the man, or she has to be like the man, or she has to somehow not need the man.\u201d\n\nBut Faust told the world\u2019s biggest gathering of makers of children\u2019s entertainment in the south of France that is not just boys who want to watch their superheroes face off against each other.\n\n\u201cToo many shows for girls are less about entertaining them or reflecting them and come across as lectures on how we expect girls to behave,\u201d she argued at MIPJunior in Cannes, which ends Sunday.\n\nFaust admitted that \u201csome of the fights get extreme\u201d in her Cartoon Network show, a rebooted version of a DC superhero series now on Netflix.\n\n\u201cGirls have been short-changed in the cool stakes\u201d for years by traditional television, said Faust, an Emmy winner who previously worked on \u201cMy Little Pony\u201d and \u201cSuper Best Friends Forever\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Girls as \u2018perfect angels\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cGirls are portrayed as perfect angels all the time,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat is why (their shows) end up being very soft and very nice and everyone is very concerned about everybody else\u2019s feelings all the time,\u201d the producer added.\n\nBut that is not what young teenage girls want from their superheroes, Faust insisted.\n\n\u201cIt is important to a degree but not really exciting to watch, and is that something that is going to follow you growing up in your life?\u201d\n\nInstead Faust said Wonder Woman, Supergirl, Batgirl and the vegan environmental superhero Green Lantern must overcome their own flaws and weaknesses as well as their daily teenage struggles before they take on evil.\n\n\u201cOur superheroes also have teenage supervillains, and we do not hold back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have episodes when they (the baddies) are trying to kill people.\n\n\u201cIn the pilot, when Wonder Woman and Supergirl meet for the first time they get in a fight and Wonder Woman literally pounds Supergirl\u2019s face into the floor.\u201d\n\nIn another, Supergirl is \u201cknocked across the floor and has a huge shiner for the rest of the episode and she looks very pained. She really got hit.\u201d\n\nBut Fanning, who plays Princess Aurora again in the second \u201cMaleficent\u201d movie, said her character\u2019s \u201cstrength is her kindness\u201d.\n\nShe said creators are now under pressure to make princesses strong. They want to \u201cmake her tough, so we\u2019re gonna make her fight!\n\n\u201cIs that what being a strong woman means?\u201d she asked in comments reported by the BBC.\n\n\u201cLike we just have to have a sword and have armour on and go fight? Aurora can do that in a different way, in a pink dress, and it\u2019s beautiful that she keeps her softness and vulnerabilities,\u201d she added.\n\nFaust said her female-dominated creative team was turning the stereotype of cartoon action on its head to draw in just as many boys as girls.\n\nThe female superheroes team up and often tussle over who is boss with a boy group called the \u201cInvinci-Bros\u201d, although Faust is adamant that they will \u201cstay away from romance. I think on girls\u2019 shows this becomes too much of a focus.\u201d\n\nIn the past, she said, female cartoon characters tended to be reduced to \u201cliking shopping, makeup and talking a lot on the phone\u201d.\n\nShe said that she hoped that \u201cDC Super Hero Girls\u201d might help rectify the superhero gender imbalance.\n\n\u201cIf I was 16 it would really make me mad\u201d to see Superman being so famous while Supergirl was \u201cchopped liver\u201d with hardly anybody knowing who she was, Faust added.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Meet the new girl cartoon superhero: someone who takes no nonsense from anyone and revels in a good fight as much as the boys.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/carton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
