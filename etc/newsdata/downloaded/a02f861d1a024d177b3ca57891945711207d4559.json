AP\n\nHudson's Bay shares ended up 6.1 per cent at $C10.30, below the deal price, indicating that most investors believed the deal would be voted through by shareholders.\n\nAn independent valuation report by real estate services firms CBRE and Cushman & Wakefield valued Hudson's Bay real estate at $C8.75 per diluted share, helping Mr Baker's push to convince the special committee to a deal closer to his offer.\n\nHudson's Bay chief executive officer Helena Foulkes had said last year the real estate could be valued at as much as $US28 ($41) per share.\n\nThe founding family of another North American department store operator, Nordstrom, tried to take it private last year, but a special committee of the board rejected the $US8.4 billion offer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the completion of the take-private deal would be a victory for Mr Baker, it would also represent the latest chapter of the company's retreat from its ambitions to become a global retail powerhouse.\n\nMr Baker, 53, a real estate developer who turned to the retail business early in his career, acquired Hudson's Bay more than a decade ago through a private equity firm built by his father, Robert Baker.\n\nWhen Mr Baker invested in Hudson\u2019s Bay, he believed that one of its holdings, Canadian discount chain Zellers, was highly valuable, according to people familiar with his thinking at the time.\n\nAfter inciting a bidding war between Walmart and Target for Hudson's Bay's Canadian discount chain Zellers, he inked a deal with Target for the stores.\n\n\"He\u2019s a tireless dealmaker ... and a wonderful negotiator,\" said Marc Cooper, CEO of investment bank PJ Solomon, who worked for Hudson's Bay selling Lord & Taylor to start-up retailer Le Tote for $US100 million in August.\n\nMr Baker took Hudson's Bay public in 2012 with a $US365 million offering, and then completed a string of acquisitions, including Saks Fifth Avenue, now Hudson's Bay's most profitable business, for $US2.9 billion.\n\nThe executive has reportedly visited stores owned by Hudson's Bay around the world by private jet and often commutes to his office in downtown Manhattan by boat via the Hudson River from his home in Connecticut.\n\nHudson's Bay is now focusing on its core businesses, Saks, and the eponymous Hudson's Bay department store chain in Canada.\n\n\"What (Baker) didn't realise is how difficult it would be to run retail operations,\" Mr Cooper said.\n\nReuters", "description": "The completion of the take-private deal represents the latest chapter of the company's retreat from its ambitions to become a global retail powerhouse.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3248%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_59%2C$y_142/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f5d211d1c1b22804dafe0cfd5e1e0d21bdf78c41", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
