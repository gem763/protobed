Dlodlo wants the court to prevent the release of the report because it is classified.\n\nThe report was attached to court papers in a separate, but related, application in the Equality Court between the EFF and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan.\n\nREAD | Mkhwebane was determined to make findings against me 'irrespective of evidence to the contrary' - Gordhan\n\nThe EFF released the report publicly last week, despite the fact that it has not been declassified, and Mkhwebane referenced it in her report into Gordhan.\n\nShe found that President Cyril Ramaphosa should discipline Gordhan because he authorised the \"rogue unit\" \u2013 an investigative unit within SARS which Mkhwebane found was \"illegal\".\n\nGordhan went to court to have the implementation of Mkhwebane's remedial action suspended, pending a full review of the report. In granting Gordhan's application, Potterill found that Mkhwebane's orders against Gordhan were \"vague, contradictory and/or nonsensical\".\n\nMkhwebane took that interdict on review and later withdrew her application. But the EFF has also applied for review and the Constitutional Court is expected to hear the matter.\n\nMkhwebane reportedly laid a complaint against Potterill with the Judicial Services Commission (JSC). On Friday, lawyers for the parties met in Ledwaba's chambers to discuss scheduling issues around the IGI report matter, which will now be heard on November 6.\n\nCity Press on Sunday quoted Mkhwebane's spokesperson, Oupa Segalwe, as having said that Potterill was removed from the Dlodlo matter by Ledwaba on Friday because of the JSC complaint against her.\n\n\"She has already made disparaging findings against the Public Protector and expressed her negative views on the matter,\" Segalwe reportedly said.\n\nBut lawyers for Pillay, who joined Gordhan's review application in support of the minister's case, say Segalwe's remarks contradict what really happened in the meeting on Friday.\n\nBernard Hotz, the attorney representing Pillay, said he could not comment on what took place at the \"confidential\" meeting. Pillay was also implicated in the Gordhan report and has supported Gordhan's application to have it reviewed in court.\n\nBut Hotz said he would be writing to the deputy judge president to say that, if what was attributed to Segalwe by City Press was accurate, he would like to \"draw his (Ledwaba's) attention to it\", as it \"contradicts what was said\".\n\nHe said it would not be appropriate to comment further.", "description": "Lawyers for SARS deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay intend writing to the North Gauteng deputy judge president about a report that a judge was taken off a case because she allegedly made disparaging remarks about the Public Protector in a judgment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9220/41276e52854e473c99543ddde4f5f633.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
