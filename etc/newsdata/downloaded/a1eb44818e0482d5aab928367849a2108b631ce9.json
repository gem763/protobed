Donald Trump tears into Fox News", "language": "en", "text": "Donald Trump vented at the Fox News Channel on Thursday after the network's pollsters published a shocking survey that showed more than half of registered voters want him removed from office.\n\nThe morning 'Fox & Friends,' along with evening opinion hosts Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, have been reliable cheerleaders for the Trump administration. But the president has become increasingly frustrated by daytime news anchors and paid pundits who take pointed shots at him, two White House officials said Thursday.\n\n'From the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll. Whoever their Pollster is, they suck,' Trump tweeted on Thursday. 'But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days.'\n\n'With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore.'\n\n'It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President!' he sniffed.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is increasingly frustrated by Fox News Channel daytime anchors and paid pundits who take pointed shots at him, two White House officials said Thursday\n\nTrump vented on Twitter, saying Fox News pollsters 'suck,' after they found 51 per cent of registered U.S. voters want Congress to impeach him and remove him from office\n\nNapolitano has denied in the past that he has ever asked Trump for a judicial appointment. In recent months he has morphed into a reliable critic, enraging the president by offering legal analyses that conclude he has committee impeachable offenses.\n\nFox News polls have been uniformly unfavorable to the president since a month after his inauguration, with 30 polls in a row finding more Americans disapprove of his job performance than approve. The same can be said of most national opinion surveys.\n\nThe network released 23 presidential polls in 2015 and 2016 simulating head-to-head contests between Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. She prevailed in 18 of them.\n\nTrump came out on top in the last 13 of 22 Fox News polls published during the Republican primary season.\n\nWednesday's poll results indicated that 51 per cent of registered voters believe Trump should be impeached and removed from office, a nine-point jump from the previous survey on July 19.\n\nAnother 4 per cent said the president should be impeached but not removed. Forty per cent opposed impeachment completely.\n\nThe president lashed out at Fox News in August after news anchor Sandra Smith interviewed Democratic National Committee Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa. He tweeted that the press flack was 'spewing out whatever she wanted with zero pushback' from Smith.\n\n'The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn\u2019t working for us anymore!' Trump vented.\n\n'Fox hires \u201cgive Hillary the questions\u201d @donnabrazile, Juan Williams and low ratings Shep Smith. HOPELESS & CLUELESS! They should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win,' he tweeted at the time.\n\nFox on-air personalities fired back.\n\n'Fox News isn\u2019t supposed to work for you,' the network's senior political analyst Brit Hume tweeted.\n\n'We don't work for you,' added contributor and Fox radio host Guy Benson.\n\nHinojosa blasted the president hours later on MSNBC, saying that 'the fact that he is attacking a Democratic staffer and believes he has control of Fox News is really something else. It tells you a lot about the relationship between Donald Trump and Fox News.'\n\n'This man is running scared. It is laughable,' she said.", "description": "'From the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll.
