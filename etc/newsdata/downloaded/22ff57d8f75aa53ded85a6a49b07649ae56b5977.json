Jean Caroll in the 1990s.\n\nLosing a Supreme Court challenge to get a citizenship question added to the 2020 census.\n\nInserting himself into a fight between four progressive congresswomen and Democratic leadership by telling the congresswomen\u2014 all of whom are non-white US citizens \u2014 to \"go back and fix the broken and crime-infested places\" countries from which they came.\n\nSlamming the city of Baltimore as a \"disgusting, rodent-infested mess\" that \"no human\" would want to live in and attacking its congressman Rep. Elijah Cummings as \"a brutal bully.\"\n\nEscalating the ongoing trade war with China with new tariffs and bitterly feuding with Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, which Trump himself acknowledges wreaked havoc on markets and stoked fears of a recession.\n\nSpending much of a day visiting victims of mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio attacking officials in both places, and being widely criticized for cutting a campaign-ad style video from his visits to the hospital.\n\nCanceling a planned official trip to Denmark after the country's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen shot down his interest in purchasing the territory of Greenland.\n\nDoubled down on a dangerously misinformed tweet in which he claimed Hurricane Dorian would affect the state of Alabama \u2014 and posed with an official map altered with a black Sharpie marker to show the storm affecting the state.\n\nRepublicans and people to close to the White House lamented to the Washington Post that Trump had \"squandered\" his summer altogether between all the economic upheaval of the trade war and months of personal attacks on his enemies \u2014 despite the White House pointing to what they saw as big accomplishments.\n\nRead more: Americans are rapidly losing confidence in the economy, robbing Trump of his biggest asset for 2020\n\nOne Republican donor told the Post that instead of taking advantage of the relatively quiet summer to actually resolve the trade war or work on a concrete policy accomplishment, he \"fanned the flames of the trade war, attacked Baltimore, 'the squad' and the Federal Reserve, and failed to add a cornerstone achievement to his 2020 election credentials.\"\n\nWhile Trump frequently struggles to meet the demands and norms of his office, being on the campaign trail without the bureaucratic constraints of government allows him to create his own narrative and captivate crowds with his grandiose \u2014 and often exaggerated \u2014 promises and accounts of his administration's own success.\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives to speak at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., Thursday, March 28, 2019.

By comparison, the top-raising Democrat Mayor Pete Buttigieg brought in $24.8 million.\n\nThe Trump campaign, which has around $100 million cash on hand, told Politico that they not only plan on focusing on battleground states, but also making inroads with voter registration and turnout efforts in some traditionally Democratic states including Minnesota, Nevada, and Colorado.\n\nSome campaigns are pointing to head-to-head match-up polling showing top Democrats including former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders defeating Trump.\n\nBut as an extensive 2016 analysis from FiveThirtyEight showed, hypothetical general election polling a year out or more from the actual election has historically been a very poor predictor of the actual election outcomes, meaning neither party can take anything for granted at this point.\n\nRead more:Joe Walsh wants to beat Trump and save the Republican party. But he still defends calling Haiti a 's---hole country.'\n\nTrump is facing two primary challenges from former Gov. Bill Weld and former Rep. Joe Walsh who point to the behavior displayed over the summer as reasons why Trump is fundamentally unfit for office and should be unacceptable even for staunch conservatives.\n\nBut neither are likely to make much of a noticeable dent in Trump's primary or general election prospects if he uses his fall of campaigning to successfully consolidate his current 88% Gallup approval rating among Republicans and convince them that, despite the blundering summer of controversy, they're ultimately better off with him.", "description": "Being on the campaign trail without the bureaucratic constraints of government allows Trump to create his own narrative and captivate crowds.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d56947acd978406bf565774-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
