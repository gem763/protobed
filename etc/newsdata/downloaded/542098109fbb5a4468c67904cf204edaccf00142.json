Little did viewers know, however, the satellite will go on to change the course of The Walking Dead as they know it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShowrunner Angela Kang, who has been widely hailed as The Walking Dead\u2019s saviour since taking the reins, explained all.\n\n\u2018It actually, weirdly, started with conversations about ships and ghost ships, and like these ideas of things that are drifting around on the ocean,\u2019 she explained. \u2018We were trying to think of, \u201cWhat are things that happen over time in an apocalypse that we haven\u2019t explored on the show yet?\u201d And so somebody brought up this idea of like, \u201cWell satellites, like if they\u2019re not maintained, they degrade and eventually fall out of orbit.\u201d\n\nThe satellite will play a big part in Eugene\u2019s arc this season of The Walking Dead (Picture: AMC)\n\n\u2018It even happens in our world now, but it\u2019s not as common because they\u2019re being maintained.\u2019\n\n\u2018Thematically, we wanted to kind of talk about a war that felt like it had Cold War aspects and the Whisperers like always watching our people, and so a satellite felt like a good metaphor for that,\u2019 Kang continued.\n\n\u2018But we also just thought that that was a fun and, hopefully, a strange and exciting way to start the season and, you know, the satellite has other implications for the season going forward as well.\u2019\n\nEugene Porter (Josh McDermitt) will have a particularly keen interest in the satellite and its contents\u2026\n\nThe Walking Dead\u2019s introduction to season 10 was suitably horrifying and is only going to get more disturbing as the Whisperers take centre stage with new recruit Gamma (Thora Birch) in episode two.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Walking Dead airs Sundays on AMC in the US and follows a day later at 9pm on Fox UK.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
