GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks fall as China cancels U.S. farm visits, yields dip\n\n* China agriculture delegation scraps U.S. farm visit to\n\nMontana\n\n* MSCI world equity index slips\n\n* Central bank easing helps risk sentiment but trade\n\ntensions hurt\n\n* Treasury yields fall; dollar falls vs yen\n\n* Oil prices edge higher\n\n(Updates to U.S. close of trading)\n\nBy Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\n\nNEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - An index of global stock\n\nmarkets surrendered early gains on Friday after Chinese\n\nagriculture officials who were to visit U.S. farm states next\n\nweek canceled their trip, dampening optimism on U.S.-China trade\n\ntalks.\n\nRenewed worries about the state of the ongoing trade\n\ntensions between Washington and Beijing drove Treasury yields\n\nlower and pushed the U.S. dollar down against the safe-haven\n\nJapanese yen.\n\nStocks had started the day stronger as stimulus measures by\n\nmajor central banks eased worries about growth. But optimism\n\nfaded following the report that the Chinese officials canceled\n\ntheir visit. The cancellation came as U.S.-Chinese trade talks were held\n\nin Washington and U.S. President Donald Trump said he wanted a\n\ncomplete trade deal, not just an agreement for China to buy more\n\nU.S. agricultural goods.\n\nThe MSCI world equity index , which tracks\n\nshares in 47 countries, was 0.23% lower.\n\nOn Wall Street, stocks, which had started the day strong\n\nfollowing China cutting a key lending rate for the second\n\nstraight month, reversed course on the news of the canceled\n\nfarm visits.\n\nEquity markets have largely welcomed the central bank moves\n\nin recent days, including interest rates cuts by the European\n\nCentral Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nFor months, Wall Street has bounced up and down with signs\n\nof improvement or deterioration in trade talks, often based on\n\ncomments or tweets from Trump, a cycle investors have grown\n\naccustomed to.\n\n\"In this case, it's a bit more concerning because it's China\n\nmaking the decision, rather than Trump,\" said Willie Delwiche,\n\nmarkets strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 159.72 points,\n\nor 0.59%, to end at 26,935.07, the S&P 500 lost 14.72\n\npoints, or 0.49%, to close at 2,992.07 and the Nasdaq Composite\n\ndropped 65.21 points, or 0.8%, to finish at 8,117.67.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 0.29%,\n\nafter giving up some of the gains logged earlier in the session.\n\nIncreased concerns that the United States and China are\n\nunlikely to forge a trade deal in the near term drove U.S.\n\nTreasury yields lower. Benchmark 10-year notes gained 15/32 in price to\n\nyield 1.7215%, down from 1.774% on Thursday.\n\nBonds were also supported after the New York Federal Reserve\n\nsaid it plans to pour cash into the U.S. banking system through\n\nearly October to avert another market disruption, after the cost\n\nof loans in the overnight repurchase agreement (repo) market\n\nsoared to 10% on Tuesday. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar fell sharply against\n\nthe yen as investors weighed the latest developments on the\n\nU.S.-China trade front.\n\nThe yen tends to attract demand in times of market stress as\n\nthe currency is backed by Japan's current account surplus, which\n\noffers it more resilience than currencies of deficit-running\n\ncountries.\n\nThe dollar was 0.43% lower against the Japanese currency.\n\nAgainst a basket of major currencies , the greenback was\n\nup 0.2%. Oil prices eased on Friday on renewed concern over the\n\nU.S.-China trade dispute, but futures still posted weekly gains,\n\nwith Brent marking its biggest weekly increase since January\n\nafter an attack on Saudi Arabia's energy industry last weekend.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures fell 12 cents to settle at $64.28\n\na barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1\n\nfutures ended 4 cents lower at $58.09 a barrel.\n\nLingering tensions in the Middle East along with increased\n\nworries about the trade tensions supported gold, which was on\n\npace for its first weekly rise in four. Spot gold was up\n\n1.12% at $1,515.78 an ounce.\n\nGraphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks fall as China cancels U.S. farm visits, yields dip", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB820J9_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
