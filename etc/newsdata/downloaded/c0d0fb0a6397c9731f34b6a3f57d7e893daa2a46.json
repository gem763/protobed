(AP) - Last season, offense helped the Patriots recover from a 1-2 start while their defense steadily improved throughout the year.\n\nSo far in 2019, it\u2019s been the defense that\u2019s carried New England to a 4-0 start amid injuries to the offensive line and a run game that has suffered as a result.\n\nThe Patriots scored just one offensive touchdown but got a blocked punt returned for a score by the special teams and a late interception by linebacker Jamie Collins to help secure a 16-0 win over the Bills.\n\nTom Brady, who finished 18 of 39 for 150 yards and had one interception, said Buffalo\u2019s defense played a factor in their problems Sunday.\n\n\u201cOffensively we struggled. They force a lot of teams to struggle, and if we\u2019re going to score more points, then we have to do a lot better job than we did (Sunday),\u201d Brady said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t, so that\u2019s just the way it goes.\u201d\n\nNew England\u2019s defense gave up its first touchdown of the season but had four total interceptions and held Buffalo to 2 of 13 on third down. It also limited Bills quarterback Josh Allen - responsible to three of the INTs - to 153 yards passing before he was knocked out of the game in the fourth quarter following a helmet-to-helmet hit by Jonathan Jones.\n\nThe hit was heavily scrutinized after the game because it drew only a personal foul for unnecessary roughness and Jones wasn\u2019t also ejected from the game. NFL officiating chief Al Riveron told a pool reporter afterward the Jones wasn\u2019t ejected because the hit did not meet the league standard for disqualification.\n\nThe hit aside, cornerback Stephon Gilmore said part of the reason the defense has been so successful is because of how well the unit is preparing for its different challenges each week.\n\nHe said they were locked in on their plan to contain Allen.\n\n\u201cEverybody just had to do their job,\u201d Gilmore said. \u201cWe had play calls that we planned on calling and we just trusted everybody. Trusted the defensive line to get there, tried to make him make some tough throws and we were able to come out with the win.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe secondary continues to be the standout group on defense. With two interceptions by J.C. Jackson and one by Devin McCourty on Sunday, the secondary has been responsible for seven of the team\u2019s 10 picks. McCourty has four, his most since 2014.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe run game was again largely ineffective. New England rushed 23 times for 74 yards on Sunday, averaging just 3.2 yards per carry.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nJackson was all over the field. He had two of the Patriots\u2019 four picks and also the blocked the punt that led to Matthew Slater returning it 11 yards for the touchdown.\n\nCoach Bill Belichick said the special teams has been locked in throughout the season and that it all came together on that play. He said the blocked punt is a staple of their practices.\n\n\u201cEvery week we practice it. All of the guys on the punt return team practice it because you never know which guy is going to come free,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cYou might think they\u2019re going to block it a certain way, but the guy makes a mistake. . It\u2019s something we absolutely work on every week, it was a great play by J.C., and Matt Slater was really close on another one.\u201d\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nKicker Stephen Gostkowski struggled again, missing his fourth extra point attempt of the season.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all going to look back on this game and say, \u2018There are some things we can improve on,\u2019\u201d Belichick said. \u201cCertainly, I feel that way. We have a hard-working team. I have a lot of confidence in our team. We\u2019ll just keep working hard to do things better.\u201d\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\nThe Patriots have now won 18 straight games against a first or second-year quarterback, the longest streak in NFL history.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Patriots visit winless Washington.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Last season, offense helped the Patriots recover from a 1-2 start while their defense steadily improved throughout the year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kyle Hightower"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/patriots_bills_football_78633_c0-217-2664-1770_s1770x1032.jpg?cc65c3a8757eecc97e7184fb2f6fd190ed68e6d4", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
