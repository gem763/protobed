You have to take some time out for yourself just to recover or gain perspective on life again.\n\n\u201cSerena and Tracey both committed so hard over the last World Cup cycle and they deserve to have a break.\u201d\n\nLife as an elite athlete can be tough, but if aspiring netballers are looking for a role model to prove it\u2019s possible, it\u2019s Dunn.\n\nShe may be 36 years old \u2013 the oldest member of England\u2019s 2019 World Cup squad \u2013 but Dunn, who has 89 Roses caps to her name, is in the best form of her career despite never playing netball full-time.\n\nLike the rest of the England squad, she was devastated not to come away from Liverpool with a gold medal round her neck, but Dunn feels proud knowing she has helped lay the foundations for future success, whether she gets another chance with the Roses in the new Jess Thirlby era or not.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still disappointed, I won\u2019t lie, but we are so proud of getting the bronze medal and the legacy our home World Cup has left in getting 160,000 new women and girls to take up netball,\u201d added Dunn.\n\n\u201cThe important thing now is trying to keep the buzz of the World Cup going. I\u2019m looking forward to another Vitality Netball Super League domestic season because that\u2019s where netball can be pushed now. We have some of the best players in the world playing over here \u2013 it\u2019s got the potential to be huge.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to England, I just have to decide now what my legs have got left in them and whether I need to have a break from the international side and allow some youngsters to have some court time.\n\n\u201cI want people to be fighting for the shooting positions. It will make our team stronger. I haven\u2019t really had much time to process it yet, but we have lots of exciting young players coming through and I\u2019ll see where I fit with that.\n\n\u201cI was proud to compete in a home World Cup because I never thought I would get to. I thought I would be too old, or not performing anymore. It was just great timing and I was so happy to be a part of it.\u201d", "description": "Winning a World Cup bronze medal one day to working in an NHS laboratory the next, Rachel Dunn is the master of the double life.
