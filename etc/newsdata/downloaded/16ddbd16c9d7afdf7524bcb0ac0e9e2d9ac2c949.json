This is her legacy. USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A book of Toni Morrison quotations is coming out in December.\n\n\u201cThe Measure of Our Lives: A Gathering of Wisdom\u201d will draw from her whole body of work, including celebrated novels such as \u201cBeloved\u201d and \u201cSong of Solomon.\u201d\n\nThe foreword is by Zadie Smith, adapted from a tribute she wrote soon after the Nobel laureate died in August at age 88.\n\nA publisher\u2019s note describes the book as a distillation of her major themes, including \u201ctranscendence through imagination; the self and its discontents; the vicissitudes of love; the whirligig of memory; the singular power of women; the original American sin of slavery; the bankruptcy of racial oppression; the complex humanity; and art of black people.\u201d\n\nThe compact, 128-page compilation was put together by Erroll McDonald, executive editor and vice president of the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. He told The Associated Press on Monday that he thought of the book as a response to the \u201ctremendous adulation\u201d that Morrison received after her death. He intends \u201cThe Measure of Our Lives\u201d to serve as an introduction for new readers and an \u201cideal keepsake\u201d for longtime admirers.\n\nThe book\u2019s title comes from one of Morrison\u2019s most famous sayings, about words themselves: \u201cWe die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives.\u201d\n\nRemembering Toni Morrison: She was our greatest writer, and her stories about race our most essential\n\nFrom 'Beloved' to 'The Bluest Eye': Five essential Toni Morrison books you need to read\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/07/toni-morrison-upcoming-book-celebrates-late-author-best-quotes/3897237002/", "description": "\u201cThe Measure of Our Lives: A Gathering of Wisdom\u201d will draw from Toni Morrison's whole body of work.", "authors": ["Hillel Italie", "Associated Press", "Ta-Nehisi Coates", "Vince Flynn", "Kyle Mills", "Rick Riordan", "Demi Moore", "Bill O'Reilly", "Published A.M.
