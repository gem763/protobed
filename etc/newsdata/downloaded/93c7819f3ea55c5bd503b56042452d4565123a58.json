Eric Ross, chief investment strategist at Cascend Securities, said his research suggests rail customers now see it as a \u201cbuyer\u2019s market,\u201d as increased trucking capacity gives them more choices, leading to lower rail prices.\n\nDespite the volume weakness, Knight said the company\u2019s pricing strategy remains \u201cunchanged,\u201d which he said ensures pricing will generate an appropriate return.\n\nBasically, the company didn\u2019t want to lower prices to fuel demand, as that would lower returns by eating away at gross margins. And Knight said margins will be \u201cimproving\u201d in the second half of the year, so despite lower volumes, previous guidance of sub-61% operating ratio remains intact.\n\n\u201cWe remain confident that the dollars we yield from our pricing initiatives will again well exceed our rail inflation costs in 2019,\u201d Knight said.\n\nCowen analyst Jason Seidl asked during the question-and-answer period following Knight\u2019s prepared remarks, about Knight\u2019s comment that he was confident prices would remain above fail cost inflation: \u201cThat means you\u2019re holding your pricing. Obviously, that\u2019s an across-the-board comment, but you\u2019re probably holding your pricing more as a opposed to just slashing and trying to get some of that.\u201d\n\nKenyatta Rocker, executive vice president of marketing and sales at Union Pacific, responded by saying:\n\n\u201cI\u2019d tell you the expectation for the team, for the commercial team, is that we\u2019re going to price consistent with the value proposition that we have here. It would not be prudent for us to have some of the best service we\u2019ve had in a few to several years, and then we make adjustments. So, we\u2019re going to stay the course in terms of how we look at the market.\u201d\n\nThe company confirmed to MarketWatch that its pricing strategy remained \u201cunchanged.\u201d\n\n\u201c[With] overall volumes slowing, it will be difficult to hold rates up,\u201d Cascend\u2019s Ross wrote in a note to clients. \u201cNorth American rails seem unwilling to lower rates to drive volumes up, but someone\u2019s going to crack and lower rates, to start the cascade downward.\u201d\n\nThe stock UNP, +0.47% rose 0.5% to close Wednesday at $160.08 after slumping 1.6% on Tuesday, and while the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, +1.20% rallied 1.2%.\n\nOver the past three months, Union Pacific shares have shed 7.2%, while the Dow transports has edged down 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.91% has gained 3.2%.", "description": "Union Pacific Corp. said Wednesday that it remained confident that, despite weaker-than-anticipated volumes, it can hold prices at levels that \u201cwell exceed\u201d...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ698_UnionP_ZG_20190904151246.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
