As a result PM Johnson is obliged to request a deadline extension past October 31, with rumours suggest end-January is the next stop. He reportedly sent an unsigned request for an extension to Europe.\n\nThe pound fell in Asian trading, snapping a four-day rising streak, though losses were limited to less than 1% as, even though a deal is likely, we are apparently closer to a deal than any time in the past three-plus years. is now down 0.55% at 1.2911 after reaching 1.2991 on Thursday, the highest since May 13. The 200-day moving average is now at 1.2716.\n\nDaily Chart\n\nGBP/USD Daily Chart\n\nEquities drift higher\n\nAside from the GBP action, it was a mundane start to trading this week. In a common theme in recent days, US equity indices travelled in the opposite direction to the previous NY session, this time rising between 0.21% and 0.31% with no specific news drivers. The rest of the Asian equities followed suit, with the index gaining 0.21%, despite weak exports numbers, the rose 0.55% while out-performed with gains of 0.84%.\n\nJapan exports down more than expected\n\nFurther evidence of the global slowdown came from Japan\u2019s trade data for September. Exports fell 5.2% y/y, more than the -4.0% analysts had expected and the tenth straight month of contraction. Meanwhile, imports fell 1.8% y/y, which was better than the -2.8% forecast. As a result, the merchandise trade deficit was wider than expected, but still narrowed to \u00a5123.0 billion from \u00a5143.5 billion in August. That\u2019s the smallest deficit in three months.\n\nThere was only a muted reaction to the data in , with the pair\u2019s direction dictated more by a slight risk-on mood in the markets. The yen fell 0.06% versus the US dollar, bringing a three-day rising streak to an end. The pair is now at 108.49 and is consolidating below the 200-day moving average at 109.08.\n\nDaily Chart\n\nUSD/JPY Daily Chart\n\nA slow start on the calendar\n\nGerman producer prices for September and a monthly Bundesbank report are the only items on the European calendar while the US calendar is devoid of data or events. Canada goes to the polls today with surveys suggesting it could be a close-run thing.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Forex Analysis by MarketPulse (Andrew Robinson) covering: GBP/USD, USD/JPY, Nikkei 225, Hang Seng.
