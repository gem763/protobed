If two years of Russiagate headaches weren\u2019t enough to get the president wise to the idea that siccing foreign nations on his political opponents is a gambit better left alone, you can bet a scolding from Nancy Pelosi won\u2019t get the job done for next time, either. Trump does what he wants, and sometimes the things he wants to do are apparently high crimes and misdemeanors. If they don\u2019t get him out now, who would put money on the possibility that he simply chooses on his own never to do those things again?\n\nOf course, it\u2019s true: Getting him out isn\u2019t going to happen, not with Republicans in the Senate fully in Trump\u2019s thrall. But the idea that there will be no price to pay for Republicans for stonewalling is remarkable. If you\u2019d mapped this scenario out in advance to Republicans in 2016, they\u2019d rightly see it as an absolute worst-case scenario for a Trump presidency: a case where the wrongdoing is clear-cut and intolerable, and every elected Republican is forced to choose between condoning the wrongdoing and bringing down the terrible wrath of the president on his own head.\n\nDoes that sound like a lay-up to you?", "description": "", "authors": ["Andrew Egger", "Thebulwark.Com Voting-On-Impeachment-Is-The-Senate-Gops-Nightmare"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
