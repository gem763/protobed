Heading up Off-White, performing packed out DJ sets internationally, designing Louis Vuitton\u2019s highly coveted menswear collection. It\u2019s no surprise he\u2019s planning on taking a backseat for a bit to recover, but before he bounces, he\u2019s finally finished one more project: a collection of homeware for everybody\u2019s favourite Scandinavian meatball-slash-flatpack furniture makers, IKEA.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve been drip-fed previews of the IKEA collection for the best part of 12 months, but have been kept in the dark as to when it would finally hit the shelves of those labyrinthine stores. Well, wait no more! Virgil\u2019s collection, titled MARKERAD (that\u2019s \u201cmarked\u201d in Swedish), will finally be arriving on November 1st.\n\nOn top of the pieces we\u2019ve been introduced to already -- wall clocks emblazoned with the phrase \u201cTEMPORARY\u201d and astroturf-rugs -- Virgil has added some new bits into the mix. There\u2019s some chic armchairs, Virgil-approved toolkits and, for those of us who are flat pack furniture-phobic, a table that can be assembled without a single screw or hammer.\n\nBut our favourite piece, without doubt, is the barmy lightbox version of Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s classique Mona Lisa, blown up to twice its original size and kitted out with a USB port, so you can charge your phone with a 16th century masterpiece \u2013 all for less than \u00a3100. Virgil has long been obsessed with that painting, using it as the basis for tees and hoodies in past Off-White collections too.\n\n\u201cI look forward to [seeing] how these everyday objects will enter people\u2019s homes and hopefully add an emotional value to them,\u201d he said in a statement released alongside photos of the new collection. \u201c... In the same way you might hang a piece of art work on your wall, art can bleed into objects like a chair, table or rug. That was my initial problem to solve when creating this collection together with IKEA.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t know about you, but we\u2019re planning on binning all of our current wall chargers and are refusing to get our juice from anything other than renaissance paintings in the future. It\u2019s what Da Vinci would have wanted.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "Broke: queueing to see a Da Vinci at the Louvre.
