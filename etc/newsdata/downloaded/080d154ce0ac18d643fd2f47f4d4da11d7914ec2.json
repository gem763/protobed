In fact, come to think of it, for the past few years the entire country seems to have been blundering around, ricocheting off the walls, tripping over the furniture, talking rubbish and making a hash of everything.\n\nLast week, Boris Johnson tried to pretend to a man who collared him in a hospital corridor that his accompanying camera crew didn\u2019t exist, only they obviously did because the whole incident was seen on our screens. Meanwhile, David Cameron got muddled on Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield\u2019s This Morning and ended up saying he \u201cshat\u201d when he first saw the big red \u201cVote Leave\u201d bus. He meant that he \u201cshouted\u201d but they all dissolved into sofa giggles anyway, because what else can you do?\n\nMy own usual feelings of discombobulation were further exacerbated by a series of small personal upsets that left me floundering helplessly. It began with a picture on the internet of a bra/harness contraption that promised to alleviate a wrinkly cleavage. But hold on, cleavage is a wrinkle. In fact, it\u2019s one big wrinkle, and if you alleviate it, then what have you got?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAdvertised on Amazon as \u201can anti-wrinkle chest/breast pillow pad bra\u201d, the device looked like a large incontinence thong had been strung between the cups of a normal bra which, apparently, if worn through the night helps to reduce and prevent the devastating effects of \u201cside sleeping\u201d. Hmm, what are men going to do about their devastating testicle wrinkles then? Are they going to start sleeping with a ball hammock tucked between their legs?\n\nAnyway, not long after I\u2019d witnessed the \u201cbra pillow\u201d spectacle my WiFi crashed out. I think it had seen a terrible thing and couldn\u2019t cope anymore. Obviously, at this point I did what any sane person would do. I hid under the duvet and counted to a million, because that normally helps. Only this time it didn\u2019t and eventually after giving myself an anti-hysteria slap I ended up on the EE helpline talking to a very nice young man called Ethan.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Had Ethan told me to wear a bra pillow, I would have done so.\n\nSadly, the pin trick didn\u2019t work, I could feel the tears pricking, but Ethan held me steady. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a fault at the exchange,\u2019\u2019 he told me soothingly, \u201cThey\u2019re working on it and it will be fixed by the end of the day.\u201d Ethan\u2019s mother should be very proud of him, he acted like a responsible adult, he was clear and calm and didn\u2019t leave his post. Listen, he could have put me on hold and I could still be listening to \u201cOpus Number One\u201d (the world\u2019s most common phone hold music) three weeks later, but no, by 6pm I had my WiFi back, and it felt like being reborn.\n\nTechnology has us all clamped firmly between its monster thighs and it\u2019s a love-hate thing, especially for those of us who haven\u2019t a clue how it works and whose first reaction when faced with a digital form to fill in via an online \u201cportal\u201d is to go to the lavatory for a very long time.\n\nAnd I know it\u2019s not just me, my twitter timeline came out in sympathy to my technical woes this week with one woman admitting that in an attempt to switch off the child-locks in the back of the car, she had got stuck in the back of the car herself and had to scramble over into the front in order to escape the vehicle.\n\nThe trouble with life at the moment is that none of us mere mortals really know how to fix anything and there aren\u2019t enough experts around who can. If I can\u2019t get my wireless headphones to swap from my phone to my iPad so that I can watch Interior Design Challenge on a train, then how are we going to sort out the really big messes, the life and death stuff? There aren\u2019t enough Ethans: we are drastically short of s*** sorters.\n\nWhat we have instead are a load of blithering idiots \u2013 and I know this for a fact because I\u2019m one of them. No one has the faintest clue as to what on earth to do next. Johnson has the same look in his eyes as I have when people start talking about Bluetooth options. He\u2019s baffled, we\u2019re all baffled, if only we could stick a pin in the bottom of the country and simply restore the whole thing to its original factory settings. But sadly that\u2019s not possible and instead we are stuck forever going round in circles and feeling increasingly sick of it all.", "description": "I\u2019ve spent the past week in a state of confusion, I think we all have.
