Precise details about that complaint are elusive, even to members of the congressional intelligence committees. We know that the inspector general found the complaint to be serious enough to alert Congress about the standoff, notifying lawmakers that the complaint \u201crelates to one of the most significant and important of the [director of national intelligence]\u2019s responsibilities to the American people.\u201d We also know that Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, is resisting disclosures to lawmakers on the matter at the behest of the Justice Department.\n\nOne hypothesis is that Trump may have threatened to withhold military aid unless the Ukrainian government abetted Giuliani\u2019s skullduggery. Using the presidency to coerce a foreign power into undermining a political opponent would be, by any measure, profoundly corrupt. When asked about his calls with Zelensky on Monday, Trump gave credence to those fears. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to talk about corruption,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? [...] It\u2019s very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know everything about the substance of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, but one doesn\u2019t need to be a linguistics professor to parse Trump\u2019s meaning. Former FBI Director James Comey recounted how Trump didn\u2019t explicitly order him to do anything in 2017; the president simply asked for personal loyalty, suggested Comey should go easy on Michael Flynn, and fired him after he declined to do so. The Mueller report documented multiple instances where Trump\u2019s subordinates refused to carry out his vague commands to interfere with the Russia investigation because they knew those orders were wrong. So when the president won\u2019t shut up about anti-corruption efforts in a phone call while his lawyer also wants you to investigate a political rival, you implicitly understand that his interest isn\u2019t in clean government.\n\nMultiple Democrats responded to all of this last week by repeating their call to start impeachment proceedings against Trump. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful opposition figure in the country, did not join them. \u201cIf the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,\u201d she wrote in a letter to House members.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see why Trump and his allies should take the threat of a \u201cwhole new stage of investigation\u201d seriously. House Democrats have largely struggled to conduct investigations into the Trump administration this year. The White House responds to every request for testimony with sweeping invocations of executive privilege; the president\u2019s private and government lawyers alike reply to every subpoena or request for documents by challenging it in the federal courts. Congressional oversight requires a certain amount of good-faith participation from the executive branch to work properly. Against an authoritarian president who seems desperate to run out the clock before Election Day next year, it\u2019s virtually toothless.", "description": "Nancy Pelosi wants to be seen pushing for the president's moment of reckoning while assuring it never arrives.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/6a4bf85bfb60f1172bdfda808fc747e476cedc37.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
