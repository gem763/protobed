Officials believe they jumped in to try to save each other.\n\nSix elephants died while trying to save each other after a baby elephant fell from a waterfall in a Thai national park, officials said.\n\nStaff at Khao Yai National Park, about 85 miles northeast of Bangkok, found the roughly 3-year-old baby elephant drowned on Saturday. Five more dead elephants also were discovered at the bottom of Haew Narok Waterfall, according to the Thailand Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation.\n\nOfficials found two live elephants on the waterfall\u2019s cliff, attempting to go down to help the other elephants. A veterinarian is caring for them.\n\n\u201cThe two elephants right now are taking a rest. They are exhausted from trying to cross the stream,\u201d Chanaya Kanchanasaka, a veterinarian at the park, told the Associated Press.\n\n[A woman posted videos of herself hopping a fence to approach a zoo lion. Police want a word.]\n\nElephants are sympathetic animals that have been known to help each other when they are distressed. They also show something resembling grief when one of their own dies.\n\nThe discovery on Saturday was prompted by a report of several elephants on a nearby road, Thai officials said.\n\nThe Haew Narok Waterfall was closed to visitors after the dead elephants were discovered. It was also the site of a similar incident in 1992, when eight elephants fell to their deaths there, BBC reported.\n\nKhao Yai is Thailand\u2019s third-largest national park. Haew Narok, the park\u2019s tallest waterfall, has three tiers that total about 492 feet. Elephants are common nearby.\n\nRead more:\n\nWatch female elephants stage a dramatic rescue of a drowning baby elephant\n\nKangaroo \u2018carnage\u2019: 20 animals killed in apparent hit-and-run rampage\n\nThe creator of the labradoodle says he made \u2018Frankenstein\u2019s monster\u2019\n\nWhat makes dogs so special and successful?
