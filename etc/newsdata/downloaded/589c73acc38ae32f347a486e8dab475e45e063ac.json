The scene unfolding in front of Kemp would move her to do something she\u2019d never before done in her career on the court \u2014 a decision that later provoked both outrage and applause.\n\nKemp watched last week as the brother of Botham Jean, an unarmed black man shot to death inside his own apartment, crossed the room to hug Amber Guyger, the white former police officer convicted of murder in the case. Minutes later, after she dismissed the jury, Kemp hugged members of the Jean family. She then approached Guyger and, eventually, gifted her a Bible and embraced her, too.\n\nBoth moments went viral, and Kemp\u2019s highly unusual act elicited a split-screen response. Some praised it as a rare moment of compassion in a cold criminal justice system, while others derided it as a grave ethical breach and yet another example of how white defendants are treated better than defendants of color.\n\nOn Monday, in her first interview since the trial ended, Kemp \u2014 a former prosecutor \u2014 defended herself and said she didn\u2019t know why people were upset. Guyger asked her for the hug, she said. Kemp hesitated, then leaned in and put her arms around Guyger, who had just been sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\n\u201cFollowing my own convictions, I could not refuse that woman a hug. I would not,\u201d Kemp told the Associated Press. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t understand the anger. And I guess I could say if you profess religious beliefs and you are going to follow them, I would hope that they not be situational and limited to one race only.\u201d\n\nKemp saw a woman changed, she told the AP, someone who might seek God\u2019s forgiveness if she knew where to start, if she had a Bible of her own.\n\n\u201cShe asked me if I thought that God could forgive her and I said, \u2018Yes, God can forgive you and has,\u2019\u201d Kemp said. \u201cIf she wanted to start with the Bible, I didn\u2019t want her to go back to the jail and to sink into doubt and self-pity and become bitter. Because she still has a lot of life ahead of her following her sentence and I would hope that she could live it purposefully.\u201d\n\n[Amber Guyger\u2019s 10-year murder sentence sparks both protests and an act of forgiveness]\n\nThe judge argued that her actions were appropriate because they took place after the trial ended and were not part of the official record. But Kemp\u2019s reasoning ignores a crucial point, said South Texas College of Law professor Kenneth Williams: the trial might not be over.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Guyger could appeal the decision and the case could wind up back in front of Kemp, who may then have to recuse herself, Williams said.\n\n\u201cThere would certainly be questions about whether she\u2019s neutral and impartial,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cAs a judge, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d want to do anything to indicate that you might favor or oppose any parties in the case. I believe that by counseling Ms. Guyger, she\u2019s given that impression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s inappropriate; that\u2019s not a judge\u2019s role,\u201d Williams continued. \u201cShe should have said no. It\u2019s just not routine, this is a total aberration. In 30 years, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nKemp did not respond to interview requests from The Post, but she told the AP this was the first time she has acknowledged her Christianity to a defendant or given one a Bible.\n\n\u201cYou can have mine,\u201d Kemp told Guyger, handing her the book. \u201cI\u2019ve got three or four more at home. This is the one I use every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t done so much that you can\u2019t be forgiven,\u201d the judge added, according to a reporter in the room. \u201cYou did something bad in one moment in time. What you do now matters.\u201d\n\nKemp flipped to a page in the New Testament \u2014 John 3:16, a well-known verse highlighting God\u2019s love \u2014 and said, \u201cThis is where you start.\u201d She picked that passage, she told the AP, so Guyger \"could recognize that, even given the fact that she murdered someone, God still loves her.\u201d\n\nThe exchange pushed the Freedom From Religion Foundation, which regularly files lawsuits defending the separation of church and state, to log a complaint with the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct.\n\nKemp, the group wrote, was \u201cproselytizing in her official capacity\u201d and her actions \u201coverstepped judicial authority, were inappropriate and were unconstitutional.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is perfectly acceptable for private citizens to express their religious beliefs in court, but the rules are different for those acting in a governmental role ... it violates a vital constitutional principle for a sitting judge to promote personal religious beliefs while acting in her official capacity,\" the complaint read.\n\nOthers argued that the dramatic courtroom encounter took the focus off the Jean family and made Guyger a sympathetic figure.\n\n\u201cIt definitely was a boon to Ms. Guyger,\u201d Williams said.\n\n[Amber Guyger was hugged by her victim\u2019s brother and a judge, igniting a debate about forgiveness and race]\n\nAnd it further exacerbates the criminal justice system\u2019s racial divide, where leniency is more often afforded to white defendants.\n\n\u201cThe issue is not so much that compassion was extended to Amber Guyger. It\u2019s that compassion is often withheld from black people in similar situations,\u201d Jemar Tisby, an African American historian and writer, said in an interview with NPR.\n\nKemp, a Democrat, first ran for judge in 2014 \u2014 a decision she made after she fasted and prayed, the AP reported. A graduate of the University of Oklahoma\u2019s law school, she worked in the Dallas County district attorney\u2019s office for about 15 years before launching her campaign.\n\nShe defeated the Democratic incumbent in the primary and ran unopposed in the general election. Four years later, she easily won reelection, earning an endorsement from the editorial board of the Dallas Morning News, which praised her efficient management of court business. Kemp hasn\u2019t said whether she plans to seek a third term.\n\nRead more:\n\nAmber Guyger, police officer who shot a man to death in his apartment, found guilty of murder\n\nInside the jury room, an agonizing deliberation to sentence Amber Guyger", "description": "in her first interview since the trial ended, Judge Tammy Kemp defended herself and said she didn\u2019t know why people were upset.", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter", "October At Pm", "Reis Thebault Is A Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News.
