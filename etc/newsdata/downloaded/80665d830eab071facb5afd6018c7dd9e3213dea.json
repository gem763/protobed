In fact, Salesforce has a unique 1:1:1 model, meaning 1% of profits, 1% of equity, and 1% of employees' time go toward each office's community.\n\nThe importance of giving back trickles down to Salesforce's hiring process, too. According to Recio, leaders want to make sure every new hire's values align with Salesforce's.\n\nTo that end, she asks almost every interviewee three open-ended questions.\n\n1. What are the values that drive you?\n\nOnce the person has responded, Recio asks a slightly more challenging question: \"When did you feel like those values were compromised in a professional environment?\"\n\nMore often than not, Recio told Business Insider, the question \"gives them pause.\"\n\nRecio's prompts are similar to the questions Justin Angsuwat asks job candidates.\n\nAngsuwat is the VP of people at Thumbtack and a former Google HR exec. He previously told Business Insider that one of his go-to interview questions is, \"What's a company or a personal value you hold really strongly and what's the toughest trade-off you've made to uphold that value?\"\n\nThe goal, for both Angsuwat and Recio, is to see how strongly people hew to their values \u2014 or not \u2014 in challenging situations.\n\nRead more: A Salesforce exec who hires more than 8,000 people a year shares one question she asks every job candidate\n\n2. What is your purpose?\n\nThis existential question stumps many people, Recio said.\n\nBut it's important to show candidates that Salesforce seeks \"leaders who are not just looking to be extraordinary professionally,\" Recio added. \"Your purpose could be a broader personal purpose. It can be about making an impact, on a broader scale, on the community.\"\n\nIf they're excited about answering this question, that's a good sign.\n\nRead more: Lyft's COO interviews tons of people who want to work for the company. Here's one of his favorite questions, and the answer he's looking for.\n\n3. What was your best professional day ever?\n\nThis question is similar to something Facebook interviewers ask to find a good match for a candidate's passions: \"On your very best day at work \u2014 the day you come home and think you have the best job in the world \u2014 what did you do that day?\"\n\nAs Miranda Kalinowski, Facebook's global head of recruiting, previously told Business Insider's Rich Feloni, people are more likely to stay at a company where they're making an impact, and \"learning and growing and doing work they love.\"\n\nRecio has observed that the majority of Salesforce candidates will describe \"a scenario that doesn't involve them,\" for example, when they gave a deserving employee a raise or their team achieved a seemingly impossible outcome.\n\nAnd while that type of answer suggests that a candidate is a team player, Recio is also happy to hear about more individual experiences, like the day someone got promoted.\n\nPeople's answers speak to their values, Recio said, and \"what's really important to them.\"", "description": "Salesforce is one of the most desirable employers in the US.
