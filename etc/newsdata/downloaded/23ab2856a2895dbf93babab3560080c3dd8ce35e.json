The shared-office company is having a harder time convincing potential public-market investors it\u2019s worth even half that much ahead of a planned initial public offering. Here are some of the issues investors are weighing as they scrutinize the business and growth prospects of We, which declined to comment.\n\nIn 2018, We took in $1.8 billion in revenue\u2014but for every dollar the company generated, it spent nearly two.

However, a company\u2019s ability to show that losses are slowing or shrinking\u2014even as the company grows\u2014often gives investors comfort the business is sound, and will eventually turn a profit. Many companies that went public this year show a widening gap between revenues and operating losses\u2014but the two measures are growing in tandem for We.\n\nQuarterly revenue and operating loss/income, leading up to IPO We $807.8M $800 million Secondary stock- compensation expense Revenue 600 (Operating loss) $729.7M 400 200 0 1Q \u201917 \u201918 \u201919 2016 $600 million Lyft Pinterest* Slack 400 200 0 1Q \u201918 2Q \u201918 \u201919 1Q \u201918 2017 2017 2017 *Had operating income in 4Q 2017 and 4Q 2018 Source: the companies Quarterly revenue and operating loss/income, leading up to IPO We $807.8M $800 million Secondary stock- compensation expense 600 Revenue $729.7M (Operating loss) 400 200 0 1Q \u201917 \u201918 \u201919 2016 $600 million Lyft Pinterest* Slack 400 200 0 1Q \u201918 2Q \u201918 \u201919 1Q \u201918 2017 2017 2017 *Had operating income in 4Q 2017 and 4Q 2018 Source: the companies Quarterly revenue and operating loss/income, leading up to IPO We $807.8M $800 million Secondary stock- compensation expense Revenue 600 (Operating loss) $729.7M 400 200 0 1Q \u201917 \u201918 \u201919 2016 $600 million Lyft Pinterest* Slack 400 200 0 1Q \u201918 2Q \u201918 \u201919 1Q \u201918 2017 2017 2017 *Had operating income in 4Q 2017 and 4Q 2018 Source: the companies Quarterly revenue and operating loss/income, leading up to IPO Revenue (Operating loss) We $807.8M $800 billion Secondary stock- compensation expense 600 400 $729.7M 200 0 1Q \u201917 \u201918 \u201919 2016 $600 million Lyft Pinterest* 400 200 0 \u201918 1Q 1Q \u201918 2017 2017 Slack $200 million *Had operating income in 4Q 2017 and 4Q 2018 0 2Q \u201918 \u201919 2017 Source: the companies\n\nWe is raising increasingly large sums...\n\nWe has raised more than $10 billion in nine years by turning to venture capital firms, then banks, then mutual funds and ultimately SoftBank.
