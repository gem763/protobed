As temperatures dip, my desire for everything autumnal and cozy rises. But I'm not talking Pumpkin Spice lattes.\n\nI like to head outside to savor the changing leaves while wrapped in a soft sweater. Ideally, I'll make a trip out of it, and book a cozy Airbnb in Upstate New York, near the Hudson River Valley, Catskills, or other quaint towns.\n\nIf you're like me, you'll want to jump on the following listings.

All are highly rated Airbnb listings in Upstate New York with a review score of 4.7 or higher. Pack your marshmallows - each Airbnb has a fireplace. Properties are unique and encourage coziness - think cabins, cottages, chalets, and more.\n\nMost will require a car. However if you're that kind of New Yorker who doesn't own one, or never puts their license to use (ahem, hi, me), don't let that come between you and a crackling fireplace. Car rental deals are always available, or with some creative planning, homes should be reachable by train or commuter rail, followed by flagging down a local cab or rideshare. For the latter, call ahead. Cell service can sometimes be spotty upstate.\n\nIt's worth noting that cleaning and service fees vary widely from one Airbnb to another. This can drastically impact the final price. Additionally, other weekends may cost more or less, depending on availability.\n\nOnce you're \"home,\" all properties are close to charming Hudson Valley or Catskill towns, hiking, antiquing, and farm-to-fork fare. Though with affordable Airbnbs this adorable, we won't be surprised if you choose to hole up all weekend instead.\n\nKeep reading to book any of these 12 Airbnbs for every price point, ranging from $93 to $350 a night.", "description": "These 12 Airbnbs in Upstate New York are charming, cozy cabins, and cottages, ranging from $100 to $350 a night, within three hours of New York.", "authors": ["Emily Hochberg"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d81004d2e22af41ad15d856-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
