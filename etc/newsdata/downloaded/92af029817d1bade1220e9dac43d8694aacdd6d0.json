Gil Cisneros of California, a former naval officer; Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, a former Army Ranger; Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, a former Air Force officer; Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, a former naval officer; Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, a former Navy helicopter pilot; Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, a former CIA analyst; and Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, a former CIA officer, signed the article published in The Washington Post and described the recent allegations against Trump as \"unprecedented.\"\n\nReporting by The Post and other news organizations over the past week has uncovered the existence of the whistleblower complaint said to involve Trump's communications with a world leader involving Ukraine.\n\nThe complaint's specific allegations have not made public, but Trump has confirmed discussing former Vice President Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter during a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The details have led to accusations that Trump improperly sought to enlist a foreign nation to harm a political opponent, as the elder Biden has long been the 2020 Democratic presidential frontrunner.\n\nA separate Washington Post story published Monday reported that Trump had temporarily withheld nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine shortly before the July phone call, opening the possibility of a quid pro quo.\n\nRep.

And that is what we intend to do.\"\n\nCalls for House Democrats to begin formal investigative proceedings on impeachment have intensified. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to convene several meetings Tuesday to discuss whether the party will issue a formal condemnation of Trump's actions.\n\nPelosi, who read the op-ed article during her flight from New York to Washington, DC, on Monday, declined to say whether she would back an impeachment inquiry but suggested \"we will have no choice,\" according to CNN.", "description": "\"Our lives have been defined by national service,\" the Democrats said in the column. \"We are not career politicians.\"", "authors": ["David Choi"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d89940c2e22af33c8464575-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
