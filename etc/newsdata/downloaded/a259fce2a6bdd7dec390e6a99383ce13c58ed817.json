The jobless rate, which had been stuck at 3.7 per cent for three straight months, declined even as 117,000 people entered the labour force last month.\n\nNonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 jobs last month, the government's survey of establishments showed. The economy created 45,000 more jobs in July and August than previously estimated. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would increase by 145,000 jobs in September.\n\nSeptember's job gains were below the monthly average of 161,000 this year, but still above the roughly 100,000 needed each month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The smaller household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived showed a jump of 391,000 in employment in September.\n\nWith signs that the Trump administration's 15-month trade war with China is spilling over to the broader economy, continued labour market strength is a critical buffer against an economic downturn. The trade war has eroded business confidence, sinking investment and manufacturing.\n\nThere is also political uncertainty in Washington after the Democratic-controlled US House of Representatives launched an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump after accusations he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former US Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThese factors, together with benign wage inflation, are likely to prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at least one more time this year, economists said. The US central bank cut rates last month after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008, to keep the economic expansion, now in its 11th year, on track.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We continue to expect the Fed to cut its target interest rate later this month,\" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. \"We believe it would have taken a much stronger number to convince Fed leadership that they have already taken out enough insurance against downside risks.\"\n\nEconomic growth estimates for the third quarter range from as low as a 1.3 per cent annualised rate to as high as a 1.9 per cent pace. The economy grew at a 2.0 per cent pace in the second quarter, slowing from a 3.1 per cent rate in the January-March period.\n\nSlower growth was reinforced by a report from the Commerce Department on Friday that showed the US trade deficit widened 1.6 per cent to $US54.9 billion in August.\n\nA broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, declined to 6.9 per cent last month, the lowest level since December 2000, from 7.2 per cent in August.\n\nDespite the tight labour market, average hourly earnings were unchanged last month after advancing 0.4 per cent in August. That lowered the annual increase in wages to 2.9 per cent from 3.2 per cent in August. The average workweek was unchanged at 34.4 hours.\n\nSome economists believe wage growth is stalling because companies are hiring inexperienced workers in the face of labour shortages. Others blame the slowdown on ebbing demand for workers.\n\n\"With demand for labour softening and many companies contending with higher input costs as the trade war lingers and broadens, we do not expect to see any meaningful strengthening in wage growth in the coming months,\" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nHiring is slowing across all sectors, with the exception of government, which is being boosted by state and local government recruitment. Private payrolls increased by 114,000 jobs in September after rising by 122,000 in August.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe three-month average gain in private employment fell to 119,000, the smallest since July 2012, from 135,000 in August.\n\nManufacturing shed 2000 jobs last month, the first decline in factory payrolls since March, after hiring 2000 workers in August. Factory employment growth has slowed from last year's brisk pace. Manufacturing has ironically borne the brunt of the Trump administration's trade war, which the White House has argued is intended to boost the sector.\n\nLast month's decline in manufacturing payrolls was led by the automotive sector, which lost 4100 jobs. Further losses are likely if a strike by General Motors workers continues.\n\nThere were also job losses in machinery, fabricated metals products and primary metal industries.\n\nConstruction employment increased by 7000 jobs last month after rising by 4000 in August. Retail payrolls dropped by 11,400 jobs, shedding employment for an eighth straight month.\n\nGovernment employment increased by 22,000 jobs in September after surging by 46,000 in August. Hiring was boosted by state and local governments. Only 1000 workers were hired last month for the 2020 Census. Government payrolls have increased by 147,000 over the year, driven by local governments.\n\nReuters", "description": "Jobs growth moderated in September, though the pace of growth could help the world's largest economy avoid a recession for now.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f8a71aecf9039eac7681c17b479a3a31cb8dcdbd", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
