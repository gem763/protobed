Nearly \u00a38bn taken from council budgets for social care since 2010.\n\n\"The result is one million people not getting the care they need. 87 people dying a day waiting for care More than five million unpaid carers looking after loved ones.\n\n\"And overworked, underpaid care workers only being allowed ten minute visits to those they care for because the current system won\u2019t pay for more.\"\n\nThe shadow chancellor will add: \"As the first building block in our new National Care Service, the next Labour government will introduce personal care free at the point of use in England.\n\n\"Funded not through the Conservatives\u2019 gimmicky insurance schemes, but, like the NHS and our other essentials, through general taxation.\"\n\nCurrently, only people with low levels of savings receive publicly-funded personal care,\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
