(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nTHE KEY\n\nSome Senate Democrats see an opening to take action on election interference following the release yesterday of a mammoth new report outlining Russian disinformation efforts in the 2016 election.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been blocking the most expansive of those efforts, arguing that states shouldn't be forced to adopt federal election mandates. But the Republican leader has been less adamant about combating disinformation.\n\nBut some key Democrats say the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee's bipartisan report -- which offers a damning portrait of efforts by Russia\u2019s propaganda arm that only increased after the election -- provides an opening. Activity by accounts linked to Russia\u2019s notorious Internet Research Agency jumped 200 percent on Instagram after the election and 50 percent on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, the committee found.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of new awakening, if you will, about the magnitude of the problem we\u2019re facing and I certainly hope this report will help stimulate some movement,\u201d Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), a member of the committee, told me.\n\nThe timing of the report's release could also be auspicious. McConnell recently eased his hard line by endorsing $250 million in extra money for states to secure their elections but without mandating any particular cybersecurity protections such as paper ballots or post-election audits.\n\n\u201cThere may be some softening of his position and the fact this report was unanimous is very significant. This came from a very diverse committee and the findings are unequivocal,\u201d King said.\n\nMcConnell's far from on board yet, however.\n\nA McConnell spokesman declined to discuss specific disinformation bills and pointed me to a CNBC interview last week in which McConnell praised Trump administration efforts to protect the 2018 election as \u201ca big success story\u201d and said he\u2019s \u201cconvinced we\u2019re ready for 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny foreign country that messes with us will have a serious problem in return,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nThe new report, spearheaded by Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and ranking Democrat Mark Warner (Va.), outlines several ways lawmakers could take action to tighten election security. It presses for Congress to consider legislation to help block Russia and other adversaries from buying online political ads and to foster cooperation between social media companies and law enforcement \u2014 though it doesn\u2019t endorse any particular bills.\n\nAnd some Republicans have previously supported more robust action aimed at 2020.\n\nSoon after the report came out, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) took to Twitter to tout the Honest Ads Act, which would mandate transparency about who pays for online political advertisements. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) is a co-sponsor.\n\nA Burr aide declined to speculate on any next steps the Senate might take and Graham's office didn't respond to a query about whether he'll push the Senate to consider his bill.\n\nWe have a common set of facts about what happened, and we know that there is a continued threat against our democracy. What we need to do now is address these facts with a common purpose\u2014to protect our democracy.-AK #ElectionSecurity https://t.co/If4ZPwGCfD \u2014 Senator Amy Klobuchar (@SenAmyKlobuchar) October 8, 2019\n\nWarner also put out a clarion call for Senate action, warning that \u201cCongress must step up and establish guardrails to protect the integrity of our democracy.\u201d\n\nAs was made clear in 2016, we cannot expect social media companies to take adequate precautions on their own. Congress must step up and establish guardrails to protect the integrity of our democracy.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what the Committee recommends on a bipartisan basis: \u2014 Mark Warner (@MarkWarner) October 8, 2019\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the report \u201cmakes it crystal clear to everyone that Vladimir Putin exploited social media to spread false information in the 2016 elections and that the Senate must take action to ensure Americans know who is behind online political ads to help prevent it from happening again.\u201d\n\nHe also attacked McConnell for \u201cblock[ing] a full-throated U.S. response.\u201d\n\nCongressional action is also likely to be complicated by the House impeachment inquiry into whether Trump improperly leaned on Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Trump has routinely lashed out at any talk of Russia\u2019s 2016 interference operations, arguing that it takes away from his come-from-behind election victory.\n\nAnd Trump's push back on disinformation could make those efforts even more effective in 2020.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we found as a committee is that probably the best defense against disinformation is citizens being informed about the fact they\u2019re being misinformed \u2026 and taking it with a grain of salt,\u201d King told me. \u201cFor the president to continue to deny this, he\u2019s disarming the country. He\u2019s disarming one of the best defenses we have.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Cybersecurity 202, our must-read newsletter on cybersecurity policy news.

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nPINGED: A secret intelligence court ruled last year that some FBI searches of thousands of pieces of raw intelligence violated the constitutional rights of Americans, Dustin Volz and Byron Tau at the Wall Street Journal report. The ruling \u2014 disclosed by the intelligence community Tuesday \u2014 marks a rare censure of U.S. surveillance activities and prompted fresh criticism of the FBI\u2019s oversight of the program.\n\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court found between 2017 and 2018 that the FBI was conducting searches targeting Americans that may have violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches. The searches also could have run afoul of the law authorizing the program, which requires that warrantless searches of the surveillance database be backed by criminal investigations or in pursuit of foreign intelligence information. In one case, a contractor used the highly secretive database to search for himself and relatives, Dustin and Byron report.\n\nThe disclosure of the ruling reignited criticism of the controversial legal provision authorizing the program, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Some senators argued the revelations underscore why Section 702 should not have been renewed earlier this year.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s release demonstrates how baseless the FBI\u2019s position was and highlights Congress\u2019 constitutional obligation to act independently and strengthen the checks and balances on government surveillance,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) wrote. He also expressed concern that the remaining redacted portions of the court opinion contains additional information \u201cthe public deserves to know.\u201d\n\nRep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who moved to let the program expire, criticized President Trump for pushing to reauthorize it.\n\nThis is FISA 702. In 2018, I led the charge against the establishment to stop this program. President Trump attacked my efforts and signed it into law, with the support of Ryan, Pelosi, McCarthy, Nunes, and Schiff. It\u2019s an outrageous violation of our Constitution and our rights. https://t.co/gv0EvEk5Yb \u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) October 8, 2019\n\nTwitter logo (Photo by LOIC VENANCE / AFP)LOIC VENANCE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPATCHED: Twitter may have \"inadvertently\" taken emails and phone numbers users shared with the company for cybersecurity purposes and used them for advertising, the company revealed in a blog post yesterday. The company says it didn\u2019t share any personal data with the advertisers and that it ended the practice last month.\n\nBut the privacy gaffe could still land the company in hot water with federal regulators, my colleague Tony Romm reports. The Federal Trade Commission penalized Facebook in a similar case for failing to disclose that it took phone numbers users provided to verify their identities and used them to target the users with advertisements. The FTC could also slap Twitter with heavy fines if the agency finds the recent incident violates the terms of a 2011 settlement between the agency and the social media giant.\n\nThis isn't Twitter's first recent data security problem. The company temporarily accidentally disabled settings allowing users to protect tweets for Android users in January. Months later the company revealed it was \"inadvertently collecting and sharing iOS location data\" with an unnamed party. The company fixed both issues.\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State Alex Padilla. (Rich Pedroncelli/Associated Press)\n\nPWNED: California\u2019s top election official is urging political parties to ramp up cybersecurity protections, including boosting employee training and mandating secure logins to protect upcoming primaries and the 2020 geleral elections.\n\n\"Elections administrators cannot be alone in the fight against malicious actors who seek to undermine our elections,\" California Secretary of State Alex Padilla writes in letters to Repulican and Democratic party chairs.\n\nThe letter comes as national political parties are also boosting efforts to ensure campaigns are protected against foreign hacking in 2020. The Democratic National Committee has issued a checklist of basic protocols for campaigns and organized trainings. The National Republican Congressional Committee has pledged hands-on cybersecurity assistance for campaigns.\n\nBut hacking efforts may just be getting started.
