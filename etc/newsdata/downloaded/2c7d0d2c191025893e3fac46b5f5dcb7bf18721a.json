But she will also be in charge of coordinating the EU\u2019s fragmented defense industry on research and development projects to help plug the bloc\u2019s many military capability gaps and make it less reliant on U.S. technology.\n\nBy connecting the defense and space remit with wider industrial policy and putting a former French defense minister in the driver\u2019s seat, the nomination suggests a determination to promote \u201cEuropean champions\u201d capable of competing eye-to-eye with the giants of the U.S. military industrial complex.\n\n\"The Commission is not making a power grab for defense policy or creating an EU army\" \u2014 Outgoing Internal Market Commissioner El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska\n\nAs a result, Goulard is likely to come under friendly fire from several directions: member states jealous of their control over national defense budgets, armed forces and defense policy; NATO officials concerned that non-EU allies will be excluded from military R&D projects; and a U.S. administration that wants to sell more weapons to Europe and accuses Brussels of discriminating against its companies.\n\nFor almost six decades, the EU has done butter, not guns. Spending EU resources on military hardware or even defense research was taboo. That changed after Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea and the destabilization of Ukraine in 2014 revived the specter of a military threat from the east, and Britain\u2019s 2016 vote to leave the EU removed a long-standing brake on closer European defense integration.\n\nAll EU countries except Britain, Denmark and Cyprus agreed in 2017 to move forward with so-called permanent structured cooperation in defense, signing up to commitments to spend more and work together to plug gaps in areas such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, drones, airlift, cyberwarfare, space-based information and communications.\n\nProvided national governments and the European Parliament agree, the draft seven-year EU budget from 2021 allocates \u20ac13 billion to a European Defense Fund (EDF) to promote cross-border collaboration on defense research and technology projects, plus another \u20ac6.5 billion to upgrade roads, bridges, rail lines, ports and airports for so-called military mobility, and \u20ac16 billion on space programs.\n\nGoulard was armed forces minister for just five weeks but that was long enough to get a whiff of the ingrained resistance in the French military-industrial complex to European cooperation.\n\nOutgoing Internal Market Commissioner El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska, who had defense industries and space as part of her beat, stressed that the Commission is not making a power grab for defense policy or creating an EU army \u2014 despite occasional loose talk by Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Member states would continue to set their own military requirements, pick their suppliers and determine their own arms export rules.\n\n\u201cOf course, we see and discuss the bigger picture, but we are just starting from zero,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the ambition will be much bigger for the next five years. We need to get established on the ground.\u201d\n\nBie\u0144kowska had hoped that skirmishes over participation by companies from third countries such as NATO allies Norway, Turkey, the U.S. and Canada \u2014 as well as post-Brexit Britain \u2014 had ended in April when EU governments and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement on the rules governing the functioning of the EDF and the accompanying European Defense Industrial Development Program.\n\nBut conflict erupted again in May when Washington fired a thunderbolt accusing Brussels of \u201ca dramatic reversal\u201d of three decades of transatlantic defense integration and inserting \u201cpoison pills\u201d to restrict U.S. companies from participating in European projects, and threatening retaliation.\n\nThe undersecretaries of state and defense warned that the EU plan would produce duplication, non-interoperable military systems, divert scarce defense resources and create unnecessary competition between the EU and NATO. The tone, timing and content of the U.S. letter caused surprise at both EU and NATO headquarters, since the two organizations have been working more closely together in the last two years than at any time in their history.\n\nThe issue has dropped out of the headlines but it will be prominent in Goulard\u2019s in-tray, along with persistent suspicions of protectionism and favoritism among non-EU European nations.\n\nPerhaps only a top-down industrial restructuring, driven by Paris and a post-Merkel government in Berlin, can break the logjam.\n\nGoulard was armed forces minister for just five weeks but that was long enough to get a whiff of the ingrained resistance in the French military-industrial complex to European cooperation. Historic enmities run deep among European arms makers and within individual countries \u2014 such as between aerospace companies Dassault Aviation and Airbus in France, or armored vehicle makers Rheinmetall and KMW (formerly Krauss Maffei) in Germany.\n\nOther member states, notably the Nordic and Baltic countries, the Netherlands, and Poland, are suspicious of Franco-German efforts to press EU countries to buy European rather than U.S. equipment.\n\nThe Dutch and Nordics say they simply want the best value for money and quality for their limited defense budgets. Swedish aircraft maker Saab is heavily integrated into the U.S. defense supply chain. The Poles and Balts believe they get an unspoken extra level of bilateral defense insurance if they buy U.S. equipment beyond NATO\u2019s mutual defense clause.\n\nMany defense experts doubt whether the EDF seed money will be sufficient to trigger bottom-up pan-European integration, given the urge to preserve defense jobs, know-how and military autonomy in member states. Perhaps only a top-down industrial restructuring, driven by Paris and a post-Merkel government in Berlin, can break the logjam.\n\nEither way, Goulard will need a strong flak jacket as she sets out to make Europe\u2019s defense industry more effective, more rational and more autonomous.\n\nPaul Taylor, contributing editor at POLITICO, writes the Europe At Large column.", "description": "Sylvie Goulard\u2019s defense industry brief flags EU ambition, but risks crossfire.", "authors": ["Paul Taylor", "Mark Scott", "Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli", "Thibault Larger", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Goulard188x151-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
