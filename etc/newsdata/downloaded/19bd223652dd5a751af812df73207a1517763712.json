Thrones is an Emmys juggernaut \u2013 it won for best drama series in its last three eligible seasons (2015, 2016, and 2018) and is nominated for 32 awards this year, the most for any single season of television, ever. (The show already won ten awards at last weekend\u2019s Creative Arts Emmys). The question this year, however, is whether the majority of the 24,000 Emmy voters will still reward Game of Thrones after a divisive, narratively uneven final season. That\u2019s likely to be the case, especially with traditional rivals such as The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Stranger Things, and The Americans no longer in the running. But younger, smaller shows could spoil the victory lap; HBO\u2019s other entry, Succession, received five nominations for its critically acclaimed first season, and BBC America\u2019s Killing Eve could ride a solid second season and the wave of popularity for stars Sandra Oh, Jodie Comer, and creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge to a win. Other nominees Better Call Saul, Pose, Ozark, This Is Us, and Bodyguard all have sizable audiences and, for the most part, critical praise, but likely lack the momentum to topple Westerosi dominance.\n\nEmmys 2019: Game of Thrones leads race with record 32 nominations Read more\n\nWill win: Game of Thrones\n\nShould win: Succession\n\nOutstanding Comedy Series\n\nIt\u2019s a testament to the ever-expanding state of comedy in 2019 that despite a near-total turnover in nominees, last year\u2019s most competitive category remains as tight and stacked this year. The only returning nominees from 2018 are HBO\u2019s critically adored Barry and the defending champion, Amazon\u2019s The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. The 50s-set comedy, with 20 nominations, has broad support among Emmy voters, but as in outstanding drama, the sentimental favorite here is a beloved HBO series in its final season: Veep. Veep has won twice already, and though its final season was, like Game of Thrones, not of its previous caliber, the series could still win based on the popularity of its star, Emmys mainstay Julia Louis-Dreyfus.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the second season of Amazon\u2019s Fleabag. Photograph: BBC/Two Brothers/Steve Schofield\n\nBut both frontrunners contend with several strong, and popular, new entries. Barry\u2019s brilliant dark comedy \u2013 Bill Hader as a hit man trying to become an actor \u2013 could take home a win for its second season, as could the searing sophomore season of Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s Fleabag. And Russian Doll, shepherded by comedy veterans Natasha Lyonne and Amy Poehler, enjoyed a splashy, moment-seizing debut early this year. Schitt\u2019s Creek and The Good Place, though broadly appealing, are long shots.\n\nWill win: The Marvelous Mrs Maisel\n\nShould win: Fleabag\n\nOutstanding Limited Series\n\nIt\u2019s a year of strong entries for limited series: the moody, ephemeral Sharp Objects topped several critics list (though its Emmys stock has dropped considerably since the show premiered in summer 2018), Showtime\u2019s Escape from Dannemora earned solid, if not overwhelming, positive interest, and Fosse/Verdon effectively revised the history of a storied Broadway partnership. But there\u2019s really just two options for the Emmy, both 80s-set historical dramas that mine famous tragedies for searing cultural and political relevance. Will voters go for HBO\u2019s meticulously crafted, expertly adapted Chernobyl? Or the wounding, pristine When They See Us, Ava DuVernay\u2019s mini-series on the Central Park Five?\n\nWill win: Chernobyl\n\nShould win: When They See Us\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Drama\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer in Killing Eve. Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nWith last year\u2019s champion, Claire Foy, and Elisabeth Moss not in contention, the race for best dramatic actress is fairly wide open, though given her recent Golden Globe and SAG awards, Sandra Oh in Killing Eve is the favorite. Oh\u2019s most likely rival is her costar, Jodie Comer, whose scene-stealing turn as the serial contract killer Villanelle only turned more heads in the second season. Emmy voters could, however, choose to reward Emilia Clarke, nominated four times but with no wins, for her nearly decade-long work \u2013 and an especially heavy lift in the final season \u2013 as Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones. There\u2019s an outside chance each for established awards favorites Laura Linney (Ozark) and Viola Davis (How to Get Away With Murder). Mandy Moore\u2019s nomination is already a win for This Is Us, and it seems unlikely Emmy voters will pick Robin Wright (House of Cards) for a show that has faded significantly.\n\nWill win: Sandra Oh (Killing Eve)\n\nShould win: Jodie Comer (Killing Eve)\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Drama\n\nThis could be Odenkirk\u2019s year \u2013 the much-loved star of Breaking Bad spinoff Better Call Saul has lost three previous nominations (to Jon Hamm, Rami Malek, and Sterling K Brown). But Billy Porter\u2019s electric performance in Pose could sway voters, and never count out a representative from Westeros (Harington has never won for his portrayal of Jon Snow on Game of Thrones). Bateman, as the director-star of Ozark, has years of TV cred playing in his favor, while Sterling K Brown\u2019s performance in This Is Us has already garnered him the award. Milo Ventimiglia\u2019s nomination is, like his co-star Mandy Moore\u2019s, itself a win for the lone network series represented in the category.\n\nWill win: Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul)\n\nShould win: Billy Porter (Pose)\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy\n\nThis year will mark either a triumphant return to tradition or a changing of the guard for best comedy actress. The obvious favorite is Julia Louis-Dreyfus for the final season of Veep. Louis-Dreyfus has won six (six!) times prior for her role as Selina Meyer, though a year of ineligibility last year opened up the door for Rachel Brosnahan as the star of The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. In any other year, Brosnahan could confidently assume a repeat, but competition this year is stiff, even outside of Louis-Dreyfus. Phoebe Waller-Bridge was luminous as the triple threat creator/writer/star of Fleabag. Natasha Lyonne had a breakout year in Russian Doll, and Catherine O\u2019Hara \u2013 who last won an Emmy in 1981 \u2013 has decades of goodwill and a passionate fanbase for Schitt\u2019s Creek on her side. Christina Applegate (Dead To Me) is unlikely to eke out a win, but crazier things have happened.\n\nWill win: Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Veep)\n\nShould win: Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Veep) or Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Fleabag)\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bill Hader as a hitman turned struggling actor in Barry. Photograph: HBO\n\nLast year\u2019s winner, Bill Hader, returns again with a strong case for the second season of Barry, though he could be unseated by two popular TV veterans: Ted Danson, for network darling The Good Place, and Eugene Levy of cult-favorite Schitt\u2019s Creek. If anyone outside those three were to score an upset, it would likely be Michael Douglas (The Kominsky Method), a six-time nominee who last won in 2013 for Behind the Candelabra. Don Cheadle (Black Monday) and Anthony Anderson (black-ish) have each delivered solid work beyond their respective TV seasons, but that\u2019s unlikely to stem the tide of support for Hader, Danson or Levy.\n\nWill win: Bill Hader (Barry)\n\nShould win: Bill Hader (Barry)\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or TV Movie\n\nYet another strong category pits industry favorites \u2013 Patricia Arquette (Showtime\u2019s Escape from Dannemora), Michelle Williams (FX\u2019s Fosse/Verdon) \u2013 against relative newcomers \u2013 Joey King (Hulu\u2019s The Act) and Aunjanue Ellis (Netflix\u2019s When They See Us). Williams likely has the edge, given the overwhelming critical praise for her portrayal of old Hollywood\u2019s Gwen Verdon. But awards regular Arquette, also nominated for best supporting actress in a limited series for The Act, might eke out the win. The prospects for Amy Adams, once a frontrunner, have dimmed in the more than year since Sharp Objects premiered. Niecy Nash is also a possible spoiler for When They See Us.\n\nWill win: Michelle Williams (Fosse/Verdon)\n\nShould win: Michelle Williams (Fosse/Verdon)\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or TV Movie\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jharrel Jerome in When They See Us. Photograph: Atsushi Nishijima/Netflix\n\nBenicio Del Toro (Escape at Dannemora), Hugh Grant (A Very English Scandal), Sam Rockwell (Fosse/Verdon), and Mahershala Ali (True Detective) all achieved solid performances, but go up against the surging popularity for actors from the two defining mini-series of the year: Jared Harris of Chernobyl and Jharrel Jerome of When They See Us. The winner likely depends on the outcome of best limited series: the Emmys will want to reward When They See Us somewhere, and Jerome\u2019s turn, as the only actor to carry his character through the full series arc, was devastating.\n\nWill win: Jharrel Jerome (When They See Us)\n\nShould win: Jharrel Jerome (When They See Us) or Jared Harris (Chernobyl)\n\nOutstanding Variety Talk Series\n\nAt this point, all the nominated variety talk series either cover basically the same political material \u2013 Trump and his headline-grabbing scandals, from Sharpie-edited maps to the Mueller report \u2013 or riff on friendly celebrity chats and games. The two exceptions are the weeklies \u2013 Full Frontal With Samantha Bee (TBS) and HBO\u2019s Last Week Tonight with John Oliver \u2013 which have more time to select and dig deeper into larger, more opaque subjects. Emmy voters are more likely to reward John Oliver\u2019s unabashed, absolutely no-bullshit HBO show, but the real outstanding star is Colbert, whose consistency five nights a week outpaces all the other hosts.\n\nWill win: Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\n\nShould win: The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\n\nOutstanding supporting actor in a comedy series\n\nAnthony Carrigan (Barry)\n\nStephen Root (Barry) \u2013 Will win\n\nHenry Winkler (Barry)\n\nAlan Arkin (The Kominsky Method)\n\nTony Shalhoub (The Marvelous Mrs Maisel) \u2013 Should win\n\nTony Hale (Veep)\n\nOutstanding supporting actress in a comedy series\n\nSarah Goldberg (Barry)\n\nSian Clifford (Fleabag)\n\nOlivia Coleman (Fleabag)\n\nBetty Gilpin (GLOW)\n\nAlex Borstein (The Marvelous Mrs Maisel) \u2013 Will win\n\nMarin Hinkle (The Marvelous Mrs Maisel)\n\nKate McKinnon (Saturday Night Live)\n\nAnna Chlumsky (Veep) \u2013 Should win\n\nOutstanding supporting actor in a drama series\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Peter Dinklage in Game of Thrones.
