Giampa had dated Kuhn-Fricker\u2019s then-16-year-old daughter and attended class with her at a school for teens with emotional and learning issues. Police say Giampa then shot himself in the head.\n\nThe daughter, who is now 17, testified at Tuesday\u2019s hearing about witnessing the shooting. Judge Kimberly J. Daniel excluded the media and public from the courtroom after prosecutors argued the publicity would be detrimental to her recovery after the incident.\n\nProsecutors did not offer a motive for the shooting Tuesday, but family and friends of Kuhn-Fricker said she staged an intervention to keep her daughter from seeing Giampa the week of the shootings, after discovering a Twitter account and messages tied to Giampa that showed a fascination with Nazis and espoused hatred of Jews, blacks and gays.\n\n\u201cI would feel a little bad reporting him if his online access was to basically be a normal teen, but he is a monster, and I have no pity for people like that,\u201d Kuhn-Fricker wrote in an email to the principal of her daughter\u2019s school five days before she was killed. \u201cHe made these choices. He is spreading hate.\u201d\n\nSlain mother worried her daughter\u2019s boyfriend was neo-Nazi\n\nGiampa\u2019s attorneys did not offer a defense in court and declined to comment after the hearing. Members of Giampa\u2019s family said in interviews with The Washington Post last year that they did not believe he was a racist, that instead he posted the tweets to get a rise out of people online. They said he suffered from autism and depression and had few friends. They said he told them Kuhn-Fricker\u2019s daughter had issues with her family and said they believe the killing stemmed from those issues, not from any white-supremacist beliefs.\n\n\u201cI wish it would have been us, not them,\u201d Giampa\u2019s mother previously said of the Frickers. \u201cThey truly didn\u2019t deserve it. It comes back on me.\u201d\n\nFairfax County police detective Kevin Reynolds testified Tuesday about arriving on the scene in the early hours of Dec. 22, 2017, as events were still unfolding. Giampa sat nearby in a green jail jumpsuit listening impassively. A long scar snaked across the side of his head and curled behind his ear from surgeries related to his gunshot wound.\n\nReynolds said authorities received a 911 call from the Fricker\u2019s young son, saying both of his parents had been shot.\n\nJanet Kuhn, Kuhn-Fricker\u2019s mother, told The Post in 2017 that detectives told her that her daughter and son-in-law went to check on her granddaughter shortly before 5 a.m. after possibly hearing a sound.\n\nThe parents discovered Giampa in the daughter\u2019s bedroom, Kuhn said detectives told her. Scott Fricker yelled at the boyfriend to get out of the house, but Giampa pulled out a gun and shot both parents, according to the account provided by detectives.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Reynolds testified that Fairfax County police officers made their way into the home soon after. The officers heard screaming from the upper floor and took to the stairs, Reynolds testified. Buckley Kuhn-Fricker was lying at the top, suffering from a gunshot wound. She appeared dead.\n\nReynolds told the courtroom he heard a gunshot coming from a room with a closed door. The Frickers\u2019 daughter soon exited, saying, \u201cHe shot himself,\u201d Reynolds testified.\n\nReynolds said he entered the room and found Giampa writhing on the floor. \u201cIt looked like he had a gunshot wound to the forehead,\u201d Reynolds testified.\n\nScott Fricker was found suffering from a gunshot wound in another room. Both Frickers were pronounced dead at the scene. Giampa was taken to a hospital and underwent months of treatment and surgeries.\n\nHer son, facing murder charges, is being called an \u2018alt-right killer.\u2019 She blames herself.\n\nJanet Kuhn has said the events were set in motion earlier that week. Kuhn-Fricker, who owned an elder-care business and had a law degree, sent the email to the principal at the Dominion School laying out her concerns about Giampa on the Sunday before the killings.\n\nKuhn-Fricker discovered Giampa\u2019s Twitter account, which has since been deleted, while looking at her daughter\u2019s phone. The account featured tweets praising Adolf Hitler, supporting Nazi book burnings, calling for \u201cwhite revolution,\u201d making derogatory comments about Jews and featuring an illustration of a man hanging from a noose beneath a slur for gay people. The tweets also featured Atomwaffen, a white-nationalist group whose members have been tied to a handful of killings.\n\nKuhn-Fricker wrote in the email to the principal that their daughter told her over the previous summer that the boyfriend was very good at history and that her daughter asked, \u201cDid you know that Jews are partly to blame for World War II?\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday of that week, Kuhn-Fricker spent the day pleading with her daughter to stop seeing Giampa because of his views and the relationship was broken off, friends and family said. By Thursday, the mother texted a friend saying the \u201coutspoken Neo Nazi\u201d was out of their lives.\n\nGiampa\u2019s family said the news sent him into a tailspin. He grew increasingly agitated and inconsolable. The teen wrote in a therapy workbook: \u201cI\u2019ve given up on trying to be happy. Everything I care about leaves or is taken away.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, police said, he opened fire on the Frickers.\n\nOne accused teacher, 8,000 lewd images: A school\u2019s exploitation shows no place is safe from hidden cameras anymore\n\nHe had \u2018goals and a vision.\u2019 Jamel Kirkland is D.C.\u2019s eighth victim age 11 to 17 to be fatally shot this year.\n\nHe was found insane in one killing. D.C. police say this man killed again.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The victims had forced a breakup over concern about Nicholas Giampa\u2019s neo-Nazi views, the family said.", "authors": ["Justin Jouvenal", "Reporter Covering Courts", "Policing"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SR_HrYpNrsN56Rtt6ttyMaNv8DQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YRZC6YX7YEI6PHJR24WPPDN65Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
