His novels are peppered with motels, carpeting, dorm rooms, and the color beige\u2013all seasoned with regular volleys of profanity.\n\nBut don\u2019t take our word for it. To determine Franzen\u2019s 50 favorite words, TIME Labs compared the frequency of each word in Franzen\u2019s five novels to their frequency across all English language novels, using data that Google provides. (The exciting methodology is at the bottom.)\n\nRANK WORD USES NOVELS PER FRANZEN NOVEL PER ALL NOVELS 1 f\u2013k 147 5 29.4 2.3 2 so-called 20 5 4.0 0.00015 3 french 68 5 13.6 0.23 4 f\u2013king 111 5 22.2 2.5 5 long-term 13 4 3.3 0.00013 6 d\u2013k 54 5 10.8 0.63 7 s\u2013t 118 5 23.6 3.8 8 f\u2013ked 45 4 11.3 0.67 9 a\u2013hole 42 5 8.4 0.53 10 tad 39 3 13.0 0.26 11 carpeting 38 4 9.5 0.27 12 bulls\u2013t 46 4 11.5 0.65 13 underpants 28 5 5.6 0.17 14 marxist 14 5 2.8 0.023 15 boyfriend 110 5 22.0 2.4 16 merger 65 4 16.3 3 17 sofa 132 5 26.4 2.8 18 motel 43 5 8.6 0.94 19 whoa 19 3 6.3 0.077 20 knapsack 27 3 9.0 0.31 21 dorm 32 5 6.4 0.56 22 midwestern 23 4 5.8 0.2 23 goddamned 19 4 4.8 0.2 24 pajamas 35 5 7.0 0.49 25 cruiser 28 4 7.0 0.8 26 stadium 42 3 14.0 1.3 27 blah 21 5 4.2 0.38 28 niceness 15 5 3.0 0.061 29 nightstand 23 5 4.6 0.26 30 grownup 17 4 4.3 0.08 31 carton 28 4 7.0 0.48 32 driveway 59 5 11.8 1.8 33 daddy 43 4 10.8 1.3 34 dude 25 5 5.0 0.57 35 wow 27 4 6.8 0.34 36 wolf 93 4 23.3 2.7 37 bunny 20 3 6.7 0.25 38 beige 28 5 5.6 0.44 39 Coke 24 5 4.8 0.84 40 girlfriend 95 4 23.8 2.6 41 dialed 27 5 5.4 0.67 42 smelled 81 5 16.2 1.9 43 raincoat 18 4 4.5 0.21 44 martini 16 3 5.3 0.24 45 gonna 50 5 10.0 3.7 46 cartons 20 5 4.0 0.31 47 bedspread 16 4 4.0 0.16 48 two-dimensional 4 3 1.3 0.0001 49 turds 10 3 3.3 0.035 50 jeans 74 5 14.8 2.7\n\nMethodology\n\nWords are ranked by a score known as \u201cterm frequency-inverse document frequency,\u201d a well-established method of determining which words in a text are particularly important.\n\nOur algorithm considered only lowercase words that appear in at least three of Franzen\u2019s five novels. The only alteration to the original texts that TIME made was to convert uppercase words at the beginning of sentences to lowercase if they appeared elsewhere in the novels as a lowercase word. (This method, while imperfect, tends to sort out proper nouns while not undercounting words that commonly start sentences.)\n\nFor a baseline comparison, we used Google\u2019s English Fiction files, using the 2007 levels of each word that Franzen uses.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://timeinclabs.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/franzen-fucking.png"}
