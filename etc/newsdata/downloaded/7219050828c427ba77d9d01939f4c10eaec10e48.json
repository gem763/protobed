'\n\nThe Sound Shirt is connected to a computer system that picks up the audio from microphones placed at various points around the orchestra's stage\n\nThe deeper, heavier bass notes [activate the actuators] down in lower parts of torso, and the lighter sections, like violin and lighter notes, further up on the body, around the neck area and clavicle\n\n'As they're watching the orchestra, they can see certain areas are more active than others; they feel soundwaves in specific areas of the body, and within a few minutes understand there is a correlation.'\n\nThe shirt was also designed to feel comfortable against the skin, as there are no wires and was developed with 'soft stretch fabrics'.\n\nFrancesca Rosella, co-founder and chief creative officer of CuteCircuit, told Reuters 'inside the shirt \u2014 that, by the way, is completely textiles, there are no wires inside, so we're only using smart fabrics \u2014 we have a combination of microelectronics \u2026 very thin and flexible and conductive fabrics.'\n\nAnd it has proven successful in the real world for twin who love to dance, but both lost their hearing at a young age -- and the firm has contracted them to model the high-tech shorts.\n\nSound Shirts don't come cheap, as they are expected to go on sale at more than $3,675\n\n'It's almost like feeling the depth of the music,' Hermon Berhane told Reuters. 'It just feels as though we can move along with it.'\n\nSound Shirts don't come cheap, as they are expected to go on sale at more than $3,673, but Heroda believes it's a price worth paying for deaf people who enjoy music as much as she and her sister do.\n\n'I think it could definitely change our lives,' Hermon Berhane said.", "description": "A firm that has supplied Katy Perry with outfits for concerts has revealed a high-tech garment for deaf individuals that transforms music into vibrations so the wearer can feel the sound.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/18/19503266-0-image-a-7_1570642633751.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
