Photo: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s campaign would like you to know that Elizabeth Warren has been to a \u201cswanky\u201d fundraiser or two in her day.\n\nIn an op-ed for the Washington Post, Ed Rendell, former Pennsylvania governor and current Biden supporter, declares the senator\u2019s avowed opposition to \u201cbig money fundraisers\u201d hypocritical: Although Warren has refrained from shaking down the Martha\u2019s Vineyard set during her presidential run, she welcomed their sponsorship during her Senate reelection fight in 2018. Not only that, she\u2019s still actively benefiting from those bleeding-heart billionaires\u2019 largesse, having transferred $10.4 million in leftover funds from her reelection bid to the coffers of her 2020 campaign.\n\nRendell\u2019s argument is both ostensibly accurate and largely pointless. Warren is still devoting a far higher share of her campaign to courting ordinary voters than Biden is, due to the latter\u2019s greater dependence on the kindness of bundlers. And if Warren wins the nomination, she will still owe far less to her party\u2019s well-heeled wing than a victorious Biden would. Her attacks on the Democratic front-runner for holding the kinds of fundraising events that she once frequented may be a tad hypocritical. But Uncle Joe is not exactly a principled opponent of hyperbole and detail-fudging in campaign oratory. And Warren\u2019s willingness to redistribute a little wealth from plutocrats to her campaign staff ultimately tells us very little about who she is as a candidate, or would be as a president.\n\nBig money is corrosive force in our politics. But it is not the case that every wealthy Democratic donor is trying to push the party right, or that every politician who takes cash from the rich becomes beholden to their whims. The left needs its class traitors. Bernie Sanders has benefited from the patronage of high-dollar Democratic donors at various points in his career. A $100,000 gift from a Silicon Valley millionaire helped get the socialist magazine Jacobin off the ground. Das Kapital was, in a sense, corporate sponsored.\n\nThus, the millions that Warren\u2019s campaigns have accepted from the rich is much less telling than the billions her policies have taken from them: Warren\u2019s indefatigable efforts brought the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau into being \u2014 and the CFPB has transferred more than $12 billion from predatory financial companies to exploited consumers. Biden, meanwhile, championed legislation that transferred wealth from indebted consumers to credit-card companies.\n\nThat distinction counts for more than the two candidates\u2019 mutual history of attending galas. Or so reactionary business-channel talking heads seem to believe. Earlier this week, a panel of Wall Streeters convened by CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer provided the Massachusetts senator with an accidental endorsement.\n\nI'm Elizabeth Warren and I approve this message. https://t.co/2Ewkbm0ZwA \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 10, 2019\n\nAnd on Wednesday night, Fox Business Channel\u2019s Stuart Varney provided Warren with an even more flattering denunciation. Varney warned his viewers that Warren\u2019s wealth tax \u201cwould have cut the net worth of the 15 richest Americans in half!\u201d As if that weren\u2019t horrifying enough to the typical member of America\u2019s declining middle class, Varney continued, \u201cWarren would force all big companies to take a lot of their profit away from shareholders. And it would be given to the workforce, the community, customers, the local and global environment, and community and societal factors (whatever that is).\u201d\n\nStuart Varney: \"Sen. Warren would force all big companies to take a lot of their profit away from shareholders.

Thus, when Varney says that Warren would shift profits from shareholders to workers and customers, he is promising that she would take from the few to give to the many. Which does not seem like an optimal attack line in a polity where property ownership is not a prerequisite for suffrage, or at least, not in one where the one percent has been commandeering the gains of growth for nearly a half century.\n\nI suppose one could read Cramer and Varney\u2019s flattering attacks on the Warren candidacy as covert endorsements. Perhaps they believe that Warren\u2019s history of attending ritzy fundraisers tells us more about how she\u2019d regulate the financial industry than her history of confiscating large sums of wealth from predatory financiers. But I wouldn\u2019t put \u201cmad\u201d money on it.", "description": "As Team Biden questions the authenticity of Warren\u2019s populism, conservative financial journalist Stuart Varney unintentionally rallies to her defense, saying that Warren\u2019s wealth tax would \u201ccut the net worth of the 15 richest Americans in half!\u201d", "authors": ["Eric Levitz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/12/12-elizabeth-warren.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
