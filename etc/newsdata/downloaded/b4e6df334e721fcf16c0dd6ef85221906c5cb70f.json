HD, +0.26% and Lowe\u2019s Cos. LOW, -0.35% typically enjoy an initial sales boost during severe weather and natural disasters, as shoppers rush to stock up on batteries, flashlights and generators ahead of the event. They are later a destination for people whose homes and properties are damaged as they flock to buy lumber and flooring for repairs.\n\nBut both retail chains also have a large number of stores in Florida that may flood and be forced to close, according to Jefferies. Home Depot has 153 stores in the Sunshine State, equal to 8% of its overall U.S. network, while Lowe\u2019s has 126 stores, equal to 7% of its U.S. network, analysts led by Jonathan Matuszewski wrote in a note to clients. Smaller rival Floor & Decor Holdings Inc. FND, +1.93% has 18 stores, accounting for 18% of its network.\n\n\u201cWhile not all stores are in communities expected to be impacted, each retailer has clear exposure,\u201d the analysts wrote Friday.\n\nHurricane Matthew in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 led to an initial sales lift of $100 million for Home Depot, said the note, while Lowe\u2019s cited a 60 basis-point lift from weather. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, Hurricanes Irma, Nate and Harvey generated a $282 million sales lift for Home Depot and a 140 basis-point comp lift for Lowe\u2019s.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: As Florida braces for Hurricane Dorian, here\u2019s what you should pack in your \u2018financial go-bag\u2019\n\nStill, \u201csimilar to past significant weather events, storm-related expenses will be incurred,\u2019 said the note. \u201cRecall, Home Depot reported costs of $167 million to drive $650 million in hurricane-sales during the second half of fiscal 2018, encapsulating the months Irma/Nate/Harvey hit and the next quarter,\u201d said the note. \u201cSome degree of gross margin deterioration for home improvement centers is likely given the profitability profiles of in-demand SKUs (shopkeeping units) like plywood and generators.\u201d\n\nSee also: Here\u2019s the science behind hurricane forecasts and calls to evacuate\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear yet if store closures will happen, but they have occurred in the past under conditions created by the storms named Michael, Irma and Harvey, said the note.\n\nWells Fargo estimates the benefit for the home-improvement sector at about 10 to 50 basis points, but identifies another type of retailer as a more likely beneficiary.\n\n\u201cWe believe benefits to Auto Parts retailers are more likely to accrue post-storm as consumers repair damaged vehicles, and in the event of vehicle replacement, Carvana CVNA, -1.58% would be a potential beneficiary (with markets in Miami, Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa,\u201d wrote analysts led by Zachary Fadem.\n\nCarvana lists and sells its cars online. Customers browse the offerings and then can have the car delivered or pick up the car from Carvana\u2019s multistory, coin-operated vending machines. The company, which went public in April of 2017, posted sales of $986 million for the second quarter on Aug. 7, up from $475 million in the year-earlier period.\n\nWells Fargo is forecasting benefits for Home Depot and Floor & Lighting of about 50 basis points, and expects Lowe\u2019s to enjoy a 40 basis point benefit. Analysts expect Advance Auto Parts Inc. AAP, -0.09%, AutoZone Inc. AZO, -1.08% and O\u2019Reilly Automotive Inc. ORLY, -0.44% to enjoy benefits of 10 to 20 basis points.\n\nRead now: Lowe\u2019s gears up for growth as Home Depot slows down, analysts say\n\n\u201cThe impact for Floor & Lighting will largely depend on the amount of water damage to homes, noting Hurricane Harvey provided an +800 basis point comp lift in the fourth quarter of 2017 (on 100%+ growth in Houston), while Hurricane Irma had limited impact (and was actually -120 basis points from store closures),\u201d said the analysts.\n\nThe sales boost may not lead to a big increase in profit, they cautioned. Hurricane-related sales often include items that carry lower margins. And retailers may incur costs from disruption to transportation and distribution centers if they are impacted by the storm.\n\nSee: Home Depot will feel the impact of lumber price deflation and Lowe\u2019s improvement\n\n\u201cHigher hurricane sales may not drive increased EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) dollars, as the incremental margins could be offset by the additional expenses,\u201d said Fadem.\n\nYet another group of retailers, those that are based or have many stores in Florida but do not sell storm-related items, are expected to be hurt if the storm causes widespread damage, said the analyst. That list includes National Vision Holdings Inc. EYE, -1.63%, with 12% of its stores based in Florida; arts and crafts retailer Michael Cos. Inc. MIK, -1.05% with 7% of its stores in the state; Bed Bath and Beyond Inc. BBBY, +2.00%, which has 6% of its stores in Florida; and Best Buy Co. Inc. BBY, +0.25% with 5% of its network in the state.\n\nSee: Target will take a bite out of its grocery competition with Good & Gather, experts say\n\nHome Depot shares were up 0.1% Friday, Lowe\u2019s was down 0.4% and Floor & Decor was up 1.3%.\n\nCarvana was down 1.4%, National Vision was down 2.6%, Advance Auto was flat, AutoZone was down 1.1% and O\u2019Reilly was down 0.5%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.16% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.06% were flat.\n\nRead now: What really helped Walmart clean up with earnings \u2014 robot \u2018associates\u2019", "description": "Shares of home-improvement retailers were mixed Friday, as analysts said they stand to both benefit from and potentially get hurt by Hurricane Dorian, which...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ504_Hurric_ZG_20190830141005.jpg"}
