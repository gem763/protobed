I just didn't have the energy to be negative.\"\n\nInstead, her focus has been on her family, especially her son, 3-year-old Jaxen. He's autistic and he's non-verbal but a few days before his third birthday is when he was diagnosed with neuroblastoma stage four cancer.\n\nRagland says Jaxen has been hospitalized over 20 times and has had seven surgeries. She wanted people to know, so she shared his story, and the note, on Facebook.\n\n\"My whole point was to show people you don't know what somebody's going through. Kindness goes such a long way. Gratitude goes such a long way,\" Ragland said.\n\nAs word spread, an army of strangers mobilized to help. A local lawn care service came to cut her grass and dozens of volunteers tackled everything from picking up supplies for the family to clearing away brush in her yard.\n\nJoey Harding who helped with volunteer efforts, understands the family's struggle. Just weeks ago, his daughter Lulu died. She was 6 and had the same kind of cancer as Jaxen.\n\n\"Words can't describe what this means to me right now. It's helping me,\" Harding explained. \"It's helping me cope with losing my daughter. To help another family in need.\"\n\nThe group now calls itself Jaxen's \"Army For Justice\" and its mission has rallied strangers from all over the world.\n\n\"I'm in amazement. I'm still in shock,\" Ragland said. \"I don't have a large family. My mom is gone, my dad is gone, my brother is gone so this means a lot.\"", "description": "\"My whole point was to show people you don't know what somebody's going through.
