Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is making her first endorsement of a liberal challenger to an incumbent House Democrat, backing Marie Newman in the primary against eight-term Rep. Daniel Lipinski in Illinois.\n\nThe New York congresswoman for now is putting her name and small-dollar fundraising ability behind congressional candidates, rather than in the presidential primary.\n\nLipinski, who opposes abortion rights, is among the more conservative Democrats in the House and defeated Newman in a primary last cycle.\n\nMarie Newman, candidate for Congress in IL-03, speaks during event to receive the endorsement of Reps. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., and Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., in Washington on Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2018. Rep.

Ed Markey, who faces a potential primary challenge from Rep. Joe Kennedy III. Markey is a co-sponsor of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019 \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d proposal.\n\nJustice Democrats, a group aligned with Ocasio-Cortez that has backed Newman and several other challengers to incumbent lawmakers in the House, announced the endorsement Tuesday.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Rep.
