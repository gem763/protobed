He did not elaborate.\n\nThe U.S. State Department previously insisted the discussions went \"good,\" and pushed back against North Korea's accusation that U.S. negotiators failed to bring any new ideas to the talks.\n\nNorth Korea has since threatened to resume long-range ballistic missile or nuclear tests and reiterated its end-of-year deadline for the U.S. to take a more flexible approach.", "description": "U.S. Ambassador: N.Korea Asked for 'Everything' While Offering Nothing", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/15/2019101500543_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
