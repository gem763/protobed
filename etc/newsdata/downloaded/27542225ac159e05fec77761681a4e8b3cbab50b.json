REUTERS/Michele Tantussi\n\nThe source said Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives and her Social Democrat partners agreed a carbon price for energy used in buildings and transport in line with the existing European Union emissions trading scheme, in which certificates traded at 26.30/tonne on Friday.\n\nThat price, lower than the 40 euro price many climate economists had been advocating, means pressure on German companies to cut emissions will be lower than many expected.\n\nBut the source added that the scheme, details of which are set to be announced by Merkel later on Friday, will contain provisions allowing the government to take corrective measures if targets on emissions cuts risk being missed.\n\nAnother source said the package would have a volume of 50 billion euros (\u00a344.14 billion) through to 2023 and would be financed without new debt.\n\nThe deal, billed as one setting the direction of Europe\u2019s largest economy over the coming decades, was being finalised as protesters massed at thousands of locations around the world to demand swifter action to curb climate change.\n\nSeveral thousand protesters, inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg\u2019s Fridays for Future movement, rallied at Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg Gate as the negotiations were underway.\n\nThe outcome appears to be a compromise between the conservatives\u2019 desire for an emissions trading scheme that supports innovation in Germany\u2019s corporations and the SPD\u2019s desire for a carbon tax which would support those hardest hit by the costs of the transition away from carbon.\n\nRelated Coverage Germany to raise incentives for buying electric cars - climate policy document\n\nThe plan also includes measures to help households pay for the transition away from the use of polluting heating oil that remains common in much of western Germany.\n\n\u201cThere are difficult decisions to be taken,\u201d Lars Klingbeil, secretary general of the Social Democrats (SPD) told public radio earlier when asked why talks were so lengthy. \u201cThe challenges are huge - exiting coal power, building out renewable energy, cutting carbon dioxide emissions.\u201d\n\nA poll for public television has shown 63 percent of Germans thought protecting the climate was more important than economic growth.", "description": "Germany's governing parties on Friday agreed a new climate protection package, including a domestic carbon price and the possibility of more stringent measures in future, a source close to the talks said.", "authors": ["Holger Hansen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431921404&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0MU", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
