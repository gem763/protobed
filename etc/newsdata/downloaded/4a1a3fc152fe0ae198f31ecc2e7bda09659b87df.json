One of his arrests led to a toxicology exam that found marijuana and Xanax in his system. In February\u2019s Vogue he said he\u2019d once been dependent on Xanax but that he\u2019s been off of it since 2014. This new post refers to \u201cpretty heavy drugs\u201d that he\u2019s quit, a vague description that\u2019s generated a lot of publicity. But really his Instagram caption is notable for other reasons.\n\nIn drawing on the history of difficult child stardom, Bieber points at the ways such stardom has changed. Young celebrities have struggled with substance abuse and mental health in the public spotlight for as long as Hollywood has existed, yet the internet has shifted how those sagas are received by audiences and managed by the stars. The rites of the child star\u2019s career always have a certain inevitability to them: There\u2019s the exciting prodigy phase, the Grown and Sexy transition, and so on. There\u2019s also the expectation that fame will batter the star, with his or her scrubbed-clean image, at some point, cracking spectacularly.\n\nMore and more, though, the messiness of growing up in the spotlight has been alchemized into part of the official celebrity narrative: something to be acknowledged and worked through in public rather than hidden and denied until the tell-all book years later. Facing PTSD, a high-profile breakup, and the death of an ex, Ariana Grande hit the recording studio and emerged with a dark and defiant album. Demi Lovato, caught in a years-long cycle of drug addiction and recovery, has released not only inspirational documentaries about rehab, but also one eerily timely single about relapse. Next week, a slate of musicians including young voices like Shawn Mendes and Fifth Harmony\u2019s Lauren Jauregui will be featured in a radio documentary about mental health\u2014one of many recent pop products addressing the matter.\n\nBieber\u2019s note emphasizes two seemingly contradictory notions: that his struggles have been extraordinary, and that they\u2019ve been relatable. He talks about transforming from an anonymous 13-year-old into someone praised worldwide, and then into someone despised worldwide\u2014all of which makes for a particularly extreme version of the child-star narrative that most people already understand as perilous. Yet his note is also peppered with direct appeals to the reader: \u201cI can fully sympathize with you,\u201d \u201cthings all of us have to go through,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know about you but humility comes with age.\u201d Even the note\u2019s glitchy spelling and grammar builds on the let\u2019s-just-level disclaimer he put on a message earlier this year about taking a break from music: \u201cgrammar and punctuation will be terrible pretend it\u2019s a text where u just don\u2019t care.\u201d", "description": "The onetime child star is telling himself that he\u2019s not alone in his struggles\u2014and that his fans aren\u2019t either.", "authors": ["Spencer Kornhaber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTSQFR8/facebook.jpg?1567628876", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
