She is the founder of personal finance website Hermoney.com, as well as the podcast of the same name. Her site offers loan calculators and budget spreadsheets to help anybody get better with their finances.\n\nMany people need to improve their financial situations \u2014 and some know it. So many Americans are working without having a proper retirement account through their employer, at times because of the company\u2019s lack of this benefit and other times because they can\u2019t afford it or don\u2019t know about the plans. There are ways to turn this negative into a positive, though, Chatzky said, and that includes learning about the various investing tools available and a new perspective on saving.\n\nSee: Maria Bartiromo talks artificial intelligence, the dot-com crash and why she\u2019ll never retire\n\nChatzky spoke with MarketWatch about what Americans can do to save for retirement and what people in general are getting wrong about various strategies to get there.\n\nMarketWatch: How would you describe the current state of affairs for retirement?\n\nJean Chatzky: If you look at the research \u2014 and I look at a lot of research \u2014 there\u2019s a consensus that Americans are not saving enough. The 401(k) plans and other defined contribution plans have taken the place of the most important vehicle and as we head toward retirement, many people are just not putting as much as they should be in those accounts every year. The end result is interesting when you look at how it\u2019s turning out when people hit retirement. Average earners, who earn $50,000 to $60,000 a year, they aren\u2019t doing so badly because many of their expenses won\u2019t grow in retirement. It\u2019s the high earner \u2014 the people who are not considered wealthy but who earn more than the average person \u2014 who has not saved enough to cover their expenses in retirement.\n\nThe retirement landscape has evolved. We have more opportunities to save. It\u2019s not just 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts. We have seen work and state programs emerge, like in Illinois and Oregon, that help people who work for smaller employers make contributions. That\u2019s really, really important. And we have seen the emergence of Health Savings Accounts for people to grow money tax-free and to use as a supplemental account for retirement.\n\nMW: How can younger people be encouraged or persuaded to save more for retirement?\n\nChatzky: I think employers do a nice job with the incentives that are offered. I am encouraged by the student loan benefits that I\u2019m seeing some employers roll out for what is no doubt a really difficult burden for a lot of people. But I also think that when you\u2019re looking at a huge amount of debt and student loan balances they\u2019re carrying, sometimes we feel we absolutely have to deal with that before we can deal with anything else.\n\nInstead, I think we should try to reduce our interest rates on student loan debt as much as possible and compartmentalize and pay them off on a 10-year schedule (or longer sometimes for people who get income-based repayments). Then use the excess capacity that provides you to save and invest for other goals and do things like 401(k) contributions that get matched and putting money in an HSA.\n\nRead: WeWork is beginning to offer its employees a 401(k) match \u2014 but don\u2019t ask if it\u2019s a good one\n\nMW: What about for those who haven\u2019t saved enough but are closer to retirement? What can they do?\n\nChatzky: Many people underestimate that working an extra six months or a year or two can have a really dramatic impact on your fortunes because it allows the money in your retirement plans to continue to grow, allows you to continue to make contributions to those plans, and means that you can start withdrawing later, which is a benefit. It means you can put off taking Social Security, and the combined impact is really great. We see people continue to work into retirement, either part-time or full-time, in a profession they feel more favorable toward.\n\nMW: Is there one big obstacle keeping people from saving enough for retirement?\n\nChatzky: Underearning prevents people from saving, but so does student debt, consumer debt, medical debt, adult children who are remaining on the payroll longer than expected, older parents who need help, too. There are so many different people under so many different financial stresses.\n\nMW: What about mental obstacles? Do you think some of it could be psychological?\n\nChatzky: People know they should be saving. It is very clear to people that if you want to turn your financial life around, you should spend less. I also think that people who want to lose weight know they should eat less and exercise more and yet both of these things are very hard to do and they\u2019re difficult because we are human, and humans are wired to prefer immediate gratification to delayed gratification. It is biological, and although it seems old school but people should go through the exercise of tracking spending to see where your money is going. I\u2019ve done this helping people get their financial lives in order and it is always eye-opening, and it makes you feel more powerful and more in control of your money. For anyone who wants to increase the amount they\u2019re saving, it is a worthwhile exercise.\n\nThen to capture the good work and make it sustainable, it is really important to automate savings. You can\u2019t expect people to go into their checking accounts and every single month do the work of transferring money.\n\nAlso see: Behavioral finance experts say these 5 things can make you richer in your old age\n\nMW: Is there any one common piece of advice you think is exaggerated or perhaps not very helpful?\n\nChatzky: The emphasis on lattes is exaggerated. I wrote a column for HerMoney.com called \u201cNewsflash: The f***-ing latte is a f***-ing metaphor.\u201d The most important thing you can do when it comes to spending is to be conscious of where your money is going. Money is a limited resource for all of us and that means making choices of where we\u2019re spending it. And if it\u2019s coffee or Uber that is high on your list of things that makes your life better, I\u2019m not going to tell you not to buy that because you\u2019re not going to listen to me but secondly, because that\u2019s not the point. The point is that you should figure out what choices you want to make that will be most beneficial to you.\n\nMW: Some people do subscribe to that type of advice, especially when they\u2019re trying to be especially frugal to retire early in the FIRE movement (short for \u201cFinancial Independence, Retire Early\u201d). Do you think could be the next wave of retirement?\n\nChatzky: There\u2019s a lot to learn from the FI in FIRE \u2014 the and there are proponents of the FIRE movement who have been able to really increase their savings rate. If you pay attention, they save 30% to 50% or more of the money they\u2019re earning, and that buys a lot of freedom in the years to come.\n\nBut the other thing to understand, and I\u2019ve interviewed people who blog and have podcasts and talk about this a lot \u2014 they\u2019re still earning money while they are \u201cindependent.\u201d The bloggers are blogging, the podcasters are podcasting and a lot of people are speaking. And even people not in the media and not preaching about FIRE \u2014 many of them have found their ways into work that they find more important to them. I think if you\u2019re not going to have another income from the time you\u2019re 40 years old\u2026 if that is the picture you\u2019re getting from the movement, then you\u2019re getting the wrong picture.", "description": "We all know we need to save for the future, but immediate gratification is more appealing", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR847_JeanCh_MG_20190923102248.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
