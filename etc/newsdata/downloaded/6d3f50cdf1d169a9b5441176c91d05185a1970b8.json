A high-end accessories brand has launched 14k gold vampire grills, with the rather startling price tag of $10,000.\n\nMiansai, a jewelry brand which has found fans in the likes of Sofia Richie and Kate Hudson, revealed their new limited-edition fang-shaped mouth piece just in time for Halloween.\n\nThe extravagant one-size-fits-all grills will be made to order and take two weeks to complete.\n\nFangs: Jewelry brand Miansai are selling limited edition 14k gold vampire grills for a whopping $10,000\n\nClassic: Vampire teeth - always a fail safe Halloween costume - can be found for as little as $0.39c, but you likely won't be tossing the solid gold version after one use\n\nIn terms of shape, the solid gold set look like a dead-ringer to the average party store find - albeit they're likely far heavier than any flimsy $1 plastic version.\n\nGrills are somewhat rising in popularity among celebrities. Miley Cyrus recently told Harper's Bazaar she has three 'chic' gold teeth, and Katy Perry, Madonna and Beyonce have previously been photographed flaunting their 'grillz'.\n\nSpeaking of grills, this isn't Miami-based Miansai's first unusual offering either.\n\nCookout fans can snap up a 14k solid gold four-piece 'Grill Set' including a spatula, fork, knife and tongs. If they have a spare $65,000 that is.\n\nAnd on the subject of being extravagant, last year Miansai began selling 18k gold Juul cases which retailed for $5,000 a pop.\n\nHungry? Miansai offer a BBQ cookout 'Grill Set' at a staggering $65,000\n\nBuyers also have the option to add a personal monogram to the case, which, like the vampire grills, are all made to order.\n\nBut for $5,000 - or $1,000 for the sterling silver option - you still have to buy your own Juul device to include inside.\n\nMiansai (pronounced my-ahn-sigh) is named after founder Michael Andrew Saiger, who launched the brand from his college dorm room back in 2008.\n\nWhile Miansai began as a men's jewelry offering, it adapted to a more unisex offering when Saiger met his now-wife Rachael Russell, who serves as the fashion director.\n\nJuul-ery: Last October, the brand launched a solid 18K gold e-cigarette case\n\nIt'll cost ya... The solid gold version of the Juul case (left) is priced at $5,000, while the sterling silver option (right) retails for $1,000\n\nFounder: Micheal Saiger of Miansai jewelry\n\nWith stores in the coolest retail areas of the U.S. such as Miami's Wynwood District, Venice Beach in California and New York's SoHo neighborhood, the brand continues to appeal to style-conscious men and women.\n\n'We design simple and minimalist jewelry, the type of pieces that you can wear any time, any where,' Saiger recently told Femail.\n\n'I started designing men\u2019s jewelry because I kept searching for the perfect bracelet for myself and wasn\u2019t finding anything.\n\n'I like my jewelry to be the kind of thing you don\u2019t want to take off; something that's easy to wear and an essential part of your everyday lifestyle.\n\n'My goal is for you to still be wearing our jewelry 20 years from now because the designs are timeless,' he added.", "description": "A high-end jewelry brand is offering sets of 14k gold vampire grills for $10,000, just in time for Halloween.
