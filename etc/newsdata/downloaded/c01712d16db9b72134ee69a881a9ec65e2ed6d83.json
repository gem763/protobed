The plant also benefited from a building extension and new robotic welding machines to ensure production efficiency.\n\n\"The local value addition of the Hiace Ses\u2019fikile has increased from 38% to 44%. This localisation has added R422 million per annum local value addition to the economy,\" Kirby says.\n\nIn seven years, Toyota has gone from importing a complete built-up unit (CBU) to a complete knock-down (CKD). \"Since the introduction of the local manufacture of this product we have seen the volumes increase from 9300 units to 14 000 units per year, which equated to an increase of 37%,\" Kirby announced.\n\nThe local minibus taxi industry is worth around R50-billion a year, according to a Business Insider. Minibus taxis represent 75% of all transport to work, school and university, illustrating how important a driver (pardon the pun) it is to the local economy.\n\nToyota says the Hiace controls 96.1% of the market share, an increase from 77% in 2015.\n\nMinister of Trade, Industry and Competition, Ebrahim Patel lauded the investment into Kwa-Zulu Natal and even challenged KZN MEC of economic development Nomusa Dube-Ncube to change the car provided to her by the government to a Toyota produced at the Prospecton plant.\n\n\"Since TSAM\u2019s localisation programme began, more than 80 000 taxis have been assembled locally by Toyota. If each of those taxis opened its doors to commuters right now, more than a million South Africans would be able to climb in. The increased level of local content is an important part of the 2035 vision for the industry and will increase the participation of more South Africans in this thriving sector of the economy,\u201d says Patel.\n\nKirby also announced that TSAM will begin its export operations to support the local assembly of Hilux in Kenya at the end of October.\n\nClose to R20-million has been invested to establish a packing plant to support a knock-down business which 20 additional jobs created. Kenyan customers will benefit by being able to buy their vehicles at a more competitive price.\n\nCompiled by Sean Parker", "description": "The assembly plant of South Africa's most popular minibus taxi, the Toyota Hiace Ses'fikile, received a R454-million investment with a focus on increasing locally-manufactured parts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7884/e5489bd7de1d441bb8e7ca9746c6ad63.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
