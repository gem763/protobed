Some of the guys say 'I want to see you doing this', but it's important they build a relationship or a friendship with you first,\" she said.\n\n\"You have to be willing to talk about anything and at the same token, if you are uncomfortable you can just log yourself off and go and take five minutes.\n\n\"I'm never ever uncomfortable there but they're paying so you have to treat it like it's customer service.\"\n\nZoe described the strangers who call her up as \"brave men\", and said she finds the attention flattering.\n\n\"The way I see it, if you're at home or you're doing something in your day and you want to speak to a complete stranger that you like the look of, I think that's a really brave thing to do, so I actually admire it.\n\n\"It's really flattering that someone would speak to me so I like to delve into why they've called. One guy honestly calls me for an hour to talk about my cat.\n\n\"He knows I love my cat and he likes to know how he is. They like to make friends out of you as well.\"\n\nZoe said the night shifts, which start form 10pm, are a lot more sexually motivated as girls are permitted to show a lot more. However, she opts for day hours only.\n\n\"The whole nature of it is that you tease,\" she said.\n\n\"I thought if I'm online or on telly getting nude, where does that end?\n\n\"People have already seen it so for me I don't show a lot. I don't get nude or naked and I keep it that way, because I am quite a private person anyway.\"\n\nZoe works two to three 2-10pm shifts a week to make a living, but although she is looking for love she says she earns so much men can be intimidated by her.\n\n\"I'm just in my 20's having fun, getting to know myself and making sure that I am the best version of myself, and I think I'm on the right track to [meet someone], so fingers crossed.\"\n\nAsked if the sexual nature of her works puts off potential dates, she said the problem was more \"the earnings\".\n\n\"It's been more questions about the income and 'what do you earn? How come you only work two, three times a week? Get a real job' - that kind of thing.\n\n\"It's more been a threat because they don't understand how a woman can earn more than them, and work less.\n\n\"They get a bit envious of it, a bit jealous and a bit unaware of what it entails so kind of try and attack it. I have had it, hence why I'm single and it's not worth the drama at the moment. When you meet the right person they'd understand anyway. \"\n\nZoe wouldn't say how much she gets paid, but revealed customers sometimes offer her cash on top of her wage or gifts including perfume or outfits to wear - purchased from a wish list compiled by each of the girls online.\n\n\"They buy you things, perfume, shoes, outfits you might want to wear. Interaction is on twitter and the website Only Fans. They do call up and ask to buy you things.\n\n\"They offer to [give you money] but I don't like to say yes, because I like to be aware of what I'm earning.\n\n(Image: birminghammail.co.uk/)\n\n\"If someone gave me a lot of money it's a bit unfair on them, but it has been offered but I don't accept it. You make a list online, like an Amazon wish list, and they would buy it off there. That's the way it would be done.\"\n\nZoe said she would stop if she became pregnant, but would potentially return when she has children and \"it's the right time\".\n\n\"I don't really go out. I don't drink, I don't do drugs and so TV and just doing myself up and feeling nice about myself is my escapism, my thing to do for fun,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a bit of an escape and a way to feel nice. In society, you don't feel nice. People are horrible, aren't they? I think if you can go to work and have people call you up and say how nice you look and ask you nice questions about yourself, it actually does a lot for your self-esteem.\"", "description": "Former hairdresser Zoe Smith from Worcester has lifted the lid on life at the sex line, television channel and website", "authors": ["Stephanie Balloo", "Image", "Birminghammail.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728230.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_model-2jpeg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
