His long-running HBO weekly show, \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher,\u201d has become an absolute must-watch for growing numbers of politically minded thinkers of all persuasions looking for a much-needed Friday night laugh.\n\nCase in point: Is there another right, left, or politically neutral comedian in this country who would dare tackle a subject as sensitive as, say, white self guilt, and still manage to be funny AND land on the side of sanity? No joke - that\u2019s exactly what Maher did Friday night when he mocked the \u201ctedious virtue signaling\u201d from \u201cself-loathing\u201d anti-white liberals.\n\n\u201cWhite liberals are the only group that has a bias against themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to hang out only with people who are not them. That\u2019s like your mother preferring the neighbor\u2019s kids. There\u2019s a weird self-loathing going on among white liberals, and it\u2019s not helping anyone. Lifting up those who society has cheated or forsaken, that\u2019s liberalism. Hating all things white is just tedious virtue signaling.\u201d\n\nThe HBO host lampooned the ridiculous white Twitter shame of people like actress Rosanna Arquette, whose August tweet - \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was born white and privileged. It disgusts me. And I feel so much shame\u201d - was summarily deleted after the mockery, including my own, apparently became too much.\n\nThen, Maher went for the double-kill shot, dismantling both the concept of slavery reparations and white liberal self-loathing in one fell swoop: \u201cHow many white liberals would pay actual reparations? Real money, taken out of your paycheck every week. If you really feel this bad about the whole race thing \u2013 if being white is really this toxic for society, let\u2019s tax it. Let\u2019s tax whiteness. A honkey tax.\u201d\n\nNow I don\u2019t care who you are, that\u2019s funny stuff. You\u2019d think being a liberal in the era of peak-PC would make a comedian like Bill Maher tedious, boring and humorless, given that the worst kind of humor - incidentally the only kind allowed these days - is the \u2018safe,\u2019 woke, politically correct, lecturey, kind. The kind that might work to avoid getting deplatformed, non-personed, or blasted by the Twitter \u2018morality police,\u2019 but which sadly isn\u2019t all that great at keeping audiences awake or even mildly interested.\n\nMaher, however, is a notable exception because, far from seeing liberals alone as the epitome of morality and virtue and everyone else as irredeemably evil, his acerbic, politically incorrect brand of political humor is as prone to poking fun at the loonies on his side as at Trump and conservatives. And while most guests include liberals and \u2018conservative\u2019 anti-Trump types, Maher notably has shared his platform with the likes of Ann Coulter, Tomi Lahren, Kellyanne Conway, Rick Santorum and others brave enough to appear and debate with the host and other liberals in front of a hostile crowd. \u201cI love people who stick by their guns, even when the crowd does not agree,\u201d Maher said while discussing the show\u2019s history of inviting conservatives as guests.\n\nAs far as left-leaning politically-incorrect humorists who can laugh at themselves and particularly their own ideologies go, Maher certainly ranks number one, which would actually be an accomplishment if he wasn\u2019t, sadly, the ONLY one. His show is what Saturday Night Live should be, and once was before it became another #Resistance media cog.\n\nFrom mocking political correctness to pointing out the fact that if Donald Trump Jr. had Hunter Biden\u2019s Ukraine connections, Rachel Maddow would be all over it, Maher isn\u2019t afraid to punch left, but always with an eye towards saving it. Though pushing the envelope has always been Maher\u2019s style, he\u2019s not doing it to curry favor with the right. Rather, in his own way, Maher is actually trying to restore some semblance of sanity to what he clearly sees as his own side\u2019s crazies taking over. He wants to win, and he knows his party\u2019s chances with normal Americans decline sharply when seemingly every Democratic candidate must prostrate themselves before the absurd, ever-increasing demands of \u2018wokeness.\u2019 In fact, if there was a snowball's chance in hell that 'woke' leftists would listen to Maher and only act slightly less crazy, conservatives would have a lot more to worry about in 2020. (Don\u2019t worry, Trump fans. That ain\u2019t happening.)\n\n\u201cReal Time\u201d doesn\u2019t pretend to be unbiased, but it\u2019s an honest, sincere look at American politics from a liberal worldview. But the fact that the liberal worldview is increasingly becoming disconnected from the \u201cwoke\u201d worldview is enough to keep plenty of conservatives interested, and watching.", "description": "Comedian Bill Maher is a liberal who hates President Trump, .09/30/2019 0:02:04AM EST.", "authors": ["Scott Morefield", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2015/350/a701aa29-e974-437e-834d-a2fd8d2d3279.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
