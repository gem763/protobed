And when we did not fall into that 10 per cent, I felt shame and disappointment,' she said.\n\nJodie Fox, 35, raised $30 million in investment for the online customised shoe company Shoes of Prey\n\nShe said the time after the company stopped trading was 'frightening', admitting she started to develop anxiety, depression and impostor syndrome.\n\n'It was so wild to come to a moment of clarity and realise that Shoes of Prey really was the love of my life and I was putting all of my energy into that \u2026 I didn't realise there were so many personal things I was not making time for, I didn't know I was making that mistake,' she said.\n\nMs Fox shared an Instagram post after the brand announced they were halting production, saying 'just like every company behind the scenes we faced struggles'.\n\n'While the all the data was positive, we were not really able to crack mass-market adoption.\n\n'We remain passionate and positive about our vision.'\n\nA statement released by Jodie Fox on Instagram explained in more depth why the business was halting production\n\nUS model Ashley Graham pictured backstage at a fashion event in 2017 wearing Shoes of Prey high heels\n\nAustralian swimsuit Robyn Lawley was also among the Shoes of Prey clientele - pictured wearing a pair of the brand's shoes in 2017\n\nSpeaking previously to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Fox explained why she decided to launch the company in the first place.\n\n'I'd always liked shoes, but I never loved them because I couldn't find exactly what I was looking for,' she said.\n\n'Either it wasn't quite the right colour, there was an embellishment I didn't like, or not quite the right heel height. I didn't love shoes until I could design them myself.'\n\nMore than six million shoes were designed on Shoes of Prey's website, shipping to 100 countries and being worn everywhere from the shops to the catwalk.", "description": "The brand Shoes of Prey, which was co-founded by Jodie Fox in 2009, became a global success appealing to fashion icons such as Rihanna, Kate Middleton and Elle Macpherson.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee", "Emilia Mazza", "Nic White For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/28/08/4F74B87900000578-0-image-a-8_1535441365265.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
