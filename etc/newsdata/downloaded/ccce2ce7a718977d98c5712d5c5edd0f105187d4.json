The idea is to listen in on encrypted audio or video calls in real-time, or extract chat logs from encrypted instant messaging apps.\n\nHow Swedish authorities will do this is unclear, but there are at least two routes. They can create the malware themselves, or they can buy it from contractors. The last option has been popular with law enforcement agencies across the world, and there's now a booming market for companies that sell hacking tools and exploits (also referred to as lawful intercept tools) to law enforcement agencies.\n\nDamberg also mentioned that Swedish police could also choose to deploy hardware devices capable of bypassing encryption, but he did not elaborate.\n\nThe new rules and capabilities are set to enter into effect on March 1, 2020. According to Damberg, police can only use these new capabilities if the crime someone is suspected is punishable by a penalty of four years or higher.", "description": "Spyware should be able to turn on device cameras and microphones, get encrypted chat logs.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/23/3616ce5a-08dd-4fd2-b461-0b86b4ed8355/thumbnail/770x578/146b8603a10a009f6b668fcb7ee97949/sweden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
