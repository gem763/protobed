She witnessed the sun rays rippling gently like a curtain of silk spreading over an enchanting paradise. Happy about having a much-needed escape from her stressful lifestyle and being able to spend some personal time with the family, she laid back trying to comfort herself on the grainy warm sand, savouring the essence of humid sea breeze swirling around. The soothing waves gently cascaded onto the shore, while at a distance she could see the palm trees lined in serried rows with their heads dipped in reverence to the might of the sea. Complementing the aesthetics was the melody of seagulls, chirping and singing as they soar overhead, searching for food, painting the morning sky with their strokes in the sunshine and then gradually fading into the dome of the sky.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful!\u201d she exclaimed, looking at her son. He was lying beside, fallen on his back, his head resting against the headrest of a beach chair. This was one of the rare occasions when he had successfully been persuaded to step out of his mundane routine. He wasn\u2019t the kind of person who would go out much. He usually seemed to find his peace indoors especially when the past few days had been difficult for him. His professional life seemed to have disrupted his share of peace and in response, rather than figuring a way out, he had simply submitted to it. To nobody\u2019s surprise, he had put on a lot of weight and his eyes were dark ringed, obviously indicating some sleepless nights. In response to her mother, he looked up for a moment, smiled hesitantly and then he was lost again in his world of thoughts as if captivated by it. Though every single presence around them seemed majestic and pure at that moment but to him, it made no difference.\n\nShe usually had enough in store to amuse her son but not today. She knew that he wasn\u2019t great at handling the stress and she had given him his share of space to deal with things but not today. Today she wanted to talk.\n\n\u201cLook around son, it\u2019s something that you might not get to see back home\u201d she spoke with a caring voice, as she moved closer to her son who seemed oblivious to his surroundings. He was constantly rubbing his hand onto the wet sand, digging his fingers deep.\n\nEven though it was dim early morning, there were still a plenty of people around- families with their trouser legs rolled up walking by the beachside, kids splashing water onto one another; couples walking barefoot holding their sandals near the shoreline; toddlers trying to taste sand and playing around with shells; youngsters jogging and stretching. It all seemed so lively, it appeared so heaven like as if the beach was dipped in the earthshine gold.\n\nHolding a plastic glass, she started pouring some sand with a spade and looked up at her son, asking-\n\n\u201cCan you guess what I\u2019m trying to do here?\u201d\n\n\u201cIntending to build your castle maybe?\u201d he replied\n\nOnce she was done filling it almost to the half, she turned and asked-\n\n\u201cCan you tell me the weight this glass holds?\u201d\n\nHe couldn\u2019t make any sense out of his mother\u2019s action yet just to respond, he uttered,\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess 150-200 gm?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I add a spade more?\u201d she wasn\u2019t ready to budge.\n\n\u201cUmm, probably 300 gm then. Look, I am not getting the point here.\u201d\n\nIgnoring the latter part of his statement, she then lifted the glass in her hands, asking-\n\n\u201cWhat if I hold this glass for the next 10 seconds? What do you think will happen?\u201d\n\nThe son, totally confused by now had given up asking questions.\n\n\u201cNothing, nothing will happen I guess\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I hold it for the next 10 min?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe your hand will start to ache.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I hold it for an hour then?\u201d\n\nWith a heavy sigh and in a state of wonder about what could have been possibly wrong with his mother this morning, he replied\n\n\u201cMaa, your hand will go numb. You\u2019ll hurt yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what if I hold it for a day?\u201d she persisted.\n\n\u201cMuscle stress, possibly paralysis? I think I\u2019ll be rushing you to the hospital then!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what do I need to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cPut that glass down!\u201d His voice was louder as he was irritated answering the stupid array of questions directed towards him this morning.\n\n\u201cExactly! Tell me one thing, did I add sand in any of the cases?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my point! Even though the weight of the glass remains the same, yet the longer I hold it, the heavier it starts to feel!\n\nSuddenly she seemed to be making some sense to him.\n\n\u201cThe sand that this glass holds is just like the negative thoughts and emotions that you hold right now. Some of it won\u2019t matter at all initially but when you let your mind hold them for long, you\u2019ll feel the weight. And if you hold them longer, it will cause pain, slowly make you numb and before you even realise what\u2019s happening, you\u2019ll feel paralyzed, incapable of using your mind.\u201d\n\nThe son couldn\u2019t react.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok to be bothered by the negativity that surrounds us,\u201d she continued, \u201cWe all are humans after-all but it\u2019s important to realise that in the end, we need to let it go! REMEMBER TO PUT THE GLASS DOWN!\u201d\n\nMoral:\n\nSomeone has rightly said-\n\n\u2018Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.\u2019\n\nThe question that we probably need to ask ourselves is- Why do I choose to suffer?", "description": "As the pulsing heart of the sea left its beat whistling through her ears, she rested, watching the sunrise from the distant edge of the sky and the deep sea.
