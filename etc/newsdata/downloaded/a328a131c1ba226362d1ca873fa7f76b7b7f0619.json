These changes gave Fidesz an \"undue advantage\", according to the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe.\n\nThe strategy was similarly deployed earlier this year in Turkey when opposition parties joined forces to take Istanbul, weakening President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party.\n\nThe candidate they've chosen to rally around is socialist Gergely Karacsony, currently at the helm of one of Budapest's districts. The 44-year-old has pledged to burnish the Hungarian capital's green credentials, tackle corruption, and alleviate the affordable housing shortage.\n\n'Stakes are high'\n\nHe told reporters on Friday that a victory would constitute \"the first serious check on power\" for the government, which he accused of centralising \"not just politics but the economy and the media\".\n\n\"Winning back the capital can prise open a crack in Viktor Orban's system,\" he added.\n\nSunday's municipal elections will be the last test for Fidesz until the parliamentary elections of 2022 and a loss would be highly symbolic. Orban's party has not lost an election since 2006, sweeping the board in local, parliamentary and European elections since then.\n\nAdditionally, the capital is home to over 15% of the country's population and accounts for about 30% of its economy.\n\nFor Andras Piko, the opposition candidate in the capital's eighth district, a victory would allow the opposition \"to build a power-base and get access to resources\".\n\n\"If it shows it can govern, it can then mount a serious challenge to Orban in 2022,\" he went on, adding: \"the stakes are high.\"", "description": "Five opposition parties have joined forces to support a single, common candidate in Sunday's municipal election in Budapest: 44-year-old socialist Gergely Karacsony.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/57/04/1000x563_cmsv2_425f5be3-ca19-5a1c-96f4-55ca16edb309-4225704.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
