The eight-minute short, Battle at Big Rock, takes place one year after Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and picks up where the last film ended: dinosaurs are now freely roaming around the world and, inevitably, there are some problems.\n\nBattle at Big Rock has everything a Jurassic Park fan would want \u2014 family drama, dinosaurs crushing vans, and even a badass eight-year-old with a crossbow. Whether this family will make an appearance in Jurassic World 3 (set to be released in 2021 and also directed by Trevorrow) is unclear. There\u2019s certainly no sign of Chris Pratt\u2019s Owen Grady or Bryce Dallas Howard\u2019s Claire Dearing.\n\nBattle at Big Rock first debuted exclusively on FX, but is also available to watch on NBC.com, JurassicWorld.com, and YouTube.", "description": "A new Jurassic World short, directed by Colin Trevorrow, who also helmed the first Jurassic World in 2015, has arrived.
