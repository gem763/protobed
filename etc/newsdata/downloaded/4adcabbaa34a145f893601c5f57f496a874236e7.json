Democrats swept to victory in last year\u2019s midterm elections partly based on suburban voters, taking back the House of Representatives, where an impeachment inquiry against Trump is now under way.\n\nDemocratic wins in the suburbs included a district in South Carolina they had not won for 40 years, the one-time Ronald Reagan stronghold of Orange county, California, and parts of Texas itself. Although Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke fell short against Republican Ted Cruz in a Texas Senate race, his surge fuelled hopes that Democrats can even turn the Lone Star state blue.\n\nIn the aftermath of the midterms, Eric Cantor, the former Republican House majority leader, wrote in the New York Times: \u201cThere is no doubt that some of the loss in support this year from college-educated women, for example, is a result of the negative opinion these voters have of President Trump.\n\n\u201cBut it is also true that Republicans have not had much to offer suburban voters on what they consistently say are their top issues, including health care, child care, education, the environment and transportation.\u201d", "description": "Secret recording of Texas House speaker and influential conservative indicates worries about waning support in suburbs", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beaefe9713c0d78a710a1a70dcd17f488049041c/0_0_5374_3224/master/5374.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=744d5a239557db93210497e88017e611", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
