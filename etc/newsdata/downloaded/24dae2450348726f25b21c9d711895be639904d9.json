REUTERS/Sukree Sukplang/Files\n\nIn another volatile day of trading for UK assets, financial markets remained hostage to news as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU negotiators raced against the clock to forge a withdrawal agreement before an EU summit on Thursday.\n\nNegotiators were struggling to clinch an 11th-hour deal, raising the chances that Johnson will have to seek an extension of the Oct. 31 deadline for Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc.\n\nSterling has surged some 5% since late last week, when London and Brussels restarted intense negotiations.\n\nBut on Wednesday sources in the bloc said the talks had hit a \u201cstandstill\u201d.\n\nDisagreements centre on a future trade deal and the rejection by Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which supports the ruling Conservative Party in the British parliament, of customs arrangements tentatively agreed by negotiators for the Irish border.\n\nThe DUP\u2019s leader Arlene Foster dismissed an earlier report that her party had come round to an agreement.\n\n\u201cIt looks like a deal is being worked on but everyone who works with the EU knows that these deals happen at the last minute,\u201d said Kit Juckes, head of currency strategy at Societe Generale in London. \u201cIt seems more likely than not that we will need an extension.\u201d\n\nAt 1540 GMT, sterling was up 0.5% at $1.2844, having earlier rallied to $1.2855, a new 5-month high, on optimism that the DUP was coming round to a deal.\n\nAgainst the euro, the pound was 0.2% stronger on the day at 86.160 pence - but off five-month highs hit earlier.\n\nSterling trading volumes have surged in recent days. On Tuesday, investors bought and sold more pounds than on any single day since November 2018, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nLondon-listed companies that make their cash at home, from housebuilders to banks, on Wednesday reversed some of the ground gained since last week.\n\nThese domestically focused stocks, some of the world\u2019s most unloved shares in recent years, have seen their fortunes transform since Friday - JPMorgan\u2019s domestic basket has outperformed London-listed exporter peers and the blue-chip FTSE 100.\n\nBritain\u2019s mid-cap stocks index FTSE 250 cut its losses from the morning and was last down marginally. Ireland\u2019s main stocks index fell 0.5%.\n\n\u201cUK equities have started to look more interesting. We\u2019ve been on the negative side for some time, (but) I wouldn\u2019t be so pessimistic there any more because valuations have started to look more attractive. A lot of bad stuff is priced in,\u201d said Legal & General Investment Management strategist Lars Kreckel.\n\n\u201cIf the Brexit issue were to disappear or become less prominent, you could have some flows returning to UK equities.\u201d\n\nFor a graphic on UK domestic vs exporter stocks, click here\n\nTrading in sterling options suggested high volatility in the currency was likely one way or another.\n\nBritish government bonds benefited from the renewed uncertainty, with 10-year yields broadly flat on the day at 0.706%.\n\nWith the spotlight on Brexit, September inflation data had little market impact. Britain\u2019s inflation rate failed to rise as expected last month as petrol prices fell at the fastest rate in more than three years, a boost to consumers ahead of Brexit.", "description": "Sterling swung around five-month highs on Wednesday and stocks in London cut their losses amid a blizzard of contradictory headlines about whether Britain and the European Union were on the verge of agreeing a Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Dhara Ranasinghe", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441405766&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0L2", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
