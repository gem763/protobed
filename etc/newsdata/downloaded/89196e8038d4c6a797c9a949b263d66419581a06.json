If you go through with impeachment, though, you divide the country further, you take the oxygen away from your candidates, and you still don\u2019t solve the problem of foreign interference. Just because you impeach a president, it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t still have the foreign interference.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a big mess,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
