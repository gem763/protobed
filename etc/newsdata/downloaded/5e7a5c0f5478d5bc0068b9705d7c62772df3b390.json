Americans have been groaning about the non-stop election cycle ever since.\n\nWell, it appears we\u2019ve entered the never-ending presidential impeachment campaign, as well.\n\nPresident Trump Donald John TrumpDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Trump adviser: 'He should stop saying things that are untrue' US moves British ISIS suspects from Syria amid Turkish invasion MORE\u2019s alleged quid-pro-quo offer to the Ukrainian president spurred the latest push for impeachment. This was the first time Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Trey Gowdy joins Trump's legal team Tillis says impeachment is 'a waste of resources' MORE (D-Calif.) greenlighted an impeachment inquiry. This time, there was enough support among Democrats in the House, where an impeachment action must be initiated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd now Democrats are in full-blown impeachment mode, struggling to develop a coherent and unified message to explain why the president must be impeached, even though they know the Republican-led Senate won\u2019t have the two-thirds vote needed to confirm the House\u2019s actions.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget, a push to keep Trump from the White House started the day after the presidential election. Efforts began immediately to keep Trump from even taking the oath of office.\n\nActor Martin Sheen and other celebrities cut an ad encouraging Republican electors, whose vote in the Electoral College actually decides the election, not to vote for Trump \u2014 even though most electors had sworn an oath to vote for the candidate who won the state. That was only the beginning.\n\nRight after the Electoral College tally concluded in January, several Democratic members of Congress objected to the results of the election. Then-Vice President Joe Biden, who was presiding, finally lamented to his fellow Democrats, \u201cIt is over.\u201d\n\nExcept, of course, it wasn\u2019t \u2014 at least not for some Democrats.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn April 2017, Rep.

The answer may be as simple as this tellingly honest assessment by Rep. Green: \u201cI\u2019m concerned that if we don\u2019t impeach the president, he will get reelected.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem with the impeachment effort is two can \u2014 and likely will \u2014 play at this game.\n\nSome day a Democrat will be in the White House again \u2014 maybe as soon as January 2021. An impeachment door has been opened that Republicans will be tempted to walk through.\n\nIf a Democrat wins the White House next year, Republicans are likely to feel Democrats\u2019 impeachment efforts robbed Trump of reelection, and dog the next officeholder for the remainder of his or her presidency.\n\nRepublicans would be on the lookout for impeachable offenses, or at least actions that could be portrayed as impeachable and for hints of foreign interference.\n\nAnd if Republicans were to retake the House, they could initiate endless rounds of investigations, subpoena members of the administration to appear before Congress and demand transcripts of possibly sensitive presidential conversations with foreign leaders that no president (or foreign leader) wants released \u2014 just like Democrats are doing.\n\nDo we really want to go down this road?\n\nWhen Senate Democrats voted in 2013 to eliminate the filibuster for judicial nominees, excluding the Supreme Court, many people warned they would come to regret that move \u2014 and they have.\n\nThey may also come to regret setting into motion the never-ending impeachment process. I know most Americans surely will.\n\nMerrill Matthews is a resident scholar with the Institute for Policy Innovation in Dallas, Texas.
