In it, she sought Mnuchin\u2019s views on what triggered the spike in rates for repurchase agreements and expressed concern about potential costs to businesses and consumers if strains persist.\n\nShe also set herself up for another fight with Wall Street, citing a Reuters article reporting that large banks were using the repo-market chaos to pressure the Federal Reserve to weaken liquidity rules \u201cthey have long despised.\u201d Warren said she\u2019s concerned the Financial Stability Oversight Council, whose chair is Mnuchin, might support those efforts.\n\n\u201cThese rules were designed to ensure that banks have enough cash on hand to meet their obligations in the event of another market crash,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBanks are reporting profits at record levels, and it would be painfully ironic if unexplained chaos in a small corner of the banking market became an excuse to further loosen rules that protect the economy from these types of risks.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury Department declined to comment on Warren\u2019s letter. On Oct. 16, in response to a reporter\u2019s question, Mnuchin rejected the notion that the U.S. government\u2019s heavy issuance of debt contributed to the tumult and instead blamed a corporate tax deadline for draining money from the banking system. The jump in rates on Sept. 17 \u201chad nothing to do with our issuance, it had to do with the big tax day, that we were taking cash out of the market,\u201d he said.\n\nBanking industry complaints about regulations have gotten louder since the mid-September dislocation. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said Oct. 15 that the bank had the money and inclination to step in when rates surged, but liquidity rules prevented it from doing so.\n\nRegulations introduced after the 2008 crisis oblige financial institutions to hold more cash and cash-like assets as a buffer against times of stress, and systemically important banks -- JPMorgan is the largest in the U.S. -- face year-end reviews to determine how much more common equity they must carry. Analysts at JPMorgan argued this week that money-market stress is likely to get much worse despite the Fed\u2019s attempts to fix the problem.\n\nThe central bank has been injecting liquidity into the funding markets since Sept. 17, when the rate on overnight general collateral repo jumped to 10% from around 2%. The Fed has also begun buying Treasury bills to add reserves back into the system. These efforts have mostly calmed repo rates.\n\n\u201cWhile the Federal Reserve has taken the necessary action to ensure that markets continue to function, I am alarmed that it has been required to engage in money market interventions that have not been used since the 2008 financial crisis,\u201d wrote Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts.\n\nWarren came to prominence because of her criticisms of Wall Street and calls for tougher oversight of the financial industry after the 2008 financial crisis. Her advocacy was pivotal to the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and helped lock in her election to the Senate.\n\nWarren asked that Mnuchin respond to these and other questions no later than Nov. 1:\n\nWhat are the underlying causes of the spike in borrowing rates for overnight repurchase agreements?Has FSOC learned why the Fed announced on Oct. 11 that overnight operations meant to keep the calm would be extended at least through January of next year?How will FSOC and Treasury use data on centrally cleared repo transactions to gain a further understanding of the market? Is further information needed to sufficiently monitor the short-term lending market?\n\n(Updates with Mnuchin comment on repo from last week in fifth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Michael Shepard, Saleha Mohsin and Anna Edgerton.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Emily Barrett in New York at ebarrett25@bloomberg.net;Alexandra Harris in New York at aharris48@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Nick Baker, Jenny Paris\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren waded into last month\u2019s turmoil in short-term funding markets, warning Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin not to use the incident as a rationale for weakening post-financial crisis regulations.Warren, a front-runner in the race to challenge Donald Trump in", "authors": ["Emily Barrett", "Alexandra Harris"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RjAtZCFJWByERNcr4ICkXw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/59df97cfdc01202b1346455306e8ea8b", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
