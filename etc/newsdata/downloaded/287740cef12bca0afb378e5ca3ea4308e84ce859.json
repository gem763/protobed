The plan recommends we become the first city in the UK to introduce a small area diesel ban for all vehicles, plus a charging zone for non-compliant commercial vehicles https://t.co/KaAHR2iMRY pic.twitter.com/ZypZyhvRTQ \u2014 Bristol City Council (@BristolCouncil) October 29, 2019\n\nMayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, said: 'These ambitious plans demonstrate our commitment to tackling air pollution so we meet legal limits within the shortest time, without disproportionally affecting citizens on lower incomes which would happen with a blanket approach to charging vehicles.\n\n'Protecting the most vulnerable people from pollution is central to these plans and we have ensured that all impacts have been carefully considered.\n\n'If approved, mitigation measures will support those most affected, especially those living in the most deprived communities.'\n\nThe plans are due to be presented to the city council's cabinet on Tuesday 5 November.\n\nIf approved, the proposals will then be submitted to the Joint Air Quality Unit - a team setup by the Department for Transport and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to specifically deliver changes to reduce pollution to meet EU limits.\n\nA thumbs up from the government department would see the ban and congestion charge zone introduced in less than two year's time.\n\nIf given the green light by the government, the extreme measures would be introduced in March 2021 - making Bristol the first UK city to impose a ban on all diesel cars in a specific area\n\nRAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said Bristol City Council's proposals were 'unprecedented'.\n\n'Major routes into, out of, and even around the city \u2013 like Temple Way and Brunel Way \u2013 would become out of bounds, with diesel vehicles forced onto other roads, which risks causing congestion problems where they don\u2019t exist at the moment,' Lyes warned.\n\n'Bristol has bold plans to improve its public transport system, but major improvements like its mooted rapid transit system or even more park and ride sites are still many years from becoming a reality.\n\n'In the meantime, many drivers are faced with having to use their car for journeys in and around the city simply because there is no affordable, reliable alternatives. This would become more difficult under these plans.'\n\nLyes also said the ban could have a huge impact on those with diesel cars on lease or finance packages that will still be in place when the ban is due to be put in place.\n\nThese drivers could face large financial penalties for attempting to exit their contracts early.\n\n'There will also be drivers of older vehicles who are faced with having to give up their vehicles and switch to something different \u2013 which could be extremely costly,' he added.\n\n'The devil will be in the detail, but we are concerned that a scrappage scheme would not prove effective in getting people into cleaner cars, since such schemes are designed to get people into brand-new \u2013 and still more costly - vehicles.'\n\nBristol is the sixth biggest city in the UK with a population of around 617,000 people - more than Glasgow, Edinburgh and Leeds.\n\nLocals have been responding to the proposal online, claiming it is no more than a taxation on motorists and will fail to reduce emissions.", "description": "All diesel passenger vehicles will be banned from a 'small area' of the city, while a wider congestion charge zone would be implemented for commercial vehicles, buses and taxis.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
