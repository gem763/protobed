The first nine times a team did that \u2014 from the 1914 Philadelphia Athletics to the 1972 Cincinnati Reds \u2014 it never recovered.\n\nThat is where the Houston Astros found themselves late Wednesday night, after a tight Game 2 devolved into a 12-3 thrashing by the Washington Nationals at Minute Maid Park. The teams head to Nationals Park for Game 3 on Friday, and the Astros will pack their swagger.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of teams win 107 games a year,\u201d shortstop Carlos Correa said. \u201cThis is a special team; this is not just a random team. If there\u2019s a team out there that can do it, it\u2019s us.\u201d\n\nThe Astros may be further emboldened by the fate of three of the last four teams to fall into this trap. The 1985 Kansas City Royals, the 1986 Mets and the 1996 Yankees all lost the first two games at home but ended up winning the title. The 1999 Atlanta Braves did not, and the situation has not arisen since.
