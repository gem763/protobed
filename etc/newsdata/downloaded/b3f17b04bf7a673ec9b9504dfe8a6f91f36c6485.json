It did so thanks to a proper weekly watering of the crop, in this case with the tears willfully shed each week from its legion of fans desperate for a good Mandy Moore-generated cry.\n\nAttempts at replicating the NBC hit\u2019s tone and success have run the gamut, from suicide and secrets to an altruistic doctor who is battling cancer himself. But Almost Family gets credit for taking the biggest swing at a premise, and for whiffing it with gusto: What if we did This Is Us, but with medical rape?\n\nOnce you learn the plot of Almost Family, which premieres Wednesday on Fox, the tone it takes is patently outrageous. The only thing more surprising is that, when asked about the borderline insanity of the choice to take such a lighthearted, heartwarming hand with the grave subject matter, the show\u2019s creators and producers seemed caught entirely off guard. At least that\u2019s how it appeared at a press conference with TV critics this summer.\n\nYou see, Almost Family is a series that attempts to explore unconventional family dynamics, raising questions of what connects us, and what constitutes a family. It is also a series about sperm.\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Daily Beast\u2019s Obsessed Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture.

While presenting him with a lifetime achievement award for his work, his daughter Julia (Brittany Snow), who also works with him, says, \u201cI\u2019m still the little girl who thinks he\u2019s a God, because I\u2019ve seen him make miracles happen, make families.\u201d\n\nJust as your heartstrings start to get that little tingle, though, there\u2019s a dramatic twist. It comes to light that, in order to boost his track record of helping couples get pregnant, Dr. Bechley supplemented his patients\u2019 samples with his own \u201cmaterial,\u201d as the show repeatedly and revoltingly puts it. Over the years, that\u2019s amounted to over 100 children he\u2019s fathered by impregnating patients with his own sperm, without their knowledge. It\u2019s truly a joy to think this much about Timothy Hutton\u2019s sperm.\n\nThere are all kinds of terms and euphemisms for what Dr. Bechley did. Fraud. Nonconsensual insemination. It\u2019s near the end of the first episode that the term \u201csexual assault\u201d is finally used. TV reporters interrogating the show\u2019s creators used the term \u201cmedical rape,\u201d though the r-word is definitely not used in Almost Family. That would really sour the mood of the whole thing.\n\nThis is obviously a rich topic to explore. (Almost Family is based on an Australian series called Sisters that ran for one season.) Infertility practices were a Wild West for much of the \u201980s and \u201990s. Now, with DNA testing so prevalent and commonly used, the repercussions of that sort of biological lawlessness are starting to come to light. For some patients and families, that is a happy thing. For others, the discoveries are harrowing and life-altering, as in the bombshell report of Dr. Donald Cline, the infertility doctor who, like Dr. Bechley on Almost Family, impregnated dozens of women while secretly using his own sperm.\n\nAlmost Family makes the decision to focus almost entirely on the children who discover they are one of the #BechleyBabies. (Yep, they\u2019re given a hashtag.) Only one of the women who was defrauded has anything to say about it, telling her daughter, \u201cI\u2019m your mother. I carried you. That\u2019s what matters\u2014not what ended up in some test tube.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one arguably valid reaction to the news. Another would be the feeling of gross violation, the realization that in return for the trust you put in a doctor you became a victim of sexual assault, that what was just science and \u201cresults\u201d to him was so much more than that to you: actual human life brought into this world, now left to grapple with this. These are things that would beg exploration, but are largely ignored, at least in the first two episodes of Almost Family given to critics.\n\nInstead we\u2019re given the story of three girls who discover that they are sisters, each coming to terms\u2014even thrilled\u2014with the fact that they\u2019re now part of a larger, extended family. New siblings! What fun!\n\nThat Snow\u2019s character, Julia, ended up having sex with another #BechleyBaby? Kooky plot twist. That Megalyn Echikunwoke\u2019s Edie grew up with Dr. Bechley as a close family friend, spending holidays together without any idea that he was her father? Well, that needs to be dealt with some other time, because right now she is the lawyer defending him in his criminal case. That\u2019s right! She\u2019s defending him! I! Can\u2019t! Believe! It!\n\nThe tone of the series is familiar to anyone with executive producer Jason Katims\u2019 work: the Friday Night Lights and About a Boy series and, most analogous to this, Parenthood. The whole thing is meant to be uplifting, mining the emotion that heals us all from the drama of an event like this instead of the darkness. When the show\u2019s three leads\u2014Emily Osment plays Roxie, another surprise sibling\u2014get their DNA tests back once the Dr. Bechley news breaks, they look at each other with tears misting in their eyes as the music swells. \u201cWe\u2019re\u2026\u201d \u201c...genetically connected...\u201d \u201c...family.\u201d\n\n\u201c Almost Family makes the decision to focus almost entirely on the children who discover they are one of the #BechleyBabies. (Yep, they\u2019re given a hashtag.) \u201d\n\n\"It's ultimately a story about identity and a story about family,\u201d Katims told TV reporters over the summer at the Television Critics Association press tour, as said reporters slapped their foreheads with their palms. \u201cIt's a story where we\u2019re asking the question, 'What is family?' One of the things that I find so charming and beautiful about this story is that these three women, as adults, are discovering that they are sisters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat really attracted me to this story was that, was telling this beautiful, unconventional family story in a way that we haven't seen before,\u201d he continued. That much is true.\n\nIs it possible to move beyond aghast feelings over the premise and tone, and judge the series on its other merits? A Jason Katims superfan, surely I would be seduced by the show\u2019s sweetness and emotionality anyway, right? Well... no. I couldn\u2019t make the leap.\n\nIt must be said that Snow is an incredibly engaging performer, and, as Julia, she plays the most torment and anger over her father\u2019s actions, convincingly conflicted over still loving this man she\u2019s idolized her whole life and the person who did this egregious thing. On the opposite end of the spectrum is Osment\u2019s Roxie, who couldn\u2019t be more over the moon about this exciting new development in her life. The two actresses are fantastic, largely because their plots tend to be the least ridiculous. (The less said about Edie\u2019s bisexual love triangle storyline, the better.)\n\nWhat I do wonder though is whether everyone else will be just fine with the show at face value. It\u2019s cute, it\u2019s tear-jerking, it\u2019s got an intriguing plot. But that\u2019s why it\u2019s so outrageous to me that this is the tone the show takes. There\u2019s responsibility to be had in the way a story is presented. It\u2019s not that TV viewers are lemmings who will watch whatever\u2019s put in front of them. It\u2019s that, as the show\u2019s first episode, it\u2019s almost too easy to gloss over the severity of a story like this, one that arguably deserves to be told, and instead present it in this sunkissed way.", "description": "A new series about an infertility doctor who impregnated patients with his own sperm is somehow turned into a heartwarming family drama.
