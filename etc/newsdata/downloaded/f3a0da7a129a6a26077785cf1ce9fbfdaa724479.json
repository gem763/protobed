But the way the media reports on our national economy weighs on consumer sentiment, which feeds into consumer purchases and investments.\u201d Those are the words of Tomas Phillipson, President Trump\u2019s acting Council of Economic Advisers Chairman, as spoken to Jim Tankersley and Jeanna Smialek of the New York Times. Phillipson\u2019s comment is a reminder that some conservatives can unsheathe the victim card as ably as their reliably outraged opponents on the left.\n\nThe media can talk down the economy? What can Phillipson possibly mean? Why did Tankersley and Smialek so readily accept such ludicrous reasoning from Phillipson?\n\nMissed by those who view consumption as the driver of growth is that we all have theoretically infinite desires to consume that are logically only limited by our individual ability to produce. West Virginia isn\u2019t poor relative to Texas because its people don\u2019t consume as much; rather they consume less because they produce less. Consumption is a consequence of production, not a driver. Keynesians get it backwards.\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s so unfortunate about Phillipson\u2019s response. Not only is it sappy victimology, not only does it ascribe a power to the media that plainly doesn\u2019t exist, but it also speaks to a misunderstanding of how economies work. Simply put, there\u2019s never a problem of insufficient consumption.\n\nConsider Phillipson himself. It\u2019s not unreasonable to suggest that he has savings. If so, his alleged failure to consume in no way detracts from consumption. Figure that banks would be quickly insolvent if they paid him a rate of interest on funds deposited, only to sit on the funds. More realistically, any money not spent by Phillipson is rapidly loaned out to those who will.\n\nBut the bigger story here is that assuming what\u2019s not serious, that the media could convince Americans that the economic sky is falling, this would if anything exist as a boost for the economy. Think about it.\n\nWhat are businesses constantly in search of, but often fruitlessly? The answer is kind of simple: businesses are endlessly searching for capital, for the savings of others that they can use to build up their inventories, invest in existing employees, hire new ones, etc. It\u2019s a frequent theme of this column, but one can never stress too often the basic truth that innovations and subsequent productivity increases are almost always a function of investment. Assuming reduced spending that results from media fear mongering, the consumption drop off will work as an economic boost for businesses being able to access capital from a more abundant pool of same.\n\nSavings are the driver of economic growth simply because there\u2019s no growth without investment, and that\u2019s a major reason why untouched recessions result in much bigger economic booms. It\u2019s the reduction of spending that boosts capital availability, and it\u2019s the growth of capital availability that gradually redounds to increased productivity. Repeat it over and over again: there\u2019s never a problem of deficient consumption. There can only be production deficiencies.\n\nSo while the notion of media talking down the economy is baseless, presidents have power that the media lack. They do because dollar policy, and in particular dollar exchange rate policy, is part of the U.S. Treasury\u2019s portfolio.\n\nThis rates prominent mention given a Tweet from President Trump last week. He wrote,\n\n\u201cThe Euro is dropping against the Dollar \u2018like crazy, giving them a big export and manufacturing advantage\u2026and the Fed does NOTHING! Our Dollar is now the strongest in history. Sounds good, doesn\u2019t it. Except to those (manufacturers) that make product for sale outside the U.S.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s so much wrong with Trump\u2019s argument. First off, a weak dollar in no way enhances the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers. They\u2019re reliant on imported inputs, which means a weak dollar raises the cost of producing all manner of goods and services manufactured in the U.S.\n\nWhere it gets funny and sad at the same time is that a falling dollar is logically anti-saving, which means it\u2019s anti-investment. If the dollar is in decline, those with extra funds have every incentive to spend them with abandon. Why delay consumption if the dollars saved will be exchangeable for less down the line? Along similar lines, why commit capital to new ideas if any returns will come back in dollars exchangeable for less? Absent productivity-boosting investment, it\u2019s difficult for companies to be competitive.\n\nTo all this, Trump and his partisans will say that the dollar \u201cis now the strongest in history,\u201d but it isn\u2019t. Goodness, the dollar purchased 360 yen in 1971, 250 in 1985, yet now it purchases 105. As for the euro, when the 21st century began the dollar dwarfed the euro. Now it isn\u2019t even exchangeable for one. But the main thing is that every global currency floats. That the dollar is lately \u201cstronger\u201d than the euro and yen only means something insofar as all of the currencies can be measured against something objective. Looked at in terms of gold, the dollar reached its lowest point in August of 2011 when gold rose to $1,900, but at $1,554 the greenback is nearing historical lows.\n\nSo while the dollar is \u201cstrong\u201d of late, it only is versus floating currencies that are weaker than the rapidly weakening dollar. This is what Trump wants, and markets are complying. It will be an investment negative. During periods of devaluation, wealth that already exists (like gold) becomes attractive to investors seeking protection from devaluation. During periods of dollar stability, wealth that doesn\u2019t yet exist (think stock and bond income streams) becomes a more attractive savings destination. It\u2019s investment in what doesn\u2019t yet exist that powers growth, yet Trump\u2019s devaluationist policies are favoring a blast to the past.\n\nIt\u2019s something for readers to think about, and for Trump partisans to ponder. He\u2019s had successes and failures in his presidency as all do. Crucial here is that no presidency since 1971 has prospered amid a falling dollar. It\u2019s once again anti-investment, which means it\u2019s anti economic growth. Hopefully someone inside the Trump administration relays this to a president who is often wrong about dollar policy, but never in doubt.", "description": "\u0093The way the media reports the weather won\u0092t impact whether the sun shines tomorrow.
