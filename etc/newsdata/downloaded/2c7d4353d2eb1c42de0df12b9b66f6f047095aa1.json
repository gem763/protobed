However, the talks between Britain's Brexit negotiator David Frost and the EU's executive European Commission went well past midnight in Brussels, and were set to resume on Wednesday.\n\nThe EU will determine whether a deal is fit to be put to Thursday's leaders' summit for consideration, but even then there is a question whether Britain's minority government could win approval for any deal from the country's divided parliament.\n\n\"Watching the UK news channels last night, the arithmetic for achieving said approval is challenging to say the least,\" analysts at National Australia Bank wrote in a note.\n\nMany Asian share markets still held some gains in the wake of Tuesday gains by U.S. and European equities.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ( ) rose 0.4% while Japan's Nikkei ( ) jumped 1.5%, hitting 10-month highs.\n\nSouth Korea's KOSPI index ( ) climbed 0.6%, encouraged by South Korea's central bank cutting its policy interest rate for the second time in three months.\n\nStronger-than-expected earnings from major U.S. banks JPMorgan (N: ), Citigroup (N: ) and Wells Fargo (N: ) also boosted equities even as the International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2019 global growth forecast for a fifth time.\n\nIndeed, news on the U.S.-China trade front has been less encouraging.\n\nBloomberg reported, citing sources, that China will struggle to buy $50 billion of U.S. farm goods annually unless it removes retaliatory tariffs on American products, which would require reciprocal action by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nChina also said Beijing resolutely opposed new measures passed by the U.S. House of Representatives related to the Hong Kong protests and urged lawmakers to stop interfering.\n\nThe news helped to lift the safe-haven Japanese yen from a 2-1/2 month low hit on Tuesday against the dollar.\n\nThe yen stood at 108.68 per dollar, compared to Tuesday's low of 108.90.\n\nThe dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies ( ) hovered near three-week lows at 98.316. The euro ( ) was little changed at $1.1032.\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude ( ) added 10 cents to $58.84 a barrel, while U.S. crude ( ) rose 7 cents to $52.88 after falling the previous session over fears the unrelenting U.S.-China trade war would keep squeezing the global economy.\n\nfirmed slightly to $1,483.86 an ounce.", "description": "Shares lose steam, sterling off five-month peak with Brexit talks set to resume", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9F024_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
