Among Apple\u2019s highest expenditures as part of its United contract include 50 business class seats from San Francisco to Shanghai daily, a figure United printed on a sign and mistakenly placed in public viewing at SFO early this year.\n\nApple buys 50 United business class flights from San Francisco to Shanghai daily\n\nThose seats are necessary due to the sheer volume of Apple employees that travel daily between the US and China. Apple also sends employees to numerous other countries where it has supply chain infrastructure, business partners, and other logistics operations.\n\nWhile the Shanghai flights cost Apple around $35 million a year, it spends an additional $115 million or so on flights to top destinations like Hong Kong, Taipei, Seoul, Tokyo, London, and Singapore. All of this data, listed as confidential on United\u2019s banner, became public information back in January, although United quickly took the sign down and pledged to \u201creview and further restrict sharing of internal customer information to a strictly need-to-know audience.\u201d\n\nAs of right now, the SFO deal is far from concrete \u2014 we don\u2019t know if Apple may just kick in some money or if it might actually have a hand in any of the design. But members of Apple have visited United\u2019s SFO terminal, Bloomberg reports. \u201cThe Apple team in San Francisco has been in our baggage hold areas, customer service and the lobbies,\u201d Linda Jojo, an executive vice president at United\u2019s holding company, told members of the media at a press event in Chicago today. \u201cI\u2019m being deliberately vague,\u201d she added, perhaps to avoid directly insinuating prematurely that Apple has agreed to any such deal.", "description": "Apple is in early discussions with United Airlines about helping upgrade the company\u2019s San Francisco International Airport terminal, according to a report from Bloomberg.
