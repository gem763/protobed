Eleven months into fiscal 2019, the number of white-collar cases is expected to be the lowest annual total ever recorded in TRAC's database,which goes back to 1986.\n\n\"It's not just generally down,\" said Susan Long, TRAC's co-director. \"The pattern of white-collar prosecution is a whole lot lower than they used to be.\"\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the number of white-collar prosecutions regularly neared 10,000 a year. In the past three years, though, the number of cases has not topped 6,000.\n\nWhile Trump administration officials are generally seen as more focused on immigration crimes than corporate wrongdoing, and the administration has said it doesn't want multiple federal agencies piling onto the same corporate criminal cases, Long noted that the white-collar decline precedes Donald Trump.\n\nFederal white-collar prosecutions reached a high in 2011 under President Obama and have been dropping ever since. In fact, the annual numbers under the Trump administration are not that much lower than the number of cases brought in the final years of the Obama era.\n\n\"It's a matter of resources and staffing and competing priorities,\" Long said.\n\nTake out immigration cases, which often get prosecuted as identity theft, and the number of white-collar cases would be even lower, she noted. Of the overall drop, however, \"It is not something that a lot of people have noticed,\" she said.\n\nJohn Coffee, a Columbia University Law School professor and expert on white-collar crime, said the drop-off in prosecutions may simply be a sign of how far we are from the financial crisis. Public outcry against corporate wrongdoing \u2014 higher in the early part of this decade \u2014 has died down.\n\nBrandon Garrett, a professor at Duke Law School and author of \"Too Big to Jail,\" prefers to track punishments for white-collar crime rather than just the number of cases being brought. He said fines against corporations dropped dramatically in the second half of 2017. \"If you look at the past 18 to 20 months, there is no comparison to the Obama years,\" Garrett said.\n\nWhile it is possible there is less corporate crime than there used to be, Garrett's guess is the falloff is a matter of enforcement. \"My sense is that there may be some serious corporate crime going on that is just not being punished,\" he said.", "description": "Donald Trump's pro-business policies are only part of the reason, as numbers have been falling since peaking in 2011", "authors": ["Stephen Gandel"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/26/d7b80491-7b4b-492f-9961-e90b7bc0bf95/thumbnail/1200x630/26fc1c9baa9f51b03c69c92f8c27c407/gettyimages-183291204.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
