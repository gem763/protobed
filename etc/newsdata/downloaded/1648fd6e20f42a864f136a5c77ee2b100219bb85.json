It offers an excellent case study for the journey of digital transformation and what it can achieve in terms of a company transformation.\n\n\u00c5shild Hanne Larsen, CIO and Senior Vice President Corporate IT, Statoil ASA, Ouriel Lancry Partner, Bain & Company Inc., and Mehran Gul, Project Lead, Digital Transformation of Industries at the World Economic Forum, recently wrote about Statoil\u2019s path to digitisation in \u201cA step-by-step guide to digital transformation\u201d.\n\nThey didn\u2019t gild the lily, writing that, \u201ctransforming a company into a digital enterprise is tough. Many companies have had some success, but few have completed this metamorphosis. No comprehensive playbook, or even checklist, exists for executives to follow\u201d.\n\nAccording to Equinor, however, and the authors\u2019 WEF case study, the transformation has been a successful one, with the company trumpeting that, \u201cdigitisation is on everyone\u2019s lips these days\u2014but at Equinor, it\u2019s already part of our DNA. Our story is one of innovation and technological development\u201d.\n\nThe company goes on to say that the technology is not an end in itself.\n\nRather, Equinor is investing in digitisation, \u201cnot because digitisation and innovation are goals in themselves, but because digitisation is a key enabler for our strategy. We will produce oil and gas more effectively with lower greenhouse gas emissions, be a leader within carbon capture and storage, and invest substantially in renewable energy\u201d.\n\nTrine Svalestad, head of digitalisation on the Johan Sverdrup field, says that digitisation is \u201cabout streamlining and being more efficient,\u201d which, in turn, frees her up from repetitive tasks, allowing her to challenge herself and pursue innovation. She continues:\n\n\u201cOur job is to use digitalisation to increase safety, improve earnings and reduce carbon emissions on a field which, at peak production, will account for 25 percent of all Norwegian oil and gas production.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a theme echoed by Bjorn Otto Sverdrup, Senior Vice President of Sustainability at Equinor, who told Forbes, \u201cwe really believe that technology and digitalization will turn the industry upside down, for the better. Technology has the potential to rapidly bring down costs, make operations safer, and lower our carbon footprint. And digitalization is a key priority\u201d.\n\nAnd Equinor is using technology to be more sustainable too, he said, noting the company is using \u201csensors that can detect methane leaks at the wellsite and provide real-time data to understand what\u2019s really happening\u201d. This helps the team fix problems as fast as possible when they appear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about running a smarter business, it\u2019s also about running a more sustainable business,\u201d Sverdrup adds.\n\nLooking back to Larsen and her colleagues\u2019 case study at the WEF, it\u2019s clear that as Statoil, Equinor was asking the very same questions many companies are now asking themselves. The four questions Larsen and her co-authors said they asked were:\n\n1. How do we balance investment for today\u2019s opportunities with investment for the future?\n\n2. How do we win the war for digital talent?\n\n3. How do we effectively fund digital initiatives?\n\n4. How do we drive digital initiatives to scale?\n\nThis is where the true value of Statoil sharing its path to digitisation becomes apparent. Larsen, Lancry, and Gul said they quickly realized those questions \u201ccentred on four building blocks\u201d.\n\n1. Where your business should be going (digital strategy);\n\n2. How that fits what your business does (business model);\n\n3. What you need to get there (enablers) and;\n\n4. How you will manage change to reach your destination (orchestration).\n\nThis then is how Equinor transformed itself into the digital business it is today.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
