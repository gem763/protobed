Conti's complaint, which describes how the son stole millions, gambled away their cash and spent time with prostitutes. Conti's patient is only identified as John Doe and the family's name and business are redacted in the court papers. But a New York Post reporter spotted billionaire Jay Schottenstein entering a Manhattan courtroom Monday for a closed-door hearing, according to the report.\n\nDoe is suffering from narcissistic personality disorder, which included borderline personality disorder and antisocial traits, according to court papers. His condition manifested itself in several ways including an addiction to Xanax, frequent cocaine use, thefts of money from his parents, multi-million dollar gambling losses and violent abusive and threatening behavior.\n\n\"As for Doe's family, the have exacerbated their son's problems because they have at all times refused to take effective action, despite entreaties by Dr. Conti to help stope their son's egregious threats,\" the court papers state.\n\nSchottenstein is a Columbus, Ohio-based philanthropist and head of DSW and American Eagle Outfitters, among other businesses.

Even though Conti says that Doe would not take responsibility for his behavior, he clearly lays that blame for Doe's behavior, in part, on his family.\n\n\"Doe would not cooperate with treatment and his parents consistently rewarded and enabled him regardless of how outrageous his conduct was,\" the lawsuit states.\n\n\"Your [s.i.c.] one big f------ fraud.

The family took no action after finding out, the lawsuit states.\n\n\"Doe's life is a tragedy, as is the damage he has inflicted upon his extraordinarily wealthy family,\" the lawsuit states. \"But neither his drug addiction, his severe psychiatric problems, nor his parents' wealth entitled him to inflict the damage he has caused Dr. Conti, or the damage he is likely to inflict in the future unless he is prevented from doing so.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nConti is seeking a minimum of $75,000 in damages, claiming he has suffered \u201csevere emotional distress\u201d as a result of the alleged harassment.
