(TSX VENTURE:BTRU) (FRANKFURT:5OGA) (the \"Company\" or \"betterU\") announced today it has filed its financial results for the year ended March 31, 2019 and the three months ended June 30, 2019. betterU is a Global Education Marketplace for emerging markets. The Company aggregates education, educational services and employment services from quality Institutions including universities, colleges, Industry leaders and corporations from around the world and makes their programs available to students through the betterU marketplace. betterU has now over 30,000 programs available.\n\n\n\nHighlights for the year ended March 31, 2019 and three months ended June 30, 2019 include:\n\n\u2022 For the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company reported revenues of $44,930, and a net loss of $8,239,114.\n\n\u2022 For the quarter ended June 30, 2019, the Company reported revenues of $198, and a net loss of $751,337.\n\n\u2022 On Jan. 17, 2019 Company provided following updates on its funding activities:\n\nThe Company has completed a $1,250,000 equity investment by HT Overseas Pte. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of HT Media Limited, (\u201cHT\u201d) for the purchase of 2,976,190 common shares of the Corporation at $0.42 per share (the \u201cPrivate Placement\u201d) with a hold period expiring on May 17, 2019. As previously announced on December 21, 2017, HT\u2019s $10 million investment is provided to betterU in eight (8) tranches over two years, this being the 3rd tranche with the full investment immediately being paid to HT\u2019s Media Groups by betterU to support betterU\u2019s mass marketing efforts across India.\n\nThe Company, over the last few months, has been working on multiple funding opportunities motivated by the ongoing delays from the $100M investment from TUC Co, Ltd. (\u201cTUC\u201d). These delays have not been explained in detail to betterU because according to GDS Holdings Ltd. (\u201cGDS\u201d), they are under confidentiality agreements with their investment partners. betterU has received over 400 emails over the last year with discussions not only with TUC and GDS, but also with other organizations that are also part of TUC\u2019s investment portfolio. betterU has been in active discussions with the CEOs for multiple groups in Canada and the USA with whom TUC and GDS have also promised funding. Despite the ongoing support and assurances made by TUC and GDS however, with these ongoing delays, it is not sustainable for betterU to rely solely on TUC or GDS, so betterU has had no choice but to seek other investment opportunities as outlined further below. betterU\u2019s agreement with TUC and GDS will remain active and when and if GDS funds are released they will be in accordance with the terms of the agreement executed by TUC and betterU on February 1, 2018.\n\nThe Term Sheet with AIP Asset Management Inc., AIP Inc. (\u201cAIP\u201d) for financing of $2.5 Million previously announced October 15, 2018, is currently under review by betterU. AIP requires as a condition to closing the financing that a subordination agreement (\u201cSA\u201d) be executed by the creditors of betterU. After betterU\u2019s creditors reviewed the SA provided by AIP, they felt it was punitive to their rights as creditors and decided not to sign it. betterU has been in discussions with AIP to determine alternative solutions and while AIP is willing to provide betterU with more time, at a cost, they still require that betterU\u2019s creditors execute on the SA. A further update to the market will be forthcoming as this materializes further.\n\nAdditionally, in early October 2018, betterU was invited to present to dozens of investors organized by a Montreal investor relations firm known to betterU, Mi3. During these events, betterU was introduced to the CEO of Quantiium Capital Management Corporation (\u201cQCMC\u201d) an alternative funding group located in Montreal QC who expressed interest in betterU. Over subsequent months, betterU met with their leadership teams in Montreal, Toronto and at betterU\u2019s office in Ottawa. Following QCMC\u2019s due diligence process, a Letter of Intent was offered and executed by both parties on December 5, 2018 which supports an investment of 5 Million Euro (approximately CND$7.5M) through a credit facility backed by QCMC. The agreements are currently under development with QCMC and the credit facility is expected to be issued in favour of betterU. Further details will be provided to the market as the agreements and timelines materialize.\n\nAll investments are subject to board of director and TSXV approvals. The Company wants to emphasize that they have no control over the timelines of these investments.\n\n\u2022 On Jan. 29, 2019, the Company announced that the successful acquisition of two corporate training contracts worth $26,812 with Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (Mahatransco), both located in Mumbai, India.

On October 15th, 2018, betterU entered into two loan agreements totaling $613,000 and entered into an agreement with AIP Asset Management Inc., (AIP) for an investment of $2.5 million to support ongoing operations and growth until the TUC funding is received. AIP and betterU are working through all the definitive agreements in connection with this funding.\n\n\u2022 On March 4, 2019, the Company announced a partnership with Pearson, a digital learning company.
