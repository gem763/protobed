So they go to wealthy people so they can have a holiday boat, only used for a couple of weeks a year,\" he said.\n\n\"This is gentrifying the canal and destroying our community.\"\n\nMatthew Symonds from the CRT said it had 34,200 boats on the waterways, and last year removed 17 houseboats because of licence issues.\n\nHe said enforced boat removal was a last resort after owners failed to meet guidelines for a licence and where they had not removed their boat themselves.", "description": "Steve and Sarah Holder live on the boat with their two children and say they will be left homeless.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8093/production/_108551923_mediaitem108551922.jpg"}
