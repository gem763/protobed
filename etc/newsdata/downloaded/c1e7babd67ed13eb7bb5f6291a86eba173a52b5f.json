The latest is Nomad, whose new Base Station Pro wireless charger promises to offer the kind of versatile charger that Apple couldn\u2019t.\n\nThe big promise of AirPower was a wireless charger that didn\u2019t need any exact placement \u2014 just drop up to three devices anywhere on the pad, and they would charge. That\u2019s exactly the thing that Nomad says its achieved with the Base Station Pro, which, instead of the usual three coils that you\u2019d typically see on a triple-device wireless charger, features an 18-coil matrix.\n\nTo pull this off, Nomad is partnering with Aira to license its FreePower wireless charging technology, which provides the single massive wireless charging service and the algorithms to figure out where the devices you\u2019re charging are.\n\nThe rest of the charger looks pretty similar to Nomad\u2019s other multiple-device wireless chargers, with a leather and aluminum design, although it thankfully has switched over to a 27W USB-C plug for charging instead of a proprietary barrel plug.\n\nThere are a few caveats: the Base Station Pro can only charge devices at up to 5W each, meaning that you won\u2019t get fast charging, even if your devices support it. There\u2019s also no word yet on price or an exact release date beyond a rough \u201cNovember\u201d date. Unlike AirPower, there\u2019s no Apple Watch support (since Apple still insists on a proprietary charging standard for its wearables). And we haven\u2019t yet been able to take the hardware for a spin ourselves, which means that we\u2019re largely taking Nomad at its word that it does what it says it can do.\n\nBut assuming the Base Station Pro actually works, it might just usher in a new era of wireless charging tech that\u2019s easier to use than ever before \u2014 a feat that not even Apple could pull off.", "description": "Apple\u2019s AirPower wireless charger was one of the company\u2019s most high-profile failures ever, but in the wake of its cancellation, plenty of companies have been trying to swoop in to fill the gap that Apple left.
