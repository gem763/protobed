He has been here several hours. But with every tick of the clock, the temperature rises. Mosquitoes hum a little louder, ants bite a bit harder and trickles of sweat become one continuous stream. Wriggling one arm free he picks up a walkie-talkie, a tool in case of emergency.\n\n\u201cI have a small problem,\u201d crackles his voice through the receiver. \u201cA bee has snuck through a rip in my trousers and stung me in a rather sensitive place.\u201d\n\nExhilarating and intrepid, the life of a BBC wildlife cameraman is rarely glamorous, and occasionally brushes with nature can be a little too close for comfort \u2013 and intimate in all the wrong ways.", "description": "", "authors": ["Sarah Marshall", "Will Greenwood"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/seven-worlds-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
