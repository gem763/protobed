REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nBA, owned by IAG (ICAG.L), said on Wednesday the six-per-week service would begin next April, in conjunction with a promotional British Airways Holidays offer.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s British arm entered liquidation after the group\u2019s collapse last month. Antalya and Dalaman in Turkey were Thomas Cook Airlines\u2019 most popular destinations for UK travellers, according to data from airline database Cirium.\n\nA company spokeswoman said that the route announcement had been a long time coming and was unconnected to Thomas Cook\u2019s failure. BA already operates a summer flight to Dalaman.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s bankruptcy, which triggered a major repatriation effort aided by BA, easyJet (EZJ.L) and Virgin Atlantic, has prompted airlines to consider ways to replace its capacity to holiday destinations or bid for its airport slots.\n\nBesides BA, operators that were already flying to the two Turkish destinations from London or Manchester before Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse include easyJet, Dart Group\u2019s Jet2, tour group TUI (TUIGn.DE), Turkish Airlines and its SunExpress joint venture with Lufthansa. (LHAG.DE)\n\nUnless Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal, HSBC analyst Andrew Lobbenberg predicted on Wednesday, \u201ceasyJet should benefit this winter from the failure of Thomas Cook\u201d.\n\nWithin days of its demise, easyJet began offering 15% discounts to Thomas Cook customers who had not yet left for their vacations and wanted to rebook.\n\nTurkey expects an increase in flights by easyJet and Jet2 as well as BA, the country\u2019s tourism minister has said. SunExpress laid on additional lower-fare flights from London Luton airport and has been targeting Thomas Cook customers left in the lurch, a spokesman said.\n\nEasyJet is also looking at Thomas Cook assets, Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said recently - while ruling out a bid for its German Condor business, being kept airborne by a government bridging loan.\n\nLeading European budget operator Ryanair (RYA.I) may lease Airbus (AIR.PA) aircraft returned by Thomas Cook and deploy them at its Austrian carrier Lauda, group CEO Michael O\u2019Leary said last week. He too denied any interest in Condor.\n\nA spokesman for the UK court-appointed official overseeing Thomas Cook\u2019s liquidation declined to comment on the status of bidding for its airport slots.", "description": "British Airways announced the launch of a new flight from London's Gatwick Airport to the Turkish resort of Antalya, once among Thomas Cook's most popular routes, as airlines jostle to fill the void left by its collapse.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438886022&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981HT", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
