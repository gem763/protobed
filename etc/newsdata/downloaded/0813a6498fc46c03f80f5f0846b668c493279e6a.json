We told them we\u2019re coming in. They said, \u2018Thank you for telling us.\u2019 They were very good,\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cThey did not know the mission but they knew we were going over an area where they had a lot of firepower.\u201d\n\nKey Democratic congressional leaders, however, were deliberately kept out of the loop.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he did not give many congressional leaders advance notice of the raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Saturday because he was afraid of \u201cleaks,\u201d he told reporters at a Sunday news conference. [\u2026] Trump said the members of Congress he informed ahead of the raid were North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, both Republicans. Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is on what is known as the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d for intelligence-related matters: Senate and House leaders from both parties and the chairman and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees. Trump said only \u201cvery few people\u201d were made aware of the raid, naming top officials in his administration and later Burr and Graham.\n\nTrump kept Lindsey Graham informed \u2013 the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman is not a member of the Gang of Eight, and there was no procedural reason to brief him in advance of highly sensitive intelligence \u2013 but he kept House leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff in the dark.\n\nIt\u2019s worth emphasizing that this isn\u2019t just a question of discourtesy. In our system of government, a president is not supposed to share intelligence secrets exclusively with members of one party.\n\nBy way of an explanation, the president, asked if he\u2019d informed the House Speaker, said, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t do \u2013 I didn\u2019t do that. I wanted to make sure this kept secret. I don\u2019t want to have men lost \u2013 and women. I don\u2019t want to have people lost.\u201d\n\nTrump added, \u201cWashington leaks like I\u2019ve never seen before. There\u2019s nothing \u2013 there\u2019s no country in the world that leaks like we do. And Washington is a leaking machine. And I told my people we will not notify them until the \u2013 our great people are out.\u201d\n\nThere are a few glaring problems with this.\n\nFirst, if the White House was determined to limit the number of lawmakers aware of the mission for security reasons, it doesn\u2019t explain why Republican members of Congress \u2013 including one GOP lawmaker outside the Gang of Eight \u2013 were notified and Democrats weren\u2019t. This was not supposed to be a partisan exercise.\n\nSecond, given the frequency with which Trump blurts out sensitive information \u2013 including, in one instance, his decision to leak highly classified intelligence with Russians for no reason \u2013 it was kind of hilarious to hear him whine yesterday about leaks, as if others have been careless.\n\nAnd third, as part of the same White House event in which he suggested Democrats might not be trustworthy to be discrete with sensitive intelligence, Donald Trump shared all kinds of operational details that he could\u2019ve easily kept to himself, including the precise number of commando helicopters used and the route they took to the raid.\n\nPolitico reported:\n\nThroughout the rest of the news conference, Trump eagerly divulged operational details that would normally be reserved for expert officials to share at their discretion. The move immediately drew criticism from national security analysts who said they were alarmed by the volume of information he shared regarding the location and specifics of the nighttime raid. Over the course of his remarks, Trump revealed that Baghdadi had been \u201cunder surveillance for a couple of weeks\u201d; the number of helicopters involved in the mission and their time of liftoff; how special forces teams managed to penetrate the compound where Baghdadi was found; how lab technicians administered a \u201cgenius\u201d DNA test after he killed himself by detonating a suicide vest; and which \u201celement of the attack [U.S. forces] were most afraid of.\u201d\n\nA separate Politico report added, \u201cTaken together, some of the details Trump revealed could help terrorist groups piece together new information about how U.S. counterterrorism forces gather intelligence and execute such dangerous missions, said veterans of previous operations.\u201d\n\nFor Trump to divulge these operational details was unsettling. For him to divulge these operational details while complaining about leaks and suggesting others lacked discretion was ridiculous.", "description": "For Trump to divulge operational details was unsettling.
