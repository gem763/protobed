There's a need to resolve this through sufficient dialogue between the two Koreas.\"Lee added that the Geumgang-san Mountain area has served as an inter-Korean cooperative project, as a rendezvous site for families separated by the Korean War as well as a place for social and cultural exchanges.Launched in 1998, the inter-Korean tour program to the mountain was suspended ten years later after a South Korean tourist was shot dead by a North Korean guard.The North has yet to respond to Seoul's proposal.Kim Ji-yeon, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
