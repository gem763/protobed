Getty\n\nThis growth has been driven by strong demand for land in areas with favourable growing seasons as farmers look to expand and, more recently, by a lack of properties on the market, particularly in drought-affected regions with overall rural property listings estimated to be down by more than 50 per cent on 2014 in many parts of the country.\n\n\u201cDemand for cropping land has been particularly intense over this period, which has accelerated the increase in cropping land prices, relative to other commodity sectors,\" said Rabobank agricultural analyst and author of its Overshot and Undershort Report, Wes Lefroy.", "description": "They have risen by a compound annual growth rate of 9.1 per cent over the past five years, leaving dairy and grazing land growth far behind, a Rabobank report shows.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2858%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_63%2C$y_300/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3eb9c2bf4e241dd86625a40b89b09182935fc3aa", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
