Show Hide Why are people protesting? The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement. Public anger \u2013 fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators \u2013 has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities. The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station \u2013 while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.\n\nProtesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill. Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill. Why were people so angry about the extradition bill? Beijing\u2019s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges. Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland. How have the authorities responded? Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets. Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are \u201cfanning the fire\u201d of unrest in the city. China\u2019s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to \u201cimmediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form\u201d. Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong\n\n\u201cHong Kong can serve as an example for the world to learn from,\u201d Wong told the audience at a press conference in Berlin. For too long, the 22-year-old said, authorities in the semi-autonomous region had been unaware of the ways in which the Chinese Communist party used trade to turn its \u201cone country, two systems\u201d motto into \u201cone country, one-and-a-half systems\u201d.\n\n\u201cChina uses the Belt and Road initiative as a way to increase and expand its economic influence and political gain \u2013 not just in Hong Kong, China, Asia Pacific, but also in Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nWong and fellow founders of the Demosisto political party had arrived in the German capital on Monday, where he was feted by politicians and media commentators at a party in the rooftop restaurant of the Reichstag building on Monday night hosted by the tabloid Bild.\n\nQuick guide What are the five demands of the Hong Kong protesters? Show Hide The complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, has said her government will formally withdraw the bill that ignited months of protests. Hong Kong residents had feared it could be used by China to extradite people for political reasons. They want guarantees that it cannot be reintroduced at a later date. Withdrawal of the use of the word 'riot' in relation to the protests Protesters want the government to officially recognise that their movement has been a series of legitimate protests, rather than a riot, as has been stated in official communications. Unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them dropped Hundreds of people have been arrested in recent weeks, and the protesters are demanding that all of them be freed, and that no convictions should stand against any of them. An independent inquiry into police behaviour Police use of force has escalated since the demonstrations began, while protesters have also resorted to increasingly violent measures. Demonstrators say an inquiry into police brutality is the number-one priority. Implementation of genuine universal suffrage Hong Kong's chief executive is currently selected by a 1,200-member committee, and nearly half of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by limited electorates representing different sectors of the economy. The protesters want to be able to vote for their leaders in free and open democratic elections. Photograph: Anushree Fadnavis/X06783\n\nA meeting with the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas \u2013 photos of which Wong tweeted from his official account \u2013 drew anger from the Chinese government, which said the encounter was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d of Beijing\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nWong was charged last month with inciting people to join a protest in June, and is out on bail. He was sentenced to two months in prison in May on a contempt charge after pleading guilty to obstructing the clearance of a major protest camp in 2014.\n\nSpeaking to German media on Wednesday, he said: \u201cThe air of freedom I breathe here, instead of the irritative smell of teargas, reminds me how important it is for me to share the thoughts of people who attend the protests in Hong Kong right now.\u201d\n\nA meeting with the chancellor, Angela Merkel, who was on a state visit to China last week, did not materialise during his trip, and Wong appeared reluctant to comment on attempts to contact the German leader. His global tour, he said, was focused on meeting with lawmakers to build up bipartisan support for his cause.\n\nQuick guide Democracy under fire in Hong Kong since 1997 Show Hide Hong Kong\u2019s democratic struggles since 1997 1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill.

Three decades ago, the Berlin Wall fell, and we hope that in the future, the great firewall of China will also fall.\u201d", "description": "Joshua Wong urges Berlin to halt export of equipment such as water cannon used against protesters", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cba505bb9e485c890a648f6128878899be718780/0_265_4333_2600/master/4333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2a3288b4019c134b23e285f9acef7b27", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
