This one has has that potential.\n\nMike Ashley\u2019s retail empire has a problem. With auditor Grant Thornton having quit, the company needs a replacement. It hasn\u2019t been able to find one.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOne of the big four (PwC, EY, Deloitte, KPMG) would be the preferred candidate because of the expertise they have dealing with big and complex organisations.\n\nTrouble is they\u2019ve been fighting shy of the tender.\n\nMPs, regulators, and the press have been putting them under the microscope and asking uncomfortable questions in the wake of several messy scandals, such why didn\u2019t your audit team raise the alarm bells when half the City knew (insert name) was screwed.\n\nAshley has been a magnet for controversy ever since Sports Direct landed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nAs a result, his company appears to have been filed under the heading \u201creputational risk\u201d.\n\nNow, if the company doesn't pull a rabbit out of the hat, it will have a week to write to Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom, who\u2019ll get landed with the job of making an appointment.\n\nThis is really too precious. If you want to find a less sympathetic character than Ashley, Leadsom is it.\n\nSay what you want about the Sports Direct boss, but he\u2019s never been complicit in the deliberate suspension of democracy through proroguing Parliament after having publicly stated opposition to such an outragesou move. That's not true of the Secretary of State for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS).\n\nIf this does get to her desk, it will hand Boris Johnson\u2019s government yet another painful headache, one of those famous \u201cevents, dear boy\u201d that Harold Macmillan, a much less obnoxious Conservative leader of a much less obnoxious Conservative Government, once opined upon.\n\nPerversely, however, this is one that could ultimately work out well for Sports Direct\u2019s beleaguered band of independent shareholders, who are in a minority at the company thanks to Ashley\u2019s controlling stake.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

BEIS therefore has some leverage that could be used to lean upon one of them to take on the job, with the obvious implication that it will be made worth the (un)lucky winning candidate\u2019s while in future.\n\nAuditors are usually appointed and paid for by the companies they audit. This obviously creates a potential conflict of interest.\n\nBut in Sports Direct\u2019s case, the auditor will have been appointed by the government and with all eyes on the poor schmos handed the responsibility, they clearly be motivated to do an unusually thorough job.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Sports Direct\u2019s independent shareholders will be the winners from that. If that's how it goes, some bright spark might then suggest that all big company auditors should be appointed by an independent body. But that's one to file away for another day.\n\nIn the meantime, keep an eye on the number of votes against Ashley\u2019s reappointment as CEO. He can\u2019t be kicked out because of that controlling stake. But if a majority of independent shareholders vote against him it will be horribly embarrassing.", "description": "Buckle up for the Sports Direct AGM.\u00a0 While these affairs aren\u2019t usually terribly exciting, when they blow up, they blow up big.
