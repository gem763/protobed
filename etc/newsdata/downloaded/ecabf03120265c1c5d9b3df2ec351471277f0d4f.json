This was slightly higher than economists\u2019 median expectation of 4.2% y-o-y. Nonetheless, this was the eight straight month that inflation was near the 4.5% y-o-y level currently favoured by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). The central bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is currently busy with a bi-monthly meeting to consider inflation and other economic data in determining interest rates.\n\nThe major drivers behind the rise in headline inflation during August were higher price pressures on food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing and utilities, transport, and recreation and culture. Food price inflation increased from 3.0% y-o-y in July to 3.8% y-o-y in August \u2013 the highest reading since February 2018. There was a broad increase in the inflation on different food items. However, a large component of this was due to base effects on the consumer price index (CPI) created by food price disinflation during the first half of 2018.\n\nPublic transport inflation increased from 7.6% y-o-y in July to 9.0% y-o-y in August. Many minibus taxi operators made annual adjustments to their fares during August. The fare adjustment in August led to sporadic protest action. On a positive note, some elements within the taxi industry is looking to the use of compressed (CNG) or Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) as alternative fuels to make taxi fares more affordable. There are already 1,200 taxis in the country running on gas after being converted from petrol.\n\nSouth African Inflation & Interest Rates\n\nThe MPC will welcome another inflation reading near its 4.5% y-o-y target. However, the central bank has warned before that it expects inflation to accelerate during late-2019 and the first half of 2020. This trend is unlikely to change much when the MPC releases its revised inflation projections on September 19. As such, the central bank is unlikely to risk cutting interest rates this month. Policymakers will also reiterate that easier monetary policy is not a panacea for the country\u2019s low economic growth trajectory. PwC also believes that the SARB will look to interest rate differentials with other major central banks \u2013 and the need to maintain a sizeable spread - during a period of Fiscal strain and increased Government borrowing.
