The National Hurricane Center said the storm was driving sustained winds of 185 mph, with gusts exceeding 220 mph. Dorian's slow crawl, estimated at about 5 mph on Sunday afternoon, placed it within 175 miles of West Palm Beach, Florida. Millions of people from South Florida to North Carolina were on alert and preparing for the worst. Even if Dorian does not make landfall in Florida, the effects will be felt beginning around Monday evening when Florida's Melbourne and Palm Bay areas can expect tropical storm winds, said Ed Rappaport, deputy director at the National Hurricane Center.\n\nStay updated on Hurricane Dorian: Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\nOsaka and Nadal are top draws for U.S. Open\n\nIt sure will be difficult to match the emotional aftermath of her previous match.
