In the earlier attack he had suffered a cracked rib and collapsed lung.\n\nMs Davis has a cast on her right ankle and received stitches for the wound in her left thigh. She was released from hospital on Monday.\n\nThe attack happened on an established trail in Antelope Island State Park.\n\nWitnesses reported seeing a bison strike Ms Davis with its head, \"lifting her off the ground\".\n\nThe 22-year-old was airlifted to hospital in Ogden, Utah.\n\nMs Davis told the BBC she had run ahead of Mr Bourgeous on the trail when she saw the bison. She passed it once, before deciding to turn around and rejoin Mr Bourgeous.\n\n\"I wasn't comfortable standing at the mile marker waiting for him, and I didn't know how comfortable he would be seeing [the bison] too, so I turned back and passed the bison again, giving it as much space as possible.\"\n\nBut when she was on her way back, four cyclists happened to come down the trail and \"spooked\" it.\n\nThe bison charged her and she began running away.\n\n\"I looked over my shoulder, seeing it get closer - and I looked again and it was pretty much right behind me. Right as I saw it, I flew up in the air 15ft (4.5m),\" Ms Davis says.\n\nShe landed on her back and lay completely still - remembering what happened to Mr Bourgeous - as the bison sniffed at her.\n\nEventually, it wandered far enough away for Mr Bourgeous and the other witnesses on the trail to help her.\n\nIn hospital, she learned that that the bison's horn had gone through her ankle.\n\nImage copyright GoFundMe/Kyler Bourgeous Image caption Kyler Bourgeous was gored by a bison in June\n\nMr Bourgeous, 30, faced a similar situation when he was gored, months earlier. He had reached the summit of the park's highest point - a familiar trail for him - when he saw two bison as he came over the ridge.\n\n\"I couldn't see them until I was too close to them,\" Mr Bourgeous told the BBC. \"I turned around immediately and only got a few steps away before one of them charged me.\"\n\nThe bison's horns gored his hip and armpit, fracturing a rib which then collapsed his lung. The animal then trampled him and kicked his head.\n\nMr Bourgeous had to use a drain in his hip for several weeks because the goring had left an internal hole. He says his ribs still hurt when he coughs, but he has mostly recovered.\n\nHe says there is \"something special\" about the beauty of Antelope Island park, where he has been hiking since his childhood, but that the sight of bison now makes him anxious.\n\n\"My fear level is high enough that I don't know when I'll end up on a trail out there,\" Mr Bourgeous says.\n\nMs Davis also says she has been having nightmares about the attack in the days since, but otherwise feels \"pretty happy and positive\" and wants to get outside again soon.\n\nShe adds that she has talked with a park ranger about possibly volunteering at the visitors centre, but \"it might take a minute\" before she's fully ready for that.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bison charges at nine-year-old girl at Yellowstone National Park\n\nAs for their next venture outdoors together?\n\n\"Not Yellowstone!\" Mr Bourgeous answers with a laugh.", "description": "He hoped to watch the sunset with his date... so he took her to the same place he'd been gored.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3448/production/_109048331_tv055472731.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
