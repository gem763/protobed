How about Spencer Dinwiddie\u2019s instead?\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets point guard is reportedly planning to sell digital tokens tied to his $34 million contract extension, or at least part of it. The Athletic was first to report on Dinwiddie\u2019s plans.\n\nThe move would raise a pile of cash that Dinwiddie would be able to invest up front, rather than waiting to be paid his salary over the next three years. If his investments work out, he could end up with income streams lasting well beyond 2022.\n\nInvestors in Dinwiddie\u2019s offering would be paid principal and interest, according to the report.\n\nDinwiddie, who describes himself on Twitter as \u201ca tech guy with a jumper,\u201d has expressed interest in cryptocurrencies before. He tweeted the symbol for Bitcoin Thursday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t be the first professional athlete to let investors buy into his brand. A San Francisco-based company called Fantex offered what it calls \u201cathlete tracking stocks\u201d tied to NFL players including Vernon Davis, Mohamed Sanu, Alshon Jeffery and Michael Brockers.

So he wouldn\u2019t be relying on the same revenue streams as Fantex.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Thinking of investing in your future?
