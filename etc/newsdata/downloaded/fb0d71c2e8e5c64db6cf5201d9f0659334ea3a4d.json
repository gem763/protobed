The CEO testified Tuesday before a Senate committee about the Max, which has been banned from flying since March.\n\n\u201cWe now know of at least one case where a Boeing manager implored the then-vice president and general manager of the 737 program to shut down the 737 Max production line because of safety concerns, several months before the Lion Air crash in October 2018,\u201d DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat, said in his prepared opening statement, which was released by the committee.\n\nDeFazio\u2019s accusations pile pressure on Muilenburg as the embattled CEO prepares for a second day of grilling on Capitol Hill. Muilenburg is fighting to save his job amid heightened scrutiny from Boeing directors. He\u2019s also trying to salvage the U.S. industrial titan\u2019s reputation following months of bruising disclosures about shortcomings in the design and certification of the Max, Boeing\u2019s best-selling jet. The crashes killed 346 people.\n\nEven as senators peppered Muilenburg with blistering questions, Boeing rose as investors seemed convinced that the testimony wouldn\u2019t impede the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s review of whether the grounded Max can safely resume commercial flight after a redesign of flight-control software. The shares advanced 2.4% to $348.93 at the close in New York, the third-best performance on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nSafety Cost\n\nDeFazio didn\u2019t detail the nature of the safety concerns raised by the Boeing manager or how the company responded. The Chicago-based planemaker didn\u2019t immediately comment.\n\nAt least one whistle-blower also told the committee that the company sacrificed safety for cost savings, DeFazio wrote. Boeing also considered adding a more robust alerting system for the feature involved in two crashes before ultimately shelving the idea, according to DeFazio.\n\n\u201cWe may never know what key steps could have been taken that would have altered the fate of those flights, but we do know that a variety of decisions could have made those planes safer and perhaps saved the lives of those on board,\u201d DeFazio said.\n\nThe statement by DeFazio is the first detailed look at findings by the committee, which is conducting what the chairman called the \u201cmost extensive and important\u201d investigation he\u2019s seen during his time on the panel.\n\nSome of the statement was crafted as questions for Muilenburg.\n\n\u201cThere are areas we are exploring that remain murky, and we need to bring clarity to those issues,\u201d DeFazio said. \u201cBut there is a lot we have learned over the past seven months, and we expect you to answer a number of questions to improve our understanding of what happened and why.\u201d\n\nSenate Hearing\n\nAbout 20 relatives of crash victims attended Tuesday\u2019s Senate hearing, and Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker opened the session by promising them that the inquiry would get to the bottom of what went wrong.\n\n\u201cBoth of these accidents were entirely avoidable,\u201d Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, said as he gaveled the hearing to order. \u201cWe cannot fathom the pain experienced by the families of those 346 souls who were lost.\u201d\n\nA flight-safety feature known as Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, designed to lower the nose of the plane in some conditions, was activated in both fatal crashes as a result of a malfunction and pilots in both cases didn\u2019t respond and lost control. The plane was grounded by the FAA on March 13.\n\nMuilenburg apologized directly to the family members of victims who died in the crashes -- many of whom had brought large photos of their loved ones -- and said the company was committed to safety and to learning from the accidents.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been challenged and changed by these accidents. We\u2019ve made mistakes and we got some things wrong,\u201d Muilenburg said.\n\nThe CEO sometimes fumbled his explanations of embarrassing internal messages and the manufacturer\u2019s close ties to U.S. regulators. And he didn\u2019t rattle off changes made to improve safety with the aplomb and detail with which General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra once addressed faulty ignition issues before lawmakers, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A Boeing Co. manager sought to halt production of the 737 Max over safety concerns before the first of two fatal crashes that led to the jet\u2019s worldwide grounding, a top House lawmaker charged Tuesday.Representative Peter DeFazio, the chairman of the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee", "authors": ["Alan Levin", "Ryan Beene", "Julie Johnsson", "Courtney Rozen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6lchHXy_0OASQjBl6SQXWg--~B/aD0xMTQ4O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/9edd2025e89970b49e052ab512d23d82", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
