We have a stacked night of boxing ahead of us, topped by Regis Prograis and Josh Taylor in the World Boxing Super Series. Before then, Dereck Chisora fights David Price in a clash between British heavyweight favourites. Stay tuned for all the night's action. Tonight's card looks something like this: Prograis vs Taylor (WBSS final, WBA and IBF super-lightweight titles) Chisora vs Price Ricky Burns vs Lee Selby Yves Ngabu vs Lawrence Okolie (cruiserweight European title) Conor Benn vs Steve Jamoye So strap in and enjoy, we'll have full coverage of each bout live from ringside! OK, I've arrived and I'm at the O2! While we wait for Benn to fight, have a read of Jack Rathborn's exclusive interview with him. Conor Benn: \u2018Britain is in for one hell of a treat\u2019 We just witnessed Shannon Courtenay beat Melinda Habran in a fight that was perhaps trickier than she'd have hoped. Up next, Conor Benn. Advertisement Conor Benn wins by knockout! The 23-year-old lands a devastating left to the head which knocks Jamoye out and he stays down. He's treated by doctors and rises to his feet - thankfully. Up next, Lawrence Okolie challenges Yves Ngabu for the European cruiserweight belt. This presents a massive step up in competition for Okolie, who is making his way through the ranks at a steady pace.\n\nHe makes ring walk right now. And here comes Ngabu! Walking out to \u201cI got five on it\u201d, banger to be fair. Advertisement Introductions done! Round by round updates to follow. Round one: Ngabu 9-10 Okolie Okolie has clearly been working on his inside game and it\u2019s showing, he\u2019s working the body plenty and isn\u2019t looking as awkward as he usually does when the fight isn\u2019t at range. Every punch he throws is hurting his opponent and he\u2019s using his footwork well to get out of any situations where he\u2019s too close. A good opening round for the Brit. The arena is really starting to fill up, by the way. It will be close to completely packed out by the main event. Round two: Ngabu 18-20 Okolie Ngabu did well to tie Okolie up in that round and make it an awkward one, but he\u2019s not really throwing anything back. Ngabu\u2019s nose is bloodied and he\u2019s just being outworked at the moment. Not too much action in the second there. Advertisement Round three: Ngabu 27-30 Okolie Okolie landed a few good straight rights in the third but the fight is just being contested at no distance and as usual with his fights, it makes for ugly viewing. He does hit so, so hard though and it\u2019ll be wearing down the body of Ngabu. Round four: Ngabu 36-40 Okolie Really bad round for spectators, Okolie just isn\u2019t keeping his distance so is being smothered. He\u2019s landing the odd jab and it\u2019s keeping him winning the rounds but it\u2019s not enjoyable to watch. Especially when Ngabu isn\u2019t actually throwing anything back... Round five: Ngabu 45-50 Okolie Better! Okolie steps back and lands a right hook which hurts Ngabu, but the European champion smothers him again. It would be a good tactic if he actually wanted to get involved with the throwing of punches. Okolie throws a left hand followed by a right and the blood from Ngabu\u2019s nose splatters all over the ring. Round six: Ngabu 55-60 Okolie Was there a punch landed in that round? If there was, I didn\u2019t see it. Can only give that one a draw - because why not make it interesting? Advertisement It\u2019s all over!\n\nLawrence Okolie wins the European cruiserweight belt! The fight suddenly comes to life as Okolie lands a good and telling combination to the head and Ngabu is shaken badly on his feet, he falls into the ropes and the referee saves him. It all started with a wonderfully timed right hand to the chin. A horrible fight to watch but Okolie is now the European champion. Okolie speaking after the fight: \u201dI feel good, I knew he\u2019d clinch on the inside. He was definitely tough, every fight I\u2019ve had has either been a 50/50 or they\u2019ve been champions. I\u2019m learning and progressing.\u201d Lawrence Okolie moves to 14-0 and is picking up all the belts as he goes along.
