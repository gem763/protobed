Nonetheless, RT\u2019s video agency Ruptly managed to snap a rare shot at a highway between northern Syrian towns of Tabaqqa and Kobani.\n\nThe short clip from the scene shows a US military convoy of several armored vehicles leaving the border town of Kobani. A Syrian military unit, transported on apparently less fancy vehicles, is seen heading towards the town.\n\nSyrian Army meet US troops on a highway as American forces move out from Kobani.

The withdrawal has been sped up by the Turkish-led military operation against the Kurdish militia, one-time ally of the US, that incidentally heads the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) controlling around one-third of Syria\u2019s territory. Washington used the SDF as a ground force in the fight against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS).\n\nAlso on rt.com Syrian Army deployed to country\u2019s northeast to counter \u2018Turkish aggression\u2019 (VIDEOS)\n\nAnkara regards Kurdish militia groups as terrorists over links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which has been waging insurgency in Turkey\u2019s southeast for decades, ultimately seeking secession from the country. However, the Turkish incursion into Syria, which aims to establish a 30-km wide \u201csafe zone\u201d and plant previously displaced refugees and Ankara-backed Islamist rebel groups there, was not met with open arms by Damascus.\n\nAfter apparently striking a deal with the Kurds, the Syrian Army said it was moving in to secure the strategic border area and entered the towns of Qamishli and Manbij. Kobani, once famously besieged by ISIS, is likely to become a hotspot of conflict again due to its position right on the Syrian-Turkish border.\n\nMoscow on Monday said it never approved of the occupation of Kobani in security discussions with Ankara, with the Defense Ministry dismissing reports that such a question was ever brought up.\n\nLike this story?
