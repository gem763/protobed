The material is thin and somewhat stretchy, and they are very comfortable,\u201d says a reviewer. This reviewer agrees, writing, \u201cThe feel of the fabric is incredible.\u201d Customers like that they are lightweight but durable, as this reviewer notes: \u201cThey are super soft and nice and lightweight. But they are also hardy. I\u2019ve basically been wearing these daily for the last week and thrown in the wash several times since then and there\u2019s been no shrinking or fading or threading. They\u2019re holding up splendidly.\u201d They don\u2019t seem to shrink, either: \u201cI am obsessed with these pants. They are so comfortable I put them on every night after work. The biggest selling point, they didn\u2019t shrink when I washed them.\u201d Reviewers also like the prints the pants come in: \u201cThese pants are absolutely amazing; they are SO ridiculously soft and comfy, and the print is very pretty, too.\u201d This reviewer even considers wearing them outside of the house: \u201cI know they\u2019re intended to be more of a lounge pant, but the print is so beautiful I think I want to dress them up.\u201d Some reviewers say that the pants also make their butts look good: \u201cBONUS: they definitely hug my curves and make my butt look AMAZING.\u201d Says another, \u201cThey do make the booty look good. I have received so many compliments for them, and have had others ask where I got them.\u201d", "description": "We found the best women\u2019s pajamas on Amazon, including cotton jersey pajama sets, flannel pajama sets and pajama pants, cotton loungewear sets, satin pajama sets, nightgowns, onesie pajamas, and footie pajamas.", "authors": ["The Editors"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2018/11/09/pj/09-womens-pjs.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
