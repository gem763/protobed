Fitful progress coexists with a simmering backlash and the stubborn inertia of institutions that have built their legacies on resisting change. Harvey Weinstein and Les Moonves are gone, but before the systemic reckoning with gender discrimination and sexual predation was even fully underway, there was widespread hand-wringing about how it had gone too far.\n\nFilmmakers like Ryan Coogler, Ava DuVernay, Barry Jenkins and Greta Gerwig have pushed through doors and held them open. But the gatekeepers are still mostly white men, and the default setting for Hollywood remains what it has been for a long time. Statistics compiled for 2018 by Women and Hollywood show progress that might charitably be called glacial. Four of the Top 100 films that year had a credited female director. African-Americans directed 16 of those \u2014 double the number in the previous year. Four had Asian-American directors, all of them male.\n\nThe numbers may continue to improve \u2014 the success of Lulu Wang\u2019s \u201cThe Farewell\u201d will surely change that last statistic \u2014 but there is a tradition in Hollywood of treating inclusion as a momentary concern. In July, our colleague Reggie Ugwu wrote a haunting story about black directors in the 1990s whose careers began in a similar moment of apparent change, only to languish and sputter in ways that will be familiar to women as well. Racism and sexism are tenacious forces, in Hollywood and elsewhere. SCOTT\n\nGood: There are encouraging signs of change\n\nYes, women and minority men remain wildly underrepresented in the industry, and most movies are directed by white men. But there has been a slight uptick in black male directors, and if you look beyond the 2018 Top 100 \u2014 and the big studios \u2014 you find critical and commercial successes hits like the documentary \u201cRBG,\u201d by Betsy West and Julie Cohen, and other female-centric movies that deserved more attention and viewers, like Karyn Kusama\u2019s thriller \u201cDestroyer.\u201d\n\nThis may be cold comfort, but a lot of women are making good and great work that will outlast some of the dreck directed by their higher-paid, less-talented male colleagues. The other good news is that while real change is exasperatingly slow \u2014 it seems obvious that meaningful change will happen only through lawsuits or when a lot of bosses die or retire \u2014 people are now at least paying attention. The issue isn\u2019t going away. We aren\u2019t going away.
