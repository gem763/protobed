So is Ryan Zimmerman.\n\nThe Washington Nationals would not be headed to a win-or-go-home Game 5 in their NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers without them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a bunch of yahoos. We\u2019re old guys,\u201d Scherzer joked. \u201cOld guys can still do it.\u201d\n\nSure can. And for a guy whose teams used to lose repeatedly in the postseason, Scherzer sure is delivering now.\n\nEvery time he\u2019s pitched this October, the Nationals have won. His latest outing was a season-saving, seven-inning masterpiece that combined with Zimmerman\u2019s three-run parabola of a homer to lift the wild-card Nationals to a 6-1 victory over league-best Los Angeles on Monday night, tying the best-of-five NLDS at two games apiece.\n\n\u201cI was just gassed. I was out,\u201d said Scherzer, who threw 109 pitches. \u201cI was empty in the tank.\u201d\n\nScowling and muttering to himself as showers fell for part of his gritty performance, Scherzer allowed one run and four hits while striking out nine - and, most importantly for Washington, he prevented LA from closing out the NLDS after taking a 2-1 lead into Game 4.\n\n\u201cHe really gave it all he had,\u201d said Anthony Rendon, who drove in three runs for Washington.\n\nWith fans who braved rain chanting, \u201cBeat LA!\u201d in the late going, Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson combined to get the last six outs for Washington, which will send Stephen Strasburg to the mound against Walker Buehler on Wednesday night at Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIf I could bet, I\u2019d bet on him,\u201d Nationals outfielder Adam Eaton said about Strasburg. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good pitcher. A polished pitcher. To have him healthy and ready to go in that situation only boosts our confidence.\u201d\n\nWhichever team advances to the NL Championship Series will face the Braves or Cardinals next. Their NLDS heads to a Game 5 at Atlanta on Wednesday.\n\nZimmerman showed what he still can do at the plate by taking a 97 mph pitch, the second thrown by reliever Pedro B\u00e1ez, and turning it into a high-arching 400-foot-plus rainbow that descended onto the green batter\u2019s eye in straightaway center field for a three-run shot that made it 5-1.\n\n\u201cZim put a really good swing on it,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.\n\nThat was after Julio Ur\u00edas, LA\u2019s third pitcher and the one charged with the loss, began the fifth by serving up a line-drive single to Trea Turner, who finished with three hits. Rendon, who led the majors with 126 RBIs during the regular season but entered Monday with just one in the playoffs, delivered a run-scoring single that made it 2-1.\n\nRendon also brought home runs via sacrifice flies in the third and sixth.\n\nThat was plenty for Scherzer, who clenched his teeth while getting through his last inning after loading the bases by issuing a pair of walks with one out in the seventh. But he got out of that by striking out pinch-hitter Chris Taylor and getting Joc Pederson - whose liner on a first-pitch cut landed about an inch foul - to ground out.\n\nScherzer shook his arms and yelled as he stalked to the home dugout.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say enough about his compete,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cHe just sort of wills his way to getting outs.\u201d\n\nThe Dodgers\u2019 lone run came when Justin Turner connected for a no-doubt-about-it homer to left on Scherzer\u2019s 10th pitch, a 95 mph fastball. But from there, facing an LA lineup stacked with a half-dozen lefty hitters, Scherzer displayed the sort of ornery dominance that helped him win three Cy Young Awards.\n\n\u201cHe might look like a maniac out there,\u201d catcher Kurt Suzuki said, \u201cbut he\u2019s smart.\u201d\n\nScherzer entered these playoffs on a skid: His teams, Detroit and Washington, had been 0-7 in his most recent seven postseason appearances. But the Nationals won the NL wild-card game last week, which he started; Game 2 of the NLDS, when Scherzer struck out all three batters he faced in relief of Strasburg; and now Game 4.\n\nScherzer said a Game 5 appearance was out of the question.\n\n\u201cThat pushed me all the way to the edge and then some,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, yeah, I can\u2019t imagine any scenario where I\u2019m pitching.\u201d\n\nLA\u2019s own three-time Cy guy, Clayton Kershaw, will be available to follow Buehler, Roberts said.\n\nThe Dodgers are trying to get to the NLCS for the fourth year in a row, while the Nationals have never been to that round since moving from Montreal in 2005. Washington will be playing in its fourth NLDS Game 5 in the past eight years; the Nats are 0-3 so far, with all those losses at home, including against the Dodgers in 2016.\n\nZimmerman for so many years was the face of the franchise for the Nationals, who made him their first draft pick 14 years ago. So he\u2019s been through all their highs, including four NL East titles, and lows, including early exit after early exit in the playoffs. He no longer is an everyday player - Game 4 marked his second start of this postseason - and his teammate-mandated dugout dance after his homer consisted of pretending to use a walker.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been here forever,\u201d Rendon said. \u201cMan, he means everything to this city, to this team.\u201d\n\nThis could be a last hurrah for Zimmerman with the Nationals, who hold an $18 million contract option on him in 2020. He insists he\u2019s not thinking about the future, other than figuring that he\u2019ll continue playing beyond this season.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of people,\u201d Zimmerman said, \u201cthat think these are my last games.\u201d\n\nThat prompted Scherzer to pipe up.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think,\u201d Scherzer said, \u201cthese are his last games.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nNationals: CF Victor Robles was out of the starting lineup for the second game in a row after straining his right hamstring in Game 2.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Game 5 starting pitchers both already have shown what they can do in this series. Buehler allowed just one hit in six innings and got the win in LA\u2019s 6-0 victory at home in Game 1 last Thursday. Strasburg started Game 2 a night later, a 4-2 Washington victory, and took a perfect game into the fifth inning while outdueling Kershaw. Strasburg struck out 10 and gave up just one run in six innings, leaving his career postseason ERA at 0.64 - the best in history for pitchers with at least four starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Max Scherzer is 35.
