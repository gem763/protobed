Bulls can only hope that this is a shakeout. Trading back above red would make me more confident that it is. Jfc, this looks terrible,\u201d he explained in a recent tweet.\n\n$LTC Anything below red looks like death.\n\nBulls can only hope that this is a shakeout.\n\nTrading back above red would make me more confident that it is.

Is a big timeframe head and shoulders. The positive news (Halving) completely irrelevant and dumped into. Many reasons why this looks like shit, let\u2019s hope it makes its way back above the red line,\u201d he replied.\n\nBroke the only significant support left.\n\nIs a big timeframe head and shoulders.\n\nThe positive news (Halving) completely irrelevant and dumped into.
