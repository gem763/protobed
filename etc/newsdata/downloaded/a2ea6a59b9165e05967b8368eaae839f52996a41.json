This category doesn't just include spiders and humans, but whales, too.\n\nScientists have captured incredible new footage of one of the most dramatic examples of this hunting strategy off the coast of Southeast Alaska, where humpback whales fashion \"nets\" made of bubbles to catch fish and krill.\n\nMarine mammal researchers at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa set out to record the humpbacks from two angles in order to witness minute details about their use of bubble-nets. Footage shot from the perspective of the whales was obtained by cameras and sensors attached to the humpbacks with suction cups, according to a news release, while aerial footage of the bubble formations at the surface was filmed by drones.\n\n\u201cThe footage is rather groundbreaking,\u201d said Lars Bejder, director of the Marine Mammal Research Program at UH-M\u0101noa, in a video about the research. \u201cOverlaying these two data sets is quite exciting.\u201d\n\nThe team, which included scientists from Stanford University and UC-Santa Cruz, filmed the cooperative effort of the whales to create the nets.\n\nThe maneuver typically begins with the whales gathering beneath the shoal of prey and producing bubbles from their blowholes. As they ascend in a spiral formation, they work as a group to blow bubbles in a pattern that forms a kind of shrinking vortex around the shoal, which forces the prey toward the surface.\n\nScientists think that the calls of the whales might create an acoustic \u201cwall of sound\u201d that intimidates the prey into remaining inside the bubble-net. By the time they approach the surface, the whales have served up a concentrated amount of fish and krill inside the torrent of bubbles, and all they have to do is gulp them down.\n\nThe new video includes an animation that illustrates these vertical strands of air bubbles humpbacks create to effectively corral prey in a tight space.\n\nAnimation of humpbacks forming bubble nets.

In addition to helping scientists understand whale behavior, this hunting strategy can also offer clues about the animals\u2019 response to their habitat, which is rapidly shifting due to climate change and prey depletion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re observing how these animals are manipulating their prey and preparing the prey for capture,\u201d Bejder said. \u201cIt is allowing us to gain new insights that we really haven\u2019t been able to do before.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re observing how these animals are manipulating their prey and preparing the prey for capture.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da5f150b4f1b8000961f439/lede/1571156304893-fsdfsdfsdf.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
