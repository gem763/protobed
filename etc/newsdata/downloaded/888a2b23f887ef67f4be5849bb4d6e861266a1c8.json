Morey\u2019s sin was sharing an image of a slogan that read, \u201cFight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d Even though the GM, regrettably, deleted his tweet, one strongly suspects his grasp of China\u2014 where the state is running \u201cre-education\u201d camps filled with Uyghurs\u2014is considerably stronger than any of the NBA\u2019s leading apologists.\n\nOnly last year, James, a purported champion of social justice, came out in support of former quarterback Colin Kaepernick with the vacuous platitude, \u201cI stand with anyone who believes in change.\u201d Anyone? Of course, LeBron\u2019s stand, as with most acts of pretend celebrity bravery, resulted in hosannas being thrown at him by the press, and, more importantly, never costing him a penny.\n\nAmericans tend to use word like \u201cstand\u201d and \u201cfight\u201d in their political disagreements, although they never really have to stand and fight for anything. Tank Man stood and fought. The Hong Kong protesters stand and fight. We take to social media and argue. Posting a Nike-approved picture on your Instagram account of Kaepernick\u2014adorned with the $40-million market-test slogan, \u201cBelieve in something, Even if it means sacrificing everything\u201d\u2014is not an act of bravery, LeBron.\n\nAnd that\u2019s fine. All of this just speaks to the relative safety afforded dissent and protest in our political life. In the United States celebrities are free to accuse the president of being a fascist dictator or \u201cbum,\u201d and no one is coming to knock on their doors. Watching fabulously wealthy men fretting over their words abroad is a useful reminder of the liberalism we have inherited.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with playing NBA games in China. The Chinese people are the victims of their system, after all, and the more connection they have to the rest of the world the better. There isn\u2019t really even any pressing demand for professional athletes to speak out on geopolitical issues. Once the Hong Kong question was exposed, though, it was deeply revolting to watch those who benefit most in a meritocratic society acquiescing to the illiberal diktats of a foreign regime.\n\nIt\u2019s especially galling to listen to those who peddle hysteria about contemporary American politics pandering to the Chinese commissars. Apparently, those most prone to calling out pretend Hitlers can\u2019t get themselves to say a negative word about real-world Hitlers.\n\nTake Warriors coach Steve Kerr, a constant social media commentator, with opinions on seemingly every contemporary political issue. First, Kerr deflected questions about the totalitarian Chinese state by risibly claiming he needed to confer with his brother-in-law, a professor, to get a better handle on the issue. When later asked if he\u2019d ever been confronted about human rights abuses on his previous trips to China, Kerr replied, \u201cNo. Nor has (America\u2019s) record of human rights abuses come up either\u2026 People in China didn\u2019t ask me about, you know, people owning AR-15s and mowing each other down in a mall.\u201d\n\nShowing contempt for your own country doesn\u2019t erase 70 years of mass murder, famine, and incomprehensible hardship for the Chinese people. The Chinese state not only sanctions concentration camps today, it subjects countless people to other forms of totalitarianism. Those who shoot AR-15s in American malls are criminals and murderers who are breaking an array of laws in a free country. Not a single politician or organization approves of their actions. The fact that Kerr would compare the two is at best clueless, and at worst shamefully unpatriotic.\n\n\u201cMy team and this league just went through a difficult week,\u201d LeBron ludicrously lamented after some well-deserved blowback to his initial comments, \u201cI think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen.\u201d\n\nWhat happened? The Chinese Basketball Association cut some ties with the Rockets, and it would probably cut ties with the NBA if players and managers had the decency to speak out.\n\nI suppose it\u2019s too much to expect NBA stars to back Hong Kong freedom fighters rather than agonize over rounding errors in their banking accounts. The NBA wants to make money in China. There\u2019s nothing wrong with exporting capitalism. But if the NBA is going to start adopting and enforcing the illiberalism of the Chinese state to make money, it becomes a huge ethical problem.", "description": "LeBron James says Daryl Morey \u201cwasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand\u201d when he tweeted out in support of Hong Kong\u2019s freedom demonstrations.
