You may also want to check out our round-up of Britain's spookiest places for a terrifying staycation.\n\n1. The Shining\n\n(Image: Warner Bros/Hawk Films/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe Timberline Lodge in Oregon played the part of the terrifying Overlook Hotel in Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's thriller, and plenty of exterior shots were used for filming.\n\nNowadays the Timberline is still a working hotel and it's popular for those after dreamy ski holidays (albeit with no sign of creepy twin ghosts or floods of blood!).\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHowever, Stephen King was actually inspired to write the Shining while staying at a different hotel; The Stanley Hotel in Colorado.\n\nIt's no surprise the Stanley got his creative juices flowing - the hotel is said to be haunted with some guests reporting sounds of an ominous piano being heard in the night.\n\n2. The Amityville Horror\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe 1979 horror film is said to be based on a true story of events at number 112 on Ocean Avenue in the town of Amityville.\n\nThe house was the setting for the 1974 murders where Ronald Defeo Jr shot and killed six members of his family.\n\nA year later, George and Kathy Lutz moved into the home with their three children but moved out after less than a month after claiming to have been terrorised by supernatural beings.\n\nAlthough you can't actually go inside the house which is privately owned, you can easily wander down Ocean Avenue and look out for the waterfront home.\n\n3. The Exorcist\n\n(Image: Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe steps were Father Damien Karras is thrown after jumping out of a window while possessed by the demon have become iconic.\n\nLocated in Washington DC's Georgetown neighbourhood, on the corner of Prospect Street and 36th Street NW, nowadays the steps are often visited by horror film fans on tours of iconic locations in the city.\n\nThey've been dubbed 'The Exorcist Stairs' and there's even a plaque to commemorate their brief Hollywood stint.\n\n4. Friday the 13th\n\n(Image: Rex)\n\nCamp Crystal Lake is a real place, but it goes by the name of Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco (and it doesn't have a terrifying killer out on a rampage).\n\n(Image: Paramount/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe camp, located in New Jersey, USA, is private property owned by the Boy Scouts of America so you can't turn up and have a wander around, but the good news is that you can join official guided tours which showcase the Friday the 13th filming locations.\n\n5. The Blair Witch Project\n\n(Image: 20th Century Fox)\n\nThe woods where the three students go in search of the Blair Witch are very real, as the film was shot on location.\n\nThe bulk of filming took place in Seneca Creek State Park in Maryland, USA.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the abandoned Black Rock Mill also caught the crew's attention as a filming spot, and film fans often visit as part of the Seneca Creek trail (although you can't go inside because of its decrepit condition).\n\n6. Texas Chainsaw Massacre\n\n(Image: Vortex-Henkel-Hooper/Bryanston/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre was - you guessed it - filmed across a series of locations in Texas. A lot of the locations are near Austin such as Bilbo's Texas Landmark (the gas station in the film), as well as Bagdad Cemetery.\n\nThe Sawyer family house where Leatherface and his cannibalistic family live is located in Kingsland, Texas on the grounds of the Antlers Hotel. (It was actually initially located about ten miles north of Austin but in 1998 it was bought by the hotel, dismantled and moved to its new home).\n\n7. Night of the Living Dead\n\n(Image: Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nIf you think you're brave enough to head to the cemetery where the the dead came alive and began hunting the living, then Evans City in Pennsylvania needs to be on your radar.\n\nIt was here that the bulk of scenes in the terrifying 1968 hit film were shot - and Evans City Cemetery is where the dead arose.\n\n8. The Hills Have Eyes\n\n(Image: Blood Relations/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThose creepy desert landscapes in the original 1977 were not the stuff of a studio film set, but shot on location in Victorville, California, in the Mojave Desert.\n\nHowever, unlike in the film there isn't an abandoned nuclear site which is secretly the home of flesh-eating mutants.\n\nWhat you will find are some pretty spectacular landscapes for a breathtaking road trip (far less dramatic than the one in the film) as well as hiking trails, caverns and a visitor's centre.\n\nThe 2006 remake however wasn't filmed in Victorville, but instead at Ouarzazate in Morocco.\n\n9. The Silence of the Lambs\n\n(Image: MGM)\n\nScenes for The Silence of the Lambs were shot across a host of locations in Pennsylvania such as Pittsburgh, Rural Valley, Homestead, Glenwillard and Canonsburg.\n\nBuffalo Bill's House is a real home in Perryopolis, although it's privately owned so you won't be able to go inside.\n\nUnlike in the film, where it was purposefully made to look run-down, the five-bedroom house is actually quite picturesque (and doesn't feature a torture chamber).\n\n10. The Birds\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nAlthough Daphne du Maurier's novel is set in England, Alfred Hitchcock's film adaptation was shot in Bodega Bay, California.\n\nLocals say that Hitchcock chose the bay because of its bleak treeless hills, as well as its quiet fishing harbour and the foggy weather conditions that are often found here.\n\nLocations include the Potter School, Taylor Street, Diekmann's Bay Store, as well as the Tides Wharf and Restaurant. Nowadays Bodega Bay has a visitor's centre where you can find guides with all of the locations.\n\nHowever the famous fire scenes were filmed at Universal Studios using special effects.\n\n11. The Witches\n\n(Image: Warner Bros/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThis film terrified us as children, and the worst part is that it all took place in the UK.\n\nIn fact, that horrific moment when the witches peel off their masks to reveal their spine-chilling real selves?\n\nThat scene took place at the Headland Hotel in Newquay - and nowadays hotel staff still have children keeping a look out for any mice who might need help.\n\n(For some comic relief, the hotel was also the setting for scenes in a Mr Bean episode).\n\n12. The Village of the Damned\n\n(Image: Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe Village of the Damned is a real village although it doesn't have the creepy goings-on that occur in the film.\n\nThe fictional village of Midwich is actually Letchmore Heath in Hertfordshire, while nearby Aldenham also served as a location for some of the exterior shots.\n\nIn the 1995 remake of the film, Midwich was recreated in Point Reyes Station, California.", "description": "Brave souls can visit the real-life horror film locations including the Shining hotel, the Friday the 13th camp and the Blair Witch Project woods", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Warner Bros Hawk Films Kobal Rex Shutterstock", "Getty Images", "Getty", "Moviestore Rex Shutterstock", "Rex", "Paramount Kobal Rex Shutterstock", "Century Fox", "Vortex-Henkel-Hooper Bryanston Kobal Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13116318.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_a2_The-Shining.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
