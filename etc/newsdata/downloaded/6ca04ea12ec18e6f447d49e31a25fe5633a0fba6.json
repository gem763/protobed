The \u201cFrida\u201d star took to Instagram where she posed on the beach in a blue bikini that showed off her curves. In the snap, she stands with her hands on her hips and a confused look on her face as she appears to be talking to her photographer.\n\nTHE LOVELY AND TALENTED SALMA HAYEK\n\n\u201cYes, tomorrow I\u2019m 53,\u201d she wrote in both English and Spanish in the photo\u2019s caption.\n\nThis is hardly the first time the star has been candid about showing off her body to highlight the complete lack of work she\u2019s had done to maintain her looks after all these years.\n\nSALMA HAYEK THROUGH THE YEARS, ALWAYS A BEAUTY\n\nShe previously told Town & Country in March that her good looks have absolutely nothing to do with any kind of plastic surgery.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t done an-y-thing,\u201d she admitted at the time. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it.\u201d\n\nThe Oscar-nominee also credits her success in life and her career with being a late bloomer. Hayek didn't marry until she was 39 and didn't become a mother to daughter Valentina until 41.\n\n\"I think I\u2019m a better mother because I had her later. But I do get tired, I\u2019m not going to lie,\" she admitted. As for her marriage to billionaire fashion mogul Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, she called him \"the best husband in the world.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I get to be who I am with him, and I don\u2019t feel that somebody tries to limit me,\" she added.\n\nFox News' Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.", "description": "Actress Salma Hayek showed off her physique with a fun beach snap\u00a0to celebrate her 53 birthday.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/Salma-Hayek-Getty.jpg"}
