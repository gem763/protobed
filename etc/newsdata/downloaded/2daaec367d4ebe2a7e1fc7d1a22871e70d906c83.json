We must help Brazil extinguish these fires and offer long-term support to prevent further illegal deforestation.\n\nTo get the job done, it is important to understand that while fires are burning in record numbers, they happen every year. The blazes and wider deforestation are driven by demand for agricultural land to meet the growing global demand for beef and animal feed. Rising global temperatures are also an exacerbating factor.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The country has a strong historical tradition of protecting the Amazon; in fact, between 2004 and 2012, Brazil managed to reduce deforestation by over 80 per cent. Yet since then we have gone backwards. In the immediate term, we need to do three key things.\n\nFirstly, it is time to return to stronger enforcement. More than 100 countries including Brazil have legislation enshrining the right to a healthy environment. But it is useless if it is not enforced properly. The message needs to be sent actions that destroy our natural world will not be tolerated.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It is essential that they are given more control and their rights are protected. This way our vital ecosystems will be stewarded effectively.\n\nOffering incentives to landowners and farmers \u2013 such as payments for conservation \u2013 has also worked. The international community and private sector have a clear role to play here. The Sustainable Commodities Facility is one route to provide finance to Brazilian farmers to grow soy on already cleared land instead of causing more deforestation.\n\nBut the Amazon is just one piece of the puzzle. Just as the rainforest is a haven for biodiversity and a natural defence against global warming, so too are the Congo Basin and Indonesian rainforests.\n\nWildfires are raging across Indonesia, as they do regularly. According to an analysis of satellite data run by the UNEPGRID centre in Geneva, there were more fires burning in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola than Brazil between 19 and 26 August.\n\nProtecting mega forests is clearly a global imperative. And the biggest positive action we could take is to reform the global food systems that are driving the climate crisis, biodiversity loss, water insecurity, and soil and water pollution.\n\nAgriculture and related land-use change are responsible for over 70 per cent of tropical deforestation and around one quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBrazil\u2019s drop in deforestation ended when commodity prices increased, demonstrating a clear link to the production and export of soy, beef and, to a lesser extent, ethanol/sugarcane. Increases in commodity prices have always led to more land grabbing globally. They have been a major driver of the Indonesian fires since the early 1980s.\n\nWe can break this cycle.\n\nThe private sector must step up, adopting zero-deforestation and sustainable commodity supply chain targets. Governments need to shift to more long-term public policies for sustainable agricultural production, integrated land-use planning at the national scale and sustainability standards. And citizens should continue to stand up and demand more responsible environmental policies from their governments \u2013 and their right to do so must be protected.\n\nIf we used all of the food we produced \u2013 we currently waste or lose about one-third \u2013 there would be less need to clear land. By switching to more sustainable proteins and a more plant-based diet, we can reduce the global demand for meat. Our actions on an individual level are important.\n\nAs we head towards 2020 \u2013 a crucial year in which the Paris Agreement will hit full stride, we need to remember the heart-breaking images of this natural wonder ablaze and do everything in our power to change our relationship with nature before it is too late.\n\nInger Andersen is the executive director of the UN Environment Programme", "description": "The Amazon rainforest, this wonder of nature sprawling across nine countries in Latin America, holds a special place on this planet.
