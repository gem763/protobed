This funds equipment and staffing costs to protect schools and community centres, where security gates and guards, CCTV cameras, barbed wire fences, even blast doors are now commonplace.\n\nBut money isn\u2019t enough. The government should also give police greater powers to deal with racially motivated violence and courts greater freedom to wield maximum penalties to deter the next delinquent intent on chucking a brick through a synagogue window, or worse. That would send a clear message that minorities do not stand alone.\n\nThe Halle attack is another grievous lesson in how racism rapidly moves from the web to the real world. Like the Christchurch mosque killer, the terrorist wore a webcam to live-stream the carnage and was no doubt inspired by conspiracy sites and blogs.\n\nIt\u2019s also a painful reminder of the ever-present threat from the far right at a time when British Jews have been focused on the antisemitism of the far left.\n\nNo matter how dire the statistics, British Jews define themselves not by antisemitism but the contribution they make to British life. Despite this self-confidence, Halle will have dealt another serious blow to their sense of security.", "description": "I\u2019m not religious, but I still went to synagogue yesterday for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.
