Johnson is thought to be proposing that Northern Ireland would leave the customs union with the rest of the UK.\n\n\n\nGoods entering from Great Britain would then be tracked and tariffs would be applied if they were to enter the Irish Republic.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nBrussels is not convinced the plan is workable and, even if it were, it could be implemented within the year-long transition problem.\n\n\n\nSomehow this has to be resolved by Wednesday evening if a deal is to be struck at the EU summit on Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe Times is reporting that Brussels may conclude that even if the outline of deal can be reach it will still require an extension in order for it to be ratified by the UK and European Parliaments.\n\n\n\nWould this be enough for Boris Johnson to say he has fulfilled his promise to leave on October 31 \u201cdo or die\u201d?\n\nIt is worth remembering that Johnson\u2019s proposal, if it is accepted, would leave the UK worse off and has no provisions for protecting workers\u2019 rights or ensuring environmental safeguards.\n\n\n\nAccording to the UK in a Changing Europe think tank the plan would see GDP per capita fall by between 2.3% and 7% in the next ten years.\n\n\n\nThis compares to May\u2019s deal which would see GDP per capita fall by 1.9% and 5.5%.\n\n\n\nToday's agenda:\n\n\n\n11.25am \u2013 State opening of Parliament.\n\n\n\n11.30am \u2013 Dennis Skinner\u2019s heckle.\n\n\n\n2.30pm \u2013 Speaker opens the Commons debate on the Queen\u2019s speech.\n\n\n\n10pm (approx) \u2013 Dan Jarvis MP debate on the 75th anniversary of Arnhem.\n\n\n\nWhat I am reading:\n\n\n\nKevin Maguire on why Jeremy Corbyn should back a referendum before an election", "description": "The Queen's Speech is a wish list by a Prime Minister who also wishes he had a majority to enact any of the proposed legislation", "authors": ["Jason Beattie", "Image", "Via Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20562282.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Britains-Prime-Minister-Boris-Johnson-appears-on-BBC-TVs-The-Andrew-Marr-Show.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
