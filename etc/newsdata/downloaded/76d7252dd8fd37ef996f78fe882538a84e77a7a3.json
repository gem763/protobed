He called the police for a \u201cwelfare check\u201d, to make sure the family was unharmed.\n\nWhen the two officers arrived at the property, Miss Jefferson, a medical graduate from Xavier University in New Orleans, who was working in pharmaceutical equipment sales, was in her bedroom.\n\nFort Worth police confirmed that Aaron Dean, 35, did not announce he was with the police, and nor did the pair park their patrol cars in front of the house. The force is investigating why.\n\nMr Dean and his colleague walked to the side of the house, opened the gate, and walked into the backyard, shining a torch around the property.\n\nHe saw someone through a house window, inside the home, and yelled: \u201cPut your hands up. Show me your hands!\u201d The officer then shot through the window. Officials said Mr Dean, who is white, \u201cperceived a threat.\u201d\n\nLee Merritt, a civil rights lawyer, said Miss Jefferson\u2019s death is another example of excessive use of police force in Fort Worth. Since June, Fort Worth officers have shot seven people, six of them fatally.\n\nEd Kraus, chief of Fort Worth police, said that Mr Dean resigned before he was fired. He said he expects to have an update on possible charges on Tuesday.\n\nBetsy Price, mayor of Fort Worth, said on Monday that Miss Jefferson\u2019s killing was entirely unjustifiable.\n\n\"There's nothing that can justify what happened on Saturday morning. Nothing,\" she said.\n\nShe also said that Fort Worth police should not have released an image of a firearm found inside Miss Jefferson's home.\n\n\"The gun was irrelevant,\" she said.\n\n\u201cAtatiana was an amazing, smart woman who was unjustly taken from her family. I cannot imagine anything worse and I am so sorry.\u201d\n\nThe shooting took place days after a Dallas police officer, Amber Guyger, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting a black man that she mistook as an intruder inside of his apartment, which she mistakenly entered.", "description": "A Texan policeman who shot and killed a black woman through the window as she was playing video games with her nephew resigned on Monday, and may face criminal charges.
