Body positivity activists questioned the lack of diversity on the runways, fans wondered why their favourite designers were absent from the lineup, and Extinction Rebellion tried to call the whole thing off.\n\nAnd of course there\u2019s also Brexit, which the British Fashion Council (BFC) says could set the industry back by \u00a3900m in a no-deal scenario.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpick, which is why model and activist Charli Howard has launched a new podcast series to do just that.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Guests include Mariah Idrissi, one of the first models to wear a hijab in a mainstream fashion campaign, and Kalpona Akter, a former child garment worker who now runs the Bangladesh Centre for Worker Solidarity.\n\nMany of the topics discussed in the series are ones that Howard has personally dealt with. In 2015, she found fame for writing an open letter on Facebook to her former modelling agency, who she claims dropped her from their books because, at a UK size eight, she was \u201ctoo big\u201d to get work.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty Images for Prada\n\nAhead of the series launch, Howard spoke to The Independent about the industry\u2019s glorification of homogenised beauty, avoiding castings with \u201cdodgy\u201d photographers and why London Fashion Week shouldn\u2019t be cancelled.\n\nWhy is it that in 2019 the fashion industry continues to champion a limited type of female beauty?\n\nThere are still a lot of people at the top who have done things a certain way for a long time, and because social media has developed so rapidly, I think a lot of brands find it hard to keep up with changes. But there\u2019s really no excuse anymore to use the same body shape and colour over and over. If you\u2019re a consumer buying a product, you deserve to see yourself represented. Using larger women doesn\u2019t mean that a brand\u2019s image will be cheapened; it can still be just as beautiful and aspirational.\n\nDo you think we\u2019ve reached a place where body diversity is being celebrated in the industry?\n\nAlthough we\u2019ve got a while to go before we truly see diversity on a day-to-day basis, I do think the industry is changing quite rapidly, especially in America, and a lot of that is down to social media. I\u2019ve mostly been working in New York for the past four years and most campaigns there feature women of every size, shape and colour. It wasn\u2019t uncommon 10 years ago to see image after image, advert after advert featuring the same white, tall, skinny women \u2013 which I think has created a generation of women feeling insecure about their bodies. But nowadays, if a brand isn\u2019t inclusive, a consumer can jump on their phone and complain on Instagram, meaning brands have to sit up, take notice and create positive imagery.\n\nWhy did you want to address #MeToo in the podcast? Is this a common problem within fashion and is it something you\u2019ve ever dealt with yourself?\n\nI\u2019ve definitely been in positions that I haven\u2019t felt comfortable with, like being groped, leered at, hearing crude comments or being sent weird messages before and after working with someone. There were times I asked agents not to send me on castings because I knew the photographer was dodgy, but I was told that it could \u2018affect my career\u2019 if I didn\u2019t go. If anything weird happened, I learnt not to say anything to anyone because I came to expect it. But thanks to MeToo, I realised that no one has to put up with behaviour that makes them feel uncomfortable.\n\nExtinction Rebellion is calling for the BFC to cancel LFW altogether: is that the right approach from an environmental perspective? What would you suggest?\n\nPersonally, I feel London Fashion Week is such a creative and exciting time for Britain, so I\u2019d hate for it to be cancelled completely like Stockholm Fashion Week.\n\nBut the Extinction Rebellion campaign is a wake-up call to remind us that in a Climate Emergency, it can\u2019t just be business as usual.\n\nCan retailers do more to promote sustainable fashion?\n\nI definitely think more can be done in terms of sustainability \u2013 whether that\u2019s brands coming together and donating to an environmental charity, or using fabrics that are recycled as well as recyclable, or even made from wild rubber or pineapple leaves! It\u2019s about making conscious decisions and thinking about the bigger picture: Earth.\n\nWhat can individuals do to help?\n\nI think we\u2019ve all got to accept that we need to buy less! Maybe all the fashion weeks \u2013 not just London \u2013 could do more to promote platforms that help us rent, repair or re-sell clothes. Because then we\u2019re really valuing all the craft and creativity that went in to making them in the first place.\n\nFashion Fix with Charli Howard is available now on BBC Sounds", "description": "The fashion industry is in a state of flux, and in the wake of London Fashion Week, there\u2019s much to discuss beyond the trends.", "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/19/15/1920-x-1080-charli.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
