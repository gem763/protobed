The meeting was the first such gathering in Washington since mass shootings in California, Texas and Ohio left dozens of people dead over the past several weeks, though Mr. Trump spoke with several lawmakers over the August recess.\n\nMr. Trump has previously voiced support for legislation expanding background checks for gun purchases, but he hasn\u2019t endorsed specific policy proposals. Lawmakers and White House officials remain skeptical that significant gun-control legislation can win congressional approval ahead of the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cHe basically said contribute whatever ideas,\u201d Sen. James Lankford (R., Okla.) said of Mr. Trump\u2019s guidance from the meeting. \u201cThe president\u2019s going to be able to continue to look at it.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you expect gun control legislation to come from the Trump administration? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nAides plan to brief Mr. Trump this week on his legislative and policy options on guns, said a person familiar with internal conversations. The White House has received ideas and proposals from agencies, lawmakers and outside groups.\n\nTopics that White House officials have discussed include improving background checks, removing guns temporarily from people considered dangerous\u2014sometimes called red-flag laws\u2014enhancing public-safety funding and subjecting mass shooters to expedited capital punishment.\n\nWhite House officials have also said they are considering the use of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System to alert state law-enforcement officials when a person prohibited from purchasing a firearm tries to buy a gun.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC poll published Monday showed that 86% of Americans support implementing red-flag laws and that 89% favor expanding federal background checks. The poll found a majority of support for both measures among Republicans, white evangelical Christians, members of gun-owning households and other conservative groups.\n\nActivists calling for Congress to pass gun-control legislation gathered outside the Capitol Hill on Tuesday, holding signs. One said \u201cVoters are watching.\u201d\n\nMayors from around the country who have faced shootings in their areas of jurisdiction also met with Mr. McConnell to urge him to bring legislation requiring background checks for all gun purchases.\n\nCongressional Republicans are looking to the White House for leadership on gun measures\u2014and political cover from Mr. Trump over what would likely be a tough vote for many GOP lawmakers regardless of what policy the president endorses.\n\n\u201cWhatever position he decides to adopt is very important to a lot of our members,\u201d said Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) of the president\u2019s position.\n\nSome Republicans, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have indicated support for red-flag laws. Mr. Graham and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) have proposed a federal grant program to help law enforcement work with mental-health professionals to remove guns from people deemed dangerous. Other Republicans are concerned over how such proposals would address gun owners\u2019 due process.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the White House\u2019s point of view, whatever it ends up being,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy (R., La.) \u201cI\u2019m sure it is going to be persuasive, but for me, it\u2019s not going to be dispositive.\u201d\n\nCurrent law allows unlicensed sellers to sell firearms at gun shows, online or elsewhere without a federal dealer\u2019s license or a background check on the buyer. An estimated 22% of U.S. gun owners acquired their most recent firearm without a background check, according to a 2017 survey published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Legislation passed by the House in February would require background checks for all gun purchases.\n\nThe Democratic-led House has encouraged the Senate to take up the background-checks bill and has made it clear that Democratic lawmakers plan to pursue more gun-related legislation without waiting for the president\u2019s endorsement.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is looking at legislation to ban high-capacity magazines and at two bills that would prevent gun ownership by those deemed a risk of hurting themselves or others, and for people convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes.\n\nDemocrats are worried that if they take the spotlight off the summer\u2019s mass shootings, their chance to pass significant legislation will fade as public attention diminishes.\n\n\u201cThis whole town is Groundhog Day, until it\u2019s not, until something changes,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.). \u201cWe may be being set up for another Groundhog Day experience in the next one or two weeks but I\u2019m not ready to concede that.\u201d\n\nWrite to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com, Lindsay Wise at lindsay.wise@wsj.com and Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com", "description": "Lawmakers remained divided over a legislative path to reduce mass shootings, with Republicans looking to the White House for guidance and Democrats pledging to press ahead with their own measures.", "authors": ["Natalie Andrews", "Lindsay Wise", "Catherine Lucey", "Natalie.Andrews Wsj.Com", "Lindsay.Wise Wsj.Com", "Catherine.Lucey Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105951/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
