I lost 40 pounds in this process. I'm reunited with my beautiful wife, I\u2019m working on the No. 1 show on MTV,\u201d he gushed. \u201cI\u2019m grateful and taking advantage of every moment, every conversation, every meal and just living my best life.\u201d\n\nMIKE 'THE SITUATION' SORRENTINO'S WIFE POSTS SEXY SNAP WEEKS AHEAD OF HUSBAND'S PRISON RELEASE\n\nThe MTV star was released on Sept. 12 after reporting in January to the Otisville Correctional Facility in New York. He was sentenced for tax offenses related to nearly $9 million in income.\n\nSorrentino said he was mostly left alone by the other inmates while serving his time. He compared the atmosphere of prison to high school with all its various cliques.\n\n\u201cThey really loved me,\u201d he said. \u201cI really lucked out. I was very grateful.\u201d\n\nThe TV star explained that, contrary to rumors, he didn\u2019t interact much with the orchestrator of the infamous failed Fyre Festival Billy McFarland, who was in the same prison. Sorrentino described him as friendly, \u201cvery quiet\u201d and \u201creserved.\u201d\n\nMIKE 'THE SITUATION' SORRENTINO POSTS FIRST PHOTO FROM PRISON AFTER FRIENDS, WIFE VISIT\n\n\u201cHe would say \u2018Hi,\u2019 but he wasn\u2019t in my group of friends. I played against him in basketball and softball maybe, but then he was thrown out of the prison.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe supposedly smuggled in some sort of recording device, and he was caught with it,\u201d Sorrentino added. \u201cThey said he was trying to record high-profile inmates and they threw him in the SHU [solitary housing unit]. They sent him to a worse prison, I think, recently. That\u2019s a bonehead move right there.\u201d\n\n'JERSEY SHORE' STAR RONNIE ORTIZ-MAGRO TAZED, ARRESTED ON CHARGES OF FELONY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE\n\nSorrentino, who worked out twice a day in the joint, also revealed he had an encounter with President Donald Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen.\n\n\u201cHe was a bit nervous,\u201d he said about Cohen. \u201cI was there for like three or four months, and I was like, 'Listen, bro, I'm going to need you to do something for me\u2026 I'm going to need you to smuggle chicken from the main line and give it to me, I'm going to hide it in my locker, so I can have an extra serving after my workout.''\n\nSorrentino said that Cohen agreed but was unable to smuggle him extra food past the guards.\n\nOnce he got out, Sorrentino revealed, all he wanted to do was relax at home. However, the MTV producers had other plans.\n\nMIKE \u2018THE SITUATION\u2019 SORRENTINO\u2019S WIFE SAYS HE\u2019S RECEIVED \u2018THOUSANDS OF LETTERS\u2019 IN PRISON\n\n\u201cWhen I first got home, all I wanted to do was spend time with my beautiful wife, I wanted to have a naked pizza party,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI wanted to watch movies. I wanted to watch \u2018Avengers,\u2019 I wanted to watch \u2018Game of Thrones.\u2019\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, duty called and \u201cThe Situation\u201d had to report to work on \u201cJersey Shore: Family Vacation\u201d just days after his release.\n\n\u201cI pretty much took the ball and started to run with it immediately. I started working the day I came out. I saw you guys the next day,\u201d he said. \u201cI moved [to the house] a couple of days later. I wasn't mentally ready but at the same time it's my job.
