VPC\n\nA bill signed Saturday by California Gov. Gavin Newsom plans to cut the recent trend in schools of \"lunch shaming.\"\n\nSB 265, which was originally introduced by California State Sen. Robert Hertzberg, will require that all public school students have a \"state reimbursable\" meal provided by the school \"even if their parent or guardian has unpaid meal fees.\"\n\nIt amends the Child Hunger Prevention and Fair Treatment Act of 2017, which previously stated that students with lunch debts be offered \"alternative\" meals by school districts, charter schools and boards of education.\n\nThe phenomenon of \"lunch-shaming\" students nationwide, which has included taking away meals on students' birthdays, firing cafeteria employees and threatening to send students to foster care \u2014 has drawn ire from parents, fellow students and business owners in recent months.\n\n'Worst birthday ever!': School changes lunch policy after taking away student's cheesy breadsticks on his birthday\n\nNewsom referred to the story of Ryan Kyote, a third-grader in Napa, California, who used up his saved allowance to pay off his classmates' outstanding debts after seeing that a student was forced to return her hot lunch because of her debt. The two met in August, which Newsom called an \"honor.\"\n\n\u201cI want to thank Ryan for his empathy and his courage in bringing awareness to this important issue,\u201d said Newsom in a statement.\n\nGovernor @GavinNewsom had the honor to meet Ryan Kyote last week. This amazing young man saved his allowance and used it to pay his classmates\u2019 lunch debt. For Ryan, it was just wrong that some kids couldn\u2019t afford to eat lunch. He\u2019s right about that. #CaliforniaForAllpic.twitter.com/4DIse1OEGo \u2014 Office of the Governor of California (@CAgovernor) August 9, 2019\n\nNearly 500,000 children might no longer be automatically eligible for free lunch as a result of a Trump administration proposal to reduce \"loopholes\" in food stamp access.\n\nFollow Joshua Bote on Twitter: @joshua_bote\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/14/california-signs-bill-end-lunch-shaming-meals-all-students/3972897002/", "description": "SB 265 will require that all public school students have a meal provided by the school \"even if their parent or guardian has unpaid meal fees.\"", "authors": ["Joshua Bote", "Published A.M.
