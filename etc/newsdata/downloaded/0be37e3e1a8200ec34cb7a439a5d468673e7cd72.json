It all began yesterday, with the spread widening on BitMEX and futures contracts getting continuously liquidated.\n\nConnecting BitMEX Outflows and BTC Price\n\nYesterday\u2019s downside BTC price move was well anticipated, but the speed with which it occurred was unexpected. According to reports furnished by CryptoQuant, an on-chain data solutions provider this can be largely attributed to ~$700 million worth of contracts liquidated during this decline.\n\nBitcoin outflows from BitMEX act as leading indicators for these mass liquidations, and the mass volatility that results. Being the largest bitcoin futures exchange out there, BitMEX is notorious for influencing BTC price action. How exactly the platform\u2019s margin calls activity dealt a loss-laced blow to the top cryptocurrency needs a deeper insight.\n\nTime and again flow models have been used as one of the key metrics for understanding bitcoin price behavior, and the analysis regarding the same is well-established. But standard models of inflow/outflow don\u2019t really fit well with BitMEX.\n\nBitmex BTC outflows have a pretty pronounced effect on bitcoin\u2019s volatility, which in turn can cause the price to appreciate as well as depreciate, courtesy, the exchange\u2019s special withdrawal policy. While deposits are available round the clock, withdrawals happen only once during the day, at UTC 13:00.\n\nIn this constricted time-frame, outflows tend to exceed inflows by large multiples. Following which, a liquidity shortage, and an increase in the spread takes place. These attributes lead to BitMEX margin positions getting exposed to a liquidity shortage and cascading liquidations.\n\nWhen the bitcoin outflow on BitMEX exceeds a certain point, the potential for these large moves increases significantly. Based on on-chain data, it appears that when more than 5,000 BTC is withdrawn in one day, the exposure to this volatility multiplies manifold.\n\nNow moving on to what happened exactly.\n\nFrom BTC Outflow to Bitcoin Price Volatility\n\nTaking a quick glance at CryptoQuant\u2019s on-chain data regarding bitcoin inflows and outflows from BitMEX on November 14, 2018, April 19 and September 25 i.e yesterday, it can be seen that there is a clear correlation between price volatility and outflows.\n\nOn each of these dates, the price volatility occurred within a short period following the BitMEX daily withdrawal at 13:00 UTC.\n\nOnce liquidity dried up, bitcoin price quickly responded. On September 24, on-chain it was recorded that 49141 BTC was withdrawn from the BitMEX wallet. Volatility followed within 5 hours, with the price falling over 8%. Due to the precision of the on-chain data, we can see the exact block in which the BitMEX outflows spiked.\n\nWhat do you think about BitMEX\u2019s role in causing the bitcoin market to crash?
