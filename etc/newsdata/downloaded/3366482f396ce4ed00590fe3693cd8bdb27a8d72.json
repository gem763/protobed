It is also the position of the central government that Hong Kong should tackle the problem on her own,\u201d Lam said at a press conference.\n\n\u201cBut if the situation becomes so bad, then no options can be ruled out if we want Hong Kong to at least have another chance,\u201d she added ominously.\n\nLam responded to a question about widespread defiance of her ban on masks by saying that, like \u201cany new policy or new legislation,\u201d the ban \u201cwill take time to be effectively implemented.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf a piece of legislation has been enacted but the people refuse to abide by the law, then we have a problem at hand,\u201d she admitted.\n\nIn theory, protesters who wear masks in public could face up to a year in jail and thousands of dollars in fines. In practice, only 16 people had been arrested for violating the ban as of Tuesday morning, despite thousands of demonstrators ignoring Lam\u2019s order and wearing masks. In one embarrassing incident on Sunday, the police decided to confiscate gas masks worn by reporters who were attempting to cover a street clash in which tear gas had been deployed.\n\nLam refused to comment on rumors that she might use her new emergency powers to shut down Internet access in a bid to control the protests or impose other forms of censorship.\n\n\u201cWe currently have no plans to invoke the Emergency Regulations Ordinance again to make new laws,\u201d she said.\n\nLam said the protests are causing \u201csignificant\u201d damage to Hong Kong\u2019s economy and way of life, and \u201cheavily weighing on various industries including retail, services, tourism, catering and others.\u201d Hotel bookings are reportedly down by 28 percent and tourist visitors have fallen by almost 50 percent.\n\n\u201cThe damage might lead to rising unemployment,\u201d she warned, noting that the suffering industries employ tens of thousands of people.\n\nLam rebuffed criticism from Western officials, notably including Hong Kong\u2019s last British Governor Chris Patten, by claiming other countries would deal with the protest movement the same way she has.\n\n\u201cIf such a situation happened on their soil, I believe their countermeasures would not be any lighter than what we have taken,\u201d she argued.", "description": "Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam says she will not rule out asking the mainland Chinese government for help.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1174359141-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
