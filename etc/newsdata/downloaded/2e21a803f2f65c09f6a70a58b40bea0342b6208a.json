(AP) - When Carter Rowney\u2019s short-handed goal sailed into the Carolina net, the Anaheim Ducks had scored nine consecutive goals across two games against two of the best teams in the Eastern Conference.\n\nA few months after the Ducks missed the playoffs, they\u2019ve started superbly under a new coach preaching speed, discipline and fun.\n\nAdam Henrique and Troy Terry scored in the first period, Ryan Miller made 22 saves and the Ducks remained unbeaten at home with a 4-2 victory over the Hurricanes on Friday night.\n\nRowney scored early in the second period to put the Ducks up 4-0, chasing Carolina goalie Petr Mrazek during a tremendous offensive surge by the NHL\u2019s lowest-scoring team last season. Jakob Silfverberg also scored in the second period for the Ducks, who are off to a 6-2-0 start under new coach Dallas Eakins after missing the postseason last spring for the first time since 2012.\n\n\u201cIf we just keep working hard and rolling, we know we\u2019re going to be a tough team to play against,\u201d said revitalized forward Rickard Rakell, who had two assists. \u201cWe feel good right now. We don\u2019t fear anything. We create a lot of scoring chances now. It\u2019s a lot of fun playing this way.\u201d\n\nThe Ducks have won their first four games at Honda Center for the first time in five years. After falling behind 2-0 to Buffalo on Wednesday night, the Ducks scored five straight to beat the Sabres and then jumped to a four-goal lead on the Canes, much to the delight of a home crowd supporting a team that managed an NHL-low 196 goals last year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a group in there that\u2019s all pulling in the same direction, and it\u2019s fun to watch,\u201d Eakins said. \u201c(This win) gives us confidence. That\u2019s a team over there that\u2019s had a great start. They had a hell of a season last year, and for us to come in and be able to skate with them, it reinforces what we\u2019re trying to build.\u201d\n\nHaydn Fleury scored his first NHL goal for the Hurricanes, who lost in two of their three stops on a California road swing after a 5-1-0 start to the season. Erik Haula scored the Canes\u2019 opening goal before leaving with an injury shortly afterward from a check by Anaheim\u2019s Josh Manson.\n\nMrazek yielded four goals on 14 shots, with Rowney\u2019s impressive short-handed score ending his night. Mrazek has alternated starts with James Reimer all season, and he posted his 19th career shutout against the Kings on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI hate doing that,\u201d Carolina coach Rod Brind\u2019Amour said of his first in-game goalie change of the season. \u201cIt\u2019s not his fault. We hung him out to dry. We had a lot of guys sleeping tonight. I didn\u2019t need to see him in there getting hung out to dry.\u201d\n\nHaula tipped home a power-play goal midway through the second period, getting his sixth in nine games to start the season. He went to the dressing room moments later after going down hard on an apparently clean check into the boards from Manson, who wasn\u2019t penalized.\n\nHaula has an upper-body injury, and he will be re-evaluated in Raleigh. Carolina enforcer Joel Edmundson fought Manson a few minutes later.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good teammate, right?\u201d Brind\u2019Amour said of Edmundson. \u201cHe sees one of his guys get, he feels, gets cheap-shotted, and he stood up for him. So it says a lot about him for sure.\u201d\n\nFleury scored his first goal in his 96th NHL game, walking in from the blue line for an unobstructed shot. The 23-year-old defenseman is in his third season with Carolina.\n\n\u201cThis year, I felt from the first game that I\u2019ve had chances to score each night,\u201d Fleury said. \u201cHit a post against Tampa, and now we are here.\u201d\n\nMiller was strong in a scoreless third period. The 39-year-old veteran backup to John Gibson has yielded three goals in his two starts.\n\n\u201cThere was no flow to that game,\u201d said Brind\u2019Amour, who played 1,643 games in his two-decade NHL career. \u201cIt was one of the worst hockey games I\u2019ve been around.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Anaheim D Brendan Guhle missed his fourth straight game with a lower-body injury, but C Devin Shore returned from a two-game absence. \u2026 Carolina dressed 11 forwards and seven defensemen, with Sebastian Aho, captain Jordan Staal and Teuvo Ter\u00e4v\u00e4inen logging extra minutes up front. \u2026 Silfverberg played in his 500th NHL game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHurricanes: A five-day break before visiting the Columbus Blue Jackets on Thursday.\n\nDucks: Host the Calgary Flames on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When Carter Rowney's short-handed goal sailed into the Carolina net, the Anaheim Ducks had scored nine consecutive goals across two games against two of the best teams in the Eastern Conference.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/hurricanes_ducks_hockey_83451_c0-132-3174-1983_s1200x700.jpg?86fed414b4745921e66a4cfb5a47562166a7d707", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
