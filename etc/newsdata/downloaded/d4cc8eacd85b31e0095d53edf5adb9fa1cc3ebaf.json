The Terrapins expect a packed stadium that could help coach Mike Locksley and his team pull off an upset to get back on track after the Temple loss.\n\nLocksley expressed faith in starting quarterback Josh Jackson after his shaky performance two weeks ago, and said Jackson has turned in good practices and worked with offensive coordinator Scottie Montgomery on areas to improve.\n\n\u201cI take it back to having the right kind of eye discipline as a quarterback in the RPO game,\u201d Locksley said at his weekly press conference Monday. \u201cWe went back and looked at the tape \u2026 I think that that\u2019s kind of an outlier game for Josh. He\u2019s a guy that really has made really good choices and been really disciplined.\n\nJackson \u2014 who went 15-for-38 passing for 183 yards, one touchdown and one interception \u2014 liked the word Locksley chose.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019d definitely like to chalk that up as an outlier,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt was not a very good game on my side. Probably one of my worst games in college. So yeah, we\u2019ll leave that as an outlier and hopefully it stays like that.\u201d\n\nJackson said he has to do better seeing the field, something he doesn\u2019t normally struggle with. The offense also focused on red-zone situations after coming up crucially short in that area against Temple.\n\nThe Terrapins will need a strong game from Jackson to beat the Nittany Lions, who are undefeated through three games. Or maybe not.\n\nAfter all, Maryland ranks eighth in FBS football in rushing offense with 277.3 yards per game along with 12 touchdowns, thanks to running backs Anthony McFarland Jr., Javon Leake and Tayon Fleet-Davis.\n\n\u201cI could care less if I\u2019m in a rhythm,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIf we\u2019re just running the ball and Ant and Fleet and Leake are all in a rhythm, I don\u2019t think it matters too much for me if they\u2019re just taking care of it.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t a sign of disinterest from Jackson. A few seconds later, he admitted, \u201cI guess as (Locksley) was saying, I\u2019m pretty laid back.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the coach had just finished noting how cool-headed Jackson usually remains, not allowing highs or lows to affect him.\n\n\u201cIn my experience, I like that quarterback that feeds and has the energy,\u201d Locksley said, but added, \u201cJosh has got to play to his personality, just like as a coach, I\u2019ve got to coach to my personality. But we both kind of have a happy medium there.\u201d\n\nEven as the program anticipates a big crowd on Friday, Locksley tried to downplay its effect on the team. He said the Terrapins \u201cinsulate\u201d themselves from campus and control what they can control.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to hear we\u2019ll hopefully have the type of crowd that our players deserve to have,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cI know our fans are excited about this game, but for us, all of our focus is on being the best version of Maryland football that we can be come Friday.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
