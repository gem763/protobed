Get caught up and ready to get on with the weekend, because it\u2019s hard keeping pace in a digital traffic jam.\n\nHere\u2019s what you missed while you were away.\n\nThis lower-priced Porsche Taycan wants to take on Tesla\u2019s Model S\n\nPorsche has introduced another, more affordable but just-as-attractive variant to the Taycan lineup. The Taycan 4S starts at $119,400, which is about the same as the Panamera 4S, over $50,000 cheaper than the base Taycan Turbo and nearly $100,000 less than the Turbo S.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s a tad more expensive than a Tesla Model S, but can we agree it\u2019s got more style? With twin electric motors, the base all-wheel-drive Taycan 4S gets 407 km of range and manages the sprint from zero to 100 km/h in 4.0 seconds. Expect to see the Taycan 4S on Canadian roads summer 2020.\n\nToyota may replace recalled Supras with new cars\n\nToyota is proposing a drastic solution to what seems on the surface to be a small issue. The problem? Faulty seat belt mount welds. The fix? An entirely new vehicle.\n\nThat\u2019s right, a BMW recall on certain Toyota Supras may see seven owners driving away with brand-new vehicles, all due to some spotty welding work. \u201cIf the driver\u2019s safety belt guide loop mount was not welded to specifications, then in a crash of sufficient severity, the mount could become damaged and may not restrain the driver as designed which would increase the risk of injury to the driver,\u201d the recall reads. Four of seven have already been replaced.\n\nElon Musk forecasts Tesla truck arrival in November\n\nAccording to the second-most-influential Twitter user in the world, Elon Musk, the wait for the electric truck is nearly over. The Tesla CEO laid out the schedule for the much-anticipated electric pickup\u2019s arrival earlier this summer and recently Tweet-confirmed everything is still on pace.\n\nStyling remains a mystery (see photo above) with Musk touting a design that\u2019s \u201creally futuristic-like cyberpunk Blade Runner design,\u201d but all shall be revealed in no more than a month and a half.\n\nU.S. government auctioning Trans Am owned by Burt Reynolds, plus 148 other classics\n\nIn December 2018, U.S. Marshals brought the full might of the law down on a couple of ponzi schemers who had swindled Warren Buffet, among others, out of over US$800 million. Among the possessions seized from the pair was a collection of 149 classic cars, which included a low-mileage 1978 Pontiac Trans Am formerly owned by OG bandit Burt Reynolds.\n\nThe lot will be auctioned off following the conclusion of the case and will be the single largest car collection ever sold by the U.S. Marshals.\n\nNew Honda Fit not likely to come to Canada\n\nHonda has confirmed there\u2019s another Fit on the way, but it hasn\u2019t said if it\u2019ll find its way to North America. And, based on the general decline of the small car sector, the fact the Fit press release called it only by its European name \u201cJazz,\u201d and in light of Fit sales being down both in Canada and the U.S. this season, there\u2019s a good chance it won\u2019t be.\n\nWe asked Honda Canada how the next-gen tiny Honda fits into the Canadian market but it wouldn\u2019t comment on future vehicles just now\u2014Honda America is singing the same tune.", "description": "The Taycan 4S offers a cheaper way into an electric Porsche, U.S. Marshals auction off a classic Trans Am, Honda dangles the new Fit and more", "authors": ["Hours Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/01-porsche-taycan-4s-.jpg?quality=80", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
