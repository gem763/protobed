The village\u2014Varvandi\u2014sits on the edge of the Pune-Solapur highway in Maharashtra, has two-wheelers parked outside most homes and women who work in the city and commute independently.\n\nDespite the semblance of modernity, Thorat bears the burden of an age-old superstitious practice that makes the haircut she is about to have somewhat contentious.\n\nFor the last nine years, Thorat has had a jata or dreadlocks in her hair, which she has been forbidden from chopping off. All in the name of a superstition that believes naturally matted hair braided or tangled together is a boon from Goddess Yellamma, a Hindu deity. It\u2019s a common belief among many in the southern part of Maharashtra and North Karnataka, who think dreadlocks are a sign of the goddess\u2019 possession, and cutting or cleaning it\u2014even if lice-infested and dirty\u2014will bring misfortune. As a result, many women end up living with a jata for years\u2014with hair often weighing several kilograms, leading to the women being unable to move their necks, developing infections and fevers, and mental health issues.\n\nSavitha Thorat has had matted hair since almost a decade, that she was not allowed to cut off because of the belief that it's a boon from Goddess Yellamma.\n\nNandini Jadhav, an activist and district chief of Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti (MANS) and its state chief Milind Deshmukh have been fighting this practice since the last four years. \u201cShe is our sister. How can we see her suffer like this in god\u2019s name?\u201d Jadhav asks the women gathered in the kitchen, explaining that the haircut won\u2019t invite divine wrath on Thorat and the village. Just good hygiene.\n\nThe superstitious belief and its religious stamp of approval make it a favourite playing field for self-proclaimed faith healers and godmen who exploit the women and their families financially, forcing them to do pujas and rituals that often cost a lot.\n\nThorat herself believe initially the jata was a boon from the Goddess. \u201cWhy else would it form overnight, I thought,\u201d she tells VICE. As the knots grew bigger, Thorat, who works in a local hotel and stays with her daughter\u2019s family was scared to cut it off, even if she was financially drained. \u201cI have spent more than Rs 1 lakh and taken loans to do the rituals, visited Yellamma temple in Saundatti (North Karnataka), and done everything required and advised by Godmen.\u201d\n\nWhat changed her mind, we ask. \u201cIt became inconvenient for me to sleep, lie down, move my head. I thought no Goddess would want me to suffer so much.\u201d It was also the counselling by Jadhav, who has managed to cut the dreadlocks of more than 130 women in Maharashtra, that worked. Jadhav showed her photos and videos of these women and assured her that nothing catastrophic had befallen them.\n\nAs Jadhav puts on gloves and gets ready to relieve Thorat of an almost decade-long burden in 30 minutes, a mixed crowd gathers around. Jadhav doesn\u2019t mind the audience. She believes it\u2019s these people who become ambassadors of dreadlock removal when they see that no harm has befallen post the haircuts.\n\nA Tangle Of Superstition\n\nThere is no exact explanation of the medical reason behind jata formation. The dominant theory is lack of proper hygiene, says Dr Govind Dhaske, researcher and author of Jata Removal Movement: Unfolding the \u2018Gender\u2019 in Politico-Religious Society. \u201cThe problem occurs when it is deified at an early stage.\u201d\n\nWhile dreadlocks may be a cultural or fashion statement for some, it\u2019s far from that for the almost 400 affected women in Maharashtra, says Dr Dhaske. He isn\u2019t quite sure why it holds a connection to the deity but adds that in India, \u201cmatted hair has always held religious, shamanic, ritualistic and devotional value.\u201d\n\nIt also led women to the regressive Devadasi (servant of God) practice. \u201c90 percent of unmarried women with jata faced this. While the Devadasi Abolition Act has banned the practice now, it was rampant until the 90s,\u201d Dr Dhaske tells VICE.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exploitation of women at a physical, emotional, social and financial level.\u201d\u2014Nandini Jadhav\n\nEven without it, young girls have it the worst. Take the case of Harshada Pingale, an 11-year-old girl from Ghawar village in Maharashtra, who had jata for seven years, isolating her in school and keeping her in a state of constant ill-health, malnutrition and depression. \u201cIt took me three months to counsel her mother who believed cutting it off would harm her sons,\u201d recalls Jadhav. \u201cFinally one day our team reached the village and managed to convince the mother and the villagers after five hours of talking. It was only when I started cutting the girl\u2019s hair and they saw the lice and festering wound in her scalp that they realised how much pain the little girl had been in.\u201d\n\nThe Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, (2013) stipulates preventing a person from seeking medical treatment, and encouraging inhumane activities as a punishable crime. But Dr Dhaske adds that despite this, \u201cmessages from religious-based entities often direct a jata-affected woman to stop taking medication and maintain personal hygiene in the name of religious conventions.\u201d\n\nBattling Dreadlocks\n\nMANS and other teams working on Jata Nirmulan (dreadlock removal) get anonymous tip-offs about victims of this practice. Sometimes, the woman herself calls the organisation, realising after years of ordeal that it is no divine blessing. Rekha (name changed on request), 32, from Pune\u2019s Kharadi area did not remove her dreadlocks for four years fearing a godman\u2019s advice that her husband, a cancer patient, would die if she did so. When even that didn\u2019t save her husband, a distraught Rekha, who couldn\u2019t find a job because of her dreadlocks, approached Jadhav for a scissor-session.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exploitation of women at a physical, emotional, social and financial level,\u201d says Jadhav. She and her team have faced slammed doors, been shouted at and threatened, sometimes by an entire village. The team treads carefully, showing them videos of jat removal and spending anywhere between eight days to two years counselling people. \u201cWe respect their faith and don\u2019t interfere with it,\u201d says Deshmukh. \u201cWe just tell them that the jata is not divine, just bad health and superstition.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s life like for the women once the dreadlocks have disappeared? Young girls like Pingale now attend school just like other children in the village, and are no longer made to sit separately. She doesn\u2019t fall sick as often either.\n\nPushpa Pavle, 67, from Manzar village got her dreadlocks cut off in May 2019 after her son approached Jadhav. \u201cEarlier people wouldn\u2019t come close to me as it would smell and would even call me mad. My health was becoming weaker. Now I feel lighter,\u201d she tells VICE.\n\n\u201cEarlier people wouldn\u2019t come close to me as it would smell and would even call me mad. My health was becoming weaker. Now I feel lighter.\"\u2014Pushpa Pavle\n\nSarita Tai, 50, had dreadlocks weighing 4-5 kgs and says that despite the social pressure to not cut her hair, there were no marriage proposals for her daughter because of the stigma associated. \u201cNow there are rishtas (proposals) coming after removing,\u201d she beams.\n\nNandini Jadhav counsels a group on the advantages of chopping off dreadlocks.

Jadhav thinks that superstition goes beyond communities and income groups too. She has chopped dreadlocks off an IT professional\u2019s hair, successfully counselled a bank manager\u2019s wife to get rid of her dreadlocks and even seen a government official carry the burden on her head.\n\n\u201cSuperstition has no boundaries,\u201d she sighs. And sometimes reason and a pair of scissors are the only ways to battle that.\n\nFollow Reshmi Chakraborty on Twitter.", "description": "A religious superstition is prohibiting some women in Maharashtra from cutting their matted hair, even if they're lice-infested and weighing them down in ways more than one.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db03a85055833008cb93eaf/lede/1571830519220-Indian-Dreadlocks-2-1.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7948xh;0xw,0.0169xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
