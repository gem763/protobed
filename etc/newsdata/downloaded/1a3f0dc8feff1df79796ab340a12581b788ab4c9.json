Everyone who's doubling [up in events] knows how it is. It's definitely a marathon \u2026 but I'm up for the challenge.\"\n\nDe Grasse returned to the track at Khalifa International Stadium after clocking 9.90 in the 100, a personal best that beat the Markham, Ont., sprinter's 9.91 from the final at the 2016 Olympics in Rio.\n\nThe 24-year-old's fastest time in 2019 is 19.87.\n\nWATCH | Andre De Grasse breezes to heat win:\n\nCanada's Andre De Grasse advances to 200m semifinals with a time of 20.20. 2:55\n\n\"Coach [Rana Reider] told me to blast out of that first 50, 60 [metres], come off the turn and see where you're at and if you're in good position, shut it down and get ready for [Monday] because we barely got any rest last night [after a late 100 final].\"\n\nRodney, 27, crossed the line in 20.38 behind Jereem Richards of Trinidad and Tobago (20.23) and top-ranked Noah Lyles (20.26) of the United States in the seventh heat.\n\n\"I'm happy with that time and ready for [the semifinals],\" said Rodney, who noted he's in shape to repeat his 19.96 PB at the Rio Olympic trials in 2016. \"I just have to get in the lane and execute.

De Grasse is expected to be in the mix, as will Divine Oduduru of Nigeria, the NCAA champion at both 100 and 200.\n\nColeman won the 100 in a runaway, clocking a 9.76 PB and beating Justin Gatlin to the line by .13 seconds, the largest margin of victory at worlds or the Olympics since 2011.\n\nMen's 800 final: McBride out, Arop in\n\nA series of podium finishes has ended for middle-distance runner Brandon McBride while Canadian teammate Marco Arop's medal hopes remain.\n\nThe 25-year-old McBride faded in the final metres of the men's 800 semifinals on Sunday and crossed the line in one minute 46.21 seconds.

No reason was given, but injuries have hampered her form over the last year.\n\nNigerian sprinters win appeal\n\nWhen Nigerian sprinter Divine Oduduru finally did fall asleep in the wee hours of Sunday morning in Doha, he still had no idea whether he'd be running at the world championships or kicked out of the meet.\n\nBecause of a mix-up by their nation's track federation, Oduduru and teammate Blessing Okagbare were each disqualified after they didn't show up for the 100-metre races that they never intended to run. Only after an appeal and a long wait did they find out they were back in.\n\nOduduru ended up qualifying for Monday's 200 semifinals at 1:50 p.m. ET. Okagbare will also run Monday in the women's 200 heats at 10:05 a.m.\n\n\"It's tough, but for you to be a great athlete, you have to have a great attitude,\" Oduduru said.\n\nThe problems stemmed from a rule that states that if athletes don't show up for races, they're disqualified from the rest of the meet.\n\nOduduru and Okagbare had told their federation they weren't running in the 100, but the federation put their names on the entry form anyway. They had to appeal the decision, and not until 2 p.m. Sunday \u2014 about five hours before race time \u2014 did Oduduru actually know he was in.\n\nCBC Sports has exclusive live coverage of the 2019 World Track & Field Championships from Sept. 27-Oct. 6.
