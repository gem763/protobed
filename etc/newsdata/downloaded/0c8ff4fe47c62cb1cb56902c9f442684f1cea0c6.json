Let me know if you ever start a Kmart men's boot camp, most definitely happy to sign my husband up,' someone else commented.\n\nMembers of the Facebook group replied to her post with hilarious remarks, including one woman who asked if her husband has a single brother (stock image)\n\nPhotos showing the interior of the car decked out with the plastic plant were anonymously shared to a Facebook page, along with a caption explaining how being married to a Kmart fan can sometimes result in some 'unfortunate' choices.\n\nWithin moments of posting, hundreds flooded the page to say they were shocked and astounded by the tastelessness of the idea.\n\nEarlier this year, another Australian woman was left horrified when her Kmart-obsessed husband decorated their family car with fake ivy.\n\nA horrified woman was shocked to discover her husband had decked out the family car in faux ivy\n\nHowever, a few cheeky people said they thought the 'hack' was potentially a 'genius' way of keeping kids separated.\n\n'OMG I needed this today! Brenda, you are a genius! The invisible curtain in the car didn't work today to separate me from the bickering kids,' said one.\n\nAnother added: 'Hold up!! If this is so you don't have to look at screaming kids in the backseat then it's genius.'", "description": "An Australian woman couldn't contain her amusement when she sent her husband to Kmart for two small essentials - only to have him return with an array of 38 items worth $350.", "authors": ["Alice Murphy For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/06/19774044-0-image-a-36_1571204342909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
