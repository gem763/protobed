But it happens,\u201d the two-times Olympic medallist said.\n\nLavillenie said he had found himself in the wrong rhythm when trying to clear 5.70m.\n\n\u201cDespite all my experience I wasn\u2019t able to get out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the qualifications trap. I\u2019m not the first to miss them and I certainly won\u2019t be the last.\u201d\n\nLavillenie\u2019s rival Armand Duplantis, the reigning European champion from Sweden, fought his jitters to secure a spot in the final by clearing 5.75m on his third and final attempt.\n\n\u201cI got a little too comfortable in the 5.75m. It was a mistake,\u201d the 19-year-old told Reuters. \u201cBut I move on. I live to see another day.\u201d\n\nDuplantis, who has trained with Lavillenie in the past, said the Frenchman\u2019s absence from the final on Tuesday would be felt by other competitors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be as fun out there without him,\u201d Duplantis said. \u201cI think I jump better when I\u2019m jumping with him. It just wasn\u2019t his day today.\u201d\n\nValentin Lavillenie, Renaud\u2019s brother, and Sam Kendricks of the United States, who is the season\u2019s leader with a personal best of 6.06m, qualified for the final.", "description": "French pole vaulter Renaud Lavillenie, the world record holder, said he wasn't able to recover his composure after \"stupid things\" threw him off course in qualifying at the world athletics championships on Saturday.", "authors": ["Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434951826&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0OG", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
