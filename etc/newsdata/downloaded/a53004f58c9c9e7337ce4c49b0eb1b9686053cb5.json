This is Money podcast", "language": "en", "text": "As we fast approach one fifth of the way through the 21st century, the world of finance is modernising in ways that would have been unimaginable a few years ago. And not always in a good way.\n\nThe language of \u2018savings\u2019 has evolved to the point of dishonesty and even fraud.\n\nOn this week\u2019s podcast editor Simon Lambert and reporter George Nixon join host Georgie Frost to look at fancy new Innovative Finance Isas, at savings products that claim to offer 8% returns and to be protected by the official savings watchdog but are in fact risky investments \u2013 and the fraud investigation at London Capital and Finance, where thousands of \u2018savers\u2019 lost millions of pounds.\n\nSimon guides listeners through the dark side of mini-bonds and the complex web of companies that savers\u2019 money was poured into at LC and F before it collapsed owing \u00a3236m. The City watchdog supposedly overseeing the company is now also being investigated .\n\nOn a cheerier note, George explains how teenagers are able to invest on the stock market and how easy it can be to get started, plus a couple of new free share dealing services, an old-fashioned holiday trap and whether insurance companies would pay out if your flash car crash is on video and on social media.", "description": "On this week\u2019s podcast we look at what led to the fraud investigation at London Capital and Finance, where thousands of \u2018savers\u2019 lost millions of pounds.", "authors": ["This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
