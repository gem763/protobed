It was abandoned in 1992 when the men\u2019s European Cup was rebranded as the Champions League.\n\nChange is coming. And fast, as elite men\u2019s clubs invest more to seek quick success in the women\u2019s game.\n\nA group stage, possibly of 16 teams, could soon be introduced by UEFA for the 2021-22 season. The two-team quota per country is set to become three.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for Manchester United, which belatedly fielded a women\u2019s team last year, and Real Madrid, which is currently creating a team in its name.\n\n\u201cWe must \u2026 bring women\u2019s football to the next level,\u201d Andrea Agnelli, the influential Juventus president told members of the European Club Association on Monday.\n\nThe Juventus women\u2019s team - formed only in 2017 - made a Champions League debut on Wednesday, and lost the home leg 2-0 to Barcelona, the beaten finalist last season.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League:\n\nLYON GALACTICOS\n\nWith 13 French league titles in a row, and crowned European champion six times this decade, Lyon is among the most dominant teams in all of sport. Its annual budget is around 8 million euros ($8.9 million).\n\nLyon is anchored in defense by tall captain Wendie Renard and the newly honored UEFA best player in Europe, England left back Lucy Bronze.\n\nThe goals flow from Ballon d\u2019Or winner Ada Hegerberg who, like Renard, scored three in Russia this week. Hegerberg\u2019s refusal to play for Norway at the World Cup in a long dispute with the national federation was part of a strong narrative of women\u2019s soccer seeking greater respect.\n\nThere is no American star in the squad. Alex Morgan got a Champions League winner\u2019s medal in 2017 while on loan in France, and Megan Rapinoe was in Lyon\u2019s 2013 runner-up team.\n\nBALANCED LINEUP\n\nThe Juventus vs. Barcelona and Fiorentina vs. Arsenal games this week contrasted with a Chertanovo vs. Glasgow City pairing unique to women\u2019s soccer.\n\nThe round of 32 features champions from the top 12 domestic leagues and runners-up in the top 10 who qualified directly.\n\nNational champions across the rest of Europe, plus second-place teams from leagues Nos. 11 and 12, entered qualifying groups to decide the other 10 places.\n\nThe broader entry system gave Vllaznia, Breioablik and Mitrovica places. Iceland\u2019s Breioablik beat Sparta Prague 3-2 this week.\n\nNEW NAMES\n\nSome team names may be unfamiliar but show how the women\u2019s game developed in different ways across Europe.\n\nFortuna Hj\u00f8rring from Denmark formed more than 50 years ago as an independent women\u2019s club. It was the 2003 beaten finalist in what was then the UEFA Women\u2019s Cup.\n\nChertanovo, a Champions League debutant, is a state-backed Moscow sports academy dating to the 1970s.\n\nGlasgow City is 21 years old, and stands apart from the historic rivalry of Celtic and Rangers in the city.\n\nFINANCES\n\nUEFA wants the Women\u2019s Champions League to have a separate identity from the men.\n\nLast season, the final was played at the weekend in its own city. From 2010-18, the final was a midweek warmup act for the men\u2019s Saturday final, played in a smaller venue in the same city.\n\nThe next women\u2019s final is on May 24 in Vienna. The men play on May 30 in Istanbul.\n\nVisa is the headline sponsor of European women\u2019s soccer through 2025. That balances Mastercard backing the men\u2019s Champions League since 1994.\n\nNike is designing match balls uniquely for UEFA women\u2019s competitions through the 2021 European Championship. Adidas supplies UEFA\u2019s men\u2019s competitions.\n\nStill, no women\u2019s club is getting rich yet.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Champions League prize fund is 0.25% of the men\u2019s equivalent - just under 5 million euros ($5.5 million) compared to almost 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion).\n\nEach women\u2019s team gets 70,000 euros ($77,000) from UEFA for the round of 32 and typically pays its own travel and hotel costs.\n\nThe title winner next May can count on total prize money of 460,000 euros ($506,000) from UEFA.\n\nBROADCASTING\n\nViewers who tuned in for the Women\u2019s World Cup must search hard to watch these games.\n\nUEFA says broadcast rights belong to the home teams. Its own online streaming service uefa.tv does not have a Women\u2019s Champions League section.\n\nBritish broadcaster BT Sport is committed to England\u2019s Women\u2019s Super League but did not screen live Champions League games of Arsenal and Manchester City this week.\n\nLyon screens live games on the club website, which has a monthly subscription of about $2.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As dominant as the United States in the Women's World Cup, Lyon began the Champions League this week with the brightest ever spotlight on women's soccer in Europe.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Graham Dunbar"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
