I will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool! I'll call you later.\"\n\nThis letter was dated just three days after the White House sent out a statement announcing that the U.S. would pull forces from the region and the Turkish operation would begin. That statement made no objection to the incursion.\n\nThe president has faced bipartisan criticism for the Turkey-Syria conflict, after his decision to pull back U.S. troops ahead of a Turkish operation against U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces.\n\nGeoffroy Van Der Hasselt/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nTrump has since called for a ceasefire and peace settlement. Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien are headed to Turkey to meet with officials there.\n\nMany are weighing in on the letter on social media, with some expressing incredulity at its authenticity, and others expressing concerns for the political ramifications.\n\n\"This Trump letter to Erdogan is the most damaging correspondance that could\u2019ve been leaked ahead of VP Pence\u2019s visit to Ankara tomorrow,\" tweeted Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish Research program at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \"Now, Erdogan has no option but to delay ceasefire in Syria less he be humiliated in front of his nation as weak and bowing to America\u2019s threat.\"\n\nThis Trump letter to Erdogan is the most damaging correspondance that could\u2019ve been leaked ahead of VP Pence\u2019s visit to Ankara tomorrow.
