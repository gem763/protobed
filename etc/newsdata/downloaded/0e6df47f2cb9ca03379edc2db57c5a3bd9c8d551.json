Gemma is a big fan - almost as big as I am.\n\n'We analyse the shows and talk about what we find funny. I'm still finding new things funny about it 40 years later.\n\n'Things remind us of Python all the time, situations we find ourselves in all the time such as she'll ask me a question and I'll reply with Python joke.\n\nPictured, left, a Silly Walks Zone at the wedding venue and, right, 16 tons are suspended over Carol Cleveland in two of many references to Monty Python's Flying Circus\n\n'It's the kind of thing no one else would get - that's why we had to have a Python wedding.'\n\nThe pair tied the knot on Saturday in Sharpthorne, West Sussex, on the 50th anniversary of the show - with 'seventh Python' Carole Cleveland as a surprise guest in the crowd.\n\nJohn and Gemma put thousands of hours in to planning their big day, and included hundreds of props.\n\nInstead of cutting the cake, they squashed it with the 'foot of Cupid', and their top table was decorated with a seven-foot dead parrot.\n\nJohn said: 'I wrote to the Pythons and Carole Cleveland who I had briefly met three times, just letting them know it was happening.\n\n'Michael Palin replied to me directly saying, via his PA, 'Michael is not long out of hospital following a heart-valve operation.\n\n''Michael has seen your message, he wishes you well, and thanks you very much for letting him know.'\n\n'Carol Cleveland asked why I didn't invite her to which I replied 'If you'd like to come, you'd be extremely welcome. We would be honoured.'\n\nPictured: A reference to the Monty Python sketch 'Whizzo Butter', in which a man announces that butter is indistinguishable from a dead crab\n\nUpon arriving at the venue, guests were greeted with this sign, which references a sketch in which a gang of 'Keep Left' signs attack a vicar\n\n'She replied, thanking me but saying she couldn't come, but the next thing I knew, she was there to my utter shock - my mind was blown.'\n\nGemma was told about the website by her uncle and proceeded to sign up and met the love of her life John.\n\nJohn is a father-of-one and was previously married, however felt that his next love should also be a Python fanatic.\n\nWhen it came time to hand over the rings on the big day, the best man was carrying them in a Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.\n\nPictured: An amusing reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail at the wedding of John Wood and Gemma Harris\n\nAnd when the registrar asked if anyone knew of any reason why they couldn't get married, someone replied 'no one expects the Spanish Inquisition.'\n\nThe pair currently live in East Grinstead, West Sussex, and work together running a social media management company.\n\nJohn said: 'Gemma walked down the aisle to the main theme tune of Monty Python in her wedding dress.\n\n'We thought that only about five per cent of the guests would understand all the references, but everybody kept telling us that it was the absolute best wedding they had ever been to.'\n\nA huge neon sign with the words 'Always look on the bright side of life' was erected over the reception.", "description": "John Wood, 59, met Gemma Harris, 35, on the Pythonesque Dating Facebook group - which he set up - and the pair were married in Sharpthorne, West Sussex.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/00/19517334-0-image-a-66_1570665251904.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
