They claimed responsibility for two major suicide bombings in the capital Kabul.\n\nTrump\u2019s surprise announcement left in doubt the future of a draft peace accord worked out last week by Zalmay Khalilzad, the special U.S. envoy for peace in Afghanistan.\n\nUnder the accord some 5,000 U.S. troops would be withdrawn over the coming months in exchange for guarantees Afghanistan would not be used as a base for militant attacks on the United States and its allies.\n\nA full peace agreement to end more than 18 years of war would depend on \u201cintra Afghan\u201d talks involving officials and civil society leaders as well as further agreement on issues including the remainder of the roughly 14,000-strong U.S. forces as well as thousands of other NATO troops.\n\nHowever the Taliban have so far refused to talk to the Afghan government, which they consider an illegitimate \u201cpuppet\u201d regime.\n\nRelated Coverage Elections in Afghanistan becoming more necessary by the hour, says EU special envoy\n\nCIVIL WAR\n\nNine former U.S. ambassadors last week had warned that Afghanistan could collapse in a \u201ctotal civil war\u201d if Trump withdraws all U.S. forces before the Kabul government and the Taliban conclude a peace settlement.\n\nA spokesman for Ghani said Trump\u2019s decision to cancel talks at a time when the Taliban continue to mount attacks proved the concerns expressed by the Afghan government about the deal were acknowledged.\n\n\u201cThe peace talks provided an opportunity to the Taliban to embrace political life,\u201d Sediq Sediqqi told reporters in Kabul.\n\n\u201cWe (the Afghan government) expected an outcome leading to a ceasefire and holding direct talks with the Taliban but we did not see any real effort from their (Taliban) end,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump said on Saturday that he had also planned to meet with Afghanistan\u2019s president, who has been sidelined from the talks, but Sediqqi did not confirm a meeting was planned.\n\nGhani\u2019s office said in a statement it was committed to working together with the United States and allies for a \u201cdignified and long-lasting peace\u201d, and emphasized the holding of the presidential election this month.\n\nGhani is seeking a second tenure in elections scheduled for Sept. 28, but the Taliban want the elections to be canceled as a precondition to signing a peace accord with the Americans.\n\nThe statement said a lasting peace required \u201ca strong, legitimate and a legal government through the upcoming elections to take the ongoing peace process forward.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s strategy of fresh assaults appears to be based on the assumption that battlefield success would strengthen their hand in future negotiations with U.S and Afghan officials.\n\nSome of their field commanders have also said they are determined not to surrender gains when they are close to victory, suggesting the leadership is under internal pressure not to concede a ceasefire.\n\nThe warring sides have held nine rounds of peace talks in Qatar\u2019s capital city Doha aimed at ending America\u2019s longest war, which began with a U.S. invasion triggered by the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in New York, that al Qaeda launched from then Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Afghan presidential candidate Ashraf Ghani speaks during the first day of the presidential election campaign in Kabul, Afghanistan, July 28, 2019. REUTERS/Omar Sobhani\n\nAlmost 4,000 Afghan civilians were killed or wounded in the first half of 2019 in the war against militant groups, including a big increase in the number of casualties caused by government and foreign forces, the United Nations said in July.\n\nWestern diplomats and senior Afghan security experts said the resurrection of talks depends on the Taliban\u2019s stance following Trump\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any particular alternative than negotiations... Nobody wants to go for a bad deal that could pave the way for a civil war,\u201d said Tamim Asey, a former chief of Afghanistan\u2019s intelligence agency.", "description": "Afghan President Ashraf Ghani urged the Taliban on Sunday to end violence and talk directly to his government after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he had canceled a planned meeting with the insurgent group over a draft peace accord.", "authors": ["Hamid Shalizi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427544828&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870B4", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
