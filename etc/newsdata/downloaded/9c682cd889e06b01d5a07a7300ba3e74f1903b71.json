Employment fell in annualised terms in the six months to July 2019 to the greatest extent since early 2012.\n\nWage growth is at a decade-high although the BoE has said it may have peaked and there has been no pickup in productivity.\n\nA measure that BoE policymakers like to look at -- the three-month annualised growth rate of private sector earnings, excluding bonuses -- slowed in July from an almost five-year high of 5.9% in June.\n\n(Graphic: Are cracks appearing in Britain's labour market? https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/621/617/labour1.png)\n\nINVESTMENT\n\nAlthough the Office for National Statistics has revised up the level of business investment in Britain's economy lately, the figures still show capital expenditure has stagnated since the Brexit vote.\n\n(Graphic: Business investment has stagnated since Brexit vote https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/622/618/ibz%20inv.png)\n\nBusiness investment is running about 5 billion pounds lower than it would have been had it followed its pre-Brexit vote trend since the financial crisis, according to the latest data.", "description": "UK economy starts to show cracks under Brexit and global strains", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF970CB_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
