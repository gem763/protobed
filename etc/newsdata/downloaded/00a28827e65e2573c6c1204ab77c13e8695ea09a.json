The deal, along with the 2017 acquisition of Brocade Communications Systems Inc. and the 2018 acquisition of CA Technologies, are part of a big\u2014and costly\u2014bet around infrastructure software.\n\nOn Thursday, Broadcom executives said the company would maintain its dividend policy of paying investors half of its free cash flow from the previous fiscal year but would focus on paying down debt, rather than repurchase shares.\n\n\u201cEspecially in light of the week macro environment we are seeing today,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Thomas Krause said, \u201cwe are conscious of the risk that our levered balance sheet creates and are very focused on managing those risks.\u201d\n\nThrough Aug. 4, when Broadcom\u2019s third quarter ended, the company had generated about $6.88 billion in free cash flow, the money left after paying expenses. Broadcom expects it to reach about $9 billion by year-end, up from $8.25 billion a year earlier.\n\nThe company, based in Silicon Valley, reported third-quarter profit dropped to $715 million, or $1.71 a share, from $1.2 billion, or $2.71 a share, in the same period a year earlier as operating expenses surged 69% to $2.17 billion. Profit from continuing operations rose to $5.16 a share from $4.98 a share a year earlier.\n\nNet revenue rose 9% to $5.52 billion.\n\nAnalysts surveyed by FactSet expected a profit of $1.21 a share, or $5.13 as adjusted, on $5.52 billion in revenue.\n\nGross profit margin improved to 55% from 51.7% a year earlier.\n\nIt was Broadcom\u2019s first financial report since Europe\u2019s top anticompetition regulator opened an investigation into the company, alleging Broadcom wielded its dominance of the market for chips used in modems and television set-top boxes to curtail competition. The European Commission also said it would take the rare step of ordering the company to immediately halt certain practices that it says are anticompetitive, the first time European Union competition authorities have imposed such interim measures in 18 years.\n\nBroadcom has defended its business practices and said it doesn\u2019t expect any material impact from the investigation.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s stock, which has been trading near record levels, closed Thursday at $300.58, up 0.9% for the day.\n\nWrite to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com", "description": "Chip maker Broadcom Inc., hard hit by U.S.-China trade tensions and export restrictions to Huawei Technologies Co., on Thursday said it believes its core semiconductor business has bottomed out but isn\u2019t quite in recovery mode yet.", "authors": ["Maria Armental", "Maria.Armental Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106726/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
