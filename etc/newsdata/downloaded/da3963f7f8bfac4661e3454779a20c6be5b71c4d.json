The type of \"pre-partum depression\" Mitchell describes would be when symptoms appear anytime during pregnancy, according to Martin.\n\nDespite major medical organizations recommending screening for perinatal depression over the past several years, half of all women in the U.S. remain undiagnosed and untreated, studies show.\n\nWomen can be helped though through counseling interventions, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, according to a report released earlier this year by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).\n\nMitchell, who is expecting a girl, did not reveal how or whether she was treated for her depression, but said since announcing her pregnancy, a community of women has lifted her up.\n\n\"I've been fortunate since sharing the news of my pregnancy to have some amazing conversations with other pregnant women and moms and know that all these feelings are 'normal,'\" she said. \"So now we just need to normalize them by discussing more openly.\"\n\nA celebrity like Mitchell -- who started a YouTube channel about her pregnancy -- speaking out about loss and the ups and downs of pregnancy is exactly what is needed to let women know a wide range of emotions is normal, according to Martin.\n\n\"A burden shared is a burden cut in half,\" she said. \"Sometimes when people are isolated and feel alone with either trying to process their pregnancy or a pregnancy loss, just to see a public person being open about it can be really normalizing and reassuring.\"\n\n\"I've been in practice 30 years and this is really different that women are so open,\" Martin added. \"I think it's great that [Mitchell] is speaking out.\"", "description": "Actress Shay Mitchelle discussed having", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/shay-mitchell-gty-jt-191004_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
