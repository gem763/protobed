He calls journalists the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d He rages at the television hosts he watches during his \u201cExecutive Time.\u201d He hasn\u2019t held a traditional White House press conference for almost 10 months, preferring to go around the \u201cfake news\u201d filter he perceives as hopelessly biased and blast out 280-character proclamations on Twitter instead.\n\nYet there\u2019s one form of media President Donald Trump consumes to a surprisingly voracious degree, despite the widespread assumption that he\u2019s not much of a reader: the printed word. At a time when the newspaper industry has lost at least 2,000 jobs nationwide since Trump was elected, and a quarter of its total jobs since 2008, Trump\u2019s ink-stained reading habits are striking.\n\nThey\u2019re also fundamental to understanding his presidency.\n\nIn addition to his diet of major newspapers, Trump relies on paper copies of articles pulled from elsewhere that are culled each day by his staff. The papers and printouts are cherished tools that allow him to monitor the coverage of his administration, reward allies and rebuke critics with dashed-off personal notes.\n\nIt\u2019s also a system that gives aides and would-be influencers ample opportunity to flatter, manipulate and steer him \u2014 and various attempts to exert firmer control over the president\u2019s print inputs have largely failed, according to nearly a dozen current and former officials interviewed for this article.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a fan of the New York Times or the Washington Post but he never misses a day reading them\u201d \u2014 Person close to the White House\n\nThere\u2019s an official process for submitting articles or other material to Trump: Go to the staff secretary\u2019s office for approval and inclusion in his daily reading file \u2014 an inch-or-two thick file folder containing authorized copies of the latest coverage.\n\nBut savvy access-seekers know how to subvert the system.\n\n\u201cIn the Wild, Wild West\u201d era, a current senior White House official recalled, \u201cpeople would put articles on the president\u2019s desk that were things he didn\u2019t need to see, things that were meant to gin him up or get him mad at somebody.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how people stabbed you in the back! They would just walk up to him and say, \u2018Hey. Mr. President, did you see this story in POLITICO? Here\u2019s a copy of it,'\u201d recalled a former senior White House official. \u201cWhen somebody prints something off to hand to him, good or bad, that\u2019s when you knew somebody was out for you. \u2018Hey, how come there\u2019s a copy here of a story from Breitbart?'\u201d\n\nWhen John Kelly became chief of staff, he sought to more rigidly control the president\u2019s sources of information and shut down these unofficial channels, but eventually gave up in frustration.\n\nMick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, has gone through a similar evolution. He was \u201cdisappointed early on\u201d that staffers snuck articles in front of the president that hadn\u2019t been approved, said a current White House official. \u201cHow did he get this?\u201d he would complain.\n\nBut Mulvaney either does not want to or has not tried to revamp the process of getting clips in front of the president, one administration aide noted \u2014 though he has tried to get news coverage to Trump much faster.\n\nUnder Mulvaney, as one senior White House official put it, the process is now \u201clooser [but] in a productive way.\u201d\n\n***\n\nEvery morning before dawn, according to current and former White House officials, Trump has four daily newspapers \u2014 the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post \u2014 delivered to the White House residence.\n\nIn wire photos, Trump body man Nick Luna can be seen walking to Marine One holding newspapers for Trump to read or carrying a legal box full of newspapers, magazines and other printed materials, a vessel often simply known as \u201cthe boss\u2019 papers,\u201d according to a former White House official.\n\nTrump \u2014 who reads newspapers \u201call the time,\u201d per another White House official \u2014 scans the papers for names he knows, especially when the people are quoted.\n\n\u201cIf he wanted them in the morning, that\u2019s great. If he doesn\u2019t, then he has it in his office. If he doesn\u2019t get to it at that point, then we have them on the plane\u201d when he\u2019s traveling, said a current White House official.\n\nTrump \u2014 who reads newspapers \u201call the time,\u201d per another White House official \u2014 scans the papers for names he knows, especially when the people are quoted. When he spots an article he wants to send along, he does not text or email a hyperlink. Instead, he often tears or pulls out the article himself and then directs assistants to put them in the mail once he\u2019s affixed a black-Sharpied note, usually accompanied by his jagged John Hancock.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a fan of the New York Times or the Washington Post but he never misses a day reading them,\u201d said a person close to the White House. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t read them that day, he\u2019ll put them in a box and read them a few days later.\u201d\n\nWhile the staff sleeps on long airplane rides on foreign trips, Trump sometimes stays up and goes through the entirety of four to five boxes of newspapers, magazines and other printed matter, added a senior White House official.\n\n\u201cHe would literally sit on Air Force One for, like, 12 hours and go through stacks of newspapers,\u201d marveled one former senior administration official. \u201cIt was amazing how religious he was about his newspapers.\u201d\n\nBecause Trump doesn\u2019t use a computer or read the news online, the staff secretary\u2019s office prints out the Drudge Report every day to show the president, according to a former White House official.\n\nRepresentative Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a close Trump ally, recalled that he\u2019s been with the president on Air Force One as he read newspapers and signed specific articles, often making notes in the margins before directing them to be sent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very active reader when it comes to circling and underlining or starring things that have gotten his attention,\u201d said Gaetz.\n\nThe president has even been known to sends printouts of tweets he likes. After he liked one Gaetz tweet, he had it printed by a staffer, signed it and requested that it be sent to Gaetz\u2019s congressional office, where the now-framed tweet hangs.\n\n\u201cThe only way he could ever compliment people was to sign a newspaper article, \u2018Great job.\u2019 He\u2019d never compliment you to your face\u201d \u2014 Former Trump administration official\n\nRecalling Trump\u2019s past as a hotelier, Gaetz said, \u201cThis is the proverbial Trump gift basket waiting for you in your suite or sent to you.\u201d\n\n***\n\nPast presidents, from George H.W. Bush with his famous handwritten thank-you notes to Barack Obama and his secure BlackBerry, have used various means of communication to foster relationships and break out of the White House bubble.\n\nTrump wields his daily print clipping ritual as both carrot and stick, praising those who praise him and torching his critics. His outbox is also an internal management tool, a tactic to buck up sagging staff morale during a tumultuous first term.\n\nTo White House staffers and Cabinet members, he\u2019ll send a signed and inscribed copy when a newspaper or magazine article makes even glancingly positive mention of their work. As he reads, Trump will often lightly annotate stories he intends to have delivered internally or entrusted to the postman.\n\nAfter articles Trump signs are \u201ccaptured\u201d for archival purposes and sent to the staff secretary\u2019s office, the task of actually mailing out the clips usually falls to Oval Office operations chief Madeleine Westerhout or Molly Michael, another executive assistant.\n\nStaffers appreciate the praise \u2014 especially because Trump isn\u2019t as effusive in person, several former top officials said.\n\n\u201cThe only way he could ever compliment people was to sign a newspaper article, \u2018Great job.\u2019 He\u2019d never compliment you to your face,\u201d one former senior administration official complained.\n\nWhen Stephanie Grisham was appointed first lady Melania Trump\u2019s communications director in March 2017, she found a signed article about the promotion folded on her chair in her office. Trump had written, \u201cStephanie, you will do a great job!\u201d It\u2019s now framed on her office wall in the West Wing.\n\n\u201cWhen people come in and visit, whether it\u2019s a work meeting or a personal visit, they all happen to notice it,\u201d Grisham, who is now White House press secretary, told POLITICO. \u201cEveryone thinks it\u2019s pretty cool. He\u2019s the president of the United States, but he will still take the time to do these nice little things.\u201d\n\nThe president also has been known to send autographed printouts to members of his Cabinet, to personal friends, and even to the journalists who cover him.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies, earlier this year received several Trump-signed copies of the New York Times when it ran an editorial praising a policy on which they\u2019d agreed, recalled a person to whom Graham has relayed this story.\n\n\u201cGraham\u2019s response was, \u2018What am I supposed to do with these?\u2019\u201d this person said.\n\n***\n\nThe staff secretary\u2019s office is also responsible for Trump\u2019s inbox, in theory: They are supposed to control the flow of articles and op-eds administration officials want the president to see.\n\nTo get stories to Trump, administration officials and others often send articles to top staffers like counselor Kellyanne Conway, Social Media Director Dan Scavino and Westerhout, with the understanding that if merited, links will be forwarded to the staff secretary\u2019s office before being brought to the president\u2019s attention.\n\nThe \u201cvast majority\u201d of articles they forward over to that office wind up placed among his daily documents, according to a White House official.\n\nWhen an article contains contested information, the staff secretary\u2019s office puts that information \u201cinto context\u201d for the president, said the official. It\u2019s also the staff secretary\u2019s job to tell the chief of staff, press team and appropriate policy staffers what Trump is receiving.\n\nThe office will use staff secretary letterhead to simply say, \u201cHere\u2019s an article from so-and-so,\u201d said another White House official. The staff secretary\u2019s team will then put together the articles in a folder that sometimes says \u201creading file\u201d and usually put it with Trump\u2019s briefing book and a schedule that is given to him or sent to the residence every day, according to a former White House official, who said Trump looks at it during his \u201cExecutive Time.\u201d\n\nThe size of the folder, which varies in color, depends on the news of the day but can be \u201cvoluminous\u201d and varies from a quarter-inch to several inches thick of material with more than 50 pages, current and former White House officials say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very effective way to clue him into an issue,\u201d a current White House official said. \u201cOne thing I would do if I was heading up a policy council is feed him a steady diet of information on whatever issue I was keyed up on.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump loves positive coverage, critical pieces hold his attention longer, according to one former senior White House official.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s reverence for print has proven exploitable. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), for instance, has been known to come to meetings with the president carrying hard copies of articles from conservative print publications praising a move he\u2019s made in an effort to sway Trump\u2019s decision-making.\n\nSometimes Trump\u2019s advisers duke it out in his inbox. Top economic aide Larry Kudlow, a free-market evangelist, and hawkish trade adviser Peter Navarro, for instance, will send the president articles to inform and influence him on pending economic issues. Navarro in particular has tried to subvert the normal process, current and former White House officials say. One administration official also said that there\u2019s a perception in the administration that Navarro \u201cfeeds one-sided information to him.\u201d (Navarro declined to comment.)\n\nLike other senior White House officials, Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka has \u201cnever stopped\u201d feeding articles directly to the president, said one person close to the White House, who added that early on in Trump\u2019s tenure, she particularly used to enjoy \u201cbombing people out with newspaper articles.\u201d\n\nA senior White House official denied that, but noted that in the first year of the administration, Ivanka would sometimes share news stories with her father about colleagues she did not think were \u201cconstructive forces for good.\u201d She would point out articles she suspected they had leaked to reporters that were hurting Trump and his agenda \u2014 after which Trump would eventually get rid of her targets, this person said.\n\n***\n\nWhile Trump loves positive coverage, critical pieces hold his attention longer, according to one former senior White House official.\n\nThis habit of the president\u2019s is so widely known internally that officials trying to reach him will sometimes plant both positive or negative items in his favorite outlets to further their own arguments, \u201cknowing that he was a voracious reader of the newspaper,\u201d another former senior official recalled.\n\nLast year, Trump fumed over immigration coverage, often in the Washington Times, that portrayed his administration as ineffective and sluggish. He often sent or mentioned critical stories by the Times\u2019 Stephen Dinan to then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to prod her to act faster.\n\n\u201cIf a story was a negative piece about how efforts at the border weren\u2019t working or how apprehensions were going up or if the numbers were the same under President Obama, the articles would rile him up,\u201d said a former administration official, who relayed that Trump would then call Nielsen to chastise her. If the story struck Nielsen as inaccurate or unfair, she would attempt to calmly explain her view of the situation, this person said.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump became well-known for sending angry notes to journalists who covered him critically. After he didn\u2019t like how the New York Times covered one of his rallies, he fired off a rocket to Maggie Haberman, and then had communications aide Hope Hicks snap a photo of it and zap it over to the Times reporter. (The note said \u201csomething to the effect of, \u2018You wouldn\u2019t know, you weren\u2019t there,'\u201d recalled Haberman, who had been watching the rally on a livestream.)\n\nTrump seems to especially relish sending top officials copies of favorable stories from publications that have criticized him in the past.\n\nWhen she worked at the Wall Street Journal, Janet Hook received an email from a Trump aide early in the 2016 campaign with a note from the candidate complaining about a Journal story she had written about a recent WSJ/NBC poll. \u201cIt was mostly insults about me and the WSJ,\u201d said Hook, now at the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn 2011, Trump annotated a Vanity Fair story by Juli Weiner, circling her name, next to which he wrote in his distinctive scrawl, \u201cBAD WRITER!\u201d (One outside ally of Trump\u2019s, who has often received articles from the president, gently mocked his dramatic penmanship, saying his signature \u201clooks like a richtograph. It looks like a printout of an earthquake. It suggests a lot of inner turmoil.\u201d)\n\nTrump has also continued his decadeslong tradition of sending journalists signed copies of their own articles when he likes a headline. But it\u2019s sometimes clear he hasn\u2019t read the article thoroughly.\n\nThe president sent one such note to National Review editor Rich Lowry, who wrote a New York Post column about Ed Gillespie\u2019s loss in the Virginia gubernatorial race in 2017 \u2014 when Gillespie tried to run away from Trump, but couldn\u2019t. Trump ripped out a copy of the article and drew a big arrow pointing to the headline, \u201cThere Is Only Trump.\u201d He also wrote, in all-caps, \u201cRICH \u2014 SO TRUE,\u201d and signed his name.\n\nTwitter sleuths later determined that Trump must have read the story on a trip to Asia, since the column was clipped from a special version of the Post that is only available in certain hotels. Lowry, who keeps the article on a stack of papers in his office but hasn\u2019t gotten around to framing it, doubts Trump actually fully read his column.\n\n\u201cThe article was not really favorable in many ways,\u201d said Lowry, whom Trump blasted at various points in 2015 as a \u201closer\u201d and \u201cincompetent\u201d who \u201cshould not be allowed on TV.\u201d\n\nTrump seems to especially relish sending top officials copies of favorable stories from publications that have criticized him in the past, including the Weekly Standard, the death of which he celebrated when owner Phil Anschutz shuttered it last December. \u201cSCOTT GREAT STORY \u2014 YOU GET IT!\u201d he wrote to former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt on a Fred Barnes profile of Pruitt (who \u201cwas super proud of his Trump mementos,\u201d according to a former EPA official).\n\nPruitt is hardly unique \u2014 a number of top administration officials, including Mulvaney, make sure to prominently display their missives from Trump in their offices.\n\nEven Trump\u2019s own son-in-law, senior adviser Jared Kushner, has a framed New York Times article from Trump about the president\u2019s proposed trade deal with Canada and Mexico that noted Kushner\u2019s work on the issue.\n\nTrump has also given signed newspaper articles and magazines to former Communications Director Hope Hicks and several signed articles to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, including one Wall Street Journal front page in which Trump encouraged him to get the economy up to 4 percent GDP growth, a framed version of which Mnuchin shows people visiting his office.\n\nTrump has sent signed stories to former chief of staff Reince Priebus, former top economic aide Gary Cohn and former press secretaries Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Sean Spicer as well as senior officials he later scorned, including former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, according to a person who saw the clippings.\n\nWorld Bank President David Malpass also had \u201ca lot\u201d of signed and framed articles in his old office at Treasury, according to someone who\u2019s seen his office. Before he left the White House, chief strategist Steve Bannon had a framed signed front page of the Times that showed Bannon talking to Priebus at CPAC in 2017.\n\n***\n\nIt\u2019s not just newspapers: Trump has long liked to frame articles and magazine covers about himself and loves to brag about how many times he\u2019s been on the cover of Time magazine, for example, even when he gets the number wrong. He\u2019s also been known to hang fake Time covers at multiple Trump properties. In the White House, he will skim through Time, the New Yorker, National Geographic, ESPN Magazine, Golf Digest and many other magazines.\n\nIn his current job, Trump often reads the newspapers while he\u2019s watching television and often seeks feedback from whoever is around him on newspaper stories that are not just about politics, Gaetz said. Knowing Trump\u2019s love of the paper, Gaetz has also adopted the habit of sending stories on a variety of topics to Trump. Trump does the same, Gaetz said \u2014 but hard copies only.\n\nThe intelligence community exploits Trump\u2019s hardwired preference for print as well. Visually arresting infographics and hard copy, high-resolution maps sometimes make their way into the President\u2019s Daily Brief, or PDB, to help Trump comprehend complex national security matters. Intelligence officials know that he best digests complex information when it is coupled with visual aids and laid out on a tactile page, according to an administration official.\n\nNow well into his third year in office, it\u2019s clear the government has adapted to the president\u2019s idiosyncratic reading habits \u2014 rather than the other way around.\n\n\u201cThe unofficial channels of sending the president newspaper articles for all kinds of political purposes never ended. It continues,\u201d one person close to the White House said. \u201cIt\u2019s a practice that has never been able to be halted and will continue on forever. No chief of staff has been able to stop people around Trump handing him articles to try to influence his opinion.\u201d\n\nNancy Cook contributed reporting.", "description": "His newspaper habit is a tool for the president to reward allies and punish foes \u2014 and a weapon for those trying to influence him.", "authors": ["Daniel Lippman", "Miriam Webber", "Eliana Johnson", "Burgess Everett"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1164417447-1200x628.jpg"}
