This is the last thing Xi would want the world to see.\n\nAnalysts say years of complacency by Chinese and Hong Kong governments have played a role. After the Umbrella movement in 2014 failed to pressure Beijing into granting genuine universal suffrage in Hong Kong, apathy pervaded as the pro-democracy movement dwindled. Two years ago, when the Hong Kong government ejected six pro-democracy lawmakers, it managed to pass many unpopular bills. It expected the extradition bill would also be rammed through in June in the same manner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A billboard urges passers-by in Beijing to \u2018Celebrate the Chinese dream together\u2019 ahead of the 70th anniversary.

Many rights have been eroded and the Hong Kong government, which spends heavily on infrastructure and cultural projects to integrate more closely with China, is seen as working for Beijing while undermining Hongkongers\u2019 interests.\n\n\u201cTo the Communist party, the events in Hong Kong signal its failure,\u201d says Jean-Philippe B\u00e9ja, research emeritus professor at the centre for international studies and research at Sciences-Po in Paris. \u201cA generation raised under the red flag not only has not become \u2018patriotic\u2019 as it hoped, but has become increasingly estranged from China.\u201d\n\nNo drones, drinking or dissent: China lays down law ahead of 70th anniversary Read more\n\nHongkongers\u2019 frustrations have exploded into three months of street protests that show no sign of abating. Demonstrations have seen riot police firing teargas, rubber bullets, pepper spray and bean bag rounds at protesters who in turn have thrown petrol bombs, vandalised metro stations and set street fires. Some trampled and burned the national flag.\n\nProtesters call the movement a revolution to \u201creclaim\u201d and \u201cliberate\u201d Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cThe level of anti-China feelings so candidly expressed is new in Hong Kong. In the past it has been cautious; now the young are much more vocal,\u201d says Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. \u201cThis is seen by China as a direct challenge.\u201d\n\nA challenge to Xi\u2019s authority\n\nAnalysts say a catastrophic confrontation is inevitable, because the crisis is essentially the manifestation of a clash of political ideologies.\n\nChina has a completely opposite set of values to those Hongkongers are clamouring for such as democracy, rule of law and basic civil rights. But Xi, who aspires to Mao\u2019s hardline leadership, has been reinforcing the party dictatorship since he came to power in 2012 and does not want to be seen as retreating in front of a mass movement, says B\u00e9ja. \u201cHe has to show the Chinese people that the so-called democratic values result in chaos.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anti-government protesters in Hong Kong on Saturday.

Chinese officials and state media have repeatedly said unaffordable housing and employment issues are the \u201croot cause\u201d of the social unrest. They believe the solution is to ease land supply, cool property prices, and above all, step up economic integration as well as ideological education \u2013 the very elements that have aroused resentment towards China.\n\nThey would rather not touch the \u201csuperstructure\u201d of ideology, political institutions and the state authority, says Wu Qiang, a former politics lecturer at Beijing\u2019s prestigious Tsinghua University. \u201cThey\u2019re not willing to use political solutions or democratic dialogue to resolve problems. It is definitely a clash of political values, and there is no solution \u2026 They don\u2019t understand Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong crisis has posed a challenge to Xi\u2019s authority, especially against the backdrop of the US-China trade dispute. But his position in the party seems unshaken, analysts say.\n\n\u201cInevitably, there are factions in the party that are against him, but unless powerful factions merge to take actions, his position remains unchallenged,\u201d says Ngan Shun Kau, a former editor at pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po.\n\nOfficial Chinese rhetoric casts the Hong Kong protests as incited by \u201cforeign hostile forces\u201d such as the US and the UK to undermine China.\n\n\u201cXi is trying to put the blame on the foreign hostile forces, but his rivals inside the apparatus note that his hard line is not solving the crisis. They might use this failure against him when the opportunity arises,\u201d says Beja.\n\nBeijing quietly extends its grip\n\nWhile the Hong Kong government appears to be adopting a \u201cwait it out\u201d strategy in the hope of a change in public opinion as the protests get increasingly radical and violent, Beijing is quietly bolstering its power in the semi-autonomous city.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, China\u2019s public security minister, or head of police, Zhao Kezhi has recently become a deputy head at the Communist party\u2019s Hong Kong Macau liaison committee, the highest-ranking decision-making body on Hong Kong affairs, according to a report in the pro-Beijing Sing Tao newspaper this month.\n\n\u201cNo one had ever heard of the public security system getting involved in Hong Kong affairs before. This is highly significant,\u201d says Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protest signs on the ground in Hong Kong.

Back in January, while Xi warned about unpredictable risks, Zhao said China\u2019s security forces must prevent and resist \u201ccolour revolutions\u201d that foment regime change.\n\nB\u00e9ja says Zhao\u2019s appointment, which has not been officially announced, means the party regards the Hong Kong crisis as a national security issue and is determined to prevent contagion spreading to the mainland.\n\nWhile the movement has highlighted the huge conflicts between China and Hong Kong, with the protests turning more violent and radical, Beijing will only step up its control on Hong Kong, Cabestan says.\n\n\u201cThe issues at hand are largely unsolvable. The movement has morphed into a democracy movement and Beijing will never give that,\u201d he said. \u201cBeijing will continue to narrow Hong Kong\u2019s political autonomy.\u201d", "description": "Chinese officials blame unrest on issues such as housing or unemployment, but the problems go much deeper than that", "authors": ["Verna Yu"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a97dbc5e46289b81a172b6060d4825ecb65ed5f/0_406_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=036244e282a144e395f56eaa9105c146", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
