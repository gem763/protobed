Ultimately, this is a currency pair that doesn\u2019t know what to do in the short term, but longer-term it\u2019s very likely that we will see a certain amount of negativity as the market participants try to figure out what\u2019s going on with the European Union economy and perhaps even more importantly the Brexit situation which is all over the map. While most traders have been talking about the British pound, the reality is that the Brexit situation affects two currencies, not just Sterling.\n\nEUR/USD Forecast Video 25.09.19\n\nLooking at this chart, the 50 day EMA is above and that should cause quite a bit of noise going forward. With that being the case, it\u2019s very likely that we continue to see a lot of choppiness, but that is quite typical for this pair. Rallies at this point should be faded, but I think it\u2019s short-term at best as far as opportunities are concerned. Ultimately, if the market were to break down below the 1.09 EUR level, then we have the opportunity for traders to take advantage of the longer-term downtrend, perhaps going down to the 100% Fibonacci retracement level which is closer to the 1.0450 level underneath. Obviously, that would be a somewhat big move, but it certainly seems as if that\u2019s where the market is trying to get you over the longer-term.\n\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The Euro has gone back and forth during trading on Tuesday as market participants decide which direction they want to go longer-term.
