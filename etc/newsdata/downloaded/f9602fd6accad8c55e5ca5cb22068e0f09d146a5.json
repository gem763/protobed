Every. Single. Detail.\n\nNew England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is famously intense about his workout regimen and his preparation. He apparently considers everything and had an answer for his team\u2019s 5-0 start this season that you won\u2019t hear every day.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHe appreciates that the Patriots have had a lot of early Sunday starts, because then they can get a proper amount of sleep.\n\nTom Brady enjoys his sleep\n\nBrady sounds like an old man turning in after eating an early-bird special dinner, but he\u2019s aware that sleep helps.\n\nBrady on the @GregHillWEEI Show this morning. Says it\u2019s helped to have as many 1 p.m. games as they\u2019ve had through the first five weeks of the season. Good night\u2019s sleep. Makes it easier to recover, get back to work quickly. \u2014 Phil Perry (@PhilAPerry) October 7, 2019\n\nThat makes a lot of sense. Sports science is big on athletes getting more sleep. The Patriots\u2019 only prime-time game to this point in the season was in Week 1. As the best team in the NFL over the last couple of decades, the Patriots\u2019 play on a lot of Sunday or Monday nights, so the string of 1 p.m. Eastern time starts is a nice respite. That\u2019s assuming all of the younger players are like their 42-year-old teammate, who is a married father of three, and tucked into bed as soon as possible on a Sunday night after a game and not partying after a win. Surely that\u2019s the case.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe string of early starts begins to change with the dreaded Thursday night game this week against the New York Giants, but then the well-rested Patriots get a few extra days before their next game. The Patriots are aware of any edge they can get.\n\nNFL seasons are long\n\nThere\u2019s a reason NFL coaches don\u2019t sleep much.\n\nThe NFL week starts early, no matter if you had a bye, played at 1 p.m. or were on the Monday night game. Game-planning is a week-long thing. That\u2019s not as time consuming of an endeavor for all players, though the quarterback has more on his plate than everyone else.\n\nNFL seasons are grinds, physically and mentally. If a little more sleep early in the season is available, you\u2019re smart to take it. It\u2019s not an angle you think about often, but it also makes sense for Brady to correlate the early starts and the Patriots\u2019 5-0 record.\n\nAnd Brady has played a lot of seasons. He knows by now what works.\n\nTom Brady after the Patriots' 33-7 win at Washington in Week 5.
