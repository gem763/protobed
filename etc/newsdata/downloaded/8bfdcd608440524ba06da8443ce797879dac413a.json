However, a spokesperson for Gates denied to The New Yorker that Epstein directed any contributions from him. Black declined to comment to The New Yorker.\n\nJoi Ito, the lab\u2019s former director who abruptly resigned hours after the report emerged, confirmed to The New Yorker that the lab received $525,000 directly from Epstein. In addition, \u201cIto disclosed that he had separately received $1.2 million from Epstein for investment funds under his control,\u201d Farrow wrote. The sums are much larger than the lab previously acknowledged.\n\nThe depth of Epstein\u2019s involvement in providing donations and directing them was enshrouded in so much secrecy that Ito \u201creferred to Epstein as Voldemort or \u2018he who must not be named,\u2019\u201d Farrow wrote.\n\nEpstein died by suicide at age 66 last month inside his New York City jail cell just before he was set to go on trial for sex trafficking charges involving minors.\n\nDays later, Ito addressed his relationship with Epstein in an apologetic statement, acknowledging that the lab \u201chas received money through some of the foundations that he controlled.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew about these gifts and these funds were received with my permission. I also allowed him to invest in several of my funds which invest in tech startup companies outside of MIT,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his mea culpa, Ito vowed to \u201craise an amount equivalent to the donations the Media Lab received from Epstein\u201d and direct the funds to nonprofit organizations supporting trafficking survivors.\n\n\u201cI will also return the money that Epstein has invested in my investment funds,\u201d he added.\n\nResponding to the latest news on Friday, Time magazine editor Anand Giridharadas announced in a Twitter thread that he was stepping down from his post as a juror for the lab\u2019s Disobedience Award, which presents $250,000 to \u201cindividuals and groups who engage in responsible, ethical disobedience aimed at challenging norms, rules, or laws that sustain society\u2019s injustices.\u201d\n\nThough Giridharadas said the position \u201cseemed like a good idea at first,\u201d he called details of Ito\u2019s ties to Epstein astonishing.\n\nSome time ago, I was asked by Joi Ito, head of MIT's @medialab, to be a juror for its Disobedience Award. I agreed.\n\n\n\nNow I quit.\n\n\n\nThanks to Jeffrey Epstein and the way elite, mostly male networks protect people like him \u2014 and each other.\n\n\n\nLet me explain.https://t.co/WobUHOVmgJ pic.twitter.com/AE2jL9YlZl \u2014 Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) September 6, 2019\n\nNeither M.I.T. nor Ito have publicly responded to The New Yorker\u2019s report.
