They did not always pause to regard me as a curiosity, or something sub-human.\u201d\n\nLast month, on the 56th anniversary of Du Bois\u2019s death, a group of activists, scholars, city officials and residents gathered in front of a new plaque that marks the location of Du Bois\u2019 former residence in Berlin. The young Du Bois, still a student at Harvard at the time, would soon become a leading intellectual and civil rights activist for African Americans and the African diaspora.\n\nEurope would transform his thinking, and he\u2019d leave a legacy that profoundly influenced Europeans fighting racism.\n\n\u201cWe all need models, we need people we can look up to,\u201d said Maithy Moune, a managing director of Each One Teach One, an advocacy organization for black and African people living in Europe. \u201cHe was basically fighting for all of our rights, whether it be Americans, Germans or Europeans.\u201d\n\nBut Du Bois\u2019s reflection on their country also puzzled black Germans attending the ceremony. Many still don\u2019t feel the level of acceptance that Du Bois described more than a century ago. Last weekend, the far-right party Alternative for Germany, or AfD \u2014 whose nationalist rhetoric and imagery frequently targets minority groups living in Germany \u2014 made significant electoral gains in regional elections.\n\nFleeing anger in America, James Baldwin found solace in 1960s Turkey\n\nThat\u2019s worrying to anti-racism activists who fear these political gains may be indicative of a broader trend toward a less tolerant society.\n\n\u201cIn times like these, when migration and flight, or a diverse society are seen as a problem or as a crisis,\u201d said Tahir Della, Speaker for the Initiative for Black People in Germany, \u201cit is important to be clear on what kind of society we want as our reference point, and where we want to go.\u201d\n\nFor the attendees of the ceremony honoring Dubois, his memory evoked comparisons to the types of discrimination faced by black Germans today.\n\n\u201cWe are living in two worlds basically, being foreigners in our own country,\u201d said Moune, who was born in Berlin. \u201cI\u2019m always being asked \u2018how come you are speaking German so well?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re experiencing racism every day,\u201d she added.\n\nFor Du Bois, however, Europe in the late 19th century offered refuge from the United States, a place where he witnessed institutionalized segregation and violence against black people daily. Jim Crow laws brutally oppressed African Americans throughout the South. At the time, at least 100 black Americans were killed every year by lynching, according to the German Historical Museum.\n\nDu Bois had escaped much of that brutality simply by being born in a relatively tolerant Massachusetts. But even in the North, color mattered.\n\n\u201cIt is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one\u2019s self through the eyes of others, \u201d he wrote years later in \u201cThe Souls of Black Folk.\u201d \u201cOne ever feels his two-ness,\u2013\u2013an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two reconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\u201d\n\nWhile in Europe, the 24-year-old Du Bois traveled extensively and felt a veil of separation between color lines lift.\n\n\u201cThe unity beneath all life clutched me,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cI felt myself standing, not against the world, but simply against American narrowness and color prejudice, with the greater, finer world at my back.\u201d\n\nThat world included the brushstrokes of Rembrandt and Titian, the poetry of the German Romantics, the cathedrals of Venice and Rome.\n\n\u201cI saw in the arch and stone and steeple the history and striving of men and also their taste and expression,\u201d Du Bois wrote. \u201cForm, color, and words took new combinations and meanings.\u201d\n\nAn ambitious and talented student at Harvard, Du Bois spoke several languages, including German. In 1892 he won a fellowship to attend the University of Berlin to complete graduate work. The United States was in the midst of post-Civil War reconstruction efforts, and Du Bois was fascinated by Germany\u2019s first chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, who had united Germany\u2019s separate states into a single nation just two decades earlier.\n\nDuring the holidays a German family welcomed him into their home, and their daughter fell in love with Du Bois, and even proposed marriage.\n\n\u201cI became more human; learned the place in life of \u201cWine, Women, and Song,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cI ceased to hate or suspect people simply because they belonged to one race or color.\u201d\n\nPart of the acceptance he found in Germany may be due to his privilege, according to Marianne Bechhaus-Gerst, a professor of African studies at the University of Cologne. \u201cWhen confronted with a person of Du Bois\u2019s standing, white people in Berlin acted differently,\u201d she said.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t mean racism didn\u2019t exist in Germany and across the continent. Anti-Semitism was commonly taught at major universities, and Berlin had also been instrumental for ushering in a new era of heightened imperialism and brutality abroad. Just seven years before Du Bois arrived, Bismarck had organized the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 and formalized Europe\u2019s scramble for Africa.\n\nIn Europe\u2019s universities, racist theories about \u201cminor races\u201d were being developed by scientists. The theories would travel to the United States and help justify Jim Crow laws. Those laws, in turn, were later studied by colonialists and the Nazis to implement and maintain the brutality of colonial rule and the Holocaust.\n\nThey also helped underpin the violence of the 20th century\u2019s first genocide. In what is now Namibia, German troops shot, starved, and tortured tens of thousands of Herero and Nama people to death. Hundreds of thousands more died in the Maji Maji revolt in German East Africa, in present-day Tanzania.\n\nAt the time of his stay in Berlin, Du Bois could not recognize the structures and thinking underlying the violence.\n\n\u201cHe was 24 and for him imperialism and colonialism was a sort of normality that he was working himself out of,\u201d said Martin Klepper, a professor of American Studies at the Humboldt University in Berlin. \u201cHe came back to the states and then he became really much more critical than he had ever been of colonialism and imperialism and racism.\u201d\n\nIn fact, after his return to the U.S., Du Bois vehemently denounced colonialism, and wrote extensively about what he saw as a common origin for the violence he saw at home and abroad. \u201cThe problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line \u2014 the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea,\u201d he wrote in \u201cThe Souls of Black Folk.\u201d\n\nFor many Germans, the same can be said of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWe have a big problem in Germany that we are not really talking about black history, we are not really addressing the issues of racism, colonialism, and so on,\u201d said the activist Moune.\n\nGermany\u2019s colonial history receives only a brief mention in most school curriculums, and discussions around discrimination against black Germans and other minorities have historically been overshadowed by the country\u2019s reckoning with the Holocaust.\n\n\u201cBut there was always systemic racism in Germany and it still is,\u201d said Bechhaus-Gerst. \u201cAnd it was always important for the self constructing an identity as a white society to have these \u2018others,\u2019 whether they are black people or whether they\u2019re Muslim.\"", "description": "Europe would transform his thinking, and he\u2019d leave a legacy that profoundly influenced Europeans fighting racism.", "authors": ["Luisa Beck", "Reporter Covering Europe The Washington Post'S Berlin Bureau"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7AAZVZWOLQI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
