It is not clear what friend Parnas was referring to.\n\n\u201cWe are confident,\u201d Parnas, told the newspaper, \u201cAmerica wants a change.\u201d The newspaper described Parnas as an insurer. (Parnas co-founded a company, Fraud Guarantee, that at some point retained Giuliani as a lawyer.)\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/5b/48/9e2282cc4bdc8f056865e09c54f9/artboard-1.png\"\n\nThe new detail connecting Trump and Parnas at the same election night party in November 2016 raises fresh questions about the president\u2019s insistence that he doesn\u2019t know the Ukrainian-born businessman. It comes amid a rapidly unspooling investigation that appears headed for a House vote to impeach the president. On Thursday, Democrats probing Trump\u2019s outreach to Ukrainian officials seeking an investigation into his political opponents sent subpoenas to both Parnas and his Florida-based partner, Igor Fruman, just hours after DOJ unsealed its indictments against the two businessmen.\n\nJohn Dowd, who represents both men, also confirmed in a letter to Congress earlier this week that his clients were assisting Giuliani \u201cin connection with his representation of President Trump\u201d \u2014 a partnership that the former New York mayor openly said was about pressing for help in Kiev that would undercut the 2020 Democratic front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nBack in 2016, Hillary Clinton\u2019s thousands-strong extravaganza at the Javits Center on election night drew a sharp contrast with Trump\u2019s election night event, which was relatively cozy and where die-hard supporters barely outnumbered the throngs of media on hand.\n\nGiuliani attended the same party, as did Felix Sater, a former executive at the Trump Organization who had a double life as a convicted criminal and a high-level cooperator for the CIA. Sater, who told POLITICO earlier this month that he knows Parnas, said Friday that he did not interact with him at the party.\n\nGiuliani, who is reportedly facing investigative scrutiny himself for his dealings with Parnas and Fruman, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump on Thursday tried to distance himself from Parnas and his business partner. \u201cI don\u2019t know those gentleman,\u201d the president told reporters before boarding Marine One en route to a campaign rally in Minneapolis. \u201cMaybe they were clients of Rudy. You\u2019d have to ask Rudy.\u201d\n\nParnas posted a photo of himself with Trump at the White House on May 1, 2018, with a caption describing an \u201cincredible dinner and even better conversation,\u201d according to a screenshot captured by The Campaign Legal Center. Another picture Parnas posted from May 21, 2018, shows him with Fruman and Donald Trump Jr. in Beverly Hills, with the caption \u201cPower Breakfast!!!\u201d\n\nTrump dismissed the photos \u201cbecause I have a picture with everybody.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Put it that way. I just remember bringing people in there with me. It was not the most challenging event to get into.\u201d\n\nJason Miller, who worked as communications director for the 2016 campaign, said he was unaware of Parnas\u2019 presence at the event. \u201cI was with the president up on stage that night,\u201d he told POLITICO. \u201cI was not mingling with attendees early in the evening.\u201d\n\nParnas, 47, was arrested Wednesday night along with Fruman, as they tried to leave the country, and indicted over alleged schemes to purchase political influence on behalf of foreigners.\n\nDowd, the lawyer, said he did not know about his client\u2019s presence at the November 2016 Trump party. Asked whether he could check with Parnas about it, Dowd responded, via text message: \u201cHe is in the slammer. Get real.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/72/00/57914ceb464da08651b0daa39708/191011-giuliani-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
