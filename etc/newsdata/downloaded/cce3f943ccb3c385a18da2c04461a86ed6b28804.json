He broke into a grin. A big, sloppy grin of pure delight, tongue lolling lazily to the side of his mouth, an infectious happiness that spread throughout the English ranks in Oita.\n\nIt was the defining image of a quite remarkable day, a victory over Australia more emphatic than even Eddie Jones might have hoped, the greatest points total England had amassed in a Rugby World Cup knock-out game.\n\nAnd there was Sinckler at the heart of it all. When he infringed early on, a short spell when Australia were in the ascendancy, and Silatolu Latu patted his head patronisingly, Sinckler didn\u2019t even flinch, much less snarl. \u2018I felt so focused on doing my job I didn\u2019t really notice it,\u2019 he said, \u2018whereas six months ago that would really have riled me up.\u2019\n\nKyle Sinckler displayed a big grin as he rampaged past the Australia defence to score a try\n\nAt the start of this year, for all his talent, Sinckler\u2019s temperament was viewed as a point of weakness in the England team. \u2018An emotional time bomb,\u2019 Warren Gatland called him before England visited Wales in February. It would have hurt even more because Gatland had picked him for the British and Irish Lions.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just a random insult. And when Sinckler was hastily removed from that game for conceding two quick penalties before grabbing Alun Wyn Jones around the neck, the prophecy was fulfilled. England went on to lose without him and Gatland was proven right. Sinckler was a ticking device. Sinckler could go off and destroy all around him.\n\n\u2018If I\u2019m being honest, the Wales game taught me a lot,\u2019 Sinckler said. \u2018I let the team down, I let my country down. If we had won that match we would have been Grand Slam champions. I had to look within and just work on that side of my game.\n\nIt was the prop's first try for his country and came at just the right time in the Rugby World Cup\n\n\u2018A sign of toughness isn\u2019t what you say to the opposition or how you react with handbags or whatever. It\u2019s your next action and that\u2019s something I\u2019ve tried to really, really improve.\n\n\u2018I know my behaviour in the past has cost the team and I didn\u2019t want to feel like that again. I had to look within and help myself. I feel like I\u2019ve definitely done something \u2014 I hope you guys have seen a change. It\u2019s working for me, but it\u2019s been tough.\u2019\n\nSinckler is talking harsh self-analysis and reflection, questions not about rugby but about his life, his upbringing, his circumstances, where that anger came from and why it manifested itself even when he was playing the sport he loves.\n\n\u2018I feel I\u2019ve always been quite a frustrated guy,\u2019 Sinckler revealed.\n\nThe 26-year-old has a reputation for being a hothead and liability for his country\n\nWales coach Warren Gatland labelled Sinckler an 'emotional timebomb' earlier this year\n\n\u2018Rugby is my canvas. I\u2019ve always expressed myself through it, like my outlet. So I\u2019ve had to deal with a lot of things I was frustrated about in my life and address them. I\u2019ve been working really hard with someone to look at those things off the field, things that happened in my childhood. And then once I got a better understanding of that stuff I had no frustrations; I could just go out and play.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been working with a guy called Ollie Pryce-Tidd, who is at an organisation called Saviour World. He\u2019s done a lot of work with James O\u2019Connor, the Australian player. It\u2019s probably nothing to do with rugby really. My frustrations were not rugby-related.\n\n\u2018I was born in a single-parent home. I was always looking for that male father figure. Subconsciously, I put people in that position, put my trust in certain people who betrayed me really. It was just about me taking control of my life and teaching me how to be an actual man. A man is in control of his emotions, a man looks after his family, he does the right things. He doesn\u2019t let anything that frustrates him show. He just gets on with it.\n\n\u2018Where I\u2019m from there\u2019s a big onus on me to set a good example and be a role model and show what being a man is. A man isn\u2019t losing your rag, your emotions, showing your opponent how you might really feel. It\u2019s about being calm, being disciplined, putting the team first, doing your job and not allowing your ego to take control. I\u2019ve taken a step back rather than being in people\u2019s faces these days.\u2019\n\nSinckler was sent off for grabbing the shirt of Alun Wyn Jones in this year's Six Nations\n\nSaviour World is not a typical refuge for rugby types. Conditioning and fitness is important but it\u2019s very new age in its approach otherwise: sitting half naked in circles, breathing exercises, cider vinegar drinks and promises of \u2018knowledge for men\u2019.\n\nAustralian back O\u2019Connor was on a downward spiral \u2014 removed from a plane to Perth by police for being drunk, arrested on suspicion of trying to buy cocaine in Paris \u2014 and he credits Saviour World with turning his life around. Danny Cipriani has also featured in the group\u2019s videos, and Pryce-Tidd uses unconventional techniques including sensory deprivation, heat exhaustion and deep states of meditation to force his clients to confront uncomfortable truths.\n\nThat certainly seems to be the case with Sinckler, who spoke after Saturday\u2019s game in a way that confirmed his growing maturity. He could be a hugely important figure in English rugby, a potential Raheem Sterling, a spokesman for his generation.\n\nSinckler is from Furzedown, near Streatham, a part of south London that is hardly a rugby hotbed. It\u2019s not the slums \u2014 Sadiq Khan, the London Mayor, is a resident, and Labour\u2019s shadow sports minister Rosena Allin-Khan is the MP \u2014 but two miles away is Deeside Road in Wandsworth, where 18-year-old Cheyon Evans was fatally stabbed in June.\n\nSinckler says his change in behaviour is due to help from an organisation called Saviour World\n\nSinckler\u2019s first sport, like most kids from the area, was football, but a tendency towards extreme physicality and the fights that often resulted drove his mum, Donna, a worker at a police call centre, to seek out a local rugby team.\n\nBattersea Ironsides do not have a long list of alumni who made it into the national team. Many weeks, Sinckler has said, they had to borrow players from the opposition to get out a starting XV. Now it has one of the busiest youth sections in the country due, in part, to Sinckler\u2019s influence.\n\nThat IS his personal mission at this tournament, away from the team ambitions: to emerge as a figure that could inspire the next generation, the way his imagination was fired by the 2003 World Cup-winners.\n\nThe group have also helped troubled Australian star James O'Connor for a number of problems\n\nSinckler admits wanting to be Jason Robinson, looking in the mirror, and settling on Jason Leonard instead. Yet, for a prop, he has good hands and, as he showed on Saturday, an explosive burst of pace. Eddie Jones compared him to a charging rhino, and they\u2019re pretty swift when they get going.\n\nSinckler matters because he is the player who proves he doesn\u2019t need the right school, or family connections, to make it to rugby\u2019s summit.\n\nEqually, his rise has been as slick as his feet, moving on to that pass from Owen Farrell. When a local journalist asked him if England\u2019s victory was revenge for the Australian defeat that eliminated them at the last tournament, his self-deprecating answer revealed how far he has come. \u2018Not really for me, it wasn\u2019t,\u2019 he said. \u2018I wasn\u2019t involved then. I was third-choice prop at Harlequins at the time so it made no difference. I was in a pub watching the game with Adam Jones.\u2019\n\nNow he is front and centre in England\u2019s first semi-final since beating France in 2007. His sense of duty reaches far beyond overcoming the All Blacks. \u2018I feel like I\u2019ve got a real big responsibility for the team and the people watching back home, especially people where I come from,\u2019 Sinckler said.\n\nFor now, Sinckler is aiming to help inspire the next generation with another World Cup triumph\n\n\u2018My mission is to inspire the next generation the way the 2003 generation inspired me. I remember watching them and Jonny Wilkinson kicking that goal and it made me want to play rugby and be on that stage. It\u2019s a matter of having a responsibility to the grassroots and people from my background.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s all about belief. A lot of people, when I was growing up, said I couldn\u2019t do a lot of things, that I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything. I was lucky to have a good family around me, a good group of friends who supported me and steered me in the right direction. They were good role models. Look at the stuff that\u2019s happening around London with knife crime. It\u2019s just because kids are bored, they\u2019re sitting around.\n\n\u2018When I was a kid I had training, I was playing football, rugby, cricket, I was at kick-boxing, karate, I didn\u2019t have time to think about doing something bad.\u2019\n\nSinckler smiles. The grin we all recognise now, from the back pages, from the television highlights. It\u2019s the smile of a man at last happy in his own skin. Still emotional, still passionate, but no longer a time bomb.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s nice if people are thinking of me like that,\u2019 he said, \u2018but I think I could have played better, I think I could have contributed more. For me, it\u2019s: cool, good game, and enjoy this moment, because it could all be over in a second.\u2019", "description": "MARTIN SAMUEL: It was the defining image of a quite remarkable day, a victory over Australia more emphatic than even Eddie Jones might have hoped, the greatest points total England had amassed.", "authors": ["Martin Samuel - Sport For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/19/19962972-0-image-a-12_1571597352760.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
