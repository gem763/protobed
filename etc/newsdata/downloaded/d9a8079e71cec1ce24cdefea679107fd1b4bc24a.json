However, signs of weakness have started appearing lately \u2014 including a slowdown in the pace at which home prices have been rising.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the housing market is headed for a crash. But some places could be more at risk of a downturn than others. To identify those places, GOBankingRates evaluated 500 cities to identify which ones have high rates of foreclosures and underwater mortgages (houses that are worth less than what is owed). GOBankingRates also looked at changes in median home listing prices, the number of days homes are on the market and percentage of for-sale listings with price cuts and compared those figures with national averages to see which housing markets were lagging behind the nation as a whole.\n\nFlorida has the highest number of cities with real estate markets that could be in trouble, followed by Illinois. Keep reading to see which cities in these and other states have housing markets that are turning ugly.\n\nHouse prices are dropping in this city in southwest Florida. While home prices nationwide have climbed an average of 9.4% over the past two years, prices have dropped 1.4% in Fort Myers over the same period. Plus, houses for sale spend 105 days on the market in Fort Myers, on average, compared with a national average of 66 days.\n\nThe percentage of underwater mortgages in this city in southeastern Virginia near Virginia Beach is more than double the national average of 8.2%. However, the real estate market here hasn\u2019t turned too ugly yet. In fact, the percentage of listed home with price cuts in Newport News \u2014 12.6% \u2014 is lower than the national average of 17.5%.\n\nHome prices still are rising in this suburb of Atlanta \u2014 but not nearly as much as the national average. In fact, home prices in Cumming increased an average of just 0.7% over the past year. And 21.8% of listed homes here have seen price cuts compared with a national average of 17.5%.\n\nHome price growth has slowed over the past year in this western Ohio city on the banks of Lake Erie. However, the bigger problem here is the high percentage of underwater mortgages \u2014 which is about three times the national average. Plus, the number of foreclosed homes is higher than the national average.\n\nThis Chicago suburb has made it onto plenty of \u201cbest places to live\u201d lists. However, the housing market has been slumping here. Home prices have dropped more than 2% over the past two years. And at 26.4%, Naperville has the highest percentage of listed homes with prices cuts of any city on this list.\n\nSouth of Tampa on Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast, Sarasota has a real estate market that could turn ugly. Home price growth has slowed. Houses for sale are sitting on the market for an average of 99 days, far longer than the national average of 66 days. On top of that, the foreclosure rate is higher in Sarasota than it is nationwide.\n\nThe current housing market is slumping in this tourist destination about 30 miles north of Miami. Home prices in Fort Lauderdale have fallen in the past two years. And the average number of days houses stay on the market here \u2014 133 \u2014 is double the national average.\n\nThis city in Southern California is part of the Los Angeles metro area. The median home price in Menifee is well above the national median. However, the housing market here could be headed for trouble. Menifee has the third-highest foreclosure rate among cities on this list.\n\nHome to the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa has a higher percentage of homeowners with negative equity than the nation as a whole. Nearly 12% of mortgages are underwater here compared with about 8% nationwide. The foreclosure rate also is slightly higher in Tuscaloosa than the average across the U.S.\n\nThe percentage of foreclosed properties in Delaware\u2019s largest city is twice as high as the national average. And the percentage of underwater mortgages in Delaware is almost double the percentage nationwide.\n\nThe housing market has been slowing in this city on Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast. While home prices nationwide have climbed 9.4%, on average, over the past two years, they\u2019ve fallen 8.8% in Naples over the same period. And the average number of days that homes are on the market here \u2014 140 \u2014 is more than double the national average.\n\n39.

In fact, Plainfield has the second-highest percentage of listed homes with price cuts at 25.3%.\n\n36.

Each city was given a score based on how many of the eight factors they had that were worse than their respective U.S. average figures. For instance, if a city had a percentage of \u201cunderwater\u201d mortgages that was greater than 8.2% (the U.S. average), then this city for this factor is worse than the U.S. average. All factors were scored, added together and ranked.
