I\u2019ve decluttered. I\u2019ve bid whole charity shops\u2019 worth of clothes \u201cgoodbye\u201d with a vote of thanks. I\u2019ve rested my socks and folded pants into tiny little packages.\n\nSo naturally, I couldn\u2019t wait to get my hands on The Lean and Happy Home: 7 easy ways to create order in your family and find joy and calm at home by former journalist Eva Jarlsdotter. She isn\u2019t Japanese \u2013 she\u2019s Swedish \u2013 but the methods she espouses are based on management techniques first developed at Toyota. There\u2019s endless jargon-filled literature on Lean but in brief it\u2019s about creating a management and organisational culture in which every employee works to maximise customer value and minimise waste by examining manufacturing \u201cstreams\u201d. Jarlsdotter believes it could work at home too.\n\nShe explains: \u201cIn the family and in the home, we are hard on one another\u2019s love, trust and self-esteem; we put a strain on the environment and on ourselves, and many people waste resources \u2013 both time and money. Lean curtails that wastefulness. Persistent work with Lean can dramatically reduce waste and create a more sustainable, harmonious home \u2013 and ultimately, a more sustainable society ... Lean is about keeping an eye on every stream, and recognising what truly creates value, and what is pure waste. It\u2019s about untangling all the knots to create smooth and easy processes.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nShe gives as an example her own family\u2019s approach to laundry. Pre-Lean, the \u201cstream\u201d via which a piece of dirty clothing got from being cast off on to the Jarlsdotters\u2019 floor to being back in the wardrobe clean and pressed had become so convoluted and took so long that on several occasions Jarlsdotter\u2019s children grew out of clothes before they were ready to wear again.\n\nJarlsdotter was wasting time looking for clean clothes and wasting money buying new ones when she couldn\u2019t find them. The solution? Do the laundry as soon as it needs doing. That\u2019s what I took away from the chapter anyway, all the time feeling slightly itchy that anyone could let laundry get so out of control that it took a whole month in the first place. But then I don\u2019t have children.\n\nReading the book, it became increasingly clear that you\u2019ll get the most dramatic results from being a Lean-style manager about the house if you have minions. For which, read offspring. Fortunately, I was able to borrow one of my sister\u2019s for the purposes of this column.\n\nI finished reading Lean and Happy Home ahead of a week\u2019s self-catering holiday in Dorset with my seventy-something mum and 14-year-old nephew. It was the perfect opportunity to put Lean to the test. I warned them in the car that in the interests of research, I would be implementing \u201cLean and Happy Holiday Home\u201d for the next seven days. Mum couldn\u2019t hear me from the back seat. Nephew had his head-phones on. When he did hear what I wanted to do however, nephew immediately embraced the concept of the \u201cFive Whys\u201d, which Jarlsdotter recommends for getting to the bottom of any issue. Why does the laundry take a month? Because we\u2019re disorganised. Why are we disorganised? Etc Etc.\n\n\u201cWhy do we have to have a holiday according to some self-help book?\u201d My nephew and I only got to three \u2018whys\u2019 before we reached the traditional \u201cbecause I said so\u201d.\n\nLean is complicated. There are five principles, eight \u201cwastes\u201d and heaven only knows how many buzz words. Fortunately, Jarlsdotter distils her wisdom into a few actionable actions (that\u2019s my management speak) that you can start working on straight away. Number one is: \u201cHave your first Kanban Meeting with the entire family.\u201d Kanban is \u201cvisual planning\u201d. In the Jarlsdotter family, it involves a white board, upon which the week ahead\u2019s appointments, chores and plans are scrawled. Over supper on the first evening, I called my family together around a white note-pad.\n\nRegarding Kanban, Jarlsdotter suggests: \u201cIf Lean at home is about how to create the life you live together at home, then you need to know just what kind of life you want to live. Think about your dreams and what you consider a good home and a good day-to-day life.\u201d\n\nIf Lean at home is about how to create the life you live together at home, then you need to know just what kind of life you want to live Eva Jarlsdotter\n\nI know I consider a good holiday to be one where I don\u2019t have to think about the next meal because someone else is cooking it. On a self-catering trip however, there was to be no getting out of the cooking so I hoped that at least knowing what we planned to eat on a daily basis would reduce the faff. We brainstormed some menus and compiled a list of groceries.\n\nThe following morning, my nephew and I headed to the supermarket. We left the shopping list on the kitchen table. It turned out not to be a problem since the supermarket nearest our holiday home was clearly not practising \u201cLean\u201d. Rather it was practising \u201cHard Brexit\u201d. When we arrived at half nine, the shelves were alarmingly empty and what remained had already been opened.\n\n\n\nThree boxes of Ritz Crackers had the tops torn off. The lone box of GU chocolate melting middle puds had been fiddled with. I picked up a packet of smoked salmon, saw the rip in the wrapper, and swiftly put that back too. We grabbed whatever looked tamper-proof. Before we even got to the checkout with three boil-in-the-bag baguettes and a firmly-sealed tube of Pringles, we\u2019d decided to go out for lunch. But at least our first foray into Lean gave us a very real demonstration of the difficulties of being a manufacturer relying on \u201cjust in time\u201d delivery of components.\n\nJarlsdotter\u2019s second suggestion is that a Lean family should calculate its environmental footprint using the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s website. We couldn\u2019t get online for long enough but, luckily, our holiday home owners had placed a meter showing the house\u2019s energy consumption in a prominent spot in the kitchen so we were able to see in real time just how unsustainable we were being. We spent \u00a31.89 on electricity before breakfast.\n\nThe visual reminder that \u201cenergy is money\u201d worked. We got so diligent about switching the lights off every time we exited a room that when my nephew turned the stair lights off at the top while I was simultaneously switching them off at the bottom, we fused the entire house. Taking an hour to find the fusebox meant we saved an hour\u2019s worth of electricity at least.\n\nThirdly, Jarlsdotter suggests you attach a sheet of white paper to the refrigerator, with two columns. She writes, \u201cLabel one STOP DOING. Label one TO SELL/DONATE.\u201d Our first column had a single request. \u201cStop farting\u201d. Column two was empty. Much as we all hated the draft excluder that looked like a badly stuffed Maine Coon, we couldn\u2019t really throw it out. It would have come out of our deposit.\n\nJarlsdotter\u2019s last suggestion is that you \u201cstart having a Clean-o-rama\u201d. Clean-o-rama is a jolly hour in which everyone engages in a whirlwind of housework, after which family members rate each other\u2019s efforts and then indulge in a family reward. Assuming they haven\u2019t killed each other over poorly-rated dusting skills first.\n\nI planned a Clean-o-rama for our last morning but the idea was met with short shrift. \u201cWe\u2019ve paid all this money to stay here. I don\u2019t see why we\u2019ve got to strip the beds as well,\u201d said Mum. She had a point. We keep hearing how Brexit has sent the cost of foreign holidays soaring. It seems to me that it\u2019s still cheaper for a British family to spend a week at the Hotel Du Cap-Eden-Roc than it is to spend a week in a cottage in Dorset with bobbly sheets, a blocked bathroom basin and no toaster. We binned Clean-o-rama in favour of a last game of pool on the tiny table in the attic where we\u2019d spent much of the week.\n\nJarlsdotter explains that one of the most important tenets of Lean is \u201cHansei\u201d, which means reflection and learning. At the end of my Lean Holiday with Mum and Nephew Number Two, I looked back over what I\u2019d learned during the past seven days. Truth was, I\u2019d abandoned \u201cLean\u201d to preserve the \u201cHappy\u201d.\n\n\n\nIn a more traditional family situation, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s worth persevering through the problems and protests to create a smooth and sustainable family life. The savings in time, money and space Jarlsdotter describes at the end of her book are impressive and considerable and I admire her application. I might have tried harder myself but ultimately I knew I would be dropping Mum and Nephew off at the week and returning to a home where the laundry gets done and the pants are always neatly folded, Marie Kondo-style.\n\n\u2018The Lean and Happy Home\u2019 is published by Yellow Kite Books, \u00a312.99", "description": "As an early adopter of Marie Kondo\u2019s KonMari method as outlined in her international bestseller The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up, I\u2019ve long been convinced of the joy of Japanese lifestyle hacks.
