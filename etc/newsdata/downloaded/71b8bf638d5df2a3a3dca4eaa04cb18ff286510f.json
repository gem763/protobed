Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.\n\nTo begin, let\u2019s go to the end of Anthony Trollope\u2019s The Prime Minister, the final book in the Palliser series, as reviewed by capedoctor:\n\nWith a central theme of 19th century British political life and intrigue, the resonance with current political chaos is astonishing. Although there is no resemblance whatsoever between the eponymous prime minister and Mr Johnson, the smooth journey of landed gentry into political office, the transience and superficiality of political alliances and the jealous protection of self-interest and patronage seems not to have changed much in 150 years. Added to this are Trollope\u2019s eloquence as a writer, his power of understatement on crucial social and political issues and so many other reasons why I personally keep going back to the great Victorian novels.\n\nTwo views on The Dutch House by Ann Patchett. LLCoolJ writes:\n\nIn a nutshell: it\u2019s not her best, but it was still supremely satisfying to read, and I find myself still thinking it about it a week after finishing, which doesn\u2019t always happen with any author. But even a less-than-perfect Patchett is better than lots of stuff, and I\u2019m very glad I read it.\n\nAnd Cardellina has also been enjoying it:\n\nI haven\u2019t read a Patchett novel before (although \u201cBel Canto\u201d has lingered on my informal \u201cto read\u201d list for a while), and I bought it purely on the strength of its ludicrously gorgeous cover (always a risky move - I\u2019ve been burned before). So far it has been the perfect book for being curled up under a blanket with a gross cold.\n\nCountry by Michael Hughes has impressed fingerlakeswanderer:\n\nA retelling of the Iliad but set in 1996 Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Achill is a sniper with the IRA who chooses to sit out his cohort\u2019s raid on a local army base. He\u2019s furious because he has been personally betrayed over a relationship, and he refuses all entreaties to change his mind, especially those from his friend, Pat. Henry is a British soldier who first fought in the Falklands, and now he\u2019s been sent to Northern Ireland. Everything leads to the consequences of Pat\u2019s refusal to fight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m currently reading and enjoying (if that\u2019s the word) Julian Barnes\u2019s The Only Story,\u201d says scarletnoir:\n\nBarnes is on top form here, telling a tale where the protagonist is roughly the same age as himself, and starting when the young man (19) falls in love with Susan (48). Every word is chosen with care, and the writing is top class.\n\n\u201cI am re-reading Alan Booth\u2019s Looking For The Lost in advance of a hiking trip to Japan starting next week,\u201d says greenmill:\n\nAlthough I won\u2019t see the Japan that Booth travelled through or have the level of engagement with local people in remote rural areas that he did (he was a fluent Japanese speaker whereas I have got to the heady heights of evening college level 2), Booth\u2019s beautiful prose which is alternately elegiac and comedic, remains an inspiration for my coming travels. His early death robbed us of a gifted travel writer whose love for his subject is burned into every page.\n\nFinally, rgilyead has found plenty to recommend The Testaments by Margaret Atwood:\n\nAtwood\u2019s ideas about Gilead have obviously been maturing for many years, helped, as she acknowledges, by feedback from readers and the opportunity to work on the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. This book is so rich in subtle details. I felt that the TV series, by making her horrific vision visible, actually diminished the impact of the story. She has an incredible, almost offhand, way of suggesting the horrors that have taken place. This book explores how Gilead came to exist and the insidious way in which precious freedoms were lost. The testaments of the three principal characters interleave to build up the picture of the rise of the theocracy and the bravery of the women who fought it. I think the book is a stunning achievement. Margaret for the Nobel, I say!\n\nSounds like a plan. (The Nobel winners will be announced on Thursday.)\n\nInteresting links about books and reading\n\nIf you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #GuardianBooks, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog.
