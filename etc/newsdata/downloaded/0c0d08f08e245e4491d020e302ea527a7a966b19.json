Made from concentrated apple juice instead of bee spit, the new product is due to be available in 100 stores from 16 September.\n\nThe honee is made by Herbivore, a husband-and-wife team in Cape Town that also supplies Woolworths with kale chips, mushroom biltong, and date balls.\n\nFinding an alternative to honey, which is essentially bee spit, was next on the agenda, said Grantham.\n\n\u201cHoney is essentially a food source for the bees,\u201d said Grantham. \u201cThe population of bees is declining and yet the demand for honey is going up we\u2019re giving people an alternative.\u201d\n\nBut replicating honey isn't easy.\n\nBees store nectar in an extra stomach, where it mixes with enzymes. When they return to the hive, they regurgitate the nectar into the mouth of another bee, a process that continues until honey is finally deposited into honeycomb.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see if honee could pass for the real thing, Business Insider South Africa conducted a blind taste test with 10 sweet-toothed journalists.\n\nThe overwhelming reaction from our tasters was that the honee was too sweet and tasted somewhat like apricot jam.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sweet. It tastes like a toffee syrup, but also with a hint of apricot jam,\u201d said one participant.\n\nOther participants said it has a \u201csharp, sour taste\".\n\n\n\n70% of our tasters said they would not switch from normal honey to vegan honee, and only one person definitely would.\n\nOur tasters said they were willing to pay anything between R70 and R150 for their favourite jar of honey, \u201cdepending on the size and brand\u2019.\n\nThe vegan honee is selling for R57 and is packed with 1363 kilojoules of energy per 100g serving, with 80 grams of carbohydrates per 100g.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Vegan honee is made from concentrated apple juice as opposed to honey, which is bee spit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9338/77291ccfd32c4ab9b3d519c765070c74.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
