That'd be a dramatic drop in value of about 50% from its most recent private valuation.\n\nThe company could also delay its IPO to 2020, according to The Journal.\n\nThe Journal's report pegs the proposed IPO valuation at close to $20 billion, while Bloomberg says the firm is considering a valuation between $20 billion and $30 billion. PitchBook lists the company's most recent private valuation at $47 billion.\n\nA representative for The We Company declined to provide a comment for this story. The valuation could be subject to change since the company is still discussing the share sale terms, Bloomberg reported.\n\nSoftBank, one of The We Company's biggest investors, may purchase a significant amount of the $3 billion to $4 billion in shares the company is expected to sell in its IPO raise, serving as an anchor investor, according to The Journal. Another possibility is that SoftBank could infuse more capital into the startup that would allow it to delay its IPO until 2020, The Journal said, citing sources familiar with the conversations.\n\nThe We Company's CEO, Adam Neumann, reportedly flew to Tokyo to meet with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son to discuss these options.\n\nThe We Company publicly filed its IPO paperwork in August, confirming what has been one of the most hotly anticipated market debuts of the year.\n\nRemaining questions about WeWork and its CEO\n\nLeading up to the IPO, various aspects of The We Company's business have come under scrutiny, including its valuation, its business model, and even its CEO. While its S-1 filing from August answered some questions about the company and its business model, it left others wide open and prompted some concerns.\n\nAmong the biggest uncertainties involves how The We Company identities itself, as it seems to straddle the line between being a technology startup and a real-estate company. The We Company, for example, has purchased software startups to boost its data-analytics offerings, but its business model is largely driven by renting office space to tenants.\n\nThere's also the question of what could happen to WeWork in the event of an economic recession, which could cause tenants to save money by cutting back on office space \u2014 the crux of WeWork's business model. Neumann, however, told Business Insider earlier this year that WeWork would be well positioned in such a scenario. That's because, he said, his company offered office space at a lower rate than competitors, therefore appealing for companies looking to slash costs.\n\nNeumann himself has raised some red flags for investors, however, through moves such as purchasing buildings and leasing them back to WeWork and raising $700 million over the past five years by selling off his WeWork shares. WeWork has also lost nearly a dozen of its human resources managers over the last year, with several reporting disagreements or clashes with Neumann or company co-president Jen Berrent, according to The Information.\n\nAmong the most recent developments in the story leading up to WeWork's IPO has been the revelation that The We Company retrieved the $5.9 million it initially paid to Neumann to retain the trademark rights to the word \"we\" as part of its re-branding ahead of its IPO.\n\nThe New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway poked some criticism at the company's move to pay Neumann so much for the trademark in his initial analysis following the S-1 filing.\n\n\"Adam also owned the rights to the 'We' trademark, which the firm decided they must own and paid the founder/CEO $5.9 million for the rights,\" Galloway wrote. \"The rights to a name nearly identical to the name of the firm where he's the founder/CEO and largest shareholder. YOU. CAN'T. MAKE. THIS. S---. UP.\"\n\nThe company also recently added former Uber executive Frances Frei to its board of directors, which made Frei the first female board member after WeWork faced some backlash for its board which previously consisted only of men.\n\nThe move, however, might not be enough to satisfy critics, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.\n\n\"WeWork won't change investor perception of the company by giving a board seat to one woman who cynics see as adding little more than weak cover to poorly-governed companies,\" Gordon said via email to Business Insider.\n\nThe buzzy coworking startup hasn't said when it will list, but it's expected to start its IPO road show next week, according to Bloomberg.\n\nWith additional reporting by Graham Rapier", "description": "WeWork is said to be considering a valuation for its initial public offering that would be roughly half of its $47 billion private valuation.", "authors": ["Lisa Eadicicco"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d71132a2e22af723547ccd5-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
