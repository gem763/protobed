I think WWE proves that it doesn\u2019t matter your background, your ethnicity and your economy level or anything. You can achieve greatness.\u201d\n\nCorbin, who arrogantly refers to himself as King Corbin in the ring, said it was amazing to be part of the move to Fox, which will bring new audiences to watch his performance.\n\nEspecially in South Africa. I love going over there \u2013 just the energy and culture and everything else. Titus O\u2019Neil\n\nTitus O\u2019Neil said he grew up poor in a single parent household.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people in that situation globally, who look like me, talk like me, dance like me, walk like me. And I want all those kids and families to understand that there is hope out there for us and people who look like us. When I was growing up there were not a lot of people like minorities on TV who had positive influences. There were all stereotypical characters.\n\n\u201cAnd now there are likes of Kofi Kingston [who lost his title to Brock Lesnar at the main event last Friday], the New Day, the list goes on and so many other talented Afro-American performers like Mark Henry, Booker T.\n\n\u201cIt warms my heart to be part of that class of people that have not only broken barriers but also set barriers and different mindset of what Afro-American people can do in this business.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neil said the move to Fox would allow SA fans to watch him continue being one of the pillars of positive change in the world.\n\n\u201cEspecially in South Africa. I love going over there \u2013 just the energy and culture and everything else. I\u2019ve been over there few times.\u201d\n\nHe said he grew up watching Friday night SmackDown and Monday night Raw and never envisaged himself that one day he would be part of a historic move to Fox. \u201cAs a kid I played football and basketball, I wanted to be like Michael Jordan. But, to be able to be part of this historic moment today is truly amazing.\u201d\n\nAnd the Australian-born tag team female wrestlers, the IIconics, said they would like to inspire South African women to triumph over their challenges.\n\nThe tag team is made of Billie Kay and Peyton Royce, who fell in love with wrestling at an early age.\n\nKay said their goal was to entertain.\n\n\u201cSo when you are watching the IIconics, we just want to entertain and make people feel like the way we felt inspired when we watched wrestling when we were younger. So that will be our message first and foremost. The other message is that we would like to inspire men and women all around the world to chase their dreams because we are living proof that if you chase your dreams, work hard, you can really achieve anything.\u201d\n\nRoyce said: \u201cWrestling is our childhood dream come true so this is what we wanted to do since we were nine or 10 years old and we are living our dreams.\u201d\n\nAsked if they don\u2019t worry about getting injured, Kay said: \u201cWe don\u2019t cringe. We are badass women. We are WWE superstars. We would take the fight and hit no matter what.\u201d", "description": "Dreams do come true if you persevere no matter what your situation is.
