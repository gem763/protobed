What do they say on MSNBC, who have gone very far left because look who's giving them their paycheck,\" Maher continued. \"What do they say if it's Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren at the top of the ticket? They 'never Trump' but would Nicolle Wallace vote for them?\"\n\n\"There are a lot of folks like Nicolle and Joe [Scarborough] and others who have said, 'Look, I'll vote for the dog in the car' if that's who the Democrats nominate,\" Steele said.\n\n\"I'm just amused because I see them on MSNBC and I remember how they used to talk when it was Bush and Romney and they didn't even want ObamaCare!\" Maher exclaimed.", "description": "\"Real Time\" host Bill Maher mocked MSNBC's \"Never Trump\" hosts and analysts for going \"very\u00a0far left\" during the Trump era.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
