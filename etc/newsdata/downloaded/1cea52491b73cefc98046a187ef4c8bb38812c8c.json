However, some studies found no link or even the opposite.\n\nThe research, based on tracking more than one million participants for up to 20 years, is not the first to suggest dairy is linked to prostate cancer.\n\nHowever, the results on cheese, milk and butter have thrown up mixed results and the risk is thought to be small.\n\nExperts at the Mayo Clinic analysed the results of 47 studies that delved into the link between diet and the disease\n\nIt is thought eating large quantities of dairy increases the amount of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) inside the body.\n\nThe protein interacts with cells and causes a \u2018cascade of reactions\u2019, according to the World Cancer Research Fund International.\n\nProstate Cancer UK says the link between the disease and dairy products \u2018might be because of the calcium in them\u2019.\n\nBut the charity warns it is important to get 700mg of calcium \u2013 three glasses of milk \u2013 each day to \u2018keep your bones healthy\u2019.\n\nThe review, which analysed studies published since 2006, was published in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association.\n\nDr John Shin, lead author, has now called for more trials to investigate the link between dairy products and prostate cancer.\n\nDiscussing the findings, he said: \u2018Our review highlighted a cause for concern with high consumption of dairy products.\u2019\n\nThe results did not say what amount of dairy was linked to an increased risk.\n\nResults also showed men who stuck to plant-based diets were less likely to develop prostate cancer.\n\nThe American Institute for Cancer Research recommends a plant-based diet to slash the risk of cancer because of the 'protective nutrients'.\n\nThe study found no link to an increased risk of prostate cancer from other animal-based foods, such as red and white meat or fish.\n\nDr Shin and colleagues pointed out the rate of prostate cancer is higher in Western countries, where people tend to consume more dairy.\n\nMore than 47,000 men each year are diagnosed with prostate cancer in Britain. The disease claims the lives of 11,000 people each year.\n\nFigures show around 175,000 men are diagnosed with the killer disease each year in the US. Some 30,000 people die from it each year.", "description": "Experts at the Mayo Clinic in the US analysed 47 studies that delved into the link between diet and the disease.
