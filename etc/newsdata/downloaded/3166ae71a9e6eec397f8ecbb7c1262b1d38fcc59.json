Secured cards reduce that risk by making your credit limit equal to your initial security deposit, which serves as collateral if you don\u2019t make your payments.\n\nIllustration by Tim Boelaars More\n\nOf course, credit cards for borrowers with poor credit tend to be no-frills. You won\u2019t generally find rewards or perks in this category, although late fees may be lower. Also don\u2019t expect guaranteed approval. If an issuer claims otherwise, read the fine print to make sure you won\u2019t be throwing your money away on expensive fees.\n\nAnd speaking of fees: More so than other types of credit cards, the secured-card category requires a degree of caution upon entry. Some issuers seem to be mostly interested in making a quick buck off a population that might be financially struggling or have poor financial literacy. As a result, we only evaluated secured cards that don\u2019t charge steep annual fees or bury hidden \u201cgotcha\u201d fees in their fine print. The best credit cards to build credit also give cardholders clear instructions about what they need to do and how long it will take to get a higher credit limit.\n\nBut even with these caveats, the best credit cards in 2019 do have some good options for people who need to establish or repair their credit history.\n\nIllustration by Tania Guerra More\n\nThe Winner: Affinity Secured Visa Credit Card\n\nKey Terms\n\n\u2022Rewards: N/A\n\n\u2022Annual Fee: $0, $250 initial deposit\n\n\u2022APR: 12.35%\n\nWhy You Should Get It\n\nAs far as bad-credit credit cards go, this secured Visa card has a few features we like. A $250 minimum initial deposit is about at the midpoint, according to our database, among credit cards for people with bad credit, and it\u2019s an amount we think will be accessible for a large number of people. While we don\u2019t encourage cardholders to revolve a balance, this card\u2019s APR is reasonable \u2014 and actually, it\u2019s lower than the APRs on some of our other Best Credit Cards of 2019 category winners. And if you\u2019re looking for a card to build your credit, you should make sure that the issuer reports positive activity like on-time payments to the three major credit bureaus, which this card does.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The best secured credit card.", "authors": ["Martha C.
