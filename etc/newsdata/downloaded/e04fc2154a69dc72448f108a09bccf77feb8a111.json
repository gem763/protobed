The star noted that his improbable romance with Stefani is, in a way, more shocking to him than being named People\u2019s \u201cSexiest Man Alive\u201d in 2017.\n\n\u201cIf you thought the People magazine cover was shocking, mine and Gwen\u2019s relationship is probably the biggest head-scratcher,\u201d he joked (via People).\n\nBLAKE SHELTON OFFICIATES TRACE ADKINS, VICTORIA PRATT WEDDING IN NEW ORLEANS\n\nShelton and Stefani got together in Season 9 of \u201cThe Voice\u201d in 2015, which was her second time as a coach. Shelton admitted to McBride that, during Stefani\u2019s run in Season 7, he didn\u2019t get a chance to really know her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll even say that she was, of all the coaches, the least that I had gotten to know the first season she was on the show because she had just had a baby, and I mean just had a baby,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so any time there was downtime, she was busy. She was gone, she was on her trailers, she was taking care of the baby, you know, and there was never those moments that usually happen on this show, where at the end of the day we\u2019re sitting around out here at the couches and having a drink, talking, laughing.\u201d\n\nDespite getting a slow start on their relationship, Shelton says that they\u2019ve both rubbed off on each other after four years of dating. Specifically, he notes that he got the notorious rocker into country music.\n\nGWEN STEFANI SAYS BLAKE SHELTON RELATIONSHIP GOT HER OVER HER DIVORCE FROM GAVIN ROSSDALE\n\n\u201cIf she was sitting here, she would tell you she\u2019s never going to be good with names. She can\u2019t remember anybody\u2019s name,\u201d he explained. \u201cShe knows so many songs now. And in fact, I would say that Gwen, I don\u2019t know how she\u2019d feel about me saying this, but I\u2019m going to say it. I bet she listens to probably 75 percent country music now.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that she now uses country playlists to put her kids to bed at night. She shares children Kingston, 13, Zuma, 11, and Apollo, 5, with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale.\n\nMeanwhile, Shelton has been on a musical journey of his own as he gets to know his girlfriend\u2019s hits.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go watch her show in Vegas because you got to remember I\u2019m playing catch-up on Gwen Stefani,\u201d he explained. \u201cI knew who No Doubt was, and Gwen Stefani, but only the big hits, and then you go see her show in Las Vegas and you start going, \u2018Oh my God, that one too, that song. Oh that\u2019s you.\u2019 You know? And it\u2019s just a crazy\u2026 It gives me goosebumps talking about it because of the impact she had, especially as a female rock, ska, whatever you classify it, as just to have the impact that she has is pretty crazy.\u201d", "description": "Blake Shelton opened up about his four-year relationship with fellow musician and \u201cThe Voice\u201d coach, Gwen Stefani.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/12/13/694940094001_5679095109001_5679081786001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
