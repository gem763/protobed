Ventura County officials have ordered mandatory evacuations in the area surrounding the blaze.\n\nThe fire has encircled and threatened the presidential Ronald Reagan Library, home to records from his time in office, his Air Force One aircraft, and the burial place of the late president and his wife.\n\nHelicopters were seen dumping water and fire retardant on the library to prevent it from being consumed by the fast-approaching flames.\n\nJust before dawn on Wednesday a Easy Fire erupted in Simi Valley, just 20 miles from downtown Los Angeles. The fire started around 6am and in a matter of just three hours razed over 1,000 acres of land\n\nPictures from the Tierra Rejada Road ranch show it on fire with three horses in front running for cover\n\nThe rescue: This is the black horse that ran back to the ranch to rescue this young colt\n\nIn the end all the horses at the particular farm were brought to safety except for one who had to be euthanized for breaking her front legs trying to flee\n\nThe Easy Fire along with the Getty Fire and other blazes raging in Southern California have led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents including celebrities.\n\nThe fires have also forced a hasty roundup of scores of horses in the area.\n\nWorkers from Los Angeles' Animal Services Department tending to the animals at the Hansen Dam stables said they would welcome any horse that needs shelter for as long as necessary.\n\n'We are going to keep this place open if we need, if anybody needs this space. The stalls are here for these horses that are being evacuated,' said Lucy Ruiz, an animal technician at the Animal Services Department.\n\nA 16-year-old horse named Prince Toby, who longs to the Hammarberg family of the upscale Pacific Palisades neighorhood, is one of those horses that needed rescuing.\n\nWhen the fire broke out in the early hours of Monday, the Hammarbergs evacuated to a hotel. Animal rescue authorities under a police escort went to get Toby at his home in a nearby canyon.\n\nHarrowing photo from the wildfire's affect on nearby ranches emerged Wednesday.

They are used to being together and here he is in a strange place with strange horses,' Louise Hammarberg, a Swedish national who has been living in Los Angeles since she was 17, said after visiting her horse Toby.\n\nPrince Toby was at a stable in the canyon when the Getty fire ignited on Monday morning near the Getty Center museum, forcing evacuations in Brentwood, Pacific Palisades and other neighborhoods.\n\n'We weren't allowed up in the canyon, but he was taken out of there by a hauler and a police escort, because people weren't allowed, so I guess that is why they needed the police to take them out,' Hammarberg said.\n\nAuthorities have had a lot of practice evacuating horses, as wildfires become more frequent and intense, which the state says is largely a function of climate change.\n\nMore than 200 horses were hauled to safety in the Saddleridge Fire near the San Fernando Valley earlier this month.\n\nA rancher pictured above removing their horse from a burning ranch in Simi Valley, California\n\nA rancher pictured tries to put out a fire in a henhouse in a burning ranch as the Easy Fire spreads near Simi Valley, North of Los Angeles on Wednesday\n\nTowering billows of smoke took over the hills of the rural valley in the wake of a state-wide wildfire crisis\n\nOne of the area's worst fires, the December 2017 Thomas fire, which swept through Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, killed at least 54 horses, authorities said.\n\nSouthern California is one of the largest horse-racing centers in the United States, with its sunny climate allowing horses to run year-round. Moreover, the canyons and foothills are an inviting terrain for recreational riders.\n\nThe Hammarberg and thousands of other families evacuated from the Getty Fire still do not know when they will be going home.\n\n'We don't know and that is the hard part. Because if you know you are going to be gone for a week or for a day, you plan accordingly. ... He (Prince Toby) is ready to go back too, I think,' she said.", "description": "Dramatic video from the raging Easy Fire in California shows the moment a horse run towards its fellow stallions at a burning stable to help them escape the blaze.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/20/20393486-0-image-a-117_1572465652415.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
