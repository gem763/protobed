James Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican, announced on the Senate floor that he and GOP colleagues drafted the bill \u201cbecause we want to be sure we have it ready in case we can\u2019t reach agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we wait, it will be too late to get it done by year-end,\u201d he added.\n\nThe annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is a wide-ranging blueprint for military spending and policy prescriptions for the coming year, but the Republican-run Senate and Democratic-led House have been unable to reach a compromise measure.\n\nMr. Inhofe\u2019s announcement comes as Democratic lawmakers vowed to block the bill\u2019s passage if it includes funding for President Trump\u2019s controversial border wall \u2014 the key sticking point that has largely stalled negotiations thus far.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell argued Tuesday that any attempt by Democrats to filibuster a separate defense appropriations bill this week will expose what he called the hypocrisy behind their ongoing efforts to impeach Mr. Trump.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican said his chamber will take up the military funding bill, including $250 million in military assistance for Ukraine, this week.\n\nHe said the vote for the Department of Defense money will be a \u201clitmus test\u201d for Democrats to see if they can work on other issues while on their drive to impeach Mr. Trump, allegedly for withholding Ukrainian military aid in a search for damaging information of potential 2020 Democratic rival Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, called it \u201claughable\u201d to suggest Democrats are holding up money to Ukraine. The New York Democrat said the blame falls on the Republican leadership, which he said was seeking to take funds from health programs and military families to pay for the president\u2019s border wall.\n\n\u201cDemocrats, of course, are not going to proceed to a defense bill that steals from our troops to pay for a border wall the American people don\u2019t want,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.\n\nMr. Inhofe\u2019s pared-down stopgap NDAA will only include \u201cnoncontroversial essentials to fulfill the Congress\u2019s duty to provide for the common defense.\u201d\n\nBut included in the proposal are funds to conduct \u201coversight of military construction and acquisition programs\u201d which is widely believed to fund the border wall, although that was not specifically cited.\n\nThe so-called \u2018skinny bill,\u2019 which has come together after 11 weeks of negotiations between the House and Senate, authorizes pay hikes for troops and civilians employed by the Defense Department, as well as providing child care services for military families.\n\nIt would continue \u201ckey operational authorities\u201d that U.S. forces are using to combat terrorist organizations and allocate funds for \u201csustaining readiness,\u201d according to a committee aide, and \u201cis intended to be brought up only in the event both sides can\u2019t reconcile their differences in a timely fashion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not just inside-the-Beltway gridlock. The world is watching,\u201d Mr. Inhofe said in his plea to rally support for the bill. \u201cOur allies and our enemies are watching. They want to know if America is serious about its role in the world and its national defense.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Staff writer Alex Swoyer contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
