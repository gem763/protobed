The total for the industry came to just $178 million plus interest.\n\nChronican does not mince words discussing the impact on NAB in having to find another billion dollars for remediation. \u201cYou have to recognise that ultimately our shareholders are paying for it,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are very large numbers and it's real money. It comes off the value of the investment that our shareholders have in us.\u201d\n\nWhat we wanted to do was make sure we injected our sense of urgency into the business. \u2014 Phil Chronican\n\nHe has steered the overall shift in the bank\u2019s decision to finally come to grips with the crisis this year. With ASIC repeatedly rejecting earlier NAB methodology for assessing the scope of its customer remediation program, Chronican put his foot on the pedal.\n\n\u201cThe board was very focused on making sure that where we have had issues, we tackle them decisively and work with urgency,\u201d he tells AFR Weekend. \u201cWhat we wanted to do was make sure we injected our sense of urgency into the business.\u201d\n\nNone of the big banks has exactly led the way on this, and ASIC has chosen to remain publicly silent in the face of NAB\u2019s startling market concession a week ago on the scope of the damage.\n\nFor the regulator to offer praise would be to invite censure should NAB have to later dig deep again. But ASIC must surely be satisfied to see big-dollar compensation provisions finally emerging, after squeezing the banks hard.\n\nThe NAB board concluded last year, in a self-assessment document prepared for APRA, that it had failed on a number of fronts to bring sufficient urgency and intensity to resolving issues.\n\nIn practice this has now played out with the huge commitment, finally, to meeting ASIC\u2019s demands that NAB (and all the banks) satisfy the regulator with their methodology for calculating customer refunds.\n\nNAB has a team of close to 500 people now working on remediation across both the wealth and non-wealth businesses. Chronican and the board have all immersed themselves at various times to understand the process \u2013 and make it clear internally that obfuscation on this matter is over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met with the team in the wealth business in North Sydney,\u201d Chronican says, \u201cand that\u2019s to understand the calibre of the people and the urgency with which they\u2019re working. And I\u2019ve met with the team in Melbourne doing much of the non-wealth-related customer remediation work.\n\n\u201cEssentially, when you\u2019re in a large organisation it\u2019s sometimes difficult to know whether or not things are being done the way you think they should be, or the way you think they are, [so its] going down and spending time listening to people around how they do it, what they\u2019re focused on, how they think. Communicating with customers is important, and it\u2019s [important to] understand the nature of those communications.\u201d\n\nAfter publicly releasing its APRA self-assessment report, the NAB board followed through its commitment to set up a board customer committee. The committee \u2013 with the whole NAB board \u2013 has traipsed through the mess, meeting the Resolve team grappling with the remediation issues. \u201cWe wanted the board to see first-hand how the teams operated and the calibre of the people,\u201d Chronican remarks.\n\nASIC's James Shipton called out NAB's earlier tendency to delay breach reports. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nThis is a significant cultural change for a bank that developed a reputation in recent years for plenty of \u201ccustomers first\u201d talk in public while aggressively contesting every step behind the scenes with the regulator \u2013 from breach reports to remediation. On the latter, the NAB had to be dragged kicking and screaming.\n\nIn a letter sent on May 9 last year to NAB general counsel Sharon Cook, ASIC\u2019s financial services enforcement boss Tim Mullaly said the bank\u2019s proposals (at that time) for remediation over fees for no service failed \u201cto adequately reflect any insight into the seriousness of the suspected misconduct which \u2026 affects a substantial number of customers\u201d.\n\nAnd when the new chairman of ASIC, James Shipton met then chief executive Andrew Thorburn and his team on April 26 last year, Shipton raised the matter of 110 occasions between 2014 and 2017 when the bank had sent breach reports outside the time limit \u2013 seemingly giving ASIC the bird.\n\nBut Thorburn did act to establish NAB\u2019s centre for customer remediation in July last year, with Cook in charge, in an attempt to centralise all the remediation matters.\n\nLast February, Thorburn resigned. He had been tarnished by crises that ranged from police action over allegations of a massive fraud run out his office by his former chief of staff and an outside contractor, through to revelations of the bank\u2019s less-than-straightforward dealings with ASIC. The royal commission report was devastating. Chairman Ken Henry announced his own departure on the same day as Thorburn.\n\nIt was a moment that presaged the need for a real cultural shift at the top of the bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, all the big banks and AMP have suffered catastrophic reputational damage over fees for no service since ASIC blew the whistle. The regulator announced at the time that it would send its reports to the boards of all banks \u2013 to ensure there was no hiding. It signalled clearly in that 2016 report that there was a serious problem in the culture across the industry; that this must be remedied; and that it could only come from the top.\n\nPublic shaming\n\nThe crisis was exacerbated when ASIC last year handed its files to the financial services royal commission, which, armed with this evidence, called executives to the stand for a very public hammering and shaming, dragging the secrets of bank-world onto daily TV.\n\nChronican was appointed acting CEO of the NAB on February 7 this year and then announced as Henry\u2019s replacement as chairman on March 6. The search for a new NAB chief executive yielded Ross McEwan, most recently CEO of the Royal Bank of Scotland, who is expected to start in the role on December 2.\n\nIf NAB under Henry and Thorburn projected something of a new-wave groove in public, with Thorburn\u2019s \"listening tours\" and too many quirky news reports about Henry\u2019s affinity for protecting wildlife and a focus on hairy-nosed wombats, the new guys are certain to be cut from more traditional cloth.\n\nChronican is a more steely character with less time for talk and a focus on action \u2013 an initial impression borne out by the stunning billion-dollar provision to get on top of customer remediation as his first step to rebuilding the bank\u2019s reputation. He concedes it has taken a huge amount of focus internally; and that it has not been easy.\n\nPhil Chronican is willing to pay a huge price for rebuilding NAB's reputation. Alex Ellinghausen\n\n\u201cObviously this issue [fees for no service] predates the royal commission by quite some time. And it\u2019s obvious with hindsight that people didn\u2019t fully appreciate where it was going to end,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile I think each of the banks could see line-of-sight through to their own financial planning businesses \u2013 that they ran \u2013 it was a more difficult issue with the licensees or planning groups operating off the financial services licence of the parent.\u201d\n\nThese sectors of the business \u2013 containing huge numbers of self-employed or \"aligned\" advisers was opaque \u2013 and infested with poor record-keeping, and sometimes no record keeping.\n\nASIC made it clear it intended to hold the licence holder (the bank) responsible for these subgroups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChronican acknowledges this was not an unreasonable position. \u201cBut the difficulty is we didn\u2019t have the same line of sight into the record keeping [in the subgroups].\n\n\u201cEarly this year, one of the first things I did in coming into this role was to accelerate the work overall of recognising where we had remediation work to be done, and accelerating bringing it to a close. It was important, I felt, for NAB that the issues that had got us to the position we were in in February\" \u2013 after the royal commission report, and with ASIC\u2019s latest report card on fees for no service about to steam open in March \u2013 \"get put behind us as quickly as possible.\"\n\nIt had been relatively straightforward for NAB\u2019s large remediation teams (under the aegis of Cook and Jocelyn Turner, executive general manager of customer resolution and remediation) to quantify the amounts for NAB\u2019s financial planning business, where records were mostly intact. That methodology had been agreed.\n\nBut there was a far more difficult set of issues in the aligned group of financial advisers and it has taken until very recently for the methodology to assess this round of remediation to be agreed with the regulator. NAB has been forced to arrive at a realistic, reliable (and shocking) estimate of the amount likely to be refunded.\n\nHuge number\n\nChronican wanted the huge number out quickly to allow the market to digest it. \u201cAs soon as we had that, I was very keen that we get the information into the public domain,\u201d he says, adding that this obviously enables a proper consideration of the full year results in November.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, at least part of our thinking on this was making sure we got as many of these issues dealt with this year so that we can next year have the business report on the underlying business performance and not be distracted by these large one-offs.\n\nNAB\u2019s exceptionally large remediation costs also carry the tail of the bank\u2019s longer exposure. NAB made a decision when reforms to financial advice (known as FoFA) were introduced, that it would adopt the \"fees for service\" model early, in place of commissions. And then, of course, it all went wrong with inadequate controls by banks \u2013 transmogrifying (industry-wide) into \"fees for no service\" \u2013 as ASIC described the abuse of customer trust in its 2016 report.\n\nFor ASIC, it has been a hard slog. No bank has happily volunteered the numbers on its wrongdoing. In the deep-down caves of the regulator, its own teams of analysts have grappled with everything bankers and their lawyers could dream up over the years to frustrate ASIC\u2019s demands for full resolution and remediation of the customer rip-offs. Demanding an acceptable methodology from each bank, and AMP, has been ASIC\u2019s key to redress.\n\nWith NAB now conceding $2 billion in provisions and ANZ last week adding a further $485 million, bringing its expected remediation to $1.1 billion (after admitting in 2016 to just $49 million), and with Commonwealth Bank putting aside $2.1 billion and Westpac (so far) reaching $1.44 billion, the final number could balloon beyond $8 billion or $9 billion as ASIC continues to twist arms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who initially dismissed ASIC\u2019s major report in 2016 as \u201cnot really affecting many customers\u201d have gone silent as the staggering numbers pile up.\n\nFor NAB, it has had to deal with four subgroups under the NAB Advice labels. But this year has brought a sea-change in the bank\u2019s dealings with ASIC, reflecting the change in the mood of the boardroom \u2013 with progress reports coming in every month or so.\n\nASIC\u2019s latest extremely granular report card, issued in March this year, showed NAB still missing an acceptable methodology to review the experience of customers in its four licensees.\n\nThat has now been reversed, with ASIC accepting the new method submitted by the bank. This underpinned NAB\u2019s new provisions for refunds based on fees received between 2009 and 2018 of approximately $1.3 billion \u2013 and a refund rate of 36 per cent. The bank noted in its release to the ASX that its assumptions included circumstances \u201cwhere documents were not available or readily accessible, including where advisers are no longer working in the industry\u201d.\n\nThe bank also disclosed a previously unrevealed remediation that came out of another ASIC review - of consumer credit insurance. NAB said (possibly forlornly) that provisions for this remediation had been increased to reflect higher refunds needing to be paid, based on experience thus far.\n\nIn fact, there were higher estimates on just about everything. As a case study, the NAB disclosures reflect an industry that enjoyed money flowing in like an open fire hose and with few decent controls. When refunds to customers are estimated in the region of 26 per cent and 36 per cent, it shows a level of non-customer care that now seems breathtaking in its self-assurance.\n\nASIC may not be blowing the trumpet but the mere fact it has ticked off on methodology \u2013 at NAB, for example \u2013 is the clearest signal the regulator is finally getting what it wants.\n\nIt is also a sign that NAB has finally got real about its problems.\n\nFor Phil Chronican, adding a billion dollars to the loss column of a big bank was probably not a part of his dreams. But if rebuilding NAB\u2019s reputation comes with a big cost, Chronican has made it clear he is willing to pay that price.", "description": "NAB's reputation lay in tatters when Phil Chronican took over as acting CEO.
