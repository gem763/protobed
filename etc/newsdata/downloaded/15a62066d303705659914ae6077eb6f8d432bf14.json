Nonetheless, since no property is ever dead in this age of sequels, reboots and spin-offs, Vince Gilligan has seen fit to revisit his small-screen phenomenon with El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, a two-hour coda that picks up directly after his series\u2019 2013 finale, charting the efforts of Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to escape arrest and death in the aftermath of Walter White\u2019s (Bryan Cranston) blaze-of-glory massacre.\n\nWhat he delivers is fan service of a moderately effective sort. Although in the process, he also proves that sometimes, closure is overrated.\n\nGiven that El Camino has been shrouded in secrecy up until the moment of its Netflix premiere (this morning, Oct. 11), it goes without saying that everything that follows is a spoiler. What\u2019s disheartening about Gilligan\u2019s feature, however, is that those spoilers are rather mundane, as there\u2019s very little about this material that won\u2019t be largely expected from die-hards. Moreover, despite superbly composed widescreen visuals and a tense late shootout, both of which strive to cast the proceedings as a neo-Western about a desperado on the run and in search of freedom, peace and salvation, this saga plays as little more than an extended (and, at times, distended) episode of the show itself. No matter its grand trappings\u2014including a late explosion that shows off Gilligan\u2019s bigger-than-usual budget\u2014it\u2019s an afterthought that\u2019s surprisingly small in scale.\n\nEl Camino opens with a flashback to Jesse and Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) on the banks of a river shortly before the latter\u2019s demise, discussing possible future plans should they make it out of their circumstances alive. Mike suggests Alaska as a \u201clast frontier\u201d destination where one can start fresh, and that advice hovers over the ensuing action, which in the present day finds a bearded, scarred, and heavily freaked-out Jesse fleeing the scene of White\u2019s slaughter of neo-Nazis\u2014who had kept him imprisoned like a dog for months, cooking their meth\u2014in former captor Todd\u2019s (Jesse Plemons) El Camino. In need of help, he turns, naturally, to old buddies Badger (Matt L. Jones) and Skinny Pete (Charles Baker). They\u2019re still clownish second-tier gangsters with a gift for talking trash\u2014playing a racing video game, Badger tells Pete \u201cYou drive like a blind guy with no legs\u201d\u2014and when Jesse arrives on their doorstep, they instinctively take him in.\n\nIt\u2019s nice to see this trio reunited, and El Camino largely exists to provide such nostalgic pleasures. When Skinny Pete tells the scruffy, filthy Jesse that he can use any of his colognes, and Badger chimes in with, \u201cObsession\u2019s the bomb, yo\u2014I got it for him for Christmas,\u201d it\u2019s hard not to be happy about this opportunity to spend more time in the company of these characters. Yet considering the relative lack of momentum to the plot itself, which inches forward in short bursts, there\u2019s an immediate sense that that\u2019s just about all Gilligan has to offer. And it\u2019s an impression only compounded by the writer/director\u2019s decision to interrupt the plot proper with flashbacks that explain, and contextualize, Jesse\u2019s current behavior, and plan to escape\u2014and which are, predictably, populated by cameos from some of the series\u2019 notable players.\n\n\u201c No matter its grand trappings, [\u2018El Camino\u2019] is an afterthought that\u2019s surprisingly small in scale. \u201d\n\nThe longest of those yesteryear sequences involves Jesse\u2019s imprisonment at the hands of Todd, a laid-back sociopath whose pleasant demeanor is merely a fa\u00e7ade masking his sadistic psychosis. Plemons remains chilling as the white-nationalist lunatic, as when, while driving, he cheerily sings Dr. Hook\u2019s \u201cSharing the Night Together\u201d\u2014waving his hands out the car\u2019s open window, and even motioning to a passing truck to honk their horn\u2014while Jesse lies in the trunk alongside a rolled-up-in-carpet dead body. Gilligan uses this sequence as a way of both revisiting bygone friends and affording Jesse a memory that will give him the means to acquire some get-out-of-dodge cash. And he directs it with slow-burn menace and electric visual style; an upturned shot of a foreground Todd (on the street) and a background Jesse (on a second-floor apartment balcony), their heads positioned so they\u2019re directly facing each other, is one of many flourishes that energize this methodical tale.\n\nJesse\u2019s ensuing odyssey brings him into contact with a variety of faces both old and new, and Paul\u2014looking insanely haggard and stressed out for most of the two-hour runtime\u2014is as good as ever. His Jesse was always most captivating when he was more anxious, desperate and furious than goofy (yes, we do get one throwback, \u201cYeah, bitch!\u201d), and El Camino embraces that fact, turning his predicament into a narrow, claustrophobic flight from peril. Which isn\u2019t to say that the film isn\u2019t funny. Instead, it\u2019s that most of its comedy comes from sources other than Jesse, save for a late bit about a high school diploma that comes during a years-earlier scene shared by Jesse and Walter at a diner following their \u201cFour Days Out\u201d desert cook\u2014a reunion that gives viewers what they want, if not a lot more than that.\n\nThen again, that\u2019s the story of El Camino in a nutshell. Unlike HBO\u2019s recent Deadwood: The Movie, which bestowed David Milch\u2019s acclaimed Western series with the ambiguous close it was denied by the network in 2006 (when it was abruptly cancelled), Gilligan\u2019s film tells us what happened next to Jesse without ever really justifying why we needed to know it in the first place. The show\u2019s \u201cfinal\u201d sight of Jesse speeding out into the night, terrified and traumatized and free, was always an adequate and fitting end for the character, in need of no further elaboration. As a result, discovering that he had to perform some twisty-turny criminal stuff in order to facilitate his heartwarming exodus feels underwhelming, and devoid of the character-expanding richness that defines the writer/director\u2019s Breaking Bad spin-off, Better Call Saul.\n\nThat El Camino is superfluous won\u2019t matter to fanatics who, if only for completionism\u2019s sake, will want to know Jesse\u2019s ultimate outcome\u2014and who will undoubtedly revel in the crispness of Gilligan\u2019s storytelling, which is marked by many small clockwork mechanisms operating in perfect harmony. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Breaking Bad was whole before this film existed, and doesn\u2019t feel more so now that it\u2019s here.", "description": "\u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 creator Vince Gilligan directs Aaron Paul in a neo-Western-influenced saga about Jesse Pinkman\u2019s bid for freedom.
