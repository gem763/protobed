USADA said Brown tampered with records, was complicit in trafficking testosterone and administered high doses of a supplement called L-carnitine, which is believed to enhance athletic performance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNo athletes were cited for wrongdoing in the news release, though several participated in the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe athletes in these cases found the courage to speak out and ultimately exposed the truth,\u201d said Travis Tygart, USADA\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWhile acting in connection with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr. Salazar and Dr. Brown demonstrated that winning was more important than the health and well-being of the athletes they were sworn to protect.\u201d\n\nSalazar intends to appeal the arbitration panel\u2019s decision, and he said in a statement Monday night he was \u201cshocked by the outcome today.\u201d\n\n\u201cThroughout this six-year investigation my athletes and I have endured unjust, unethical and highly damaging treatment from USADA,\u201d Salazar said. \"This is demonstrated by the misleading statement released by Travis Tygart stating that we put winning ahead of athlete safety. This is completely false and contrary to the findings of the arbitrators.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSalazar noted that in rendering its decision, the panel said it felt the coach \"does not appear to have been motivated by any bad intention to commit the violations the Panel found. In fact, the Panel was struck by the amount of care generally taken by Respondent to ensure that whatever new technique or method or substance he was going to try was lawful under the World Anti-Doping Code, with USADA\u2019s witness characterizing him as the coach they heard from the most with respect to trying to ensure that he was complying with his obligations.\u201d\n\nUSADA\u2019s announcement marked the culmination of a four-year investigation that the organization said included interviews with 30 witnesses, more than 2,000 exhibits and nearly 5,800 pages of transcripts. The organization said it relied on eyewitness accounts, contemporaneous emails and medical records. The punishment became official after a two-year court battle as two independent arbitration panels considered the cases.\n\n\u201cFollowing two evidentiary hearings, Salazar\u2019s lasting seven days and Brown\u2019s lasting six days, and a lengthy post-hearing review of all the evidence and testimony, the [arbitration] panel found that Salazar and Brown possessed and trafficked a banned performance-enhancing substance and administered or attempted to administer a prohibited method to multiple track and field athletes,\u201d USADA said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe news landed in the early days of the IAAF world championships, which are taking place in Doha, Qatar, where several of Salazar\u2019s past and present athletes are competing.\n\nA Nike spokesman said the company supports the coach\u2019s decision to appeal \"and wish him the full measure of due process that the rules require. \"\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision had nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete,\u201d the spokesman said in an emailed statement. \u201cAs the panel noted, they were struck by the amount of care Alberto took to ensure he was complying with the World Anti-Doping Code.\u201d\n\nSalazar is one of track\u2019s most celebrated coaches, but he has also faced scrutiny and skirted controversy for several years. The BBC first cast a light on some of his controversial practices in 2015, highlighting his reliance on infusions of L-carnitine, a supplement that turns fat into energy. According to Salazar\u2019s arbitration panel decision, the coach was first told about a \u201cnew sports drink coming out of the United Kingdom\u201d in 2011 by a Nike employee named Paul Winsper, who worked in the company\u2019s \u201cStark\u201d department, which the summary says \u201chad to do with new training revolutionary methods.\u201d Salazar reportedly said Winsper told him that he \u201cmight want to think about [the new sports drink] for your athletes that could really be, you know, a benefit.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy that point, Salazar and Brown had already apparently been experimenting with gels, creams and testosterone levels, according to summaries of the arbitration decisions. One athlete, Amy Begley, told investigators of an instance in which Salazar described a \u201ctestosterone cream that he was going to use for an experiment to see how much it would take to create a positive test,\u201d Brown\u2019s arbitration summary stated.\n\nThe summary further indicated that Salazar had alerted Nike executives to some of his testosterone testing \u2014 specifically an experiment that involved Salazar\u2019s sons using a cream and running on a treadmill for 20 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe know that rubbing arms and legs is more of a potential problem than hand shaking after an event since an athlete is much more likely to feel a \u201cblob\u201d in a hand shake,\u201d Brown wrote to Mike Parker, the chief executive of Nike, in 2009, according to the documents.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe arbitration panels noted that while allegations that \u201cBrown was complicit with Salazar in giving athletes dangerous levels of prescription vitamin D and thyroid medicine\u201d raised \u201cserious questions,\u201d they didn\u2019t violate the USADA codes in question at the hearing, so no ruling was made.\n\nSalazar is an accomplished long distance runner himself who won the New York City Marathon three times and the Boston Marathon once. He helped found the Nike Oregon Project in 2001 to help make Americans more competitive on a global stage. Backed by Nike, Salazar found success with several elite distance runners. Competing for Great Britain, Farah won gold medals at two distances \u2014 5,000 and 10,000 meters \u2014 in both the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics. He split with Salazar in October 2017.\n\nAt the 2016 Rio Games, Centrowitz, who grew up in Arnold, Md., and graduated from Broadneck High, became the first American since 1908 to win an Olympic title in the 1,500-meter race. Centrowitz split with Salazar after last season and began running with the Bowerman Track Club.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the year\u2019s biggest meet continues Tuesday in Doha, Salazar\u2019s status will no doubt create a buzz around the track that might linger into next year\u2019s Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Stephanie Bruce, an American long-distance runner, tweeted Monday night her \u201cfaith in the sport has been restored. Thanks to all those courageous individuals who spoke out and have been building this case. Mr. Salazar I hope we cease to see your influence in our running world. Also about DAMN time.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nUSA judo\u2019s Jack Hatton, an Olympic hopeful and \u2018true role model,\u2019 dies at 24\n\nRussia\u2019s spot in the Tokyo Olympics is threatened amid new doping concerns\n\nThey were once sent home for their Olympic protest.
