I could not be more excited about it and proud of you,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nMarkle, appearing an equally devoted friend, made the last-minute decision to fly to the Big Apple after seeing Williams beat Elina Svitolina in her semi-final, according to the Times.\n\nOn Satuday, she commands one of the most sought-after spots in sport.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nDemand for tickets to see whether Williams could capture an elusive record-equalling 24th major title was at a similar level to a year ago when she fell in the final to Naomi Osaka.\n\nYet demand for tickets to this year\u2019s showpiece match was 33% higher than in 2017 when Williams did not play in the final, according to StubHub.\n\nThe retailer showed tickets costing hundreds of dollars just to get into the Flushing Meadows facility on Saturday.", "description": "Amid the excitement of Serena Williams' latest bid for U.S. Open glory, some off-court news buzzed about the plaza at Flushing Meadows: a duchess had come to Queens.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427455704&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF87020", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
