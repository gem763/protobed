New streaming TV services will make you wait", "language": "en", "text": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - In 2013, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) shook up television by delivering 13 episodes of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d in one batch, a move that helped popularize streaming video and fueled a culture of binge watching.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Gamers and visitors take a rest at the booth of Netflix during Europe's leading digital games fair Gamescom, which showcases the latest trends of the computer gaming scene in Cologne, Germany, August 21, 2019. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo\n\nBut Apple Inc APPL.O, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and AT&T Inc (T.N) are largely rejecting that path as they prepare their own efforts to hook the online audiences that embraced Netflix.\n\nExecutives at AT&T\u2019s forthcoming HBO Max, a streaming service that will be unveiled to investors on Tuesday, plan to debut one new episode of its original series per week, Robert Greenblatt, chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment and the company\u2019s direct-to-consumer business, told Reuters. That mirrors the traditional TV pattern.\n\n\u201cWe like the idea that people watch weekly and look forward to the next episode and talk about it,\u201d Greenblatt said. \u201cNewspapers write about the storylines. There is a sense of a shared experience.\u201d\n\nCreating buzz around a new series will be crucial in the coming weeks and months as several companies jockey to lure customers and keep them paying a monthly fee over the long term.\n\nHBO Max may make some exceptions, according to a source familiar with the company\u2019s strategy, by putting out a few episodes simultaneously to stoke initial interest.\n\nApple, meanwhile, will debut its subscription video service, Apple TV+, on Friday. For dramas \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d and \u201cSee,\u201d and most other Apple series, the company will drop three episodes at the same time, followed by one per week.\n\nThe family-friendly Disney+ will unveil episodes weekly for new series including \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d the first live-action TV show set in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d universe. Disney+ will launch on Nov. 12.\n\n\u2018WAIT AND EXPERIENCE\u2019\n\n\u201cMandalorian\u201d star Pedro Pascal said he believes the once-a-week approach will make watching the show \u201cmore romantic and more classic.\u201d\n\n\u201cBasically you get to sort of wait and experience more collectively, and it just makes it more event television, which it deserves to be,\u201d Pascal said.\n\n\u201cA little courtship never hurt anyone,\u201d added co-star Gina Carano.\n\nBut to some viewers, going a week after a dramatic cliffhanger \u201cseems like it\u2019s old school,\u201d said Brett Sappington, principal analyst at Parks Associates.\n\n\u201cFor some consumers, that can be frustrating,\u201d he said. \u201cExpectations are just different today.\u201d\n\nWhile it started among younger viewers, binge viewing of several episodes is now common among all age groups, Sappington said.\n\nIt also has been adopted by audiences around the world. In surveys by Ampere Analysis, 69 percent of people in the United States said they frequently watch several episodes of the same TV show back to back. The percentage was 66 percent in Britain, 65 percent in France and 46 percent in Germany.\n\nSPIKING AT DEBUT\n\nVarious release strategies can generate hits, according to data from Parrot Analytics, which measures global demand for programming. It found interest in binge-able series generally spikes when they debut and then tapers off, while shows released weekly see interest build over time. Both level off around 10 to 12 weeks.\n\nHBO\u2019s \u201cEuphoria,\u201d for example, released its first installment in June at the same time that Netflix dropped the entire season of \u201cThe Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance.\u201d\n\nGlobal demand for \u201cDark Crystal\u201d peaked in the first week after it premiered, while \u201cEuphoria\u201d saw steady increases after each episode came out, according to Parrot Analytics. It reached its highest point around the episode eight finale.\n\nBoth shows peaked with roughly 18 million daily \u201cdemand expressions,\u201d a combination of viewership, social media mentions and online research about the shows.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Cast member Helen Mirren attends a premiere for the HBO miniseries \u201cCatherine the Great\u201d at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, California, U.S., October 17, 2019.

For reality competition \u201cRhythm + Flow,\u201d the company released four installments at first, three more a week later, and the final three a week after that.\n\nAround the world, Netflix distributes roughly 35 shows on a once-a-week basis, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in October during the company\u2019s earnings webcast. While it does not release audience figures for most of its programming, Sarandos said Netflix customers preferred getting all episodes together.\n\n\u201cWe actually get more viewing and cumulatively more social media buzz, more tweets, more activity on social media, around these shows for the all-at-once model,\u201d Sarandos said.", "description": "In 2013, Netflix Inc shook up television by delivering 13 episodes of \"House of Cards\" in one batch, a move that helped popularize streaming video and fueled a culture of binge watching.", "authors": ["Lisa Richwine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445847081&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0PO", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
