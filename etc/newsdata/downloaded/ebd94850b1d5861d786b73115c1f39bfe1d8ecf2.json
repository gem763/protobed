Some of the stigma comes from a fear of burdening our parents.\n\nIn 2013 TIME Magazine published an article titled \u201cThe Me Me Me Generation: Millennials are lazy, entitled narcissists who still live with their parents.\u201d\n\nMillennials are called many things but here is where the article got it right:\n\nPlenty of millennials live with their parents. I will give them that.\n\nBut there is more... many of these young people are parents themselves, and this is especially true in South Africa's context where the family unit is seen to be changing.\n\nAccording to the 2018 Children, Families and the State report 62% of South African children live in a extended family situation.\n\nThis means that more and more parents are living with their grandchildren - and having a say in their upbringing.\n\nAlso read: 'Living alone is simply unaffordable': One reader shares the financial struggles of needing to share a roof with her in-laws\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons that could explain the expansion of these multi-generational households.\n\nHowever, before you brand millennials as lazy (because society likes to condemn us), apparently today's youth is the most educated generation. Yet we struggle to place a decent paying job, so we can't actually afford to move out of our childhood bedrooms yet.\n\nThe unemployment rate of young people in South Africa stands at 50%, of which 9% are tertiary graduates and 33.4% hold a senior certificate.\n\nIs this why moving out so difficult for millennial parents?\n\nKamva*, a single mom with a three-year-old, still lives with her parents. She says a big part of this decision has to do with finances, and her parents are supportive of her decision.\n\nAlthough she is a Junior Accountant by profession, she says her salary is not enough to cover rent, expenses and a child minder.\n\nShe says as black millennials our parents place a lot of hope for the family's success in our hands.\n\nShe adds that living on her own is not possible yet, as the money she would have otherwise used for rent and other expenses that come with living on your own goes towards household contributions.\n\nAnd she is not expected to stop contributing towards her family's expenses simply because she moved out of home.\n\nPart of her contribution goes towards her dad's car insurance, helps with groceries and is used for other family emergencies, like when her parents need to attend important family gatherings in the Eastern Cape, which costs about R5000 for petrol money alone.\n\nThis is besides the costs that go towards her daughter, as they do not form part of household expenses and Kamva handles them on her own.\n\nTelevision personality Dineo Nchabeleng is also another young parent who is familiar with such a living arrangement.\n\n\n\nAlthough she moved out of her parents' house a year after she had a child, Dineo is familiar with the not-so-empty childhood bedroom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their first grandchild, so everyone is hands on. I know she is in safe hands when I go to work\", she said in an interview with Move magazine.\n\nJoanna Kleovoulou, a clinical psychologist from PyschMatters, says that living at home when you are over 25 years or older \"is a financial decision, as they either have been retrenched and cannot afford to carry a household any longer, or a joint financial decision to share expenses in order to cover costs or to save.\"\n\nAre you a parent still living in your parents' house? Are you a grandparent living in your house with your child and grandchild?\n\nHow do you feel about your living arrangement?\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your letter.
