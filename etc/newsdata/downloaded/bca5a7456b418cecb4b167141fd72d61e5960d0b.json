REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nA USTR spokesman did not offer any further details about the deputy-level talks.\n\nEarlier, U.S. Chamber of Commerce chief executive Tom Donohue said that U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer told business executives that he was seeking a \u201creal agreement\u201d that addresses intellectual property and technology transfer issues first raised by the USTR two years ago.\n\nDonohue, speaking at a news conference to urge congressional approval of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, said that Lighthizer \u201cdid indicate that there was some movement in the direction of purchasing of (U.S.) agricultural products and other issues.\u201d\n\nBut Lighthizer gave no indication that the talks may produce an interim deal with a more limited scope, as suggested by some media reports, Donohue said.\n\nThe head of the biggest U.S. business lobbying group added that it would be difficult to secure an agreement that fully addresses U.S. demands for sweeping changes to China\u2019s intellectual property and technology transfer practices, market access and subsidy issues.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m optimistic about it, I\u2019m also a dead-ass realist and this is not a simple problem,\u201d Donohue said of the new round of talks.\n\nLighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are expected to meet with China\u2019s top negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, in early October.\n\nPresident Donald Trump last week delayed a tariff increase that had been scheduled for Oct. 1 on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods after China also delayed tariffs on some U.S. imports.\n\nThe world\u2019s two largest economies have not held in-person talks since late July towards resolving their 14-month trade war, which has roiled markets, disrupted supply chains and threatened global growth.\n\nEconomic factors are weighing on both sides, said Stephen Kho, former acting chief counsel on China enforcement at USTR who is now a partner at Akin Gump law firm.\n\n\u201cBoth sides are feeling the pain now. So an interim deal could be done, but if they\u2019re looking for a comprehensive deal ... that will be very hard,\u201d Kho said.", "description": "Deputy-level U.S.-China trade talks are scheduled to start in Washington on Thursday, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Monday, paving the way for high-level talks in October aimed at resolving a bitter trade war.", "authors": ["David Lawder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430593277&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1OQ", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
