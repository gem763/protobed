The process is likely to eventually trigger blanket expulsions that would freeze the nation out of Tokyo 2020 and the football World Cup in 2022.\n\nThis week a Wada committee meeting with experts that could have led to fresh sanctions was delayed, but Russia appears resigned to its fate.\n\nYuri Ganus, director of the Moscow-based agency Rusada, told reporters: \"Russia's Olympic squad will be prevented from participating fully in the Games in Tokyo. I think that this will also happen at the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in China... Russia cannot continue any more with its old methods which have made the doping crisis worse. We need to get rid of the idea that the West is trying to put pressure on us. Russia needs to put its own house in order.\"\n\nOn Monday, Wada formally warned Russia it is \"robustly\" investigating \"inconsistencies\" in data finally handed over in January to escape a previous drug cheat ban.", "description": "The head of Russia's anti-doping agency has braced the nation to be banned from next year's Olympics as a fresh investigation into inconsistencies in laboratory data nears its conclusion.", "authors": ["Tom Morgan", "Sports News Correspondent", "James Corrigan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/olympics/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000211135859-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqRLU6RByDcehJVbJAoDuCGTtVi3XDVUMXoSj0InryjE8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
