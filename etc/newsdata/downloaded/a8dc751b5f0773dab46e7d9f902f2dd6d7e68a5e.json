Stay tuned.\n\nThe United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran. I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One. pic.twitter.com/z0iDj2L0Y3 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2019\n\nWhere\u2019d he get that photo? From the moment it appeared on Twitter, people who are practiced at studying satellite images began chattering about the remarkable clarity of it. CNBC asked around. Result:\n\nA U.S. defense official told CNBC that the picture in Trump\u2019s tweet, which appeared to be a snapshot of a physical copy of the satellite image, was included in a Friday intelligence briefing. Experts told CNBC that the shot was likely never meant for public view\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to see stuff this good. He\u2019s not supposed to share it. I\u2019ve honestly never seen an image this sharp,\u201d said Melissa Hanham, deputy director of the Open Nuclear Network and director of the Datayo Project at the One Earth Future Foundation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this before,\u201d said another image analyst to Business Insider. \u201cI know that [the US military has] amazing capabilities, but I don\u2019t know what this is.\u201d You can see what a commercial satellite image of the site looks like by comparison at the top of this NPR story. It\u2019s night and day.\n\nHow did he get a physical copy of the image uploaded to Twitter? Did he \u2026 pull out his smartphone and take a picture of a slide during a briefing? That seemed ludicrous to me, but a Twitter pal points out that you can see what appears to be a flash reflected in the center of the image and the shadow of the person taking the photo on the lower right.\n\nImagine the scene. \u201cI want to take a photo of this!\u201d \u201cNo, wait, Mr. President, the Iranians don\u2019t know that we\u2013\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019ll be great! I\u2019ll post it on social media.\u201d \u201cNo, no, wait!\u201d *click*\n\nExperts immediately set to work drawing inferences from the image. And if they\u2019re drawing inferences, Iranian intelligence is drawing inferences too:\n\n\u201cThe resolution is amazingly high,\u201d says [Ankit] Panda. \u201cI would think it\u2019s probably below well below 20 centimeters, which is much higher than anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Panda believes it was most likely taken by a classified U.S. satellite. But Melissa Hanham, deputy director of the Open Nuclear Network at the One Earth Foundation, believes that the resolution is so high, it may be beyond the physical limits at which satellites can operate. \u201cThe atmosphere is thick enough that after somewhere around 11 to 9 centimeters, things get wonky,\u201d she says. That could mean it was taken by a drone or spy plane, though such a vehicle would be violating Iranian airspace. Hanham also says that the European company Airbus has been experimenting with drones that fly so high, they are technically outside the atmosphere and thus operating outside national boundaries. But she says she doesn\u2019t know whether the U.S. has such a system.\n\nAs president, Trump is free to declassify anything he likes, no matter how reckless he is in doing so. It\u2019s impossible for him to \u201cleak\u201d for criminal purposes. And of course the Iranians are well aware of the details of their own missile site so he\u2019s not telling them anything they don\u2019t know already about the facility by sharing this. What he is telling them \u2014 and everyone else in the world \u2014 is that they need to take greater precautions in concealing secrets from American eyes in the sky than they might have thought were necessary until they saw this photo and realized how granular the detail of our images is.\n\nAnd he might also be inadvertently alerting them that we have aircraft in their airspace that they weren\u2019t aware of until now.\n\nBut did Trump really post this without consulting with anyone? Panda is skeptical.\n\nSo, question: did ODNI sign off on this? If so, why? Smack-talking Iran on Twitter is literally one of the worst reasons to disclose methods. \u2014 Ankit Panda (@nktpnd) August 30, 2019\n\nScavino wouldn\u2019t have tweeted something like this without authorization. And if you look in the upper left of the photo, you\u2019ll see that something has been blacked out, suggesting that it was redacted for publication.\n\nBut if this is all a deliberate release by the Pentagon or CIA, why was it done in such a slapdash manner, with someone taking a snapshot of the missile-site photo? Trump could have asked for a hard copy of the photo to be uploaded and posted by the relevant natsec authority. Then POTUS could have tweeted it with his comment.\n\nAnd why was the photo released at all? If you\u2019re invested in the idea that he\u2019s playing eight-dimensional chess here, showing the Iranians that we know more about their program than they thought, surely that point could have been made to them privately, in a manner that wouldn\u2019t also reveal to Russia and China just how good our atmospheric observation is.\n\nWhat happened here?", "description": "Sensitive.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/i.jpg"}
