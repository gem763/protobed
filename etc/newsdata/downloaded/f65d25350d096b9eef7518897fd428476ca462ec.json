But the bathwater stunt, combined with an earlier gag involving the website PornHub, thrust her into the spotlight this year.\n\nBefore her account was shut down, Delphine had as many as 4.5 million Instagram followers.

She reappeared on Twitter this week to say it was because she had been arrested because she had spray painted the car of someone who had stolen her hamster. Unfortunately, the United Kingdom's Metropolitan Police don't release arrest reports, so Business Insider is unable to corroborate Delphine's story.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the Instagram star Belle Delphine:", "description": "Delphine returned to social media to say she had been arrested after spray painting the car of someone who had stolen her hamster.", "authors": ["Paige Leskin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d31fff68d66420d8126ebcc?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
