According to the conversations captured by Cary Poarch, a lot of his colleagues seem to agree.\n\nBy the way, one or two of them feel strongly enough about this that we must note the Not Safe for Work (language) warning:\n\nIt\u2019s tough to offer one or two pull quotes from this 15-minute video, as there appear to be a half-dozen or more people of significance within CNN who criticize the network. Project Veritas does its best with this random sample, but some of these are just the appetizers for much more substantive criticisms of policy and investment:\n\nPatrick Davis, Manager of Field Operations at CNN: \u201c\u2026I hate seeing what we were and what we could be and what we\u2019ve become. It\u2019s just awful\u2026I mean, we could be so much better than what we are\u2026And the buck stops with him (Zucker).\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t listened to a 9AM call in about 15 years. I just stopped,\u201d complains Manager of Field Operations at CNN Patrick Davis, \u201cJust, I can\u2019t listen to it. It\u2019s all bulls***. It\u2019s all just a bunch of bulls***. And I wish that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d Scott Garber, Senior Field Engineer at CNN: \u201cWe used to cover news. We used to go out and do stories\u2026But Trump is more important.\u201d Adia Jacobs, CNN Technical Operations Supervisor: \u201cWhen Zucker took over it wasn\u2019t until Trump that we ended up being all Trump all the time.\u201d Nick Neville, CNN Media Coordinator: \u201cHe (Zucker) basically said f**k all the other stories.\u201d Mike Brevna, Floor Manager at CNN: \u201cIt\u2019s the Trump Network, dog. It\u2019s like everything is all Trump\u2026they not even thinking about anybody else. They sold themselves to the devil.\u201d Gerald Sisnette, Field Production Supervisor at CNN: \u201cThis is a story that\u2019s not gonna go away\u2026The only way this will go away is when he (Trump) dies. Hopefully soon.\u201d\n\nThat last comment sounds more like frustration over the network\u2019s obsession with Trump than actual animus, but YMMV.\n\nTo be fair, the same criticisms can be levied at other media outlets as well. Davis makes that point when he says there are no more true media outlets in the marketplace. Fox is almost equally obsessed with Trump, only from a position of defending him. MSNBC might actually be worse than CNN when it comes to obsession with Trump, and its parent NBC News isn\u2019t much better. They all seem to be doing exactly what Christian Sierra admits CNN does, which is to manufacture controversy and then market it for the clicks.\n\nFew if any other media outlets are as sanctimonious as CNN, however, except maybe for the Washington Post\u2019s \u201cDemocracy dies in darkness\u201d logo-in-black these days. Few others have transformed themselves so much in the Trump era, and for the purposes of their executives\u2019 own agendas. They still have talented reporters and commentators, but those people are working in an organization whose credibility has been hollowed out by its activists. And even their own employees recognize that problem, as we see from these undercover videos. They also know exactly where that problem originates \u2014 Jeff Zucker.\n\nWill Zucker suffer any consequences for this? I\u2019d doubt it, unless it starts impacting the ratings. Credibility\u2019s great, but advertisers pay for eyeballs on TV and websites.", "description": "\u201cThe only way this will go away is when he (Trump) dies.
