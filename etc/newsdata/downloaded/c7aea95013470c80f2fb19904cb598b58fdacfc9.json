Assuming it exercises the option in full at the top end of the range, the sale could raise up to $6.6 billion before any regular overallotment option is included.\n\nThe company would raise up to $4.8 billion without the upsize option.\n\nProceeds will help AB InBev, the world\u2019s largest brewer, reduce with a debt burden of over $100 billion, accumulated following the purchase of rival SABMiller in late 2016.", "description": "Anheuser-Busch InBev NV kicked off a second attempt to spin off its Asian business in Hong Kong with the launch of an IPO on Wednesday worth up to $6.6 billion in what is poised to be the world's second largest IPO this year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430790219&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0NL-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
