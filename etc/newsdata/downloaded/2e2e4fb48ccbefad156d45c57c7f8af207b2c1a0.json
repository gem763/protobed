Mandatory Credit: Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAllen is 5-0 as the Panthers\u2019 starter dating to 2018, but he\u2019s about to face his toughest test against a talented and complex defense.\n\n1. Saleh a master of disguise\n\nWhile pass rush has been critical to the 49ers\u2019 defensive rise, coordinator Robert Saleh deserves tremendous credit for evolving.\n\nA product of Pete Carroll\u2019s Seattle tree, Saleh brought the Seahawks-style Cover-3 to San Francisco in 2017, with limited effectiveness. He often featured changeups early in games but generally settled into Cover-3, predictability that was hard to overcome without top-end talent.\n\nSaleh now has top-end talent, but he isn\u2019t settling for one base coverage. After introducing more variation last season, he overhauled his scheme this year with a disguise-based approach stemming mostly from two-safety shells. Saleh now employs a variety of Cover-4, Cover-2 and Cover-6 (a combination of 4 and 2), usually with late rotations to maintain disguises until the snap.\n\nThese tactics \u2014 much like Vic Fangio\u2019s in Chicago and Denver \u2014 muddy the quarterback\u2019s reads and put more defenders\u2019 eyes on him, creating takeaway opportunities (13 in six games, T-4th in NFL). Saleh has also brought selective zone blitzes with great effectiveness, another problem for offenses.\n\nAllen has run Norv Turner\u2019s scheme very well and avoided dangerous throws, but he hasn\u2019t faced many shape-shifting defenses yet. Saleh will test Allen\u2019s eyes and discipline, requiring him to confirm the coverage post-snap before making a decision.\n\nLikewise, Allen must protect the ball against a ferocious pass rush. In 10 sacks taken, he has six fumbles.\n\n2. Pressure\u2019s on, Baker\n\nThe New England Patriots have been making quarterbacks see ghosts all season. Sam Darnold just happened to be heard admitting it.\n\nThe Patriots were especially aggressive against the Jets, bringing several Cover-0 blitz variations, often without hiding them presnap. It wasn\u2019t always all-out pressure, however. One of Bill Belichick\u2019s favorite tactics is playing Cover-0 (no deep safety, everyone alone in man coverage) and sending all potential rushers, only to have interior rushers drop out once contacted by a blocker. This essentially guarantees a free rusher while also taking away inside throws.\n\nBelichick might be less aggressive against the Cleveland Browns, given the danger of leaving Odell Beckham one-on-one, but Baker Mayfield will see at least a few Cover-0 looks. He and Freddie Kitchens must have better answers \u2014 both via protections and hot routes \u2014 than Darnold and Adam Gase had on Monday.\n\nEven if those answers work, Mayfield is going to face some pressure. Belichick is too good at scheming free rushers, and the Browns\u2019 O-line remains shaky. Mayfield must be disciplined in his distribution and avoid drifting in the pocket.\n\n3. Two potential Titans stars you may have forgotten\n\nThe 3-4 Tennessee Titans aren\u2019t in great shape, but they\u2019re far from sunk. Ryan Tannehill has stabilized the offense, while an already stacked defense just added another stud up front.\n\nTannehill\u2019s willingness to stay with reads amid pressure and turn throws loose into tight windows is huge for Corey Davis, who some might have already labeled a bust. The 2017 fifth overall pick quietly made major progress last year, but Mariota didn\u2019t find him enough to let him show it.\n\nIn Tannehill\u2019s first start Sunday, Davis made six grabs (on seven targets) for 80 yards and a touchdown, including five tight-window, contested catches. He uses his frame to attack and shield the ball, and he can survive contact at the catch point, bouncing off would-be tacklers at times for chunks of extra yards. With more chances from Tannehill, Davis could become a bonafide No. 1 wideout.\n\nEven more promising Sunday was the debut of first-round rookie D-lineman Jeffery Simmons. Just eight months after ACL surgery, Simmons looked like the potential top-five pick he was before injury.\n\nSimmons saw only 21 defensive snaps, aligning all over the line, and looked thicker than in college, as he\u2019s likely not in game shape yet. But he was extremely disruptive and productive, collecting four tackles (two for loss) and one sack while dominating near the goal line on the Chargers\u2019 failed final drive.\n\nThe sack was aided by DaQuan Jones on a stunt, and Philip Rivers stepped right into Simmons. But Simmons pressured Rivers three other times, despite not playing in obvious passing situations. He\u2019s going to earn more pass-down snaps soon \u2014 he\u2019s too dangerous not to \u2014 and he could get leaner and even more explosive.\n\nFacing the Chargers\u2019 JV O-line was effectively a preseason game. Now Simmons will battle tougher foes against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday, especially stalwart left guard Ali Marpet and scrappy center Ryan Jensen.\n\nWith tough games looming at Carolina and vs. Kansas City before the Week 11 bye, Tennessee likely must beat Tampa Bay.\n\n4. Mr. and Mr. Smith test Chiefs\u2019 protection\n\nWhether it\u2019s Patrick Mahomes or Matt Moore on Sunday night for the Kansas City Chiefs, the starting QB must be highly aware of the Green Bay Packers\u2019 pair of Smiths.\n\nPreston Smith and Za\u2019Darius Smith (unrelated) didn\u2019t reach Derek Carr last week thanks to Oakland\u2019s conservative game plan, but they\u2019ve been a terror since arriving via free agency in March.\n\nPreston is longer and more of an edge bender, while Za\u2019Darius is more physical and versatile, often lining up inside. The pair becomes most dangerous when aligned to the same side, with Preston outside and Za\u2019Darius over the guard. That often prefaces a stunt, with Preston looping inside the upfield rush of Za\u2019Darius and wreaking havoc.\n\nBut they\u2019ve also played off that tendency with a wicked counter. Twice this season, Preston has collected sacks essentially unblocked because he faked a stunt, getting the offensive tackle to turn inside to take Za\u2019Darius, only for Preston to fly off the edge free. It appears Preston is ad-libbing \u2014 rather than the Packers calling a rare \u201ccoffeehouse stunt\u201d (where two players fake inward, then go out) \u2014 but either way, it\u2019s a chore for an O-line to handle.\n\nThe Chiefs remain sturdy at right tackle with Mitchell Schwartz, but left tackle Eric Fisher and left guard Andrew Wiley have missed time. Even if both play, expect Green Bay to align both Smiths to the offense\u2019s left on passing downs.\n\n5. Tough test for Cardinals\u2019 run game\n\nIn Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s pass-heavy, Air Raid offense, the Arizona Cardinals\u2019 run game has been refreshingly effective.\n\nAfter Chase Edmonds (27 carries, 126 yards, three TDs) thrived in place of David Johnson last week, the Cardinals rank 11th in yards per carry (4.85). The scheme has featured a ton of variety, leveraging Kyler Murray\u2019s legs at times but also building core runs off one another, a credit to both Kingsbury and offensive line coach Sean Kugler.\n\nThe sledding will be tough on Sunday, however, against the New Orleans Saints\u2019 dominant defense. Since Sheldon Rankins returned in Week 4, the Saints have allowed just 3.2 yards per carry and just three carries of 10-plus yards (one on a WR reverse).\n\nOf course, the Saints\u2019 pass defense is also terrifying, allowing 5.3 yards per attempt with 11 sacks and two interceptions over the same span. Kingsbury and Murray could be in for a long day.\n\n\u2014By David DeChant (@DavidDeChant), Field Level Media", "description": "With Cam Newton still on the mend, Kyle Allen has another chance to stake his claim to the Carolina Panthers' starting job at the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444616962&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1WS-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
