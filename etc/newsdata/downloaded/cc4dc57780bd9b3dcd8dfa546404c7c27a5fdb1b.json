All three MPs are members of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on Chagos.\n\nA source close to the visit suggested the trip may have been an attempt to bolster support in parliament for continued British sovereignty of the archipelago.\n\nThe UK retained possession of the Chagos archipelago after Mauritius gained independence in 1968. Around 1,500 inhabitants were deported in the years up to 1973 so the largest island, Diego Garcia, could be leased to the US for the airbase. They have never been allowed to resettle.\n\nWest, MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, has long campaigned for the Chagossians\u2019 right to return to their homeland. \u201cWe went to see how a resettlement programme might be possible and what it might be like to live there,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe best solution is for the UK government to resettle the Chagossians.\n\n\u201cWe travelled with a Foreign Office official and a member of staff who organises heritage tours [for exiled islanders]. The UK officials are doing a very good job in terms of the environment and looking after wildlife.\n\n\u201cWe flew in on a British military plane to Bahrain which was six hours; then went out the next morning to Diego Garcia which was another six hours.\n\n\u201cAt one stage we had a 13-hour boat trip to the island of Peros Banhos. I was very sea sick \u2026 We had to swim ashore because no one can take a boat over the coral. There were a dozen Royal Marines with us.\u201d\n\nWest said they had also met a UK customs official who told of bringing a Sri Lankan vessel illegally fishing for tuna and sharks that was brought before magistrates on the island and had the fish confiscated.\n\nShe continued: \u201cOn the last day we met senior US officials \u2026 that would be the [focus] of any resettlement. There\u2019s no reason why the community couldn\u2019t seek work at the base.\u201d\n\nIn May the UK was ordered to hand back the Chagos Islands to Mauritius \u201cas rapidly as possible\u201d after the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that British occupation is illegal.\n\nAlthough the majority decision by the ICJ was only advisory, it was a humiliating blow to Britain\u2019s prestige. Since then the UN general assembly has set a six-month deadline, expiring on 22 November, for the withdrawal of the British colonial administration.\n\nThe prime minister, Boris Johnson, suffered one of his heaviest defeats at the UN as foreign secretary over the legality of British occupation of BIOT.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, a former chair of the APPG, has condemned the UK government for defying the ICJ ruling. West said she had told the Labour leader of her trip \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m sure he would have loved to come along\u201d \u2013 adding that she hoped the visit was a sign the Foreign Office was changing its mind about resettlement.\n\nPope Francis raised hopes of resettlement among exiles on his visit to Mauritius this week by referring to the Chagos Islands rather than using the UK\u2019s preferred term of BIOT.\n\nDavid Snoxell, co-ordinator of the APPG and former UK high commissioner to Mauritius, said: \u201cFor as long as BIOT remains British it is unlikely that Chagossians will be allowed to return, but under Mauritian sovereignty the Islanders can do so. Mauritius has made it clear that it will organise and contribute to the cost of resettlement. That is why resettlement and restoration of the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius go hand in hand.\u201d\n\nProfessor Phillippe Sands QC, who represented Mauritius at the ICJ, said: \u201cThe failure of the UK to consult with Mauritius is clearly inconsistent with the ruling and overwhelming support in the UN for the position of Mauritius and the right of Chagossians to return.\u201d\n\nRossindell, chair of the APPG, could not be contacted for comment.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Foreign Office-run trip thought to be first formal parliamentary visit to the disputed territory", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cde2dcab8bb9008f4f4e04960f65c4be6ebf65f9/0_204_6126_3676/master/6126.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ed510ee3f42609cf0c8045cd6c99e82", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
