Some lawmakers and the founding Cobham family, which retains a small stake, have opposed the proposed purchase by U.S. private-equity firm Advent International Corp. Earlier this week, shareholders overwhelmingly approved it.\n\nThe British government has rarely inserted itself in such deals, though it has recently strengthened its powers of review amid similar new scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe. That new sensitivity has come amid a wave of acquisitions in strategic industries by Chinese companies.\n\nThe move represents a significant departure for the U.K., which has traditionally had a hands-off approach to other big deals. London, for instance, didn\u2019t stand in the way of a $32 billion deal in 2016 by Japan\u2019s SoftBank to buy Arm Holdings, a tech giant whose chip designs are in most of the world\u2019s smartphones. The government did, though, secure a legally binding commitment from SoftBank to retain Arm\u2019s U.K. headquarters. It is in talks with Advent about securing similar pledges.\n\nThe government on Wednesday said it had triggered an investigation of the deal. British competition officials will now prepare a report on the national-security aspects of the transaction and detail their findings by Oct. 29.\n\n\u201cFollowing careful consideration of the proposed takeover of Cobham, I have issued an intervention notice on the grounds of national security,\u201d said Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom. \u201cThe government\u2019s goals are to support private sector innovation whilst safeguarding the public interest.\u201d\n\nCobham employs about 10,000 people, including around 1,700 in the U.K. It generated revenue of \u00a31.86 billion ($2.32 billion) for 2018, with more than half its sales in the U.S. U.K. military spending accounting for less than 5% of its business.\n\nA spokesman for Advent said the Boston-based firm was \u201ccommitted to being a responsible steward\u201d of the company, and would continue to engage constructively with the government as part of the review.\n\nA spokesman for Cobham said the company would clarify its activities in the context of national security and \u201cassuage the concerns that have been expressed by certain shareholders.\u201d\n\nThe U.K. has long had the power to intervene in transactions but rarely does. Last year, it moved to bolster its powers to block foreign acquisitions of British companies, patents and other assets that it believes could compromise the country\u2019s national security. Since 2002 the government has intervened on nine occasions to review takeovers on national security grounds.\n\nThe new rules, which paved the way for the government to intervene in a wider range of sectors and small transactions, were widely seen as a response to China\u2019s appetite for technology and intellectual property. The U.S. and Germany have also boosted powers to scrutinize transactions.\n\nWrite to Peter Stiff at peter.stiff@wsj.com and Simon Clark at simon.clark@wsj.com", "description": "The U.K. halted the $5 billion sale of a British defense firm to an American investor pending further government review, a rare move for a country that hasn\u2019t typically intervened in big, cross-border deal making.", "authors": ["Peter Stiff", "Simon Clark", "Peter.Stiff Wsj.Com", "Simon.Clark Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108132/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
