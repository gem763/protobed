In particular, he asked Mr. Wray for \u201cappropriate follow-up\u201d with a former Yale classmate of Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s who had information that might have buttressed a claim by another classmate, Deborah Ramirez. Ms. Ramirez had alleged that Justice Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken dormitory party in 1983, their freshman year. Justice Kavanaugh has vigorously denied all the allegations against him.\n\nThe bureau pledged to look into the Ramirez allegations, but Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s detractors pointed to the Coons letter as evidence that her claims were given short shrift, and that corroborating witnesses were ignored. The F.B.I. declined to comment on Monday, but pointed to Mr. Wray\u2019s testimony last year before Congress, where he defended the bureau\u2019s handling of the supplemental investigation into Justice Kavanaugh, noting that it had been directed by the White House, which had asked for a narrow inquiry. Under standard protocol, the bureau responds to background investigation requests from the White House, not members of Congress.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Kavanaugh-Fbi.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
