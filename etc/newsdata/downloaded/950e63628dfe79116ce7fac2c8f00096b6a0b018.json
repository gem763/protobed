This particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over. But really think about where we\u2019ll be: vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now. And these big issues from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process. I\u2019m running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now.\n\nFor Buttigieg, it\u2019s largely a matter of \u201cturning the page\u201d on the Trump era. Elsewhere he\u2019s used the metaphor of \u201cchanging the channel\u201d away from this \u201chorror show.\u201d After this, Buttigieg promises to heal the country\u2019s divisions while also getting to work on its challenges.\n\nBut in spite of his recognition that we face \u201cbig issues,\u201d for Buttigieg, this need for healing actually argues for tempering our policy ambitions. Buttigieg basically said just this, noting that we should not attempt Medicare-for-all because after Trump, our country will be \u201chorrifyingly polarized,\u201d and expanding Medicare voluntarily can achieve universal health care without further exacerbating that polarization.\n\nAD\n\nIn short: Too much ambition means more division, and we\u2019ve already got as much of that as we can take.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how fundamentally different a reading that is from that offered by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). She declared that the only way Democrats can beat Trump is by \u201caddressing head-on\u201d the fact that \u201cthe wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy,\u201d adding:\n\nAD\n\nPeople in our own party don\u2019t want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what\u2019s broken and we show how to fix it. ... Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight.\n\nThat\u2019s a fairly direct indictment of the caution offered by Buttigieg \u2014 and Joe Biden, whose agenda is somewhat more liberal than is commonly acknowledged, but who nonetheless is making his No. 1 mission to \u201crestore\u201d the country\u2019s unity after Trump\u2019s racism tore it apart.\n\nAD\n\nIn Warren\u2019s diagnosis, the problem is oligarchic capture of our political economy. It isn\u2019t just that vowing to genuinely take on this capture is necessary to mobilize the grass-roots energy to defeat Trump but also that it threatens to persist as a defining feature of the After Trump era.\n\nOver and over, Warren says shrinking from \u201cbig fights\u201d is the wrong thing to be signaling an intention to do \u2014 contra Buttigieg, the prospect of deep divisions after Trump calls for more ambitious reform efforts. Thus Warren proposes deep reforms to rid Washington of corruption and to restructure the economy.\n\nAD\n\nIf anything, Bernie Sanders went even more decisively in that direction. He argued that the way to end the \u201chatred\u201d and \u201cdivision\u201d inflicted on the country by Trump is with \u2026\n\nAD\n\n\u2026 an agenda that works for every man, woman, and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1 percent. A progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country.\n\nTransforming the country, Sanders noted, means dealing with the stark facts that \u201c87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured,\u201d that \u201chalf of our people are living paycheck to paycheck\u201d and that we face \u201cthe existential threat of climate change.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s often suggested that the fundamental divide among Democrats is between those who see Trump as merely a passing aberration \u2014 after which something resembling normalcy can be restored \u2014 and those who see him as a symptom of much more deeply rooted systemic problems with our economy and democracy.\n\nBut the divide might be better expressed this way: It\u2019s between those who think the deep ferment of the moment calls for a combination of some sort of unspecified unifying salve and a promise of minimal post-Trump disruption, and those who see it as an opportunity \u2014 to jolt Americans into an awareness that things are so badly off track that we need to try something much bigger.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Underneath the battling is a fundamental divide over what will continue ailing us.", "authors": ["Greg Sargent", "Opinion Writer Covering National Politics", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cG50uVPf17vpD7_jM5-D7b0sXI8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RJLTEHXQHUI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
