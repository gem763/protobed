In Privacyland right now, the \u201cdata as property\u201d argument is bubbling up frequently. In a comprehensive piece for CNET, David Priest argues that \u201ctreating your data like property would be terrible .\u201d (Opinion contributor Sarah Jeong argued similarly here in July.) He also offers a potential explanation for Yang\u2019s not answering my question:\n\nYang\u2019s actual policy suggestions don\u2019t treat data like property. He proposes the rights for you to be informed of data collection and use, to opt out, to be told if a website has data on you, to be \u201cforgotten,\u201d to be informed if your data changes hands, to be informed of data breaches and to download all your data to transfer it elsewhere.\n\nPriest suggests maybe Yang is just using the wrong language. \u201cYang is correct that we have a claim\u201d to our data, he writes. \u201cThe question we should all keep asking and attempting to answer is, \u2018How can we make that claim?\u2019\u201d\n\nAt One Zero, Will Oremus examines the idea of how much our privacy is really worth and concludes that \u201cit\u2019s probably fruitless to try to pinpoint with a single number the value of privacy.\u201d He suggests that a better frame may be to look at privacy like a human right, which he defines as \u201csomething everyone deserves, whether they fully grasp its value or not.\u201d\n\nOr how about another metaphor? A number of data dividend advocates argue that \u201cdata is the new oil,\u201d meaning that tech companies extract our personal information, much like oil companies extract the natural resource from the ground. Their data dividend idea is somewhat based on Alaska\u2019s Permanent Fund, which pays out a yearly sum ($1,606 in 2019) to eligible state residents based on oil revenues. In our interview, Yang used this phrase, too.\n\nI think \u201cdata is the new oil\u201d misses the point slightly. But the environmental metaphor \u2014 especially pollution \u2014 is a helpful model. In an interview, a former Federal Trade Commission chief technology officer, Ashkan Soltani, suggested a solution for data similar to a carbon tax for clean air. His analogy of choice was logging:\n\nA long time ago logging entities discovered and harvested a resource at scale before anyone else and one of their advantages was the ability to pollute. But it was only after some time that people said, \u201cwait, that\u2019s my land, too\u201d and mandated that they either needed to be able to restrict the ability to use it or have some sort of retribution in the form of a tax or carbon credit.\n\nPollution is also a handy way to think about why our data ought to be kept safe by default. As Oremus put it, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like being asked how much you\u2019d be willing to pay for your drinking water to be kept poison-free.\u201d\n\nNo wonder we\u2019re all fed up.\n\n[If you\u2019re online \u2014 and, well, you are \u2014 chances are someone is using your information.

But I hadn\u2019t really understood just how egregious the company\u2019s data security practices were until last Friday, when Jane Lytvynenko at BuzzFeed News first shared some snippets from the class-action suit from last January.\n\nI went through the whole document, which alleges that Equifax \u201cfailed to take some of the most basic precautions to protect its computer systems from hackers.\u201d", "description": "Privacy is a 2020 issue, even if the campaigns won\u2019t address it.", "authors": ["Charlie Warzel"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/opinion/22warzelWeb/22warzelWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
