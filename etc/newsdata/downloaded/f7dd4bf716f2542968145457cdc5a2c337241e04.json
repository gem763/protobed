Harry had no chance.\n\n\u201cShe travelled on 350 to 400 yards on the wrong side of the road. It was a head-on collision \u2013 we later lost him in hospital.\u201d\n\nMs Charles said the family did not know how to start grieving properly without justice being served.\n\n\u201cEveryone loved him, we\u2019re utterly broken inside and out, everything hurts day and night, it\u2019s an effort to do anything, I ache from it, every limb, every internal organ hurts.\n\nA crowd-funding campaign, \u201cJustice4Harry\u201d has so far raised more than \u00a35,000 to help the family.\n\nMeanwhile, police chiefs have written to the US embassy in London to demand immunity is waived.\n\nNick Adderley, chief constable for Northamptonshire Police, said US authorities had been appealed to in \u201cthe strongest terms\u201d to apply a waiver and \u201callow the justice process to take place\u201d.\n\nWhen asked whether the UK wants the US to hand over the diplomat\u2019s wife, prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cThe details of this case are extremely concerning and the foreign secretary has discussed it with the US ambassador.\n\n\"The justice process should be allowed to take place and we urge the US to reconsider their decision. The prime minister offers his condolences to the Dunn family. This was a tragic set of events which no family should have to experience.\u201d\n\nA US Embassy spokesman has said questions over any waiver of immunity in the case of the wife of a US diplomat who left the UK after becoming a suspect in a fatal road crash would be \u201cconsidered carefully\u201d.\n\nThe embassy spokesman said: \u201cWe express our deepest sympathies and offer condolences to the family of the deceased in this tragic traffic accident.\n\n\u201cAny questions regarding a waiver of the immunity with regard to our diplomats and their family members overseas in a case like this receive intense attention at senior levels and are considered carefully ... immunity is rarely waived.\n\n\u201cThe US Embassy has been and will continue to be in close contact with appropriate British officials.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by PA\n\nRead more\n\nUS diplomat\u2019s wife suspected of involvement in deadly crash leaves UK\n\nTwin sons of ambassador \u2018protected by immunity\u2019 after attack on boy\n\nFormer Qatari PM \u2018claims diplomatic immunity over torture allegations\u2019\n\nKim Sengupta: Diplomatic immunity rules have many interpretations\n\nA diplomatic immunity to defeat", "description": "The diplomat\u2019s wife suspected of fatally hitting a British teen and returning to the United States without facing charges has been revealed as Anne Sacoolas.The 42-year-old, whose identity was revealed by Sky News, is believed to have left the UK before she could be charged with causing the death of", "authors": ["Corazon Miller"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JpzrgR.nVSuoWsRoQvtHNA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/dd9f242886e902aa98e6c2254e09727f", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
