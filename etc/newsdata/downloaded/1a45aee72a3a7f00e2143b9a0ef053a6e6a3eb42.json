Existing investors Illuminate Ventures and GingerBread Capital also participated in this round.\n\nThe company says that it saw its revenue grow by 4x in the first half of 2019 compared to the same time period last year. Without a baseline, that\u2019s not exactly a meaningful number for a startup founded in 2018, of course, but sales cycles in the enterprise are notoriously long and the company does have a number of marquee customers like Shell, Walmart and Cisco.\n\nThe Contentstack founding team, Neha Sampat, Nishant Patel and Matthew Baier, recently sold Built.io to Software AG . \u201cWith Contentstack, the opportunity feels even larger, but there is also a strong sense of urgency,\u201d said Sampat when I asked her about why she decided to raise at this point, which comes relatively late for a company with Contentstack\u2019s ambitions. \u201cBeing able to do more right now and scale the company\u2019s operations to match the opportunity right in front of us required more resources than the company\u2019s organic growth would provide us.\u201d\n\nSampat also noted that she believes that brands are not realizing that their customers don\u2019t want billboards but customized experiences across channels. Yet, at the same time, they often don\u2019t know what\u2019s working and how to get the most value out of the content they create.\n\n\u201cThe belief that a single platform or product can \u2018do it all\u2019 is being replaced with the realization you can do more, better by bringing together the best technologies the market has to offer,\u201d she said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t an option before, because integrations were so complex and clunky. But now, with the emergence of extensible content experience platforms, companies can actually get to market FASTER using this approach, compared to using a single-vendor approach that wasn\u2019t built for the modern era.\u201d\n\nThe company tells me that it is getting traction across industries, but retail, travel/hospitality, sports/entertainment and tech are doing especially well.\n\nLike most companies at the Series A stage, Contentstack says it will use the new funding to scale its sales and marketing team and build out its partner ecosystem and community around the product. Sampat also tells me that the company plans to expand beyond its core regions of the U.S., India and Europe by moving into the APAC region in the first half of 2020, mostly with a focus on Australia and New Zealand.", "description": "Contentstack, a startup that offers a headless CMS platform for enterprises, today announced that it has raised a $31.5 million Series A round led by Insight Partners.
