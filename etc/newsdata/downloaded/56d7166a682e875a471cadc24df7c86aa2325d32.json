And there are reasons why she may have chosen to punt on another run for her House seat.\n\nShe faced a formidable primary challenge from Hawaii state Sen. Kai Kahele, who has repeatedly criticized Gabbard for her absence from her congressional duties while on the campaign trail. Meanwhile, she has transferred most of the money for her House campaign to her presidential bid, leaving her reelection account strapped for cash.\n\nStill, the suspicion that Gabbard may be eyeing a third-party or independent presidential campaign underscores a sort of wariness of the Hawaii congresswoman among some Democrats, who see her as unpredictable and at times willing to turn on her own party.\n\nShe has repeatedly broken with Democrats on foreign policy issues and drew widespread criticism for a secret 2017 visit with Syrian President Bashar Assad, whom U.S. officials have accused of being a war criminal. Congressional leaders were not made aware of that meeting until after the fact.\n\nShe has also taken aim at her party in recent weeks, accusing the Democratic National Committee (DNC) of \u201crigging\u201d the nominating contest and threatening to boycott an Oct. 15 presidential primary debate in protest. Ultimately, she chose to participate in that debate.\n\nAnd during an appearance on Sean Hannity Sean Patrick HannityRetired four-star general blasts White House over NYTimes, WaPost cancelations Senate GOP introduces resolution condemning House impeachment inquiry White House urges federal agencies to cancel subscriptions to NYT, WaPost MORE\u2019s Fox News show last week, Gabbard criticized what she said was a lack of transparency in the House impeachment inquiry, remarks that some Democrats saw as echoing Republican talking points.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just whether she\u2019s a loyal Democrat. The issue is whether she\u2019s prepared to stand up to the corruption and incompetence of the Trump presidency,\u201d said Robert Zimmerman, a DNC member and Democratic fundraiser. \u201cIf she runs as a third party, she\u2019ll be an enabler to his reelection.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats have sharpened their attacks on Gabbard in recent weeks, raising the alarm over what they see as suspicious online efforts to amplify the congresswoman\u2019s criticism of Democratic detractors and rival campaigns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not on Twitter getting attacked by real people when Tulsi and I have a spat or a disagreement,\u201d said Bakari Sellers, a top surrogate for Sen.

This isn\u2019t rocket science. This is something we\u2019ve seen before.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence of coordination between Gabbard\u2019s campaign and the online bot networks, and experts note that bot activity is typically aimed at sowing discord and divisions among a broad array of groups.\n\nBut lingering concerns about online disinformation campaigns and foreign interference in U.S. elections has put many Democrats on high alert, creating a flashpoint in the party\u2019s presidential race with Gabbard at the center of it.\n\nClinton said earlier this month that Gabbard is the \u201cfavorite of the Russians\u201d to win the Democratic nomination next year and suggested that Republicans were \u201cgrooming\u201d her for a third-party run in hopes of undermining the Democrats\u2019 eventual nominee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Clinton said on the podcast \u201cCampaign HQ.\u201d She did not mention Gabbard by name in the interview, but a spokesperson for Clinton later confirmed that she was referring to Gabbard.\n\nClinton\u2019s remarks drew a furious rebuke from Gabbard, who accused the former secretary of State of launching a campaign to smear her reputation and undermine her political prospects because of her willingness to break from the Democratic establishment.\n\n\u201cIf they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone,\u201d Gabbard said in a video message to supporters earlier this month. \u201cAnd in fact that\u2019s exactly the message that they want to get across to you: That if you stand up against Hillary and the party power brokers, if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message.\u201d\n\nThe concerns about a possible third-party presidential run partly reflect the lingering belief among some Democrats that Jill Stein, the Green Party\u2019s 2016 presidential candidate, managed to pull just enough votes away from Clinton in critical states \u2014 such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 to hand Trump the election.\n\nThe number of votes Stein received in those states was larger than Trump\u2019s margin of victory over Clinton. And some Democrats worry that Gabbard, who has a higher national profile than Stein did, would have a similar effect on the general election if she were to run as a third-party candidate.\n\n\u201cI think the possibility of [Gabbard] running as a third party is very, very real and it should concern all of us,\u201d one DNC member said. \u201cLook what Jill Stein did to Hillary Clinton. She was the difference in three states.\u201d\n\nDespite Gabbard\u2019s insistence that she has ruled out a third-party campaign, some Democrats remain skeptical. Sellers said there was still plenty of time for the congresswoman to change her mind.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust anything she says in that regard,\u201d Sellers said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve seen that before, but I think many of the concerns that Hillary Clinton and myself had about congresswoman Gabbard are proving to be true and I think that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Gabbard\u2019s campaign said that the congresswoman had been \u201cvery clear\u201d about her intentions for 2020 and referred The Hill to a brief question-and-answer session between her and reporters last week.\n\nAsked if there were any circumstances under which she would change her mind about a third-party presidential run, Gabbard was blunt.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cAnswer\u2019s still the same. Nope.\u201d", "description": "Democrats are growing increasingly suspicious of Rep.
