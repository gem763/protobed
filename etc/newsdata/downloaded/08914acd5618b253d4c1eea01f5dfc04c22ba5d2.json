REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nJohnson had previously said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than ask for any extension to the Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nBut he was compelled, by a law passed last month by opponents, to send a letter to the bloc asking to push back the deadline to Jan. 31 after lawmakers thwarted his attempt to pass his EU divorce deal on Saturday.\n\nA government source said Johnson sent a total of three letters to Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council: a photocopy of the text that the law, known as the Benn Act, forced him to write; a cover note from Britain\u2019s EU envoy saying the government was simply complying with that law; and a third letter in which Johnson said he did not want an extension.\n\n\u201cI have made clear since becoming Prime Minister and made clear to parliament again today, my view, and the Government\u2019s position, that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us,\u201d Johnson said in the third letter, published on Twitter by the Financial Times\u2019 Brussels correspondent.\n\nJohnson, for whom delivering Brexit is key to his plan to hold an early election, said he was confident that the process of getting the Brexit legislation through Britain\u2019s parliament would be completed before Oct. 31, according to the letter.\n\nTusk said he had received the request from Johnson.\n\n\u201cI will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told Johnson that Paris needed swift clarification on the situation after Saturday\u2019s vote, an official at the French presidency told Reuters.\n\n\u201cHe signalled a delay would be in no one\u2019s interest,\u201d the official said.\n\nHowever, it was unlikely that the EU\u2019s 27 members states would refuse Britain\u2019s delay request.\n\nJOHNSON PLAN TIPPED ON HEAD\n\nJohnson had hoped that Saturday would see recalcitrant lawmakers finally back the divorce deal he agreed with EU leaders this week and end three years of political deadlock since the 2016 referendum vote to leave the bloc.\n\nInstead, lawmakers voted 322 to 306 in favour of an amendment that turned Johnson\u2019s planned finale on its head by obliging him to ask the EU for a delay, and increasing the opportunity for opponents to frustrate Brexit.\n\nJohnson has previously promised that he would take the country out of the bloc on Oct. 31, without explaining how he would do this while also complying with the Benn Act.\n\n\u201cI will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so,\u201d he told parliament after lawmakers backed the amendment on Saturday.\n\nOpposition politicians accused him of believing he was above the law.\n\n\u201cJohnson is a Prime Minister who is now treating Parliament and the Courts with contempt,\u201d John McDonnell, the opposition Labour Party\u2019s finance spokesman said.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks ahead of a vote on his renegotiated Brexit deal, on what has been dubbed \"Super Saturday\", in the House of Commons in London, Britain October 19, 2019. \u00a9UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/Handout via REUTERS\n\n\u201cHis juvenile refusal to even sign the letter confirms what we always suspected that Johnson with his arrogant sense of entitlement considers he is above the law and above accountability.\u201d\n\nScotland\u2019s highest court is due to consider on Monday a legal challenge that had sought to force Johnson to comply with the Benn Act. The court said earlier this month that government lawyers had given formal legal statements that he would abide by the Benn Act and it would be a serious matter if he did not.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson promised #Scottish court he would comply with #BennAct & not seek to frustrate it. Looks like he\u2019s breaking both promises,\u201d Joanna Cherry, a Scottish National Party lawmaker involved in the case said on Twitter.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson sent an unsigned letter to the European Union requesting a delay to Britain's exit from the bloc and also said he did not want the extension after his latest Brexit setback in parliament on Saturday.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442805698&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0MV", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
