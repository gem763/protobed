The company will keep selling mint, menthol and tobacco flavours. (Bloomberg)\n\nTalking point: The move partially preempts the FDA\u2019s plan to ban all flavoured vaping liquids\u2014regulations on which Juul promised not to lobby the Trump administration in September. Juul has previously made changes to its practices in advance of new rules. In November 2018, it pulled most flavoured pods from brick-and-mortar stores in the U.S. amid reports that the FDA was set to announce a similar requirement. In Canada, Nova Scotia and British Columbia are considering provincial bans on flavoured products. The federal Vaping Products Act, the country\u2019s first vaping law, already prohibits the promotion of pods flavoured like desserts, candy, soft drinks or energy drinks. Lisa Hutniak, director of communications for Juul in Canada, said the company follows local regulations wherever it operates, and \u201cbelieves flavoured products can play an important role in helping adult smokers move away from combustible cigarettes.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre", "Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
