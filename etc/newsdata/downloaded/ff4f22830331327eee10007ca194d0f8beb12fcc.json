It also prohibited white South Africans from selling property to blacks or allowing them to rent parcels on their land.\n\nAs Sol Plaatje wrote in his Native Life in South Africa shortly after the act\u2019s introduction, existing tenancy contracts could thus not be legally renewed.\n\nViolating the act would entail a fine of up to 100 pounds \u2013 a considerable amount of money at the time \u2013 or imprisonment or hard labour for up to six months.\n\nGovernment sought to prohibit the common practice at the time of whites engaging in mutually-beneficial proprietary arrangements with black South Africans.\n\nThe Act also created the Natives Land Commission, tasked with determining which areas the above principle would and would not apply to.\n\nIt applied everywhere in the meantime, except in the native reserves.\n\nCrucially, the act gave government the power to expropriate any land if the owners did not agree to comply with this scheme of social engineering.\n\nPlaatje wrote that many white farmers and black tenants continued entering into mutually beneficial verbal arrangements because they were unaware of the Natives Land Act coming into operation, and thus exposed themselves to serious penalties.\n\nCooperation and transaction between white and black was effectively outlawed. The law stood in the way of non-racialism.\n\nAnd today we risk going down the same path.\n\nThe constitutional protection for property rights introduced in the 1990s ensured that all South Africans would be entitled to own property where they pleased, and that if that property is seized by the State, compensation would be paid.\n\nThe Constitution recognised the necessity of restitution of property, which is a matter of justice.\n\nWhere it can be shown that property was taken \u2013 and the apartheid state kept clear records of its seizures of property \u2013 it must be returned to its legitimate owners or their descendants.\n\nUnder government\u2019s proposed regime of expropriation without compensation, the focus will shift from the strengthening of property rights for all South Africans, particularly black South Africans, to vesting more power in the hands of the State.\n\nGovernment justifies this almost exclusively on racialist rhetoric, just like the government in 1913 did.\n\nThe justice that the Constitution calls for will be replaced by political expediency.\n\nExpropriation without compensation will benefit nobody other than the ruling elite and their cronies, and certainly not the poorest of our society.\n\nIt has been shown conclusively that strong protections for private property rights produce wealth.\n\nThe Fraser Institute\u2019s Economic Freedom of the World report consistently ranks those countries with such protections in the top quartile of its index.\n\nThe World Justice Project\u2019s Rule of Law Index, furthermore, measures governments\u2019 respect for property rights and makes clear that providing adequate compensation when property is expropriated is fundamental to upholding the rule of law.\n\nWhen both these indices are compared with measures of prosperity like the United Nations\u2019 Human Development Index, the most prosperous countries are those that uphold and respect private property rights and the rule of law.\n\nThe Fraser Institute\u2019s index even shows that the poorest 10% in free-market societies earn around seven times more than the poorest 10% in societies with controlled markets.\n\nBut private property is not only a key ingredient for the prosperity of all South Africans. It is also a fundamental part of human dignity.\n\nWithout the ability to keep and use the fruits of our labour, we lose the ability to decide for and take responsibility for ourselves.\n\nProperty rights are not some tool for commercial exploitation, but are an intrinsically human institution without which we cannot progress.\n\nThe Bill of Rights protects this institution, and has been consistently undermined over the last few years as South Africa\u2019s declined ranking in both the economic freedom and Rule of Law indices shows.\n\nCivil society must close ranks around the Constitution and its guarantee of protected private property, and tell government \u201cnever again.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Martin van Staden is Head of Legal Policy at the Free Market Foundation and is pursuing a Master of Laws at the University of Pretoria.
