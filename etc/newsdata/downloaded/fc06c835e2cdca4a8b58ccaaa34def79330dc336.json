Trump used an altered NOAA map of Hurricane Dorian\u2019s path as a visual aid while speaking reporters in the Oval Office last week.\n\nThen, an unsigned statement released by NOAA late Friday disavowed the Sept. 1 tweet by the Birmingham station of the National Weather Service that had sought to correct Trump's claim.\n\n\"From Wednesday, August 28, through Monday, September 2, the information provided by NOAA and the National Hurricane Center to President Trump and the wider public demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama,\" NOAA wrote in a statement Friday, that also pointed to a number of its advisories during that period.\n\n\"The Birmingham National Weather Service\u2019s Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time,\" NOAA also said in the statement.\n\nMore: Trump and Joe Walsh both fundraise off of #SharpieGate as NOAA issues statement\n\n\u201cThe NWS Forecaster(s) corrected any public misunderstanding in an expert and timely way, as they should,\u201d NOAA\u2019s Craig McLean wrote in an email to his agency colleagues Sunday, according to the Washington Post.\u201cThere followed, last Friday, an unsigned news release from 'NOAA\u2019 that inappropriately and incorrectly contradicted the NWS forecaster. My understanding is that this intervention to contradict the forecaster was not based on science but on external factors including reputation and appearance, or simply put, political.\u201d\n\nAfter pointing out how the episode raises questions about trust in the agency's information, possible danger to the public as a result and the agency's scientific integrity policy, he continued: \u201cI have a responsibility to pursue these truths,\u201d NOAA's acting chief scientist also wrote. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump references a map held by acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan while talking to reporters following a briefing from officials about Hurricane Dorian in the Oval Office at the White House on September 04, 2019, in Washington, D.C. More\n\nThe New York Times also reported Monday that Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross threatened to fire top employees at NOAA after the NWS\u2019s Birmingham station contradicted President Trump's claim about Hurricane Dorian's path and Alabama.\n\nAccording to the Times, Ross confronted acting NOAA Administrator Neil Jacobs by phone, demanding the agency fix the contradiction of Trump. Jacobs refused the request and was told by Ross that top NOAA political appointees would be fired if difference with Trump's claim was not rectified.\n\nA Commerce Department spokesperson has denied the Times report in a statement provided to CNN.\n\n\"The New York Times story is false,\" the spokesperson said. \"Secretary Ross did not threaten to fire any NOAA staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: SharpieGate: NOAA reportedly to investigate effort to bolster Trump", "description": "NOAA's acting chief scientist is reportedly investigating an unsigned statement issued Friday by the agency which raises questions about trust in the agency's information, possible danger to the public as a result and the agency's scientific integrity policy.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vuL_.0yfFKtdbKIzqinMlg--~B/aD0zMDAwO3c9NDczMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/ce55019ab9ec342ed8f85bda2ad90291", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
