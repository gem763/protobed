A look at the man who might be Miley Cyrus' new flame", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Teen sensation Cody Simpson talks about using tech for home schooling.\n\nHe's an Australian heartthrob. He's penned an autobiography. And now, he might be Miley Cyrus' newest flame.\n\nCody Simpson, 22, is a self-described \"musician, poet, environmentalist,\" as per his Instagram bio, who made a name for himself as a pop singer when he was teenager. Last week, the \"Surfboard\" crooner made waves when a video surfaced of him kissing Miley Cyrus in a Los Angeles health food store.\n\nCyrus criticized those judging her for the incident in lengthy Twitter missives Friday, writing, \"Can't I just have a kiss and acai bowl?\"\n\nLast year, Simpson made music as part of the band Cody Simpson & The Tide, releasing music videos for the songs \"Daybreak,\" \"Don't Let Me Go\" and \"Underwater.\" He also made his Broadway debut as Dimitri in the musical \"Anastasia.\"\n\nHere's a look at what else we know about Simpson.\n\nHe's had a 'celebrity crush' on Miley Cyrus since 'childhood'\n\nThough their kiss went public recently, Cyrus, 26, has been on Simpson's mind for a while.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Fuse, Simpson confessed he's always had a celebrity crush on the \"Hannah Montana\" star.\n\n\"Miley Cyrus has always been, always been my childhood celebrity crush,\" he said. \"I knew all the words to her songs, I'm not gonna lie. I'm not ashamed about it at all. I was a big Miley Cyrus fan, and I think she will always be the most date-able Disney star.\"\n\nMore: Miley Cyrus slams slut-shaming critics after Cody Simpson kiss: 'Get used to me dating'\n\nHe'll 'always' love ex Gigi Hadid\n\nSimpson is no stranger to romance in the public eye, having previously dated model Gigi Hadid.\n\nBack when they were together, Simpson said he and Hadid were committed to making their relationship last, and Hadid even made an appearance in the music video for Simpson's song \"Surfboard\" in 2014.\n\n''We definitely make it work,\" he said. \"We see each other a lot more than you would expect because we're sort of dedicated to making it work, and it's not too stressful.\"\n\nThe couple called it quits in 2015 after coming to a \"mutual decision,\" Simpson told Dujour.\n\n\u201cI love my ex-girlfriend, I always will,\" he said. \"We still talk every now and then, but the highly publicized thing made me uncomfortable.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing out to dinner and there being all this paparazzi and stuff,\" he added, \"as soon as we split I had the realization that I was straying away from who I was as a whole person. I want to keep it low-key, and focus on my music.\u201d\n\nHe once caught Bella Thorne off guard\n\nBack in her Disney Channel \"Shake It Up\" days, Bella Thorne gushed to Popstar! in 2011 about the time she met Simpson.\n\nThorne recalled how she looked \"grungy\" in a Yankees cap and sweats when she met the pop star.\n\n\"I really didn't know so much about him,\" she said. \"Zendaya was like, 'Bella, that is Cody Simpson.' And I was like, 'Who's that?' And she was like, 'Oh my gosh, it's Cody Simpson.' And I was like, 'OK.' She was like, 'Let's go say hi to him,' and I was like, 'Uh, honey boo, I have no makeup on, hair's up, I don't think so.' \"\n\nDespite her casual look, Thorne said she and Simpson exchanged contact information and saw each other again.\n\n\"He asked me for my number, and then he invited me to his birthday,\" she said.\n\nHe competed on 'Dancing With the Stars'\n\nIn 2014, Simpson competed on \"Dancing With the Stars\" and was partnered with pro dancer Witney Carson. They were eliminated in Week 5 during Disney night after dancing a samba to \"I Just Can't Wait to be King\" from \"The Lion King.\"\n\n\"This has been an amazing experience. Obviously it's tough, but it is what it is,\" said the clearly disappointed pop star once their elimination was revealed.\n\n\"I'm sad,\" Carson added. \"I feel like people didn't really get a chance to see Cody yet.\"\n\nHe proclaimed himself 'the male Taylor Swift'\n\nWhen it comes to his music, Simpson compared himself to another successful music mogul.\n\n\"I'm like the male Taylor Swift,\" he told Fuse. \"I write about everything that happens in my life, whether or not the songs actually are released or not.\"\n\nDoes this mean fans can expect a song about Cyrus? The one thing Simpson guaranteed is music is where he expresses his feelings.\n\n\"Music is just where I sort of write my emotions down,\" he added. \"It's just like I'm putting them out there.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/07/miley-cyrus-new-flame-what-we-know-aussie-cody-simpson/3901865002/", "description": "Miley Cyrus kissed him.
