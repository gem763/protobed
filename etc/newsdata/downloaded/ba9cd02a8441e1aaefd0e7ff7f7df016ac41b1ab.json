Halep still has a chance of qualifying having overcome US Open champion Bianca Andreescu in a three-set thriller in her opener.\n\nSvitolina had the better of long baseline rallies against an uncharacteristically errant Halep, who finished with 38 unforced errors.\n\n\u201cIt was an extremely physical match,\u201d Svitolina said after the match. \u201cI played very solid. I\u2019m very happy about that.\u201d\n\nAfter a slow start, Halep came back into the contest and a powerful forehand winner down the line clinched her break in the fifth game before the players held serve.\n\nLike how she started, a sloppy Halep misfired in the 12th game as she handed Svitolina the first set with a slew of unforced errors.\n\nHalep started well in the second set with an early break before falling away against a more consistent Svitolina.\n\nThe result broke a deadlock between the pair with Svitolina now holding a 5-4 edge and exacting revenge for a semi-loss to Halep at Wimbledon in July.\n\nThe 25-year-old is hoping to end a barren season on a high having not captured a title since last year\u2019s WTA Finals triumph.\n\nIn the later Purple Group match, Pliskova plays Andreescu with both players desperate to notch their first victory of the round-robin tournament.", "description": "Shenzhen (China) (AFP) \u2013 Defending champion Elina Svitolina stormed into the penultimate stage of the season-ending WTA Finals Wednesday after a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/79a0f8_elina-svitolina-on-her-way-beating-simona-halep-wta-finals-tennis-tournament-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
