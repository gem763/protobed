Both from Ethopia, Ababel Yeshaneh finished second with a time of 2:20:51 and Gelete Burka came in third at 2:20:55.\n\nThe previous world record time of 2:15:25 was set by Britain's Paula Radcliffe in 2003 at the London Marathon.\n\nAfter Kosgei broke Radcliffe's record, the two of them posed for a photo together.\n\nRadcliffe says it marked a bittersweet moment for her, according to The Guardian.\n\n\"If you had told me when I set it in 2003, that it would last that long I wouldn't have believed it,\" Radcliffe said. \"But I always knew this time would come \u2014 and when I saw how fast Brigid was running today I knew the record would go if she could maintain her pace.\"\n\nKosgei's world record race came just a day after fellow Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge broke the 2-hour marathon barrier with a time of 1 hour 59 minutes 40 seconds in Vienna, Austria, during an assisted event.\n\nBecause of the nature of the event, Kipchoge's time does not count as an official world record, but was celebrated nonetheless. Both Kosgei and Kipchoge were sporting Nike's new model of the Next% training shoes.\n\nKipchoge's victory was on Kosgei's mind, she said, as she set out on the Chicago course.\n\n\"I kept saying, 'Tomorrow is my day,'\" Kosgei told The New York Times. \"I wanted to be the second Kipchoge \u2014 the Kipchoge for women. I focused on that.\"", "description": "The 25-year-old runner finished in a time of 2:14:04 on Sunday, beating the previous record set by Britain's Paula Radcliffe in 2003 by 81 seconds.", "authors": ["Wynne Davis"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/13/gettyimages-1180820658_wide-3928de3c883db68edf67874af22c6f9eb8c74f97.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
