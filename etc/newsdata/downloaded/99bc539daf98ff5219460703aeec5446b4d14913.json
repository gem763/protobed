'This makes it very cheap, but also very risky.'\n\nThere have been numerous landings on the moon as a result of the 20th century space race between the US and the USSR - including the famed Apollo 11 mission which saw Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin become the first humans on the moon\n\nEngineers from the SpaceL team that launched Beresheet now have another chance to succeed with a smooth landing on the moon.\n\nThe team, who have remained largely the same since the disastrous mission in April, previously claimed they would move away from the moon as a landing destination but will now use their valuable experience for a second shot.\n\nSpeaking about the first mission Mr Hayun said: 'On the technical level, things were very difficult because we had a huge task defined: the first low-cost lunar mission. We had no reference to look at. It's never been done before.'", "description": "Israel's government-owned space company said it would try again after its first lander, Beresheet (pictured) crashed into the surface of the moon six months ago when its computers failed.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/17/11870408-0-The_SpaceIL_lunar_module_Beresheet_pictured_in_a_special_clean_r-a-22_1571933313815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
