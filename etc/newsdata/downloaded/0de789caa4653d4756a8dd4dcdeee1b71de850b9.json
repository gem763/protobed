However, we did locate literature on how to develop explosives and other weapons,\u201d College Place Officer Dylan Schmick told HuffPost.\n\nThe teen was arrested on charges of felony harassment and threats to bomb or injure property and was booked into the Walla Walla Juvenile Justice Center.\n\nThe city\u2019s police chief commended the boy\u2019s mother for her courage.\n\n\u201cThe mother was very emotional and loves her son. This was not an easy thing to do, but it was the right thing to do,\u201d College Place Police Chief Troy Tomaras said in a statement. \u201cThe mother wanted to prevent others from being hurt, and wants her son to get the help he needs.\u201d\n\nThe mother was very emotional and loves her son. This was not an easy thing to do, but it was the right thing to do. College Place Police Chief Troy Tomaras\n\nThe school district, in its own statement, encouraged students, staff and all residents to remain \u201caware of their surroundings and to report any suspicious activity to the authorities.\u201d\n\nIn the city of Richland, roughly an hour\u2019s drive northwest of College Place, another student was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly threatening their high school in a text message, a local TV station reported. Richland High School was reportedly placed in lockdown until the student could be located and removed from the school. This incident was unrelated to the College Place threat, police told HuffPost.\n\nA recent study of violent incidents in K-12 schools across the country found that more than 3,434 threats and incidents of violence had taken place during the 2018-2019 school year.\n\nIncidents that required outside response were found to have increased by 34% from the 2017-2018 school year. The number of reported threats, however, had declined by 9.5% compared to the previous year, according to the Violence in Schools report from the Educator\u2019s School Safety Network.\n\n\u201cA heightened awareness and adoption of a \u2018see something, say something\u2019 perspective by school stakeholders is a positive trend that may account for at least some of the increased number of reported threats,\u201d the non-profit school safety organization said. \u201cThis does not change the reality, however, that threats of violence continue to be a significant concern impacting schools.\u201d\n\nWhile the 3,058 reported threats in the 2018-2019 school year were less than the year before, they still totaled a nearly 50% increase compared to the 2016-2017 school year, the analysis found.\n\nWashington state recently passed several firearms-related bills, including one that prohibits domestic abusers and those with mental health issues and a history of violence from obtaining guns.\n\nThe state also raised the legal age to purchase a semiautomatic rifle to 21 and implemented a safe storage provision that makes a gun owner criminally responsible if their weapon is obtained by someone prohibited from possessing a firearm, such as a child or a felon. Exceptions are if the firearm was kept in a lockbox or safe yet still somehow accessed by a prohibited person or if it was reported stolen within a timely manner, the Seattle Times reported.\n\nSome local law enforcement agencies have said they will not enforce the new laws, arguing that they violate Second Amendment rights.", "description": "Authorities are commending the mother for calling police after finding his plans to target his school on the anniversary of the Columbine shooting.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d83a0a2230000580557d5c4.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
