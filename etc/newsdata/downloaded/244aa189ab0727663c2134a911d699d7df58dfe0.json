Some outlets reported that the two appeared annoyed at the reaction, but that isn\u2019t so clear on the replay.\n\nThere was awkward audience laughter when Kim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner said their family tells their stories \"unfiltered and unscripted.\" Yikes. #Emmys2019 pic.twitter.com/H6XH3g6L1L \u2014 Ryan Schocket (@RyanSchocket) September 23, 2019\n\nThere is also a chance that Kim K and Kendall were in on the joke \u2015 or were at least self-aware enough to see the humor in their remarks.\n\nComedian Kathy Griffin, who said she used to live next door to Kardashian and husband Kanye West, told \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d (in the segment above) that the Emmys audience did indeed laugh. Don\u2019t shed any tears for Kim K and crew, though. \u201cThey get laughed at and go home and count their money,\u201d the comic said.\n\nCheck out the Twitter reactions here:\n\nWait did the audience just laugh at the Kardashians?! #Emmys pic.twitter.com/AF8GPBbZ9M \u2014 Elizabeth Holme\u2019s Real Voice (@TheTerriDiaries) September 23, 2019\n\nDid they just laugh at Kim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner?
