On Monday, CEOs of the world\u2019s largest oil companies are expected to speak at an event organized by the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative where they\u2019ll likely defend the idea that gas is integral to a low-carbon future.\n\nHere are six key arguments about gas, starting with the case for the fuel:\n\n1. Gas is killing coal\n\nWhen burned cleanly, gas releases about half as much carbon as coal. Gas has been on a coal-killing advance across the U.S. power market for the last decade.\n\n2. Gas helps bring down emissions\n\nCleaner electricity generation means the U.S. economy can still grow and produce lower emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions have been on a flat-to-downward trend for the past decade.\n\n3. Gas will be affordable long-term\n\nThanks to fracking, which releases fossil fuels from hitherto impermeable shale rock, American gas is so abundant that producers can\u2019t find enough domestic demand and are rushing to export. That means local prices are cheap and look like they\u2019ll stay that way.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the case against gas:\n\n1. Gas means carbon is unavoidable\n\nWhile carbon dioxide emitted from gas-fired power is lower than coal (see above), locking in gas as a fuel means those emissions won\u2019t go to zero any time in the foreseeable future. Indeed, as the U.S. becomes increasingly addicted to gas, emissions from the fuel are rising in absolute terms, overtaking coal.\n\n2. Gas is being wasted\n\nExcess gas from oil wells is burned off in flaring, releasing carbon dioxide. The amount of gas being wasted has surged in the U.S. due to the fracking boom, as pipeline capacity can\u2019t keep pace.\n\n3. Gas leaks\n\nAnother problem is gas leaking from pipelines and processing plants into the atmosphere. Methane is 84 times more efficient at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. It\u2019s the \u201cAchilles heel\u201d of the gas industry, according to Susan Dio, chairman of BP Plc\u2019s U.S. division. There\u2019s been a substantial rise in global methane levels over the past 10 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A Cornell University study published in August traced the extra emissions to fracking in North America.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Kevin Crowley in Houston at kcrowley1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Championed by Big Oil as the fastest way to reduce emissions and reviled by environmentalists who say the world needs to ditch all fossil fuels -- the debate over natural gas may be one of the controversial aspects of climate change.The arguments will get an airing as politicians, activists", "authors": ["Kevin Crowley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x9GZBkHKkbGTfFYobRgu.g--~B/aD03NzQ7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/205b34282dc4331fd8362d14eb0f7589", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
