It was a particularly violent mass arrest even by Hong Kong standards, where four months of mass anti-government protest have become increasingly turbulent.\n\n\u201cI was there for the tear gas and then as everyone started leaving the raptors came in and I just saw black-clad people shoving people to the ground. In the middle of that someone grabbed me by the shoulder and I thought \u2018I\u2019m just going to keep moving. I\u2019m going to keep running,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

multicultural population, the movement has remained a largely Chinese and local affair with foreigners like Anna participating intermittently although their presence has been largely welcomed.\n\nMany foreign residents participated in the early days of the protest movement in June, as a legislative bill that would have allowed for residents to stand trial in mainland China set off a wave of political anger. On record weekends, 1 and 2 million people participated in mass marches, according to organiser figures, while foreign organisations like the American Chamber of Commerce spoke out against the bill.\n\nAs the weeks have dragged on and arrests have climbed to 2,000 at unsanctioned protests, visible foreigners have become harder to spot beyond the occasional curious onlooker or tourist.\n\nThis might get harder after Hong Kong\u2019s Carrie Lam imposed emergency legislation to ban face masks.\n\nTheir presence, however, is not without its complications. Chinese state media has accused the Hong Kong protests of being orchestrated by \u201cblack hands\u201d from the US and Western Europe, while online notable foreigners have been accused of working for the CIA.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

She wears all black including a cap and mask to disguise herself as she runs into the frontlines to extinguish police tear gas canisters and escorts protesters caught up in unexpected chaos away from the frontline.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure some people disagree with what I\u2019m doing, but as long as you can justify it to yourself when you actually thought about what you\u2019re doing and why, it\u2019s not for me to judge it\u2019s really up to that individual. Just try to do your best to not put other people at risk,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really up to each person how they want to contribute to the movement but I think if you live here and if you surround yourself with Hong Kong culture, Hong Kong people, do something, even if it\u2019s just telling your friends back home what\u2019s going on. Just do something.\u201d\n\nAnna said she had been welcomed by protesters, particularly when she used to be easier to identify out of her full protest gear.\n\n\u201cEarlier when I would just wear a mask, people would approach me and they would be grateful,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone be like, \u2018This isn\u2019t your place\u2019 because that is something I was worried about.\u201d\n\nBecca, another 20-something Australian citizen who has spent most of her life in Hong Kong and considers it home, also said she has personal reasons to attend to the protests due to her deep love for the city.\n\nWhile she does not run through police tear gas, she ferries supplies with her car and takes part in the protest movement\u2019s well-established graffiti campaigns, tagging walls and sidewalks.\n\n\u201cI had a big thick marker pen I was writing \u2018We\u2019re back\u2019 and \u2018ACAB,\u2019\u201d she says, an abbreviation for \u201cAll cops are b*****ds\u201d as she stood on a flyover outside Hong Kong offices a day earlier surrounded by thousands of protesters. Police water cannons were nearby and ready to fire, but like many protesters, Becca has worn long sleeves to protect her skin from the cannons\u2019 abrasive blue dye.\n\nAfter nearly four months, Becca said she remained motivated to keep going, even as other protesters have dropped out, in part due to a troubling childhood experience with Hong Kong police that saw her strip-searched her after she was accused of stealing from a 7-Eleven shop.\n\n\u201cI just feel like for me it\u2019s not even about how long I\u2019ve been here. This is just about how I feel passionately about the cause and I feel a sense of moral obligation to help. I don\u2019t know if that has anything to do with me being as much of a Hong Konger as I can be without being a local,\u201d she said.\n\nBecca said even locals might choose to stay away due to business ties to China or conversely, a lack of ties or experiences in the local community. \u201cMaybe if this was the only home that they have they would be forced to really think about what is happening,\u201d she said.\n\nSimilar to Anna, she said she is often thanked by protesters for attending the demonstrations. Neither of the women also seem concerned about being identified online for their work on the frontlines of protests. More visible activists, like the Briton \u201cHong Kong Hermit,\u201d have often been accused of being a foreign agent for live-streaming the protest movement.\n\nThe narrative of foreign intervention has been particularly important with Chinese state media which has accused the US and Western nations of trying to create a \u201ccolour\u201d revolution in Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 after 150 years of British rule.\n\nIt has escalated as well, as some protesters have begun to carry flags of the US, UK, Republic of China and the Hong Kong colonial flag in a bid to win international attention, particularly from the US Congress which is mulling the punitive Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.\n\nAccusations of being a CIA agent, however, have not seemed to unfazed \u201cHong Kong Hermit\u201d or another alleged \u201cCIA\u201d mole Sean Tierney, an American university lecturer often seen in the thick of protests over the course of the summer as well as during the city\u2019s 2014 democracy protests.\n\nTeirney\u2019s presence on the frontlines, however, has scaled back from activism to helping journalists these days as volunteer security.\n\n\u201cI found that it was best if I\u2019m there to observe things. If I observe something that someone needs to take a picture of but also making sure that while they are looking through their viewfinder I\u2019m the one telling them how far away the police are or I\u2019m saying \u2018All right, come on we have to move,\u2019\u201d Tierney said.\n\n\u201cI could say my presence at protests brings up all kinds of postcolonial weirdness and/or issues of espionage\u2026 therefore I shouldn\u2019t go but that would please the government,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job is to exercise my right as a resident and I am entitled to those rights under the Basic Law. I\u2019m not doing anything wrong and if I am I don\u2019t have any qualms about being arrested and being charged,\u201d he said.", "description": "Anna sits on the sidewalk after a particularly violent day of Hong Kong protests, recounting how she narrowly escaped arrest last Sunday after riot police surprised a large group of protesters occupying a major road of the government district.", "authors": ["Erin Hale"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/01/19/Hong-Kong.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
