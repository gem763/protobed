They were later removed and detained.\n\nIlya Fisher, a fine art photographer from Cornwall, said she was taking part despite never having been arrested before.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing this because I want other people to say, \u2018Why is such a boring ordinary person doing this?\u2019 and they will look into the climate science,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government isn\u2019t protecting us.
