More than five dozen other inspectors general also signed their letter to Engel, who heads the Justice Department\u2019s OLC.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint, lodged by an anonymous intelligence official in August, detailed President Donald Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and alleged efforts by White House officials to \u201clock down\u201d records of the conversation.\n\nMichael Atkinson, the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, deemed the complaint credible and \u201curgent,\u201d and forwarded the document to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who initially refused to provide it to Congress.\n\nMaguire acknowledged during testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in September that he first discussed the complaint with the White House counsel\u2019s office, and then consulted with the Justice Department\u2019s OLC \u2014 which concluded the complaint did not meet the legal definition of \u201curgent\u201d because Trump is not an employee of the intelligence community.\n\nBut Atkinson disagreed with the OLC opinion and informed the House Intelligence Committee of the complaint\u2019s existence. The \u201carguments and concerns\u201d he raised in his response to the OLC memorandum were \u201ccompelling,\u201d Horowitz and Lerner wrote.\n\n\u201cIn this matter, OLC did not find that production to Congress was limited due to a valid constitutional concern,\u201d they wrote. \u201cRather, OLC substituted its judgment and reversed a determination the statute specifically entrusted to the ICIG because of its independence, objectivity, and expertise to credibly assess the information.\u201d\n\nMaguire eventually turned the complaint over to Congress after significant pressure from lawmakers including a threat by House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to pursue legal action against the administration.\n\nHorowitz and Lerner also warned in their letter \u201cthat the OLC opinion creates uncertainty for federal employees and contractors across government about the scope of whistleblower protections, thereby chilling whistleblower disclosures.\u201d\n\nThey concluded: \u201cWe urge you to reconsider the conclusions of the OLC opinion and withdraw or modify it.\u201d\n\nThe president and his allies have dismissed the whistleblower as a partisan with no first-hand knowledge of the events in question.\n\n\u201cWhere is the Whistleblower, and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the Ukrainian President?,\u201d Trump tweeted Thursday. \u201cWhy did the IG allow this to happen? Who is the so-called Informant (Schiff?) who was so inaccurate? A giant Scam!\u201d\n\nLawyers for the whistleblower, Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid, have pushed back on the president's characterization of their client's complaint. In an opinion article published Friday, they argued, \u201cthe reality is that the identity of the whistleblower is irrelevant\u201d because his account has been largely corroborated.\n\nThe Justice Department responded on Friday in a letter, stating that it is the \"sole responsibility\" of the DOJ to interpret the statutes as Congress has written them, and they did \"precisely that\" in their opinion.\n\n\"We are confident that our opinion does not diminish the statutory protections that Congress has provided to federal employees and contractors who make good-faith disclosures to inspectors general,\" wrote Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/84/e1/659fd9594ac79c3035ef7af9558a/191025-michael-horowitz-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
