We don\u2019t cut and run.\u201d\n\nThe New York State tax department scored a major legal victory against Obus last month, after a judge ruled he must pay taxes as a \u201cstatutory resident\u201d of New York State because of his Northville, New York, home \u2013 even though he is domiciled in New Jersey.\n\nRegardless of the amount of time spent at the property, it was determined that the home is a \u201cpermanent place of abode.\u201d Since Obus works in New York City, he spends an aggregate of more than 183 days in the state per year.\n\nHe owes $526,868 in back-taxes, plus interest and penalties for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. He purchased the house \u2013 where he spends no more than three weeks per year \u2013 in 2011 for $290,000.\n\nObus, who is no stranger to the high-tax exodus occurring in the state, called New York\u2019s tax department \u201copportunistic\u201d and \u201cextremely aggressive,\u201d adding that it doesn\u2019t \u201creflect well\u201d on the state if it doesn\u2019t create a welcoming environment.\n\n\u201cI can burn the damn thing down and still be okay, but \u2026 they don\u2019t have the right to double tax me,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nGlenn Newman, a tax lawyer at Greenberg Traurig who worked with Obus on the case, previously told FOX Business they were going to appeal the decision.\n\nExperts have also told FOX Business that as New York State loses tax revenue from the flight of individuals to lower-tax havens \u2013 like Florida \u2013 auditors are likely only going to get more aggressive, specifically where wealthy residents are concerned.\n\nAs previously reported by FOX Business, most individuals lose their audit cases against the state of New York.
