This means the tortoise would have already been 100 when she was found, for her to have reached the grand old age of 344.\n\nAnd reptile experts have cast doubt on Alagba's alleged age.\n\nTim Skelton, curator of reptiles at Bristol Zoo, said it would be \"impossible\" for Alagba to have lived that long.\n\n'Unlikely in the extreme'\n\n\"A hundred years is a very good age,\" said Mr Skelton. \"Giant tortoises can live up to 200, but that's a very rare exception.\"\n\nAlagba is not a giant tortoise. After looking at photos, Mr Skelton categorised Alagba as an African spur-thighed tortoise.\n\nJohn Wilkinson, a professional herpetologist - an expert in reptiles - agreed.\n\n\"I would have thought that it would be unlikely in the extreme,\" he said. \"They just don't live that long.\"\n\nImage copyright GIANLUIGI GUERCIA Image caption Jonathan is believed to be the oldest animal on earth\n\nThe oldest tortoise - indeed animal - in the world is believed to be Jonathan, an 187-year-old giant tortoise who lives in St Helena.\n\n\"Any other tortoise lives between 70-80 years old, maximum 100,\" Mr Skelton said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Is this the oldest tortoise in the world?\n\nSo where did Alagba come from?\n\nThe story goes that she was brought to the palace by Isan Okumoyede, when he returned from a successful expedition over 200 years ago.\n\nIf this is true, Alagba will have lived through the reign of 18 Ogbomoso kings.\n\nImage copyright Peace Sojay and his family Image caption People used to pray with the tortoise\n\nMr Wilkinson has a simple explanation: \"I don't think there's much of a mystery here to be honest - there has been more than one tortoise.\"\n\n\"They loved it so much they went and bought another one.\"\n\nAnd it seems as though this is not the end of Alagba's story. The current king said he plans to preserve her remains for tourism and historical records.", "description": "Reptile experts says it is \"impossible\" for a tortoise to reach such an age.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4BAA/production/_109107391_tortoise4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
