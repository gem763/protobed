We have been really moved and touched by what we have seen, and by the happy home you have made. 'I'm aware that many of you have experienced extremely difficult times in your lives. But it is inspiring to see how you have used your strength and positivity to help transform the lives of so many young children here.' 'Being here in Pakistan this week, William and I have seen on several occasions how family is at the heart of your culture. 'Parents, children, aunts, uncles, grandparents all play important roles \u2013 you have reminded us exactly what family means. You have shown us too that it is not simply a term that describes the relationship between blood relatives 'Instead it describes those special bonds we share with those who make us feel safe and supported. It is the quality of those relationships that matters. 'Earlier this year I talked about the fact that it takes a village to raise a child. The village we have seen here today is the best representation of that ideal that I could have possibly imagined. 'Together as a village you are transforming children's lives and providing them with strong foundations to support all their families. 'You have created a home, where children are given the love, protection, and support that will enable them to have a fairer chance in life. 'Here, women who were once vulnerable, now play the most vital of roles as mothers and it is most heartening to see that you are not doing this alone.'\n\nThey will later make a trip to the same cancer hospital visited by Diana in the year before her death. Earlier, the royals were given a red carpet welcome at Lahore Airport as they met the city's governor.\n\nThe SOS Children's Village provides a home and family structure to over 150 orphaned children from babies to age 18, and promotes the development of them into happy, confident and resilient adults.\n\nBuilt over ten acres, it started out with 15 family homes, to which another four have since been added.

I am called William. How old you you?\n\nAfter asking each of the children's ages, he asked one little boy: 'How old do you think I am? '\n\n'Twenty one,' offered the child.

The same forces repeatedly attacked it until 1398 when it fell under the control of the Turkic conqueror Timur. But in 1524 it was captured by the Mughal B\u0101bur's troops, which began its golden age under the Mughal dynasty when it became a royal residence. By the 18th century it was an Iranian empire outpost, before being associated with the rise of the Sikhs. But following the death of ruler Ranjit Singh in 1839, it passed under British rule in 1849 and did not receive independence until 1947. Its historic landmarks include the 36-acre Lahore Fort, the huge mosque at Badshahi and the Shalimar Garden. Today more than six million people live in the financial hub, where major industries include textiles and rubber.\n\nIn her first speech of the tour the duchess said: 'We've had such an amazing time walking around the village and learning all about your lives.\n\n'We have been really moved and touched by what we have seen, and by the happy home you have made.\n\n'I'm aware that many of you have experienced extremely difficult times in your lives.
