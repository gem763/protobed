We plan on bringing you the latest information about events in the NFL for all 32 teams. The season will start very soon, and that means there is plenty of news surrounding all the teams after their preseason games. Who will make the playoffs? Who will be the basement dwellers? And which teams will narrowly miss out on the chance to play in the playoffs this season? Only time will tell, but this page will keep you updated.\n\nThe favorites for this year's Super Bowl are the New England Patriots, who have possibly the greatest quarterback of all time in Tom Brady. New England also has one of the best head coaches of all time in Bill Belichick. who has had unmatched success throughout the NFL since 2000. Those two factors, plus the addition of Brandin Cooks and other key free agents like Mike Gillislee, have made the Patriots overwhelming favorites to win the AFC and the Superbowl.\n\nThe most likely challengers in the AFC will be the Oakland Raiders, who are listed as 6 to 1 to win the Super Bowl in Las Vegas sportsbooks. With Derek Carr, the Raiders were an excellent team last year and they only improved on offense with the addition of Marshawn Lynch. The Steelers, with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, star running back Le'Veon Bell, and wide receivers Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant have an offense that is high powered enough to challenge the New England Patriots for dominance in the AFC.\n\nIn the NFC, the Dallas Cowboys, Green Bay Packers, Atlanta Falcons, and Seattle Seahawks are the favorites. The Cowboys had one of the best records in the NFL last season and were led by rookies Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliot. The NFL has suspended Elliot for the first six games of the season, so they''ll have to operate without him for now.\n\nThe Falcons made it to the Super Bowl in their last NFL season, but fell short after blowing a big lead to New England late in the game. This season, they return all their offensive weapons except coordinator Kyle Shanahan, who left to become head coach of the 49ers. It will be interesting to see if quarterback Matt Ryan will have the same success this year without his playcalling.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are perennial contenders at this point, and Russell Wilson always gives the team a chance to win every game they play in. The Seahawks' elite defense makes them a solid candidate to not only make the playoffs but make a deep run as well. The Green Bay Packers are another team that always have a chance in every game, but it's certainly not courtesy of their defense. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers is widely regarded as one of the best players in the NFL, and he leads one of the best offenses in the league every season. Don't sleep on the Packers this year.\n\nThat was just a recap of the favorites! Expect the unexpected this season, as there will surely be a few teams that rise up to challenge some of these other ones for playoff spots and maybe even for the Super Bowl.", "description": "The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football", "authors": ["Blasting News", "Zeegee Cecilio", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Samantha Spencer", "Ken Kluska", "Vincent Toussaint", "Andrew Granville", "Lawrence Lease", "Matt Emery"], "top_image": "https://static.blastingnews.com/media/social/og-1200x630.png", "published_at": "2019-04-10"}
