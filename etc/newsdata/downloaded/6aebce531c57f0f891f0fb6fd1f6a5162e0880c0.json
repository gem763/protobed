In fact, it\u2019s highly encouraged by the parks, and you can even purchase a Disney makeover for your kids in the park complete with authentic costumes, hairstyles, and makeup by the pros. But as the kids get older, they are less likely to be dressed up, and once they hit the age of 14, you won\u2019t spot a single one of them in costume.\n\nIt isn\u2019t because they\u2019re \u201ctoo cool for school\u201d; it\u2019s actually completely against the rules. According to the official Disney Park rule-book, any guest aged 14 or older may be refused admittance to the park if they are wearing costumes or masks. Admittedly, there are exceptions for certain occasions such as Mickey\u2019s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party, or other after-hours events, but invitations and instructions for those events will give specific dispensation of the rule. And the employees have to obey a dress code, too.\n\nHow do they define \u201ccostume\u201d? That\u2019s a bit harder to pin down. Masks are only appropriate if they are necessary medically for your stay at the park, but wigs, tutus, and, of course, the iconic mouse ears are fully acceptable under the Disney-approved dress code.\n\nThe purpose of this rule is two-fold. One, your face can\u2019t be covered, and you can\u2019t be carrying anything resembling a real weapon. This is obviously a safety issue and this rule still applies during the \u201cexception events\u201d\u2014 even your villainous props must not resemble a real weapon, so choose your cosplay wisely.\n\nThe second reason realistic costumes are banned during normal park hours is to ensure that any interactions park guests have with cast members remain genuine and on brand. If there were 20 adults running around dressed like Cinderella, some of the guests in costume may get one confused with Disney\u2019s official princess, ruining the illusion for children and allowing someone appearing to be an official Disney employee to go off brand with messaging, experience, or by breaking one of the 15 Disney etiquette rules all Disney employees must follow.\n\nSo does that mean that you can\u2019t truly get into the spirit of your favorite Disney character the next time you head to one of the parks? Not exactly! Devoted Disney fan Leslie Kay began a trend that many of her fellow Disney lovers began to pick up on as they entered the parks: DisneyBounding.\n\nDisneyBounding is a way for adults to experience the magic of the parks \u201cin costume\u201d without breaking the official Disney rules. In essence, DisneyBounding is dressing up in a non-costume outfit inspired by your favorite character. The interpretation could include the color scheme, Disney-merchandised accessories, and/or unique traits of the characters\u2019 more famous looks.\n\nSo maybe you can\u2019t dress up in Princess Belle\u2019s iconic yellow dress, but you could wear a yellow dress with rose or teacup-themed jewelry. Try to be creative with your look the next time you head to one of the parks, but be sure to abide by these 11 etiquette rules all guests have to follow while you\u2019re there!\n\nThis story was originally published by Reader's Digest.", "description": "It's very possible this little-known rule could get you kicked out of a Disney park \u2014 or even banned!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/04/25/694940094001_6030007504001_6030001551001-vs.jpg"}
