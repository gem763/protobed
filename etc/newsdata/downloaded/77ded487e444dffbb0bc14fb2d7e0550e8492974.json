So that\u2019s a good sign that he\u2019s preparing well.\u201d\n\nA bashful Goodhue replied: \u201cI\u2019ve had a bit of a hard time for that. I can\u2019t win in this team.\u201d\n\nIn a relaxed news conference spanning selection and preparation \u2014 as well as haircuts \u2014 Goodhue insisted that cleaning up his act would not extend to chopping off his mullet, one of several outlandish cuts at the Rugby World Cup.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting rid of the mullet. You can ask this every week. It\u2019s not going,\u201d said the 24-year-old centre.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s actually scientific evidence that shows it makes me faster. It was done at Harvard, I think,\u201d he joked.\n\nFoster admitted that team haircuts were becoming \u201cthe highlight of the week\u201d, with six or seven stylists lining the players up in the team room to make the All Blacks look sharp.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually quite a show. There\u2019s been some miss-cuts I guess,\u201d said Foster, revealing that fullback George Bridge had not been happy with his effort.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s hoping for some very sunny days to get rid of the white line round the back of the neck. Don\u2019t look at it tomorrow because you\u2019ll embarrass him,\u201d said the coach.\n\nOn a more serious note, Goodhue said the match-up against Ireland was to be \u201cthe biggest\u201d in his fledgling career.\n\nAnd lock Sam Whitelock said \u201cthese games are why we play rugby\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese games are the ones that when you\u2019re a little kid at home in the back yard you dream about and you always want to take the winning drop goal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think that will be me. Fossie (Foster) won\u2019t be happy if I try to take a drop,\u201d quipped the hulking second row forward, not known for his kicking skills.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 New Zealand centre Jack Goodhue has shaved off his moustache for the \u201cbiggest game\u201d of his life this weekend but insists", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/08f4c6_jack-goodhue-has-sharpening-up-quarter-final-weekend-hair-news-moustache-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
