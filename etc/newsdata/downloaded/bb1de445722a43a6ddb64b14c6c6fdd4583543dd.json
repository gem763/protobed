(Aaron Tarin) (Aaron Tarin /Aaron Tarin)\n\nLife as an immigrant can be complicated, which is part of the reason why Cecilia Figueroa-Figueroa spent about six years volunteering to help those new to the United States with education and legal matters. But all of the Utah woman\u2019s knowledge couldn\u2019t prevent immigration enforcement officials from coming after her.\n\nFigueroa-Figueroa, 55, is currently \u201cat large\" for failure to self-deport to her home country, Mexico, as she said she would as part of a recent agreement she made with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for two 2008 border arrests for illegally entering the country, said Alethea Smock, an ICE public affairs officer. Deportation is looming because Figueroa-Figueroa had been federally convicted of illegally entering the country, Smock said.\n\nNow she might be forced to return to her hometown of Guerrero, a place the State Department has designated as a \u201cdo not travel\u201d area because of crime. There were 977 murders there within the first five months of this year, according to data collected by the National Public Security System in Mexico.\n\nFigueroa-Figueroa has been a longtime community activist, volunteering her time for those six years through a local nonprofit group where she would organize educational campaigns for immigrants, assist in the organization\u2019s pro bono legal clinic and coordinate volunteer activities for the various campaigns the nonprofit group would produce, her attorney, Aaron Tarin, said.\n\nAll that training, time and education Figueroa-Figueroa had still wasn\u2019t enough for her to understand how convoluted her own case was.\n\n\u201cWhat occurred to her at the border is something that is complicated enough that it\u2019s beyond her understanding,\u201d Tarin said. \u201cThis was something that an attorney would need to review and understand.\u201d\n\nAbout 100 to 150 members of the Latino community and clergy gathered in support, holding a rally Friday in front of an ICE office in Utah, said the Rev. Monica Dobbins, who attended the gathering.\n\nTarin\u2019s office recently took over Figueroa-Figueroa\u2019s case, saying her status with ICE is much more nuanced than it appears and that her situation is also representative of increasing challenges in immigration laws under the Trump administration.\n\nOn the path\n\nSince last year, Figueroa-Figueroa had been on a path to legitimizing her immigration status and right to work.\n\nAfter years of volunteering her time and working odd jobs, she received her work permit Oct. 18 and moved from volunteer to employee at Comunidades Unidas, a large nonprofit group in Utah run by and serving Latinos. She even received a Social Security number, said Tarin, who sits on the Comunidades Unidas board of the directors.\n\nTarin thinks a previous attorney\u2019s advice cost Figueroa-Figueroa $7,000 and left her at risk of being removed from a community in which she has lived and served. His firm took over her case when she was picked up by ICE.\n\nFigueroa-Figueroa was trying to receive a benefit under a provision of the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act through her husband, whom she married in March 2018. Under the provision, her illegal-entry status would be waived and she would have paid a $1,000 penalty for the way she entered the country.\n\nIn November 1995, Figueroa-Figueroa\u2019s father-in-law, a legal permanent resident, applied for an I-130 form for his son. Approval would have meant that any future spouse would receive the waiver under the LIFE Act provision Figueroa-Figueroa was seeking, Tarin said.\n\nBut there was another snag.\n\nThe application had been in a pending status since 1995, meaning that Figueroa-Figueroa\u2019s husband had been technically undocumented for 24 years, said Tarin, who suspects that Figueroa-Figueroa\u2019s husband will receive his green card soon.\n\n\u201cIt's a bittersweet result for her husband,\u201d Tarin said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to figure out how he's going to continue his life here or if he's going to go back with her.\u201d\n\nFigueroa-Figueroa thought she was having the final meeting for her green-card application on Aug. 27, but her immigration benefits were denied.\n\nThat same day, she was briefly detained by ICE deportation officers and released on \u201chumanitarian grounds,\u201d according to a statement by Smock.\n\nFigueroa-Figueroa told ICE deportation officers that she would return to Mexico on Labor Day. She did not.\n\n\u2018Credible fear\u2019\n\nTarin said ICE was aware Figueroa-Figueroa wasn\u2019t going to leave the country by Labor Day because she was in the process of setting up a credible fear interview, which is an asylum-related form of relief that will temporarily hold off her deportation order as officials determine if her case has merit.\n\nThe process can take between several weeks and several months, depending on how fast U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services acts.\n\nICE could detain Figueroa-Figueroa during this process, but the agency is allowing her to remain at home while under ICE supervision.\n\nIf Figueroa-Figueroa\u2019s credible-fear case is denied, she could be sent back to Mexico.\n\nFigueroa-Figueroa says one of her nephews was kidnapped, murdered and dismembered three years ago. She also says two nephews were kidnapped but lived.\n\nBecause Figueroa-Figueroa has lived in the United States, she could be in danger of being kidnapped or extorted by criminal operations in the area, Tarin said.\n\n[As Trump tightens the U.S. border, asylum applicants seek refuge in Mexico, elsewhere]\n\nClaribel Tejada, a Utah-based attorney, said she hasn\u2019t known any person to get asylum since President Trump took office.\n\nThe deportation order on Figueroa-Figueroa \u201cwas bad to begin with.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe should\u2019ve just gone back to her country and then find a legal way to come back,\u201d she said, acknowledging the obstacles in immigration laws. \u201cYou have so many rules.\u201d\n\nA cautionary tale\n\nThe likelihood that Figueroa-Figueroa\u2019s case will be denied is relatively high and serves as a warning to those who have been stopped at the border before.\n\nDorany Rodriguez-Baltazar has been practicing immigration law for 25 years in Utah. She has worked with Comunidades Unidas, partnering with it for news segments about what to do in emergencies and what to do if detained by ICE.\n\nRodriguez-Baltazar said that sometimes people don\u2019t know whether they received a voluntary return to their country or a removal order at the border. A voluntary departure allows a person to return to their home country at their own expense in a certain amount of time so they can avoid a final order of removal, according to LGBTQ immigrant rights organization Immigration Equality.\n\n\u201cYou can file a [Freedom of Information Act request], and you can get those records,\" she said, noting that her practice is to always file a FOIA request at the border before she files any other document. That step, she said, confirms whether someone has a removal order as Figueroa-Figueroa did.\n\nTarin said he automatically files FOIAs, queries multiple agencies and sends fingerprints to the FBI or U.S. Customs and Border Protection to cross-reference his clients who have been stopped at the border before.\n\nHe said a case like Figueroa-Figueroa\u2019s would have likely been considered a low priority under the previous administration but that things have changed.\n\n\u201cIf they are denied, they will be placed in deportation proceedings,\u201d he said. \u201cThis administration\u2019s goal is to send a stern warning.\u201d\n\nTarin will pursue certain appeal avenues if Figueroa-Figueroa\u2019s request is denied.\n\nShe\u2019s in unusually high spirits,\u201d Tarin said. \u201cShe wants her story and her situation to benefit as many other people as possible.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nNew rule gives Trump administration more discretion to change asylum law\n\nChief of U.S. asylum office reassigned as White House pushes for tighter immigration controls\n\nJudge rejects Good Samaritan defense in immigration case\n\nMexico declares success in slowing migrant flow", "description": "Utah immigrant advocate Cecilia Figueroa-Figueroa is facing deportation because she had been arrested crossing the border in 2008.", "authors": ["Lateshia Beachum", "September At Pm", "Lateshia Beachum Is A General Assignment Reporter For The Washington Post.
