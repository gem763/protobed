(Aaron Josefczyk/Reuters)\n\nShortly after the Cars released its third album in 1980, singer, songwriter and guitarist Ric Ocasek played a cassette in his at-home recording studio in north Boston for a Rolling Stone writer, showing off the rough-cut demos of the songs from \u201cPanorama.\u201d The album had received mixed reviews from critics, but fans loved it, filling concert venues across America.\n\nListening to the stripped down versions of the songs, though, the writer told the frontman his solo performances were \u201cfar stranger and more obsessed-sounding\u201d than the tracks on the album. A bandmate described the recordings as \u201cinside-out music.\u201d The reporter told Ocasek he liked these odd early recordings better than the final ones.\n\n\u201cI have to admit,\u201d Ocasek responded with a smile, \u201cin my heart of hearts, that sometimes I do, too. But the band can\u2019t always play this stuff the way I envision it.\u201d\n\nThe experimental vision of the lanky, black-haired artist turned the Cars into an international phenomenon by straddling the line between his avant-garde interests and melodic, radio-friendly rock. His songs sometimes confounded critics, who were unsure where to place the Cars in an emerging constellation of New Wave bands, but crowds flocked to the band, which landed in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nOcasek died in his Manhattan apartment on Sunday afternoon at age 75, New York City police told the Associated Press. Officials said they do not suspect foul play and are awaiting a medical examiner\u2019s report. He is survived by six sons from three marriages, Entertainment Weekly reported, including two from his third wife, model Paulina Porizkova, who separated from him last year.\n\nBorn Richard Otcasek in Baltimore, he got his first guitar as a gift from his grandmother. But Ocasek\u2019s musical career really began in Cleveland, where he graduated from high school in 1963. He sneaked into a folk club there and played acoustic guitar in front of an audience for the first time as a teenager, he told Rolling Stone in 2017. He met bassist Benjamin Orr in Cleveland while Orr was often playing for a local TV program with a band called the Grasshoppers. That\u2019s also where Ocasek said he smoked his first joint.\n\nOcasek and Orr joined forces and traveled the country before settling in Boston and starting the Cars, a five-man group that played local bars and recorded its first demo album in 1977. Boston radio stations played the band\u2019s demos for \u201cJust What I Needed\u201d and \u201cMy Best Friend\u2019s Girl\u201d so often that Elektra Records signed the group in 1978 and produced its debut album, \u201cThe Cars,\u201d which was a near-instant hit. Three songs from the album\u2060 \u2014 \u201cJust What I Needed,\u201d \u201cMy Best Friend\u2019s Girl,\u201d and \u201cGood Times Roll\u201d \u2060 \u2014 made the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In 1984, the band had another huge success with \u201cHeartbeat City,\u201d an album with five Top 40 singles.\n\nThe Cars\u2019 music video for the song \u201cDouble Life\u201d was one of the first 30 aired on VH1, and the band won the inaugural MTV Video of the Year award in 1984 for \u201cYou Might Think.\u201d\n\nViewed by many as standoffish and eccentric, Ocasek acknowledged that people could see him as \u201cforbidding or aloof.\u201d But those who worked with Ocasek described him as dedicated to his craft.\n\n\u201cRic was very, very sober and very down to earth, which is rare,\u201d Roy Thomas Baker, who produced several albums for the Cars, told Rolling Stone in 1979.\n\nOcasek wrote seven albums with the Cars, and also released seven solo albums. After the Cars broke up in 1988, Ocasek began producing music for other bands, including Bad Religion, No Doubt and Weezer. A towering figure, Ocasek was known for dressing in black and wearing his signature sunglasses. He described himself as an \u201coutcast\u201d for much of his early life, but he said music was a way to connect with people.\n\n\u201cTo me, music\u2019s a powerful emotional force,\u201d he told Rolling Stone in 1980. \u201cIt can make people cry, feel happy or feel sexual. But more important than all of that, it\u2019s a way to communicate without alienating people, a way to get beyond loneliness. It\u2019s a private thing people can have for themselves any time they want. Just turn on a radio and there it is: a sense of belonging. Without having to surrender to anybody else\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nAs news of Ocasek\u2019s death spread on Sunday evening, rock bands shared tributes to the late artist. Weezer posted photos of Ocasek in the studio, calling him \u201cour friend and mentor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will miss him forever, & will forever cherish the precious times we got to work and hang out with him,\u201d Weezer posted on Twitter. \u201cRest in Peace & rock on Ric, we love you.\"\n\nThe weezer family is devastated by the loss of our friend and mentor Ric Ocasek, who passed away Sunday. We will miss him forever, & will forever cherish the precious times we got to work and hang out with him. Rest in Peace & rock on Ric, we love you. #RIPRicOcasek #karlscorner pic.twitter.com/JcTXevr6V8 \u2014 weezer (@Weezer) September 16, 2019\n\nAt a show in Boston on Sunday, Brooklyn-based rock band the Hold Steady walked onstage playing the Cars\u2019 \u201cSince You\u2019re Gone.\u201d\n\nOur walkout: \u201cSince You\u2019re Gone\u201d.\n\n\n\nRIP Ric Ocasek pic.twitter.com/si1DI7HtOT \u2014 The Hold Steady (@theholdsteady) September 16, 2019\n\nOcasek\u2019s career brought him back to Cleveland in 2018, where the Cars performed \u201cMy Best Friend\u2019s Girl\u201d during the ceremony to induct the band into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cI kind of started playing here and I could stop playing here, in Cleveland,\u201d Ocasek told Rolling Stone the day he found out the Cars would be joining the Hall of Fame. \u201cThis could be the bookends.
