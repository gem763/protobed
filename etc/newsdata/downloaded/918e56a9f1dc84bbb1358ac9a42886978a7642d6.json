While at NASA\u2019s Space Operations Center in Washington DC, Pitt chatted with astronaut Nick Hague who has been living on the ISS since March.\n\nISS astronauts are fairly accustomed to doing interviews with journalists and schoolchildren while in space, but it\u2019s a rare occasion when a movie actor is the voice on the line. Pitt started his line of questioning firmly in the entertainment sphere, asking Hague how realistic his new movie is when it comes to physics. (While the movie comes out on September 20th here on Earth, Hague and his fellow astronauts got to see it in advance.)\n\n\u201cHow did we do? How was our zero-g?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that I have you all the way up at the space station, let\u2019s talk about me,\u201d joked Pitt. \u201cHow did we do? How was our zero-g?\u201d Hague had only good things to say about the depiction, but he noted that he probably enjoyed real microgravity more than Pitt did. \u201cI got to imagine it was a lot easier for me to kind of enjoy the zero-g,\u201d said Hague, noting that while he was free-floating, Pitt would have had to be hooked to strings or acting against CGI.\n\nPitt asked Hague a lot of questions about what experiments he was working on, what spacewalking is like, and how the astronauts manage to have a normal sleeping schedule when they see 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets every day. The key: having the right color of light to wake them up in the morning and the right one to put them to sleep. The actor also wanted to know how one handles living in space for up to 200 days at a time.\n\n\u201cWhat is that like on the psyche?\u201d asked Pitt. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re always busy, but at the same time missing family and loved ones at home. How do you keep your mental state at peace?\u201d Hague\u2019s answer: \u201cOne of the luxuries I think we have of working in low Earth orbit close to the Earth is the amount of connectivity that we have.\u201d He pointed out that he can easily do video calls with his family and check in with them on a regular basis.\n\nOf course, the discussion eventually turned to much more serious matters, as Pitt wanted to know \u201cwho controls the jam box?\u201d Apparently, the astronauts have a rotating playlist that they all take turns contributing to. \u201cIt\u2019s nice because we have the international flair as well,\u201d said Hague. \u201cSo we have an Italian astronaut on board, along with the US astronauts and then two cosmonauts. And so getting to hear some traditional music from Russia over dinner is... a nice change exposure and helps us really appreciate that international feel that the crew has.\u201d\n\nThe entire interview took about 20 minutes; you can watch the full video above. Pitt expertly rounded out the discussion with one very important acting question. \u201cNick, last question, and I need to call on your expertise,\u201d said Pitt. \u201cWho was more believable: Clooney or Pitt?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were, absolutely,\u201d answered Hague.", "description": "Brad Pitt \u2014 who is set to play a gun-wielding, pirate-hunting astronaut in the upcoming film Ad Astra \u2014 got the chance to speak to someone who actually has the job of his on-screen character: an astronaut on board the International Space Station.
