Really. I believe in the players that we have, I believe in the players that are in Tottenham today.\n\n\u201cI respect all the opinions and for sure there are going to be people who say we need to change or we need to do something, in or out. If it is my decision I am going to stick with my players because I know they have the quality.\n\n\u201cIt is only to unlock some situation that is always going on in their minds.
