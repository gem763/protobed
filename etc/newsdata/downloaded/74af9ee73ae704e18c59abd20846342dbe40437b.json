Bernie Sanders is a democratic socialist. He\u2019s peddling the same tired 2016 talking points. 'Socialists of the world' unite is the war cry. And being that Sanders wants to pretty much destroy the country with his agenda, he found a nice ally in Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) who decided to endorse him over the weekend; AOC\u2019s Green New Deal is also a recipe for economic catastrophe. We\u2019ve long said that progressives and far-leftists hate the U.S. Constitution. It has mechanisms that prevent their agenda from being fully implemented. So, it shouldn\u2019t be shocking that when you analyze Sanders' economic agenda, not only are the ideas bad\u2014they could be illegal. InsideSources spoke with a couple of economics professors who admit that they\u2019re very much in-line with what Democrats have proposed in the past and even they said the Sanders plan is trash and unconstitutional (via InsideSources):\n\nThe notable points in his plan include:\n\nAll publicly-traded companies, and private companies with at least $100 million in revenue, must be at least 20 percent owned by their employees;\n\n45 percent of the board of directors at these companies must be directly elected by the company\u2019s workers;\n\nA ban on stock buybacks;\n\nCompanies that lay off workers to move operations overseas must share some of the \u201cgains\u201d with the laid-off American workers;\n\nCompany boards will be required to maintain representation from \u201chistorically marginalized groups\u201d (like women, LGBTQ individuals, African-Americans and others) and submit reports on the racial and sexual orientation makeup of their boards and employees to the federal government;\n\nA ban on mandatory arbitration and non-compete clauses;\n\nAnd the elimination of offshore tax havens and a corporate tax rate hike from 21 to 35 percent.\n\nAccording to the Sanders campaign estimates, under his plan Amazon would have paid $3.8 billion in taxes last year.\n\nRalph Sonenshine, assistant professor of economics at American University, thinks Sanders\u2019 plan will \u201ccreate a lot of inefficiencies and black markets where companies try to get around [his policies].\u201d\n\n\u201cAs somebody that supports a lot of Democratic agenda items, most of this would not be one of them,\u201d he told InsideSources. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in forcing corporations to do certain things, like banning stock buybacks, I think that\u2019s not good at all.\u201d\n\nSonenshine thinks Sanders could fix a lot of the economic inequalities he discusses with existing reform ideas that both progressives, neoliberals and conservatives agree on, like campaign finance reform, or minimum wage laws, which progressives and neoliberals (but not conservatives) generally agree on.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nConservatives and progressives alike often talk about closing tax loopholes to ensure a fairer, more just tax system. Sonenshine and Lawrence White, a professor of economics at New York University\u2019s Leonard N. Stern School of Business who describes himself as \u201cmarkets-oriented,\u201d approve of eliminating offshore tax havens and raising the corporate tax rate a little bit \u2014 not quite to 35 percent, but maybe around 25 percent, they said.\n\n\u201cAs far as profit-sharing arrangements, I think that\u2019s a mistake,\u201d White said. \u201cI know it works in Germany, I\u2019m less convinced it would work here. We had experiments with worker shareholding arrangements, one of the major airlines had this 15 or 20 years ago. It didn\u2019t work very well.", "description": ".10/24/2019 0:53:16AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/294/7621b548-d9cc-4581-8fa6-172533cd838e.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
