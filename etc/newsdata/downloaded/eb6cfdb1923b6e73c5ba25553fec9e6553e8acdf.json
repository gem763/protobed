An additional 7,500 asylum-seekers could be accepted who do not fit those categories.\n\n\"The current burdens on the U.S. immigration system must be alleviated before it is again possible to resettle large number of refugees,\" the administration said in a statement. \"Prioritizing the humanitarian protection cases of those already in our country is simply a matter of fairness and common sense.\"\n\nImmigration rights advocates swiftly criticized the new asylum limit, which is expected to face challenges in court.\n\nDaryl Grisgraber of Oxfam America called the announcement \"immoral and un-American.\"\n\n\"In their senseless quest to keep foreigners out, this administration proves they are willing to abandon our nation's founding principles and outright reject human rights,\" Grisgraber said.\n\nSeparately, Trump issued an executive order to allow states and localities to refuse the resettlement of refugees in their communities.\n\nRyan Mace with Amnesty International USA slammed both moves.\n\n\"To cut the number of refugees the U.S. will accept to this low of a number reflects nothing more than this administration's attempts to further hate, division, and prejudice in a country that once valued dignity, equality, and fairness.\"", "description": "The limit of 18,000 represents the lowest number of refugees allowed into the country since the modern refugee program was established in 1980.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/26/ap_19269637190097_wide-e20707349948c630fc5563525e871e243c72652e.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
