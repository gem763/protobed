We\u2019re certainly on different paths at the moment but I will always be there for him and I know he\u2019ll always be there for me.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cYou know, we don\u2019t see each other as much as we, as much as we used to because we\u2019re so busy. But I love him dearly and, you know, the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing. Just as I said, as brothers, you have good days, you have bad days.\u201d\n\nSources have confirmed to the Mirror that the brothers have spoken and \u201cfrank words were exchanged\u201d.\n\nSources close to William \u2013 who reportedly did not see the documentary ahead of its broadcast \u2013 have claimed he was \u201cfurious\u201d.\n\nKensington Palace aides were quick to suggest his feelings were out of concern for his brother and Meghan.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAn emotional Meghan spoke in the show of the \u201creally challenging\u201d time of being a new mother in the spotlight, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nThe day after it aired, William was said to be \u201cworried\u201d about the couple and \u201choped they were alright\u201d.\n\nBut Foster today revealed his source said \u201cpalace leaks\u201d had driven \u201chysteria\u201d over Harry\u2019s comments.\n\nHarry and Meghan have had mixed responses to the documentary.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIn the film, a subdued Meghan said pregnancy is a \u201cvulnerable\u201d time and not many people had asked after her wellbeing.\n\nShe added she had \u201ctried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip\u201d but was left feeling hurt over negative coverage they received.\n\nHarry told of the stress of public life too, revealing his mental health is under \u201cconstant management\u201d.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess have also been widely criticised for certain lifestyle choices over the past year. They were accused of hypocrisy over their decision to use private jets while campaigning about climate change.\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\nAnd they have been affected by the behaviour of Meghan\u2019s estranged dad Thomas, who has given embarrassing interviews in a bid to heal their rift.\n\nThe 75-year-old failed to attend her wedding last May after he was caught colluding with paparazzi. Sadly, she has not seen Thomas since before her big day and he has yet to meet her five-month-old son Archie.\n\nBut Meghan has also been accused of playing the media \u2013 with claims she briefed friends to speak to reporters.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nIn February, five close pals \u201copened up\u201d on the woman they \u201cknow and love\u201d after her fallout with Thomas.\n\nThe interview, painting Meghan in a hugely positive light, described her as a \u201cselfless friend who writes thank-you notes for reasons big and small\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Meghan was all smiles at tonight\u2019s One Young World Summit bash.\n\nShe wowed in a violet Aritzia Babaton Maxwell dress as she was greeted by Royal Albert Hall president Ian McCullough and the group\u2019s managing director, Ella Robertson.\n\n(Image: Samir Hussein/WireImage)\n\nThe summit is a global forum for young leaders, featuring 2,000 people from 190 countries.
