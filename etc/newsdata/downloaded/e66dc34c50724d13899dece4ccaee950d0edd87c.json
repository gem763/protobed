J. \u2014 NTT (TOKYO:9432), a global technology and business solutions leader, and Major League Baseball (MLB) today successfully conducted a Proof of Concept (PoC) with NTT\u2019s Ultra Reality Viewing technology (URV) as part of their recently announced multi-year technology agreement making the Japan-based company an official MLB partner in the United States. This implementation verified the feasibility of a real-time super-high definition surround video fan experience event, a first for a live sporting event in the United States.\n\nA key foundation of the partnership is a collaborative intent to create a new fan experience in the Smart World era. Ultra Reality Viewing was successfully proven at Game 3 of the American League Division Series presented by Doosan between the Houston Astros and Tampa Bay Rays from Tropicana Field. In the ballpark, NTT installed multiple 4K cameras that transmitted high definition images (12K wide) in real time to a super-wide screen (90.6 in x 469 in) with 6ch surround sound including original audio sauce to a viewing area set up at MLB Network\u2019s studio in Secaucus, NJ. This URV technology created a uniquely transformative sensation that put the remote viewer into the ballpark and its atmosphere live.\n\nEnterprise Partners were invited to this viewing event in order to increase the awareness for other potential uses of this Ultra Reality Viewing experience technology. NTT and MLB will continue to work toward expanding the use of URV Technology for new and exciting fan experiences in other events.\n\nURV Movie: https://youtu.be/De3UsAF0Ebc\n\nNotes:\n\nAbout Ultra Reality Viewing\n\nUltra Reality Viewing is NTT\u2019s real-time super high-definition surround video synthesis technology that combines multiple 4K camera images into a super-wide image such as 12K in real-time and transmits them synchronously to remote locations. With the super high-definition surround videos which cannot be captured by general cameras and audio technologies which enable original sounds to generate and transmit to remote location without loss and time difference and regenerate those certain sounds fields through the remote location, audiences can view sports or events content as if they were watching it live in the stadium, on the field or in the theatre. This is a proven solution based on NTT\u2019s unique R&D technology, \u201cKirari!(*1).\u201d It has been successfully implemented in Japan to enhance audience viewing and fan experiences with very positive results.\n\n(*1) For more information about NTT R&D technology \u201cKirari!\u201d, please visit https://www.ntt.co.jp/activity/en/innovation/kirari/.\n\nAbout MLB\n\nMajor League Baseball (MLB) is the most historic professional sports league in the United States and consists of 30 member clubs in the U.S. and Canada, representing the highest level of professional baseball.
