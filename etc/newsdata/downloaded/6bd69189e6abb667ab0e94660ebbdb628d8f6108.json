You\u2019re absolutely right, he's making her think she stands a chance.\n\n\"He could have shut this down ages ago, but he didn\u2019t. He\u2019s loving it. Why has he even kept the letter?\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"Nobody declares their love like this unless they've been lead on.\n\n\n\n\"I think your husband is being a d*** here. He hasn't discouraged her at all.\"\n\nA third said more bluntly: \"No. She is irrelevant to you, your husband is a d***. When he gets home from work tell him to p*** off and go and live with her.\"\n\nWe think Jason's got some explaining to do.", "description": "She found a letter to her partner from another woman saying she wants a future with him", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty", "Getty Images Picture Press Rm"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14984710.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Portrait-of-woman-the-desk-with-laptop-hands-closing-face.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
