A CIA assessment concluded last year that Prince Mohammed ordered the killing. Riyadh has denied the crown prince\u2019s involvement.\n\n\u201cIt happened under my watch. I get all the responsibility because it happened under my watch,\u201d the crown prince is quoted as saying in a December 2018 interview with broadcaster PBS, part of a documentary expected to air ahead of the first anniversary of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death. PBS released a clip and a summary of the program on Thursday.\n\nJamal Khashoggi was killed by Saudi operatives in Istanbul in October.

We have 3 million government employees,\u201d he is quoted as saying.\n\nThe murder shattered the crown prince\u2019s image in global public opinion and strained the kingdom\u2019s alliance with the U.S. Its fallout slowed foreign investment in the kingdom and complicated the crown prince\u2019s plans to overhaul the Saudi economy to make it less dependent on oil.\n\nSaudi Arabia also lost support among some U.S. officials in Washington, including influential members of Congress, leaving the kingdom more isolated as it faces attacks on its oil infrastructure.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What steps, if any, should the U.S. take in light of the crown prince\u2019s statement? Join the conversation below.\n\nPresident Trump stood by Prince Mohammed, saying it wasn\u2019t clear whether he had any role in the killing, placing the president at odds with lawmakers from both parties. Members of Congress called for accountability over the murder and a broad re-evaluation of the decades-old American-Saudi alliance.\n\nIn the murder, a team of Saudi operatives flew to Istanbul and dismembered Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s body inside the consulate. Saudi officials initially denied any knowledge of the killing and claimed that the journalist had left the consulate safely.\n\nWhen asked how Saudi officials could have taken the private jets used in the operation, he said to PBS, \u201cI have officials, ministers to follow things, and they\u2019re responsible, they have the authority to do that.\u201d\n\nFrom the Archives Representatives of Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the U.S. have been at odds about what happened to missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, until Saudi Arabia confirmed that he was killed in its consulate in Istanbul. Here\u2019s how each country\u2019s narrative unfolded.

He\u2019s a Saudi citizen and we are very keen to know what happened to him,\u201d the prince said at the time.\n\nA group of 11 Saudis including senior intelligence and security officials are on trial for the murder in a secretive court proceeding in Riyadh.\n\nOne of Prince Mohammed\u2019s top advisers, Saud al-Qahtani, was sanctioned by the U.S. for his role in the killing, but isn\u2019t on trial. He was fired from his position in the Saudi Royal Court following the killing. He continues to play an informal advisory role, U.S. officials have said.\n\nProsecutors in the Saudi trial have presented evidence that implicates Mr. Qahtani, who has long been considered Prince Mohammed\u2019s right-hand man.\n\nA United Nations investigation of the killing concluded that there was credible evidence that warranted further investigation of Prince Mohammed\u2019s possible role in the murder.\n\nWrite to Jared Malsin at jared.malsin@wsj.com", "description": "Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman acknowledged the murder of Jamal Khashoggi happened under his watch but denied any role, in a PBS interview.", "authors": ["Jared Malsin", "Jared.Malsin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-111195/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
