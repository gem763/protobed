This week, military aviation site Alert-5 caused quite a buzz among UFO and aviation enthusiasts when it shared several images of a curiously shaped craft it labeled a \u201cChinese UFO.\u201d The following day, state-run Chinese media outlet Global Times wrote that the attack chopper has a name: the \u201cSuper Great White Shark.\u201d\n\nDescribed as a \u201csci-fi like aircraft \u201c by Chinese media, designers say the Super Great White Shark\u2019s \u201chigh-speed and stealth capabilities could give the weapon an edge on the battlefield.\u201d But aerospace engineers and aviation historians say that the aircraft\u2019s design isn\u2019t new, and that it\u2019s unlikely it\u2019ll ever actually get very far off the ground.\n\nMaking its big debut at last week\u2019s China Helicopter Exposition in Tianjin, a nearby information placard described the rotorcraft as an \u201carmed helicopter\u201d featuring \u201ca composite wing-body fusion high-speed helicopter configuration designed for the future digital information battlefield.\u201d Also dubbed \u201cSuper Jaws\u201d by Chinese media, designers say the craft \u201crefers to the international excellent and mature helicopter design technologies\u201d and specifically names the US\u2019s AH-64 Apache and CH-53 Sea Stallion, along with Russia\u2019s Ka-52 and Mi-26. It\u2019s unknown how these other traditional rotorwing designs compare with the \u201cThe Great White Shark,\u201d As two of the listed models are attack helicopters, and the others are heavy transport aircraft.\n\nEnglish translations from an accompanying schematic say the\"Super Great White Shark\" will capable of traveling a little over 400 mph with a maximum ceiling of almost 20,000 feet. The concept rotorcraft has \u201ctwo turbojet engines that could provide huge horizontal thrust for high speed movement\u201dand the \u201cfuselage is coated with stealth materials,\u201d claims Chinese media.\n\nWhile designers describe the craft as making use of \u201cinternationally popular wing-body fusion design\u2019 to create \u201ca new type of high-speed helicopter,\u201d at present, the Super Great White Shark doesn\u2019t appear to show many differences from ducted-fan aircraft designs attempted and later abandoned by the United States military over 60 years ago.\n\nSchematic diagram of the craft\n\nUsing the same general concept to achieve lift and thrust as conventional rotor based aircraft, instead of mounting propellers on the outside, ducted-fan vehicles contain internal propellers within a larger housing. Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Army and NASA experimented with several aircraft with ducted-fan based propulsion systems. It was relatively quickly determined that, in comparison to conventional airplanes and helicopters, there were no real advantages to a ducted-fan based aircraft.\n\nNotably, the Super Great White Shark bears a striking resemblance to the U.S. Air Force, and later Army\u2019s, most famous attempt at creating a saucer-shaped aircraft and the Avro Canada VZ-9 Avrocar. Not technically based on ducted-fan propulsion, the Avrocar attempted to use the so-called Coanda effect by using three jet blowing exhausts through the craft\u2019s circular rim to achieve lift and thrust. When initial Air Force visions of a Mach 3.5 fighter called the \u201cY-2\u201d were deemed dangerously unrealistic, the Army envisioned a tempered version of the flying saucer design\u2014the Avrocar\u2014as being a single replacement for both the jeep and helicopter. After three years of development, the Avrocar program was cancelled, with the saucer shaped craft never traveling more than 35mph and 3 feet off the ground.\n\nThe Avrocar.
