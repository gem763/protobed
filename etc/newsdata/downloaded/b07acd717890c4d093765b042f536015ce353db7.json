When asked if she thought there would be another black lead in the future for the reality show, Rachel remained discouraged.\n\n'After what happened with Mike, I\u2019m not hopeful at all,' Rachel, who was the first and only black lead for the franchise, said.\n\nNot hopeful: Rachel Lindsay, 34, (pictured with husband Bryan Abasolo) was on The Bachelorette in 2017 and was its first black leading lady\n\nFrustrated: She clapped back at ABC after it decided to pick Peter Weber instead of Mike Johnson for the next Bachelor star\n\nWrong decision? ABC announced in September that Peter (right) would be the newest Bachelor over Mike (left), which sparked some controversy\n\n'That\u2019s why I keep talking about it because maybe it\u2019ll start the conversation and maybe it\u2019ll change,' she added.\n\nMike Johnson, 31, appeared on Hannah Brown's Bachelorette season and was briefly rumored to be the next Bachelor for the reality show.\n\nThis decision would've been groundbreaking for the series, as the show has yet to have a black Bachelor represent the cast.\n\nBut ABC picked pilot Peter Weber, 28 \u2014 who also appeared on Hannah's season \u2014 to instead take his chance on finding the love of his life.\n\n'If Mike can\u2019t get it, what\u2019s the reason?' Lindsay asked. She went on to list other black female contestants who were on the show recently but lost out on the chance to be Bachelorette after ABC picked Hannah.\n\n'Even after me, you\u2019ve had Sienne, you\u2019ve had Tayshia. Not that Hannah B. was bad. But she was number nine. Tayshia was number three [of Colton Underwood\u2019s contestants],' she said, adding: 'Usually the system picks one of the top four, why not? Before, the excuse would be, \"No one is making it far enough.\" Now they are. So now what?'\n\nThe one and only: The franchise has yet to cast another black male or female to lead the show. Rachel was its first and only black lead in 2017\n\nFrustrated: 'After what happened with Mike, I\u2019m not hopeful at all,' Rachel said about the show casting another black lead in the near future\n\nBryan also spoke about the decision and hoped the reality show would be able to amend its decision next year after Peter's season.\n\n'I hope next year, the 25th Bachelor anniversary, they go back and choose Mike. If not, there\u2019s another great candidate,' Bryan said.\n\nWhen the news was first announced last month, Rachel also spoke out against the decision.\n\nShe told Entertainment Tonight that while Peter might seem 'lovely' and 'a very nice guy', he was too cookie-cutter and someone audience members have seen many times before.\n\n'This is absolutely nothing against him, but how many Peters have we seen before? What season are we on? 24. So, we've seen 24 Peters,' Rachel said. 'I'm bored. And it's nothing personal against him.'\n\nRachel went on to state she believed Mike 'checked all the boxes' for the reality show. Yet he was not picked as the newest Bachelor.\n\n'We need to change the system,' she said. 'Something has to be done. Break the rules, step outside the box, give the people what they want.'\n\nThe decision shocked Rachel, so she felt it was her obligation to speak against the decision and make her voice heard.\n\n'For the first time, I was very confident that we were going to see our first black Bachelor,' she said. 'And so if no one else is going to speak on it, then I guess it's my duty to say it.'\n\nDrama: Mike was briefly rumored to be the new Bachelor. He also recently spoke out against ABC following the decision to choose Peter instead\n\nRun of the mill: In an interview, Mike said he supported Peter in his new journey but thought it was time for a black Bachelor to get cast for the reality show\n\nMike also expressed shock by the decision because he believed he had a shot at becoming the next Bachelor.\n\n'After 24 Bachelors, a black Bachelor should have been cast,' Mike told Entertainment Tonight last month after ABC chose another white Bachelor.\n\nHe added: 'But at the same time, ABC has been successful. They know what they\u2019re doing for their audience. They know what they\u2019re looking for. I wasn\u2019t the guy they were looking for at the moment.'\n\nThe reality show did not explain to Mike why they picked Peter over him.\n\nBut Mike told the publication that he had a hunch as to possibly why the show went in the direction it's often gone in the past when casting.\n\n'I do know that Peter and I are two completely different people \u2014 both good people, kind-hearted people,' Mike said.\n\n'But I do feel that I\u2019m a bit more outspoken than Peter. I\u2019m a bit louder than Peter is. I have tattoos, and the obvious, I\u2019m black, so we are very diverse and different in that regard as well.\n\n'And we like different women. I want to make sure the focus is centered around love because that\u2019s what this show is about. Peter and I also are attracted to two different types of women.'\n\nThe franchise has not addressed any of the current backlash for choosing to cast Peter over Mike.", "description": "Rachel, 34, was on The Bachelorette in 2017 and was its first black leading lady.
