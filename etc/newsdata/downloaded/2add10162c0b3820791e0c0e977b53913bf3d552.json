Five years after their mother died, Rachel, a girl on the cusp of adolescence and 5-year-old Jamie find themselves on their way to the virgin gold fields with their father, Herman, as he tries to start a new life. When Jamie goes missing in a freak snow blizzard, Rachel braves the storm to look for her little brother.\n\nWHAT WE THOUGHT:\n\nThe first time I heard about the story of Racheltjie de Beer, I was in primary school. I had a lot of questions after hearing her tragic story.\n\nLike who was she before the events unfolded, what games did she like to play, did she have any friends and where were her parents? All we ever knew about her was that she sacrificed her life for her younger brother.\n\nDid I think she was a heroine? Ten-year-old me was extremely sad that she died, and years later, after seeing the movie on the big screen 35-year-old me was even sadder.\n\nWriter Brett Micheal Innes and director Matthys Boshoff have created a compelling, thought-provoking backstory for young Racheltjie that answered all of 10-year-old me's questions.\n\nBut seeing this movie through the eyes of an adult makes me realise just how heavy and unfair the weight of looking after a younger sibling is when you are a child. For me, it was a particularly difficult film to watch (perhaps I am a sensitive viewer).\n\nWhile it is a coming of age story, it is also a multigenerational story, which helps in exploring the theme of family.\n\nMarius Weyers and Sandra Prinsloo play George and Jacoba a couple in their senior years. Antoinette Louw plays Sara, their daughter, who has resigned herself to taking care of her parents.\n\nStian Bam is Herman, Racheltjie's father who is battling his own demons and finds solace at the bottom of a bottle.\n\nRacheltjie played by Zonika de Vries has a keen interest in sketching and clings to the memory of her mother through the teachings she gave her about plants. Her mother (Be\u00e1te Opperman) appears as a ghost heightening the mystery surrounding her.\n\nThrough the use of striking imagery, clever storytelling and a stellar cast, the film will leave you a bit haunted. The film has an eery feel to it, and you can feel the tension simmering as it builds up to the fatal blizzard.\n\nBoshoff incorporated a mixture of genres using horror elements and magical realism to weave a story that will have you engrossed from start to finish. The CGI used in the film is some of the best I have seen in a local movie.\n\nThe star of the movie is without a doubt, 14-year-old Zonika who epitomises Racheltjie beautifully. She gave a nuanced performance of a girl straddling the line between child and adolescence.\n\nThe seasoned ensemble cast each gives stand out performances. A must mention for Johannes Jordan, who plays Jamie. This little boy will steal your heart.\n\nThe Story of Racheltjie breathes life into the fabled tale; it is a definite must-watch. Be sure to take some tissues with you.", "description": "Through the use of striking imagery, clever storytelling and a stellar cast; writer Brett Micheal Innes and director Matthys Boshoff have created a compelling, thought-provoking backstory for the young heroine.", "authors": ["Leandra Engelbrecht"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7412/7a6d09cdb1d3429e8dcb65ea5e12a1d5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
