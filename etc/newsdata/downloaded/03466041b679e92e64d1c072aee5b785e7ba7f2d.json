They've been continuously ignored.'\n\nMr Rogers said that other industries within Australia had discussions with the government with no hassle.\n\nFestivals like Laneway Festival have said their next event may be their last, slamming the government for not enabling discussions over the future of festivals\n\n'The festival industry is fed up and we feel like we are being left with no choice. We feel incredibly disrespected.'\n\n'We feel like this could very well be our last year.'\n\nMr Rogers said the next Laneway Festival, due to be held in Sydney in February, would go ahead but it could be for the last time.\n\n'The decision (over whether to cancel) is going to me made within the next few months. We just want to be part of the conversation,' he said.\n\nCustomer Service minister Victor Dominello introduced The Music Festivals Bill 2019 to Parliament last Wednesday.\n\n'This new scheme is not about targeting certain festivals or trying to shut them down, far from it,' Mr Dominello told the parliament.\n\n'It is about ensuring that the NSW music festival scene is known not only for its wide range of offerings, exciting acts and vibrant experiences, but for having a well coordinated approach when planning these important events.\n\nFuzzy Operations, which runs festivals like Listen Out and Field Day have also voiced their frustration with the NSW government.\n\nAcross NSW festivals during 2017-2019, six people aged between 18 and 23 all died from drug related causes prompting the government to look into pill testing\n\nEarlier this year, Mountain Sounds Festival was cancelled after being slapped with a $200,000 bill for security and safety measures\n\n'Yet again, last week we saw new legislation for music festivals introduced by this government without any consultation,' managing director Adelle Robinson told The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nLive Performance Australia chief executive Evelyn Richardson said the loss of music festivals in the state would be a 'major blow' to everyone.\n\n'It would be a major blow for fans, artists and all those people in communities across NSW who benefit culturally and economically from music festivals if we were to see music festivals forced to leave,' Ms Richardson said.\n\nEarlier this year, the Mountain Sounds Festival was cancelled with organisers blaming the governments 'war on festivals'.\n\nThe cancellation came a week before the event - scheduled for 15 and 16 Feb at the Mount Penang Parklands in New South Wales' Central Coast.\n\nNSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian ignored the push for pill testing, saying the deaths of those at festivals were from pure MDMA (pictured: reveller at Groovin the Moo festival in Canberra supporting pill testing)\n\nAmid increased political scrutiny over festivals, organisers said they were slapped with a $200,000 bill for security and safety measures.\n\nThe Music Festivals Bill comes after NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the government would ignore recommendations from the state coroner to implement pill testing at festivals.\n\n'Our heart goes out to families who've lost a loved one under these circumstances but unfortunately it's been found that (it's) the pure drug, it's pure MDMA, that is killing young people,' Ms Berejiklian told ABC radio last week.\n\n'We would say to young people, do not take these drugs because you or your loved ones could suffer as a result.'\n\nAcross NSW festivals during 2017-2019, six people aged between 18 and 23 all died from drug related causes.\n\nAlex Ross-King, 19, Joshua Tam, 22, Callum Brosnan, 21, Diana Nguyen, 21, Joseph Pham, 23, and Nathan Tran, 18, died after attending the events.\n\nAlex Ross-King (left), 19, and Joshua Tam (right), 22, are two of the young people whose deaths are being discussed during the coronial inquest", "description": "Festivals such as Laneway and Splendour in the Grass are threatening to cancel their New South Wales shows in the wake of a new bill that requires festivals to develop new safety plans.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/04/20017426-0-image-a-2_1571713370066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
