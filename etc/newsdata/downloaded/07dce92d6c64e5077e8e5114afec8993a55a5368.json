Nationals react to interference debacle as Torre defends call", "language": "en", "text": "HOUSTON \u2014 Dave Martinez began to step away from home plate umpire Sam Holbrook, appearing ready to wrap up his diatribe and return to the Washington Nationals\u2018 dugout. Crew chief Gary Cederstrom then pointed at Martinez\u2019s chest and began to shout, to which Martinez responded in kind.\n\nWashington bench coach Chip Hale wrestled his livid boss several steps away from the umpires, but Martinez pushed back. First base coach Tim Bogar came to help \u2014 now two men were restraining Martinez. The manager struggled with every step as he shouted at the umpires. Holbrook stared him down, motionless, as Martinez was brought further and further away.\n\nThen came Holbrook\u2019s ejection motion. Martinez saw it, barreled through his coaches, spun around to try to shake Hale loose and launched a final barrage of shouting square into Holbrook\u2019s face.\n\nThe Nationals have disagreed with many of this crew\u2019s calls all series, and blood had been steadily boiling until this moment. But Martinez\u2019s protest of the umpires\u2019 decision to call Trea Turner out on baserunner interference during Game 6 of the World Series was a rare display of extreme anger from the good-natured skipper.\n\nMartinez was the first manager ejected from a World Series game since Bobby Cox in 1996. But after the game, he shifted into passive mode, saying he didn\u2019t want to take attention off his team\u2019s 7-2 win that forced a Game 7 \u2014 even as MLB chief baseball officer Joe Torre defended Holbrook\u2019s call as being correct.\n\n\u201cIn the heat of the moment things get blown out of hand,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI saw things differently. But I\u2019m not going to \u2014 like I said, I\u2019m never going to criticize any umpires or anything, because they\u2019re a big part of the game.\u201d\n\nDave Martinez is about to fight everyone who\u2019s ever been an umpire pic.twitter.com/cr42IdmDmd \u2014 Starting 9 (@Starting9) October 30, 2019\n\nTorre said the violation occurred when Turner prevented Houston first baseman Yuli Gurriel from being able to catch a ball thrown to him.\n\nThe problem: Turner was running straight ahead in the basepath, simply lunging one last stride to the bag to try to beat the throw. With the throw a bit off-target, Gurriel\u2019s glove moved over to attempt the catch \u2014 and Turner made incidental contact with the glove.\n\nTurner was asked whether he watched the replay during the umpires\u2019 review, looking for what he could have done to avoid the call.\n\n\u201cI mean, what else do you do?\u201d Turner said. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 the batter\u2019s box is in fair territory, first base is in fair territory. I swung, I ran a straight line. I got hit with the ball. I\u2019m out. I don\u2019t understand it. I mean I could understand it if I had like veered one way or another. I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBut Torre argued that Turner was running inside the line toward the grass infield rather than the 45-foot line.\n\n\u201cIf he had been running in the 45-foot line he\u2019d have been coming from a different angle and the first baseman may have had an easier chance catching the ball,\u201d Torre said. \u201cBut as you know, as you saw, the glove came off Gurriel\u2019s hand and he wasn\u2019t doing anything but trying to catch the ball. And my view, if he catches the ball, Turner, he\u2019s fast, but he hadn\u2019t gotten to first base yet.\u201d\n\nDuring the ordeal, a hot microphone caught Turner saying, \u201cWhy are you hiding?\u201d It was clear whom that was directed toward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably get in trouble for all this, but Joe Torre\u2019s in charge of the umpires, and I think if we want clarification, then we should do everything we possibly can to get the calls on the field right,\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s in the rules that I did the wrong thing then so be it. But I think this stage is just too big and too important to a lot of people to have every avenue not taken advantage of, I guess \u2026 I just think we should do everything we can to get everything as right as possible, and let the players decide the outcome.\u201d\n\nWord spread after the play that the Nationals would play the rest of the game under protest, but teams are not allowed to protest a judgment call. Martinez later admitted that he knew the rules, and his protest was for \u201chonestly nothing\u201d other than to try to force a rules check.\n\n\u201cI mean, I wanted them to go look at the replay. Go look and just give me a rules check, that\u2019s all,\u201d he said. \u201cThey came back and honestly, that was it. I dropped it. Done. They went and checked. They spent a few minutes. I\u2019ve done it before knowing that you can\u2019t do anything about it. And then things escalated.\u201d\n\nTorre said on the Fox\u2019s postgame coverage that Martinez was \u201cout of control,\u201d leading to his ejection.\n\nIn the clubhouse, Ryan Zimmerman said the bang-bang play at first was not that unusual to see.\n\n\u201cThe game is so fast. That\u2019s a tough call,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cLike the other night, I don\u2019t like to talk about the umpires. They have the hardest job in the world.\u201d\n\nMuch worse could have transpired if the Nationals hadn\u2019t gone on to win \u2014 if the potential run they lost with Turner ruled out would have been a difference-maker. Instead, Anthony Rendon stepped up two batters later and belted a two-run home run, then added a two-run double in the ninth inning, padding a lead that was enough to take the game.\n\nAccording to Turner, there was no extra emotion in the dugout celebration of Rendon\u2019s home run after what had just transpired.\n\n\u201cNo, I think for me, it\u2019s just having a bigger lead in Game 6 and an elimination game in the World Series. Nothing more than that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put stuff behind you and I felt like we did. We moved on. I thought we played great after that as well. I think we, like I keep saying, we have all the motivation we need. We know what\u2019s at stake. We don\u2019t need extra motivation or people to say things or do things or whatever it is. We feel good.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
