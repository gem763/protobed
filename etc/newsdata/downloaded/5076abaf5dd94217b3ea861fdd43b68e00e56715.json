Greeks embrace the end of an era of rage\n\nFor years the five-storey building at 131 Mesogeion Avenue embodied the success of Golden Dawn, the neo-Nazi party that took Greece, and Europe, by storm. Today, its tattered flag, broken signage and shuttered doors have come to tell another story: of Golden Dawn\u2019s rise and fall on the back of rage and economic crisis, hate-mongering, murder and criminal charges. \u201cThe people put them in, the people threw them out,\u201d quips Giorgos Mavroeidis, the manager of a health-appliance shop two stores down. \u201cWe got used to the rallies in the end but they were extremists to be sure,\u201d he says of the black-clad staff and supporters who would frequent the building, the party\u2019s national headquarters. \u201cIt\u2019s strange to think of us being so close to them now.\u201d\n\n'Their ideas had no place here': how Crete kicked out Golden Dawn Read more\n\nLast week, movers turned up, taking anything that could be transported from 131 Mesogeion and leaving only \u201cDawn\u201d in the signage that had so vividly proclaimed the presence of one of Europe\u2019s most violent ultra-nationalist organisations on Greece\u2019s fractured political landscape.\n\nFor a party that had once been the country\u2019s third-largest political force \u2013 polling close to 7% when it was first catapulted into parliament in 2012 \u2013 the move, symbolically, marked more than a change in fortunes even if Nikos Michaloliakos, its \u201csupreme F\u00fchrer\u201d, as supporters are believed to have called him, insisted it amounted only to downsizing.\n\n\u201cIf we could also owe millions we\u2019d keep it,\u201d he tweeted, alluding to the restricted finances that had followed Golden Dawn\u2019s narrow failure to win a single seat in the Athens parliament in snap polls in July. The group was simply returning to its \u201coffices of victory\u201d \u2013 premises located in a much less salubrious suburb \u2013 from whence it had begun its rapid ascent, he countered.\n\nWhere once we had spoken of its rise, we can now speak of its fall. Golden Dawn is in its last throes Dimitris Psarras, writer\n\nBut this month, amid feuds and factional infighting, the far-rightists were closing branches, one after the other, across Greece. An era defined by the politics of hate \u2013 epitomised by night rallies with flaming torches and Nazi salutes and hit squads sowing panic and fear with coordinated attacks on immigrants, trade unionists and political opponents \u2013 appeared to have come full circle.\n\nFor those who have long chronicled Golden Dawn, it was dissolving fast.\n\n\u201cWhere once we had spoken of its rise, we can now speak of its fall,\u201d said Dimitris Psarras, the leftist writer who has followed the neofascist group since its foundation in 1980 on the brittle landscape that emerged after the collapse of rightwing military rule.\n\n\u201cGolden Dawn is in its last throes. Several of its most prominent MPs have left,\u201d he said, adding that the latest defection of the Euro MP Yannis Lagos, who has stated there was no evidence of wrongdoing against far-rightists, had sealed the party\u2019s plummeting fortunes. \u201cIt\u2019s being torn apart \u2026 If elections were to take place today it would get less than half of the 2.9% it managed to pick up in July.\u201d\n\nPsarras is in no doubt that the victory of Greece\u2019s centre-right New Democracy partly accounts for the neofascists\u2019 decline. At the height of the extremists\u2019 appeal, as the debt-stricken nation wrestled with bankruptcy, 500,000 Greeks voted in favour of Golden Dawn. Most votes were cast in working-class districts by people who wanted to punish a political system they blamed for the country\u2019s near economic collapse and their own impoverishment and despair. But the age of rage is now believed to have passed.\n\nWorn down by years of relentless austerity \u2013 the price of successive bailouts from the EU and IMF \u2013 the deep wells of anger the neo-Nazis had tapped into have gradually dried up. Greeks, in contrast to other Europeans, have turned their backs on populism, abandoning fringe politics and the fiery rhetoric of Syriza, the leftist radicals in power since 2015, for a party that has promised to be tough on law and order and step up patrols on Greece\u2019s porous borders.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Golden Dawn supporters protest against the building of a mosque in Athens in 2018.

The cold-blooded murder of Pavlos Fyssas, a popular anti-fascist Greek rapper, by one of Golden Dawn\u2019s senior operatives, sent a chill through Greek society and went some way to cutting the organisation\u2019s well-documented ties with security forces in the \u201cdeep state\u201d.\n\nOn Wednesday, thousands took to the streets of the gritty working-class suburb of Keratsini, where the 34-year-old musician died of knife wounds to the heart, six years ago.\n\n\u201cUntil then, only immigrants had been targeted because they were \u2018invisible\u2019, \u2018anonymous\u2019 and \u2018helpless,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a Greek was so brutally killed it ended the politics of tolerance towards the organisation\u2019s crimes.\u201d\n\nGreek Golden Dawn member arrested over murder of leftwing hip-hop artist Read more\n\nThe assassination sparked an unprecedented investigation into the group\u2019s embrace of the murderous violence inherent in Nazi ideology and is the basis for a trial that has placed 69 Golden Dawn members, including its entire leadership, in the dock. All stand accused of operating a criminal organisation, a charge that they deny.\n\nMore than four years later, as it enters its final stage, the hearing has exposed the group\u2019s activities as never before. \u201cGolden Dawn\u2019s death is a natural death,\u201d said Ilias Stavrou, a former member who had once run on the party\u2019s ticket as a parliamentary candidate before also defecting. \u201cAs a political force it never managed to expand,\u201d the 32-year-old lawyer told the Observer. \u201cLess than 15% of its voters ever visited a party office and that\u2019s because there was always the dilemma of whether it should open up about its real ideology, which was all about Hitler and national socialism, or reject it and risk offending its hardcore members.\u201d\n\nGreece\u2019s rejuvenated anti-fascist movement is rejoicing. The defeat of the far-rightists \u2013 a blow for neo-fascist movements across Europe \u2013 has been attributed to the coordinated efforts of a diverse, anti-fascist and anti-racist movement that has also taken to the streets.\n\n\u201cGolden Dawn, as we know it, is over,\u201d smiles the prominent anti-fascist activist Petros Constantinou. \u201cWhenever they were on the streets, we too, were out in force. But the fight goes on. We still have to root out all those far-right people with links in the police and security services in this country. And lest we forget, please write about the victims. There were so many migrants, young people whose names we will never know, who died on these streets at the hands of Golden Dawn.\u201d", "description": "The neo-Nazi party\u2019s Athens offices have downsized and it has closed offices across the country.
