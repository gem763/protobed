Yovanovitch, who was withdrawn earlier this year, told investigators last week that the president ousted her on \u201cunfounded and false claims.\u201d\n\nPrevious witnesses have described how policy staff were sidelined on Ukraine by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and others. NBC News reported that investigators expect to hear next week from Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor, who raised concerns that security aid was being withheld to pressure Ukraine. Reuters was unable to immediately verify that report.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve uncovered significant evidence of Trump\u2019s abuse of power. And we\u2019ll continue to expose the truth,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment inquiry, said on Twitter on Wednesday.\n\nTrump denounced the inquiry as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d on Twitter early on Wednesday and later told reporters that Democrats were being disrespectful. He accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of handing out subpoenas \u201clike cookies.\u201d\n\nIn related news, the FBI on Wednesday arrested David Correia, one of four people charged last week in an alleged scheme to funnel $1 million in donations to politicians and political candidates to benefit a planned marijuana business funded by an unnamed Russian businessman.\n\nREPUBLICAN BLASTS \u2018CLOSED SYSTEM\u2019\n\nRamping up attacks on Democrats, House Republicans complained of being denied access to witness transcripts and said they would introduce a censure resolution against Schiff.\n\nA House vote to impeach Trump would lead to a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate that could result in his ouster. But so far, few Senate Republicans have criticized the president.\n\nMichael McKinley, former senior adviser to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, arrives to testify at a closed-door deposition as part of the impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Trump led by the House Intelligence, House Foreign Affairs and House Oversight and Reform Committees on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 16, 2019.

Zelenskiy agreed to investigate. Trump eventually allowed the aid.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and defended his request to Zelenskiy. Biden and his son also deny wrongdoing.\n\nPompeo, a close Trump ally, has directed State Department employees not to cooperate with the inquiry, but with only limited success.\n\nCareer diplomat George Kent testified on Tuesday. Congressional investigators also heard on Monday from Trump\u2019s former Russia adviser, Fiona Hill.\n\nGordon Sondland, a Trump political donor and a key actor in the unfolding political drama as U.S. ambassador to the European Union, is expected to appear this week in response to a subpoena after he initially declined to testify.\n\nText messages from Taylor to Sondland appear to support a link between aid and pressure on Ukraine. Taylor complained in one message that the aid delay had shaken Ukraine\u2019s faith in Washington. In another, he said: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nA man rides his bike past the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, U.S., October 15, 2019.

The Pentagon also said it could not to share documents with lawmakers. The White House budget office also faced a Tuesday deadline to respond.\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry declined to tell an interviewer whether he would comply with a subpoena for documents.", "description": "A former adviser to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who abruptly resigned last week spoke on Wednesday to an impeachment inquiry into allegations President Donald Trump pursued political interests in his dealings with Ukraine.", "authors": ["Richard Cowan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441563893&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1B4", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
