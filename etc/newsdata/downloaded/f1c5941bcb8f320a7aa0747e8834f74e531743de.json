It staged a comeback into cancer treatments with a $5.1 billion buyout of U.S. drugmaker Tesaro in December last year.\n\n\"This agreement with Bavarian Nordic will enable us to commit greater resources to our key growth assets and to our R&D pipeline,\" Roger Connor, president of Global Vaccines at GSK said.\n\nGSK, which is preparing to separate its consumer-facing products and drugs businesses, acquired the vaccines from Novartis in 2015 as part of a broad asset-swap https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gsk-novartis-oncology/novartis-ag-wins-approval-to-buy-gsk-cancer-drugs-with-conditions-idUSKBN0LR1JT20150223 in which GSK sold its oncology business to the Swiss drugmaker.\n\nThe drugmaker reported revenue of 5.89 billion pounds ($7.61 billion) from its vaccines segment in 2018.\n\nLondon-listed GSK said that both vaccines will continue to be manufactured at its Marburg site in Germany until full production is transferred to Bavarian Nordic within five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Aakash Jagadeesh Babu and Pushkala Aripaka in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)", "description": "The sale of anti-rabies treatment Rabipur and Encepur, used  for the prevention of tick-borne encephalitis, to the Denmark-based biotechnology firm includes an upfront payment of 301 million euros and milestone payments of up to 495 million euros.
