It\u2019s become a $5.1 billion global business.\n\nUnder Armour Inc. has threatened Nike, landing major deals with Major League Baseball and star athletes like the NBA\u2019s Stephen Curry.\n\nBut it also faces threats of its own, like the growing popularity of athleisure wear, clothing that can be worn from work straight to the yoga studio.\n\nLast year Under Armour said that it was cutting about 400 jobs as part of its restructuring efforts. The company began streamlining in 2017 after explosive sales growth petered out as consumers shifted some of their dollars toward active lifestyle brands like Lululemon.\n\nShares of the Baltimore company are down 23% since its last earnings report in July. Its stock rose 15 cents to $18.32 per share Tuesday.", "description": "BALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Under Armour founder Kevin Plank will step down as CEO in the new year to become the company\u2019s executive chairman and brand", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Richard-Drew-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
