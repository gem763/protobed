(Photo: Mark Phelan)\n\nFord is about to mark 40 years of offering one of the auto industry\u2019s least known but most appreciated features: the SecuriCode keypad.\n\nMillions of Ford and Lincoln owners have used the feature. Demand is so strong that when Ford launched a vehicle without it, the company had to scramble to add it.\n\nAmazingly, the keypad remains a Ford specialty. In an industry that believes imitation is the most profitable form of flattery, no other automaker has successfully copied the formula that\u2019s captivated two generations of Ford owners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s standard in probably 90% of the vehicles we sell to the public,\u201d said Ruben Correa, salesman at the massive Galpin Ford in Los Angeles. SecuriCode is available on every vehicle Ford and Lincoln make except for a few models that are sold primarily to commercial fleets, like utility trucks. Ford says SecuriCode costs less than $50 on the vehicles where it\u2019s an option.\n\nThe feature is particularly popular with people who enjoy hiking, swimming, bicycling and other outdoor action sports. They leave their keys in the vehicle, lock it and use a combination only they know to re-enter. No worry about losing keys or replacing expensive electronic fobs. As new features like Lincoln\u2019s Phone as a Key allow drivers to use smartphones to unlock and start vehicles, the keypad still provides a way to keep the iPhone safe and dry while you snorkel or ski.\n\nCar rental winners and losers: Best (and worst) rental companies\n\nHefty trucks: The heaviest on the market\n\nSecuriCode isn\u2019t just for the great outdoors, though. I never understood why owners love it until a bitterly cold January night when a Free Press photo editor raved about leaving her Ford Explorer Sport Trac locked, running, warm and secure as she picked up pizza to feed her staff in downtown Detroit.\n\nShe swore she\u2019d never buy a vehicle without the keypad. I think our photographers would have revolted if she did.\n\nThe control moved to the car's B-pillar and a keypad replaced buttons on the 2009 Lincoln MKS sedan. (Photo: Lincoln)\n\nWhen did the touchpad debut?\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to make a touchpad that works all the time in all weather conditions. That may be why no other automaker has offered the feature as long or on as many vehicles, Ford switches and mechatronics manager Joe Scott said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to design a switch that\u2019s accessible from outside the vehicle,\u201d Scott said. \u201cFord puts a lot of effort into making sure the customer can lock and unlock their vehicle. When people go away from Ford, they miss it.\u201d\n\nGetting into your vehicle can\u2019t be a sometime thing. Imagine the consequences if a hiker fleeing a wildfire or a family rushing a child to the emergency room couldn\u2019t get into their Ford. You would have heard if that happened, and you haven\u2019t.\n\nFord's keyless entry feature debuted on some 1980 models including the Lincoln Continental Mark Vi. (Photo: Lincoln)\n\n\u201cA lot of people look for the keypad,\u201d said Jalen Ankton, salesman at Royal Oak Ford in Michigan. \u201cI\u2019ve never had anybody complain about it.\u201d\n\nThe feature debuted on the 1980 Ford Thunderbird, Mercury Cougar, Lincoln Continental Mark VI and Lincoln Town Car. If you were around then, you\u2019d never heard of a capacitive touchpad, much less a smartphone app. The keys were physical buttons, set into the metal of the door near the handle. Five buttons, each for two digits: 1-2; 3-4; 5-6; 7-8; 9-0.\n\nNew technology, more features\n\nIn 2009, Ford updated the technology, replacing physical buttons with a capacitive touchpad on the 2009 Lincoln MKS luxury sedan. The keypad migrated from near the exterior door handle to the B-pillar, the vertical support at the rear of the driver\u2019s door. The pad still has five touch points for 10 digits, virtually invisible under an applique on the B-pillar.\n\n\u201cIt was Ford\u2019s first capacitive switch,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt was a big challenge. It had to work with water flowing over it and at all temperatures.\u201d\n\nSome vehicles still have physical switches, notably F-150 pickups and others whose drivers are likely to wear thick work gloves. The capacitive control is designed to work with gloves up to about 1.5 mm thick.\n\nEvery once in a while, an executive with a sharp pencil and dull brain asks why Ford continues to offer a feature none of its competitors bother with.\n\nThe company got the answer when it launched the Focus compact without a touch pad.\n\n\u201cWe had to add it within a year because of customer demand,\u201d Ford electrical engineer Sony Minhas Ford said.\n\nOver the years, Ford has added features. Depending on the vehicle, the keypad can now recall a driver\u2019s preferences, open the trunk and more.\n\nKeypad on 1991 Lincoln Continental (Photo: Lincoln)\n\nNew features like Lincoln\u2019s Phone as a Key may challenge the touchpad, but SecuriCode\u2019s core benefit of leaving the phone secure in a locked vehicle remains.\n\nFord continues to refine the feature.\n\n\u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll find a user experience that\u2019s even better than the one we offer today,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe\u2019re even looking at facial recognition.\u201d\n\nContact Mark Phelan at 313-222-6731 or mmphelan@freepress.com.
