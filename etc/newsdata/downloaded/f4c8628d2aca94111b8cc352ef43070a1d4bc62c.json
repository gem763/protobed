Left indicator as soon as they pass the first exit to let other drivers know they are leaving the roundabout at the second exit,' another man wrote, with the Department saying was the correct answer.\n\nThe Department confirmed that because the blue car is travelling straight through, the driver doesn't need to indicate when they enter the roundabout.\n\n'They do though need to flick on the left indicator to exit the roundabout (and off again once they've exited),' it wrote.\n\n'If it helps you can think of a roundabout like a clock face. Any turn that exits before 12 o'clock can be considered a left turn (so you'd indicate left when you're entering the roundabout).\n\n'Any turn that exits after 12 o'clock can be considered a right turn (so you'd indicate right entering the roundabout). Straight ahead at a roundabout can be considered 12 o'clock (so you wouldn't indicate on entry).'\n\nDrivers in New South Wales aren't required to signal when approaching a roundabout when going straight ahead.\n\nBut motorists should always signal left before exiting a roundabout.\n\nDrivers in New South Wales aren't required to signal when approaching a roundabout when going straight ahead\n\n'You may approach the roundabout from either left or right lanes (unless there are road markings with other instructions), drive in the same lane through the roundabout and exit in the same lane,' NSW Roads and Maritime Services said.\n\nQueensland has similar rules, with the state government saying there is 'no need to use your indicator until you are ready to exit the roundabout.'\n\nIn Victoria, drivers shouldn't indicate as they approach the roundabout, but if practicable, signal left as they exit.", "description": "A seemingly simple road rules quiz has left drivers scratching their heads over at what point to indicate when driving through a roundabout.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/11/20030612-0-image-a-42_1571741045725.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
