Hoping for the same luck with Week 8! USA TODAY\n\nSkeptics in and around the NFL have tried to sack Kirk Cousins from the day he entered the league. But it finally appears he's fully equipped to beat the incessant blitz of criticism.\n\nCousins' performance for the Minnesota Vikings in Thursday night's 19-9 victory against the reeling Washington Redskins isn't going to make many highlight reels. But it's film he should be proud of.\n\nComing off a scalding trio of games (976 passing yards, 10 TDs and 1 INT with Minnesota averaging 36 points), Cousins entered Week 8 as the league's most efficient passer with a 114.3 QB rating. Even if he didn't fill up the box score against his former team, he maintained a steady hand on a stage where he's struggled:\n\n\u25ba He completed 23 of 26 passes for 285 yards despite lacking No. 1 receiver Adam Thielen, who sat with a hamstring injury. Cousins' 88.5% completion rate for one game established a Vikings record.\n\n\u25ba Cousins, who prepares as thoroughly as anyone in the league but sometimes looks stumped on game day \u2014 like a kid who panics when the test contains questions he wasn't aware he had to study for \u2014 didn't press against a solid Washington defense and wasn't out to make a point against a franchise that dumped him. He took what was available, content to hand off 38 times as Minnesota ground out a tough win against a team it was favored to beat by 17 points.\n\n\u25ba In so doing, Cousins is starting to look like a prime time quarterback. The win over Washington was only his second in seven Thursday games played in front of national audiences. Cousins remains 0-7 on Monday Night Football and has never tasted victory in the postseason.\n\nBut this year may be different.\n\nMinnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins celebrates during the fourth quarter against the Washington Redskins. (Photo: Brace Hemmelgarn, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Vikings seem to be lurking in the shadows even though they've now tied the 49ers, Saints and Packers with an NFC-leading sixth victory (Minnesota is currently the only team among that group to play eight times).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put ourselves in a position now where the second half of the season is going to be there for the taking, and so that\u2019s a really good thing,\" Cousins said Thursday.\n\nGive him a heaping helping of the credit.\n\nHe's been playing virtually mistake-free football for a month, finding his groove after his star targets, Thielen and Stefon Diggs, publicly threw shade his way \u2014 hardly fair in retrospect. The offense now seems better attuned to new coordinator Kevin Stefanski, who's steered away from the pass-heavy philosophy of predecessor John DeFilippo after that approach got him fired when it failed to dovetail with coach Mike Zimmer's preference for reliance on the run.\n\nThe Vikings are currently rushing more than 53% of the time, largely thanks to finally healthy Dalvin Cook (the NFL's leading rusher), and still feature what's become a perennial top-five defense under Zimmer.\n\nBut after it appeared he was on a pitch count in the opener, it's Cousins who's been driving the bus during Minnesota's four-game win streak \u2014 one that now has the team a half-game off the NFC North lead. Nineteen months after signing a three-year contract, notable because its $84 million was fully guaranteed, he looks far more comfortable after shouldering unrealistic Super Bowl hopes in 2018.\n\n(And, sure, when you get the bag, fans are going to expect you to bring home the bacon. But when was the last time a high-profile quarterback led his team to a Lombardi Trophy the same year he joined a new team? It never happens that way. Maybe backups like Trent Dilfer, Jake Delhomme or Nick Foles can sneak into town and wildly exceed expectations when the starter gets dislodged. But QB1s who arrive in a Brinks truck always need that initial year to acclimate to their coaches, teammates, organization and city.)\n\nNFL trade deadline: Seven deals that teams should make in 2019\n\nWeek 8 NFL picks: Do Patriots, 49ers remain unbeaten?\n\nAfter taking his step back in 2018, Cousins looks like a man poised to take two steps forward. And why not? He's been doing this for the better part of a decade.\n\nThis is the same pedestrian prospect the Redskins \"wasted\" a fourth-round pick on while taking Robert Griffin III second overall in 2012. The lunacy of Mike Shanahan. (FWIW, Cousins won his lone start as a rookie for the eventual NFC East champs while RG3, the offensive rookie of the year, recovered from an injury.)\n\nCousins is also the same guy given the reins by second-year Washington coach Jay Gruden \u2014 another lunatic? \u2014 at the conclusion of the 2015 preseason when most assumed the franchise mandate was to try and harness the abilities of the supremely talented Griffin. (FWIW, Cousins wound up leading the team to a rare playoff berth and paced the league with a 69.8% completion percentage.)\n\nEven after that, many scoffed at Cousins for betting on himself and \"settling\" for consecutive franchise tags rather than taking a below-market, long-term deal from the Redskins. In hindsight, given the ongoing dysfunction in D.C., would you have stayed longer? Would you remain in a situation where the team president referred to you as \"Kurt\"? Would you settle for less when the quarterback market means paying the next guy up bar-setting money \u2014 which is what happened elsewhere for the likes of Derek Carr, Matthew Stafford and Jimmy Garoppolo? (Just how are the rudderless Redskins faring post-Cousins anyway?)\n\nAnd does Cousins' pact really seem so unreasonable less than two years after he signed, now ranking seventh in terms of average annual compensation at the position? Would you rather have Cousins or Jared Goff for $110 million guaranteed?\n\nGimme \"Kurt.\"\n\nGranted, he's still got to prove he can win in January. He must summit Minnesota's seemingly insurmountable Super Bowl hump while navigating a loaded conference. He might have to beat the Patriots at the end.\n\n\"We've got some big-time games up ahead,\" said Cousins. \"The work doesn't get any easier from here.\"\n\nBut he might just be ready to do it.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis", "description": "Critics have been bashing Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins for years, but he may finally be ready to take Vikes to promised land.", "authors": ["Nate Davis", "Published A.M.
