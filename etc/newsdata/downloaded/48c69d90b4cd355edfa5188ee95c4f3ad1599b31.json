Never, ever, to anybody present as fact opinions on things you don't know. Takes great care and discipline. Be courteous and considerate always \u2014 up and down. Don't knock, don't complain \u2014 stick to constructive, serious criticism. Don't be afraid to make decisions when you have the facts on which to make them. Quantify where possible. Be open-minded but skeptical. Be prompt.\n\nHis dad's advice didn't turn him into an overnight success by any means.

I was working for my mother's agency in Chappaqua, and no one was buying houses. In eight months, I made zero sales. I rented one apartment.\"", "description": "When Netflix co-founder Marc Randolph was 21, his dad gave him eight \"rules for success.\" The original copy still hangs in his bathroom.", "authors": ["Kathleen Elkins"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106132429-1568661787480marcnetflix.jpg?v=1568757521", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
