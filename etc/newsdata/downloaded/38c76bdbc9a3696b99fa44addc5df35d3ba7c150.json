I mean, if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah,\" Zuckerberg said during a leaked meeting with employees.\n\nWhat would really \u201csuck\u201d is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy. https://t.co/rI0v55KKAi \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 1, 2019\n\n\"I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that\u2019s not the position that you want to be in,\" he added.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Warren and Zuckerberg have gone head-to-head. The social network giant removed several of the Warren presidential campaign\u2019s ads that featured the Facebook logo to promote her policy.\n\nAnd Facebook has been under siege in Washington after the Cambridge Analytica scandal and after it was revealed that Facebook was a primary platform for Russia's disinformation campaign during the 2016 election. The company has vowed to tighten restrictions that protect its consumers from privacy violation and election interference, but Warren maintains that those policies aren\u2019t enough.\n\nWarren, who has surpassed former Vice President Joe Biden in some polls, has long been a proponent for dismantling large tech companies including Facebook, Amazon and Google. In March, she rolled out a policy proposal to break up tech giants by forcing the companies to separate or sell off parts of their businesses and reverse major mergers.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/19/47/5c0dba01445f95534f7b8d638660/191001-elziabeth-warren-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
