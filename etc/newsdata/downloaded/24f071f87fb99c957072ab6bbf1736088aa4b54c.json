There is nothing worse'", "language": "en", "text": "The singer has used a Rolling Stone interview to explain her pro-Democratic politics and disavow her adoption by the far right\n\nAfter years of keeping herself at a largely indifferent remove, Taylor Swift has elaborated on her political ideology in a new interview with Rolling Stone.\n\nHarkening back to the perceived better times of the Obama years, Swift said, among other things, that she regrets not getting more involved in the 2016 election, and the way her allegiances or lack thereof have been manipulated by bad actors.\n\nFor years her reluctance to stake out a claim one way or the other made her something of a useful political totem, including, notably, when neo-Nazis and alt-right trolls adopted her as an Aryan ideal.\n\nTaylor Swift threatened to sue Microsoft over its racist chatbot Tay Read more\n\n\u201cFirstly, Taylor Swift is a pure Aryan goddess, like something out of classical Greek poetry. Athena reborn,\u201d Andre Anglin of the white supremacist blog the Daily Stormer wrote in 2016.\n\nThe admiration is not mutual, although Swift clarified she was not aware of her adoption for the racist cause at the time.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s literally nothing worse than white supremacy. It\u2019s repulsive. There should be no place for it,\u201d she told Rolling Stone.\n\nNow she\u2019s trying to learn as much as she can about politics, calling it something she\u2019s become obsessed with.\n\n\u201cI was living in this sort of political ambivalence, because the person I voted for had always won,\u201d she explained, echoing the thoughts of many liberals who never felt obliged to pay attention before the Trump era.\n\n\u201cWe were in such an amazing time when Obama was president because foreign nations respected us. We were so excited to have this dignified person in the White House. My first election was voting for him when he made it into office, and then voting to re-elect him. I think a lot of people are like me, where they just didn\u2019t really know that this could happen.\u201d\n\nNow she\u2019s focused on the 2020 election, she said, hoping that her involvement might help more than it hurts the Democrats\u2019 cause.\n\n\u201cI also don\u2019t want it to backfire again, because I do feel that the celebrity involvement with Hillary\u2019s campaign was used against her in a lot of ways,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2012 she told Time magazine that she didn\u2019t \u201ctalk about politics because it might influence other people\u201d, and that she didn\u2019t think she knew \u201cenough yet in life to be telling people who to vote for\u201d.\n\nThen in 2018 she had surprisingly come out for Phil Bredesen, candidate for Senate, and Jim Cooper for the US House in her home state of Tennessee. Bredesen would ultimately lose, but Cooper, who won, said Swift\u2019s endorsement was like \u201cmanna from heaven\u201d and called it \u201cone of the great honors\u201d of his life in an interview with the Associated Press.\n\nAt the time of the endorsements many of her fans on the right said she had made a huge mistake career-wise. Donald Trump said he now liked her music \u201cabout 25% less\u201d.\n\nLest any voters on the left think it\u2019s now safe to adopt Swift into their ranks, as of now she maintains the ideology of a centrist Democrat.\n\n\u201cI do think, as a party, we need to be more of a team,\u201d she said. \u201cWith Republicans, if you\u2019re wearing that red hat, you\u2019re one of them. And if we\u2019re going to do anything to change what\u2019s happening, we need to stick together. We need to stop dissecting why someone\u2019s on our side or if they\u2019re on our side in the right way or if they phrased it correctly. We need to not have the right kind of Democrat and the wrong kind of Democrat. We need to just be like, \u2018You\u2019re a Democrat? Sick. Get in the car. We\u2019re going to the mall.\u2019\u201d", "description": "The singer has used a Rolling Stone interview to explain her pro-Democratic politics and disavow her adoption by the far right", "authors": ["Luke O'Neil"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba876db36785425d8b931c3ad0576def4601ee78/1269_276_2780_1667/master/2780.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=95fce29a62b0b3daf139de81a17d74b9", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
