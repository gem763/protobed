Why is Donald Trump wrecking it?", "language": "en", "text": "Withdrawing U.S. troops betrays America's Kurdish allies, the same people who did most of the fighting and dying to defeat ISIS: Our view\n\nStory Highlights The abrupt move places America's security interests at risk by threatening to undo the U.S.-led campaign that destroyed the Islamic State caliphate in March.\n\nThis is the second time Trump has ordered a Syrian withdrawal after a phone call with Turkey's leader.\n\n'A precipitous withdrawal ... would only benefit Russia, Iran and the Assad regime.'\n\nAfter expending tragic sums of blood and treasure for decades in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S military finally found a formula for success in Syria at minimal American casualties and cost. Now President Donald Trump is taking a wrecking ball to the experiment.\n\nIn the name of ending America's \"ridiculous Endless Wars,\" Trump on Sunday ordered a pullback of U.S. forces from the Turkish/Syrian border. The abrupt move places America's security interests at risk by threatening to undo the U.S.-led campaign that destroyed the Islamic State caliphate in March.\n\nWithdrawing the U.S. troops also exposes America's Syrian-Kurdish allies, the same people who did most of the fighting and dying to defeat ISIS, to Turkish aggression.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who regards the Syrian Kurds as terrorists, vowed in a phone call with Trump on Sunday to send troops across the border to seize a zone 300 miles long and 20 miles deep into Syria \u2014 an area where 300,000 people could be dislocated. Trump gave the autocrat a green light, ordering the withdrawal of a small U.S. military contingent whose presence on the border, backed up by U.S. air power, had been a check against Turkish attacks on Kurdish allies.\n\nThe Kurds, who lost thousands of fighters battling ISIS, now feel betrayed, and who can blame them?\n\nThis is the second time Trump has ordered a Syrian withdrawal after a phone call with Erdogan. Earlier this year, Trump reduced to about 1,000 an already small force of U.S. troops in Syria that was working to finish off ISIS and tamp down any resurgence.\n\nA protest at the White House on Oct. 8, 2019.

His actions might also lead Syrian Democratic Forces \u2014 already stretched thin securing the former caliphate and managing detention centers crammed with 10,000 captured ISIS fighters \u2014 to shift resources and defend against invading Turkish troops.\n\nEven some of Trump's strongest Republican supporters recognize this as a strategic blunder. \"A precipitous withdrawal ... would only benefit Russia, Iran and the (Syrian dictator Bashar) Assad regime,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday, urging Trump to show leadership and reverse course.\n\nFaced with withering bipartisan opposition, Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday in a schizophrenic blast praising Turkey as a NATO ally and lucrative trading partner, while threatening Turkey with economic sanctions for \"unforced or unnecessary fighting.\"\n\nTrump also dangled a White House visit for Erdogan. The Turks, so far, appear committed to crossing the border and attacking Syrian Kurds.\n\nThe United States has for decades positioned American troops around the world, from Europe to South Korea, to help allies maintain peace. If the light American footprint in Syria can do the same, there should be no reason to rush for the exits.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.
