Not Instagram influencers, not their managers. They\u2019ve referred to him as a \u201cdoctor,\u201d but he\u2019s not an MD. They\u2019ve also called him an \u201cInstagram dad\u201d (which is the \u201cworst thing,\u201d according to Antony). He\u2019s more of a coach. But when asked to describe his role at Instagram, he can\u2019t offer up a catchy one-liner. Sure, he picks the lucky, talented people out of the billion users and blasts them off to Instagram fame, but he still thinks of himself as \u201cjust a guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what they call me as long as they keep calling me,\u201d he says.\n\nFor the launch of IGTV, the company isn\u2019t betting on an algorithm to discover talent to jump-start its long-form video competitor. Its money is on Antony, a man who came up in classic Hollywood fashion, making his name at Nickelodeon by scouting talent for the network and working alongside now-famous celebrities like Nick Cannon, Victoria Justice, and Kenan Thompson.\n\nAt Instagram, Antony finds the influencers most users don\u2019t know about yet but who he believes are destined to be stars. He ushers them into the world of Instagram and makes sure they understand how to use the platform. That\u2019s the idea, at least.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all like a family. We\u2019re all making content.\u201d\n\nThe creators and emerging talent partnerships team at Instagram is larger than just Antony. He works with three others to find emerging talent, but there are 40 employees in total, including people whose job it is to make sure that traditional celebrities get the support they need to create. All of these creators \u2014 or \u201cmanaged partners,\u201d as Instagram calls them \u2014 appreciate the hands-on help. In return, they churn out content, which is the thing Instagram needs most to make IGTV \u201cthe future of video.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in this together,\u201d Antony says. \u201cWe\u2019re all like a family. We\u2019re all making content. I actually see these guys as changing the world, the face of media.\u201d\n\nIGTV is a major point of focus this year, and Instagram\u2019s creators team, which is based in Los Angeles, has been tasked with not only identifying talent, but helping them create content on the platform, whether that\u2019s by offering studio space or money to fund their shoots. They\u2019ll support the creators, especially the ones they know make content that Instagram users will like and share. In return for taking a bet on IGTV, Instagram tells creators they\u2019ll be ahead of everyone else when it becomes a massive success. The support doesn\u2019t only extend to IGTV, but the partnerships team encourages creators to try it, especially because it\u2019ll likely have ads soon, and there\u2019s money to be made.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always said that IGTV is going to be the first monetizable platform on Instagram. It\u2019s just a matter of when, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more to come on that,\u201d Antony says. \u201cThe creators that are really leaning into it, being native to it, creating an audience there, will be the stars of tomorrow.\u201d Or so Instagram hopes.\n\nWalking around Instagram\u2019s Los Angeles campus is how I imagine a tour of a Hollywood film lot would have been in the 1940s \u2014 except, instead of bumping into Judy Garland, I meet internet celebrities.\n\nDuring my visit, I run into dancer Kaycee Rice (1.9 million followers) and her parents, the manager of Jordyn Jones (5.5 million followers), and dancer Susie Meoww (351K followers). I planned to chat with comedian Adam Waheed (1.2 million followers), but following him around the office means constant 10-minute delays while Instagram employees stop him to say hi and chat about how things are going. I can see why creators like visiting the campus. It\u2019s like Instagram employs people who want to talk to you all of the time but only about things you\u2019ve made and how you\u2019re feeling.\n\nWhile platforms are often criticized for not caring about creators and treating them as expendable, Instagram\u2019s working to keep them happy. Antony\u2019s team alone works with up to 1,000 creators.\n\n\u201cI want to be the one that creates the data versus looking at the data.\u201d\n\nFadia Kader, who manages partnerships with musicians, has a team that\u2019s focused on helping musicians understand how to use Instagram. (She basically gives best practices for album releases or the Grammys.) She works with 50 to 100 artists at any given time. Antony\u2019s team, on the other hand, supports more artists because, he explains, \u201csome eggs take longer to hatch.\u201d\n\nAntony tells me he mostly scouts using his gut instinct and eye for talent, and he doesn\u2019t rely on Instagram\u2019s tech to tell him who\u2019s destined to be a star. At a networking lunch months ago, he mentioned that he receives a printout of who\u2019s trending. But when I ask about that during my most recent trip, he says it isn\u2019t as special as it sounds. The team just uses publicly available software to track Instagram creators\u2019 engagement, not some top-secret internal tool.\n\n\u201cToo much data only, and this is kind of an oxymoron, predicts the past. And I want to be on top of it and predicting the future,\u201d he says. \u201cSo sometimes I want to be the one that creates the data versus looking at the data.\u201d\n\nInstead, Antony says he finds talent through agents, a more traditional talent-finding path, or through trusted creator recommendations. He met Waheed because another comedian, KingBach (17.8 million followers), passed his name along. Otherwise, Antony says he\u2019ll see creators \u201cpop\u201d in the data, which means he\u2019ll look at real-time engagement for creators using CrowdTangle, software that tracks online trends. He wants to see high engagement with their posts or that they\u2019re punching above their weight. He also pays attention to \u201cperformance indicators.\u201d The average engagement on a profile and its posts is 3 percent, he says, but Antony says a creator like Waheed gets seven times that amount. Meoww, the dancer, gets eight times that average.\n\nEngagement is everything. The fact that a creator\u2019s work showed up on Antony\u2019s own Instagram feed is enough. In one case, his Explore page surfaced Jay Brewer, a Steve Irwin-esque reptile trainer, and he tapped through to find a star in the making. \u201cMy thing that I like is old school: just looking at the app,\u201d Antony says. With how simple Antony makes this sound, you or I could be talent scouts, so long as we\u2019ve trained our Instagram algorithm just right and have that gut instinct.\n\nOther performance indicators include: some amount of following, mostly in the five-digit range, or the backing of a major network that guarantees some kind of exposure. The smallest creators he ever assisted were Olivia Rodrigo and Madison Hu from the Disney show Bizaardvark, who each had around 200 followers.\n\nWaheed tells me that after their first meeting, Antony sent him an Instagram \u201cbible\u201d that he follows very strictly\n\n\u201cDisney brought them in and said, \u2018These are going to be the next stars of Disney,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yeah, I can see that,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWe [thought], \u2018Let\u2019s help them out now, show them how to do Instagram right, so they don\u2019t have to worry about Instagram and can concentrate on their acting.\u2019 And now, one of them has passed a million [followers], and the other one has 800,000.\u201d\n\nOnce talent has been scouted, Antony invites them to the LA office for a meeting where he asks them about their aspirations, analyzes data (like their engagement and where their followers are based), looks for improvement areas (like posting around the platform more), and gives them \u201cbest practices\u201d (like \u201cbe authentic\u201d). Then, of course, the creators take some photos or make content in the in-house studio.\n\nKader shows me an example of what she demos for musicians in their meetings. She holds her finger down on a photo that she\u2019s going to post on Stories, and the whole screen turns one color. She then uses the eraser tool to preview what\u2019s behind the color wall, which artists could use to tease an album cover or collaboration. It\u2019s a neat party trick \u2014 if Instagram hacks impress you \u2014 but in some cases, creators don\u2019t need tricks. What they need to learn is how to make the platform work for them and amplify their message.\n\nWaheed tells me that after their first meeting, Antony sent him an Instagram \u201cbible\u201d that he follows very strictly. Waheed says his comedy videos were his top priority, but now he makes a point of posting photos to his feed, posting on Stories, going Live once a week, and experimenting with IGTV. (For now, his IGTV is mostly vertical cuts of his feed posts.) Even though it sounds like the bible just says to make more content, he credits Antony\u2019s advice with helping his account gain more than half a million followers in six months. He\u2019s adding around 100,000 per month now.\n\nCerny prefers sponsored content because she approves the brand deals herself and feels they match up with her values\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure [Antony] told me what he tells every other creative. I just applied every bit verbatim and stay consistent with it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou obviously see the results.\u201d\n\nIGTV launched 10 months ago, and it\u2019s yet to make a cultural dent. Meanwhile, TikTok, a short-form video app, has exploded in popularity over the last year, and YouTube has shown no sign of slowing down from its 1 billion hours per day of total watch time. For Instagram, making sure that creators are on the platform \u2014 and making things people actually want to watch \u2014 is critical to find success.\n\nWaheed says his view numbers are still low on IGTV, although he isn\u2019t taking full advantage of the platform yet. But another creator, actress Amanda Cerny (24.8 million followers), says she\u2019s grown her IGTV views to match those on her grid. She\u2019s averaging millions of viewers per video now and says she\u2019s transitioning away from her YouTube channel, even though she monetizes it.\n\n\u201cI never know who I\u2019m going to reach [on YouTube], when I\u2019m going to have ads, when I\u2019m not going to have ads,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not very transparent, and I don\u2019t really understand it fully. Even as one of their bigger creators on the platform, I\u2019m still trying to understand the platform.\u201d\n\nWhile she can\u2019t monetize her IGTV videos directly, Cerny says brands always look at her Instagram following first, and she can build sponsorship deals from that following. She prefers sponsored content because she approves the brand deals herself, and she feels they match up with her values. Brands haven\u2019t started asking for sponsored IGTV segments yet, but Cerny could see that happening one day. Her incentives are aligned with Instagram\u2019s: they both need IGTV to scale.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do, while we bridge to monetization, is not make talent go out of pocket.\u201d\n\nCerny thinks her videos succeed because of the variety of original content and comedy she posts. That\u2019s no accident. In addition to its white glove service, Antony and the creators team let certain creators expense the cost of their shoots. Cerny says she can send a budget with her needs for each video, and Instagram will cover the costs. For its part, Instagram says these expenses don\u2019t reach even the five-figure range, and it typically involves paying for a videographer, editor, or camera, which are essentials for creating content.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do, while we bridge to monetization, is not make talent go out of pocket,\u201d Antony says.\n\nIn addition to covering their expenses, Instagram has its own in-house studios and editors who can pitch in when needed. Dancer Meoww happened to be at Instagram on the day of my visit to take advantage of the studio space. She was producing an interview segment for news outlets abroad, and Facebook engineers manned the camera, read her the question prompts, and then later edited the footage for her to distribute. While it\u2019s not a direct money exchange, the expertise is something Meoww wouldn\u2019t have had access to without Antony taking her under his wing; she\u2019s a college student at UCLA who makes K-pop dance videos and found viral success.\n\nThe questions are what you\u2019d expect: When did you start dancing? What\u2019s your favorite K-pop group? The whole time, Antony beams like a proud father. When Meoww answers some questions in Mandarin, Antony chimes in to say he\u2019s been learning how to speak it, too. After all, he needs to speak the language of his talent.", "description": "For the launch of IGTV, Instagram isn\u2019t betting on an algorithm to discover talent to jump-start its long-form video competitor.
