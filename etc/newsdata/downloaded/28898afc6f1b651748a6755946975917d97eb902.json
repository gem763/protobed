While there are many reasons why it could have been delayed \u2013 both good and bad \u2013 it\u2019s much easier to envisage negative scenarios. Equity capital markets deals are usually pulled when there are fears about underlying demand, be it based on concerns of wall-crossed investors or seasoned ECM bankers fretting over market conditions.\n\nKaroon has since filed an updated presentation on its own website, titled \u201cKaroon Investor Review October 2019\u201d and authored by the company\u2019s corporate finance manager Al Gordon, to cover up what appears to be a monumental own goal.\n\nThe question fast money hedge funds are now asking is when will Karoon come to market \u2013 and how to trade around it? According to Karoon\u2019s comprehensive October update, the deal is due to complete early in the new year and will be backdated to January 1, 2019.\n\nKaroon said the $US665 million headline price would be reduced by $US150 million to $US180 million to account for 2019 production, while it had already paid a $US49.9 million deposit. It leaves about $U450 million to be paid \u2013 and $US250 million of that is already committed by Dutch bank ING as senior debt funding, with potential for more. Assuming Karoon will not want to drain all of its $US178 million in the bank, fundies expect about an equity raising worth more $200 million or more.", "description": "It\u2019s 2\u00bd months since Karoon Energy and its bankers warmed up fund managers for an equity raising.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/beb95377cf36ef60a74063d7a4057e544d293b62", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
