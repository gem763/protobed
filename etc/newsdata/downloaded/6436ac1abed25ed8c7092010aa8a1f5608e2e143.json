Boeing has begun taking steps to increase safety oversight in its industrial operations and at the board level, he added.\n\nBoeing plans to cut 787 production, delayed a planned rise in 737 production and the entry into service of the 777X twin-aisle \u2013 a trio of industrial setbacks broadening pressure on the company\u2019s new commercial leadership.\n\nBoeing named veteran executive Stan Deal, who had been running its two-year-old Global Services Division, to the top job at commercial airplanes. Deal\u2019s challenge to get the MAX back into service globally while simultaneously handling new aircraft deliveries and boosting 737 production is seen as one of the most formidable logistical challenges in the industry\u2019s history.\n\nBoeing said it was delaying plans to step up production on its 737 line in the Seattle-area through 2019, and would not hit a record-level 57 aircraft monthly until late 2020, months later than previously planned.\n\nCiting global trade tensions, it was also reducing the 787 production rate to 12 airplanes per month for approximately two years beginning in late 2020.\n\nIts forthcoming 777X twin-aisle, facing engine issues at General Electric, was progressing through pre-flight testing and remains on track for first flight in early 2020, but the company was now targeting early 2021 for the first delivery of the 777X.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "Ousts top executive of its crucial airplanes division, Kevin McAllister", "authors": ["Ankit Ajmera", "Eric M.
