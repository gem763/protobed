Anyone else? I'm a comic, and it's our job to name the elephant in the room. Do we know what that is?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt's a Freddy Krueger in the room if you will.\n\n\u201cI didn't know we had to bring our own mace and rape whistles.\u201d\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nSeveral men in the audience can be heard booing before one told her to \u201cshut up\u201d.\n\n\u201cOh, shut up?' Bachman replied with her mic still in hand.\n\n\u201cThis kills at group therapy for rape survivors.\u201d\n\nAs others in the audience leapt to her defence, she added: \u201cI have been raped. Surprisingly by no one in this room!

A spokesman for Weinstein later said of the incident that is \u201cwas uncalled for, downright rude and an example of how due process today is being squashed by the public, trying to take it away in the courtroom too.\u201d\n\nHe currently faces criminal charges of predatory sexual assault, criminal sexual act, first-degree rape and third-degree rape, to which he has pleaded not guilty.\n\n\n\nWeinstein maintains that all sexual encounters he's been involved in have been consensual.\n\nThe trial is expected to begin in January.", "description": "The disgraced movie mogul was confronted by comedian Kelly Bachman after she saw him in the audience", "authors": ["Christopher Bucktin", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Zoe Stuckless", "Kelly Bachman"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20723785.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILES-US-ENTERTAINMENT-FILM-ASSAULT-POLICE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
