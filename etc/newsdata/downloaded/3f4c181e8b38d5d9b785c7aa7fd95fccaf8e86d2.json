(Image: Disney Parks)\n\nThat\u2019s no moon. It\u2019s the ruins of a space station on a moon.\n\nWe learn so much about the galaxy far, far away through ancillary means these days, whether it\u2019s tie-in media designed to fill in the gaps throughout the saga, or the sheer volume of product a brand like Star Wars is associated with just letting little tidbits and factoids eke out on everything from action figures to cereal boxes, from cardboard cutouts to, err, Monopoly boards. Now you can add \u201cDisneyland park rides\u201d to the list of avenues where we can learn new details about The Rise of Skywalker.\n\nBut did you need to, really, in a post-Galaxy\u2019s Edge reality? Probably not. Add it just to be sure!\n\nDisney just confirmed that the beloved Tomorrowland ride Star Tours, as it has been for previous new entries to the Star Wars saga, will be receiving updates this December to include new travel sequences inspired by the upcoming Rise of Skywalker. Previous expansions to the ride have sent tourists to Crait, Jakku, and even Batuu, which is technically literally just across the park from Star Tours.\n\nBut anyway, starting in December, Star Tours will add a new location from Episode IX to its randomised schedule: the oceanic moon of Kef Bir.\n\nHope you\u2019ve got Dramamine stocked up. (Image: Disney)\n\nThat name isn\u2019t familiar, but the location itself is; this is the world we have seen glimpsed throughout the footage released of Rise of Skywalker that is littered with the wreckage of the Death Star II, making Kef Bir a very interesting location indeed. While it\u2019s unconfirmed, Kef Bir also seems to be where Naomi Ackie\u2019s new character, Jannah, is from \u2014 it\u2019s where most of the footage of her character so far has been connected to.\n\nAt least now, we have a name to put to that mystery. And can rest easy that one day we may be able to visit it through the medium of Star Tours, I guess.\n\nKef Bir comes to Star Tours at Disneyland, Disney World, Disneyland Paris and Tokyo Disney starting December 20, 2019.", "description": "That\u2019s no moon.
