Authorities in the Netherlands are considering overhauling the way sex work in the country operates\n\nThose without permits would be breaking the law - including clients who make use of illegal prostitution.\n\nPimping, transporting and acting as a body guard to sex workers who don't have a permit will also be illegal.\n\nAround 7,000 people work in the paid-sex sector in Amsterdam alone where the country's best-known red light area is situated.\n\nAbout 75 per cent of its sex workers come from low-income countries, particularly eastern Europe, according to official figures.\n\nIn the Netherlands, sex workers have to register with the local chamber of commerce and pay income tax.\n\nBut Dutch authorities have become increasingly concerned about the spread of the industry, particularly with the advent of social media and the internet, which some sex workers use to canvas clients.\n\nAround 7,000 people work in the paid-sex sector in Amsterdam alone (above the city's Red Light district) where the country's best-known red light area is based\n\n'Currently there is not enough oversight of non-licensed companies, the escort industry and independently operating prostitutes, which means abuses can happen,' the government said.\n\nSome 12 to 18 municipalities will be able to hand out permits, with each one documented in a national register.\n\nSex workers themselves will not be bound to specific areas once issued with a permit.\n\nAmsterdam's first female mayor launched plans to overhaul the city's Red Light district and its window displays, in a bid to protect sex workers from gawping tourists.\n\nFemke Halsema has attempted to overhaul the sex work trade and wants to move prostitutes out of the neighbourhood.\n\nAmsterdam's first female mayor launched plans to overhaul the city's Red Light district (above) and its window displays that could see them all moved out of the neighbourhood\n\nBut in July, prostitutes in Amsterdam's infamous Red Light district demanded more windows from which to ply their trade in their fight back against the reforms.\n\nThe area is one of the biggest tourist draws in a city that attracted around 18 million visitors last year.\n\nBut rising crime and the sheer number of visitors have contributed to huge problems in the area, once called a 'square kilometre of misery' by police.\n\nOne option was to move some window booths to other areas of the city, while the more radical move would be to close down and move all of them.\n\nHowever, another consideration is to actually increase the number of window brothels in the red light district from the current level of 330, and possibly also create a 'sex hotel', on the grounds that it will help sex workers trapped in the unlicensed sector to move to the licensed industry.", "description": "The Dutch government is planning to introduce reforms to the way sex workers operate in the country.
