Which is nice, because if two black holes crashed into each other near our planet, humanity would probably be wiped out.\n\nA gravity wave takes place within the atmosphere of a planet, rather than out in deep space.\n\nThey are waves generated within a fluid after it is disturbed in some way. As the fluid settles back into equilibrium under the force of gravity, it will sometimes move back and forth. This oscillation generates a wave.\n\nGravity waves can also be generated near the \u2018interface\u2019 between water and air, so can be found on the surface of seas as well as high up in the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey are normally invisible but can be seen in the sky when cloud forms along a wave\u2019s edge.\n\nAtmospheric gravity waves over the Coral Sea this morning. pic.twitter.com/hVKTbw12Z0 \u2014 Andrew Miskelly (@andrewmiskelly) October 9, 2019\n\nMore atmospheric gravity waves. Triggered, in this case, by outflow from isolated thunderstorms over eastern NSW this afternoon. pic.twitter.com/tE5OQDouHB \u2014 Andrew Miskelly (@andrewmiskelly) October 24, 2019\n\nThe phenomenon was demonstrated in a tweet written by Andrew Miskelly, a developer at an Australian meteorological company called Weather Zone.\n\nHe wrote: \u2018Waves cause the air to rise and sink, cooling and warming its water vapour and making upper water vapour temperature an effective means of visualisation.\n\n\u2018In some cases, cloud forms on the crests.\u2019\n\nMiskelly shared several stunning illustrations of the waves, including a view of waves shooting from a thunderstorm.\n\n\u2018There was a big thunderstorm over the north-west of Western Australia and the disturbance, in this case, was the cold air falling out of the thunderstorm and into the warmer air near the surface,\u2019 Adam Morgan of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology told the ABC.\n\n\u2018The difference in density there causes the disturbance and then the gravity wave can travel out as the cold air spreads out. The disturbance will exist until everything rebalances itself, that\u2019s why they can travel a long way.\u2019", "description": "Gravitational waves are ripples in space-time produced by the collision of two black holes or dramatic events such as a supernova explosion.
