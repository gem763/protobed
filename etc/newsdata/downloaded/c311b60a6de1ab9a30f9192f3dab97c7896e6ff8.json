Maybe it was a bit too early to go, but I felt good,\u201d Kuss told reporters.\n\n\u201cI knew that the first few kilometers of the climb were the hardest so I tried to be in a good position and wanted to ride at my own rhythm. There were no mind games.\u201d\n\nValverde launched an attack on Roglic shortly afterwards in a bid to reduce his overall deficit although the Slovenian was up for the fight and the pair stayed together to come eighth and ninth respectively, two minutes 14 seconds down on Kuss.\n\nValverde still trails Roglic by two minutes 25 seconds but the Vuelta now looks set to be a two-horse race after the pair caused considerable damage to the other contenders.\n\n2016 winner Nairo Quintana suffered the most, finishing three minutes 50 seconds behind Kuss and now trails Roglic by five minutes nine seconds.\n\nHis compatriot Miguel Angel Lopez also saw his hopes of an overall win fade as he lost 41 seconds on Roglic.\n\nLopez came over the finish line at the same time as Tadej Pogacar, who remains third overall but fell three minutes 42 seconds behind Roglic and lost 40 seconds to Valverde.\n\n\u201cMy legs were feeling good so I decided to attack from afar and I have to say thanks to Roglic and to (Movistar team mate) Marc Soler for working so hard,\u201d Valverde said.\n\n\u201cAfter all that hard work it would have been very bad if I hadn\u2019t gained anything but 40 seconds is a very good amount.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s stage is a 144.4 km ride from Pravia to Alto de La Cubilla. Lena, another punishing mountain stage before Tuesday\u2019s rest day. The race concludes next Sunday in Madrid.", "description": "Primoz Roglic maintained his sizeable lead over Alejandro Valverde in the Vuelta a Espana after stage 15 on Sunday but both widened the gap over the rest of their rivals in the general classification.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
