Fans are seen wearing LeBron James jerseys with an NBA logo covered by a Chinese national flag stickers during the game. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nDaryl Morey, general manager of another team, the Houston Rockets, voiced support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in a tweet last week, prompting Chinese sponsors and partners to cut ties with the NBA.\n\nChina is estimated to be worth more than $4 billion for the NBA, so the stakes are high.\n\nOutside the arena on Saturday, some protesters waved Chinese flags and others held admonitory red signs. \u201cMorey must apologize to China,\u201d read one. Another said: \u201cViolations of national sovereignty will not be tolerated\u201d.\n\nChina has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong, where large and at times violent anti-government protesters have gained momentum over the past four months.\n\nState media characterized Morey\u2019s tweet - which read \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong\u201d - as meddling in China\u2019s affairs. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver defended it on Tuesday, further angering Beijing.\n\nA 20-year-old Chinese university student at Saturday\u2019s game, who would only give his English name, Andy, was unfazed by the controversy and blamed foreign media for stirring things up.\n\n\u201cSport is a pure thing and I\u2019m not going to stop going because Morey spoke about things he doesn\u2019t understand,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the NBA became harmful to China\u2019s interests, we would reject it. But this wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal if you foreign media would shut up about it.\u201d\n\nThe protests in the former British colony began in opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy.\n\nHong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula guaranteeing it wide-ranging autonomy.\n\nOne man with a sign in Chinese saying \u201cNBA get out of China\u201d had it ripped up by police.\n\n\u201cTake care of your safety and belongings, please don\u2019t display any banners or signs inside,\u201d organizers broadcast as people entered.\n\nAs game time approached, Phoebe, a 22-year-old chemistry student in a Lakers jersey, said she would not have come if she didn\u2019t already have a ticket. \u201cThe U.S. needs to understand it can\u2019t meddle in other country\u2019s politics. If the NBA does this again I\u2019d rather it would leave the country.\u201d\n\nJin, a 26-year-old property manager who came across the border from Hong Kong with a friend to attend the game, felt a bit nervous. Asked if he had considered not coming because of the controversy, he paused as police strolled by.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s the Lakers and the Nets, they\u2019ve got strong lineups this year, so...\u201d", "description": "Thousands of Chinese basketball fans cheered on the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets at an NBA exhibition game in the city of Shenzhen on Saturday night - but some warned the organization to stay out of politics.", "authors": ["David Kirton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440090749&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0GP", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
