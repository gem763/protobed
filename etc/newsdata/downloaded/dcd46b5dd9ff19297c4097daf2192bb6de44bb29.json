He matched the rookie mark set by Mark McGwire for Oakland in 1987.\n\nJeff McNeil also went deep for the Mets, who set a franchise record with 225 home runs this season.\n\nTrailing 4-3 going into the ninth, the Mets tied it on Brandon Nimmo\u2019s third hit, an RBI single off Jairo Diaz (5-4). After a walk to McNeil loaded the bases, Joe Harvey relieved and walked Alonso on four pitches to put New York ahead.\n\nAnother run scored on a double-play grounder and Seth Lugo (7-4) hit an RBI single in his first plate appearance of the season.\n\nRookie Sam Hilliard hit two home runs for the Rockies, connecting both times off Noah Syndergaard. Hilliard\u2019s first homer went an estimated 447 feet to right-center and his second drive gave the Rockies a 2-1 lead. Hilliard was recalled on Aug. 27 and homered in his debut that night.\n\nSyndergaard went 5 2/3 innings, giving up four runs on 10 hits and striking out six. Ren\u00e9 Rivera started at catcher - Syndergaard recently expressed his interest in pitching to someone other than regular starter Wilson Ramos.\n\nRamos pinch-hit for Rivera and drew a leadoff walk in the ninth to begin the Mets\u2019 rally.\n\nMcNeil hit his 22nd homer, tagging Jeff Hoffman in the first inning. Hoffman allowed two runs on five hits in 5 1/3 innings.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMets: RHP Robert Gsellman (right triceps tightness) will throw off the mound again, manager Mickey Callaway said. Gsellman was scheduled to play catch Wednesday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMets: RHP Jacob deGrom (9-8, 2.61) will open a three-game series at Cincinnati on Friday night. He is 2-1 with a 1.74 ERA in five career starts against the Reds.\n\nRockies: RHP Peter Lambert (3-6, 6.98) goes for his second straight win at the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday night. Lambert had gone without a victory in 15 straight starts before beating San Diego on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Pete Alonso hit his major league-leading 49th homer to tie the record for most by a rookie, then drew a bases-loaded walk during a four-run rally in the ninth inning that sent the New York Mets over the Colorado Rockies 7-4 Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Kelly"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/mets_rockies_baseball_91439_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
