According to his subsequent police report, which was passed on to the Maryland state attorney, SK \u201ccried during their meeting and was upset that the video was going around the school\u201d.\n\nProsecutors subsequently charged SK as a juvenile with filming a minor engaging in a sex act, distributing child pornography and showing an obscene item to a minor.\n\nShe appealed, arguing that \u201cthe statute was intended to protect, not prosecute, minors victimised and exploited in the production of sexually explicit videos\u201d.\n\nThe Maryland Court of Appeals recognised the issue was more complicated than in equivalent cases involving adults while still ruling against SK.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, there is no question that the state has an overwhelming interest in preventing the spread of child pornography and has been given broad authority to eradicate the production and distribution of child pornography,\u201d the judge\u2019s opinion on Wednesday concluded.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, SK, albeit unwisely, engaged in the same behaviour as many of her peers. Here, SK is prosecuted as a \u2018child pornographer\u2019 for sexting and, because she is a minor, her actions fell directly within the scope of the statute\u2026 As written, the statute in its plain meaning is all encompassing, making no distinction whether a minor or an adult is distributing the matter.\u201d\n\nThe judges said they did \u201crecognise that there may be compelling policy reasons for treating teenage sexting different from child pornography\u201d and said legislation differentiating the two \u201cought to be considered by [the state\u2019s] general assembly in the future\u201d.\n\nJudge Michele D Hotten, the one descenting voice on the panel, wrote: \u201cShe made a video depicting consensual sexual conduct... The general assembly did not seek to subject minors who recorded themselves in non-exploitative sexual encounters to prosecution. Rather, the statute contemplates protecting children from the actions of others.\u201d\n\nMaryland\u2019s verdict has sparked widespread criticism for subjecting SK to a humiliating ordeal.\n\nRebecca Roiphe, a professor of law at New York Law School and former Manhattan assistant district attorney, told The Guardian: \u201cThis is a ridiculous reading of the statute... The law uses two different terms, \u2018person\u2019 to describe the perpetrator and \u2018minor\u2019 to describe the victim. The legislature clearly did not intend to criminalise the victim.\n\n\u201cI think the case illustrates how troubling the enforcement of sex crimes can be and how important it is that prosecutors use their discretion wisely.\u201d", "description": "A teenage girl who sent a video of herself performing a sexually explicit act to two friends has been charged with\u00a0violating state child pornography laws by the Maryland Court of Appeals\u00a0this week.", "authors": ["Joe Sommerlad"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/09/01/10/phone.jpg"}
