The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity. What is the evidence on rising temperatures? The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. What other effects do carbon emissions have? Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth. So is climate change making everything dryer? Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. What do recent weather patterns show? The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.

He said his job was to ensure emergency services \u201care given the tools and resources they need, [and] they have the science to understand that these events could become more severe\u201d.\n\nAsked by Guardian Australia why he had stepped around the human contribution to climate change given expert scientific advice on the increased frequency of really bad fire days, Littleproud\u2019s office supplied a written answer attributable to the minister: \u201cI don\u2019t know if climate change is man-made.\u201d\n\nLater on Tuesday, Littleproud told Sky News in response to a question from the network\u2019s political editor, David Speers, about whether manmade climate change was real: \u201cI am going to be honest with you \u2013 I don\u2019t have an opinion.\u201d\n\nBut Littleproud launched a complete about-face in parliament on Thursday, saying: \u201cI accept the science on manmade impact on climate change. Always have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI accept the science. I\u2019m just a poor humble bloke with a year 12 education but I\u2019m prepared to accept, prepared to accept what our scientists are telling us \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nIn defence of his position, Littleproud pointed to his positive record on climate change, which included driving a climate adaptation response in the agriculture portfolio.\n\nIn an interview with Guardian Australia last June, Littleproud said the climate was changing and the transition in the energy market \u2013 with renewables displacing traditional generation sources \u2013 was \u201cexciting, not only for the environment but for the hip pocket\u201d.\n\nThe Queensland National said then the climate had been changing \u201csince we first tilled the soil in Australia\u201d and he did not care whether the change was due to human activity or not. \u201cI\u2019m not losing any sleep on that, whether you want to prove it is manmade or not \u2013 I want to be pragmatic.\u201d", "description": "David Littleproud\u2019s comments to parliament entirely at odds with earlier statement to Guardian Australia", "authors": ["Katharine Murphy", "Paul Karp"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db0f9143386fd45a37f83a1f1767d1e271aaa6db/0_89_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=372e884406e99f0621c2e404f4712f3f", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
