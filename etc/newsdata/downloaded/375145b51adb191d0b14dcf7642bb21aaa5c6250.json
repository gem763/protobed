Apple\u2019s latest 13-inch MacBook Pro is currently $1,199, $100 off of its normal $1,299 price, on Amazon. This is the first price drop on the 2019 version, which has the Touch Bar by default as well as a True Tone display that can adjust the screen\u2019s backlight to match the ambient lighting in the room. It also comes standard with an Intel Core i5 quad-core processor, so it\u2019s more powerful than the MacBook Air, in case you were deciding between the two.\n\nIf you are a student, the parent of a student, or school faculty, I recommend purchasing through Apple instead. You\u2019ll get the same deal, plus Apple is throwing in a set of Beats headphones as part of its back-to-school promotion.\n\nToday is the last day that Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can get game vouchers. These vouchers come in packs of two for $99.99, saving you $20 after you redeem them both. The selection of Nintendo Switch titles looped into the promotion is impressive, so it\u2019s worth taking advantage of this deal if you plan to pick up a few games.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber, you can easily sign up for the service in the eShop on your Switch or through a digital key provided when you purchase through Amazon. Buying the vouchers today will give you a year to use them, so if nothing strikes your fancy right now, you have up to next July. For example, by that time, Animal Crossing: New Horizons will be available, if that\u2019s a game you\u2019re interested in.\n\nSpeaking of Nintendo Switch, Woot is selling the console for $274.99, which is $25 off of its original price. It\u2019s a small discount, but these are new consoles, so it\u2019s worth checking this out if you\u2019re in the market for one. Compared to the Nintendo Switch Lite, which recently entered its preorder phase, this model can connect to your TV so you can enjoy some couch-side gaming.\n\nHere are a couple of other deals that you should know about:", "description": "You can get the student discount on the latest MacBook Pro without actually being a student, saving you $100 off of the $1,299 price. Also, it\u2019s the final day that Nintendo is letting Switch Online subscribers buy game vouchers.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6kg32KKoRVrrciXkkjILrfjEpL4=/0x191:2040x1259/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18311687/akrales_190711_3536_0158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-31"}
