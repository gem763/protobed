This is the most confident I've felt about my body in a long time.\n\n\"I know I said I wouldn't have more surgery, but I thought to myself, 'Do I actually give a s**t what people think?'

I said ,'Go on then, get it in there! Why not?'\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images for Nickelodeon Sli)\n\nDanielle went on to say that despite her hard work in the gym, she's always had \"a flat a**e\", but now she loves her look.\n\nLately, Danielle, who used to be married to footballer Jamie O'Hara has become swept up in the war between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy.\n\nColeen accused Rebekah of selling stories on her, and she vehemently denies it.\n\nDanielle told Mirror Online she had to speak out because the same thing has happened to her.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
