Earlier this month, a woman in Virginia gave birth in her bathtub hours after she says she was turned away from a hospital there. Similar stories have played out elsewhere in the U.S. and the U.K. as well.\n\nPHOTO: Quayla Harris's son, Enmitt, was delivered in the car after Harris and her husband were sent home. (Quayla Harris) More\n\nWhile there are no statistics as to how often and how many women are sent home from the hospital in the early stages of labor, the issue appears to be front of mind for many. Numerous online message boards offer tips for women to avoid being sent home and online articles share advice for those who have been.\n\nABC News' Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Jennifer Ashton, who has delivered more than 1,500 babies, said that \"obstetric management of early labor and active labor is both a science as well as an art.\"\n\nDoctors consider numerous factors, including if it's a woman's first labor, if the pregnancy is high-risk and whether fetal heartbeat patterns are reassuring, as well as how far away the patient lives, according to Ashton.\n\n\u201cIf you think of labor and delivery as an ICU for pregnant women with continuous monitoring and often 1-to-1 nursing, it\u2019s easy to understand how sometimes there are not free beds to admit women who don\u2019t yet meet the above criteria.\u201d said Ashton.\u201cTo be clear, it\u2019s never ideal to send a women home and have her deliver outside of the hospital.\u201d\n\nSome research also indicates that there are benefits to delaying admission to labor and delivery wards, including fewer medical interventions as well as better outcomes.\n\nWomen who spoke to ABC News regarding the difficulties in their labor experience said they understood the procedures in place when it comes to admitting pregnant women and each had known that not being admitted because of early labor was a possibility. However, they felt they weren't being heard when it came to their own feelings.\n\n\u201cSometimes it's not about policy and procedures,\" Harris said. \"It's about doing what's right. Women know their bodies ... Why are we being dismissed?\"\n\n'See you next week'\n\nHarris, 30, said she was sent home from a Dallas hospital after a doctor told her she was \u201crushing things\u201d because she wasn\u2019t 4 cm dilated, she told ABC News. She was 40 weeks along at the time.\n\nA number of factors come into play as to whether a hospital admits a woman in labor, depending on risk and other parameters. Among them is whether the woman is in active labor, which is gauged by cervical dilation. Guidelines changed in 2014 from 4 cm to 6 cm dilation to help avoid unnecessary C-sections.\n\n\u201cHe said it could be another week and we were just kind of looking confused. I\u2019m like \u2018OK. No, this is not another week,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nHer contractions were consistently 5 minutes apart, had reached a point of being unbearable, and the nurse said she her cervix was 95% effaced, according to Harris -- all indicators of how far along labor is.\n\n(MORE: Couple delivers baby in bathtub after being sent home from hospital)\n\n\u201cI have two other children,\" she remembered thinking that day, July 1, 2017. \"I think I know when my body is ready.\"\n\nEven so, she still left the hospital -- a decision she now regrets.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Quayla Harris knew exactly how she wanted the delivery of her third child to go: a natural birth in the hospital with her husband by her side.
