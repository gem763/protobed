Driving the challenge for CBP were high levels of families and unaccompanied children who require extra care when taken into U.S. custody.\n\nBorder agents stopped 608,697 unauthorized family members and unaccompanied children attempting to cross during budget year 2019, according to newly released CBP data. That\u2019s up from about 218,000 in the previous year. The numbers reflect the highest surge of parents and minors ever recorded, Morgan said.\n\nIn total, nearly one million unauthorized migrants were stopped at the border in the last budget year, according to CBP data.\n\nJose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters, FILE\n\n\u201cThese are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nThe commissioner first announced the latest border crossing totals at a White House briefing in early October, also noting a 65 percent decline in unauthorized migrants encountered by border agents over the past 4 months.\n\n\u201cThis administration\u2019s strategies have brought about dramatic results,\u201d he said Tuesday.\n\nThe Trump administration has implemented new policies to limit asylum claims, including a program called \"Migrant Protection Protocols\" that sends migrants back to Mexico while they attempt to navigate the U.S. legal process. The practice has faced legal challenges but was allowed to continue until a higher court rules. The 9th Circuit Court of appeals is currently reviewing the legality of MPP.\n\nPointing out the dangers posed by making illegal crossings in remote areas, immigration authorities publicly encourage those seeking entry to cross at official U.S. crossings. However, port officials have resorted to limiting access for asylum seekers and other non-authorized crossers.\n\nThe process, known as \u201cmetering,\u201d dates back to 2016 and has likely resulted in additional illegal crossings, according to the Congressional Research Service.", "description": "Despite record increases of migrants stopped by federal authorities along the southern United States border, tens of thousands more have evaded capture.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/mark-morgan-01-kdbc-jef-191030_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
