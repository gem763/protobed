The Trump administration has refused to comply with a House impeachment inquiry. A second whistleblower complaint has surfaced. And now, a federal judge has ordered Trump to release eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns.\n\nWith the multiple scandals surrounding the embattled Trump presidency, you would assume interest in impeachment is higher than ever.\n\nHowever, a first glance at some simple data suggests otherwise.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nPeople are googling \u201cimpeachment\u201d and \u201cimpeach Trump\u201d less than they were a week ago, and even less than the week before that.\n\nThis graph shows Google data for the last 30 days for such key terms:\n\nThis sharp decline looks like excellent news for the president: a barrage of negative press yet people are losing interest in impeachment! A more nuanced look, however, shows there is much more to these online trends than meets the eye.\n\nAs someone whose job it is to monitor trends like this, I often find that people\u2019s interest in news is not as simple as these graphs make out. Whereas in the past I\u2019ve noticed people frequently searching \u201chow could Trump be impeached\u201d or \u201cwhat would happen\u201d or even \u201cwhat is impeachment\u201d, the searches are becoming increasingly sophisticated. More people \u2013 particularly American searchers \u2013 are becoming well-versed in the intricate details of this rapidly developing story. Searches for people\u2019s names spike as news breaks, as do specific legal and political terms, suggesting people are following the story extremely closely. Their increased interest is the actual reason why they look, on first glance, like they\u2019re less engaged with impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe most recent Washington Post-Schar Scool Poll shows 58 per cent of US adults support impeachment and a plurality (49 per cent) support Trump\u2019s removal. Most damning for Republicans who hope this will all go away, independent voters support impeachment and removal by similar margins, at 57 per cent and 49 per cent respectively. The Trump administration may hope that declining search traffic on impeachment is proof that voters don\u2019t care about the story, but a more likely explanation is that Democrats have successfully made their case.\n\nIt is important to remember that when looking at a snapshot of data it is just that: a snapshot. Whether it\u2019s impeachment, tax returns, or the interest in Democratic candidates which peaks round debates, just looking at the words people are searching is not enough. Look deeper and you may see a different story.\n\nYours,\n\nLucy Anna Gray\n\nAssistant Audience Editor (US)", "description": "A whistleblower\u2019s account of US president Donald Trump exhorting a foreign power to investigate a political rival has been corroborated.\u00a0The Trump administration has refused to comply with a House impeachment inquiry.\u00a0A second whistleblower complaint has surfaced.
