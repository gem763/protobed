It has been a legacy title and from its introduction and within the first decade of its lifespan, set the benchmark for lifestyle magazine programming.\n\n\"Through it, the SABC pioneered entertainment television in South Africa in the early stages of our democracy and consciously put a different face and perspective to the South African narrative and perception,\" said Mr David Makubyane, Acting Group Executive: Television.\n\nMs Basetsana Kumalo, producer and co-owner of Tswelopele Productions with Ms Patience Stevens said: \"This show exemplifies excellence and sophistication in arts, design, d\u00e9cor, fashion and broadcasting, creating countless jobs and building careers in its many years on air.\n\n\"It has been quite a ride, and it is fitting that after 25 years we salute this season as our final one. We've enjoyed many accolades with Top Billing - including a SAFTA award in the Best Magazine Show category. We trust the show has served audiences by inspiring them to dream big, embrace their inner creative genius, and dare to live the life they deserve.\"\n\nEvery show has a beginning and an end and reaching a quarter of a century for any production is one great feat. Thank you South Africa for allowing us in your homes for 25 years. Sending the love right back. \u2665???\u2665???\n\n\n\nJoin me & my family for the last episode on Saturday at 6pm. \u2014 Basetsana Kumalo (@basetsanakumalo) October 17, 2019\n\nRepeats of special episodes will run on SABC 3 until March 2020.\n\nREAD MORE: 5 extravagant celebrity weddings on 'Top Billing' we'll never forget", "description": "The SABC has released an official statement on the cancellation of the long-running lifestyle show 'Top Billing'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9476/fc511dd11747426ca11ae2d07b99f84e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
