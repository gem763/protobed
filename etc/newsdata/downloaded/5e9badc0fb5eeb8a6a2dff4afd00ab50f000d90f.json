Let\u2019s Investigate.", "language": "en", "text": "The prize is glory (and also living). Photo: Jessica Miglio/CTMG\n\nFor the past several years, it seems as though we\u2019ve been blessed with a consistent stream of pretty good and pretty somber zombie movies. But this fall, following an early automaton release (Jordan Peele\u2019s Us, in March), we\u2019re getting an absolute deluge of zombie comedy movies in the form of a raucous undead triple feature. Zombieland: Double Tap is about to hit theaters, and it follows the arrival of the zom-comedies Little Monsters and One Cut of the Dead. Double Tap, of course, takes us back into \u201cZ-Land\u201d a decade after we first met our motley crew of heroes including Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg, and Abigail Breslin. Meanwhile, Little Monsters and One Cut of the Dead provide international takes on the genre: The former is an Australian horror romp, starring Josh Gad and Lupita Nyong\u2019o, which takes us into a small-scale zombie outbreak at a children\u2019s amusement park; the latter is a low-budget meta-take on the undead genre out of Japan.\n\nThis zom-com onslaught got us wondering. Who, among all these zombie slayers, would reign supreme in a Hunger Games\u2013style battle among its lead characters? Imagine it: a big battle dome filled with zombies, where our protagonists and their sidekicks must not only fight off the walking dead but best one another. The prize is glory (and also living). Vulture has critically evaluated each of the stars in these three new movies to determine the survivor supreme. Let them fight!\n\nBerkeley: Ava Jogia plays Berkeley in Zombieland: Double Tap, and since he\u2019s a committed pacifist, he is absolutely dying first in the zombie Hunger Games. He is very handsome and has great hair, but this ride is going to be very short for Berkeley.\n\nKo: A heartthrob who fancies himself a very serious actor, Ko (Kazuaki Nagaya) is trying to bring some gravitas to his role in One Cut of the Dead\u2019s movie within a movie. But he can barely handle his director\u2019s biting feedback, let alone a pack of literal flesh-munching corpses. He might be able to panic his way to survival for a spell, but Ko is ultimately a threat to no one.\n\nChinatsu: Chinatsu (Yuzuki Akiyama) is the well-meaning lead actress in One Cut of the Dead\u2019s zombie movie that gets overrun by actual zombies. She has a hard time summoning the fortitude to convincingly cry in front of a camera, but over the course of the chaos, she experiences a, well, emotional breakthrough. But her tactic of running and screaming in the face of danger will go only so far before a more capable killer cuts Chinatsu down. Sorry, girl. You don\u2019t have what it takes.\n\nThere\u2019s no way Columbus is getting out of this alive. Photo: Columbia Pictures\n\nColumbus: In the Zombieland movies, we\u2019re meant to believe Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s Columbus would survive a decade in the undead wasteland, when every piece of good sense tells us that, on his own, he wouldn\u2019t last long enough to write his 70-something rule book come the apocalypse. Columbus makes it to Zombieland: Double Tap because he has his little zombie-fighting family to protect him. In a brawl-for-all, Columbus\u2019s limitless neuroses would amount to a quick death.\n\nDave: He rises to the challenge in Little Monsters, but it\u2019s mostly because he\u2019s angling to impress his little nephew\u2019s teacher, Miss Caroline (Lupita Nyong\u2019o). In the event of a zombie Hunger Games, however, alliances would only be temporary and opportunistic. On his own in a battle dome, Dave is likely just some guy surrounded by flesh-eating zombies that he\u2019s not equipped to handle. He\u2019s got some fight in him, so he\u2019s not going down first, but don\u2019t expect Dave to make it far past the first batch of deaths.\n\nLittle Rock: Abigail Breslin\u2019s Little Rock is a weaker link in the Zombieland crew, but she\u2019s also a hard-ass. This girl wants to survive. While she would be outmatched in most hand-to-hand combat scenarios, she could rely on her cunning \u2014 setting traps and not having any qualms about shooting someone in the back \u2014 to take out a few challengers. Little Rock wouldn\u2019t fight fair, but she\u2019d put up a good fight in her own way.\n\nMadison: This one defies reason, but Zoey Deutch\u2019s Madison, whom we meet in Double Tap, would definitely be able to accident her way into surviving half of the zombie Hunger Games. She spent years hiding in a fridge in the Zombieland world and didn\u2019t crack, so we have strong reason to believe she\u2019d end up in the only isolated part of this battle zone and not be seen again until a more skilled hunter came looking for her.\n\nTeddy McGiggle, correctly stepping back to let Miss Caroline shine.

If he snaps into megalomaniac mode, as he does in One Cut, Higurashi has the stuff to turn cold-blooded killer. He is polite and accommodating by nature, but never underestimate the quiet rage of a repressed man!\n\nWichita: Besides Tallahassee, Emma Stone\u2019s Wichita is the only one of the Zombieland found family who could really make a survival run on her own. Maybe that\u2019s just Stone\u2019s smoky voice and leather jacket tricking us into thinking she\u2019s a top-shelf soldier of the apocalypse, but if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s a damn convincing trick! Wichita\u2019s cool head will prevail as the pressure ratchets up, and while her killer instinct isn\u2019t quite intense enough to propel her to victory here, she would make a damn good run at it.\n\nMao: One Cut of the Dead\u2019s Mao (Mao) is a sneaky contender, but watch out for her. An aspiring filmmaker, Mao is a demanding perfectionist even if she\u2019s just working on her dad\u2019s shitty low-budget zombie movie. She\u2019s confident, seizes control in chaos, and really seems as if she\u2019s just waiting for the right challenge to push her to greatness.\n\nTeddy McGiggle: Here\u2019s the thing about Josh Gad\u2019s Teddy McGiggle in Little Monsters: He is a depraved, terrible man willing to throw children to zombies to save his own skin. He\u2019s a drunk. He\u2019s a nihilist, and he makes his money manipulating kids into thinking he\u2019s a kindly entertainer, when he\u2019s actually just trying to have sex with their sad single moms. Teddy won\u2019t make it to the end of the war, but he will go to savage lengths to save himself.\n\nTallahassee: Woody Harrelson\u2019s Tallahassee was practically built for the zombie wars. He loves wasting them almost as much as he loves Twinkies, and he\u2019s well-trained in facing down hordes of the undead. His only flaw may be his swagger. You sense sometimes that Tallahassee is ready to leave it on the battlefield to go down in a blaze of glory as long as it means getting Zombie Kill of the Year.\n\nMiss Caroline: Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2019s character in Little Monsters has a surprising twist in her backstory, but the craziest part is that we don\u2019t learn she was a Special Forces soldier in the days before she became a kindergarten teacher. (We also can\u2019t say that\u2019s not true.) Miss Caroline doesn\u2019t want to kill, but she will if her hand is forced, and watching her threaten to bleed Teddy McGiggle like livestock if he endangers her schoolchildren is maybe one of the best things Nyong\u2019o has done in her Oscar-winning career.\n\nNevada: We don\u2019t get to see too much of Rosario Dawson as Nevada in Double Tap, but she leaves us wanting so much more. Nevada loves Elvis, carries a six-shooter, and is not here for any of your guff. She lives in an intricate homage to the King that she built herself, and honestly you have to respect someone who demands to live her best life during the end of the world.\n\nNao, cutting her way to the top of the zombie-comedy Hunger Games. Photo: ENBU Seminar\n\nNao: Tallahassee might be a road warrior of the zombie-pocalypse and Teddy McGiggle might be amoral and shameless, but One Cut of the Dead\u2019s Nao (Harumi Syuhama) wins this zom-com game of survival. Nao had to give up acting because she got too into her roles, abandoning inhibition and any sense of self, and in One Cut that meant transforming into an undead-slaying freight train. No one can talk her down. No one can stop her, not even Miss Caroline. When Nao is switched on, your best chance of survival is to run and hide.", "description": "There are three new zombie comedies out right now \u2014 One Cut of The Dead, Zombieland: Double Tap, and Little Monsters \u2014 so which slayer of the undead would win the zom-com Hunger Games?
