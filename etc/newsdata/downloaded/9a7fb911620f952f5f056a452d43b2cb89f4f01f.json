The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.17% closed up 45 points, or 0.2%, at 26,834, buoyed by gains in Merck & Co. MRK, +1.93% and Apple Inc. AAP, -0.52%, which finished at a fresh record high, helping the index to overcome declines in components Nike Inc. NKE, -3.43% and Home Depot HD, -1.07%. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.28% advanced 8.53 points, or 0.3%, to reach 3,005, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.19% finished 16 points, or 0.2%, higher at 8,120. All closing levels are on a preliminary basis. Gains for the broader markets came despite the indexes jumping in and out of negative territory for most of the session. Reports from Boeing, which came in weaker than expected, were initially feared to weigh mightily on the Dow and broader market, however, after the aerospace giant indicated it still expects its 737 MAX jet to return to service by the end of the year, benchmarks drifted higher. Boeing Co. BA, +1.04% shares finished up 1%. Another Dow component Caterpillar CAT, +1.23% also missed both earnings and revenue estimates and cut its full-year 2019 earnings outlook but managed to finish the day up 1.2%.", "description": "U.S. stocks closed higher Wednesday, with the major indexes managing to shake off weakness from corporate quarterly results from the country's biggest names....", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
