'It makes me feel like s***, it's not good and I don't think anybody wants to look at the table.\n\n'I don't think anybody connected with the club will want to check the table at the moment, when you see a team with the calibre of Manchester United, one of the biggest clubs in the world, and you see where they are in the table it is crazy to think how times have changed.\n\n'The players will know what position they are but I don't advise them to look at it because it isn't going to make them feel good. On the other hand, you could say \"come on boys, look at where we are - do we deserve to be here?\"\n\nDimitar Berbatov admits it makes him 'feel like s***' looking at the Premier League table\n\n'Maybe with some of the performances they have produced they deserve to be there and especially if they continue like that, but if they play the way they did like against Liverpool, with aggression and getting in the oppositions' faces, then things will improve.\n\n'I've said it before, but it's not too late to turn things around. OK, don't be looking at first position but fourth isn't far off and there is time to get there but they must continue picking up the points, starting with three this weekend against Norwich.'\n\nUnited, who sit seven points behind fourth-placed Chelsea currently, will be desperate not to lose any more ground in the hunt for a Champions League spot come the end of the season.\n\nUnited haven't won in four Premier League games but they will be hoping to stop their rut when they face 19th-placed Norwich at Carrow Road on Sunday afternoon.", "description": "Manchester United side are currently languishing down in 14th in the Premier League after nine matches, already sitting a massive 15 points behind pace-setters and fierce rivals Liverpool.", "authors": ["Jonathan Spencer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/18/20190128-0-image-a-10_1572023412398.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
