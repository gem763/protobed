The target must be met for the company to be able to issue a further $100 million in secured or unsecured debt, under terms of a bond transaction announced Wednesday.\n\nBy entering the agreement, management was \u201ctying the fortunes of the company to the success of a single product,\u201d Jha wrote, cutting his Street-low price target even further, to 288 pence a share from 327 pence, suggesting about 40% downside from Wednesday\u2019s closing price.\n\n\u201cIf Q4/19 trading is worse than expected or it faces a recall, then AML could face another liquidity squeeze but without any further recourse to debt markets,\u201d he added. Aston Martin\u2019s pound bonds have lost almost 2.5 points since announcing the new financing terms.\n\nA spokeswoman for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nJha\u2019s note came on the same day that Moody\u2019s cut its outlook on Aston Martin\u2019s debt to negative. The rating reflects \u201cthe increased debt from the notes issuance, which will result in continued very high leverage for at least the next 24 months and delay de-leveraging further,\u201d analyst Tobias Wagner wrote in a report. The long-term rating on the company\u2019s debt was also cut by one notch to CCC+ at Standard & Poor\u2019s on Wednesday.\n\nAston Martin rose 5.9% at 2:57 p.m. in London, following its biggest three-day decline in more than a month. The stock is still about 70% below its October initial public offering price of 1,900 pence a share. Shares plunged in July after the company slashed its sales forecast and reported an operating loss for the first half of the year.\n\nBesides Jha\u2019s recommendation, Aston Martin has 5 hold ratings and 4 buys among analysts tracked by Bloomberg.\n\n--With assistance from Laura Benitez.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Joe Easton in London at jeaston7@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Beth Mellor at bmellor@bloomberg.net, Namitha Jagadeesh, Paul Jarvis\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Aston Martin Lagonda may need to price its first ever sports utility vehicle at a discount in order to raise more money via a bond sale tied to a sales target, according to the only equity analyst with a sell rating on the shares.The British carmaker will have to divert all resources to", "authors": ["Joe Easton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/M5DV_3hGs1jq7RtPMQoteQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/f08477aaee7d00548644ce7ab2911996", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
