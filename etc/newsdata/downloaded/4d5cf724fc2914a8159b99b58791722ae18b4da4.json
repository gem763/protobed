The core of Biden\u2019s message to voters from the start has been that Trump is unfit for the job, and Biden often references foreign affairs as he campaigns, but the 76-year-old candidate and his aides see the Syria situation as a new crystallization of what\u2019s at stake.\n\n\u201cHe is a complete failure as commander in chief,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe is the most reckless and incompetent commander in chief we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nBiden forecast a domino effect for Trump\u2019s decision and his isolationist approach in general. \u201cWho will stand with us\u201d in the next international crisis, Biden asked, \u201cif the United States is reduced to an unreliable partner?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cincompetence,\u201d Biden said, demands that he be replaced by someone who \u201con Day One is ready to command the world stage\u201d and rebuild a world order. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be time to build relationships from scratch,\u201d he said, adding that he can \u201cpick up the phone, call our NATO allies, know them by their first name.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s remarks come as his successor, Vice President Mike Pence, prepares to lead a U.S. delegation to press Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for a cease-fire. That mission was complicated Wednesday as Trump dismissed Turkey\u2019s offensive move after the U.S. withdrawal.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey goes onto Syria, that\u2019s between Turkey and Syria. It\u2019s not between Turkey and the United States,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office, even as his administration imposes economic sanctions on Turkey.\n\nThe former vice president tacitly brought his top primary rival, Elizabeth Warren, into his argument, as well. Without naming her, Biden referenced an opponent saying in Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate that she\u2019d withdraw troops from the Middle East.\n\nWarren didn\u2019t go into detail then but said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East.\u201d Her campaign later clarified that she meant combat troops. Warren has said previously that she wants to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Withdrawing troops from the entire region would go further and end generations of U.S. presence in the volatile region.\n\n\u201cWe can be strong and smart at the same time. And when we do draw down, there\u2019s a right way and a wrong way,\u201d Biden retorted in Iowa.\n\nFor his part, Biden has promised to stop \u201cendless wars\u201d in the region, but with qualifications. He advocated in a sweeping foreign policy address in July for removing most combat troops from Afghanistan in favor of \u201cnarrowly focusing our mission\u201d in the region, but he was careful to say that military force would always be an option in his White House.\n\nAnd he outlined again Wednesday a vision of the U.S. leading world alliances with diplomacy and military strength while mocking Trump\u2019s isolationist tendencies and his embrace of U.S. adversaries like Russia and North Korea.\n\n\u201c\u2018America first\u2019 means America alone,\u201d Biden said, nodding to Trump\u2019s stated international doctrine.\n\nInstead, the former vice president said, \u201cleading the free world requires us to show up, have some skin in the game\u201d with investments that yield open markets for U.S. products while providing security for Americans at home and abroad.\n\nBiden recalled that as vice president he negotiated on behalf of President Barack Obama with Turkey\u2019s Erdogan, Kurdish forces and other Middle Eastern players who were part of a \u201cglobal alliance\u201d to fight the Islamic State group.\n\nLeaving the Syrian Kurds without U.S. aid, he said, forces them to fashion uneasy alliances with \u201ctwo devils,\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin and Bashar Assad\u2019s regime in Syria, while Islamic State fighters regroup and rebuild.\n\nBiden highlighted Trump\u2019s sanctions on Turkey as more evidence of the consequences of an \u201cerratic\u201d president because he said it allows Putin to expand his influence in the region amid increasing tensions between two NATO allies \u2014 the U.S and Turkey. Russia is not a member of NATO, and Putin has sought to weaken the group.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s con here. This is not American leadership,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd this is not the end of forever wars. It\u2019s a recipe for more forever wars.\u201d\n\nForeign policy hasn\u2019t typically ranked as a top-line issue for likely Democratic voters in 2020, but Biden found a receptive audience Wednesday.\n\nAnn Cassidy Pfifner, a 66-year-old retired nurse from Long Grove, Iowa, said she came to the event with a short list including Biden, Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. She came away as a Biden supporter.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just right-on as far as foreign policy,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing he knows. And I think it\u2019s what we needed to hear because we haven\u2019t really heard that yet from a candidate.\u201d\n\n___\n\nBarrow reported from Atlanta.\n\n___\n\nFollow the reporters on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP and https://twitter.com/ajjaffe", "description": "DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Seeking to leverage his experience in foreign policy, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Wednesday ripped Donald", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/0d4cd4_election-2020-joe-biden-78339-joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
