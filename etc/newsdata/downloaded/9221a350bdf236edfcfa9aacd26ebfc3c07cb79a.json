As reported by The New York Times, the remixed \u201cKingsman\u201d scene was shown at a Miami conference for Trump supporters. The event was held at the Trump National Doral Miami and organized by the group American Priority.\n\nThe scene from \u201cKingsman\u201d features Colin Firth\u2019s character Harry Hart entering a hate group\u2019s church in Kentucky (modeled after the Westboro Baptist Church) and violently murdering its members. Harry is brainwashed during the scene and is not willingly killing people. The re-edited video puts Trump\u2019s face on Firth\u2019s body. The victims faces have been replaced with either the logos of news brands such as Vice and CNN or the faces of outspoken Trump critics such as Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Maxine Waters, and Barack Obama, among others. The church in the film has been renamed the \u201cChurch of Fake News\u201d in the Trump video.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nAn organizer of the event told The Times that the clip had been played at the conference as part of a \u201cmeme exhibit.\u201d The spokesperson said in a statement, \u201cContent was submitted by third parties and was not associated with or endorsed by the conference in any official capacity. American Priority rejects all political violence and aims to promote a healthy dialogue about the preservation of free speech. This matter is under review.\u201d\n\nA Trump spokesman said the president knew nothing of the video and added, \u201cThat video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence.\u201d White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted that Trump had not yet seen the video as of Monday morning, but \u201cbased upon everything he has heard he strongly condemns [it].\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported on the specifics of the edited \u201cKingsman\u201d video, writing, \u201cMr. Trump attacks a range of his critics. He strikes the late Arizona senator John McCain in the back of the neck. He hits the television personality Rosie O\u2019Donnell in the face and then stabs her in the head. He strikes Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California. He lights the head of Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential rival, on fire.\u201d\n\nIndieWire has reached out to representatives for Disney/Fox and Matthew Vaughn for further comment.\n\nBest of IndieWire\n\nSign up for Indiewire's Newsletter.
