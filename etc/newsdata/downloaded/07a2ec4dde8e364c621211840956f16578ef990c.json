Contractors have filed hundreds of complaints, which date back to the 1980s, alleging that the real estate company did not pay them.\n\n\u201cWe believe in paying people when they do great jobs. And we get people paid incredibly quickly. And we pay contractors,\u201d said Eric Trump, executive vice president of The Trump Organization at Yahoo Finance\u2019s All Market Summit, adding that the organization only refuses to pay contractors who fail to complete a job.\n\n\u201cYeah, well, they [the unpaid contractors] didn't finish a job. And they didn't do a good job. And they flaked out. And they were two months behind schedule. And so you had to let go of them. And you had to bring somebody else in to do the job that they otherwise would have. And it's called the real world,\u201d he said, referring to the allegations. \u201cPeople like to take cheap shots at us.\u201d\n\nEric Trump\u2019s defense echoes his father\u2019s status quo response.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential debate, President Donald Trump said something very similar. \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work,\u201d he said in response to nonpayment accusations.\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - OCTOBER 10: Eric Trump attends the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit at Union West Events on October 10, 2019 in New York City.

You know your way around. You know the language. You know the laws. You know how things are built. You know what kind of foundations work in the ground.\u201d\n\nSarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
