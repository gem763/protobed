The sectors that did better than most are financial services, banking and insurance where the gap is 2 per cent. The gender pay gap is still quite high in India, the report that was released last week said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording MSI, the current gender pay gap has men earning Rs 46.19 more in comparison to women. The median gross hourly salary for men in India in 2018 stood at Rs 242.49, while for women it stood at around Rs196.3.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey also revealed a gap across industries. IT/ITES services showed a sharp pay gap of 26 per cent in favour of men, while in the manufacturing sector, men earn 24 per cent more than women.\n\n\n\n\n\nSectors like healthcare, caring services and social work also had men earning more than women, by 21 per cent. The finding came as a surprise since these sectors are primarily identified more with women, the survey said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report said that the gender pay gap widens with experience. In the initial career years, the gap is moderate but rises significantly as the years of experience increase. For those with over 10 years of experience, the gender pay gap in favour of men reaches the peak, with men earning 15 per cent more than women.", "description": "The latest Monster Salary index reveals a stark gender pay gap in India, women earn less, certain sectors better than others", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/sthwage86305716l1571728068.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
