After the first, in April, coalition talks fell apart and a snap poll was called.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption The Joint List alliance gave their recommendation to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin\n\nFaced with yet another deadlock, Israel's president Reuven Rivlin has recommended the new government includes both Mr Gantz's Blue and White Alliance, and Mr Netanyahu's Likud party.\n\nMr Rivlin has said he will do everything he can to avoid a third general election in Israel this year.\n\nAymen Odeh, leader of Joint List, told President Rivlin the alliance's priority was to prevent Mr Netanyahu from serving another term.\n\nJoint List won 13 seats in the election. If Mr Gantz had the endorsement of all 13 seats, he would still fall short of the 61 seats needed for a majority in the 120-seat legislature.\n\nThis is a significant exercise of political power by Israel's Palestinian citizens.\n\nPresident Rivlin is consulting party leaders about whom he should ask to lead the country after last week's inconclusive election results. The Arab parties put in a strong showing, becoming the third largest force in the legislature.\n\nTheir support will not give Benny Gantz and his Blue & White alliance a majority, but it will give him a boost in negotiations about who gets the first chance to form a government.\n\nThe leader of the Arab grouping, Ayman Odeh, said it wasn't endorsing Mr Gantz and his polices: but was moving to try and block Benjamin Netanyahu from securing another term, and to send a clear message that Israel's future must include the full and equal participation of its Palestinian citizens.\n\nMore on the Israeli elections:", "description": "The endorsement is the first of its kind by an Arab political group in Israel in more than 25 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6860/production/_108902762_8f473aac-428d-4a2c-a7f4-4cd4fb786be8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
