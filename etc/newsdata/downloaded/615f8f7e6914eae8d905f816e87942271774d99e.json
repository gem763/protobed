After coming in a tie for ninth on 11-under the previous week at the PGA Championship at Wentworth, McIlroy, who has barely played on the European Tour in 2019, made his frustrations clear.\n\n\u201cI'm honestly sick of coming back over to the European Tour and shooting 15-under and finishing somewhere around 30th - I don't think the courses are set up hard enough,\u201d McIlroy, the world No 2, said. \u201cThere are no penalties for bad shots. It's tough when you come back when it's like that. I don't feel like good golf is regarded as well as it could be.\n\n\u201cIt happened at the Scottish Open [in July]. I shot 13-under and finished 30th. It\u2019s not a good test. I think if the European Tour wants to put forth a really good product, the courses and setups need to be tougher.\u201d\n\nHis comments will make depressing reading at Wentworth HQ. McIlroy eventually consented to rejoin the Tour in May, but is clearly displeased and plainly more adamant than ever to focus on the Stateside circuit. He won the $15m FedEx Cup first prize last month and feels that the criticism he has faced has been unjust and pointed out the appearance fees he is turning down on the European Tour.", "description": "Rory McIlroy has told the European Tour that he will continue to concentrate on America because the courses are \u201ctoo easy\u201d on his home circuit.", "authors": ["James Corrigan", "Golf Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2019/09/29/TELEMMGLPICT000211361583-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6T3sITYSLXjxZ2r5P2DKq3EHn0VdPbMCMmOyJwYfPFw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
