Are you seriously saying you thought that was appropriate for your elderly mother?\n\n'So she gets a gift of a shovel and the gift of hard labour in your garden...what did she do with it in your front garden?'\n\nLacomba replied: 'I think she might have used it to do the digging where bricks were laid in the ground but I don't think she used it that often.'\n\nBut Miss Morgan responded: 'This is complete nonsense, isn't it Mr Lacomba? Complete nonsense that the shovel was a gift for your elderly mother.\n\nDetectives searched for thousands of man hours for Ms Wellgreen's body after she went missing in New Ash Green, Kent, last October - but it has never been found\n\n'And the reason why you have made that up is because you don't have a sensible explanation why you have a shovel of that size in your shed.'\n\nLacomba simply replied 'No it's not'.\n\nHe added he bought it in either a branch of B&Q or Wickes in Dartford 'with his mother in mind', thinking it would give her 'better leverage' when digging.\n\nDuring cross-examination he was also repeatedly asked where he had buried Sarah, and to point her grave out on a map of potential search locations identified by police.\n\nBut he said: 'What you have seen and heard doesn't look good for me but I'm letting the jury know and everyone in this court that I have not murdered the mother of my children, Sarah Wellgreen.'\n\nLacomba was also asked by the prosecution if his mother, a schoolteacher, was involved 'in a clear-up operation' on the morning of October 10.\n\nMrs Lacomba was the first person he phoned after he claimed to have found his ex-partner missing from their home.\n\nHe told the jury he said to his mother that Sarah 'was not at home' and he did not know her whereabouts.\n\nCCTV footage showed Mrs Lacomba then arriving at the four-bedroomed property at 7.38am on October 10 last year - 20 minutes after her son's telephone call.\n\nBut having told the court he needed help with childcare, Mrs Lacomba was seen leaving the house just 11 minutes later before returning at 8.04am.\n\nHaving questioned why Lacomba had not first phoned Sarah to see where she might be, Miss Morgan asked: 'Was there a clear-up operation going on at your home that day?'\n\nWhen he explained he did not understand what she meant, Miss Morgan said: 'What was your mother doing that morning?'\n\nBut having replied he asked his mother to come around to the house to help with the children, Miss Morgan questioned why Mrs Lacomba had then left just a few minutes after arriving.\n\n'She leaves for nearly 15 minutes. Did you ask her to do anything for you in those 15 minutes?', she asked.\n\nPolice during the search for Ms Wellgreen in Kent last October. She has never been found and prosecutors say she was murdered\n\n'Not that I recall,' replied Lacomba.\n\nMiss Morgan continued: 'You called your mum in desperation because you needed help with the children. Why on earth would she leave just 11 minutes later?'\n\nLacomba told the court he could not remember, but added his mother had 'come round in quite a rush' and may have forgotten her medication.\n\nThe court heard he and Sarah met online in 2004 and were together for 10 years.\n\nAfter a lengthy and acrimonious split, Sarah moved to Portsmouth before returning to the family home in May last year to co-parent with Lacomba under the same roof.\n\nBut at the time she was allegedly murdered, she was in a new relationship, had landed a well-paid job and was in the process of buying Lacomba out of his share in the house.\n\nThe prosecution allege Lacomba murdered Sarah 'in a calculated manner and to avoid detection', possibly motivated by the potential loss of his home and having only limited access to his children.\n\nDespite extensive searches there has been no trace and her body has never been found.\n\nHer handbag, car, jewellery, purse, bank cards and two mobile phones were all left behind.\n\nHer main phone, an iPhone 4, has never been recovered but Lacomba denied disposing of it.\n\nHe has admitted however that he threw his own two smartphones in the River Thames and Greenhithe, Kent, five days after Sarah disappeared.\n\nHe told the jury he did not want police to retrieve deleted data as it would 'make him look bad'.\n\nBut he was caught on CCTV just before 11.20pm on October 14, walking from his car parked in Serenity Court and towards the water.\n\nThe court heard however there was no trace of him for an hour-and-a-half after he had driven off from his home at 9.36pm.\n\n'Did you go back to where you buried Sarah that night? Did you go back to make sure everything was cleared up properly?' asked Miss Morgan.\n\n'I haven't buried Sarah anywhere,' Lacomba replied, who earlier in his evidence told the jury he had been 'winding himself up and 'chewing things over in his mind' in that time gap.\n\n'I have said what I was doing in that hour-and-a-half.'", "description": "A jury at Woolwich Crown Court has been told the garden at the house shared by Sarah Wellgreen and ex Ben Lacomba (pictured) consisted of artificial grass.", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/19/19800816-0-image-a-10_1571249354992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
