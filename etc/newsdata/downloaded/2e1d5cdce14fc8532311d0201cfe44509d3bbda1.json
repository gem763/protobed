The answer is NOTHING.\n\nIf those 354 congressmen and women really and truly want to help the Kurds, want to use the U.S. military to ensure we never abandon the Kurds, nothing less than the Constitution gives them the power to do exactly that.\n\nSo why is Congress abandoning the Kurds when they have the constitutional authority to not abandon the Kurds?\n\nIf Congress wants to go from \u201cLet\u2019s kill ISIS together\u201d to \u201cLet\u2019s fight a NATO ally together,\u201d by all means, do it.\n\nAfter all, the whole idea of the War Powers Act is to ensure the president cannot declare war unilaterally, which is what the monarchs of old did constantly.\n\n\u201cThe provision of the Constitution giving the war-making powers to Congress, was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons: Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object,\u201d a young congressman named Abraham Lincoln wrote. \u201cThis, our [Constitutional] Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, despite countless wars in the 77 years since, Congress has not declared war once since World War II.\n\nThe reason for this is obvious: Congress is abdicating its responsibility to avoid having to deal with the political blame should things go sideways, and in war things always go sideways.\n\nSo instead of accepting the awesome responsibility of declaring war, the gutless wonders in Congress have surrendered all of that authority to one man, the president, which is exactly what our Founders wished to avoid.\n\nBut it is so much easier that way, you see, because avoiding responsibility allows these cowards to snipe, second-guess, heckle, posture, and backseat drive from the cheap seats. Which is exactly what they are doing with the Kurds.\n\nDo you want to know why Congress won\u2019t vote for a war resolution to save the Syrian Kurds? Or even an \u201cauthorization for the use of military force,\u201d as it did after Sep. 11, 2001?\n\nLet me count the ways\u2026\n\nThe Kurds in Turkey and Syria are at war with Turkey and have been for freakin\u2019 centuries (the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) if Iraq has maintained friendly ties to Ankara). Turkey is our NATO ally, so Congress wants Trump to risk war with a NATO ally, but they sure as hell won\u2019t do it themselves. A good relationship with Turkey is vital to our Middle East posture. We are already worried about Turkey aligning with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iran, which Erdogan seems increasingly interested in doing. The Kurds only fight for the Kurds. It was in their (and Syria\u2019s) best interest to fight ISIS \u2013 and it still is. The Turkish government believes our Syrian Kurdish allies (the YPG, or People\u2019s Protection Units) fight alongside the PKK (Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party), a group of fevered communists that have called for separatist uprisings among the Kurds in Turkey. In other words, they are causing all kinds of trouble in Turkey. The YPG tends to be pan-Kurdish and build bridges to all Kurdish groups, but is a distinct entity than the PKK, which largely focuses on attacking Turkish police and soldiers. Oh, and did I mention the PKK is designated as a terrorist organization by our own government? So America should shield terrorists as these terrorists conduct operations against a fellow NATO ally [assuming, and it\u2019s a big if, that Erdogan is telling the truth about the PKK and the YPG]? Hey, if you think that\u2019s a good idea, VOTE ON IT! The Kurds are stateless and looking to create their own territory out of the land they are indigenous to, which consists of chunks of Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Turkey. The YPG are focusing on pieces of Syria right along Turkish border, which Turkey, for obvious reasons (the PKK), finds intolerable. Not for nothing, for years the Turks have been warning about securing the border region against the PKK. Which means that the vaunted international community has had those years to work this out peacefully, but they would rather condemn Israel and swoon over Greta. It\u2019s all an unholy mess, but if Congress wants to use our troops to fight on the side of designated terrorists against a NATO ally \u2013 then STFU and do it! Yes, we want to help the YPG, but our allies-by-treaty say this helps the PKK, and a war between Turkey and the Kurds helps another enemy of ours, Syria, while pushing Turkey deeper into the arms of Russia and Iran.\n\nAnd now we come to my favorite\u2026\n\nThere is no endgame, no exit plan, no light at the end of a tunnel in a local border skirmish that predates our own Civil War and will outlive the great-grandchildren of everyone reading this.\n\nSo what you have is a spineless U.S. Congress passing resolutions against Trump for abandoning the Kurds when this same spineless U.S. Congress has the authority to ensure the Kurds are not abandoned, but refuses to act on that authority.\n\nTrump at least has an endgame, he got the hell out, which should not have surprised anyone familiar with his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAs far as whether or not the removal of those 50 or so troops was Turkey\u2019s green-light to move in, let me state this as clearly as I can: I. Don\u2019t. Care. No one was doing anything to solve the problem peacefully, so there was no exit plan for us, we were going to have to stay there forever, be the world\u2019s policeman forever, which made those 50 or so troops a potential trigger for a war with Turkey.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t legal for us to be there, because ISIS had no presence there, and Congress only authorized military attacks on al-Qaeda and its offshoots (ISIS among them). Congress could have made it legal, but they didn\u2019t.\n\nIf Turkey decided to move to secure the border region with us still there, that would mean moving against our guys, and then it\u2019s more young American death and dismemberment in the sand because we got dragged into something that has nothing to do with us yet again.\n\nBut, hey, if Congress wants to not abandon the Kurds, wants to take ownership of this, wants to grow a spine for once, they have the power.\n\nAnd if they don\u2019t use that power, it only proves what a bunch of hypocritical, mewling little cowards they all are.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
