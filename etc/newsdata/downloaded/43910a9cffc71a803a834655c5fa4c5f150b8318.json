Moments later, the lion grinned similarly to when someone 'winks at you to say like: haha!', according to Gren\n\nGren said the lion had roared to tell him 'I'm the King of the jungle' and to probably say 'he was full' before smiling similarly to when someone 'winks at you to say like: haha!'\n\nHe was 10-15 metres from the lion who was crossing a stream with a lioness - and was 'taken aback by the sheer size and scale of [the lion]'.\n\nGren told SWNS: 'From him being very still and quiet then for him to let out a big boom was quite something.'\n\nThe photographer says he regular goes on safaris and says the lions are 'used to cars and tourists' as they have 'grown up' surrounded by the group trips (file image)\n\nHe said 'The King of the Jungle' is 'always something you've got to capture' and is overjoyed that he managed to get the shot.\n\nThe photographer, from Whitley Bay in Northumberland, said he was 'really happy with the photos' and had only looked at them properly once he got home.\n\n'I regularly go on these safaris and really enjoy photographing wildlife. They have grown up around the safari so they're used to cars and tourists.'\n\nPeople have shared their feelings of being unnerved by the photos on Facebook.\n\nDorothy Chapman wrote: 'Just as well it was an after dinner yawn, otherwise you could have been the main course. Wonderful photo Gren, pleased to hear your back safe and sound.'\n\nSteve Symington said: 'Massive mouth... hate to be caught in that.'\n\nMeanwhile Mark Sam Shields shared appreciation: 'Wow what photos one of my favorite animals thank u.'", "description": "Wildlife photographer Gren Sowerby, 69, says the lion wanted to tell him 'I'm the King of the jungle' as he roared and then flashed him a smile on a safari in Maasai Mara, Kenya last month.", "authors": ["Phoebe Eckersley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/18/19600706-0-image-a-2_1570814643060.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
