It is difficult to understand how Democratic candidates can be \u201cfor\u201d these communities\u2014advocating tolerance along the way\u2014if they are actively lobbying to put them out of business.\n\nThird, policy analysts should assess the damage O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal would cause to the charitable sector. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s stance\u2014if played out to its end\u2014would decimate the charitable sector. It is certainly the case that massive amounts of government funding flow through religious charitable organizations in the form of grants and tax-exemptions. But anyone who thinks this is simply a pass through that can be redirected to government providers or newly established charitable networks that better conform to Democratic orthodoxies is na\u00efve to the realities of the charitable sector.", "description": "", "authors": ["John Inazu", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Beto-Orourkes-Pluralism-Failure"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
