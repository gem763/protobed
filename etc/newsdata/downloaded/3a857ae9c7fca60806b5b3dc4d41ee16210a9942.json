(We think \u201cFleabag\u201d could be a surprise dark horse.) Can \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d live up to the expectations of 32 (!) nominations, 10 of which it has already won? Could critical favorite \u201cWhen They See Us\u201d triumph over surprise hit \u201cChernobyl\u201d in the limited series category?\n\nAll of these questions will be answered when the show starts at 8 p.m. on Fox \u2014 follow along below for updates from the red carpet. (A complete list of nominations is here.)\n\nThis story will update frequently with coverage of the red carpet, winners, speeches and analysis. (Refresh to update.)\n\n\u2015\n\n6:55: This is a big weekend for Billy Porter, who turned 50 on Saturday. The actor is a favorite to win best lead actor in a drama for his acclaimed turn as Pray Tell, a nurturing ball scene emcee in FX\u2019s \u201cPose.\u201d \u201cAll of my dreams are coming true,\u201d said Porter, who called Pray Tell \u201cthe role of a lifetime.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m grateful that I could live to see the day that I could stand in my authenticity.\u201d\n\nIf Porter wins Sunday, he will be on his way to EGOT \u2014 he won a Tony in 2013 for \u201cKinky Boots,\u201d and a Grammy the following year for the same production.\n\n\u2015\n\n6:40: The Emmys are as nerve wracking as you might think for introverts like Laura Linney. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very natural environment to be in,\u201d the \u201cOzark\u201d star \u2014 nominated for best lead actress in a drama series \u2014 told E!\u2019 s Jason Kennedy. Linney added that it is \u201ca privilege\u201d to work on the Netflix series, which is apparently a favorite of NBA star LeBron James.\n\n\u2015\n\n6:39: Lin Manuel-Miranda feels \u201clike a proud grandpa\u201d because \u201cFosse/Verdon,\u201d on which he\u2019s executive producer, earned a whopping 17 Emmy nods. When he learned the news, he said, \u201cI jumped up and down in my apartment.\u201d His plan tonight? Cheering until his voice gives out.\n\n\u2015\n\n6:33: Billy Bush is back on the red carpet, where he\u2019s reportedly received an \u201centhusiastic response\u201d from his former colleagues.\n\nThis comes three years after The Washington Post published audio of a 2005 conversation between Bush and Donald Trump, in which the then-reality TV host bragged about groping women. In the aftermath, Bush lost his job on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d and Trump was elected president.\n\nBush, who started a new job hosting on \u201cExtra Extra\u201d this month, told a Variety reporter on the Emmys carpet, \u201cI get anxious before any carpet, or anything I do on a work front, always a little butterflies. You want things to go well.\u201d\n\nBut is he worried about someone saying something about \u201cthe controversy,\u201d as the reporter put it? \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Bush responded. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna be \u2014 that\u2019s really old. I think it\u2019s going to be great.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n6:28: What\u2019s it like to attend an award show as a nominee? Betty Gilpin, up for her supporting performance in \u201cGLOW,\u201d said you feel like \u201cyour most poodle, Versaille, porn self and your most under-the-bridge troll self.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n6:11: Tony Hale, nominated in the comedy category for his supporting role on \u201cVeep,\u201d described his strenuous Emmys prep: \u201cI cooked an egg, I had a glass of water and I got ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cVeep,\u201d which is also up for outstanding comedy series, concluded its seventh and final season in May, but Hale said it \u201ccontinues to be hard to say goodbye.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe like each other a little too much,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2015\n\n6:07: Jameela Jamil, one of the stars of \u201cThe Good Place, which is preparing to enter its final season, said she \u201ccried my face off\u201d when they finished filming the finale. She joked that fans should blame its creator Michael Schur for it ending. Quickly, though, she offered a heartfelt thanks to Schur: \u201cThis man took a chance on me for no good reason,\u201d she said, again adding that when filming wrapped, \u201cI cried and cried and cried all night.\u201d\n\n\u2015\n\n6:05: \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d alumna Laverne Cox brought an ACLU attorney with her to the red, er, purple carpet. The pair talked about the Supreme Court\u2019s upcoming vote on a Trump administration brief that argues Title VII \u2014 the landmark statute that prohibits employment discrimination \u2014 does not protect employees from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Cox\u2019s rainbow-colored clutch featured a rundown of the cases\u2019 most significant details, including the date Oct. 8, which is when the court will hear cases.\n\n\u201cA lot of people aren\u2019t talking about this case and it has implications for the LGBTQ community, but it has implications for women and anyone who doesn\u2019t conform to someone else\u2019s idea of how you should be a man or a woman or both or neither,\u201d Cox told Guiliana Rancic.\n\nIt was a markedly political intro to E!\u2019 s pre-show coverage, but Cox noted, \u201cIt\u2019s not all political, like I dance around in my underwear, too.\u201d That aside led Rancic to ask about the looks the actress was serving at Rihanna\u2019s recent Savage X Fenty fashion show.\n\n\u2015\n\n6:03: Your eyes are not deceiving you: Stars are arriving and stopping to chat on a carpet that is not red, but a deep shade of purple. According to the show\u2019s producers, the color is intended to evoke notions of \u201croyalty.\u201d\n\nSpotted first #Emmys nominee to arrive on purple carpet: @SterlingKBrown in red tux jacket and @LouboutinWorld shoes. pic.twitter.com/gHyZHNiRU4 \u2014 Chris Gardner (@chrissgardner) September 22, 2019\n\n\u2015\n\n5:53: A large majority of Emmy Awards were given out before tonight at last weekend\u2019s Creative Arts Emmys, including categories ranging from outstanding animated program (\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d) to best guest actress in a comedy series (Jane Lynch for \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d Check out our coverage of the trophies that have already gone out.\n\n[10 things you missed at the Creative Arts Emmys, from \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 domination to James Corden besting Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 again]\n\n\u2015\n\n5:45: A few answers to your frequently asked questions about the Emmys:\n\nWhere can I watch the Emmy Awards on TV?\n\nThe 71st Primetime Emmy Awards air Sunday, Sept. 22, from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Fox.\n\nWhere can I watch the Emmys online?\n\nIf you subscribe to a TV provider or have the log-in information, you can stream the show on fox.com/live. You can also try the Fox Now app on most mobile devices.\n\nWho is hosting?\n\nTaking a cue from the Oscars, there is no host this year. Apparently celebrities are very hesitant to host award shows these days \u2014 mostly because it\u2019s a ton of work only to get inevitably ripped apart on Twitter.\n\nWhen is the red carpet so I can watch and judge all the fashion?\n\nAt 6 p.m., E! airs its typical \u201cLive From the Red Carpet\u201d special. People magazine and Entertainment Weekly also have a red-carpet show, which you can watch at their respective websites. At 6:30, Fox\u2019s pre-show kicks off; celebrity arrivals start around 7, and hosts include \u201cMasked Singer\u201d judge Jenny McCarthy, Fox Sports anchor Shannon Sharpe and former \u201cFashion Police\u201d panelist Kelly Osbourne.\n\nWhich show has the most nominations?\n\nHBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has a whopping 32 Emmy nods, which is the record for most nominations for a show in a single season. Not far behind: \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d with 20, HBO\u2019s \u201cChernobyl\u201d with 19 and NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d with 18.", "description": "\"Game of Thrones\" is nominated for the most awards with 32, while \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" is close behind with 20.", "authors": ["Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture", "Elahe Izadi", "Pop Culture Writer", "Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter", "Travis M.
