(Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg)\n\nDuring past disruptions of Middle Eastern oil exports, the United States felt considerable pain as gasoline and other fuel prices soared.\n\nCosts could still climb in the coming weeks if Saudi Arabia doesn\u2019t quickly restore its oil output after a drone attack that is stoking new tensions in the region. But these days the United States isn\u2019t quite as vulnerable to oil price shocks.\n\nA decade-long boom in domestic extraction has turned the United States into the world\u2019s largest oil producer, a position that will cushion the economy in new ways, economists and energy experts say.\n\nEven as prices rise at the pump, more-expensive oil will reward Texas, North Dakota and other parts of the country that produce petroleum, boosting investment in rigs and pipelines and potentially creating new jobs that put more money in consumers\u2019 pockets. More-valuable U.S. oil exports will also help defend the country\u2019s trade balance.\n\nThis time around, the United States is in a better position to increase its oil exports to help keep global prices down.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. produces so much oil now, it just has a bigger offsetting impact,\u201d said Kenneth B Medlock III, senior director of the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy, which receives funding from foundations, the government, petroleum companies and others. \u201cToday we just live in a different world.\u201d\n\nThe higher fuel efficiency of today\u2019s U.S. cars will also help soften the blow of price spikes, energy experts say.\n\nMany Americans worry that rising U.S. oil production will sap the nation\u2019s motivation to lower its fossil fuel use and embrace cleaner sources of energy. Climate scientists say higher exports that help lower global prices could also motivate other countries to keep guzzling oil, increasing emissions of carbon dioxide, which are a key driver of climate change.\n\n[Most American teens are frightened by climate change, poll finds, and about 1 in 4 are taking action]\n\nEconomists say failure to reduce atmospheric warming trends will create huge economic costs, through flooding, rising seas, damage to agriculture and other problems.\n\nThe Obama administration estimated that every ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere will produce roughly $45 in costs by 2020, a measure known as the social cost of carbon. Global carbon emissions were projected to reach a record high of 37 billion tons last year, a rise of 2.7 percent. Global energy consumption grew at a similar rate.\n\nU.S. crude-oil production has more than doubled since the mid-2000s, to an all-time high of 12 million barrels a day. The boom began after companies started using hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and horizontal drilling to reach oil trapped in shale rock.\n\nThat surge caused U.S. exports of crude and refined oil to rise, and imports to fall. The United States has gone from importing 60 percent of the oil it consumed in the mid-2000s to about 6 percent today, on a net basis, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.\n\nCrude-oil imports from Saudi Arabia have fallen to about 600,000 barrels a day this year, from about 1.5 million a day in 2008.\n\nThe production boom has been a major factor driving U.S. economic growth. In the first two years of the Trump administration, the energy sector contributed to more than half of the U.S. rise in industrial output, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nWhen oil prices rise, businesses invest more in infrastructure to boost production, Jason P. Brown, a research and policy officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said in an interview. Hiring also tends to rise when prices do, though U.S. energy job growth in the most recent price upturn wasn\u2019t as pronounced as in past years because companies are working more efficiently and require fewer workers, he said.\n\nOverall, \u201cwe are less vulnerable to high oil prices negatively affecting the U.S. economy,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBecause of the domestic shale-oil-and-gas industry, we\u2019re now more in a position to take advantage of that.\u201d\n\nNone of this frees U.S. energy consumers from events in the Middle East. Oil prices are set on the global market, influenced by supply, demand and happenings such as the attack on Saudi Arabia. As long as the United States consumes oil, it will never be truly energy independent.\n\n\u201cThere is a greater sense of confidence and resilience and diversification, but at the end of the day there is still one global oil market,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of data and research firm IHS Markit, and author of \u201cThe Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power.\u201d\n\n[U.S. takes a low profile as nations gather in New York to debate steps to combat climate change]\n\nHouthi rebels from Yemen claimed responsibility for Saturday\u2019s aerial attacks on Saudi Arabia, which caused raging fires at the giant Abqaiq oil-processing facility and forced the kingdom to suspend more than half of its production. That cut, equaling 6 percent of global oil supplies, sent prices spiking.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Saudi Oil Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said the kingdom had restored half of the suspended production and would restore the rest by the end of this month. In the meantime, it is tapping its strategic oil reserves to ensure regular deliveries to the global market, he said, sending oil prices lower.\n\n\u201cThe two big questions are: How long does it take the Saudis to repair Abqaiq and bring production back on? The second really big question is: What happens next?\u201d Yergin said. \u201cAs far as Saudi Arabia is concerned, this was an act of war. And it was carried out with great precision.\u201d\n\nThe strike is fueling new tensions between the United States and Iran, with the Trump administration all but explicitly accusing Tehran of launching the strikes from its territory, despite Yemeni rebels claiming responsibility. Iran denied the accusation and warned of consequences if it is attacked.\n\n\u201cOne thing is for sure: This attack shines a spotlight on the vulnerability of Middle Eastern oil supplies,\u201d said Shaia Hosseinzadeh, managing partner of OnyxPoint Global Management, which invests in the energy industry.\n\nAlthough Saudi Arabia\u2019s production suspension was one of the largest in recent history, the market reaction has been more muted than in past scares.\n\nDuring the Arab oil embargo of 1973, Middle Eastern producers stopped shipping oil to the United States and other countries as punishment for their support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War. That caused a 350 percent jump in oil prices, helping cause an economic downturn in the United States.\n\nThe 1979 Iranian Revolution caused another spike, as did the Persian Gulf War and the Iraq War.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. economy was much more vulnerable to oil price shocks in the 1970s because then our economy was much less energy efficient than today, oil import dependence was higher, and government price controls and rationing hampered quick and efficient responses by consumers and producers,\u201d said Robert McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group and a former national security aide on energy matters for President George W. Bush.\n\nReal freedom from oil-and-gas-price shocks can happen only if the United States replaces fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. Wind, solar and hydro energy are increasingly fueling power generation in the United States, accounting for 17 percent of electricity production last year, up from 13 percent in 2013, according to the Energy Information Administration. Natural gas, coal and nuclear energy accounted for the rest.\n\nOil still reigns supreme in transportation, though. Electric vehicle sales are a growing but still minor sliver of the market.\n\nAnd oil byproducts are still integral to a dizzying array of U.S. goods, including fertilizer, asphalt, rayon clothing and more.\n\n\u201cWe are locked in without knowing how locked in we are, which really does make it a crisis,\u201d said Deborah Gordon, a climate and energy expert at Brown University\u2019s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, which receives funding from the government, foundations and others. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have an electric car, and oil goes away.\u201d", "description": "American oil production has more than doubled since the 2000s, making the economy less vulnerable to oil price shocks.", "authors": ["Jeanne Whalen", "Reporter Covering Business Around The World", "September At Pm", "Jeanne Whalen Is A Reporter Covering Business Around The World.
