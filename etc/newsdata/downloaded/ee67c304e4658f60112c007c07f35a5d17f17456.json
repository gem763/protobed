Bizarre moment a passing swan rides the first waves at a new inland surfing lake in Bristol", "language": "en", "text": "This is the hilarious moment a swan swimming in an artificial surfing lagoon gives up fighting the current and instead rides the waves.\n\nThe bird was seen floating in the new \u00a325million inland lake at Easter Compton, Bristol, which boasts an impressive wave machine.\n\nAt first the elegant creature paddles frantically against the wash and tackles the waves head-on.\n\nBut after making little progress, it allows itself to be scooped up by the curling surf - before being unceremoniously dunked.\n\nThe swan tackles the waves head on at the new \u00a325million inland lake at Easter Compton, Bristol, paddling frantically to get up and over the crest\n\nThe bizarre footage was captured by staff at The Wave, which will open its 590ft long freshwater surfing experience in November.\n\nIn the video, the swan is seen floating in the middle of the 656ft wide channel, which is testing out its artificial wave generator.\n\nA rolling surf rumbles through the water, with each crest about 10 seconds apart.\n\nInitially, the swan noses into the wave head-on and scrabbles its webbed feet to climb up the wave before dipping over the top of the crest.\n\nThe second time, it turns around to face away from the wave, appearing as though it is positioning itself to catch the surf.\n\nThe swan is scooped up to the crest of the wave before dipping down on the other side into its wake\n\nBut at the last minute, it backs out and spins to face it, again going over front-facing.\n\nHowever eventually it gives up fighting the surf and turns away from the waves.\n\nAs one approaches, it paddles quickly to gather momentum before it is picked up by the wave and rides to the top of the crest.\n\nBut this surf was short-lived, for the swan lost balance and tumbled from the crest, crashing down sideways into its wake.", "description": "The bird was seen floating in the new \u00a325million inland lake at Easter Compton, Bristol, which boasts an impressive wave machine.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/16/20089378-0-image-a-120_1571844395285.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
