We will update you when we have chosen a new supplier, who will then get in touch about your new tariff.'\n\nSo far, Eversmart, Solarplicity, Brilliant Energy, Extra Energy, Spark Energy, Future Energy, National Gas and Power, Iresa Energy, Gen4U, Usio Energy, One Select, Our Power and Economy Energy have all gone bust in recent times.\n\nYesterday, it was revealed that energy suppliers - big and small - face tough new reforms from the regulator in an effort to drive up customer service standards and reduce the risk of failure.\n\nThe proposals will ensure fast growing energy firms can demonstrate they are able to take on additional customers effectively and meet industry obligations while also remaining financially viable, Ofgem says.\n\nA number have gone bust thanks to increased competition in the market which has led to some smaller companies unable to keep up the pace of more competitive firms.\n\nCordelia Samson, energy expert at uSwitch, said: 'Toto are the eighth energy company to go bust this year, hot on the heels of Ofgem's announcement about toughening up the rules for existing providers, to minimise the risk of more of them going out of business.\n\n'This latest supplier failure must raise serious questions for the regulator, which allowed it to acquire over 40,000 customers from another now-defunct energy company only three months ago.\n\n'Toto were known to be struggling with customer service and running their operations efficiently.\n\n'They also missed making their payments for renewable energy this year. While they had made improvements, clearly these weren't enough to keep them afloat.\n\n'Households affected by this news should now wait for a new supplier to be appointed by Ofgem. In the meantime, their energy supplies and credit balances will be protected, and they should take a meter reading ready for when the new supplier contacts them.'\n\nCustomers have been complaining on social media about the company weeks before it went bust:\n\nThis Twitter user said that communication with the energy company was 'useless'\n\nAnother customer said he thought Toto was 'disgracefully bad' and 'offer no help whatsoever'\n\nThis customer said people should not switch to Toto, suggesting he had a bad experience\n\nAlex Dickson, head of research at Switchcraft said: 'That Toto Energy \u2013 a company with an appalling track record \u2013 was able to purchase 43,000 new customers only three months ago is dumbfounding.\n\n'These customers were acquired from the now defunct Solarplicity and are being palmed off to their third supplier in as many months.\n\n'UK consumers deserve better than to be passed around and dropped like hot potatoes; lessons need to be learned.\n\n'The sad fact of the matter is worse is likely to come. UK's overcrowded energy supplier market is now rapidly contracting and that means more hardship for consumers.'\n\nIn a recent Citizen's Advice league table of domestic energy firms, ranked by customer service, Toto Energy were ranked 37th out of 39 suppliers.", "description": "It follows in the wake of numerous small energy suppliers that have ceased trading in recent times.
