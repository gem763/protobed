I can report to you that the [finalizing] process is ongoing and nearing completion, and we are working through these issues constructively with both the Department and the FBI. \u2026 After we receive the final classification markings from the Department and the FBI, we will then proceed with our usual process for preparing a final report, including ensuring that appropriate reviews occur for accuracy and comment purposes. Once begun, we do not anticipate the time for that review to be lengthy.\n\nSeveral news outlets obtained Horowitz\u2019s letter. The DOJ IG has been conducting a parallel probe to the one focused on the origins of the Russian collusion hoax, which recently became a criminal investigation. Both investigations are related.\n\nIn March 2018, Horowitz launched the review of FISA abuses at the behest of lawmakers and then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Horowitz examined whether the FBI violated FISA when it sought surveillance of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign aid, back in 2016 in relation to the \u201cRussian collusion\u201d probe.\n\nFox News noted:\n\nPartially redacted versions of the FBI\u2019s FISA warrant to surveil Page revealed that the FBI relied on a largely discredited dossier written by British ex-spy Christopher Steele that was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. But, the FBI apparently obscured that fact in its warrant application, telling the secret court only that the dossier was prepared at the behest of an unidentified presidential campaign.\n\nThe surveillance of Page prompted Trump and his Republican allies to accuse the Obama administration of spying, or even committing treason, against former top law enforcement officials. In April, Attorney General William Barr told lawmakers he believes the FBI spied on the Trump campaign.\n\nBarr is currently reviewing the draft of Horowitz\u2019s report. Horowitz\u2019s investigation is expected to animate congressional hearings and investigations.\n\n\u201cAs soon as Horowitz is done with his review of the FISA warrant application, the counterintelligence investigation, the Trump campaign, we\u2019ll have a hearing in public with Horowitz and we\u2019ll call a bunch of witnesses,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told the Fox Business Network last Sunday.\n\nPresident Trump has been anticipating the DOJ IG\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cThe IG report is going to come out soon, and we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump told reporters last week.\n\n\u201cBut, I predict you will see things that you don\u2019t even believe, the level of corruption \u2026 Let\u2019s see whether or not it\u2019s President Obama. Let\u2019s see whether or not they put that in,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump has the authority to declassify and release the DOJ IG report. Horowitz\u2019s letter announcing the prospective release of the FISA abuse probe report came amid House Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation.", "description": "Horowitz is almost done finalizing the report into possible abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/618-DOJ-IG-Michael-Horowitz-FBI-Christopher-Wray-file-Getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
