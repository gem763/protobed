Oh, and don't forget the rainstorms of interdimensional baby alien squid.\n\nLook closer, though, and the highly anticipated continuation of the seminal 1980s comic book series shows a divided America not unlike our own as it tackles class struggles, systemic racism and white supremacy. And it\u2019s a new \u201cWatchmen\u201d (premiering Sunday, 9 EDT/PDT) that fully embraces the politically charged and completely bonkers spirit of what came before.\n\n\u201cThe world of \u2018Watchmen,\u2019 that comic did not shy away at all,\u201d says star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. The modern followup acts as \"a reminder of our dark history, but also our dark present we're living in and dealing with right now.\u201d\n\nWhat we thought:Review: HBO\u2019s \u2018Watchmen\u2019 wants to end racism, but it\u2019s better at telling superhero stories\n\nBoth the comic and TV version of \u201cWatchmen\u201d (there was also a 2009 film) are alternate histories of the United States, exploring the ripple effects if superheroes were real. In their history, we won the Vietnam War with the help of the supremely powerful Dr. Manhattan and the Asian nation became the 51st state. And Richard Nixon wasn\u2019t taken down by Watergate, but instead nixed term limits and served into the 1980s.\n\nThe HBO series is set 34 years after the events of the comic, which took place in an alternate 1985 and saw World War III staved off by a space squid that landed in New York City and killed 3 million people with a psychic blast. This \u201cWatchmen\u201d begins with the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre and follows that city\u2019s cops, who wear yellow masks to keep their identities secret. They're fighting the terrorist group Seventh Kavalry, a modern version of the Ku Klux Klan clad in the headwear of infamous Watchmen vigilante Rorschach.\n\nInitially, executive producer Damon Lindelof (\u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d \u201cLost\u201d) was concerned about \u201cbeing a cover band, trying to rip off the original \u2018Watchmen.\u2019 \u201d So he aimed to be as original as the \u201880s storyline: Before weaving in elements of the past, the nine-episode first season focuses on Angela Abar (Regina King), a detective who goes by the superhero moniker Sister Night, and other new characters including her husband, Cal Abar (Abdul-Mateen), human lie detector Looking Glass (Tulsa, Oklahoma, native Tim Blake Nelson) and wheelchair-bound mystery man Will Reeves (Louis Gossett Jr.).\n\nOld-school personalities are there, too, and not just Dr. Manhattan on his Martian sojourn. FBI agent Laurie Blake (Jean Smart), an original \"Watchmen\" superhero known as Silk Spectre who now takes down costumed vigilantes, is called to Tulsa and becomes involved in the problems and conspiracies. Enigmatic trillionaire Lady Trieu is also in town, building the equally puzzling Millennium Clock. Then there's the comic's hero-turned-antagonist Adrian Veidt (Jeremy Irons), who's involved in a strange bit of business at bucolic castle estate.\n\nLindelof likens a viewer unfamiliar with the \"Watchmen\" saga to an early follower of Christianity who first hears of Jesus Christ, but finds the New Testament didn\u2019t erase the Old: \u201cEverything that you know is true - Adam and Eve, Noah and the Ark, Daniel in the lion's den, the parting of the Red Sea, all of that stuff happened \u2013 but we want to tell you this new story as well.\u201d\n\nThe seminal \u201cWatchmen\u201d comic is considered sacrosanct by many. \u201cIt really touched me that it's truly adult,\u201d says executive producer Nicole Kassell, who directs the first two episodes. \u201cThere are some very poetic, poignant statements.\u201d\n\nSmart also was unfamiliar with the comic, although her son\u2019s friend \u201cjust about passed out\u201d learning she\u2019d be playing an iconic character. Chau hadn\u2019t heard of it either, leading Lindelof to spend two and a half hours explaining the story. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wait, what's going on?!\u2019 It was a lot to digest.\u201d\n\nIrons is another self-described \u201cWatchmen virgin\u201d who stars as the genius antagonist Adrian, whose bizarre journey in the show borrows from the tale-within-a-tale aspect of the comic. \u201cWe're used to storytelling like this at the moment,\u201d he says. \u201cIt demands quite a lot of the audience, and I think it's interesting.\u201d\n\nThe \"Watchmen\u201d comics deconstructed the popular superheroes of the \u201880s, but Lindelof instead focuses on another central theme, how masks cover one\u2019s face yet also reveal something about identity. \u201cWe all hide little parts of ourselves, even if it's just hiding behind sarcasm,\u201d Smart says.\n\nKing\u2019s main protagonist wears multiple masks \u2013 physical and metaphorical \u2013 and \u201cshe's a representation of just every human being,\u201d the actress says. \u201cWe switch our masks all the time.\u201d\n\nGossett connected to that element, and says \u201cit goes deeper than Damon realized. He touched on something very sensitive. From the end of slavery until now, everybody has had to wear a mask of some sort. Our mutual survival as a people has to do with us dropping those masks, once and for all.\u201d\n\nDigging into issues of the day is also a \u201cWatchmen\u201d hallmark. The original comic wrestled with Cold War paranoia and nuclear fears, so it made sense to Lindelof that race be central to the new series. And \u201cbecause I\u2019m a white guy,\u201d making sure he treated those issues with respect worried and challenged him.\n\n\u201cI can listen to the \u20181619\u2019 podcast or talk about all the Ta-Nehisi Coates books I've read until I'm blue in the face,\u201d Lindelof says. But \u201cwhen I walk into a department store, nobody is following me around. I'm not getting pulled over. But at the same time, I don't think that you can tell any story, fictional or otherwise, that sort of models the realities of living in America today that is not dealing with race. It just comes up in every way, shape and form.\u201d\n\nThe show \u201cis a version of our world, but it also pokes at (the issue of), well, we can end up here,\" King says. \"You can't help but kind of go, \u2018Huh. Did Damon have a crystal ball in some ways?\u201d Angela represents \"the history of black people in America: It's your history, taken away from you and not knowing where you're from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWatchmen\u201d is an alt-history tale, yet its extremes \u201creflect back on us exactly what we're experiencing in America right now in terms of friction points,\u201d says Nelson. It\u2019s the kind of show that examines those points \u201cand demands that, yes, it is worth picking at some of these scars.\u201d", "description": "HBO's 'Watchmen' takes over where the original 1980s comic book left off, taking on political issues of the day and embracing an over-the-top spirit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/16/USAT/068beefe-080c-4c84-ba3a-f2e504d6d75a-5727b8e758301fb13a79426b148c324b603f2a19ee48df96f168e03d8c4ff0a38eecf0c5a74eeba340fa40666ba6afa2.jpg?crop=3999,2249,x0,y0&width=3200&height=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
