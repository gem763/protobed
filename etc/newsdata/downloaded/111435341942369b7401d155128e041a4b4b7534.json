But what was clear was that the physicality of their contests was real.\n\nThe fundamental question of whether the WWE fights are staged or not has been hotly debated in many households and by avid fans of the sport in South Africa and other parts of the world.\n\nOver the years, the WWE fights have graced local television screens and the sport is loved by thousands around the world, especially in the US.\n\nThis was evident as City Press witnessed first-hand fans descending on the 21 000-capacity Staples Centre in Los Angeles last Friday.\n\nThe arena was packed to capacity by fans, who wore T-shirts bearing faces of their favourites.\n\nSome carried replica championship belts. They cheered them on for hours.\n\nThe event was the main attraction.\n\nIt symbolised the historic move to the Fox network on which SmackDown Live will debut as part of the WWE\u2019s 20th anniversary celebrations this year.\n\nWhile fans were filling up the venue, outside legendary wrestlers and newcomers walked the blue carpet, waving to fans while reporters jostled for sound bites.\n\nBlue represents SmackDown\u2019s brand colour and the spectacle was reminiscent of Hollywood\u2019s star-studded show \u2013 the Oscars\u2019 red carpet.\n\nAhead of the main event, the City Press and journalists from other international media houses who were all guests of the WWE, toured the venue.\n\nThis was part of the WWE\u2019s programme to showcase its infrastructure, which makes it possible for such events to be broadcast worldwide.\n\nPart of this huge production includes an engine room known as \u201cGorilla\u201d \u2013 named after wrestling veteran and the WWE Hall of Famer Gorilla Monsoon.\n\nThis engine room gets ferried around the world wherever the WWE hosts events, except in the UK, where a similar structure already exists.\n\nDuring the tour, City Press learnt that fights could be spiced up through the introduction of scenarios when fans appear to be getting bored.\n\nI think it\u2019s anything you want it to be Baron Corbin\n\nIn an attempt to finally put to bed the debate on whether matches are staged or not, this question was posed to several wrestlers.\n\nAmerican wrestler Baron Corbin, who arrogantly refers to himself as King Corbin in the ring, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s anything you want it to be. I think if you believe in it [staged matches] and you buy into what they [performers] are doing and connect emotionally, then it can become real to you.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like a movie. If you are watching a scary movie, an action movie [or] horror movie and [it] changes your heart rate, it makes you move uncomfortabe in your seat like a horror movie or something like that. We are trying to achieve the same thing. We are trying to make people believe and buy into what we are doing and connect emotionally,\u201d Corbin said.\n\nHowever, he said the sport was very physical.\n\nfight outcomes were predetermined but the physical pain was real Titus O\u2019Nei\n\n\u201cMy body gets beat up. Guys have career-ending injuries. We\u2019ve had guys with neck injuries who are no longer able to compete. So, it is very physical, very demanding and we just want people to buy into these stories and connect anyway they can,\u201d Corbin said.\n\nTitus O\u2019Neil said fight outcomes were predetermined but the physical pain was real.\n\n\u201cTry being thrown on top of the table or take a steel chair and bash it on your back and tell me if that hurts or not. What we do is very real, very physical. There is an art to it. It is predetermined. We know who is going to win or lose \u2013 we are in the entertainment business as well, O\u2019Neil said.\n\n\u201cAnd so, it\u2019s sports and entertainment. So, people have to understand when they go to the movie and watch a movie and see somebody dies in a movie and see them walk on the red carpet two days later. Does that mean it was fake or was it art? What we do is art. We do get hurt. You see people get concussions and things like that.\u201d\n\nDrew Gulak said people questioning whether their fights are staged or not need to relax and chill out.\n\n\u201cThere is a reason we are not boxing. There is a reason we are not soccer [players] or UFC [Ultimate Fighting Championship]. It\u2019s because we are better than all of those things and we are more fun to watch.\n\n\u201cAnd if you do engage us I guarantee you will see stuff that you\u2019ve never seen before ... your entire life. And you will feel stuff you\u2019ve never felt before on TV,\u201d Gulak said.\n\nWrestler Bayley \u2013 real name Pamela Rose Martinez \u2013 said it was fine for people to have opinions about the sport.\n\n\u201cBut I think it\u2019s our job as performers to make it look as best as possible and make people believe in what they are watching because what we\u2019re doing is literally putting our lives on the line every single night,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou can ask numerous wrestlers who got hurt in matches. Like I\u2019ve separated a shoulder in a match. Like so many things have happened during matches where people got stopped. It\u2019s something we face every single day and for people to say it doesn\u2019t look good or it\u2019s not real, whatever they want to say to me, it\u2019s kinda like \u2018come here let me show you\u2019.\u201d\n\nHer colleague Lacey Evans said those questioning whether fights were staged or not were missing the point.\n\n\u201cThe chances of them doing what we are able to do are slim to none. I would tell them not to try this at home but do what you can to get in a school and attempt it because what we do is so much more than something that doesn\u2019t look right. We entertain and we bring our A-game at all times.\n\nIt\u2019s metal, it\u2019s wood, it\u2019s fists, it\u2019s body parts. We fight for titles and we fight for entertainment Lacey Evans\n\n\u201cWe go through so many injuries and sore body parts but we are expected to continue to entertain. If they [fans] are so focused on that [whether it\u2019s staged or not] then they need to re-evaluate what it is they are looking at because they are missing the story. They are missing the point. They can\u2019t do what we do, honey,\u201d Evans said.\n\nShe said the physicality of the sport was real.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s metal, it\u2019s wood, it\u2019s fists, it\u2019s body parts. We fight for titles and we fight for entertainment. I mean we could go at it and if they [fans] think that something isn\u2019t real, like I said they are missing the point. They are not looking hard enough. What they are looking for is something that they will never be able to enjoy and see.\u201d\n\nAustralia-born women wrestlers, the IIconics, said everything in the WWE ring was real. Billie Kay and Peyton Royce are tag-team partners.\n\n\u201cWhat you see is exactly what it is. We always get hurt but we are trained professionals. We know how to protect ourselves but accidents do happen all the time. We do our best to put on a good show and entertain the fans and everyone watching all around the world,\u201d said Royce.\n\nSwiss wrestler, Cesaro \u2013 real name is Claudio Castagnoli \u2013 said they were punched for real.\n\n\u201cWe do that close to 200 times a year. It\u2019s sport and entertainment. Just watch and enjoy. It\u2019s like a comic book coming to life. Just enjoy it, it\u2019s fun,\u201d Cesaro said.\n\nMsindisi Fengu was a guest of the WWE\n\nTALK TO US Do you think the World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler should do more to be more convincing?
