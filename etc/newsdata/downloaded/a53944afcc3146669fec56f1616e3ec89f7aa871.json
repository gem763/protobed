Although I reviewed the then-new iPhone XS line, the model I ultimately chose for myself was the \u201clesser\u201d iPhone XR. I chose it mostly for aesthetic reasons. As much as I appreciated its well-rounded technical merits, I was downright giddy at the notion I could have an iPhone in my favorite color: blue. I\u2019ve not once regretted my choice nearly a year later. Color aside, the XR was\u2014and remains\u2014a terrific device.\n\nAt a fundamental level, choosing the iPhone XR was more significant than a favorite color or a willingness to accept some technical differences. As a visually impaired person, foregoing the XS meant I was purposely giving up a pivotal accessibility feature\u2014the OLED screen\u2014that would have made my experience with the device more accessible. In hindsight, the fact I decided on the objectively worse phone in the XR speaks volumes about how great it was as a product, and how color can spark such raw, immense delight.\n\nThis year, there is no blue iPhone. Without the emotional appeal of color in the equation, I\u2019m reminded once again why the best iPhone money can buy\u2014the iPhone 11 Pro Max\u2014is the best, most accessible iPhone for me.\n\nThe Awesomeness of OLED\n\nApple provided me with two review units: one white iPhone 11 and one midnight green iPhone 11 Pro Max. As of this writing, I\u2019ve had both phones for close to two weeks and I\u2019ve spent roughly a week with each phone. I also have my year-old XR handy as a reference tool.\n\nWhile I have spent lengthy time with OLED displays before\u2014my iPhone X had one and, on a much smaller scale, every Apple Watch has had one\u2014coming back after a year with my XR\u2019s Liquid Retina LCD screen was quite literally eye-opening. Even with my poor eyesight, I immediately could notice a substantial difference in quality after putting my XR (and iPhone 11) side by side with the 11 Pro Max. For two years now, Apple has rightfully boasted about the XR\u2019s (now 11) LCD screen being the best in the industry. It is ridiculously good, but the Pro\u2019s OLED display is itself so good that I\u2019ve wondered during testing how I was able to live happily with my XR last year.\n\nIn practice, the Super Retina XDR display on the 11 Pro Max is appreciably better in all phases. In addition to being physically larger (albeit not by much), the 11 Pro Max display\u2019s brightness and sharpness make everything I see on my device much easier. It reduces eye strain and fatigue, which are constant battles for me. iOS 13\u2019s new dark mode looks fantastic on OLED screens; I have it set to automatically switch from light to dark at sundown, and use apps like Twitter and Things in their pitch black modes at nighttime. Although there are dark mode skeptics, I personally find it to be a welcome reprieve during evening hours, and the credit is due to the Pro\u2019s OLED display.\n\nI started my testing with the iPhone 11 Pro Max for a few days, then switched to the regular 11 for another few days. After using both, knowing their respective screen technologies, I instantly knew which model I preferred. I could use the iPhone 11 with no problem, but having access to both phones reaffirmed to me just how superior OLED is for my vision. For my needs, it\u2019s OLED or bust.\n\nThree years with Face ID\n\nI\u2019ve written about my trials with Face ID before. As we collectively enter our third year with Apple\u2019s facial recognition system, I think it\u2019s worth briefly examining where it stands in context of the new iPhones and accessibility.\n\nApple says Face ID in the new iPhones is \u201cup to 30 percent faster\u201d while working from further away and at more angles than before. I cannot tell how much better it is in these regards; it\u2019s Face ID and it seems to work just as well as it ever has. My strabismus still seems to wreak havoc on the phones\u2019 TrueDepth camera system.\n\nI set up Face ID on my 11 Pro Max and turned off Require Attention so that I needn\u2019t look directly at the camera to unlock my phone. (When you do this, Apple blasts a modal alert on screen saying Face ID won\u2019t be as secure as it could be. Fair enough, but it\u2019s a trade-off I have to make in order to use it.) It\u2019s worked like a charm, as usual.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting, though, is what happened when I switched to the regular iPhone 11. I set up Face ID, but forgot to go into Settings and disable Require Attention. I suddenly realized this the other day, as I had clearly forgotten Face ID settings don\u2019t sync from device to device. In hindsight it\u2019s impressive how much Face ID has seemingly improved at recognizing my gaze. Whether it\u2019s purposeful on Apple\u2019s part, I don\u2019t know, but I think it\u2019s telling that I was unlocking my phone and paying for Lyft rides pretty much hassle-free for days with Require Attention on by default.\n\nMy strabismus still makes me an edge case, so I prefer Require Attention be disabled, as it\u2019s the path of least resistance. Yet the happy accident I had regarding Require Attention led to a pleasant surprise. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s directly attributable to this generation of Face ID, but it\u2019s an improvement regardless.\n\nAdieu, 3D Touch\n\nLike the much-maligned Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro, I have long been an ardent supporter of 3D Touch. I wrote about how it could positively impact accessibility when in debuted with the iPhone 6s four years ago, and missed it with my XR.\n\nApple\u2019s removal of 3D Touch lends credence to the cons I outlined in my 2015 piece\u2014namely, that it was too complex (for users and Apple) and it was too undiscoverable. The Apple community at large has felt this way about the feature since the beginning, especially bemoaning how it never percolated across iOS devices, most notably the iPad.\n\niOS 13 has brought Haptic Touch, first introduced with the iPhone XR last year, as a replacement for 3D Touch. It\u2019s more or less equivalent; iOS 13 has expanded Haptic Touch\u2019s scope so as to pick up many of 3D Touch\u2019s tricks. These include Quick Actions on home screen icons and message previews in Mail and Messages. And importantly of course, these features work on iPads running iPadOS.\n\nFrom an accessibility perspective, I have enjoyed having access to these shortcuts again on my iPhone 11 review units. I missed them during my time with the XR until now; the contextual menus throughout the OS really do cut down on excessive swiping and tapping. I like how Apple has grown Haptic Touch for the most part. I cannot tell an appreciable functional difference between it and 3D Touch in terms, say, starting a new email or text message from the home screen.\n\nWhere I believe Haptic Touch is a regression from 3D Touch is in performance. Accessing Quick Actions or link previews, for instance, feels like it takes forever relative to before. It isn\u2019t so bad to the point that it\u2019s unusable, but it\u2019s definitely noticeable. More importantly, it causes Haptic Touch to lose a bit of the luster that makes haptic feedback such a promising assistive technology. Where 3D Touch always felt instantaneous, Haptic Touch, capable as it is, feels slower, thus ruining the fun a little. I assume this latency can and will improve over time, but count me as one who misses 3D Touch in the new iPhones.\n\n[gallery ids=\"1885238,1885228,1885236,1885214,1885218,1885223,1885222\"]\n\nMiscellany\n\nA few cursory notes on the new iPhones worth mentioning.\n\nSIM card swapping. This is an extremely first-world problem, because I am privileged in the sense I get to review new iPhones every year. But this is an accessibility matter! Every year I get a new iPhone (or multiple iPhones) for testing, I\u2019m reminded just how inaccessible the act of swapping my SIM card can be. It is a test of my visual acuity and fine-motor skills, both of which are not strong suits of mine. Especially on the midnight green, where the finish is so dark on the sides I can hardly see where the SIM tray is, moving between three iPhones can be quite adventurous. (I remember the jet black iPhone 7 having the same issue in terms of finding the SIM tray.) I like that Apple provides users with the SIM tool; the SIM card dance isn\u2019t their fault. Still, as a visually impaired reviewer, I felt compelled to share this bit of accessibility minutia.\n\nColor. Speaking of color, I do like the new midnight green finish a lot. The CW\u2019s Arrow is my favorite television show, and the shade of green strikes me as the iPhone Oliver Queen would choose.\n\nBattery life. One of the iPhone 11\u2019s biggest selling points is the dramatically increased battery life. I\u2019ve long compromised my battery\u2014on an iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch\u2014because I need to run my devices with maximum screen brightness in order to see. That I can do so on iPhone 11 and still mostly benefit from the battery gains speaks volumes about Apple\u2019s battery work. I can go a whole day, using my phone normally at max brightness, and not stress about conserving my battery or finding an outlet somewhere.\n\nPortrait (pig?) Mode. Seriously, Portrait Mode on the new iPhones was made for pigs.\n\nPortrait Mode on iPhone 11 was made for pigs.

Yes, it was beautifully blue, but it was also a damn good all-around iPhone. Apple describes the iPhone 11 as having \u201cjust the right amount of everything,\u201d the iPhone for everyone, but that tagline could just as easily apply to the XR. Even today, the XR is a great phone if you can do without the second camera. The iPhone 11 is simply a better iPhone XR.\n\nThe iPhone 11 and 11 Pro are close enough, spec-wise, that if it the regular 11 came in blue, I might\u2019ve been tempted to upgrade to that. There\u2019s a reason Apple offers iPhones in a rainbow of colors; the psychological impact color has on consumerism is a very real phenomena. Perhaps someday soon there will be a blue iPhone with a Super Retina OLED display. That said, while both iPhones are highly impressive, I\u2019m happy with the Pro for the upgraded screen quality and three cameras. You really can\u2019t go wrong with either iPhone 11, but for this year anyway, the return to OLED was the clincher for me.", "description": "Last year\u2019s iPhone was an outlier for me.
