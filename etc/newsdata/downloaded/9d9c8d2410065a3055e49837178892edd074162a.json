Why aren\u2019t Trudeau\u2019s troubles helping the far right?", "language": "en", "text": "But Bernier\u2019s People\u2019s Party of Canada (PPC) is polling at between 1 and 5 percent of the vote. Even if the PCC wins a few seats in the next parliament, as some predict, it is more likely to remain a flash party, successful in one or two elections, than to become a strong and stable far right presence in the Canadian political system.\n\nThis is not because Canada is immune to populist or far-right politics. As I argue in my new book The Far Right Today, no country is immune to the far right. Since the turn of the century, many countries once deemed immune have seen far-right parties and politicians break through electorally, including Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United States.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut breaking into office does not always build a stable and strong far-right party. Whether such a party grows or fades depends on both political demand and supply. Neither looks particularly strong in Canada.\n\nHere\u2019s what Bernier\u2019s party is offering\n\nBernier founded the PPC in September 2018, after he failed to win leadership of the mainstream Conservative Party of Canada (CPC). Upon quitting the CPC, Bernier kept his seat in parliament, where he has represented French-speaking Quebec\u2019s Beauce district since 2006. The PPC is not much more than Bernier\u2019s personal vehicle; its first party conference, this August, attracted roughly 500 people.\n\nIts party policies resemble those of the traditional U.S. Republican Party more than those of President Trump or European far right parties like Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Assembly (RN) in France. The PPC is very pro-market, supporting lower taxes and more privatizations of state companies; it\u2019s skeptical about climate change; and it advocates a noninterventionist foreign policy and phasing out development aid. While its positions on immigration and multiculturalism seem relatively moderate, they all come with a harsh twist. For example, the party wants to limit immigration to maximum 150,000 people per year, which is pretty generous compared to other nations\u2019 totals, per capita \u2014 but it also wants to build \u201cborder fences\u201d at popular ports of entry. And while it claims to support multiculturalism, the PPC wants to \u201crepeal the Multiculturalism Act and eliminate all funding to promote multiculturalism.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there\u2019s not much demand for these offerings\n\nAs Emma Ambrose and I argued in our 2015 article \u201cCanadian Multiculturalism and the Absence of the Far Right,\u201d Canadians aren\u2019t especially interested in far right politics. Canada has long had a selective immigration policy, giving it an immigrant population that\u2019s fundamentally different from that of most other western democracies. Most notably, immigrants in Canada are higher educated and therefore better employed and paid than immigrants in other countries, which means that \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d arguments, i.e. that immigrants are an economic burden upon the host population, are less salient.\n\nThe immigrant population is also much more diverse in origin, which means that it is not dominated by one or two groups, such as Turks in Germany or Mexicans in the U.S., which can be seen as a growing unified minority \u201cthreatening\u201d the decreasing \u201cnative\u201d majority. And unlike in most West European countries, Muslims constitute only a minority of the immigrant population, which means that \u201cimmigrants\u201d are not conflated with \u201cMuslims\u201d in political and public debate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs a consequence, few Canadians feel either of the two key motivations for voters of far right parties: economic anxiety or cultural backlash. In fact, although Canada has one of the highest percentages of foreign-born populations, Canadians have much more positive attitudes toward immigration and immigrants than citizens in other western democracies. In a recent Pew Research Center poll, 68 percent of Canadians said immigrants make their country stronger \u2014 the highest percentage of the 18 countries polled.\n\nCanada\u2019s official policy promoting multiculturalism goes back 50 years\n\nThis is strengthened by the country\u2019s official policy of multiculturalism. Introduced in 1971 by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, the father of the current prime minister, multiculturalism was primarily aimed at lessening tensions between French-speaking Quebec and the English-speaking rest of Canada. Since then, Canadian multiculturalism has been unique in both the comprehensiveness of the policy and the political commitment to the policy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPart of that commitment is a kind of enforced support that has become increasingly unique too. Political elites in many West European countries strictly controlled the immigration issue in the late 20th century, limiting and at times even keeping it from the public debate, and excluding or shaming overt negative voices. But Canada is one of the few countries that continues to do so. It has one of the highest scores in terms of promoting and upholding anti-discrimination policy. Consecutive governments have taken an active and hard stance against hate speech and hate crimes.\n\nSome recent cracks have begun to show in Canada\u2019s multiculturalism. The country has a growing right-wing media system that, largely copying its much bigger and more influential brethren in the U.S., are pushing out nativist and populist propaganda. This includes prominent columnists in mainstream conservative media like the Toronto Sun as well as openly far-right outlets like The Rebel Media. But Canadian cultural support for welcoming immigrants remains effective and influential, as shown by the recent outrage over an \u201canti-diversity\u201d opinion piece in the Vancouver Sun, which the paper pulled in response.\n\nToday, Canada\u2019s mainstream parties still dominate politics. Those parties prioritize socioeconomic issues over sociocultural ones. They discuss mitigating climate change rather than far-right issues like crime, identity and immigration. This leaves little space for far right politics, particularly from a one-man band. So even if the PPC enters parliament, it\u2019s not likely to be the beginning of a far-right dawn.\n\nCas Mudde (@casmudde) is Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF Professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia and a Professor II at the Center for Research on Extremism (C-REX) at the University of Oslo.
