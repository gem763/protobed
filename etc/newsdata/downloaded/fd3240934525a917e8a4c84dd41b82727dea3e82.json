Each side blames the other for having mismanaged the project.\n\nIn April 2017, the body responsible for managing the concert hall sent a bill of 170.6 million euros to the architect, which included penalties for late delivery.\n\nFor Ateliers Jean Nouvel, this claim was \u201ctotally disproportionate not only in the absolute but also relative to the sums that were actually received\u201d by the architect, which according to the legal document seen by AFP came to 12 million euros.\n\nNouvel\u2019s lawyers, William Bourdon and Vincent Brengarth, said the claim against their client was all the more unusual for the fact that the concert hall was targeting only the architect and no other business involved in the project.\n\nThe Philharmonie was knowingly going after funds it knew were not owed, they argued.\n\nNouvel and the Philharmonie have been in engaged in a very public war of words in the media and the courts since the concert hall\u2019s inauguration.\n\nNouvel refused to attend the event, insisting that work on the building was not ready.\n\nAt the time Nouvel, who won architecture\u2019s top global award, the Pritzker Prize, in 2008, wrote a lengthy complaint about the affair published in the daily Le Monde.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Top architect Jean Nouvel is suing one of his former clients, the Philharmonie concert hall in Paris, in a dispute over the cost of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/918388_architect-jean-nouvel-refused-attend-2015-opening-philharmonie-concert-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
