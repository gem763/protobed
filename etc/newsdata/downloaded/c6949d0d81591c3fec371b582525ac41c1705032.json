In response, local officials have resorted to urging volunteers to aid the cleanup mission.\n\nVideos of volunteers' inefficient attempts to clean up the spills have been met with ridicule on social media. Online commentators have shared footage of locals equipped with little more than rubber gloves and rudimentary fishing nets battling the huge environmental disaster, questioning why the government has not offered a coordinated national response.\n\nThis week Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, the country's vice president, announced he was dispatching 5,000 troops to the northeast to give more \u201cmore visibility\u201d to the government's response.", "description": "Brazil has deployed 5,000 troops to its beaches amid mounting fury at the government's inaction over the worst oil spill in the country's history.", "authors": ["Rozina Sabur", "Rupert Christiansen", "Allister Heath"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/7FcBsWuP_mE/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
