We know from the pilot back in 2018 that voter fraud was inconsequential, whilst what the pilot did do was turn away a disproportionate number of vulnerable voters.\n\n\n\n\"Boris Johnson is clearly taking a leaf out of Trump's playbook by using false claims about voter fraud to suppress turnout.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe trial was deemed a waste of time and the public\u2019s money, and this roll-out will be no different. The Conservative Government have already showed disdain for our democracy and this move is simply further confirmation of that.\n\n\n\n\u201cRather than electioneering by making it harder to vote, the Conservative Government should be focusing on ways to encourage democratic participation, such as through extending voting rights to 16 year olds.\u201d\n\nA Government source told the Telegraph: \u201cA secure electoral system is vital. By changing the law to require voters to show some ID, as they do in many other daily activities, and taking steps to cut down proxy and postal voter fraud, we can ensure that everyone's vote counts and strengthen public trust in our democracy.\u201d\n\nSources said voters without the required documentation would be able to apply for a free \u201celectoral ID\u201d from their local council.", "description": "The PM is planning to make showing photo ID compulsory in order to vote", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20570272.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Local-Election-2018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
