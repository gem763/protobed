Just answer it! She replies to the question by changing the subject.\n\nEzekiel Kweku: She\u2019s going to give this exact same answer every time\n\nEd: I think she keeps saying \u201ctaxes will go up, but costs will go down more\u201d without serving up a sound bite.\n\nEzekiel: I just feel like we get where the candidates stand on this issue\n\nBen: I think Buttigieg calling her out on her waffling is an effective line of attack\n\nEzekiel: I don\u2019t see anything wrong with her answer tbh\n\nEd: Pete\u2019s attack was telegraphed by his new ad, which is why he was really lucky they asked the same damn question for the fifth time.\n\nJeb Reed: They\u2019ll keep asking it! as they should\n\nSarah Jones: It shouldn\u2019t be that predictable\n\nEric: Guess Warren is not pivoting to \u201cMedicare For All Who Want It\u201d in the general.\n\nEd: She\u2019s not going to say her plan will raise taxes. Media and Republicans are going to go nuts over this.\n\nBen: With the usual caveat that this stuff ends up not mattering much, I don\u2019t think this is good for Warren.\n\nMargaret Hartmann: Bernie\u2019s answer was way clearer\n\nJeb: Yeah, i\u2019m not sure refusing to say the word taxes really helps at a certain point.\n\nEzekiel:My political geiger counter is not going off.\n\nSarah: I think she\u2019s been fine, but Bernie has the benefit of years of consistency on this subject\n\nJeb: I still don\u2019t get why she\u2019s so risk averse on the word taxes, but not risk averse on saying she\u2019ll ban private insurance.\n\nJon: It\u2019s extremely unpopular to raise taxes on the middle class!\n\nEd: Klobuchar does Warren a favor by changing the subject.\n\nBen: Klobuchar is doing well, and she\u2019s right that this endless debate over M4A/taxes misses many of the points\n\nAdam: I guess all of the time spent on this means Warren really is the front runner.\n\nJosh: The only reason there is this tiresome effort over and over to get Warren to answer this question is that the consistently refuses to answer it\n\nBen: Precisely.\n\nEzekiel: Okay, but I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s not worth it.\n\nEzekiel: Who is it about?\n\nEd: She actually does answer it implicitly, but I agree she shouldn\u2019t do this.\n\nBen: It\u2019s about Josh.\n\nJosh: I think we can infer from the fact that she is so insistent on not answering the question that a lot of people would be interested in the answer. If people didn\u2019t care she\u2019d answer the question so reporters would stop bothering her about it.\n\nEzekiel: I don\u2019t think we can. The cost to her not answering the question is not that high.\n\nJosh: We know exactly what Warren doing: She wants to compete with Bernie for leftist voters who care about Medicare for all without taking any responsibility for the unpopular things she would have to do to get it implemented.It is frankly dishonest. Although the main direction the dishonesty goes is that she knows the financing is too unpopular to get done, yet she is pretending she will implement single payer.\n\nShe\u2019s not lying to me. She\u2019s lying to socialists. Whereas Bernie forthrightly intends to make a forthright run at single payer (which he will lose)\n\nEric: The thing is, she\u2019s also embraced a ton of really unpopular stuff forthrightly. Decriminalizing border enforcement/reparations/a fracking ban \u2013 all more unpopular than M4A when taxes are mentioned, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\n\nSarah: Fracking ban is way more unpopular.\n\nEzekiel: There\u2019s not going to be a Medicare For All bill on her desk to sign in the first place.\n\nBen: Yes, the fact that there\u2019s a 0.0% chance of this happening does take something away from the conversation.", "description": "Intelligencer staffers discuss whether her refusal to say whether her health care plan will entail a tax increase", "authors": ["Intelligencer Staff"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/22/22-elizabeth-warren-iowa.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
