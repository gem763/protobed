Clinicians at France\u2019s network of public sperm banks (CECOS) said the supply of cryopreserved sperm only just meets demand.\n\nMoreover, they predict lifting donor anonymity could prompt three-quarters of registered male and female donors to deny clinics the use of their sperm and eggs under the new rules.\n\n\u201cTo say \u2018everything is going to be ok\u2019 would be burying your head in the sand,\u201d Nathalie Rives, president of the CECOS federation, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThere will be a period of instability, with increased demand and the need to recruit new donors. We don\u2019t know how long this instability will last and whether there will be a shortage.\u201d\n\nThe bioethics bill, which would also allow women to freeze their eggs for non-medical reasons to enhance their chances of having children, is Macron\u2019s first major societal reform.\n\nMedically assisted reproduction - such as IVF - is widely available to all women in countries such as Britain, Belgium, Spain. But in France, it has fed into a broader debate about the commercialization of healthcare and gay rights.\n\n\u201cThe right to know one\u2019s origins is a vital right, a fundamental right,\u201d said Arthur Kermalvezen, 35, who turned to DNA tests to track down his biological father and has campaigned for the lifting of anonymity.\n\nThe legalisation of gay marriage in France six years ago sparked massive street protests even though the influence of the Catholic Church was thought to be in decline.\n\nIn a sign France has become more socially liberal, polls show a majority of French people back the bioethics reform.\n\nFrozen vials of sperm are seen preserved in an azote cooled container in a laboratory in Paris, France, September 13, 2019. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann\n\nProfessor Rachel Levy, who runs the CECOS centre at the Tenon Hospital in Paris, said donor anonymity would remain in place for 13 months after the legislation comes into effect in an effort to help sperm banks build up stocks.\n\nThere would then be a second phase during which existing donors would say if they consent to their cryopreserved sperm being used under the new rules. The samples of those who refuse will be destroyed later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenging situation,\u201d Levy said.", "description": "France risks a shortage of frozen sperm if lawmakers approve new legislation that allows single women and lesbian couples access to in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and abolishes the right of sperm and egg donors to keep their identities secret, clinicians said.", "authors": ["Marine Pennetier", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433293709&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0R4", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
