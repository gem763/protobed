To combat inequality, you want to soak the rich and distribute the cash to the poor, and claim journalists think that the rich must be bribed by tax breaks to function. You contest our conviction that fast GDP growth is an excellent antidote to poverty.\n\nLet me respond. You say evidence in your new book shows corporate tax cuts alone won\u2019t boost investment. Is that different from what some of us have said? This column told the finance minister: \u201cYour gamble of cutting corporate tax will succeed only as part of an overall strategy to make India more competitive. You must convince your Cabinet colleagues to make other inputs like land, labour, railway freight rates and electricity as cheap in India as in neighbouring Asian competitors. Cutting taxes rates alone will not suffice.\u201d\n\nYou question our claim that global investors are shifting from China to Vietnam and Bangladesh but not India because of our higher tax rates and input prices. You say better evidence comes from the US where different states levy different tax rates and yet high-tax states grow fast. However, the main US business taxes are federal and apply to all states. Second, states with huge historical advantages \u2014 California has Silicon Valley, New York is a global financial centre \u2014 can get away with high taxes because their lucrative giant industries will not shift. But smaller entrepreneurs have shifted in droves from California to low-tax Texas. Finally, American states compete fiercely with tax breaks to attract big projects, like Amazon\u2019s second headquarters. US evidence actually proves that tax rates matter hugely.\n\nWe journalists favour a tough tax administration that jails hundreds of crooked politicians and businessmen. That will improve tax revenue and equality far more than uncompetitive high taxes.\n\nDo high taxes reduce inequality? Indira Gandhi raised the top income tax rate to 97.75%, along with a 3.5% wealth tax. That reduced inequality, but also created a massive black economy and entrenched the pathetic Hindu growth rate of just 3.5%. Between 1947 and 1980, India\u2019s population virtually doubled while the poverty ratio stayed unchanged. So, the number of poor people almost doubled in the era of high taxes and falling inequality. By contrast fast GDP growth (with rising inequality) in the 2000s reduced poverty rapidly.\n\nYou say Scandinavian countries with high tax rates have grown fast. Voters in those well-governed countries trust politicians to use tax money well. If Indian politicians had as good a track record, surely the case for higher tax-and-spend would be stronger. Alas, Indian politicians claiming to be Robin Hoods have used socialist controls and high taxes to line their pockets and build patronage networks. Maharashtra chief minister\n\nA R Antulay got builders to donate to his charitable trusts in return for contracts. It\u2019s like Fagin\u2019s song in the musical \u201cOliver\u201d:\n\n\u201cRobin Hood, what a crook,\n\nGave a bit of what he took.\n\nCharity\u2019s fine, subscribe to mine,\n\nI\u2019ve got to pick a pocket or two.\u201d\n\nYou want to raise tax rates and give more to the poor. Don\u2019t politicians do that already? The peak income tax rate is up from 30% in 1997 to 42.7% today. This helped finance the PM Kisan Scheme \u2014 Rs 6,000 per year to all farmers. State schemes in Telangana, Odisha and Jharkhand offer even larger sums.\n\nEvery state election brings new freebies. Jayalalithaa won in Tamil Nadu promising free cellphones; laptops for students; maternity assistance of Rs 18,000; free 100 units of electricity every two months; waiver of all farm loans; fisherfolk assistance of Rs 5,000; 50% subsidy for women on mopeds or scooters; eight-gram gold coins for women getting married; and much more. Jayalalithaa earlier provided 20 kilos of free rice per family, a free mixer-grinder and fan per family, subsidised Amma kitchens, and subsidised goats or cows for rural families.\n\nYet this combination of higher taxes and bigger freebies has not created an egalitarian utopia. The recent cut in corporate taxes is an attempt to find another way forward, but will work only with many supplementary reforms.\n\nYou are reported to have discussed but not designed Rahul Gandhi\u2019s NYAY proposal, giving Rs 6,000 a month to the bottom fifth of the population. One report says you felt Rs 2,500 a month might be the maximum possible without killing fiscal discipline. Well, many of us financial journalists have long favoured converting India\u2019s many leaky subsidies into cash transfers that would exceed Rs 2,500 a month.
