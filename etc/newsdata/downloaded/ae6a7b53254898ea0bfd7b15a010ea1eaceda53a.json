Or at least, anti-investing-more-in-bonds. On the other side, there are the \u201cyes, but\u201d folks. They get why it\u2019s important but don\u2019t take action because they don\u2019t know where to start.\n\nIf you are in the latter camp, let me tell you how you should build a bond portfolio. The best way to build a bond portfolio is to start by thinking about the risks. A portfolio of bonds can go down, you know.\n\nRead: Don\u2019t dump stocks \u2014 here\u2019s why\n\nYes, I know that U.S. Treasuries cannot technically default (or at least, they haven\u2019t so far). But their price can go down, and substantially. For example, if long-term interest rates go up a lot \u2014 say, 2% or so \u2014 the price of a 30-year Treasury bond TMUBMUSD30Y, +0.41% could drop by as much as 40%. That\u2019s a scary number.\n\nMost people aren\u2019t worried about that right now. They may be some day.\n\nSo the first consideration is the direction of interest rates, known as duration risk. For U.S. Treasury bonds, that is pretty much the only risk.\n\nFor other types of bonds, there are other risks. Corporate bonds can and do default. They haven\u2019t in a while, but they will some day. More important, the price of these bonds will decline as the market perceives companies to be less creditworthy.\n\nThis is known as spread widening. The spread between corporate interest rates and Treasury interest rates will widen.\n\nIn the last credit meltdown in 2015, led by energy credits, high-yield spreads widened to about 700 basis points over Treasuries. That\u2019s a bunch of gobbledygook to many people. What does that mean to me as an investor in a bond mutual fund?\n\nWell, if you own a high-quality, investment-grade corporate bond fund, the most it can probably go down because of credit concerns is about 5%-7%. If it is a fund that is concentrated in BBB credits, perhaps a bit more.\n\nIf you own a high-yield bond fund that focuses on BBB credits, your downside is probably capped at around 20%. If it owns mostly speculative CCC credits, you could lose 30% or more. This is also true for convertible bond funds.\n\nWith international bonds, it is very much dependent on the situation, but emerging market bonds tend to be very economically sensitive and the downside could be large if we have a global recession.\n\nMortgage-backed securities are pretty boring most of the time, except in 2008, or if interest rates rise rapidly.\n\nOne day, municipal bonds will be very, very exciting. Although people have been saying that for 15 years or more.\n\nNow that we know the risks, let\u2019s build a portfolio.\n\nRead: The more Trump tweets, the worse it is for stocks, research finds\n\nReach for safety\n\nWhat is your income? If it is north of $300,000 or so, you will want to consider owning lots of municipal bonds.\n\nYes, I\u2019ve heard all the arguments against munis \u2014 unfunded public pensions leading to muni bond defaults, blah, blah, blah. Maybe that is an issue in the next recession. Maybe not.\n\nFor the rest of the portfolio, you will want a mix of Treasury and corporate bonds. With yields this low, people are tempted to massively overweight corporates. I understand that sentiment.\n\nBy the way, one thing that is poorly understood about investment-grade corporate bonds is that they are also very sensitive to interest rates. When Apple AAPL, -1.46% issued its first bonds in 2013, people were surprised to see 10% of the value evaporate in a month \u2014 all on duration.\n\nHigh-yield bonds have a little exposure to interest rates (especially with the low coupons these days), but not much. Mostly, they are correlated with stocks.\n\nSo:\n\n\u2022 Treasury \u2014 all interest-rate risk.\n\n\u2022 Investment-grade corporates \u2014 some credit risk, some interest-rate risk.\n\n\u2022 High-yield corporates \u2014 mostly credit risk (they behave like stocks).\n\nI don\u2019t have a rubric here for what you should do, but your instincts on this \u2014 to overweight corporates to get more yield \u2014 are probably bad. This is actually the wrong time to be reaching for yield.\n\nIt\u2019s the right time to be reaching for safety. Had you done so eight months ago, you would be pretty happy today. Treasury bonds are up over 20% this year.\n\nMaturity matching\n\nThe other thing you need to consider when building a bond portfolio is the length of maturity you want.\n\n\u2022 Short-term bonds = less interest-rate risk and less credit risk.\n\n\u2022 Long-term bonds = more interest-rate risk and more credit risk.\n\nYou could just do it naively and pick a range of maturities. I\u2019m not going to talk about it here, but you might want to do some research on bond laddering. The idea is to spread your risk along the interest-rate curve.\n\nThe school of thought is that you want to match your bond maturities with your liabilities. If you are going to retire in 30 years, you probably want 30-year bonds. If you are going to send a child to college in 10 years, you probably want 10-year bonds.\n\nIf you have a view on interest rates, that can help. For example, I think the Federal Reserve is likely to cut rates to zero and beyond. This would make shorter maturities more attractive.\n\nOnce you put together your portfolio, you can figure out the weighted average maturity. A typical bond portfolio has a weighted average maturity of five to seven years. If you are worried about interest rates or credit, you can make it shorter, or vice versa.\n\nMore art than science\n\nThe key here is diversification. A portfolio full of municipal bonds will expose you to, well, the idiosyncratic risk that muni credit blows up.\n\nAnd yes, this is more art than science. And I know it\u2019s not straightforward. One of my readers said this recently: \u201cI went into bonds hoping to ease up on time needed on my portfolio, but now I think shares are simpler!\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong.\n\nBut the bond market is much larger than the stock market. For many reasons, it is not clever to avoid it altogether.\n\nJared Dillian is an investment strategist at Mauldin Economics and a former head of ETF trading at Lehman Brothers.
