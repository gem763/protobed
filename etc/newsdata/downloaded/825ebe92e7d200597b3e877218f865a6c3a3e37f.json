Mr. Quinn, who suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is almost completely paralyzed. To speak, write, change the television channel or turn on the lights in his Yonkers, N.Y., home, he flicks his eyes over a computer screen. The device has an infrared camera below the display; he can \u201cclick\u201d on files, links or letters on a keyboard by looking at them.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how patients remained active without this. I use it every second I am awake,\u201d said Mr. Quinn, 36, through a voice synthesizer. Mr. Quinn works as an advocate for patients with ALS; in 2014, he co-created the \u201cIce Bucket Challenge,\u201d a viral social-media campaign that raised $115 million for research into ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, according to the ALS Association.\n\nMr. Quinn\u2019s device is one example of how eye-tracking technology is surfacing in the medical field. Health care professionals are beginning to use it to teach medical students, improve surgeries and diagnose issues such as nearsightedness. One day, the technology may even help treat eye diseases.", "description": "Startups are using technology that follows the movement of the eye to diagnose nearsightedness and help people with disabilities.", "authors": ["David M.
