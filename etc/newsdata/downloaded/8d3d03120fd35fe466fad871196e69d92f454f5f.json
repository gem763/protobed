While the costumes definitely made me rather hot under the collar during promo, the characters\u2019 voices that were dubbed over the singers throughout the episode left me with permanent nightmares.\n\nAs always, Twitter most definitely had something to say, so let\u2019s get that out of the way before we talk about the show\u2019s saving grace, Ms Lindsay Lohan\u2026\n\nI\u2019d better see one of the #maskedsingerau contestants unmasked to reveal all five members of Bardot huddled together \u2014 Nick Bond (@bondnickbond) September 23, 2019\n\nGREAT. LINDSAY TIME.\n\nI'm looking forward to Linday Lohan saying random Aussie celebrity names she read on wikipedia on the flight over. #MaskedSingerAU \u2014 keegs (@keegs) September 23, 2019\n\nWe are simply undeserving of such a knowledgable, cultured queen.\n\nWe knew that it\u2019d be a huge ask to expect Lindsay to be familiar with any Australian celebrities, but she gave it a red-hot crack. And that\u2019s not even meaning to be shady\u2026 Like, I\u2019m really in admiration of my girl out here pretending to know these people.\n\nThe internet unanimously agrees that this is some of LiLo\u2019s finest acting work to date.\n\nGive the Emmy to Lindsay Lohan for her performance as person who knows Australian celebrities. #MaskedSingerAU \u2014 Kara Schlegl (@karaschlegl) September 23, 2019\n\nLindsay Lohan trying to figure out who Gretel Killeen is #MaskedSingerAU pic.twitter.com/CzEhYlQbzS \u2014 GRACE (@GraceGarde) September 23, 2019\n\nThis is the best acting lindsay\u2019s given us since the parent trap. #MaskedSingerAU \u2014 MITCH CHURI (@MitchChuri) September 23, 2019\n\nLindsay pretending to know Gretel is me bumping into a guy I supposedly met at the clubs at 5AM the Saturday prior \u2013 there\u2019s simply never going to be any recollection there but we don\u2019t want them to feel bad because we\u2019re super nice and accomodating like that. Love that for us.\n\nI\u2019m definitely going to be tuning in for the rest of the season, but primarily because I want to see the various ways queen Lohan politely lies her way out of knowing anyone on the show ever. And you bet she\u2019ll do it. She\u2019s amazing like that.", "description": "We knew it'd be a huge ask to expect Lindsay Lohan to be familiar with any Australian celebrities for Masked Singer, but she gave it a red-hot crack", "authors": ["Louis Hanson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/lindsay-lohan-the-masked-singer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
