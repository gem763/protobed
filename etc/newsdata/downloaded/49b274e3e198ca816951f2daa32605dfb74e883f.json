That is a somewhat novel finding,\" says Dr. Robert H. Pass, director of pediatric cardiology at the Mt Sinai Kravis Children's Hospital.\n\nWhat does this mean for prospective parents?\n\n\"I don't think that from one study that we can definitively make recommendations,\" Pass said. \"However, this study supports previous studies that alcohol is bad for women who are pregnant.\" He added that this study is also \"highly suggestive of the father's effect on fetal outcomes.\"\n\nHowever, Pass was hesitant about changing current medical practices. He said meta-analyses \"can sometimes be very helpful, but there are many limitations. Sometimes the data is not 100% accurate.\"\n\nPass believes that more research is needed, especially surrounding a father's health.\n\nQin agreed that we need to know more. For example, he thinks we should explore how alcohol use increases heart disease in children. He also acknowledged the limitations associated with a meta-analysis and hopes that future studies will be designed differently in order to further support the results of his research.\n\n(MORE: In an alcohol-heavy culture, more people look for booze-free spaces)\n\nAlcohol isn't the only thing that negatively impacts a father's impact on his child's health.\n\n\"We know that advanced paternal age is associated with a number of different risks for fetuses,\" Pass said.\n\nDr. Deidre Downs Gunn, a reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist and medical director of the IVF program at the University of Alabama-Birmingham Medical Center said: \"In addition to alcohol use, there are a number of factors that can impact sperm quality and reproductive health in men. Smoking, marijuana use, obesity or poor nutrition, certain medications, and especially testosterone use- all of these can affect a man's ability to have children.\"\n\nOverall, this study illustrates the importance of preconception counseling for mothers and fathers.\n\n\"This study is an example of why we need to have a conversation about men's preconception health, not just women's, to improve the chance of a healthy pregnancy and baby,\" Gunn said.\n\nTulsie N.
