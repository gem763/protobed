The news, first reported by The New York Times, was confirmed to The Verge in a statement from Verizon-owned media conglomerate Oath, to which Tumblr belongs, following a dizzying string of mergers and acquisitions over the last four years.\n\n\u201cDavid Karp will depart Oath by the end of the year,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cDavid founded Tumblr 10 years ago as a space for the world\u2019s creators, and we thank him for his commitment and passion driving the growth of the platform to almost 380 million blogs and over 155 billion posts.\u201d\n\nSince 2013, Tumblr has been a property of Yahoo following a $1.1 billion acquisition that put the social network and Karp, still its CEO, under the guidance of then-Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer. Four years later, Yahoo was sold to Verizon in a deal that was finalized earlier this year with Mayer\u2019s departure back in June, making Karp a Verizon employee as part of a combination of AOL and Yahoo\u2019s assets that came to be called Oath.\n\nThe many corporate reshuffles may be why Karp has finally stepped down, although it\u2019s unclear exactly why he\u2019s leaving the company or what he plans to do now. According to the statement, Tumblr Chief Operating Officer Jeff D\u2019Onofrio is taking over for Karp. An Oath spokesperson later confirmed that D\u2019Onofrio will lead Tumblr going forward as its permanent CEO.\n\nKarp, in a note sent to his colleagues at Tumblr, says the \u201cdecision comes after months of reflection on my personal ambitions, and at no cost to my hopefulness for Tumblr\u2019s future or the impact I know it can have.\u201d He goes on to say, \u201cThe internet is at a crossroads of which this team can play a fundamental role in shaping.\u201d\n\nLetter I just sent to my team \u2665\ufe0f https://t.co/3Vsv3ROuhf \u2014 David Karp (@davidkarp) November 27, 2017\n\nRegardless of his underlying motives, Karp\u2019s resignation marks the end of an era for Tumblr, which became a blogging juggernaut and home to the internet\u2019s more idiosyncratic personalities during the mainstream and meticulously corporate rise of Facebook. Over the years and under Karp\u2019s leadership, Tumblr offered a platform to writers, artists, other creators with a unique penchant for fandom and a peculiar and unique aesthetic, giving those voices a place to express themselves, find a following \u2014 and occasionally go viral in ways reminiscent of the earliest days of web blogging.\n\nUpdate at 4:08PM ET, 11/27: Clarified that Tumblr COO David D\u2019Onofrio will be Tumblr\u2019s new, permanent CEO now that Karp is leaving.", "description": "Moving on to greener pastures not owned by Verizon", "authors": ["Nick Statt", "Nov"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LcdaTB98mHd7WXgXM9GNAWpAvSM=/0x0:3576x1872/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9759371/490098257.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2017-11-27"}
