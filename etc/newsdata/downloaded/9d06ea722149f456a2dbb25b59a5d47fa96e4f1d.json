About 312,000 electric customers remained without power as of 10 p.m. officials said.\n\nSome of the state\u2019s most devastating wildfires were sparked in recent years by damage to electrical transmission lines from high winds, with flames then spreading through tinder-dry vegetation to populated areas.\n\nNewsom, a Democrat, told a news conference on Thursday he did not fault the utility for shutting off electricity as a safety measure, but he described the outage as too broad and said it resulted from years of mismanagement by the utility.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a scale and scope of something that no state in the 21st century should experience,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is unacceptable and it\u2019s happened because of neglect.\u201d\n\nThe remarks were the most pointed comments Newsom has directed at PG&E since the outages began early on Wednesday. Among the questions he raised was whether the utility was too large, with a service area covering more than 40 counties.\n\nHe also faulted PG&E for putting what he called \u201cgreed\u201d ahead of investments in its infrastructure to protect the electrical grid from dangerous winds.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment.\n\nPG&E Chief Executive Bill Johnson acknowledged that his company had left \u201cmillions of people\u201d without a \u201cfundamental service\u201d they expect and deserve.\n\n\u201cThis is not how we want to serve you,\u201d he told a media briefing in San Francisco, adding that PG&E \u201cwas not adequately prepared\u201d for such a large power outage.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Downtown Los Angeles is seen behind an electricity pylon through the morning marine layer in Los Angeles, California, U.S., August 20, 2019.

The fires in that region killed 46 people.\n\n\u201cThose fires and what they caused are still very real for people in our \u2018hood,\u201d he said.", "description": "California Governor Gavin Newsom called a widespread electricity shutdown triggered by a power company to prevent wildfires \"unacceptable\", as gale-force winds and dry weather posed a critical fire threat to the north of the state.", "authors": ["Alex Dobuzinskis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439469621&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF992DI", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
