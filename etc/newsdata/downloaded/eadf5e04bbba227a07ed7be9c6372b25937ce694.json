(Murad Sezer/Reuters)\n\nThe Turkish military struck targets on the Syria-Iraq border on Tuesday in preparation for an offensive into the northeast region of Syria, according to Turkish officials who spoke with Reuters.\n\nA security official said the strikes, which were carried out overnight, were intended to sever a transportation route between Iraq and Syria used by Kurdish groups. \u201cIn this way, the group\u2019s transit to Syria and support lines, including ammunition, are shut off,\u201d the official said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if there were casualties, although one official said that the strikes had rendered the site \u201cunusable through various means.\u201d\n\nThe news comes after President Trump\u2019s Monday announcement that he had ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Syrian-Turkish border region in anticipation of a Turkish incursion. On Tuesday the Trump administration confirmed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will meet with President Trump at the White House this month.\n\nTurkey maintains it wants to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria where it will be able to resettle 3.6 million refugees who fled the Syrian civil war and currently reside in Turkey.\n\nKurdish organizations say the Turkish plan is intended to weaken the Kurds by flooding the region with Sunni Arab Muslims. While Kurdish fighters in the Syrian Democratic Forces were instrumental in the U.S.-led fight against ISIS, Turkey considers the SDF a terrorist organization, citing ties to Kurdish militants inside Turkey.\n\nU.S. politicians, including many prominent Republicans, have slammed Trump\u2019s decision to effectively abandon the Kurds before the impending Turkish offensive.\n\n\u201cIf the President sticks with this retreat, he needs to know that this bad decision will likely result in the slaughter of allies who fought with us, including women and children,\u201d said Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) in a statement. \u201cI hope the President will listen to his generals and reconsider.\u201d", "description": "The Turkish military struck targets on the Syria-Iraq border on Tuesday in preparation for an offensive into the northeast region of Syria.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Andrew C.
