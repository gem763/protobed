That hit will come through in Goldman's investing and lending (I&L) business, the analysts said\n\nThat outlook comes after the financial services firm Jefferies told investors back in September that it had to write down $146 million related to its own WeWork investment in the third quarter because of uncertainty about timing and valuation of an IPO. That writedown was as of August 31 \u2014 more than two weeks before WeWork shelved the offering entirely.\n\n\"Based on this announcement, we think it is possible that some of the banks we cover may also take similar writedowns,\" Morgan Stanley analysts led by Betsy Graseck said in a note to clients dated October 4.\n\nWeWork unveiled its filing to go public in August. But it was forced to contemplate a massive valuation cut before ditching the offering entirely, and its co-founder Adam Neumann stepped down as CEO in late September.\n\nGoldman is slated to release third-quarter earnings later this month. The bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the earnings outlook.\n\nMorgan Stanley sees the total I&L revenues down 43% from a quarter earlier and down 29% year-over-year, thanks to both the WeWork writedown and hits to Goldman's public equities portfolio.\n\nRead more: Wall Street gave Adam Neumann up to $500 million he was going to pay back after WeWork's IPO. Now that the offering is pulled, banks are scrambling to hammer out a solution.\n\nThe Morgan Stanley analysts arrived at that $264 million writedown estimate using details of prior venture capital funding rounds provided by data analytics firm PitchBook.\n\nMorgan Stanley estimated that Goldman Sachs owns a 1.4% stake in WeWork, and that JPMorgan, which was slated to be WeWork's lead underwriter, owns a 4% stake. That's compared with with Jefferies' estimated 0.8% stake.\n\nThe analysts also pointed out that Goldman performs \"event-driven\" write-ups and write-downs on its private equity portfolio, citing April commentary from Goldman Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr.\n\n\"You may see up or down movement in the private equity portfolio, occasioned by some event where we might sell a position,\" Scherr said on an April earnings call. \"It might be that there's another round of equity investing at a different valuation level that causes us to re-mark that.\"\n\nGraseck did not put a number on any such writedown for JPMorgan, attributing that decision to how it appears JPMorgan has been accounting for private stakes.\n\n\"We do not see any indications of material write ups in the prior year when The We Company raised private funding at higher valuations,\" she wrote. \"We believe this means that JPM's accounting treatment for The We Company is book value, and not based on post funding round valuations.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley was not among the banks that had signed on to underwrite WeWork's now-shelved initial public offering.\n\nRecently, Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist wrote in a separate note that WeWork's failed IPO should be viewed as a cautionary tale for richly valued, money-losing unicorns.\n\nMutual funds offered by Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, and Hartford Funds have all changed up the valuations they are putting on private shares of WeWork, we reported in early September.\n\nRead more: JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon met with WeWork's Adam Neumann this weekend to hash out how to get its botched IPO back on track", "description": "The analysts estimate Goldman Sachs will report a WeWork-related blow when the bank releases third-quarter earnings later this month.", "authors": ["Rebecca Ungarino"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9cf85e3b33a71ef4053cc2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
