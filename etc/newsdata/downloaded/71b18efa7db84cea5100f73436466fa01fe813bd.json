Sign up here.\n\nBundesbank President Jens Weidmann hasn\u2019t yet declared himself in favor of a fiscal boost in Germany, but his predecessor now says it\u2019s needed.\n\nAxel Weber, the chairman of UBS Group AG, told Bloomberg Television that officials in Europe\u2019s biggest economy need to loosen purse strings rather than maintain a positive budget balance. He echoed this month\u2019s plea to governments by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that \u201cit\u2019s high time for the fiscal policy to take charge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not the environment where fiscal policy in Germany, if you assume the second half is like the first, should be at a big surplus, like a 3% surplus. Actually it\u2019s where fiscal policy needs to react. So the call of central banks that I\u2019ve heard time and again for fiscal policy and structural policies to take more of a responsible approach is absolutely still adequate, it\u2019s still warranted.\u201d -- Axel Weber\n\nWhile the Netherlands this month shifted its stance towards ending an era of debt reduction in favor of fiscal loosening, German officials have held firm. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier played down the prospect of stimulus in comments on Tuesday, while Weidmann told a newspaper in August that there\u2019s no reason for a major economic package. Weber disagrees.\n\n\u201cIn Germany for example, there should be some long term investment-oriented, infrastructure-oriented fiscal expenditure. The easiest thing to do is a tax reform, and if you don\u2019t want to do an income tax reform, you do a corporate tax reform.\u201d\n\nWeber was the Bundesbank president from 2004 until 2011, when he withdrew his prospective candidacy to lead the ECB by resigning over purchases of bonds of indebted European countries during the region\u2019s debt crisis. That decision made way for Draghi to get the ECB role instead, and for Weidmann to succeed him at the German central bank.\n\nRead More: Bundesbank Sees No Need for Fiscal Stimulus in Germany Right Now", "description": "Draghi\u2019s Fiscal Plea to Germany Is Fair, Ex-Bundesbank Head Says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic4792898116a4b518258b26ab110f610b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
