A recent study by a team of academic superstars including Harvard University\u2019s Raj Chetty and the University of California at Berkeley\u2019s Emmanuel Saez \u2014 a frequent collaborator of French economist Thomas Piketty, whose idea of a wealth tax inspired Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2014 has identified the U.S. colleges and universities that best promote upward mobility.\n\nThat study, which assigned hundreds of U.S. universities a score for their success at moving its graduates up the income scale, is posted in several formats on a splashy website, along with a link to an interactive tool from The New York Times that allows you to see how your favorite college rates.\n\nThe researchers found that highly selective colleges and universities such as Berkeley, Columbia, MIT, Stanford, and Swarthmore (which I attended as a first-generation college student) actually do a very good job of elevating lower-income kids to the middle-class and beyond. But they take so few kids from the bottom 20% \u2014 less than 4% of enrollment \u2014 they can\u2019t move the needle much.\n\nRead: Rich parents keep behaving badly to get their children into college\n\nMore: How wiping out $1.5 trillion in student debt would boost the economy\n\nGood state and local universities, however, can and do. That\u2019s why they dominate the list of the 10 colleges that are most effective in helping their graduates move from the lowest 20% (family incomes below $25,000 a year) to the top 20% ($110,000 and above). That\u2019s the stuff of Horatio Alger stories, yet it happens all the time at these American Dream machines.\n\nTwo of the top 10 \u2014 Pace and St. John\u2019s \u2014 are private. Only Stony Brook University (of the State University of New York) cracks U.S. News & World Report\u2019s top 100 national universities rankings for 2020. \u201dThe colleges that have the highest bottom-to-top-quintile mobility rates.\u201d the study\u2019s authors write, \u201care typically mid-tier public institutions\u201d \u2014 colleges the kids of entitled parents like Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin would avoid at any cost. All of these 10 schools are located in California, New York, and Texas.\n\nThese 10 schools can be ethnically concentrated \u2014 Cal State L.A. is two-thirds Hispanic and 89% of the University of Texas, Rio Grande Valley\u2019s students are Hispanic, for example, while others have a high percentage of Asian-Americans. But this is not just an immigration story, one of the study\u2019s co-authors, Prof. John Friedman of Brown University, said in an interview.\n\n\u201cThere's definitely a good share of students [from immigrant families] at high-mobility-rate places,\u201d he said. But even at City University of New York (CUNY), the legendary gateway to the American Dream for generations of poor and minority kids, children from immigrant families \u201cdo very well,\u201d he added \u201cbut there are also an awful lot of students who are not children of immigrants and they do very well, too.\u201d\n\nThe authors contrasted Stony Brook, on eastern Long Island, with Columbia, the Manhattan-based Ivy League university founded in 1754. Not surprisingly, lower-income students who attended Columbia, where they hobnob with the sons and daughters of the American oligarchy, had seven times the likelihood of climbing to the top 1% of the economic ladder as kids who attended Stony Brook. But Stony Brook offered many, many more students access to the middle- and upper-middle class than Columbia.\n\n\u201cThere's something special going on at SUNY Stony Brook, and we don't quite know yet what that is,\u201d Friedman said.\n\nSo, I called Stony Brook to find out. Over the past five years, Stony Brook has improved graduation rates across the board. It has a high-tech, data-driven focus on student performance and a high-touch, advisor-heavy outreach program to make sure kids stay on track.\n\n\u201cFrom the day they set foot on campus, we start talking about success,\u201d said Charles L. Robbins, a vice-provost and dean of the Undergraduate Colleges. \u201cWe have created what I refer to, and I take pride in it, as a culture of success.\u201d\n\nStony Brook is selective, with a 40%+ acceptance rate, and draws almost 10% of its students from New York City\u2019s fabled specialized high schools. Its $10,000 a year in-state tuition, especially when combined with grants and aid, looks dirt cheap compared with Columbia\u2019s $55,000 tuition (though elite colleges provide generous financial aid).\n\nRead: Online courses could help make college affordable, but this $1 billion industry is standing in the way\n\n\u201cWe've got high-quality programs, we've got high-quality students, and we offer a high-value education,\u201d said Braden J. Hosch, head of Stony Brook\u2019s Office of Institutional Research, Planning & Effectiveness. \u201cWhen you do those three things, you end up with good things happening.\u201d\n\nWe should reward colleges with proven results.\n\nGood things are happening \u2014 at Stony Brook and elsewhere, even as states have cut $9 billion from public universities over the last decade. Stony Brook\u2019s budget, for example, remains below where it was before the Great Recession.\n\nThat\u2019s just nuts. Colleges like these show that if you do the right things, you can keep the American Dream alive. We should reward colleges with proven results, and the rest of higher education should follow their lead.\n\nHoward R. Gold is a MarketWatch columnist.
