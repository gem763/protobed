His twist on the original was to put a brown-skinned MAGA-hat wearer in the position of the Spanish martyr captured by a Napoleonic firing squad. In the artist\u2019s restaging, the squad is a band of masked, hoodied, and stick-wielding Antifa aggressors. Adding insult to injury, one of the activists sets fire to the American flag, an incendiary replacement for the lantern that was Goya\u2019s central light source.\n\nThe Resistance, like so much of McNaughton\u2019s art, is shaped for digital consumption. It\u2019s not only that his main mode of distribution is social media; this is not at all unusual for artists seeking an audience today. It\u2019s rather that the Twitter-Facebook ethos shapes the visual logic and tone of McNaughton\u2019s paintings: He leads with partisanship, signals sophistication, and lets the details slide.\n\nIn The Resistance, you\u2019re not supposed to ponder how today\u2019s progressives align with the Napoleonic forces invading Madrid in 1808, or to worry about the context of the Spanish government\u2019s 1814 commission of the painting after Napoleon\u2019s fall. Don\u2019t scratch your head over where McNaughton\u2019s brown-skinned MAGA martyr fits in Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant worldview, and definitely don\u2019t go down the rabbit hole of Spanish colonialism\u2019s legacies in the Americas. The name Goya shouldn\u2019t necessarily ring a bell either. Instead, allow McNaughton\u2019s painting to register as \u201chistorically significant\u201d\u2014something you think you\u2019ve seen before and know is great\u2014without the baggage of historical particulars. Enjoy how easily MAGA iconography is slipped into the \u201chistorically significant\u201d framework. It\u2019s a little bit irreverent, but isn\u2019t it also ennobling? When plunked down in the context of an old master painting, the MAGA ball cap becomes something like the bonnet rouge or liberty cap\u2014the sartorial signifier of revolt for our age.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jennifer Greenhill", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Jon-Mcnaughtons-Art-Tells-Story-Trump-Era"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
