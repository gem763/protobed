The deal has not yet been signed. But the move could be announced Thursday because it would not conflict with a World Series game. Major League Baseball tries to avoid such announcements during its showcase event.\n\nKapler was fired after an injury-depleted team went 81-81 despite significant offseason additions highlighted by Bryce Harper\u2019s arrival. He was 161-163 in his two seasons. The Phillies also interviewed Dusty Baker and Buck Showalter.\n\nGirardi was one of the most prominent candidates to fill vacant managerial spots across baseball. He led New York to its 27th World Series title, beating the Phillies in six games in 2009.\n\nHe succeeded Joe Torre after the 2007 season and spent a decade in pinstripes. He also managed the Marlins one season and was NL Manager of the Year after going 78-84 in 2006. His record with the Yankees was 910-710, the sixth most wins in team history.\n\nThe 55-year-old Girardi hit .267 as a catcher for 15 seasons in the majors. He won three championships with the Yankees in the 1990s and was an All-Star for the Cubs in 2000.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A person familiar with the deal says the Philadelphia Phillies have agreed to hire former Yankees manager Joe Girardi to replace Gabe Kapler.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Maaddi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/girardi_phillies_baseball_53484_c0-206-3844-2448_s1200x700.jpg?2d0793e6bf8d37c7cd303dc1906cd81b3770ef48", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
