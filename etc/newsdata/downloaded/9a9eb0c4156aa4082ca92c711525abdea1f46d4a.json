But the White House op-ed inaccurately claimed the Washington Post didn\u2019t report stories that it actually did cover.\n\nTrump\u2019s Saturday tweet was a capstone to a week when Grisham has given indications how she plans to operate as press secretary, the president engaged in a six-day battle with the press over his misleading claim Alabama was due to take a harder hit from Hurricane Dorian than models suggested at the time, and a White House decision to revoke a reporter\u2019s press pass was blocked by a district court judge.\n\nGrisham, who condemned the press-pass ruling, said Playboy reporter Brian Karem had violated standards of \u201cprofessionalism\u201d and \u201cdecorum\u201d following a heated Rose Garden confrontation with former presidential aide Seb Gorka in July. The White House had moved to revoke Karem\u2019s pass for 30 days.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

A federal judge later overturned that decision.\n\nThe White House Press Association had challenged the administration over its decisions on both Karem and Acosta.\n\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's tweet. Both Rucker and Parker have highlighted positive reactions to their story on social media since its publication. Washington Post reporters rallied to their colleagues' defense Saturday following the president's tweet.\n\nTrump this week has continued to level attacks on the media over the economy, climate and the presidential primary coverage amid the ongoing imbroglio over the president's hurricane comment.\n\nOn Friday, the president\u2019s son, Eric, publicly challenged Washington Post reporter David Farenthold over an email Farenthold sent to a Trump Organization employee seeking details on the company. The president\u2019s son, who is executive vice chairman of the Trump Organization, was widely ridiculed over his reaction to a common approach to business reporting. Farenthold explained his reporting methods in an online video.", "description": "Trump this week has continued to level attacks on the media.", "authors": ["Craig Howie"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1d/c3/6c4033144dc9acab9e91812a2430/1997-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
