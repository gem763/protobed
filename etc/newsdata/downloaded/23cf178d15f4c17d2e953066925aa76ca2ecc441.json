The event is sponsored by 12 venture capital firms and will include Mike Moritz of Sequoia Capital, the biggest venture capital backer of Airbnb, Benchmark's Bill Gurley and Spotify's chief financial officer Barry McCarthy.\n\nWith a private valuation of $US31 billion ($46 billion), Airbnb is likely to be a topic of discussion. It's slated to be one of the most high-profile companies to go public next year.\n\nWhat's clear from its history is that Airbnb executives like to do things their own way \u2014 Dennis Schaal, founder of online travel analysis site Skift\n\nAirbnb executives have been talking about an IPO since at least 2018 and the extended timeline has caused tension inside the company.\n\nLast summer, a handful of former employees sent a letter to Airbnb's founders pleading for a public offering so they could sell their stock options -- some of which start expiring in November 2020, according to the New York Times. Earlier last year, chief financial officer Laurence Tosi left the company after butting heads with chief executive officer Brian Chesky, in part over the timing of the IPO.\n\nLast month, Airbnb officially announced it would go public in 2020 in a one-sentence press release. The company didn't give any additional details on the timeline or whether it intends to file for an IPO or take the direct listing route.\n\nSo far this year, Airbnb's fellow tech unicorns that have gone public have received a chilly reception. Uber Technologies is trading at 30 per cent below its IPO price, Lyft is down more than 40 per cent and Slack is down almost 8 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike these unprofitable companies, Airbnb has a stronger financial position. In the last quarter, it pulled in more than $US1 billion in revenue and the company has said its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation were positive in both 2017 and 2018.\n\nVenture capitalist and Uber's former political adviser Bradley Tusk says a direct listing would be more beneficial for Airbnb, which is now an 11-year-old company.\n\n\"What we've seen with Uber, Lyft and the other big ones is that when you're private for so, so long, you don't get any honeymoon by the time you go public,\" Tusk said. \"Given the struggles so many tech companies have had in the past year and a half, it's not shocking they might want to try something different.\"\n\nAs Airbnb prepares for its entrance into the public markets, one of its major hurdles is solving outstanding regulatory issues in some of its biggest markets, like Paris and New York City, where its business model of short-term home rentals has been at odds with the city for a decade. Investors want Airbnb to solve its regulatory battles before going public since failure to do so could cast doubt on the company's valuation.\n\nDavid Hsu, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School, says that bypassing the roadshow that goes hand-in-hand with a traditional IPO means Airbnb \"wouldn't have to retell the story and expose wounds that are already there\".\n\nHowever, the company could experience more price volatility in its stock because it hasn't been as well vetted and wouldn't have the support of an underwriter.\n\n\"The direct listing is super new but it may well be appropriate for Airbnb,\" Hsu said. \"They are already a well-known business model because lots of people have stayed in an Airbnb so this theoretical danger of volatility in the price may not be that significant.\"\n\nDennis Schaal, founder of online travel analysis site Skift, says he would bet on Airbnb doing a direct listing.\n\n\"What's clear from its history is that Airbnb executives like to do things their own way,\" Schaal wrote in a recent column. \"If the company can avoid the well-worn and costly initial public offering route that many of its peers have slogged through, and go for a direct listing instead, then that would be another jab at mainstream practices, make employees happy, and would fit in nicely with the Airbnb startup narrative and culture.\"\n\nBloomberg", "description": "The San Francisco-based tech unicorn is slated to be one of the most high-profile companies to go public next year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d42d697978b151d9bf6f33d5ce8c05a937becbdf", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
