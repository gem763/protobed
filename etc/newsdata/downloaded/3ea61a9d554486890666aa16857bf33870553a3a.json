On Monday, \"#DeleteFacebook\" was the top trending hashtag on Twitter in the US. The company is under fire for its controversial misinformation policy, under which it knowingly runs political ads that make claims debunked by fact-checkers. The company's advertising policy allows ads with false information \u2014 but not cursing.\n\nOn Saturday, Facebook Newsroom's Twitter account called out Elizabeth Warren, one of the company's most high-profile critics. The strategy didn't work as planned though, and Senator Warren responded by writing \"You're making my point here. It's up to you whether you take money to promote lies.\" Responses to the tweet were largely critical of Facebook.", "description": "Mark Zuckerberg defended his off-the-record dinners, writing in a Facebook post that \"hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning.\"", "authors": ["Mary Meisenzahl"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4e732cc4a0a54220ec448?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
