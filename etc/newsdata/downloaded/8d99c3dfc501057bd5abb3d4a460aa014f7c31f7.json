On Tuesday it was the PMI Manufacturing report that came in much lower than expected. Today it was the ISM Services report that disappointed.\n\nTypically the market doesn't pay much attention to the Services report but the report today came in lower than all 66 estimates complied by Bloomberg. It is remarkable that after the PMI Manufacturing disappointment that economists haven't already anticipated some problems here.\n\nThe market action was extremely quiet until that news hit and it immediately triggered a number of sell programs. The issue now is whether this is going to generate even more selling momentum like the PMI Manufacturing news did on Tuesday.\n\nBreadth is running 2150 winners to 4775 decliners and there is only about 140 new 12-month lows which isn't bad at all. This is a sign that maybe this news is already discounted to a fair degree.\n\nThe most positive thing I see right now is that many of the small caps, recent IPOs, speculate biotech names and other things that have borne the brunt of the selling recently are looking sold out. They are not accelerating to the downside and there are some minor signs of bargain hunters. It is tough to bounce when the indices are under pressure but at least there are a few mild signs of support.\n\nI'm biding my time as I eye some small caps I want to add into earnings news. There is no reason to rush.\n\nThe ISM Services disappointment appears to be digested fairly well right now but keep an eye on the intraday lows. If they are retested then watch out below.", "description": "The ISM disappointment appears to be digested fairly well right now but keep an eye on the intraday lows.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Ism Services Report Immediately Triggered A Number Of Sell Programs", "The Ism Disappointment Appears To Be Digested Fairly Well Right Now But Keep An Eye On The Intraday Lows.", "Jim Cramer", "Bruce Kamich", "Jim Collins", "Bob Lang", "Paul Price", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/0710981a-be6d-11e7-9ebe-aba239a1708e.png"}
