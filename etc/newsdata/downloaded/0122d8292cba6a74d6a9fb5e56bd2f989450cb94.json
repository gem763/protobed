The proposal is limited to remote areas of South America where there is a scarcity of priests but could set a precedent for easing the restriction on married priests throughout the world.\n\nIf Francis, who has already signaled an openness on the issue, accepts the bishops\u2019 recommendation, he will turn the remote areas of the Amazon region into a laboratory for a Catholic Church looking to the global south for its future, with married priests and indigenous rites mixing with traditional liturgy.\n\nThe pope is expected to respond to the proposals by the end of this year.\n\nThe final document of the summit, noting that many of the faithful in the Amazon region have \u201cenormous difficulties\u201d in receiving communion and seeing a priest, proposed to \u201cordain priests suitable and esteemed men of the community,\u201d who had already had \u201cfruitful\u201d experiences as deacons and who \u201creceive an adequate formation for the priesthood, having a legitimately constituted and stable family.\u201d", "description": "It was the first time a summit of bishops convened by a pope has endorsed such a historic change to the tradition of a celibate priesthood.
