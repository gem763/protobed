It\u2019s one of the great perversions of his administration: that a president so undeserving of fealty and protection gets a magnitude of it \u2014 from congressional Republicans, from Steve Mnuchin, from Bill Barr, from Wilbur Ross, now from Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence \u2014 that worthier predecessors in the White House didn\u2019t.\n\nPart of what could be called the Corey Lewandowski trap is Democrats\u2019 failure to accept this. Part of it is their assumption that Trump\u2019s cocky comrades would hesitate to display the garish public colors that they do. But those colors are much of what the president\u2019s supporters like and what fires them up. They embrace Trump as someone who raises a middle finger to propriety, to elites and to the establishment, because they somehow don\u2019t see him as part of that crowd and because they deem that gesture necessary and courageous. So Lewandowski happily mimicked it, not just at the hearing but also the morning after, during an interview with CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota, when he inaccurately described Mueller\u2019s report while blithely conceding that he hadn\u2019t read it.\n\nLewandowski\u2019s performance, like Maguire\u2019s refusal last week to share any details of the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint, was just the latest reminder of the terrible corner that Trump puts Democrats in. Proudly flouting convention and brazenly bending the law, he dares them to try to muscle him back into line, but it turns out that any such effort is anything but swift and sure. And any such effort is interpreted by rigidly partisan voters along rigidly partisan lines.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the frequency of his questionable or outrageous behavior keeps Democrats in a near-permanent state of hysteria that can easily look like overreaction and makes many of the offenses that they\u2019re condemning blur. Was Lewandowski\u2019s snit before Nadler & Company really any more reprehensible and infuriating than the worst from Trumplandia the week before? Is the whistle-blower\u2019s reported complaint urgent in the context of Trump\u2019s rampant conflicts of interest and sustained nuttiness?\n\nIt\u2019s overwhelming \u2014 by design, I think. Trump has discovered that shamelessness is its own reward, and his disciples have learned that lesson well. Lewandowski all but strutted out of that hearing room as Democrats muttered meekly about a contempt citation that would involve time, courts, etc. There\u2019s a way to sidestep that trap.
