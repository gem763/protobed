Ryan Graves scored into the empty net with 39.1 seconds left after a flurry of shots by the Wild.\n\n\u201cI was kind of scrambling around a little bit. I couldn\u2019t get up. Desperation save,\u201d Grubauer said. \u201cThe guys played it really well, they got the puck out and scored. Game over, two points.\u201d\n\nDubnyk had 28 saves.\n\nRantanen, who missed training camp and the preseason before agreeing to a contract with Colorado last weekend, also scored and has three goals in two games. Pierre-Edouard Bellemare got his first goal with Colorado and Nathan MacKinnon had two assists.\n\nColorado, which has won its first two games for the third time in the last four years, gets a five-day break before playing Boston on Thursday.\n\n\u201cGood start. We want to keep it going,\u201d Landeskog said.\n\nRyan Suter had a goal and an assist, and Zach Parise got his first of the season for the Wild, who have lost their first two games against Central Division rivals. Minnesota allowed four goals in the third period at Nashville on Thursday and gave up two quick goals to Colorado before settling down.\n\n\u201cYou take the first 10 minutes out of the game, as you take the first 10 minutes of the game in Nashville, we were really good,\u201d Wild coach Bruce Boudreau said. \u201cWe played really hard. The effort we put in was really good. It was a hard-fought game.\u201d\n\nMinnesota recovered from an early 2-0 deficit but Landeskog put Colorado back in front when he tipped in a pass from Rantanen at 18:54 of the second.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised when I get those on my tape from Mikko anymore,\u201d Landeskog said. \u201cHe\u2019s been serving those for years. I\u2019m glad I was able to put it in, especially losing that 2-0 lead.\u201d\n\nRantanen and Bellemare scored 1:27 apart early in the first period. Rantanen\u2019s goal came just 23 seconds after Colorado went on the power play.\n\nSuter cut the lead in half at 10:17 of the first, and Parise\u2019s power-play goal at 8:31 of the second period got the Wild even.\n\n\u201cWhen we got the second one, I thought we had chances to go ahead,\u201d Parise said. \u201cThey came out buzzing, which you have to expect in this building. We had looks and opportunities, the effort was there and we played hard. They capitalized and that was it.\u201d\n\nMinnesota had two breakaways, but couldn\u2019t convert either. Grubauer made a glove save on Ryan Donato\u2019s backhander in the first period, and Ryan Hartman\u2019s chance just ahead of the Colorado defense went wide right in the second.\n\nNOTES: Colorado C Nazem Kadri was hit in the left skate by a teammate\u2019s shot late in the second period and he went to straight to the locker room. He returned for the third period. \u2026 Dubnyk played in his 300th game for the franchise. He ranks second behind Niklas Backstrom (409) for goaltenders. \u2026 Avalanche LW Matt Calvert played in his 500th NHL game. \u2026 Minnesota LW Zach Parise has 37 points in 37 career regular-season games against Colorado.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWild: Plays at Winnipeg on Thursday.\n\nAvalanche: Hosts Boston on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Colorado lost the lead and momentum, yet a great pass and quick stick put the Avalanche back in the lead.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Kelly"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/wild_avalanche_hockey_03504_c0-146-3500-2186_s1770x1032.jpg?28e1112a076ec7fecf74d701fc168de288d8a301", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
