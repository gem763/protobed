It has already disrupted southern Turkey and threats to the country\u2019s trade at a time of economic trouble. And it has rocked northeast Syria in ways that will further unsettle Turkey.\n\n\u201cIt could potentially drag Ankara into many sub-conflicts that I don\u2019t think they have contemplated through all the way,\u201d said Dareen Khalifa, senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Those areas have always been violated and attacked by the terrorists,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere was infiltration,\u201d he said. \u201cThose terrorist groups were somehow in touch with each other. They were smuggling weapons in and out. Had we remained silent, had we not intervened a lot could have happened. That\u2019s why we had to stop it.\n\nThe YPG has denied taking part in cross border operations, but has acknowledged some overlap in its leadership and that of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) - a Kurdish separatist group banned in Turkey.\n\nBut the operation, which began 9 October, has already brought a measure of chaos to southeast Turkey as well as. During three days along the frontier in several towns adjacent to crucial Syrian battlegrounds, The Independent witnessed sporadic gunfire, airstrikes, artillery and mortar rounds, as well as damaged buildings, traumatised civilians, and preparations for even more refugees than the 3.5 million Syrians already officially registered in Turkey.\n\nI am sad that people are being displaced. I just wish this had never happened Abdullah Aksak, mayor of Ceylanpinar\n\n\u201cWe are trying to prepare for a large number of refugees,\u201d said Abdulla Polat, co-mayor of the city of Suruc, across the border from the flashpoint Syrian city of Kobane.\n\nAuthorities in the city have set up a crisis desk to manage the possibility that thousands of refugees would come over the border to escape the conflict, but have already had to find housing for residents of 40 Turkish villages along the border that have been struck by cross-border shells.\n\nBeneath an idyllic grove of trees, nearly 200 soldiers stood at attention, just hundreds of metres from the wall separating Syria from Turkey. Nearby, farmers harvested cotton from fields. Further down the road, there were about a half dozen armoured personnel carriers and two tanks.\n\nAlong the border near the mostly Kurdish city of Suruc, dozens of villages have been evacuated for fear of getting caught in the crossfire. Parents place their children with relatives as they make risky forays to the border to harvest crops.\n\nRoadways here have been flooded with military vehicles carrying Turkish military personnel. Syrian National Army fighters, remnants of the rebel guerillas who battled against the regime of Bashar al-Assad for years, could be seen gathering near a border outpost outside Tal Abyad, just a couple hundred meters from a playground in Akcakale.\n\nIn Ceylanpinar, authorities have coordinated a large-scale evacuation of the city, placing thousands of people in nearby Viransehir, where the displaced are provided with housing, medical and psychological assistance, as well as food and even nappies.\n\nMissiles from the Syrian side had hit villagers, killing at least 21 civilians on the border.\n\n\u201cOf course we are sad,\u201d said Abdullah Aksak, mayor of Ceylanpinar. \u201cI am sad that people are being displaced. I just wish this had never happened. Two children are killed here. There are some injured people in hospitals. Nearly 80 mortar attacks targeted our district.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s southeast has been roiled by occasional violence repeatedly since the 1980s when it became the setting for the battle between the state and the PKK. Checkpoints, army patrols and sporadic fighting are woven into people\u2019s lives. Turks have also repeatedly launched military operations against the PKK in Iraq over the years.\n\nBut the scale of what the Turks are attempting in their cross-border intervention in Syria is unparalleled.\n\nWhile Turks say they successfully dislodged the Kurdish-led militia, the YPG, from Syria\u2019s northwest Afrin last year at minimal cost and disruption, \u201cthis is not Afrin,\u201d said Khalifa, the analyst, who maintains contacts with both the Ankara government and the SDF.\n\n\u201cThis is 25 per cent of Syria, including a wide open desert that the international coalition has been barely able to control.\u201d\n\nThere are other potential unintended consequences to the Syria intervention. One reason why so many Arabs in Syria\u2019s northeast signed onto the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces was the promise that it would keep the regime at bay. Now that the Kurds have cut a deal with Damascus, the Arab fighters are left with stark choices: potentially submit to the Assad regime they fought against, join with jihadi groups or Isis that continue to confront Damascus. The other option is to flee to Turkey.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming every day via smugglers,\u201d says Mr Polat, the co-mayor of Suruc.\n\nSyrian refugees have already changed the character of the border cities. Akcakale and Tal Abyad are border neighbours akin to El Paso and Ciudad Juarez in along the Mexican-US frontier. Each means \u201cwhite palace\u201d in its respective language, and in both towns residents speak both Turkish and Arabic.\n\nSome 400,000 Syrian refugees live in Sanliurfa province, which had a population of about 1.8 million before the conflict south of Turkey\u2019s began. Some 125,000 refugees live in Akcakale alone, nearly doubling the city\u2019s population, and requiring additional expenditures for health, sanitation and education services.\n\n\u201cFifty per cent of the people on that side moved to this side,\u201d said Mehmet Yalcinkaya, mayor of Akcakale. \u201cYou can imagine the pressures that are already on us.\u201d\n\nBut the more Turkey and its allies push their way into densely populated areas the more they risk creating more displacement, undermining Turkish aims of convincing some Syrians to move back to their country. On Friday, the United Nations said 1,700 people had crossed the border into Iraq since the fighting had begun.\n\n\u201cPeople are already leaving toward the Iraqi border,\u201d says Khalifa. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have a counter effect than what Turkey wanted. The more they push into densely populated areas the more this could entail significant civilian casualties, and displace many of the region\u2019s Kurdish inhabitants.\u201d\n\nNearly 7,000 Isis fighters are either in prison or under heavy watch in northeast Syria. In addition to holding them in prison, the YPG had developed a system of alliances with local tribes to retrofit former Isis fighters into SDF units, or back into civilian life. Dislodging the YPG could dismantle this complicated system, and give Isis new life.\n\nBefore Operation Peace Spring there had been sporadic attacks from the other side, never clear whether they were stray rounds, responses to Turkish military operations, or launched by factions not under the control of the YPG.\n\nBut by and large, the border area has been secure, allowing residents on both sides to recover from the enormous human and economic toll of the first years of the Syria war. Back then numerous armed factions, including Isis, fought for control of Turkey\u2019s northeast and tens of thousands of refugees fled across the border, changing perhaps forever the character of Turkish cities.\n\nRojava may have been a threat to Turkey but it has been largely an abstract one, posing no imminent threat, and making Operation Peace Spring resemble the wars of choice waged by the US and Israel.\n\nThough many Turks back the intervention, they also question whether it should be pursued and are relieved by the temporary halt.\n\nWe have to ask why these 21 civilians and six soldiers have been killed Canan Kaftanoglu, Turkish opposition politician\n\n\u201cWe have to ask why these 21 civilians and six soldiers have been killed,\u201d said Canan Kaftanoglu, a Turkish opposition politician. \u201cWe will see in the future whether the operation has destabilised the region.\u201d\n\nThe conflict may also hurt Turkey\u2019s already fragile economy. Turkey\u2019s unemployment increased in July by 3.1 per cent compared to the previous year, bringing it to a decade-long high of 13.9 per cent, according to official statistics, while youth unemployment reached 27.1 per cent.\n\nOn Tuesday, German automotive giant Volkswagen confirmed that it was delaying a decision on whether to build a new plant in Turkey\u2019s Izmir over opposition to the Syria operation.\n\nTurks living along the border are terrified about the prospect of the Turkish armed forces facing off against the Syrian regime and its Russian patrons. Repeatedly, they said they were desperate to return to their normal lives.\n\n\u201cLook around here,\u201d said one shopkeeper in Ceylanpinar. \u201cDo you see any customers? We are worried about the next phase. My children can\u2019t go to school. They\u2019re in a temporary place now.\u201d\n\nSat in front of full-length portraits of Mr Erdogan and the founder of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, in his office, Mr Yalcinkaya, the mayor of Akcakale, said he was 100 percent behind the war but yearned for calm. \u201cWe want peace and brotherhood. We want to remove the terrorist groups and we want the Syrian refugees to go home.\u201d", "description": "Two weeks ago, there was so much traffic in the main streets of this Turkish border town \u201cyou could not find a place to park,\u201d said one store proprietor.
