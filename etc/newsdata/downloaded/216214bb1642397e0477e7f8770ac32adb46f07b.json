That question won\u2019t go forward for now, but the administration will have another chance to make its case.", "description": "Until it does a better job of explaining why that question is necessary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/EZEQAhADn0ZBnI5WgKP2avDoBG0=/0x227:5120x3107/1920x1080/2019/06/24/1561383886899.None", "published_at": "2019-06-27"}
