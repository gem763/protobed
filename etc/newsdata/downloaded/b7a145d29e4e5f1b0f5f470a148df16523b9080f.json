They attacked witnesses. They attacked us.\"\n\n\"They got protesters to march in front of the courthouse. They went on TV and smeared us with ad hominem attacks,\" he added. \"They planted stories in the press. They did everything Trump is doing, but he's doing it on a much larger scale.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors who investigated Trump's campaign for conspiring with Russia during the 2016 race also treated the case like they would an organized-crime syndicate.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe whistleblower who filed a complaint against him committed espionage. The congressman investigating him should be tried for treason. The lawmakers weighing whether to impeach him are attempting a coup. The witnesses who testify against him are rats. The prosecutors probing him are corrupt.\n\nThat's a sample of the attacks President Donald Trump has lobbed at his perceived enemies as he faces an ongoing impeachment inquiry amid allegations that he used his public office for private gain.\n\nThe latest volleys came on Tuesday. Early in the morning, the president praised the State Department's decision to block US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland from testifying voluntarily before Congress as part of the impeachment probe.\n\nTrump said that while he'd \"love to send\" Sondland to testify, \"he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican's [sic] rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public ... to see.\"\n\nLater in the day, Trump's White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, told House Democrats in a letter that the president and his administration would not cooperate with the \"partisan and unconstitutional\" impeachment inquiry.\n\nPatrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor who was on the team that convicted the Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, said he's struck by the parallels between Trumpworld's handling of the impeachment controversy and the mafia's playbook on pushing back against charges leveled against it.\n\n\"When I prosecuted the mob, one of their go-to tactics whenever we indicted them was to spend a lot of time trying to show the government did something wrong,\" Cotter told Insider. \"It had nothing to do with the substance of the allegations and everything to do with trying to detract from our case by attacking us. It's illogical and it's what we used to call half a confession.\"\n\nRead more: A White House official who listened in on Trump's Ukraine call described it as 'crazy' and 'frightening'\n\nPresident Donald Trump talks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, Oct. 4, 2019, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) More\n\nAssociated Press\n\nTrump takes a page out of the mafia's playbook but 'on a much larger scale'\n\nIn the Gotti case, Cotter added, the similarities are even more stark.\n\n\"His lawyers accused the prosecutors and the FBI of wrongdoing. They attacked witnesses. They attacked us,\" he said. \"They got protesters to march in front of the courthouse. They went on TV and smeared us with ad hominem attacks. They planted stories in the press. They did everything Trump is doing, but he's doing it on a much larger scale.\"\n\nAt the heart of the latest controversy engulfing the White House is a July 25 phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which he repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son for corruption. Biden is a 2020 Democratic frontrunner and one of Trump's chief political rivals.\n\nThe phone call is the subject of an explosive whistleblower complaint that a US intelligence official filed against the president in August. In addition to accusing Trump of abusing his power and violating federal law, it says Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is a \"central figure\" in Trump's effort and that Attorney General William Barr \"appears to be involved as well.\"\n\nTrump and his allies have attacked the whistleblower, suggesting the individual is disloyal to the US and committed espionage against Trump, despite the fact that they followed the law when filing their complaint. The president has also repeatedly called for the whistleblower's identity to become public.", "description": "The mafia \"did everything Trump is doing, but he's doing it on a much larger scale,\" said a former federal prosecutor who dealt with organized crime.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EWM5KDkjq0lC6S6dF2.arA--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/c33da16ec7ba1bb2e3445ddc71b4fbfe", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
