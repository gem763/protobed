It\u2019s just we\u2019re not seeing the same sort of rebound because Brisbane didn\u2019t get the run-up those other markets saw.\u201d\n\nMrs Ell said apartment supply in Brisbane had fallen significantly since its peak in 2016/17 and was now at a more sustainable level.\n\n\u201cSo, now we have a much weaker supply of apartments coming online, combined with the fact we\u2019re seeing demand starting to pick up as a consequence of the RBA being in the middle of an easing cycle, and that\u2019s pushing up apartment values,\u201d she said.\n\nQueensland\u2019s housing market was also set to be supported by an improving state economy, which would continue to benefit from strong commodity exports \u2014 in particular metallurgical coal and liquid natural gas, according to the report.\n\n\u201cEconomic development and construction and mining job growth in the state should give a lift to dwelling prices, especially in regional areas where infrastructure projects will be targeted,\u201d she said.", "description": "BRISBANE home values are set to rise in the next two years, with apartment prices tipped to blitz houses as they rebound from the oversupply glut, a new report reveals.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Tilley"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4e4032b5e72ca931e59449c61899c3cf?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
