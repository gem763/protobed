Mobile data services such as 3G and 4G were used for less than a third of such activity.\n\nIt's partly thanks to this that 60% of users consume one gigabyte of data every month, the regulator said.\n\nAnalysis by the Citizens Advice earlier this year found that 71% of SIM-only customers were paying for data they did not use - costing \u00a3800 million annually.\n\nMobile conversations Liverpudlians like to chat\n\nData shows that the total number of minutes spent on mobile calls increased from 132.1 billion to 148.6 billion between 2012 and 2017.\n\nHowever, last year data collected by Ofcom showed that the amount of time spent making calls from mobile phones had fallen for the first time.\n\nYoung people often prefer messaging services over voice calls, the regulator has noted, and services such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are becoming increasingly popular alternatives to voice calls.\n\nHaving a good signal has \"never been more important\" said Ian Macrae, director of market intelligence at Ofcom.\n\nThe regulator said that while 92% of people get basic mobile phone reception in their homes from all four networks, some still \"struggle\" to get a good signal.\n\nConsumer group Which? argued that \"too many\" people faced poor reception.\n\n\"Until the government publishes plans for how it will achieve its current commitment, the UK will continue to lag behind and lack the comprehensive mobile and broadband connectivity it desperately needs,\" said Caroline Normand, director of advocacy.\n\nThe UK government has committed to increasing mobile coverage to 95% of the UK by the end of 2022.", "description": "An Ofcom survey suggests that people from Liverpool spend the longest time on mobile phone calls.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/24DC/production/_109163490_gettyimages-1141406122.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
