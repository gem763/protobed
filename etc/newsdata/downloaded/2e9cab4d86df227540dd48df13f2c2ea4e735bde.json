Gen. Anthony Potts, head of Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier, told reporters Monday.\n\nUnlike the first-generation IHPS, the new combat helmets feature a pressed and molded polyethylene material that has yielded significant weight reduction, Douglas Tamilio, director of the Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), explained.\n\nThe new IHPS, a three-pound helmet, can sufficiently offer protection against sniper fire at 40% less weight than its predecessor, a three-pound combat helmet that also required a two-pound applique to provide the same level of protection provided by the newer IHPS system, which doesn't require any added protection.\n\nRead more: These 3 defense industry players have revealed their visions for the Army's next attack helicopter\n\n\"To get to a classified level of protection against higher level threats,\" Potts explained, discussing the first-generation helmets, \"what we had to do for our soldiers is we had to add a two-pound applique on the top of the helmet.\"\n\n\"Soldiers don't particularly like the fact that they have five pounds on their head, but if you are traveling through urban areas where there is a known sniper threat, our soldiers were willing to put the additional applique on for at least a period of time.\"\n\nBut, with the new materials for the second-generation helmet, the applique is no longer necessary.\n\n\"Instead of having five pounds to protect against that threat in a very specific region of your helmet, now the entire helmet protects against that threat at three pounds,\" Potts said, adding that testing has revealed that the new helmets not only meet but exceed protection requirements.\n\nThe IHPS is part of the new Soldier Protection System, an integrated suite of systems that includes the torso and extremity protection, the vital torso protection, and the new combat helmets. PEO Soldier estimates that it is still a year out from fielding the entire equipment set.", "description": "Incorporating new materials into the next-generation helmet allowed it to provide increased protection at 40% less weight than its predecessor.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da655914af909541f499623?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
