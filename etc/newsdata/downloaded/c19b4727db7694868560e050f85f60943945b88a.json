Instead of hearing the group's latest hit, \"Boy With Luv,\" though, the clip was synced up to Lizzo's very own hit, \"Juice.\"\n\n\"The Lizzo x @bts.bighitofficial collab we need,\" she wrote in the caption. But it turns out that Lizzo had never heard the original song they were performing \u2014 or any of BTS's music for that matter \u2014 until now.\n\nDuring CBC Music's game of Jam or Not a Jam, we played \"Boy With Luv\" for Lizzo, who seemed thrown off by the \"curve ball\" of a song at first. But once she figured out who it was, she was blown away \u2014 and perhaps a little turned on?\n\n\"Now I know why people sleep outside in tents for days,\" she concluded, referring to the Beatlesmania-esque fandom for the group. \"That was sexy. That was sexual, actually.\"\n\nNow all we can do is sit and hope for a real collaboration to happen \u2014 even though BTS just announced that they are taking a break. We can dream!", "description": "'This is making me excited in a lot of weird ways!'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5250036.1565978399!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/lizzo-bts.jpg"}
