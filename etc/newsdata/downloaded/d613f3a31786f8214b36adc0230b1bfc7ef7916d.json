This week, polls from NBC/Wall Street Journal and Quinnipiac University showed a plurality of voters opposed to removing Trump, while an ABC/Washington Post survey found a 49 percent plurality in support. However, a Fox News poll released Wednesday did show support for Trump\u2019s removal reaching a slim majority of 51 percent, an ominous sign for the president.\n\nSupport for Trump\u2019s removal could rise further as the inquiry proceeds\u2014as I\u2019ve noted, while polls show that virtually all voters who approve of Trump\u2019s job performance already oppose impeachment, there\u2019s more room for support of impeachment to grow among voters who disapprove of him overall. Still, unless new information somehow cracks Trump\u2019s hold on his base, impeachment likely will remain a nerve-wracking political vote for Democrats in the districts that Trump carried in 2016.\n\nThat raises a critical question: If an impeachment vote reaches the full House, should marginal Democrats best position themselves for 2020 by separating themselves from the party by voting no, or helping the party send a clearer message by voting yes?\n\nRead: The risks of impeachment are overblown\n\nThe precedent of other polarizing high-profile votes in recent years doesn\u2019t offer a decisive answer. But the evidence leans toward the conclusion that it is growing more difficult for members of Congress to isolate themselves from their party\u2019s actions, regardless of how they individually vote. Political-science research shows that for more and more voters, congressional elections are becoming more parliamentary, meaning they are less a choice between two candidates than a decision about which of the two parties they want to control the majority and set the country\u2019s direction. That\u2019s seen in the dwindling share of voters who back one party for president and the other for Congress has; it\u2019s now routine for the president\u2019s party to win over 90 percent of the voters who approve of his job performance in House and Senate races, and to lose over 90 percent of the voters who disapprove.", "description": "Democrats in swing districts may think they can boost their reelection chances by bucking their party, but that isn\u2019t how recent elections have played out.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX6W85G/facebook.jpg?1570715700", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
