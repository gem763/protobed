At the same time, the agency is withdrawing the 'BB-(EXP)' rating on the company's proposed US dollar senior unsecured notes. The notes are rated one-notch higher than the company's Issuer Default Rating as we believe the recovery prospects are superior. The bond is secured by first-lien property and other assets, and second-lien account receivables and inventories. Under our recovery analysis, we have assumed that the company's asset-based lending facility will be fully drawn and its swap obligations will have priority on the proceeds from the notes' collateral. The proceeds of the notes will be used to refinance and restructure the company's existing facilities. The final ratings are contingent upon the success of the proposed bond issue and the receipt of final documents materially conforming to information already received.InfraBuild's ratings are underpinned by the company's leading market position in steel long products in Australia, its vertically integrated business model and electric arc furnaces (EAF), which allow the company to operate flexibly with low capital intensity.The company's ratings are constrained by its relatively weak cost position against international peers and small-scale operations from an international perspective.The Stable Outlook reflects our expectation that the company will maintain its market leadership and stable earnings profile, benefitting from its vertically integrated and flexible operation with EAFs. Following the revision in the capital structure of the issuance, we now expect leverage, measured by total adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR, to remain around 3.5x, on average, over the next four years (3.7x in the financial year ended June 2020 (FY20)) from an earlier forecast of 4.4x. Fitch is withdrawing InfraBuild's expected unsecured bond rating as the rating is no longer expected to convert to a final rating. Key Rating Drivers Vertical Integration, Flexible Operations: InfraBuild is able to maintain a stable earnings profile through the cycle due to the flexible operating structure of its EAFs, which can adjust production levels to match demand and have low fixed costs. This flexibility supports InfraBuild's credit profile over blast furnaces, which have high fixed costs and less flexible operating profiles. InfraBuild also benefits from backward integration into scrap, which comprises the largest component of raw-material costs (FY19: 25%). This vertical integration smooths the company's earnings profile by improving diversification.Market-Leading Position: InfraBuild is Australia's sole EAF steel long-product manufacturer and operates the country's second-largest ferrous and non-ferrous recycling business. Its strong market position has allowed InfraBuild to maintain around 63% volume share of domestic steel long products over the last decade, despite stiff competition from imports. In addition, InfraBuild reported positive EBITDA of around AUD130 million during the previous downturn in FY16. We believe this was possible due to the company's flexible operations, reliable supply and broad product offering compared with imports.InfraBuild is also Australia's leading steel long-product distributor. It competes with smaller independent distributors that sell a mix of imported and InfraBuild-manufactured products. Fitch believes InfraBuild's strong market position, large distribution network and high steel long-product market share, including volume sold to external distributors, allow the company to charge a premium over the import parity price. We expect the company to retain its strong domestic market position as long as it maintains a competitive price over imports.High Residential Market Exposure: We expect weak organic steel sales volume and prices in FY20 due to the company's high residential construction market exposure. However, the company's plan to acquire four steel distribution and recycling companies, and its cost-cutting initiatives, should support revenue and earnings growth during the period. We expect volume to recover from FY21 as demand from the engineering and construction (EC) sector improves. InfraBuild's volume exposure to the residential and EC sectors was around 40% and 25%, respectively, in FY19.Weak Cost Position, Small Scale: InfraBuild has a small-scale operation in terms of EAF production volume, at 1.4 million tonnes a year, and a weak cost position compared with peers, especially in China. Fitch believes this would make it difficult for InfraBuild to compete in the export market. Profitability could come under pressure if low-cost producers, especially Chinese steel mills, increase export volume into Australia, although we do not expect this to occur in the short-to-medium term due to China's effort to reduce its steel-mill capacity and Australia's geographic isolation that results in longer supply lead time.Fitch believes InfraBuild's cost position is competitive against imports after adjusting for freight, import tariffs and port-handling charges, as evidenced by the company's resilient domestic volume share over the last decade. However, there is a risk of rising Chinese imports affecting InfraBuild's profitability, especially during times of weak Chinese steel consumption or if iron-ore and coking-coal prices become competitive against scrap. Derivation Summary We assess InfraBuild's rating as being in line with other Fitch-rated 'BB' category EAF steel producers due to the company's integrated business model, flexible operating profile and leading market position in Australia. The ratings are constrained by InfraBuild's relatively weak cost position, scale, and higher leverage.The ratings of InfraBuild are comparable with those of US-based Commercial Metals Company ( CMC (NS: ); BB+/Stable). CMC has better geographic and operational diversification due to its operations in the US and Poland, as well as its higher number of operating mills. However, InfraBuild's strong market position and long-term customer relationships help to offset its relatively weaker diversification.Both companies have vertically integrated business models, receive a premium over the import parity price and have a similar absolute level site-operating cost. However, Fitch believes CMC's mini mill in the US benefits from strict tariff barriers and access to cheap electricity and scrap, which results in better margins and a lower threat from Asian imports.CMC's leverage metric, measured by total adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR, of about 3x is also around a half turn lower than that of InfraBuild with a better EBITDAR margin. These factors underscore the two-notch rating differential between the two entities.Brazil-based Gerdau S.A. (BBB-/Stable) has better diversification, business scale, profit margin and lower leverage position than InfraBuild, but InfraBuild's dominant domestic market position accounts for the three-notch rating differential between the two entities. Key Assumptions Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer - Weak organic volume and prices, especially in the distribution business, due to volume contraction in the residential-construction sector in FY20.- EBITDA margin to improve to around 5.5% due to cost-cutting initiatives, including savings from a continuous improvement programme and cost synergies from planned acquisitions (FY19: 4.5%).- Capex of around AUD115 million in FY20, then remaining at around 2% of revenue.- No dividend. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action- Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained below 4.0x (FY19: 5.1x).- EBITDAR margin sustained above 8% (FY19: 6.6%).Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action- Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR above 5.0x for a sustained period.- EBITDAR margin below 6% for a sustained period. Liquidity and Debt Structure Adequate Liquidity: InfraBuild's next significant debt maturity is in September 2022, consisting of a AUD250 million asset-based lending facility. We expect the company to have adequate liquidity from its undrawn asset-based facility and projected free cash flow to meet the repayment of its proposed notes, which will be due in September 2024.
