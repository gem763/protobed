The high-street retailer continues to knock out sophisticated, quality winterwear for affordable prices, and this scarf is no exception. We\u2019re a big fan of the neat Herringbone navy and white zig-zag design.

You love snow. You want a scarf that reflects your love of snow. This scarf is your way of doing exactly that. It\u2019s white, like snow, and has a love heart on it. It\u2019s also comfortable, warm and easy-on-the-eye. Perfect for a wintry day.

Kate Moss made it classy, but copious amounts of copy cat prints devalued the brand slightly. Alas, Burberry is now very much in vogue. This classic, cashmere scarf is not cheap but it\u2019s a standout wardrobe piece that you can cherish forever.\n\nBuy now\n\nKnightsbridge Neckwear paisley aviator scarf: \u00a331.95, Woods of Shropshire\n\nNow we couldn\u2019t put together a list of men\u2019s scarves without including a bright, patterned paisley option.
