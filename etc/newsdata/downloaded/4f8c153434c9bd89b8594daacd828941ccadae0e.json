When told to stop again he replied: 'I 'd 'I will stab you in the kidney, I will stab you in the windpipe.'\n\nQuaye then carried on his outburst, which had started after a manager who had offered to look for a handbag belonging to a female friend of Quaye, was unable to find it.\n\nQuaye became angry and when asked to calm down he became even more angry and had to be held down on the floor.\n\nAfter calming down a second time he picked up a bicycle and tried to throw it, he then went across the road and kicked a BMW.\n\nIn the police interview at Acton police station the next day he said he had not eaten properly since arriving at 4pm to rehearse for his show and couldn't remember very much.\n\nHe described the manager as a diamond and said he had always had a good relationship with him, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard.\n\nIn 1998 Quaye won a BRIT Award for the British Male Solo Artist of the Year (pictured above receiving the award)\n\nMr Pakenham told the court Quaye has a total of 14 previous convictions related to alcohol.\n\nAfter sentencing was adjourned Quaye asked whether he could revisit the Troubadour to resolve a pay dispute after hearing his bail conditions, which included not visiting the bar.\n\nHit singles 'Even after All', 'Sunday Shining' and 'Your Love Gets Sweeter' shot Quaye to pop-chart fame in the late 90s.\n\nHis 1997 album Maverick a Strike went double platinum and in 1998 he won the Best British Male Solo Artist at the BRITs.\n\nHe was praised for his laid-back synergy of musical styles combining styles like roots reggae and trip-hop.\n\nEdinburgh born Quaye also has a notable musical heritage as son of composer Cab Kaye and half-brother of Elton John's guitarist Caleb Quaye.\n\nBut recently bad behaviour has over-shadowed Quaye's once bright career with a recent post-show drunken rampage at the Old Bakery in Truro, Cornwall.\n\nThe singer reportedly kicked in a B&B door and called guests 'c***s' on a post-show rampage after a show.\n\nHe head butted a terminally ill friend in a row over Game of Thrones and was convicted of assault in 2016.\n\nHe was also found guilty of aggravated assault in 2012 and admitted possession of cannabis in 2003.\n\nHe was also thrown off-stage by a promoter in 2015 after arriving on stage an hour late and delivering a lacklustre show.\n\nQuaye, of Bolton Gardens, Earls Court, admitted assaulting Mr Jenei by beating.\n\nHe was bailed ahead of sentence until 14 October on condition he does not go to the Troubadour bar.", "description": "Finley Quaye threatened to shoot a bar manager and 'get a grenade' after a gig in London.
