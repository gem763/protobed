Polls have shows that nearly half of all Americans expect another mass shooting to happen soon.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A spate of deadly mass shootings has stoked fresh debate about gun control\n\nBusinesses have long avoided the controversial subject, but in recent years a spate of high-profile attacks at schools and festivals have pushed them into the debate.\n\nRetailers, including most recently Walmart, have limited or banned gun sales and asked the public not to carry weapons openly in their stores even where legally permitted.\n\nIn Wednesday's letter, the business chiefs from companies such as Levi Strauss, Pinterest, Bain Capital, Gap and Brookfield Property Group, called the situation an \"urgent public health crisis\".\n\n\"Doing nothing about America's gun violence crisis is simply unacceptable and it is time to stand with the American public on gun safety,\" they wrote.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Congress will act.\n\nThis week, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives took up bills that seek to remove guns from people deemed a risk, ban high-capacity ammunition magazines and prohibit people convicted of violent hate crime misdemeanors from possessing firearms.\n\nBut the Senate, which has a Republican majority, has stayed quiet on the subject, and US President Donald Trump has waffled on his position.", "description": "The leaders of 145 companies send a letter to Congress about \"an urgent public health crisis\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4412/production/_108762471_1dc66a08-3f01-45c2-addc-6987d0923de6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
