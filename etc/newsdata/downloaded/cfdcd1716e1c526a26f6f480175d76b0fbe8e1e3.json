Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) promising to decriminalize illegal immigration and the majority endorsing a plan to force American taxpayers to provide free health care to all illegal aliens.\n\nThe lack of questions on immigration to 2020 Democrats comes as swing voters are increasingly turned off by the candidates\u2019 plans to bring millions of more foreign workers to the U.S.\n\nThe latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds that the 2020 Democrats\u2019 health care for illegal aliens plan is the most unpopular policy position thus far in the race for president, with opposition from 62 percent of all likely voters.\n\nPolling from Harvard/Harris reveals among all U.S. voters, and particularly with swing voters, that presidential candidates campaigning for immigration, illegal and legal, is the most unpopular policy position.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
