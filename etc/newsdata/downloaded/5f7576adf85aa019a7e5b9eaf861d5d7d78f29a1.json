The game has reportedly achieved over 100 million downloads since going live at the beginning of this month.\n\nThat easily beats out the launch-week figures that Sensor Tower recorded for games that will be Call of Duty\u2019s biggest rivals. There are caveats, however. While PUBG Mobile, for example, got 28 million downloads in its first week, its rollout was staggered across regions. The mobile version of Fortnite, meanwhile, was downloaded 22.5 million times, but it was only available on iOS at first.\n\nWorth noting that this is without a China launch either.\n\n\n\nActivision previously had 37m monthly active users across its brands (Call of Duty, Crash Bandicoot etc...) on PC/Console.\n\n\n\nIn just one week they reached more than 100m with a successful mobile game using the COD IP. https://t.co/UlrIhkfB2z \u2014 Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) October 8, 2019\n\nStill, Call of Duty: Mobile\u2019s figures are impressive, particularly considering that it hasn\u2019t yet launched in China. \u201cThis is by far the largest mobile game launch in history in terms of the player base that\u2019s been built in the first week,\u201d Sensor Tower\u2019s Randy Nelson tells Reuters. For comparison, the firm recorded 90 million downloads for Mario Kart Tour the week prior.\n\nSensor Tower says that iOS made up 55.7 percent of Call of Duty: Mobile\u2019s downloads and 53 percent of the total $17.7 million in revenue from in-app purchases. The US accounted for 16.9 percent of downloads and 43.1 percent of spending.\n\nDespite the lack of domestic launch, Call of Duty: Mobile was developed by Tencent\u2019s TiMi Studio in Shenzhen, China and published by Activision. TiMi has previously been best known for League of Legends-style mobile MOBA Honor of Kings, which by some metrics is the most popular game on the planet.", "description": "A huge smash hit for Tencent", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3m7ocWJ1LHSxlg8elkmDGmzdZj8=/0x260:1820x1213/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19272013/MP_Killhouse_Logo.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
