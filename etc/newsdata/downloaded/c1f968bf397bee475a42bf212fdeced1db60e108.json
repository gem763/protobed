The PM will not ask for an extension \u2013 he will tell EU leaders there should be no delays, they should reject Parliament\u2019s letter asking for a delay, and we should get Brexit done on October 31 with our new deal\u2019.\n\nHowever this interpretation is being contested, and some predict the issue might end up in the High Court next week.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
