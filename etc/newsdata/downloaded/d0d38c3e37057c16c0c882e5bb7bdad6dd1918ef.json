Now, in my spare time, I\u2019m working on one that is trickier than usual: My own.\n\nWhere to begin? Maybe at the beginning: \u201cMy mother gave birth to me around noon on a cool and rainy summer day, July 30, 1956, in Minneapolis. Then she smoked a cigarette.\u201d\n\nIf my editors don\u2019t like that intro, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not writing for publication. I\u2019m writing only for those few friends and family members who may one day care to know more about my life. I don\u2019t want what many people seem to consider the standard form for obituaries: A list of names, dates and achievements interspersed with quotes about my nobility, generosity and devotion to family. There will be no speculation about whether I have gone on to an eternal reward.\n\nInstead, I will attempt to answer the three things I try to convey when writing someone else\u2019s obituary: What was he trying to do? Why? And how did it work out?\n\nIt isn\u2019t that I expect to die imminently. By writing my own obituary, I\u2019m simply practicing what I preach: Write your own story while you can. Don\u2019t leave it to family members, who are almost certain to make a hash of it.\n\nSurely I am the only person who remembers that my journalism career began at age 5, when I founded a short-lived, handwritten newspaper called Worm Killers (though even I can\u2019t recall why I chose that name). No one else could tell you how many monasteries I visited when I (much later) wrote a story about Trappist beers in Belgium. (Five.)\n\nWhen I write obituaries for this newspaper, family members are almost always eager to talk about their loved one. Many seem to find it therapeutic. Yet some struggle to answer basic questions. Did she have a middle name? Did he graduate from college? What did he study? What did her parents do for a living?\n\nMore important, many have no idea why their father or mother chose one path in life over another. My children, should they care, will know.\n\nThey may wonder how I got my name(s), for instance. My parents christened me James Robert Hagerty. The James honored my paternal grandfather. The Robert was for my dad\u2019s brother, who died in World War II. What my parents always called me, though, was Bob. At some point, in a frivolous attempt to sound like a serious writer, I decided my byline should be James R. Hagerty. Now friends call me Bob, smart alecks call me Jim Bob, and other people don\u2019t know what to call me. Moral of the story: Name the kid what you intend to call the kid.\n\nAs a writer of obituaries, I like to know about people\u2019s early jobs, those first steps into adult responsibilities. I\u2019ve written about successful people who started out fixing radios, parking cars, selling college-lecture notes or performing magic tricks.\n\nFor myself, I will mention my brief career at Kmart, where I was assigned to assemble bicycles one day and then left unsupervised. Though I had no skill at mechanics, I did my best to figure it out. When the first bicycle seemed complete, there were still several parts left over whose purpose and place eluded me. I threw them in the trash.\n\nI\u2019ll be sure to write about my few triumphs, such as when, at age 18, I was hired to take publicity photos for a stripper and ended up winning first prize in the local camera club\u2019s monthly contest. But my mistakes may be more interesting and instructive.\n\nThe author\u2019s father, Jack Hagerty, in the 1940s.

Perhaps I will confide that my approach to life was to go with the flow and take the opportunities that presented themselves, rather than make a strategic plan.\n\nThose of us whose deaths will not be front-page news may wonder why we should bother writing down our stories. Who will care? The answer is that we don\u2019t know. It\u2019s quite possible no one will ever read my story. I\u2019m not worried about that. If nothing else, I find it interesting to revisit my misadventures and try to figure out what they meant. Another motivation for me is that I wish my father, who died in 1997, had left me more clues about his life.\n\nOnce you resolve to write your own obit, how do you get the job done? My advice is to set aside 15 to 30 minutes once or twice a week until you finish. Don\u2019t fuss about literary flourishes. Just write the story simply, in your own voice. As for structure, I\u2019m going with chronological order. It may not show much imagination, but it provides a clear path for the writer and the reader.\n\nWhen I sum up other people\u2019s lives, I am not writing tributes. I aim to include the ups and downs, the triumphs and errors, even the humiliations. I must do the same for my own story. But how many of my embarrassing mistakes, lapses and weaknesses should I record? And which ones? I\u2019m still struggling with that part.\n\nSo what was I trying to do with my life? From an early age, I wanted to write for a newspaper. Why? I went with the flow. My parents were both journalists\u2014my mother still is, at age 92\u2014and I discovered early on that I had more aptitude for writing than, say, bicycle assembly.\n\nAnd how did it work out? Pretty well, on the whole. Journalism has allowed me to live in New York, Hong Kong, Paris, London, Brussels, Atlanta and now Pittsburgh. If you count my brief editorship of Worm Killers, I\u2019ve been at it for 57 years. I still haven\u2019t come up with a better plan.\n\nMr. Hagerty is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in Pittsburgh.
