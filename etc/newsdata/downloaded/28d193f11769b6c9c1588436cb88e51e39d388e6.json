I do a bit of meditation and it sort of turns the nuttiness down a bit.\n\n'I think everyone should do a bit of meditation, ten minutes a day, I think it's an important thing.

I know as a human being we deal with anxiety, there wasn't even a word for it 15 years ago, 'anxiety', no one really knew what it was.\n\n'That idea of just impending doom, you don't quite know why so they've given Mick this storyline where he's trying to be the glue that holds everything together when actually behind-the-scenes he can't breathe properly and he thinks he's having a heart attack and it's trying to play it right.\n\n'I've never had a panic attack in real life.
