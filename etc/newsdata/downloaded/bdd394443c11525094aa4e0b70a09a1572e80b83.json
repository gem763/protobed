After scoring just 13 points in a loss to the Los Angeles Rams, Mayfield was called out by former New York Jets coach Rex Ryan.\n\nHow bad did it get? Well, Ryan called Mayfield \u201coverrated as hell.\u201d\n\nHaha talk to em Rex! Rex Ryan has had enough and he ain\u2019t lyin lol.. Joe Thomas ain\u2019t walking through those doors anytime soon... they better fix that offensive tackle issue before the 49ers game in 2 weeks lol pic.twitter.com/jDPx4YX92v \u2014 CrockTIME (@eric_crocker) September 23, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAfter casually dropping that line, Ryan is asked to explain why he thinks Mayfield is overrated. Here\u2019s a list of all the things Ryan says Mayfield needs to fix:\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s a one-read guy who improvises when his first look isn\u2019t there.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s too slow to outrun guys when he takes off.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s not getting the ball out in rhythm.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s staring down guys.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s not that accurate down the field.\n\n\u2022 He didn\u2019t get the ball out quick enough against the Rams.\n\nThat\u2019s a long list, and while Ryan is perhaps exaggerating, Mayfield hasn\u2019t been great to open the season. Through three games, Mayfield has thrown three touchdowns passes against five interceptions. He has seen his completion percentage drop from 63.8 percent last season to 56.9 in 2019. He hasn\u2019t produced like people expected.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Mayfield is bound to play like this forever. He has plenty of talent, and looked like a star last season. There\u2019s a scenario where Mayfield and the offense gets on track and he starts playing like a superstar talent again.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, is Mayfield overrated? If Ryan what is talking about right now is Mayfield not living up to the expectations placed on him during the offseason, maybe. But if Ryan is suggesting Mayfield will continue to be this bad, that seems unlikely.\n\nThat\u2019s not to dismiss Ryan\u2019s criticisms. Mayfield hasn\u2019t played like an All-Pro to open the season. It\u2019s just as foolish to assume what Mayfield has done in a three-game sample will continue to happen, especially when Mayfield showed he could play better than this last year.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
