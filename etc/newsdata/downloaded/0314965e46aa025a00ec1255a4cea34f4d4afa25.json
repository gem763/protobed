He turned 75 on Sept. 25, the same day his wife celebrated her 50th.\n\n\u201cCatherine, my wife, and I have the same birthday,\u201d he explained. \u201cTwenty-five years apart, the same day, but who's counting?\u201d\n\nHe also discussed his famous father, who turns 103 in December.\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS ADMITS WIFE CATHERINE ZETA-JONES STILL GIVES HIM BUTTERFLIES AFTER ALL THESE YEARS\n\n\u201cHaving a younger bride makes me feel good on one side,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cI\u2019ve got the old man over here on the other side, who still has a full head of hair.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt\u2019s all good. You can\u2019t be an idiot about it. So 75, I look at the 15-year program, if I still got my marbles by the time I\u2019m 90. After that, it\u2019s all golden.\u201d\n\nAs they get up in years, family is increasingly important to the Douglas clan. In August, Michael\u2019s son, Cameron, posted a photo to Instagram showing the various generations all posing in one shot.\n\nThe photo highlights Cameron, 40, holding his 19-month-old daughter Lua with girlfriend Viviane Thibes, while the rest of the family \u2013 four generations to be exact \u2013 sits around the table.\n\nKirk is spotted at the head of the table with his signature sunglasses. His wife, Anne Buydens, 100, sits a few seats away, near Zeta-Jones.\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS SAYS CATHERINE ZETA-JONES TEASES HIM ABOUT AGING\n\n\u201c#Familyfirst,\u201d Cameron captioned the post.\n\nWhen Michael received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame last November, his father proudly appeared front and center to support him, People magazine shared.\n\n\u201cIt means so much to me, Dad, that you\u2019re here today,\u201d the Oscar-winning actor said, tearing up, at the ceremony. \u201cThank you for your advice, inspiration, and I\u2019ll say it simply and with all my heart: 'I\u2019m so proud to be your son.'\u201d\n\nKirk Douglas has been married to Buydens since 1954. When Fox News asked the couple the secret behind their lasting marriage in 2017, the pair was no-nonsense about their unconventional approach. While Buydens does turn a blind eye to infidelity, the pair, who raised two sons, credited date night for sparking the romance every day.\n\n\u201c[Date night is] the same as it\u2019s been throughout our marriage,\u201d said Douglas. \u201cWe spend what we call the \u2018golden hour\u2019 together at around 6:30 each night. We\u2019ll sit and talk and laugh and share our day and our thoughts with each other.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cExcept now we are very 21st century and bring along our iPads,\u201d added Buydens.\n\nFox News\u2019 Stephanie Nolasco contributed to this report.", "description": "Actor Michael Douglas got candid about his aging family, including his younger wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and father, Kirk Douglas.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/8eca9daf5651cb838e23d5b553dec5d4w-c0xd-w640_h480_q80.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
