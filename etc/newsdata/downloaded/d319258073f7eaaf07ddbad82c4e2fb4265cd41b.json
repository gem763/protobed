But insiders know that more people today are discontent living and working in the traditional tech hubs \u2014 New York, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay Area and Boston \u2014 than ever before.\n\nAmong the reasons? Skyrocketing housing costs, pricey child care, the crowds and relentless traffic. Sometimes the local culture isn't a fit or they want to be nearer to family.\n\nUnfortunately many workers would love to leave the cities behind but need to keep their job. So they're effectively anchored to these areas and strapped to their desks.\n\nAlthough internet-powered communications has enabled workers to perform their duties from any location, the fact is, too many companies still require staff to be based on one of the country's two coasts.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be this way. In fact, it shouldn't be this way.\n\nFor more on tech, transformation and the future of work, join CNBC at the @ Work: People + Machines Summit in San Francisco on Nov. 4. Leaders from Dropbox, SAS, Uber and more will teach us how to balance the needs of today with the possibilities of tomorrow, and the winning strategies to compete.\n\nNot only has this outmoded way of thinking helped to create an economic imbalance, where vast amounts of wealth are concentrated in a tiny handful of cities, it is also responsible for a fundamental imbalance between where people want to live and where the jobs are located.\n\nA recent Gallup poll found that while 80% of Americans live in urban areas, only 12% said they want to live there. Asked where they would live if they had their choice, the top response was a rural area.\n\nFreelancing in America 2019, a survey commissioned by Upwork and the Freelancers Union, revealed that 7 out of 10 freelancers polled said they would consider moving someplace other than a large city.\n\nAnd incentives could drive that number even higher, with just under half saying they would be willing to move to a city that offered tax breaks to freelancers.\n\nIndustry leaders have indicated they want to increase ties to America's Heartland, yet there are few signs this is happening in any significant way.\n\nIn December The Brookings Institute reported that their study of job creation in key digital segments found \"that while employment in tech is growing all over America,\" the sector has \"continued to concentrate in a shortlist of metros,\" such as San Francisco, Seattle and Los Angeles.", "description": "Many employees \u2014 unhappy with the skyrocketing housing costs, snarled traffic and pricey child care in urban areas such as San Francisco, New York, Seattle, LA and Boston \u2014 are beginning to flee in high numbers. To keep top talent, managers need to liberalize their policies and allow employees to live and work remotely from wherever they want.", "authors": ["Stephane Kasriel", "Ceo Of Upwork", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/06/17/102765008-GettyImages-173809400_[1].1910x1000.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
