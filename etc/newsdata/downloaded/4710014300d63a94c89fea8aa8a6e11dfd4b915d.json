(Hint: you were ready all along.)\n\nIt turns out that we\u2019ve got a pal in the animal kingdom who isn\u2019t all that different from us. Except that they\u2019re busy piling on the pounds, not losing them, and they do so in winter, not summer.\n\nOh and it\u2019s all for survival, not for the Instagram creds.\n\nKatmai National Park, located in southern Alaska, is currently in the grisliest part of their annual Fat Bear Week.\n\nIn a post titled \u2018River, river in the Fall, who\u2019s the fattest bear of all?\u2019, Katmai called upon the public to decide which of the bears in their park are the thiccest of the thicc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe national park is famed for its brown bear population, with around 2,200 of them inhabiting the area.\n\nNow in its fifth year, the 2019 contest kicked off on 2 October.

It\u2019s an epic weight gain that\u2019s all about strategy.\n\n\u2018Large amounts of body fat in brown bears is indicative of good health and strong chances of survival.
