Video streaming service Netflix is now also on the verge of displaying a very similar kind of hypocrisy.\n\nA few months ago, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, announced the company might pull its productions out of Georgia because the state had passed a pro-life heartbeat law. Furthermore, he promised Netflix would work with the ACLU to fight the law in court. Here\u2019s the NY Times report from May:\n\nIf unchallenged, the law will go into effect in January 2020. Should that happen, Netflix, which has productions in the state including the series \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cOzark,\u201d along with the coming film \u201cHolidate,\u201d is suggesting it might consider boycotting, too. \u201cWe have many women working on productions in Georgia, whose rights, along with millions of others, will be severely restricted by this law,\u201d Sarandos said in a statement released Monday, and first reported by Variety. \u201cIt\u2019s why we will work with the A.C.L.U. and others to fight it in court. Given the legislation has not yet been implemented, we\u2019ll continue to film there \u2014 while also supporting partners and artists who choose not to. Should it ever come into effect, we\u2019d rethink our entire investment in Georgia.\u201d\n\nToday, CNN Business reports that Netflix\u2019s stand on abortion won\u2019t play as well in some of the foreign locations where it is now producing shows. So the question is whether CNN will decide to stay silent on abortion when it does work abroad:\n\nThe company has been expanding its global footprint to places like the Middle East, where abortion access is restricted. Eventually, it will have a choice to make: does it apply those values consistently, or risk looking hypocritical? Netflix declined to make Sarandos available for an interview with CNN Business. But some think a strong stance in Georgia could put pressure on the company to apply the same standards globally\u2026 Even as it was putting out the statement about Georgia\u2019s heartbeat law, it announced a new show that would film in Egypt, which outlaws abortion unless a woman\u2019s life is at risk. It also has two original series filmed in Jordan, which severely restricts abortion rights as well. If the Georgia law eventually goes into effect and Sarandos and Netflix make good on the threat to pull out of the state, the company could open itself up to criticism for staying in regions like the Middle East. How will it draw those lines? Netflix did not respond for a request for comment on that question. \u201cAs we get into Netflix being available around the world, we get into human rights issues,\u201d Hardart said. \u201cGeorgia is a microcosm of what will happen around the world.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia heartbeat law was set to take effect on January 1, 2020, but a judge has blocked it. That was considered a win by Planned Parenthood and, presumably, by Netflix. But Planned Parenthood isn\u2019t opening abortion clinics in Egypt or Jordan. Netflix is filming shows there. So will the company attempt to pressure those governments as well or is this another case where woke politics stops at the border?\n\nThe fact that Netflix\u2019s Sarandos isn\u2019t interested in answer questions about it suggests to me he is probably watching the meltdown at the NBA and Blizzard Entertainment and has decided not to volunteer for the same treatment. But they can\u2019t dodge the question forever. It\u2019s absurd that major companies have to issue what amounts to foreign policy statements now, but that seems like an inevitable outcome when woke politics becomes a corporate focus.", "description": "\"Netflix did not respond for a request for comment...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Netflix.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
