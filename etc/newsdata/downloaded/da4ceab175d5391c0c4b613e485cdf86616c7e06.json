I know that,\" she told CBS News.\n\nBrunel offered her a drink after asking her to come back to his apartment to pick something up, she said, \"the next thing I remember was waking up in his bed and he was beside me.\"\n\n\"He was sleeping and I was naked,\" she told CBS. \"I was wondering how I got there.\"\n\nShe then described getting dressed in a panic before calling her friend Rafic and saying she couldn't find the door out of the apartment, so she would have to jump.\n\n\"He said, 'No, it\"s like four stories up,'\" she said. \"Luckily he was there to calm me down and everything because I would have jumped.\"\n\nRafic told CBS News that she \"was afraid, panicked\" when he saw her that night, and her face was \"not even pale, she was white.\"\n\n\"You never forget [the] expression on your friend\"s face when something like that happens,\" he added.\n\nThe woman said that at the time, she didn't report the alleged rape to police initially because she didn't speak French fluently and because she ultimately \"just wanted to forget everything.\" However, more than 30 years later when she learned that investigators were interested in Brunel and his possible connection to a sex crimes and conspiracy investigation into Epstein, she felt she had to come forward with her account.\n\nBrunel is a key figure in the Epstein investigation, years after several allegations were largely ignored\n\nCourtney Powell, a former model with an agency run by Jean Luc Brunel, poses for a picture at her home in Livermore, California on August 15, 2019.
