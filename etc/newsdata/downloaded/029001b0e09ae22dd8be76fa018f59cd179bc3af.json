It\u2019s not all doom and gloom,\u201d said Jeni Klugman, managing director of the Georgetown Institute and lead author of the index.\n\nGains were strongest in women\u2019s access to financial accounts, either mobile or at conventional banks, in fewer discriminatory laws and through increasing legislative representation.\n\n\u201cA national election can bring about big changes, both positive and negative,\u201d Klugman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n\u201cWe have a number of countries which boosted the share of women in their national legislatures. We also had several countries which went the other way,\u201d she added.\n\nIceland lost its top spot from 2017 after elections brought a drop in the number of women in parliament.\n\nThe United States inched up to No. 19 from No. 22 two years ago, in part due to 2018 elections when a record number of women were elected to Congress. But Klugman said the United States continues to lag in the area of domestic violence.\n\nThe research is intended to inform and inspire action, Klugman said, noting that the factors it weighed are integral to the global development goals adopted unanimously by the United Nations in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s something we invented out of thin air. It\u2019s something which is grounded in those long, hard-negotiated agreements, so we\u2019re holding them to account for that.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. adopted 17 goals, including gender equality and an end to hunger, poverty and other ills, to be achieved by 2030.\n\nThe new research found deterioration in women\u2019s lives was often linked to security, which worsened in almost 50 countries.\n\nAs to legal reforms, Moldova moved up 22 places owing to changes in its sexual assault laws.\n\nSaudi Arabia persisted in having the most extensive legal discrimination against women, followed by Yemen, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates and Syria.\n\nThe report said legal discrimination means about 2.7 billion women globally are restricted from working in the same jobs as men.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "Norway at top, Yemen at bottom of rankings for women's quality of life", "authors": ["Ellen Wulfhorst", "Thomson Reuters Foundation"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/toronto.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
