It will then take another month before he can be dealt with.\n\nThe court heard George, who lives yards from ex-football manager Harry Redknapp, caused trouble during an afternoon drinking at the yacht club on September 20.\n\nHe became annoyed when staff refused to serve him anymore alcohol as he appeared intoxicated.\n\nHe then lifted up his cardigan and flashed at them the handle of a pistol that was tucked into the waistband of his shorts.\n\nHe told the barman 'don't be a pussy, give me a drink', the court heard. Shocked staff gave George a glass of prosecco before calling the police when he left the bar area.\n\nGeorge was arrested at his family's home 140 yards from the yacht club on Sandbanks (above)\n\nRyan Senevirante, prosecuting, said: 'He returned to the club at 3.30pm, went to the bar and showed he had something tucked into his waistband.\n\n'He was told he could not have a gun but he replied 'don't be a pussy, give me a drink'. The police were then called but the defendant had left by then.'\n\nGeorge, the son of wealthy market owner Brendan George, was arrested at his family's \u00a32million harbourside home 140 yards from the yacht club a short time later.\n\nThe incident was attended by armed police who conducted a search of the area, including George's home.\n\nTerry Scanlan, defending, said: 'Mr George was in possession of a toy gun and he admits he lifted his cardigan up so staff were aware of it. However he does not believe there is any linkage between this and his request for alcohol.'\n\nMr Scanlan said that while his client is away he will see a doctor three times a week to treat 'alcohol-related issues'. George will be sentenced on December 4.", "description": "Oliver George, 26, of Sandbanks, Dorset, appeared in court over the drunken yacht club fracas two days before he and his family are due to fly to the Caribbean where they have a home.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/10/19483654-0-image-a-5_1570614082054.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
