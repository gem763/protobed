He explained the law changes to the jury of eight men and four women.\n\n\"Some of you may be aware that the law was changed in Northern Ireland at midnight on Monday whereby the sections under which she was charged were repealed,\" he said.\n\n\"In addition to that, Parliament directed that any ongoing charges in relation to those sections should be discontinued.\"\n\nThe judge said for those reasons the prosecution would not proceed. Crown barrister Kate McKay also referenced the terms of new law as she confirmed the end of the prosecution.\n\n\"The prosecution offers no evidence in this case,\" she said. The judge then told jurors to find the accused \"not guilty by direction\". He then confirmed the woman was formally discharged by the court.\n\nWhile no evidence was presented during the criminal proceedings, the circumstances of the case were outlined last year in a separate High Court challenge taken by the woman.\n\nJudgment has yet to be delivered in that judicial review, in which the mother claimed the decision to prosecute her contravened her human rights.\n\nDuring those proceedings, the woman's barrister told the court her daughter was \"extremely vulnerable\" at the time of her pregnancy, claiming her then ex-boyfriend was \"physically and emotionally abusive\" toward her.\n\nThe lawyer said the GCSE student had gone to her local doctor a week after taking the abortion medication.\n\nHer court heard she was subsequently referred to a mental health counselling service, which in turn informed Social Services. Social Services then alerted the Police Service of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe barrister told the High Court investigating police officers then arrived at the child's school and removed her from a classroom to speak to her in the absence of her parents.\n\nAfter her acquittal on Wednesday, the woman's solicitor, Jemma Conlon, of Chambers Solicitors, said: \"Today is a day of immense relief for my client, who now finds herself free from the burden of this prosecution that has been in her life for six years.\n\n\"It is a day that she will forever remember and a day that allows her to finally move on with her life privately without anguish and criminalisation.\"\n\nOutside court, Grainne Teggart, from Amnesty International, which had been supporting the woman, said the outcome was evidence of a new \"compassionate\" legal framework in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"Today we are relieved that she can go back to being a mother,\" she said.\n\n\"What we are seeing today is our new abortion law taking effect. No longer will women be hauled through the courts and treated as criminals for accessing this healthcare service.\n\n\"This is the beginning of a new era for Northern Ireland - a more caring and compassionate Northern Ireland. This mother is now free to move on from this ordeal and go back to her family.\"\n\nThe Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019 which decriminalised abortion also paved the way for the introduction of same-sex marriage in the region, with the first weddings expected in February.\n\nThe Act also includes provisions for a new pension paid to injured victims of the Troubles.", "description": "A Northern Ireland woman acquitted of buying abortion pills for her daughter following a landmark law change has expressed relief she can now \u201cfinally move on with her life\u201d.
