The two men exited the room, walked quickly toward their phalanx of security vehicles down the long corridor and jumped into the same town car.\n\n\n\nThe security team saw their bosses were set and did the same. With that, they were off, a procession headed into the darkening evening with only one topic that mattered to discuss: What is the future for head coach Jay Gruden?\n\n\n\nIn the locker room, players changed and showered and packed their gear. They have no idea who their coach will be on Monday morning any more than we do. It's not their job to make that decision and their opinion probably wouldn't matter anyway.\n\n\n\n\"We're professionals. We have a long season ahead,\" said linebacker Ryan Kerrigan, who has played for three coaches in Washington. \"We still have 11 games left. Those games are going to be there no matter what our record is right now.\"\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the room, running back Chris Thompson fielded the same question. A fifth-round draft pick from Florida State in 2013, Thompson was in danger of washing out of the NFL. A shoulder injury ended his rookie season. He was cut at the very end of training camp in 2014 and spent almost that entire season on the practice squad.\n\n\n\nBut the Redskins stuck with Thompson and by 2015 he was a key part of an NFC East championship team. He's been a major part of the offense ever since. Gruden was one who kept faith with Thompson. Think the players don't care or have quit on Gruden? Thompson spoke through tears, wiping his red eyes repeatedly as his words came in fits and starts.\n\n\n\n\"I feel like he was one of the guys that really believed in me and wanted me to stay here and be with him through his whole legacy here as a coach,\" Thompson said. \"Going through that practice squad year was real tough for me\u2026It's tough, man.\"\n\n\n\nOther players were more stoic. Josh Norman lamented the loss, the 0-5 record, the sense that this era of Redskins football is about to change drastically. He came here to play for a contender like the one he was with in Carolina. It hasn't happened. It doesn't seem it will.\n\n\n\n\"That's not a question I can answer,\" Norman said when asked about Gruden's status. \"That's dealing with up top. I'm not going to put myself in that situation and comment on that. That's got to deal with people that's up at the top of the office who make those decisions. We just play the game.\"\n\n\n\nThe Redskins next play at the Miami Dolphins, who are themselves winless (0-4) and desperate. The difference? Miami is intentionally rebuilding. Washington thought it could contend for an NFC playoff spot even when seven-time Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams refused to report to the team and Pro Bowl tight end Jordan Reed was struck down by another head injury and concussion symptoms. Neither man has played a game this season and might not.\n\n\n\nFor his part, Gruden was philosophical. He's been that way his entire time in Washington, five full seasons and five games, the longest tenured coach since Snyder bought the team 20 years ago. There are no staff changes he's considering. It's too late for any of that five games into the season. If his bosses want to keep Gruden around, they will make their preference known soon enough.\n\n\n\nGruden loves to coach. It's his life and his chosen profession. But he's always tried to break the fourth wall when grilled by reporters or critics on this specific decision or that. It is still just a game, a sport, one worth devoting hours of time to, but not one to take so damn seriously. He's endured prior controversies throughout his time with the Redskins with a shrug of the shoulders. You just keep grinding until they tell you to move on. That time might finally be coming. Gruden isn't worried about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nobody's told me anything. I don't have a concern,\" Gruden said. \"I'll just wait and see if my key works on Monday, keep working, go attack the Miami Dolphins and go and get our first win next week.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMORE REDSKINS NEWS:\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJay Grudens job status uncertain after Redskins fall to 0-5 with loss to Patriots originally appeared on NBC Sports Washington", "description": "\"Nobody's told me anything.
