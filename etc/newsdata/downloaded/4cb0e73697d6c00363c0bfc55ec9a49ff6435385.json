It\u2019s not just Houston Rockets games that have been banned from Chinese airwaves over Daryl Morey\u2019s pro-Hong-Kong tweet, after all. It\u2019s the entire NBA preseason.\n\nSo imagine what the consequences might be for Disney\u2019s operations in China, starting with access to Chinese movie theaters for Disney films, if ESPN began applying a little of its famous wokeness towards China\u2019s regard for human rights.\n\nSome network employees are playing dumb about any change in the network\u2019s coverage of this subject\u2026\n\nWtf are you talking about? We had Mnf game and 4 mlb playoff games. We follow an nba game tomorrow and I want to cover this when we have some real estate to cover it. \u2014 Scott Van Pelt (@notthefakeSVP) October 8, 2019\n\n\u2026but Deadspin has the goods in the form of a memo sent to staff by ESPN\u2019s senior news director urging them not to delve into details about the dispute between China and Hong Kong. Congrats to the network, I guess, on finally discovering a political topic that it doesn\u2019t want to opine on.\n\nThe memo doesn\u2019t ask staff to take China\u2019s side in the Hong Kong debate but, wouldn\u2019t you know it, according to Deadspin much of the commentary thus far has been critical of Morey and scrupulously neutral on the sensitive subject of whether Hong Kongers deserve basic due process rights.\n\nIf you paid attention to ESPN channels yesterday, you saw the network repeatedly attempt to grapple with the story of Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey creating an international incident after tweeting and then deleting his support for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong. You heard talking head after talking head castigate Morey for sending the tweet, speculation over whether he\u2019d keep his job, speculation about the sincerity of his convictions, discussions about what this meant for the Rockets\u2019 bottom line, the observation that it\u2019s unreasonable to expect for-profit companies like the NBA to act morally, and the non-take that cowing to China is simply the cost of doing business in China\u2026 Chuck Salituro, the senior news director of ESPN, sent a memo to shows mandating that any discussion of the Daryl Morey story avoid any political discussions about China and Hong Kong, and instead focus on the related basketball issues. The memo, obtained by Deadspin, explicitly discouraged any political discussion about China and Hong Kong. Multiple ESPN sources confirmed to Deadspin that network higher-ups were keeping a close eye on how the topic was discussed on ESPN\u2019s airwaves\u2026 Any summary of the tensions between China and Hong Kong is going to be necessarily reductive, but a summary of what\u2019s actually going on at least provides basic context for the rest of the discussion. The idea that Chinese politics are simply too complex to talk about on sports TV just isn\u2019t convincing.\n\nESPN has toned down its on-air politicking over the past 18 months after justified complaints from righties that the network had adopted a conspicuously \u201cwoke\u201d identity. Too much politics, not enough sports, viewers claimed. Jemele Hill, their most outspoken host, was moved off the SportsCenter desk and the network\u2019s president vowed to stick to the thing that ESPN became famous for in the first place. But there was an exception to that policy: Obviously, some sports stories do involve politics. If the network is going to cover Colin Kaepernick\u2019s collusion grievance against the NFL, for instance, it has to discuss the claim that he\u2019s been blackballed for refusing to stand during the anthem.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s quagmire in China is a textbook example of that sports/politics intersection, notes Deadspin. If you can\u2019t cover Kaepernick\u2019s legal battle with the NFL without discussing the underlying details, how can you discuss the NBA\u2019s standoff with China without addressing the merits of Morey\u2019s pro-Hong-Kong tweet? Political context is crucial to letting viewers decide which party is in the right, which depends in part on their assessment of the righteousness of the cause in Hong Kong. Did Morey say something so egregious that China, and the NBA, are entitled to be angry with him, and the Rockets to fire him? Or is China trying to censor an anodyne expression of support for a pro-democracy movement, aided and abetted by propaganda pushed by American corporations that fear loss of access to the Chinese market?\n\nIf American sports figures are being unjustly pressured to genuflect to Chinese communist sensibilities, that seems like a story. I wonder why Disney-owned ESPN, which also happens to have a deal with Chinese tech leviathan Tencent, isn\u2019t eager to tell it.\n\nAt Slate, Tom Scocca says it\u2019s time for the NBA to pull the plug on China. It\u2019ll only get worse from here, not better.\n\nThe message of a spiel like Tsai\u2019s is that foreign institutions can coexist with the Chinese government on mutual terms of respect, as long as those institutions honor the boundaries around China\u2019s nonnegotiable sensitivities. The truth, though, is that those boundaries are constantly moving. Ever since the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which were supposed to celebrate China\u2019s full integration into the international order, the government has been aggressively tightening the limits, confident that the terms of engagement mean foreign entities will have to go along\u2014whether it\u2019s a matter of putting Communist Party officials onto university boards, or stifling news coverage of leadership\u2019s self-enrichment, or censoring a movie, or removing apps from the Chinese market\u2026 China has already played its hand. If Hong Kong is nonnegotiable, there\u2019s nothing to discuss. The subject will become more sensitive, not less, if the Hong Kong police move from tear gas and rubber bullets to the routine use of live ammunition, or if the People\u2019s Liberation Army moves in. Would the NBA muzzle its employees then? Would the players and staff of a globally prominent American company censor their own feelings to protect the Chinese market? Why not take the stand before it gets to that?\n\nIf you want a firsthand look at how pitiful ESPN\u2019s coverage can be, go watch the Deadspin video of Stephen A. Smith ranting yesterday \u2014 not about Chinese human-rights abuses, not about the NBA groveling and risking cooptation by a totalitarian state in the name of making a buck, but about Morey\u2019s alleged selfishness in not thinking of the Rockets\u2019 bottom line before tweeting. Coming soon to the Stephen A. Smith Show, I presume: The Uighur menace. Could it happen here? Stay tuned.\u201d Ironically, one person who has acquitted herself well in all this is \u2014 ta da \u2014 Jemele Hill, who has a piece at the Atlantic today taking the NBA to task for its hypocrisy. If the league is going to speak up in defense of NBA players\u2019 right to protest social injustice, she insists, it needs to speak up in defense of Daryl Morey\u2019s right to do the same.
