And so too did the rest of the Nationals.\n\nAs a result, they are now one win away from the World Series.\n\nStrasburg fanned 12 batters over seven innings and Washington hammered the St. Louis Cardinals in a 8-1 victory to take a 3-0 series lead in the National League Championship Series.\n\nThe Nationals used a four-run third inning, while tacking on additional runs in the fifth, sixth and seventh to put the Cardinals on the brink of elimination.\n\nBeyond Strasburg\u2019s dominance, Adam Eaton, Anthony Rendon, Howie Kendrick, Ryan Zimmerman and Victor Robles all batted in runs \u2014 creating a bigger cushion than Washington had enjoyed in the first two games of the NLCS.\n\nIn St. Louis, the Nationals dominated the Cardinals with elite performances from Anibal Sanchez and Max Scherzer. Each starter carried a no-hitter into at least the seventh inning and both gave up only one hit.\n\nStrasburg, though, didn\u2019t disappoint.\n\nFrom the moment celebrity announcer Michael Buffer announced \u201cLet\u2019s get ready to rumble\u201d to get Game 3 officially underway, Strasburg was dialed in. The 31-year-old needed just 10 pitches to retire the side to begin the game.\n\nAnd while the suspense of a no-hitter ended early \u2014 Marcell Ozuna doubled to left in the second \u2014 it didn\u2019t matter. Strasburg took care of the next three at-bats, including catching Ozuna in a rundown between second and third to record an out.\n\nThe Nationals, however, haven\u2019t gotten to this point with only excellent pitching. They\u2019ve been solid in the field, dating back to spring training when manager Dave Martinez stressed the importance of fundamentals. They\u2019ve become a buzzsaw offensively, especially in the playoffs.\n\nAnd on Monday, Washington\u2019s offensive explosion started in the third.\n\nEaton got the Nationals on the board with a two-out double to score Robles. The score was the start of a four-run rally, which included RBI doubles from Rendon and Howie Kendrick.\n\nUntil then, Cardinals starter Jack Flaherty had previously gone 18 consecutive starts without allowing more than three runs.\n\nSt. Louis scored its lone run in the seventh.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
