Just today, a new study of 19 major retailers revealed how much plastic can really be found in Halloween costumes.\n\nAccording to environmental charity Hubbub and The Fairyland Trust, a nature charity, 83% of materials in 324 clothing lines are made from oil-based plastic \u2013 that\u2019s the equivalent of 83 million plastic bottles.\n\nThe problem only gets bigger when we consider other plastic items that we buy especially for Halloween, such as decorations, cups and cutlery for house parties, plastic wrappers on sweet treats and the overflow of pumpkins (which will never get eaten).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s enough to give anyone eco-anxiety, but there are ways to have a sustainable Halloween.\n\nMake your own costumes or swap with friends\n\nLet\u2019s start with the biggest problem: the costumes.\n\nA lot of people will invest in a new outfit every year and variety is the spice of life, but rather than buying one from the shop, take a look around your house and see if there\u2019s anything you can use to make your own costume.\n\nIt\u2019ll not only be better for the environment, but you\u2019ll also save money.\n\nIf you\u2019re not great with a sewing machine or a glue gun, round up your mates and host a \u2018swap\u2019 party. This way, you get rid of Halloween costumes that you don\u2019t want and, hopefully, score a free outfit from someone else.\n\nShare your Halloween makeup kits\n\nMost Halloween makeup kits include more than one colour or item.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re going as a skeleton and don\u2019t need the red paint on the palette, why not give it to your mate, who is dressing as the devil?\n\nGet ready together and share your Halloween goods, including fake blood.\n\nBuy one big pack, instead of a lot of small ones, because as much as you tell yourself that you\u2019ll \u2018save it for next year\u2019, it\u2019ll most likely end up in the bin the morning after.\n\nGet pick-n-mix for trick-or-treaters\n\nOne of the biggest joys of Halloween is the treat-or-treat round in the neighbourhood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost supermarkets sell extra large tubs of sweets for the occasion, but this can often involve a lot of excess plastic.\n\nInstead of getting that huge bag of sweets, filled with smaller bags of sweets, buy pick-n-mix that you can choose yourself.\n\nYou could also bring your own tub, and ask the store if they\u2019d be OK with you using that instead of their paper or plastic bags.\n\nAlso, check the ingredients of the sweets and consider buying non-GMO products where possible.\n\nRecycle your pumpkin\n\nAfter they\u2019ve created their masterpiece, most people will throw out the pumpkin pulp \u2013 don\u2019t.\n\nYou can use it to make soups, pies and other culinary delights.\n\nDon\u2019t fancy eating this particular orange vegetable? Make yourself a face mask instead.\n\nAs for the pumpkin, don\u2019t just chuck it in with your regular trash \u2013 put it into a compost bin.\n\nAlternatively, if you have a garden, you can bury it. We\u2019re not being morbid for the sake of Halloween; according to Recycle Nation, the pumpkin pieces will break down and \u2018enrich the soil\u2019.\n\nAlso, if live near a farmer\u2019s market, you could potentially reduce your carbon footprint by purchasing local produce.\n\nIf you\u2019re having a party, make it sustainable\n\nOdds are that if the host encourages guests to be sustainable, they will.\n\nGive away a prize for the most environmentally-friendly outfit, buy biodegradable cups and plates (if you really need them) and make your own decorations.\n\nIf you\u2019re using lights, try to source those that are better for the environment and recycle any batteries responsibly once they run out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou could even ask your friends to walk or cycle to your house, and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nHaving said that, if they are drinking or going home on their at the end of the evening, tell them to leave their bike overnight and take a cab instead.\n\nHalloween doesn\u2019t need to be a wasteful holiday.\n\nJust make some small changes \u2013 it could make a big difference.\n\nMORE: How to make a homemade face mask from your leftover pumpkin pulp\n\nMORE: Mum dresses up in a different Halloween costume every day to pick kids up from school\n\nMORE: Fashion Nova is selling sexy Toy Story costumes for Halloween and there goes your childhood\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "We reveal five ways you can have a more environmentally-friendly Halloween, from reducing plastic use to burying your pumpkin.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bask-in-the-sunshine-but-remember-that-you-have-global-warming-to-thank-for-it-d40e-ca29_1571412434.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
