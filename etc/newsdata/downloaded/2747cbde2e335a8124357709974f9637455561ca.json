(Photo: Courtesy of Lindsay Agbalokwu)\n\nA teacher gave birth on the sidewalk outside her school, with the assistance of her principal and dean of students.\n\nLindsay Agbalokwu was due with her second baby on September 17th, so when the Colorado mom woke up on Tuesday with cramps, she wrote them off as Braxton Hicks (small contractions that don\u2019t necessarily indicate early labor).\n\nSo Agbalokwu drove to work at DSST: Conservatory Green in Denver, where she teaches reading to middle school students, and hoped for the best. The 33-year-old had a busy day ahead teaching and handing out core value awards. But after the ceremony, when Agbalokwu went to her 6th-grade homeroom class, her cramps strengthened.\n\n\u201cThe pain felt different,\u201d the teacher tells Yahoo Lifestyle. Agbalokwu asked co-teacher Marissa Kast to cover her classroom and to alert principal Natalie Lewis and dean of students Chris Earls, while she used the bathroom.\n\n\u201cIn the classroom, the pain went from zero to 100,\u201d Agbalokwu tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nLewis and Earls walked Agbalokwu outside the building while she debated calling her mother for help. \u201cI said, \u2018We should call 911 \u2014 I think the baby is coming,\u201d says the teacher.\n\nFortunately, Kast had a sleeping bag in her car, so she laid it down on the sidewalk while Lewis called for an ambulance.\n\n\u201cI lay down and we put the dispatcher on speaker phone, who started giving delivery instructions to Natalie and Chris,\u201d Agbalokwu tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nAfter a few \u201cterribly painful minutes\u201d during which Lewis coached Agbalokwu with encouragement, a fire truck pulled up to the school and emergency workers took over.\n\nBaby Zara was born immediately and the mother and daughter were driven to the hospital. Agbalokwu is now home with Zara, her husband, and their 17-month-old son.\n\n\u201cI was in so much pain, I didn\u2019t care that these people are my bosses \u2014 they are both parents,\u201d Agbalokwu tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThey were my support people.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The pregnant Denver teacher had no choice but to lie down on the sidewalk in front of school.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LrzRVUn1OVkT3g2yCv2qNA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9NzUwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/394b3570-d1a5-11e9-ba39-98e7ab55422c", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
