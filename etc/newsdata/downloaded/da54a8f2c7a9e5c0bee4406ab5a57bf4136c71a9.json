(Alex Wroblewski/Reuters)\n\nCaught in another apparent lie about her personal history, Warren offered another vague response \u2014 and her allies in the press dutifully bought it.\n\nAbout a week ago, David Byler of the Washington Post irritated Elizabeth Warren fans and some members of the media by arguing that \u201cmany journalists either match the demographic profile of her base or live around people who do. . . . Warren\u2019s view of politics closely matches the prevailing media view of what politics \u2018should\u2019 be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs if to prove Byler\u2019s point, days later the Washington Free Beacon published a damaging scoop about the end of Warren\u2019s early 1970s tenure as a grade-school teacher in Riverdale, N.J., and the mainstream media circled their wagons.\n\nOn the campaign trail and social media, Warren has claimed that her employment in Riverdale was effectively ended by her pregnancy, using the anecdote as a way of connecting with female voters:\n\nWhen I was 22 and finishing my first year of teaching, I had an experience millions of women will recognize. By June I was visibly pregnant\u2014and the principal told me the job I'd already been promised for the next year would go to someone else. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 8, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s a neat story \u2014 as it turns out, a little too neat. The Free Beacon went back and found the minutes of the Riverdale Board of Education\u2019s 1971 meetings, which make clear that in April of that year, the board unanimously offered her a second-year contract, and that in June, her resignation was \u201caccepted with regret.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Beacon reporter Collin Anderson reached out to the Warren campaign for a response, it didn\u2019t offer one. Instead, it talked to CBS News, which published a piece the next day with the headline, \u201cElizabeth Warren stands by account of being pushed out of her first teaching job because of pregnancy.\u201d\n\nThe article began by repeating Warren\u2019s account of being fired for being pregnant, and adds that \u201crecently, several media outlets have questioned the veracity of these claims.\u201d Way down in the eleventh paragraph, it finally elaborates: \u201cThe Washington Free Beacon reported on a transcript from contemporaneous local school board meetings, also obtained by CBS News.\u201d\n\nThe other wrinkle in Warren\u2019s account is that, as the Beacon noted, in 2007 she did an interview at UC Berkeley and described her departure from the school differently:\n\nMy first year post-graduation I worked in a public-school system with the children with disabilities. I did that for a year, and then that summer I didn\u2019t have the education courses, so I was on an \u201cemergency certificate,\u201d it was called. I went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me.\u201d I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years.\n\nThe Beacon reported that the November 1970 Riverdale school-board minutes \u201cconfirm Warren\u2019s account that she was working on an \u2018emergency\u2019 teaching certificate, showing unanimous approval \u2018that a provisional certificate be requested for Mrs. Elizabeth Warren in speech therapy.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn response, the campaign offered this vague explanatory statement from the candidate to CBS News: \u201cAfter becoming a public figure I opened up more about different pieces in my life and this was one of them. I wrote about it in my book when I became a U.S. Senator.\u201d In other words, Warren would have us believe that in 2007, while speaking at Berkeley as a tenured Harvard Law School professor, a former vice president of the American Law Institute, the author of a critically acclaimed book, and a prominent commentator on economic and legal issues, she felt uncomfortable saying that she had been dismissed from her first job for being pregnant. Did she think the Berkeley crowd was going to take the side of the school administrators? Did she think they were going to boo her?\n\nIn addition to burying the Beacon\u2019s scoop in its own story and dutifully relaying Warren\u2019s vague response, CBS attempted to \u201cadd\u201d to the story by talking to a pair of retired teachers who said that maybe it could have happened.\n\nTwo retired teachers who worked at Riverdale Elementary for over 30 years, including the year Warren was there, told CBS News that they don\u2019t remember anyone being explicitly fired due to pregnancy during their time at the school. But Trudy Randall and Sharon Ercalano each said that a non-tenured, pregnant employee like Warren would have had little job security at Riverdale in 1971, seven years before the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was passed.\n\nNo one, of course, is arguing that it\u2019s impossible a Riverdale teacher could\u2019ve been dismissed for being pregnant in 1971; they\u2019re merely questioning, with good reason, whether that\u2019s what happened in Warren\u2019s case \u2014 whether she is inaccurately describing a moment she claims, over and over again, was a turning point in her life. The version of the story Warren told at Berkeley \u2014 that she decided that pursuing a career in childhood education just wasn\u2019t for her \u2014 isn\u2019t all that dramatic or likely to win voters\u2019 sympathy. The version she\u2019s taken to telling on the campaign trail \u2014 that she was a good teacher helping needy children before a sexist school board broke its promise and fired her because she was pregnant \u2014 is quite the opposite.\n\nAt best, we\u2019ve got the candidate who\u2019s arguably the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination changing her story about her first job; at worst, she\u2019s rewriting her personal history to paint herself as a victim of sinister patriarchal forces because it makes for a better and more politically useful narrative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo the extent the mainstream media discussed this story, it mostly expressed anger that the Free Beacon dared to question Warren\u2019s version of events. The Washington Post\u2019s Margaret Sullivan called it a \u201cnarrowly factual\u201d \u201cunfair\u201d \u201csmear.\u201d Eric Lach of The New Yorker sniffed that \u201cthe Free Beacon didn\u2019t have a scoop; it had an innuendo.\u201d Vogue declared, \u201cIf you think Elizabeth Warren is lying, you\u2019ve never been a woman in the workplace.\u201d (This will be quite a surprise to Free Beacon editor-in-chief Eliana Johnson.) PolitiFact just couldn\u2019t come up with any conclusion, other than \u201cAt the time, it was common for women to be forced out of teaching jobs after they became pregnant.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the not-so-accurate tales of her Native American heritage, the \u201cwell, it could have happened that way\u201d defense isn\u2019t good enough.", "description": "Caught in another apparent lie about her personal history, Elizabeth Warren offered another vague response.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Victor Davis Hanson", "John Mccormack", "A.
