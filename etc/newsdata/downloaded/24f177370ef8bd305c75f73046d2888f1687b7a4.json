These are all things we know. But we are here today to talk about what we do not know. And what we do not know is what on God\u2019s green Earth is happening in this video of Millie Bobby Brown demoing her new skin-care line. We are not trying to contribute to the aforementioned online bullying (she is still a revelation onscreen, perhaps even more so after this video). We truly just need answers.\n\nHere are the basics: Millie Bobby Brown launched a new skin-care line for teen girls called Florence by Mills. Great, cool, terrific. Nothing strange yet. As part of the rollout of her brand, she posted a video of herself testing the products as part of her nighttime skin-care routine. Again, totally normal and good. In the video, she sprays on a face mist before removing her makeup, which is a little odd as far as skin-care routines go, but whatever. Fine.\n\nBut then, she tells us she is using a scrub on her face. She even tells us she is excited to use this scrub. Around the 30 second mark, she begins to \u201capply\u201d the \u201cscrub.\u201d Reader, I need you to watch the video and confirm to me that Millie Bobby Brown is not applying anything to her face. Her hands are dry. Her face is dry. She is rubbing her bare, dry hands on her face. Not even this generation\u2019s greatest young actress could convince me I am watching someone scrub their skin with air.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s just poor camera quality, or the scrub is translucent and does not photograph well.\u201d I would encourage you to watch the rest of the video. She goes on to \u201capply\u201d a \u201cface wash\u201d and later, a \u201cmoisturizer.\u201d There is no visible product on her face or hands at any point. Throughout the video she tells us (very convincingly) how lovely the products feel on her skin. She is so enthusiastic, in fact, you almost believe her. Almost.\n\nWhat is Millie Bobby Brown trying to tell us here? Is this performance art? Is this an elaborate advertisement for the fourth season of Stranger Things? Have I lost my mind? Or is Millie Bobby Brown\u2019s nighttime skin routine a kind of moving Rorschach test, in which each viewer might see what they want to see in the blurry iPhone footage that will haunt my dreams for days to come? Watch and judge for yourselves.\n\nUpdate, September 12, 12 p.m.: Hello, Notes app, our old friend. Millie Bobby Brown noted her disappoint at the reactions to her skin-care content in a little Notes app note, posted on Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m still learning the best way to share my routines as I get to know this space better \u2014 I\u2019m not an expert,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI thought doing a quick video replicating my personal process for that night was okay, but that\u2019s not what was conveyed.\u201d The Stranger Things star added that she appreciated everyone\u2019s feedback. We certainly haven\u2019t seen the last of beauty guru Millie Bobby Brown.", "description": "In a demo video for her new skin-care line, Millie Bobbie Brown appears to apply air to her skin instead of any actual product.", "authors": ["Charu Sinha"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/11-millie-bobbi-brown.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
