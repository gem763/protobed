(Photo: Blumhouse)\n\nStanding drunk on a beach, looking out at the ocean, filmmaker JD Dillard suddenly had the idea for his next movie.\n\n\u201cI went to a wedding in Virginia Beach and there had been some drinking,\u201d Dilliard told Gizmodo at Fantastic Fest last month. \u201cI was down at the beach for a little bit, just looking out to the water had the very peculiar, and partially drunken, thought that the scariest possible thing ever would be something standing up and looking at me.\u201d\n\nThe thought inspired one of the key moments in Sweetheart, Dillard\u2019s second film which is available on digital and on-demand today. It stars Kiersey Clemons as Jenn, a young woman who somehow finds herself stranded on a deserted island. Then, as you can tell by Dillard\u2019s initial idea, Jenn quickly realises she isn\u2019t alone.\n\nOn its own, the idea obviously sounds very familiar. You\u2019ve seen that movie. You\u2019ve seen that TV show. But Sweetheart distinguishes itself from movies like Cast Away or TV shows like Lost in a number of key ways.\n\n\u201cAt that time, [I was] having a violent overreaction to exposition,\u201d Dillard said. \u201cSo much genre is just laden with tomes and books of rules. And we\u2019re like \u2018OK, let\u2019s think about a genre experience where there\u2019s none of that. There\u2019s just none, none, none of that. So the movie being spartan was definitely an early thought.\u201d\n\nAs Sweetheart begins, we know nothing about Jenn. It\u2019s just her, on an island, walking around and looking for stuff. Not only was this Dillard\u2019s \u201cmiddle finger to exposition\u201d but, hopefully, it puts audiences in a very unique mindset.\n\n\u201cI think one of the most underutilised parts in the story is that moment in the first act [when] the movie hasn\u2019t committed to you what it is,\u201d Dillard said. \u201cWhen the movie could truly be anything. There\u2019s a very specific thrill when you\u2019re trying to put the pieces together. And, within Sweetheart, there are little nuggets, little pieces of evidence that could send us in two different stories.\u201d\n\nNo matter which path the film took, the one constant was Dillard was always set on having black woman as the lead. \u201cMy crusade for the rest of my life is letting people who don\u2019t normally get to do the cool things in a movie get to do the cool things. Which is a roundabout way of representation,\u201d he said. \u201cKnowing that yeah, ok, I\u2019m gonna put a black woman at the lead. My sisters love horror movies, weirdly, more than I do, considering I just made one. But they don\u2019t have many...the list is short of black women killing the creature.\u201d\n\nClemons, either admiring the location or about to be scared shitless, in Sweetheart. (Photo: Blumhouse)\n\nSo the pieces were set. Filming would take place on location in Fiji and Blumhouse, which was about to release Dillard\u2019s first film Sleight, was producing. As the story tightened though, the idea of information, an idea Dillard was so against at the start, began to become increasingly important. How much information could they reveal? What would that information mean?\n\n\u201cWe say we\u2019re not a movie about exposition but we have to deploy it and tried to take those steps carefully,\u201d he said. \u201cNot have too much, but not have too little that [it] feels super, obnoxiously vague.\u201d In the end, Dillard admitted \u201cOther than the creature, the other big battle is exposition,\u201d which is both figurative and, surprisingly, literal too.\n\nAnother battle, albeit it a less crucial one, was the film\u2019s title. Sweetheart wasn\u2019t always \u201cSweetheart.\u201d In fact, for most of the production, there wasn\u2019t a title at all. It was just called \u201cIsland\u201d as a place holder. But, at a certain point, a single word in the script, delivered in just the right way by just the right person at just the right time, began to stand out as the only way to go.\n\n\u201cI love the idea we could obscure the expectation of what this was about by just not calling it like \u2018Alone\u2019 or \u2018Not Alone\u2019 or \u2018Deep\u2019 or whatever. Insert generic horror title here,\u201d Dillard said. \u201cAnd when we realised that the movie was about being believed, about Jenn trying to break out of this understanding that other people have about who she is, we realised very quickly that Sweetheart was there [in the script] and accidentally this term of containment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of containment though, despite stellar reviews from its Sundance Film Festival debut and recent Fantastic Fest run, Blumhouse and Universal Pictures, are not giving Sweetheart a theatrical release. The news that broke mere hours before Dillard and io9 sat down together last month.\n\nDillard on location in Fiji. (Photo: Blumhouse)\n\n\u201cWe made this movie wanting it to be in theatres,\u201d Dillard said. \u201cThat said, for me, with my North Star always being putting faces that I haven\u2019t seen in the movies that I love, access becomes the most important piece. So knowing that there will be so little resistance to access is important to me and knowing that everybody is able to see it and they can see it immediately and quickly and just because the maths is there [that] more people will get to see it...\u201d\n\nDillard talks a bit more, then pauses and changes course.\n\n\u201cLook, I got to make a movie and that\u2019s the most important piece for me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the movie is finished and is available but seeing it with an audience last night [at Fantastic Fest] you\u2019re like \u2018Well, hey the [shot I imagined on that beach in 2017] looks nice 12.19m-wide. [laughs] And you would hope more people get that opportunity. But I don\u2019t say that with savage disappointment or anything. It kind of is what it is. But I\u2019m glad people are going to be able to see it.\u201d\n\nAnd see Sweetheart, you absolutely, positively, should. It is now available on-demand and for digital download.", "description": "Standing drunk on a beach, looking out at the ocean, filmmaker JD Dillard suddenly had the idea for his next movie....", "authors": ["Alex Choros", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/kdrnkwngqmqaccc44hxg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
