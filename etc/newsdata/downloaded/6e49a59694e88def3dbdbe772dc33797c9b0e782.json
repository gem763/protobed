Thousands of our Great Soldiers have died or been badly wounded. Millions of people have died on the other side. GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE.....\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s actually a Trump tweet from Wednesday. But the tone doesn\u2019t vary from what he was saying in 2016. Apparently his Caps Lock key has been stuck for all that time as well.\n\nThat The Donald is finally following through on his promises should be no great surprise to the politicians and the pundits.\n\nNonetheless, Trump is getting it from both sides. His decision to pull U.S. troops out of the border zone in the Kurdish-occupied part of Syria has been blasted by Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Senate President Mitch McConnell.\n\nBut one New Jersey politician who was Trump\u2019s first major supporter in the 2016 race said he thinks Trump\u2019s decision is a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic that he\u2019s finally starting to get us out of the Mideast,\u201d said state Sen. Mike Doherty.\n\nThe Warren County Republican, who is a West Point grad and former Army officer, said The Donald\u2019s foreign policy was the main reason he supported him over Kentucky Senator Rand Paul in the 2016 GOP primaries.\n\n\u201cI supported Donald Trump over Rand Paul because Donald Trump was the closest candidate to Ron Paul when it came to foreign policy and stopping military adventures all over the world,\u201d he said.\n\nRon Paul is the former Texas congressman who shocked the Republican leadership in the 2008 race by calling the Iraq War a major mistake. In the 2016 primary debates, Trump went after the man whose brother was responsible for that blunder.\n\n\u201cThe way he took down Jeb Bush in the South Carolina debate was the greatest ever,\u201d said Doherty.\n\nAfter that debate, most of the GOP establishment pols and pundits predicted Trump\u2019s anti-war tirades would cost him the nomination.\n\nThe voting public had other ideas. But the inside-the-Beltway establishment still backs the foreign policy that calls for the U.S. to sort out the turf wars of the Mideast.\n\n\u201cThe people who oppose Trump are the same people who really want to attack Iran,\u201d said Doherty. \u201cThey\u2019re really upset because that\u2019s their long-term plan and this is a step in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not mere speculation. The man Trump recently dismissed as his National Security Advisor, John Bolton, spent his time in office trying to get the president who campaigned against \u201cregime change\u201d to push for regime change in Iran.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t mind sending harsh rhetoric Tehran\u2019s way. But with this move, he shows once again he\u2019s serious about getting us out of the region.\n\nI discussed this with another former Army officer, one who watches over Washington from his home in Virginia just outside of the Beltway.\n\nPat Lang said that we have been at war so long that it seems like a natural state of affairs to the career officers. (Check his blog for the most realistic military analysis of the Mideast you will ever see.)\n\n\u201cThe generals we have now have never known peace during their careers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they cannot imagine being in the Army if there\u2019s not a war going on.\u201d\n\nAfter serving as a Green Beret in Vietnam, Lang spent most of his career in the peacetime Army. He learned Arabic and spent a couple decades doing intelligence work in places like Iraq and Yemen.\n\nMany pols and pundits are upset that Trump is not ordering military action to protect the Kurds from the Turkish incursion into the part of northeastern Syria that they control. Lang has a harshly realistic view:\n\n\u201cThe United States has a long, long record of abandoning allies,\u201d Lang said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it in a lot of places, the worst of which was Vietnam.\u201d\n\nIn this case, he said, the Turks are not likely to go very far beyond a buffer zone they have said they want to set up along their border with Syria.\n\nAs for sorting out the mess we\u2019ve made in Syria, Trump was wise not to take on that task. He issued another tweet last week that explained his reasoning.\n\n\u201cShould have never been there in the first place!\u201d\n\nNo, we shouldn\u2019t have.\n\nThe establishment may not be upset about the 18 years of war we\u2019ve had since 9/11.\n\nBut I suspect the voters have a different view.", "description": "", "authors": ["Paul Mulshine", "Pmulshine Starledger.Com", "Star-Ledger"], "top_image": "https://www.nj.com/resizer/_xz4d6GFCqJPuy5eBlyeRRG_hWA=/1280x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RLZUCEX55RHMHFXQ5UUWEUPS7M.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
