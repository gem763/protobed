Some use different versions of a pay-as-you-go system, where current workers pay for the benefits of current retirees \u2014 just as is done in the United States \u2014 while others have regulations that place most of the onus on either employers or employees.\n\nOne out of 11 people around the world are 65 or older in 2019, but by 2050, that figure will jump to one out of every six people \u2014 or 1.6 billion, according to the United Nations. Keeping their retirement secure and comfortable is a concern for everyone, including family members who may otherwise end up supporting their elderly loved ones and governments that would need to allocate more of their funds toward social insurance programs.\n\nTo ensure a comfortable retirement, Australian workers are in charge of contributing enough for their futures \u2014 and they do so through a nationwide mandatory defined contribution plan, which would provide income on top of a basic old age pension scheme. Australia also uses investment portfolios, but employers are responsible for contributing most of the assets, and employees are told their contributions are voluntary. The Australian version of Social Security is restrictive, and benefits are reduced or nonexistent for people over a certain income or asset limit. The U.K., on the other hand, mandates employers automatically enroll their workers in a defined contribution plan.\n\nChina is upfront that their old age pension system is faltering, and the country\u2019s one-child policy from the 1980s (now defunct, and replaced by a two-child policy) is partly to blame. There aren\u2019t enough workers to support the number of elderly retirees. Japan also has far fewer young workers to support older citizens, and suffers from one of the highest old-age dependency ratios in the world. The government has begun introducing defined contribution plans, similar to a 401(k), which some Japanese workers are gladly using to mitigate the risk of receiving no old age pension down the line.\n\nSome countries are in the midst of reform. Brazil is currently implementing a retirement age, because its pension has been too flexible and generous for retirees, and the country is experiencing rapid aging \u2014 thus, making the system unsustainable and dangerous to the country\u2019s economy. Sweden is also changing its retirement age, and increasing the age in which companies can force employees to retire. This Nordic country, however, already experienced significant changes to its pension system in the 1990s, including a portion of employer and employee contributions going toward a private individual investment account for workers.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the United States\u2019 Social Security system. The program is beloved, but it is also in need of attention. If nothing is changed, the two trust funds that support Social Security are at risk of running out of money by 2035, in which case retirees would receive 80% of the benefits they\u2019re owed. But millions of Americans rely on Social Security for most, if not all, of their retirement income. Politicians, including presidential candidates for 2020, aren\u2019t talking too much about solutions to this problem, though legislators have considered raising the full retirement age and increasing taxes to help fund it in the past.\n\nMarketWatch broke down the pension systems of countries across the globe:\n\n\u2022 China:How China\u2019s one-child policy helped to endanger its retirees\n\n\u2022 Japan:Retiring in Japan: Seniors greatly outnumber younger workers \u2014 and that\u2019s a big problem for everyone\n\n\u2022 Brazil:Brazil wants to make it harder to become a retiree\n\n\u2022 Australia:Australia\u2019s safety net for retirees is generous and comprehensive \u2014 and complicated\n\n\u2022 Sweden:Sweden partially privatized its Social Security \u2014 here\u2019s how it has worked out\n\n\u2022 The United Kingdom:U.K. companies are required to enroll workers in retirement plans \u2014 and it\u2019s helping them save more\n\n\u2022 The United States:Social Security is a lifeline for many older Americans, but how will it be funded in the future?", "description": "Caring for retirees is a problem all over the world \u2014 here are some solutions", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ775_SS_int_ZG_20190905152157.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
