Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) deleted the year-old tweet announcing her DNA test results, it was discovered on Wednesday.\n\nWarren \u2013 who claimed to possess Native American heritage, Cherokee, specifically, over the course of her academic career \u2013 deleted the infamous tweet announcing the results of her DNA test after PJ Media columnist Jim Treacher wrote a post titled, \u201cHappy Anniversary to Elizabeth Warren\u2019s DNA Test!\u201d on Tuesday:\n\nMy family (including Fox News-watchers) sat together and talked about what they think of @realDonaldTrump\u2019s attacks on our heritage. And yes, a famous geneticist analyzed my DNA and concluded that it contains Native American ancestry. pic.twitter.com/r3SNzP22f8 \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 15, 2018\n\nThey also made the video private on YouTube. https://t.co/kPeOfE1Nv3 \u2014 Huell Babineaux did nothing wrong (@jtLOL) October 16, 2019\n\nThe entire \"Heritage\" section of @ewarren's campaign site is gone. pic.twitter.com/Rh2bqLwfOt \u2014 Huell Babineaux did nothing wrong (@jtLOL) October 16, 2019\n\n\ud83d\udea8BREAKING \ud83d\udea8 Sen. Warren just deleted the last remaining evidence of her humiliating DNA video from the internet. In the video Warren brags about her 1/1024th Native DNA. Embarrassing Eventually, she apologized & deleted. Luckily I saved the video\n\nSHARE SO IT LIVES FOREVER: pic.twitter.com/jeHQPynzic \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 16, 2019\n\nThe DNA results did not bode well for Warren, despite her initial victory lap. The results showed that she possessed between 1/64th and 1/1024th Native American ancestry, or between 0.1 percent to 1.56 percent. Additionally, the results indicated that Warren\u2019s minuscule Native American links were not associated with tribes in the United States, further casting doubt on her claims of Cherokee heritage.\n\nPresident Trump pounced on the results.\n\n\u201cPocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed,\u201d he wrote on October 16, 2018.\n\n\u201cShe took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average American. Now Cherokee Nation denies her, \u2018DNA test is useless.\u2019 Even they don\u2019t want her. Phony!\u201d he added:\n\nPocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed.

Phony! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2018\n\n\u201cA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship,\u201d Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr. said. \u201cCurrent DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person\u2019s ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\u201d:\n\nUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong. It makes a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, whose ancestors are well documented and whose heritage is prove. Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.\n\nThe results followed Warren\u2019s years of false Native American claims. She listed herself as a minority professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Harvard Law School and claimed Native American heritage on her Texas Bar registration card.\n\nShe continued to tout false claims of Native American heritage into her 2012 senatorial bid, telling a reporter that she had pictures that reflected her Native American heritage but added, \u201cI have plenty of pictures. They\u2019re not for you,\u201d leaving the purported evidence shrouded in mystery:\n\nThat same year, Warren told the story of her parents, claiming that her father\u2019s parent\u2019s disapproved of her mother because she \u2013 as Warren claimed \u2013 was part Cherokee and Delaware.\n\n\u201cIf your family heritage had an African American like you have, the grandfather or great grandparent who was a Cherokee, would you call yourself a black, and expect African Americans to accept that?\u201d New England Cable News\u2019s Jim Braude asked Warren.\n\n\u201cIf that same ancestor was black and not Cherokee,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf my Father\u2019s parents had said, \u2018You can\u2019t marry her because she\u2019s black, and that had been part of our family growing up, that we had two different families?\u201d Warren said.\n\n\u201cYou would be comfortable with saying you\u2019re black?\u201d Braude asked.\n\n\u201cIt would be part of identification,\u201d Warren quipped:\n\nElizabeth Warren says her parents had to elope because she was part Cherokee and part Delaware. This entire situation is worse than I had thought. pic.twitter.com/E87HDB3Qqo \u2014 \ud83c\udf39 (@AlytaDeLeon) September 28, 2019\n\nWhile Warren has failed to offer an explicit and thorough explanation for her years of misleading claims, she has vaguely apologized for making a \u201cmistake\u201d and admitted that she is \u201cnot a person of color\u201d and \u201cnot a citizen of a tribe.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike anyone who\u2019s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,\u201d Warren said at the Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, in August. \u201cI am sorry for harm I have caused\u201d:\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign deleted the results of her DNA test from her campaign website in August.", "description": "Sen.
