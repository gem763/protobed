I know there was a clear imbalance of power in this woman\u2019s relationship with Matt.\u201d\n\nEX-NBC NEWS ANCHOR MATT LAUER REPORTEDLY EXPOSED HIMSELF TO 'TODAY' PRODUCER\n\nIn his new book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d Ronan Farrow also claims Lauer repeatedly harassed a fellow on-air NBC personality, who was allegedly forced to sign a strict NDA when she left the network in 2012. It\u2019s not clear if it\u2019s the same woman we\u2019ve learned about.\n\nFarrow reports that the unnamed former NBC broadcaster claimed Lauer and another NBC exec propositioned her and made lewd comments about her during broadcasts. She said, \u201cI was like meat on a hook \u2026 I would walk into work with a knot in my stomach. I would come home and cry.\u201d\n\nShe alleged that when she turned the men down, she was \u201cpunished\u201d and got fewer assignments, adding: \u201cMy career took a sharp nosedive.\u201d Although she didn\u2019t make a formal report to HR, she did tell colleagues. When she left, NBC forced her to sign a nondisclosure agreement that waived her right to sue and banned her from making disparaging comments about the network, the book states.\n\nRONAN FARROW RECALLS MATT LAUER'S RESPONSE AFTER TELLING NBC ANCHOR HE WAS WORKING ON 'SEXUAL HARASSMENT' STORY\n\nLauer has strenuously denied any wrongdoing. His lawyers had no comment. Despite Farrow\u2019s reporting, NBC stated that Brooke Nevils\u2019 allegation of rape against Lauer, made in 2017, was the first time execs had heard of any wrongdoing.\n\nNBC News president Noah Oppenheim said in a staff memo Monday that no records had been found of inappropriate messages from Lauer to the woman Farrow mentioned, and said she signed a standard NDA.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the New York Post.", "description": "Disgraced \u201cToday\u201d anchor\u00a0Matt Lauer\u00a0allegedly had an affair with a famed and well-respected broadcaster, the New York Post is exclusively told, representing a \u201cclear imbalance of power.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/09/694940094001_6093447658001_6093453226001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
