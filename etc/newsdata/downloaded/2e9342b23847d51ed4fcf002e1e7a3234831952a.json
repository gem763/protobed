Their presence in the chamber reportedly erupted into yelling matches with committee members.\n\n\u201cThank you to House Republicans for being tough, smart, and understanding in detail the greatest Witch Hunt in American History. It has been going on since long before I even got Elected (the Insurance Policy!). A total Scam!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nMany Senate Republicans are taking a wait-and-see approach amid the House impeachment inquiry. Rather than commenting on the substance of the inquiry, they are united in complaining that the House is taking depositions from witnesses behind closed doors.\n\nThe escalation by Republicans comes after Bill Taylor, the most senior US diplomat in Kyiv, testified for hours before House investigators on Tuesday, delivering an account that was so shocking to some lawmakers that freshman Democrat Andy Levin described it as \u201cmy most disturbing day in Congress so far\u201d.\n\nIn a lengthy opening statement, Taylor said Trump wanted \u201ceverything\u201d, including military aid to Ukraine, tied to a commitment by Ukrainian leaders to investigate Democrats and the 2016 election plus a company linked to the family of Trump\u2019s leading 2020 Democratic rival, Joe Biden.\n\nTaylor said Trump \u201cwanted President Zelenskiy \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations\u201d.\n\nRepublicans have largely sought to attack the inquiry on procedural grounds, objecting to the private nature of the hearings and demanding access to the full breadth of the testimony that has rattled Washington in recent weeks.\n\nMuch of the testimony that has been made public, however, and news reports confirm key elements of a whistleblower complaint that set in motion the impeachment inquiry. The investigation centers on reports of Trump withholding military aid and dangling a meeting at the White House for Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in return for favors that would benefit him in domestic US politics.", "description": "Senator says Mitch McConnell is a co-sponsor of the resolution as evidence against the president continues to mount", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e371b9647127f87d46a002a9c2fb440e3fa4985/0_123_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c0e069fd2d8551bfb357e5c99ffbb77", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
