Superfast Computers and the Race for Domination", "language": "en", "text": "This was not just any math problem.\n\nOn Wednesday, Google said its researchers had performed a calculation that the largest supercomputers could not complete in under 10,000 years. And they had done it in 3 minutes 20 seconds.\n\nWith that calculation, the company said, its research lab in Santa Barbara, Calif., achieved a milestone that scientists had been working toward since the 1980s \u2014 a breakthrough called \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d that could allow new kinds of computers to do calculations at speeds that are inconceivable with today\u2019s technology.\n\nThe long-sought breakthrough could have implications for national security and cryptography and even pave the way for the creation of new medicines. Here\u2019s what you need to know about quantum computing and the importance of Google\u2019s claim.\n\nChina and the U.S. see it as a matter of national security\n\nLike all leaps in technology, quantum machines are a double-edged sword: Someday, they could power advances in artificial intelligence. But they could also overwhelm the encryption that protects computers vital to national security or even the e-commerce sites we all use everyday.", "description": "Quantum computing is a national security priority, and a big focus of competition in the technology industry.", "authors": ["David Yaffe-Bellany"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/business/23quantumexplained/merlin_163164954_684c5e4b-8330-42bf-bb81-b1cb048a7bd8-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
