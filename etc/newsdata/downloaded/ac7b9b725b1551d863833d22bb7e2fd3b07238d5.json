The target federal funds rate is now in a range of 2% to 2.25%.\n\nBut three members dissented. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard called for a 50 basis point cut while Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George pushed for no change at all.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's President and CEO Eric S.

Seven of the 17 participants on the committee saw another 25 basis point cut by the new year, but five participants feel the appropriate level by year-end would in the range of 2% to 2.25% (the level prior to Wednesday\u2019s cut).\n\nSeven of the 17 participants on the FOMC projects one more rate cut by the end of the year.

George opposed the Fed\u2019s continuation of $85-billion-a-month asset purchases while Bullard pushed for a more aggressively accommodative tone.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell (R) speaks with New York Fed President John Williams and Kansas City Fed President Esther George (L) at the Kansas City Fed\u2019s annual Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, U.S. August 24, 2018.

Although the Fed committed to data-dependence in the beginning of the year, the central bank has now turned to \u201cinsurance\u201d cuts to hedge against the uncertainty of trade concerns and geopolitical risk. In Jackson Hole in August, Powell said the biggest problem is that there have been \u201cno recent precedents\u201d for the Fed to model trade risk in particular.", "description": "Fed Chairman Jerome Powell faces the tough task of corralling a committee dividing further on where rates should go next.", "authors": ["Brian Cheung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IGnpU5LaxfavtsAtuyzcKQ--~B/aD0yNDU2O3c9MzY5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/6815f9d0-da6a-11e9-bf96-a69e5d92defe", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
