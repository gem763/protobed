Entertainment Inc./IMDb)\n\nWithout Zack Snyder, DC Comics peddles only madness and suffering.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix\u2019s performance in Joker might have been impressive had he not devoted his career to playing so many weirdos. In Joker, produced by Bradley Cooper and directed by Todd Phillips (Cooper\u2019s enabler on the snarky, gross-out Hangover flicks), yet another DC Comics origin story, the clown-face villain, is used as an acting showcase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is an overly self-conscious remake, like Cooper\u2019s A Star Is Born, and is similarly self-serious and humorless. Phoenix and friends, still working from the malign charisma of Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker in The Dark Knight, evoke Christopher Nolan\u2019s nihilism for maudlin irony.\n\nArthur Fleck (Phoenix) works at Ha-Ha\u2019s, an agency employing destitute men as party clowns. He\u2019s introduced crying as he applies Pagliacci makeup in a mirror. But that isn\u2019t ironic enough; he really wants to be a stand-up comic. More irony: He suffers from pseudobulbar affect, the condition causing sudden, inappropriate laughter.\n\nThis handy diagnosis actually conveys the larger cultural problem of Nolan\u2019s DC Comics reboot. Generations raised on Nolan\u2019s \u201csmartness\u201d have lost the proper affect about issues of alienation, violence, and morality. Nolan\u2019s premise that everything is dark and ironic leads him to embrace dystopia, the symbolic hellhole that is Gotham City. Phillips gives us Blade Runner without beauty \u2014 a pseudo-artistic response that inappropriately normalizes Millennial dysfunction.\n\nFleck\u2019s disaffection is a given, and Phoenix takes it as far as he can. Having done this sociopathic-reprobate act so many times (most recently in Lynne Ramsay\u2019s anomic Taxi Driver rip-off You Were Never Really Here), he\u2019s made it his stock-in-trade. Phoenix\u2019s effeminate, degenerate, mental defective is sometimes deranged-handsome like Daniel Day Lewis or Morrissey morphing into Andy Kaufman. Worst irony of all: Fleck is a mime. After a street mugging, even his lapel boutonni\u00e8re bleeds. He gets a gun and becomes a homicidal mime, a berserk vigilante \u2014 performing ballet in a dilapidated subway men\u2019s room \u2014 who triggers anxiety in the populace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoenix\u2019s precisely measured dementia exploits the cultural condition that comic-book movie culture has already degenerated, especially now that Zack Snyder\u2019s DC Comics vision has been officially \u2014 foolishly \u2014 discredited by Hollywood executives and Internet trolls. Phoenix and Phillips project our contemporary social disorder onto DC Comics. The clown figure classically evokes German expressionism, but Flex internalizes expressionist fear and revulsion \u2014 merely as a formulaic, commercial style. Flashbacks (about his past and his mother\u2019s commitment in Arkham Asylum) show his imaginings as real: He\u2019s always inside them, which is either a cheat or inept.\n\nPhoenix savors Fleck\u2019s anxiety (prancing down a staircase to Gary Glitter\u2019s \u201cRock and Roll, Part One\u201d in triumph and madness), but the film\u2019s irony overload leaves his mental and physical contortions inexpressive. (He takes up insanity where Nicolas Cage left off, but Cage had better luck with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and Mom and Dad.) Fleck\u2019s obsession with TV host Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro) detours into meta territory (1982\u2019s The King of Comedy, Scorsese\u2019s own ironic dystopian vision), which is merely another actor\u2019s fetish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Prince posed as Joker in his 1989 Partyman music video that accompanied Tim Burton\u2019s first Batman movie, his showbiz mania satirized the entire Warners-Batman enterprise \u2014 biting the hand that fed him. Since then, Nolan has created an audience that seems indebted to Hollywood hegemony, inspiring filmmakers such as Phoenix and Phillips who are incapable of analyzing their own motivations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoenix and Phillips turn Joker into a sociopolitical mishmash. Clown-masked protesters (chanting Kill the Rich, Resist, We Are All Clowns) at first suggest political satire, but Phillips\u2019s position is unclear: Are these Antifa clones sympathetic? Is Fleck\u2019s madness a metaphor for political dementia? Do the marauding street thugs represent MS-13? Are the trio of white male subway louts who attack Fleck fantasies of white-supremacist privilege? De Niro\u2019s cameo doesn\u2019t fully account for his own recent series of public breakdowns, just as the Trump-like figure of Bruce Wayne\u2019s father exists in a gray area of Hollywood indecision and conflicted imperatives. (Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was executive producer on Batman v Superman.) It becomes clear that Fleck\u2019s neurological condition is not congenital, just an affectation \u2014 neurosis turned into urban psychosis.\n\nWhen Fleck tells detectives searching for the vigilante, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in anything,\u201d it is the ultimate homage to Nolan\u2019s nihilism. In the final shot, Fleck becomes Joker, the king of anarchy, and pulls a bloody smile before the rioting street mob. This deliberately contrasts Batman v Superman\u2019s Day of the Dead scene, reversing the mythic, moral foundation that Zack Snyder\u2019s masterpiece provided. Only suffering and madness remain. Trump Derangement Syndrome takes over now that Snyder is gone. Joker could have been the Trump Derangement Syndrome movie to end them all, but TDS has become a franchise.", "description": "Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s performance in 'Joker' might have been impressive had he not devoted his career to playing so many weirdoes.", "authors": ["Armond White", "Andrew C.
