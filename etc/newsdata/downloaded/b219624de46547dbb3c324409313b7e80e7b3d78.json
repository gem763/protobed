But with massive, massive surprises that even had me like, \"Oh, wow!\" So I think we\u2019re going to really shock people.\n\n'I would say that he\u2019s reconnected with his heart. We\u2019re de\ufb01nitely seeing a Bond who\u2019s more in touch with his feelings and more open to falling in love.'\n\nThe film brings to an end a five-year wait for more Bond, during which Craig's future involvement in the franchise remained unresolved.\n\nWelcome back: New film No Time To Die brings to an end a five-year wait for more Bond, during which Craig's future involvement in the franchise remained unresolved\n\nAnd Naomie acknowledges that groundbreaking social changes have in turn demanded changes from the hugely popular film series, starting with its portrayal of women.\n\n'At the end of Spectre there are women he gives his career up for: there\u2019s no more emotional attachment than that,' she said.\n\n'It\u2019s just about moving with the times and recognising that women can no longer be seen as eye candy.'\n\nPreviously: Harris, 43, admits the traditionally masculine Bond will be a vastly different character to the one we last saw driving into the sunset with co-star L\u00e9a Seydoux in Spectre\n\nNaomie made her first appearance as Moneypenny in 2012 smash Skyfall, arguably Craig's greatest critical and commercial achievement as Bond.\n\nTraditionally a faithful MI6 secretary whose flirty repartee with Bond provided rare moments of light relief, she was reintroduced to the franchise as a ballsy field officer before making the transition to M's right hand woman.\n\nBut while the role has introduced Naomie to a broader audience, she says it was a later role in Oscar-winning drama Moonlight that completely transformed her career.\n\nSuccess: While Moneypenny has introduced Naomie to a broader audience, she says it was a later role as a crack addicted mother in Oscar-winning drama Moonlight that completely transformed her career\n\nLooking back at the 2016 coming of age drama, the actress admits her role as crack addicted Paula helped pave the way for a variety of challenging roles, among them her latest in soon to be released police procedural Black and Blue.\n\n'I expected [Moonlight] to make a difference but not on the level it has,' she explained. 'It\u2019s completely changed my career. It\u2019s changed how many offers I\u2019ve got, the fee I can command, my standing in the industry, the respect I get given.\n\n'It\u2019s huge. I wouldn\u2019t have been offered something of the exposure of Black And Blue before Moonlight.'\n\nSee the full interview available online now via GQ HYPE.", "description": "The actress will return as Eve Moneypenny in No Time To Die, her third consecutive appearance as the iconic character in what will be Daniel Craig's fifth and final outing as Bond.", "authors": ["Jason Chester For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/11/19390108-0-image-a-48_1570443508564.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
