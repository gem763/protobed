The order came on September 2 over what the Bangladeshi government is describing as \u201csecurity grounds\u201d. According to reports, the affected telecommunications operators have seven days to submit reports to the government on the measures they have taken to shut down all network services to the camps.\n\nEven though Bangladesh had officially banned mobile phones back in September 2017\u2014within a month of the Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar\u2019s military crackdown\u2014the decree was never fully enforced.\n\nThe authorities claim that the move is \u201cpositive\u201d, and that it will help curb crime and violence. Ikbal Hossain, a police spokesman in Cox\u2019s Bazar, told the AFP that refugees have been \u201cabusing\u201d mobile phone services to smuggle of methamphetamine pills, or yaba, as they\u2019re colloquially known. \"It will definitely make a positive impact. I believe criminal activities will surely come down,\" claimed the police spokesman.\n\nPolice authorities have also claimed to have dealt with cases of murder, robbery, gang war and family feuds within the camp. Ever since the exodus two years ago, Bangladeshi security forces have reportedly have shot at least 34 Rohingya refugees, mostly for yaba trafficking. However, human rights reports say these are extrajudicial killings by the Bangladeshi forces in the name of anti-drug operations.\n\nMany say, however, that the communication ban has nothing to do with fighting crime. Even though there\u2019s been no official reaction to the shutdown, the ban is being seen as one that will separate refugees from their families who\u2019re still in Myanmar. A UN official told Al Jazeera, on conditions of anonymity, that the move will \u201cfurther isolate and victimise the already persecuted people.\u201d \"Seeking to limit their communication amongst themselves, with Bangladeshis and people abroad, will serve to push them towards negative coping habits be it crime, violence or extremism,\" he said.\n\nFollow Pallavi Pundir on Twitter.", "description": "The authorities say the refugees have been \u201cabusing\u201d phone services to traffic meth.
