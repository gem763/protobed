PATRICK MARMION reviews An Enemy Of The People", "language": "en", "text": "An Enemy Of The People (Nottingham Playhouse)\n\nVerdict: Alex Kingston underused\n\nRating:\n\nThe King Of Hell\u2019s Palace (Hampstead Theatre, London)\n\nVerdict: Shocking story, rambling plot\n\nRating:\n\nOne great advantage of basing a play on a classic is you get a head start. Another is you can pull in great actors like Alex Kingston \u2014 as Nottingham Playhouse has done for Rebecca Lenkiewicz\u2019s new version of Henrik Ibsen\u2019s 19th-century protest drama re-set in modern Norway.\n\nAll therefore seems set fair, with blue jeans and IKEA furniture added to Ibsen\u2019s North Atlantic perma-drizzle.\n\nIt starts off feeling good and familiar, too, with Kingston as a doctor in a spa town where her obedient house-husband (Deka Walmsley) and children appear to be well trained.\n\nShe, moreover, is confident that her discovery of pollution in the town\u2019s popular spa waters will be dealt with, so she can continue her cosy, middle-class dream life of bracing walks, mojito cocktails and hash pipes.\n\nAt bay: Alex Kingston and Deka Walmsley in An Enemy Of The People\n\nUnfortunately, her brother has other ideas. Played by Malcolm Sinclair, he is the town mayor and a dry old stick, with the niggardly manner of a vengeful chartered accountant.\n\nHe sees that the tourist trade will not be well served by the scandal of her discovery, and arranges for the support she enjoys from the local paper and a popular shop steward to turn against her.\n\nAfter the interval it\u2019s as though Lenkiewicz loses interest . . . and with it, the plot. Kingston\u2019s reasonable doctor becomes a rambling supremacist, furious with locals who fail to salute her selfless integrity.\n\nThe people evolve into a swivel-eyed lynch mob as the wheels come off an already sketchy and polemical play. Some of this may sound painfully reminiscent of our own woes with Remainers and Brexiteers \u2014 and lo and behold, that\u2019s the idea!\n\nOaths fly in all directions, as if Fiona Bruce had lost control of Question Time. And in a desperate bid to rescue a message, director Adam Penford has Kingston stand alone at the end playing the trump card of her victimhood as she proclaims: \u2018The strongest woman, she\u2019s always alone.\u2019\n\nThe King Of Hell\u2019s Palace is also a quasi-version of Ibsen\u2019s conspiracy drama \u2014 only this time, it\u2019s a blood supply contaminated with HIV in rural China of the 1990s\n\nKingston is a terrific talent, and is not well employed spouting such saccharine sentiment. The consequence is that Sinclair\u2019s villainous brother becomes the play\u2019s best character, and even wins pantomime boos at the end \u2014 which he takes with a grin.\n\nNot really what Ibsen intended and nor, I suspect, Ms Lenkiewicz.\n\nThe King Of Hell\u2019s Palace is also a quasi-version of Ibsen\u2019s conspiracy drama \u2014 only this time, it\u2019s a blood supply contaminated with HIV in rural China of the 1990s.\n\nBased on the testimony of exiled whistleblower Dr Shuping Wang, it\u2019s a fascinating insight into Chinese society.\n\nThis could make a terrific thriller, but writer Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig is torn between the chavvy excesses of Chinese peasants selling their blood, the self-serving ambition of officials lining their pockets and the lofty conscience of another doctor disappointed by everyone\u2019s attitude.\n\nBased on the testimony of exiled whistleblower Dr Shuping Wang, it\u2019s a fascinating insight into Chinese society\n\nThe upshot is a rambling account of the Aids epidemic that ravaged China\u2019s Zhoukou region of Henan.\n\nYa-Chu Cowhig commits the cardinal sin of letting the truth get in the way of a good story, getting bogged down in explanatory dialogue, cardboard characters and a meandering plot.\n\nNor does Tom Piper\u2019s design bring clarity, with the multi-location action set in a brick farmyard inexplicably served by a two-lane conveyor-belt reaching into the audience.\n\nDirected by former RSC boss Michael Boyd, the show boasts just one complex character: Celeste Den as the doctor torn between her family and her conscience.\n\nMore excitement is created by Millicent Wong as the sensationally amoral peasant who goes from unqualified nurse, to unscrupulous businesswoman and cut-throat politician.\n\nNow there\u2019s a story worth telling.\n\nHot lunches and cold comfort for this community in crisis ...\n\nFaith, Hope And Charity (National Theatre, Dorfman)\n\nVerdict: Gentle austerity play\n\nRating:\n\nThe setting for Alexander Zeldin\u2019s new play is disarmingly charming: this smart London studio theatre roughed up into a crayon-scuffed, fluorescent tube-lit community centre.\n\nSheltering from the drizzle, and life, is a disparate group of the lonely, the troubled, lost and needy. All have the sleepy faces and watery eyes of actual humans; the theatrical sheen impressively stripped back.\n\nFaith, Hope And Charity is touching, ferociously well played . . . and incredibly slow. That naturalistic dialogue which is effortlessly witty (jokes about cutting sandwiches into triangles) saves many moments. But even so, I almost broke my watch checking it.\n\nCecilia Noble again proving to be the most warmly engaging actor on the London stage\n\nHazel, a round mumsy matriarch, volunteers here (Cecilia Noble again proving to be the most warmly engaging actor on the London stage). She dishes up hot lunches, with a side of ad-hoc counselling.\n\nThe tender, snappily efficient way in which she deals with the confused elderly, the desperate mums, a young man with learning difficulties is gorgeous. Slowly these people\u2019s lives, including hers, are revealed.\n\nMason, her new volunteer help, is played by Nick Holder as a fantastically awkward Wolverhampton worrier.\n\nThe thread running right through is cuts. The roof, quite literally, was not fixed when the sun was shining, and now the drip drip drip of water and the threat of closure are looming.\n\nTherapy isn\u2019t available, many of those we meet are stuck in hostels \u2014 and don\u2019t get them started on the courts. But it\u2019s not an unadulterated moan at the system. These are complicated people.\n\nSixteen-year-old Marc (a heartbreakingly brilliant Bobby Stallwood), dealing with his useless mother, is a particularly tricky watch.\n\nSeeing him shake with rage while being encouraged to join in the community centre\u2019s choir is a treat; scarily natural and red-blooded.\n\nTheir story \u2014 how his young sister was taken into care and how they\u2019re fighting for her \u2014 is the backbone of the night.\n\nThe issue is that even this, the meatiest of the tales, doesn\u2019t quite sustain my attention.\n\nThe play\u2019s charm is in its seemingly aimless wander through these people\u2019s lives. But sometimes it really does get lost in a thicket.\n\nLUKE JONES\n\nMove over, James Corden \u2013 make room for David O\u2019Reilly!\n\nOne Man, Two Guvnors (Derby Theatre and then Queen\u2019s Theatre Hornchurch)\n\nVerdict: Feelgood fun\n\nRating:\n\nOne man, Two Guvnors is a play that\u2019s forever defined by its first production by Nick Hytner at the National Theatre, with James Corden as the underdog Francis Henshall.\n\nFortunately, I am the only person I know who missed it. Which means I could enjoy David O Reilly\u2019s take on the glutton who takes on two bosses in order to maximise his chances of a good feed, without forever comparing him with Corden.\n\nUnfortunately for Francis, who is as lazy and libidinous as he is greedy, both his employers are staying at the Cricketer\u2019s Arms in Brighton \u2014 nicely evoked in the interiors of Neil Irish\u2019s set.\n\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s so good, he makes the scripted impromptu exchanges with members of the audience seem wholly spontaneous. In fact, I think one exchange may even have been real.\n\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s so good, he makes the scripted impromptu exchanges with members of the audience seem wholly spontaneous.\n\nIt\u2019s a farce, and so it\u2019s a romp, based on the traditions of the commedia del\u2019arte and the 1746 original play by Carlo Goldoni, which writer Richard Bean has enormous fun with.\n\nSarah Brigham\u2019s production is set in 1963, so we\u2019ve still got menus in French, virgin brides and Cockney crime lords who forge the ties that bind them at Parkhurst Prison. David Cardy, as Charlie \u2018the Duck\u2019 Clench, effortlessly inhabits the role.\n\nIt\u2019s all played with knowing nostalgia: when Francis\u2019s love interest, Dolly \u2014 played smartly by Rosie Strobel \u2014 predicts a time, 20 years hence, when a woman will be PM, she says this will show the compassionate side of women in power. Ha ha.\n\nThe Derby audience responded warmly to the gags (including the dig that the local nursing homes had been emptied for the show), and also the antics of Alfie the waiter, played by TJ Holmes, whose falls downstairs have all the predictability of the clowns in a circus act.\n\nThere\u2019s the slapstick element, the spirited Rozzers Skiffle Band and cod intellectual stuff, like Francis pondering aloud about where the conventions of commedia del\u2019arte will take him in the second act \u2014 from food to philandering, that\u2019s where.\n\nIt\u2019s a warm, good hearted production. And sometimes that\u2019s what you need.\n\nMELANIE McDONAGH", "description": "PATRICK MARMION: One great advantage of basing a play on a classic is you get a head start.
