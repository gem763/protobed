Wilson\u2019s non-profit group is now accepting pre-orders for the $1,200 Ghost Gunner, a small, computer-numerically-controlled (CNC) milling machine. The Ghost Gunner can carve the lower receiver of the AR-15 from a piece of aluminum based on a digital model uploaded to a computer that connects to the machine. A key component of a rifle, the lower receiver is the body of the gun and connects to all the other parts, including the stock, barrel and magazine. Under U.S. firearms laws, the lower receiver is the one gun component that is considered a firearm and, thus, also the most regulated part. The Ghost Gunner requires the user to furnish his own pre-made lower receiver, a piece of metal already shaped like a lower receiver but lacks the holes and cavities to make it into the proper body of a working gun. The pre-made receivers are sometimes called \u201c80 percent lowers\u201d and can cost the user somewhere between $80 to $100 apiece. With an unfinished lower \u2014 which Wilson says is not considered a firearm \u2014 an upper receiver, a parts kit and a magazine, all of which can be purchased anonymously online, users can build a gun in an hour. \u201cWe\u2019re making this easier by an order of magnitude,\u201d says Wilson. \u2026 The milling machine\u2019s name is clearly a jab at California State Senator Kevin de Leon, whose proposal to outlaw the creation of homemade guns with no serial numbers, which he calls \u201cghost guns,\u201d was vetoed by anti-gun Governor Jerry Brown. In a press conference earlier this year, de Leon said making gun-making tools more available endangers the general public as it makes it easier for \u201cdangerous individuals like criminals and the mentally unstable\u201d to obtain weapons for criminal purposes. \u201cThe threat is real,\u201d he says (video). \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to see an emerging industry and market for ghost guns. No one knows they exist until after a crime has been committed.\u201d\n\nThis is Wilson\u2019s \u201cGhost Gunner.\u201d\n\nThe information technology media seems to think that the \u201cGhost Gunner\u201d\u2014which costs roughly the same as two factory-finished AR-15s at today\u2019s prices\u2014is something new and magical. To be fair, it probably is new for a bunch of technology geeks who know next to nothing about firearms outside of what they\u2019ve seen playing Call of Duty.\n\nIt\u2019s almost much ado about nothing for those who have been building AR-15s lowers and parts kit AKMs using far less expensive home shop tools for decades.\n\nUsing nothing more than a $70-100 drill press or even a hand drill with jigs, people have been completing perfectly functional AR-15 lower receivers since at least the 1990s.\n\nLikewise, you can buy all the equipment necessary to build a small factory churning out AKMs (the correct name for AK-series rifles that the media continues to call AK-47s, even though the original Ak-47 series hasn\u2019t been made since 1960) from parts kits and receiver flats for less than $700.\n\nWilson\u2019s \u201cGhost Gunner\u201d CNC machine is far more expensive than either of these options. All you\u2019re really getting for that $1,200 is a bit of machinery that clearly announces your intentions to any government intent seriously intent on identifying the makers of personal firearms, a comforting level of \u201cplug and play\u201d capability, and a reduced margin of error in unskilled hands.\n\nIs the \u201cGhost Gunner\u201d worth it?\n\nIt depends on what your goals are.\n\nIf your goal is to make personal firearms without \u201cBig Brother\u201d knowing what you are doing, then no, it probably isn\u2019t worth the investment when less expensive tools with a much more versatility can be used to achieve similar results.\n\nIf your goal is to terrify and infuriate the agents of an ever-more-intrusive government, however, the Ghost Gunner serves its purpose well, and that is precisely the role of everything produced by Defense Distributed, which exists for the explicit purpose of ticking off all the right people.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bob Owens", "Author'S Bio", "Bob Owens Is The Editor Of", "Posted At Am On October"], "top_image": "https://bearingarms.com/wp-content/themes/Bearing-Arms-2016/images/ba_placeholder.png", "published_at": "2014-10-02"}
