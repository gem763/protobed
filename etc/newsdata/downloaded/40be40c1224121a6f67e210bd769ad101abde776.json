Jayson Tatum finished with 25 points and nine rebounds.\n\nWATCH | Celtics top Raptors in early-season tilt:\n\nPascal Siakam had a game-high 33 points while Kyle Lowry scored 29 but it wasn't enough to hold off a Celtics 4th quarter rally as Boston beats Toronto 112-106. 1:26\n\nWalker said support from his teammates helped him shake off a 0-for-5 start from the field just two days removed from his 4 for 18 performance in Boston's season-opening loss to Philadelphia.\n\n\"That's what I needed,\" Walker said. \"The things that they said to me are the things that I needed to hear. They seen my face, kind of down at times. They just kept encouraging me.\"\n\nThe Celtics shot only 38 per cent, but it wasn't for a lack of trying. They had 109 attempts in the game.\n\nPascal Siakam scored 33 points and had eight rebounds to lead the Raptors, who went 18 of 36 from the three-point line. Kyle Lowry finished with 29 points, including six three-pointers. But the pair also had nine turnovers between them.\n\nSiakam becoming centre of attention\n\nSiakam said teams are playing him differently through two games.\n\n\"There's more help, obviously,\" he said. \"Last year, I felt like I was always out there on the side just working. Now there's a little more intention.\"\n\nThere were 12 ties and 19 lead changes, with neither team holding more than a seven-point lead.\n\nBoston found its shot in the fourth quarter, outscoring Toronto 36-24.\n\nOne of the plays that got the Celtics going came with 5:43 to play. Brown corralled a Marc Gasol miss, took two dribbles and threaded a half-court bounce pass between three Raptors defenders to a cutting Gordon Hayward for a layup to give the Celtics a 99-98 lead.\n\n\"I have definitely been working on that side of my game, being a playmaker and making plays for others,\" Brown said. \"Hopefully there will be a lot more passes like that coming soon.\"\n\nLater, the Celtics were leading 107-106 when Brown hit a three-pointer with 2:49 to play.\n\nOG Anunoby was called for a charge on Walker with 1:26 left, which was challenged by the Raptors. But after a review, the call was upheld.\n\nBoston got a shot-clock violation on its next trip down the floor, but Lowry turned it over on Toronto's ensuing possession when his one-handed pass along the baseline sailed out of bounds with 45 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Celtics closed out the final 9:07 of regulation on a 30-17 run.\n\nComing off a 34-point game in Toronto's season-opening win over New Orleans on Tuesday, Siakam also started slow. He missed his first four shots and was scoreless in the first period before he got a finger roll to fall just before halftime.", "description": "Jaylen Brown had 25 points, including a key three-pointer in the closing minutes, to help the Boston Celtics hold off the Toronto Raptors 112-106 on Friday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5336684.1572053738!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/raptors-celtics-basketball.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
