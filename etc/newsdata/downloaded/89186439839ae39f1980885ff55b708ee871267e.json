Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren have each put forward proposals for wealth taxes, which they say will only apply to people with $32 million or more ($16 million for individuals) and $50 million, respectively, a relatively small group of taxpayers.\n\nBut experts aren\u2019t so sure that target \"small group\" of taxpayers will hold over time.\n\n\u201cThat was what they said about the AMT [Alternative Minimum Tax],\u201d Tim Speiss, co-leader of EisnerAmper's Personal Wealth Advisory Group, told FOX Business. \u201cIf you drop the [wealth tax threshold] down to a lower net worth base, forget it.\u201d\n\nThe AMT, which was enacted in 1969, was initially designed to target about 155 wealthy taxpayers who were entirely avoiding income taxes by claiming special deductions. It acts as an extra tax on some, on top of their regular income tax.\n\nHowever, since the measure was not indexed for inflation, the proportion of people who were required to pay ballooned over time.\n\nAccording to a congressional report, about 1 million people paid the AMT in 1999, while about 31 million did so in 2010 \u2013 which covered all but the very lowest income classes.\n\n\u201cThe government over time started to realize how much revenue they were getting,\u201d Speiss said. \u201cWhen you look at what happened here, it became much broader than where it began \u2026 instead of it being this add-on tax it really became broadened under the 1982 [tax] legislation and then that was really it.\u201d\n\nTax revenue from the AMT was about $122 million in 1970. By 2014 it had grown to $28.6 billion.\n\nIf provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2013 which increased the AMT\u2019s exemption and exemption phase out\u2013 aren\u2019t extended, AMT revenue would leap from $6.2 billion in 2025 to $62.1 billion in 2026, according to estimates from the Tax Policy Center.\n\nChris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute and editor of www.DownsizingGovernment.org, noted politicians would likely be faced with similar temptations after implementing a potential wealth tax.\n\n\u201cOnce enacted, initial taxes just on the very rich wouldn\u2019t raise much money, and the government would still have massive deficits with rising entitlement costs, so the liberal politicians would push to lower the wealth tax into the middle class,\u201d Edwards told FOX Business.\n\nFormer Louisiana Governor and 2016 Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal made a similar point during an interview with FOX Business this week, adding that average Americans have a right to be worried.\n\n\u201cThe problem with these plans is \u2026 it always starts out that way, you know the income tax was only going to be on the wealthy \u2013 these taxes only are going to be on wealthy people \u2013 and then before you know it, if you own a nice home, if you own your car, if you have some savings for retirement, before you know it these wealth taxes are going to catch you as well,\u201d Jindal told FOX Business\u2019 Neil Cavuto.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nEdwards also pointed out that wealth taxes enacted in countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have fairly low exemptions. In Switzerland, for example, the tax affected singles with net wealth slightly above 67,000 Euros (around $73,400) in 2017. When it still had the tax, Germany\u2019s exemption threshold was around $66,800.\n\nPerhaps that is why both Warren and Sanders have gone out of their way to hammer home the fact that their proposals would only affect the wealthiest Americans. Warren calls her plan the \u201cultra-millionaire tax,\u201d while Sanders named his the \u201ctax on extreme wealth.\u201d They both are hoping the measure would help reduce growing economic inequality, as more resources become concentrated in the hands of a few rich individuals.\n\nCritics, however, argue that there could be near-term repercussions for the economy. Rich Americans invest their wealth, creating jobs and income. That means a loss of innovation and opportunity if capital investment is discouraged. It also potentially means slower economic growth.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nIn addition to questions regarding its constitutionality, there are doubts over how the IRS would be able to administer the tax since it requires a determination of the value of things like art and business ownership stakes on a continual basis.", "description": "The tax aimed at wealthy Americans might eventually catch middle-class workers, experts say.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/07/0/0/retirement-planning.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
