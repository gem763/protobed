AAPL, -0.81% rose 0.4% in premarket trading Friday, as the new iPhone 11 becomes available in stores, with J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee saying strong pre-order interest suggests a \"robust\" iPhone revenue trend. The stock's gain puts Apple on track to reclaim a trillion-dollar market capitalization. Chatterjee said his research indicates higher interest in the \"lower-end\" iPhone 11 model that initially anticipated by Apple and the supply chain, but over the next 12 months, he expects shipments to be more skewed towards the \"mid-end\" model. Cascend Securities Chief Investment Strategist Eric Ross raised his stock price target to $270 from $260, saying pre-orders look better than expected, with initial indications suggesting the \"higher-priced\" iPhone 11 Pro is seeing volume pre-order demand. The stock has rallied 10.8% over the past three months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.19% has gained 1.3%.", "description": "Shares of Apple Inc. rose 0.4% in premarket trading Friday, as the new iPhone 11 becomes available in stores, with J.P.
