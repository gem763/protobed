Chung was suspended for showing support for Hong Kong protesters in an interview after Hearthstone\u2019s Grandmaster tournament. The incident led to widespread complaints from the gaming community, as well as within Blizzard itself.\n\nSimilar to Blitzchung\u2019s ban, the three college players didn\u2019t receive word about their ban until a couple of days after they held up the sign. The Verge has reached out to Blizzard for additional comment.\n\nTeam player Casey Chambers tweeted out an email from a member of the Hearthstone team at Blizzard, which stated that the entire team received the ban for violating the company\u2019s official rules. Chambers and his teammates specifically violated a section of the rules pertaining to sportsmanship, which states that players must refrain from performing any gesture that insults a group of people or could incite others to act in a way that is \u201cabusive, insulting, mocking, or disruptive.\u201d\n\nHappy to announce the AU Hearthstone team received a six month ban from competition. While delayed I appreciate all players being treated equally and no one being above the rules. pic.twitter.com/mZStoF0e0t \u2014 Casey Chambers (@Xcelsior_hs) October 16, 2019\n\nThe team\u2019s ban is just the latest entry in a global protest of Blizzard\u2019s actions. The level of discourse surrounding the incident prompted J. Allen Brack, Blizzard Entertainment president, to issue a lengthy response. The statement addressed Chung\u2019s ban, specifying that the \u201cspecific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision,\u201d Brack continued.\n\nBlizzard is just one of many companies facing scrutiny for its relationship to China amid unrest in Hong Kong. Protests in Hong Kong have been building since February, with protesters citing a proposed bill that would allow Hong Kong residents to be extradited to China for trial as a core concern.", "description": "Blizzard has suspended three college Hearthstone players for six months after they held up a sign that read \"Free Hong Kong, Boycott Blizz\" while participating in an official competition stream.
