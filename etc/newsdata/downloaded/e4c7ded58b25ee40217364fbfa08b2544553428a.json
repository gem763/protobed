It said the car would not be aimed at the mass market.\n\nHalf of the funds would go towards building the car, half towards developing electric batteries.\n\nIn October 2018 Dyson revealed plans to build the car at a new plant in Singapore. It was expected to be completed next year with the first vehicles due to roll off the production line in 2021.\n\nDyson wanted to make something revolutionary - but also needed to make it pay. And the sums simply didn't add up.\n\nSales of electric cars are climbing rapidly. Yet they still cost more to make than conventional cars, and generate much lower profits - if any.\n\nMajor manufacturers like VW can afford to plough tens of billions into the EV industry - on the basis that economies of scale will ultimately make the technology cheaper and generate returns.\n\nEven the upstart Tesla, widely credited with showing everyone else just how good electric cars could be, has burnt through mountains of cash and had to go cap in hand to investors.\n\nDyson has concluded it simply can't afford to play with the big boys - although its efforts to make a quantum leap in battery technology will continue.\n\nThe company also planned to invest \u00a3200m in the UK in research and development and test track facilities. Much of that money has already been spent and Dyson said it would use the site for other projects.\n\nThe rest of the funds intended for the electric car project would still be spent on developing other products, including its battery technology, Dyson said.\n\n'Not a product failure'\n\nThe first cars had already been developed and were being tested.\n\nBut in an email on Thursday, Sir James revealed that Dyson was closing electric car facilities both in the UK and Singapore.\n\nThe project employed 523 people, 500 of whom were in UK, and Sir James praised their \"immense\" achievements.\n\n\"This is not a product failure, or a failure of the team, for whom this news will be hard to hear and digest,\" Sir James wrote.\n\nImage copyright Dyson Image caption A Dyson patent diagram from 2019\n\nBut, he said: \"We have tried very hard throughout the development process, we simply can no longer see a way to make it commercially viable.\"\n\n\"The Dyson automotive team has developed a fantastic car; they have been ingenious in their approach while remaining faithful to our philosophies.\"\n\nHe said the firm was trying to find alternative roles for the workers in its home division, which makes things such as vacuum cleaners, fans and hairdryers.\n\nSir James said Dyson would continue to work on the battery technology, which was used in the car.\n\n\"Our battery will benefit Dyson in a profound way and take us in exciting new directions.\"\n\n\"In summary, our investment appetite is undiminished and we will continue to deepen our roots in both the UK and Singapore,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not the first project which has changed direction and it will not be the last.\"", "description": "The British firm, which has already built the first cars, says the project is not commercially viable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0313/production/_109178700_jamesdyson_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
