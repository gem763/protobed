Failing to do so usually carries up to five years behind bars.\n\nRegarding his recent rulings, Cohn noted that Yemen's financial system has been in ruins and people inside the country needed help.\n\n\"Only people without compassion\" would object to the light sentences, Cohn, 95, told The Associated Press. \"As I've been here longer, I've come to the realization that the rules are flexible \u2014 at least to me.\"\n\nThe Detroit area has the highest concentration of Yemenis, a demographic that has risen amid a war in Yemen that has killed tens of thousands of people and left millions more with inadequate food and health care.\n\nThe World Bank estimates that Yemenis received at least $3.3 billion in 2018 \u2013 a conservative figure by some estimates.\n\nFEAR US WEAPONS ARE FALLING INTO THE 'WRONG HANDS' DURING CHAOTIC YEMENI WAR\n\nSince 2018, federal prosecutors in Detroit have charged nine people in an investigation of cash transfers to Yemen. Bank accounts were opened in the names of shell businesses, then used to deposit and wire roughly $90 million over a seven-year period, according to plea agreements.\n\nAll nine men have pleaded guilty to failing to register money transfer businesses or making false statements to agents.\n\nCohn, who has been a judge since 1979, has described the conditions in Yemen as \"horrendous,\u201d noting that sending men to prison could cause hardship in conservative Muslim families where wives often don't work outside the home.\n\nNEARLY 100,000 HAVE BEEN KILLED IN ONGOING YEMEN WAR, REPORT FINDS\n\nIt's unfair to \"shed the traditions and practices of your homeland,\" Cohn said to one of the men.\n\nProsecutors said they had no evidence the scheme was anything more than sending money to relatives and possibly avoiding taxes, but they believed sentences within the guidelines were appropriate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJudges don't have to follow sentencing guidelines, and Cohn rejected prison terms.\n\nHe placed six men on supervised release. Three others awaited sentencing.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Several Yemeni expats in the Detroit area\u00a0who pleaded guilty to transferring millions of dollars to their war-torn native country unlawfully will not be going to prison -- after the\u00a0judge cited a need for \"compassion.\"", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
