My children are not gonna sit in on Cabinet meetings.\u201d\n\nAsked specifically whether he thinks Kushner should be tasked with negotiating Middle East peace agreements, Biden laughed. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat credentials does he bring to that?\u201d\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine and China remains an emphasis of Trump\u2019s broadsides against Biden, a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. The younger Biden took a post on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm after his father became the Obama administration\u2019s point man on U.S.-Ukraine relations.\n\nTrump\u2019s focus on finding information about the Biden\u2019s Ukraine connections is now at the heart of a House impeachment inquiry against the president. Ukrainian investigators have found no legal wrongdoing by either Biden.\n\nNoting that, the former vice president blasted social media giant Facebook for allowing the Trump campaign to distribute online ads framing the Bidens as corrupt.\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m glad they brought the Russians down,\u201d Biden said, noting Facebook\u2019s recent decision to shut down accounts that were distributing misinformation, including about Biden. But, the former vice president asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring down the lies that Trump is telling and everybody knows are lies?\u201d\n\nHunter Biden in a recent interview said the only thing his father said to him at the time he took the post at Burisma was, \u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nThe elder Biden told CBS he never got into any details over the firm, which had been the focus on Ukrainian corruption inquiries.\n\n\u201cWhat I meant by that is I hope you\u2019ve thought this through. I hope you know exactly what you\u2019re doing here,\u201d the elder Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I meant. Nothing more than that because I\u2019ve never discussed my business or their business, my sons\u2019 or daughter\u2019s. And I\u2019ve never discussed them because they know where I have to do my job and that\u2019s it and they have to make their own judgments.\u201d\n\nAnd turning the issue back on the president, Biden repeated a line he\u2019s started using on the campaign trail, urging Trump to release his tax returns. \u201cMr. President \u2026 let\u2019s see how straight you are, okay old buddy?\u201d Biden said. \u201cI put out 21 years of mine. You wanna deal with corruption? Start to act like it. Release your tax returns or shut up.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks have not displaced Biden as a duel Democratic front-runner alongside Sen. Elizabeth Warren. But it has nonetheless raised new questions about Biden\u2019s argument that he\u2019d be the best Democrat to take on the Republican president in a general election. And the Biden attack ads Trump and Republicans have financed in early nominating states, combined with Biden\u2019s own lagging fundraising, have led some of his wealthy supporters to openly discuss the possibility of launching an independent political action committee.\n\nBiden\u2019s CBS interview was taped before his recent decision to reverse his previous opposition to such a Super PAC, a move that Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders have indirectly criticized. Biden did address his campaign\u2019s cash balance being dwarfed by Warren and Sanders, saying he\u2019s \u201cnot worried\u201d about raising enough money.\n\nAs to just how he can withstand Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s grassroots fundraising juggernauts, he replied, \u201cI just flat beat them.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nFollow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP .", "description": "Joe Biden called it \"improper\" for President Donald Trump for having his daughter and son-in-law hold positions in the White House, suggesting in a CBS", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/27/a9dfa8_election-2020-joe-biden-98430-democratic-presidential-candidate-vice-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
