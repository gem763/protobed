VAR controversy as Manchester City cuts gap to Liverpool", "language": "en", "text": "(CNN) Defending champion Manchester City closed to within three points of English Premier League leader Liverpool with a comprehensive 3-0 win over promoted Aston Villa Saturday as a fresh row brewed over the use of VAR.\n\nCity was leading 1-0 over a spirited Villa side when from a short corner Kevin de Bruyne's cross found its way into the net in the 65th minute to double its advantage.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if David Silva had got the slightest of touches as the ball beat Tom Heaton, with the Villa keeper also unsighted by Raheem Sterling, who appeared to be in an offside position.\n\nA lengthy check by the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) could not definitively rule if Silva had indeed touched the ball, which would have seen the goal ruled out for offside against Sterling.\n\nManchester City players celebrates after scoring their controversial second goal against Aston Villa at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nTo add to the controversy, Silva had gestured to on-field referee Graham Scott that the ball had touched him, while de Bruyne told BT Sport after the match that he also believed that to be the case.\n\nVilla manager Dean Smith was less than impressed: \"From what I'm led to believe it should have been disallowed because David Silva touched it and Raheem Sterling is impeding our goalkeeper, but we have to leave that to VAR,\" he told BBC Radio.\n\nTo rub salt into the Villa wound, the Premier League later officially awarded the goal to Silva.\n\nAfter review, the Goal Accreditation Panel have awarded Man City's second goal to David Silva\n\n\n\nThe Goal Accreditation Panel is an independent entity which has no affiliation with VAR#MCIAVL https://t.co/rccQnXtrCI \u2014 Premier League (@premierleague) October 26, 2019\n\nMore EPL controversy\n\nLater Saturday, Everton and its under-pressure manager Marco Silva also fell foul of another highly controversial VAR ruling.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin had come off the bench to put the Toffees 2-1 ahead at Brighton in the 74th minute at the Amex Stadium.\n\nBut six minutes later Michael Keane was ruled by VAR to have fouled Aaron Connolly for stepping on his foot to concede the softest of spot kicks.\n\nNeal Maupay slotted home the penalty before Brighton scored a last-gasp winner as Lucas Digne's own goal sunk Everton.\n\nFernandinho sees red\n\nThe in-form Sterling had given Manchester City the lead with a 46th minute strike, his 17th goal in 18 games for club and country, while Ilkay Gundogan added a clinical third against a by then deflated Villa side.\n\nBut further gloss was taken off the City win when Fernandinho was sent off near the end for a second yellow card after a needless foul on Keinan Davis.\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola watches on as Fernandinho leaves the pitch after his late red card in the win over Aston Villa.\n\nWith City struggling for defensive cover his absence through a ban will hardly help the cause of Pep Guardiola's team in the title defense.\n\nLeicester sets new record\n\nHowever, with its next Premier League match against Southampton, who were at the receiving end of a record 9-0 home rout by Leicester City Friday, the loss of the versatile Brazilian is unlikely to be keenly felt.\n\nLeicester's sensational victory, with Ayoze Perez and Jamie Vardy both grabbing hat-tricks, was the biggest away win in the top-flight in the history of English football.\n\nIt also equaled the biggest margin of victory since the Premier League was formed, held by Manchester United since 1995, a 9-0 win over Ipswich Town.\n\n\ud83e\udd2f We've got a mind-blowing stat for your weekend \u2935\ufe0f\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udd8a @LCFC's 9-0 victory at Southampton is the biggest away win EVER in the English top flight.\n\n\n\nThat's a 131-year history for those keeping score at home. pic.twitter.com/AMlNDHBbxL \u2014 #U17WC \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7\u26bd\ufe0f (@FIFAcom) October 25, 2019\n\nIt briefly lifted Leicester into second place in the standings, before Manchester City's win over Villa, while Liverpool looks to extend its advantage again at home to Tottenham Hotspur Sunday.\n\nBundesliga best for Lewandowski\n\nRobert Lewandowski scored the crucial second as Bayern Munich went to the top in a tight Bundesliga title race with a 2-1 win over promoted Union Berlin.\n\nHis 53rd minute goal meant he has scored in each of the opening nine games, breaking the previous eight-game Bundesliga record set by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for Borussia Dortmund in 2015.\n\nRobert Lewandowski celebrates his goal for Bayern Munich in the 2-1 win over Union Berlin to set a new Bundesliga record of scoring in nine straight league games.\n\nThe prolific Polish striker has netted 19 in 13 games this season including the Champions League and German Cup.\n\nHis effort added to a first half goal by Benjamin Pavard for the Bavarian giants with Sebastian Polter pulling one back for Union Berlin with a penalty in the 86th.\n\nWith Borussia Dortmund and Schalke scoreless in their clash, Bayern is one point clear of Freiburg after nine rounds, but Wolfsburg can top the standings with a home win over Augsburg Sunday.\n\nJuventus held\n\nMeanwhile, in Serie A, defending champion Juventus was held to a disappointing 1-1 draw at lowly Lecce.\n\nPaulo Dybala put Juve ahead with a 50th minute penalty, but the home side equalized from the spot six minutes later with Marco Mancosu on target.\n\nJuventus coach Mauricio Sarri rested star player Cristiano Ronaldo ahead of two Serie A games in four days next week, but would have been relieved as closest rival Inter Milan fluffed its chance to go top, held 2-2 at home by Parma later Saturday.\n\nIt took a 51st minute equalizer from summer signing Romelu Lukaku to salvage a point for Inter, leaving the Nerazzurri a point adrift of Juve at the top of the league.", "description": "Defending champion Manchester City closed to within three points of English Premier League leader Liverpool with a comprehensive 3-0 win over promoted Aston Villa
