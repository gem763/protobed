She\u2019s got a son,\u201d Trump said before quickly adding the word \u201ctogether.\u201d He called their son Barron a \u201cbeautiful young man,\u201d adding that Melania \u201cfeels very, very strongly\u201d about this issue.\n\n\u201cNice save, buddy,\u201d Colbert said with a sarcastic clap. Then, as the president, he added, \u201cFirst lady has got a son\u2014together\u2014it\u2019s a mutual son, of course, I\u2019m very involved with the doings of it, and so is the first lady, who is a lovely mother, together, who I love and know her name so well that I won\u2019t waste your time saying it out loud. So\u2026Tim Apple.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, on The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also noticed the slip from the president, saying, \u201c\u2018She\u2019s got a son?\u2019 You mean the son she made with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow on earth does Trump forget that he has a son?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cHe\u2019s like the world\u2019s worst dad,\u201d he added, comparing the president to Darth Vader.\n\nBut \u201cat least Darth Vader claimed his son,\u201d the host added, joking that Trump would have said, \u201cLuke, she is your mother.\u201d", "description": "\u201cShe\u2019s got a son,\u201d the president said of his wife during his announcement about possibly banning flavored e-cigarettes on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568253170/SC_2_eo0umu", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
