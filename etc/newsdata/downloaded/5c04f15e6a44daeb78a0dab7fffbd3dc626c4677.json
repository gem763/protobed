At the same time, the South Korean tech giant cannot match Samsung's volume and yield rate when it comes to providing display panels for the more profitable mobile OLEDs.\n\nLG Display posted operating losses of 369 billion won in the second quarter of 2019 with revenues of 5.35 trillion won, which was much lower than analysts' expectations.\n\nBut the company has increased the production capacity of its OLED factories in China and South Korea, with the goal of moving 10 million large-sized panels by 2022 to decrease unit cost and increase sales.\n\nLG Display has also commenced the restructuring of its LCD business, halting some of its factory lines and lowering production output, and will likely now make even tougher measures under new leadership.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nLG's Q2 profit drops due to low OLED and mobile sales\n\nLG's second quarter profit saw a 15.4% decline from lower TV profits and sales and losses from mobile, but overall sales increased 4.1% thanks to record sales from its home appliances business.\n\nLG's OLED TV strategy needs to change or face mobile's plight\n\nLG's second quarter profit has been hit hard by declines in OLED TV sales and rival Samsung's QLED onslaught. It's time for LG to drop its over-confidence and pursue a more aggressive pricing model and better warranties for its OLED TVs.\n\nFear and Trembling: LG Display faces the axe for OLED burn-in and market squeeze\n\nAfter seven years of ignoring the warning signs, LG Display's OLED TV panel business is facing a reckoning by LG Group's leadership and the market as rival Samsung jumps to MicroLED and QD-OLED panels.\n\nLG to unveil V60 ThinQ smartphone at IFA 2019\n\nLG has sent out an invitation for the unveiling of its yet unnamed next flagship smartphone to take place at IFA on September 6 that hints at strong gaming feature and dual-screen support.\n\nSamsung, Huawei, LG, and Sony phones vulnerable to rogue 'provisioning' messages\n\nFake phone provisioning messages can allow hackers to hijack email or web traffic from legitimate devices. Nearly half of all Android smartphones impacted.", "description": "LG Display is expected to commence a tough restructuring on its money-losing Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) business and hopes to increase the profitability of its OLED display panels under new leadership.", "authors": ["Cho Mu-Hyun"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/01/31/2f227739-5940-48d1-97e1-3e1f300cb640/thumbnail/770x578/7493920cc8dddae16ca4264723a8ea2e/009-lg-oledb8p.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
