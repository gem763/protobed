Week 7 offers up juicy matchups and we are here to help you make money off of them. USA TODAY\n\nFRISCO, Texas \u2014The Cowboys kept their party line intact for four days.\n\nYes, players said from Monday through Thursday, they knew Eagles coach Doug Pederson told a Philadelphia radio station his team would beat Dallas to take over first place in the NFC East.\n\nNo, they added, they didn\u2019t much care. Pederson is entitled to his opinion. The Cowboys didn\u2019t need outside motivation. Why shouldn\u2019t a coach express confidence in his players?\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want him to be coaching me if he wouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d quarterback Dak Prescott even added.\n\nThen defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence met with the media at his locker on Friday. Reporters gathered around Lawrence as he slipped pink Nikes atop green socks lined with footballs from his seat in the corner. The always-authentic Cowboys captain was asked about Pederson\u2019s win assurance.\n\n\u201cTell him to come on,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready. Can he play the game?\u201d\n\nNot anymore, a reporter answered.\n\n\u201cSo he might want to shut his ass up and stay on the sideline,\u201d Lawrence continued. \u201cHe can\u2019t play the game for them. The Eagles got to come play \u2019em and he\u2019s supposed to sit on the sideline and do whatever he wants to do. But he can\u2019t play the game for them. So we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThis divisional matchup of .500 teams doesn\u2019t mark the first time Lawrence has preceded a game with fodder. Lawrence mentioned choking out the Saints ahead of a 2018 matchup. Then his defense limited Drew Brees\u2019 attack to power a 13-10 Cowboys win.\n\nDak Prescott on Doug Pederson comments: \"I hope he would say that. I wouldn't want him to be coaching me if he wouldn't say that.\"\n\n\n\nAdded later: \"I like our chances this Sunday.\" pic.twitter.com/YEMhA868eo \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 17, 2019\n\nThe Cowboys defense has been less consistent this season. They\u2019ve created pressure at some points and are among league leaders in limiting third-down conversions. But opponents \u2014 even the previously winless Jets \u2014 have torched them on big plays. The run defense allowed Aaron Jones to score four times for the Packers by ground. Lawrence himself has started more slowly from a sack standpoint (2.5 in six games) than the last two seasons, when he combined for 25 sacks and consecutive Pro Bowl berths. He doesn\u2019t doubt his team\u2019s ability to rebound from its three-game skid.\n\n\u201cWe went through this before,\u201d said Lawrence, a member of the Cowboys\u2019 three consecutive 3-3 squads. \u201cWe\u2019ve done seen hell and done dug out the pits of it. We was 3-5 last year. You guys asking the same questions. What is it to fear? We all men, we already know what we got to do.\u201d\n\nDallas Cowboys defensive end Demarcus Lawrence gestures after being called for a penalty in the second quarter against the New Orleans Saints. (Photo: Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nLawrence has seen double teams and chips regularly this year, though he doesn\u2019t let protections or injury (he surgically repaired a shoulder his shoulder this offseason) merit reason for excuse. Sure, he says, missing offseason and training camp work with teammates has meant they\u2019re figuring out run fits and tackling assignments later in the season than they\u2019d like. Opponents have overcome an attack with Lawrence coming from left and Robert Quinn (five sacks in four games) from the right. The Cowboys\u2019 14 sacks rank 15th in the league even as their 45 quarterback pressures rank fifth.\n\n\"Fatigue makes a coward out of anybody,\" Cowboys DE DeMarcus Lawrence said. \"So it\u2019s all about really keeping the pressure on their throats at all times.\" \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 18, 2019\n\n\u201cIt can get a little frustrating, but you can\u2019t let it overwhelm you,\u201d Lawrence said of the still-evolving pass rush. \u201cIt\u2019s the NFL. Everyone\u2019s good. [Jaylon Smith] said great, but I don\u2019t know about great. Everybody\u2019s good.\n\n\u201cSky\u2019s still the limit and we ain\u2019t reach it yet so we still got work to do.\u201d\n\nAgainst the Eagles, Lawrence and the Cowboys will focus that work toward defending their NFC East lead and proving Pederson\u2019s prediction wrong. Don\u2019t worry, Lawrence said, about his recent role in the rotation or the defense\u2019s other struggles.\n\n\u201cDoug Pederson already called us out,\u201d Lawrence said \u201cSo y\u2019all know what it is. Thank y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports\u2019 Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein", "description": "Responding to Doug Pederson guaranteeing a Philly win, the Cowboys' DeMarcus Lawrence told the Eagles coach to shut up and stay on the sideline.", "authors": ["Jori Epstein", "Published P.M.
