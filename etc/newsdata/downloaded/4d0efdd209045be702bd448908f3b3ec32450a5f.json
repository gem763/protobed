He avoided the draft in Vietnam. He fell out with his once-beloved generals. He stunned the world by pulling troops out of Syria and abandoning America\u2019s Kurdish allies.\n\nRelated: Blow to Trump as DoJ ordered to turn over evidence from Mueller grand jury\n\nBut on the political battlefield, the president has shown how he and his allies intend to fight impeachment: with a blitzkrieg aimed at deflecting, distracting and discrediting. What he lacks in coherent strategy, he makes up for in shock and awe. Trump will send in the tanks and take no prisoners.\n\nIt appears that most Republicans are still willing to march behind him, not by defending what many see as indefensible \u2013 the president\u2019s offer of a quid pro quo to Ukraine \u2013 but by throwing sand into the gears of the impeachment process. With the help of Fox News, they are set to intensify attacks on the legitimacy of the inquiry itself, demonising its leaders and sowing doubt wherever possible.\n\nThe great unknown is whether the approach will prove as effective as their efforts to undermine the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, potentially boosting Trump in the 2020 election, or the case against him will be so compelling that he will be removed from office or defeated at the polls.\n\n\u201cTrump is using the same approach he did to subvert the Mueller report: undermining the legitimacy of the messenger, assigning political motives to those who testify and relying on the Fox News firewall to serve up propaganda to his base,\u201d said Kurt Bardella, a former spokesperson and senior adviser for Republicans on the House oversight committee.\n\nNo matter who\u2019s working in the White House, we already know it will be blown to hell by Trump\u2019s tweets on any given day Kurt Bardella\n\n\u201cThe difference is that with Mueller we had a lot of time where we didn\u2019t know anything. In the impeachment inquiry we are getting a steady stream of new information that is providing context.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is a month old. Unlike Mueller it has moved at warp speed, subpoenaing witnesses, gathering testimony and building evidence against the president some say makes it inevitable he will be impeached by the House and put on trial by the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThis week Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, made the most damning allegations yet about a quid pro quo in which Trump threatened to suspend military aid and the offer of a White House meeting unless Ukraine agreed to announce investigations into political rivals including the former vice-president Joe Biden, a potential opponent in next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nTaylor, a respected Vietnam war veteran with half a century of public service, also described an \u201cirregular, informal policy channel\u201d by which the Trump administration was pursuing objectives in Ukraine \u201crunning contrary to the goals of longstanding US policy\u201d. His evidence reportedly prompted \u201ca lot of sighs and gasps\u201d in the hearing room.\n\nThe backlash from Trump was as swift as it was expected. Since the shadow of impeachment fell, the president has put down a daily barrage of tweets. Responding to Taylor and other members of his own party he sees as disloyal, he described \u201cNever Trumper Republicans\u201d as \u201chuman scum\u201d.\n\nSteve Scalise speaks after he and two dozen other Republicans stormed the room used by the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry.

The testimony of a Pentagon official was postponed by more than five hours. The members complained about lack of transparency as evidence is being given behind closed doors.\n\nIt was not their only gambit. Earlier in the week Republicans attempted to censure Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee, for his handling of the impeachment inquiry, only for the Democratic majority to set the resolution aside. On Thursday Lindsey Graham, the chair of the Senate judiciary committee and a Trump loyalist, introduced a resolution condemning the inquiry as an unfair, secretive and designed to embarrass the president.", "description": "A hearing room is invaded, the president\u2019s enemies are \u2018scum\u2019.
