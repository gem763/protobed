Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) because of their need for \u201cmore and more cheap labor,\u201d columnist Ann Coulter says.\n\nIn an interview with Lars Larson, Coulter said America\u2019s giant middle class will continue to be eroded should the billionaire class get their way on immigration where the ultimate goal is hemispheric open borders.\n\n\u201cWe used to have \u2026 the hallmark of America was an enormous, enormous middle class. I mean, something like 80 to 90 percent of Americans describes themselves as middle class,\u201d Coulter said. \u201cYou might be upper or lower within that, but there were not enormous gaps.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, there is a problem with the oligarchs in this country and they\u2019re the ones bringing in the cheap labor and they\u2019re the ones \u2014 not all of them but a lot of them \u2014 who don\u2019t care about the country per se,\u201d Coulter continued. \u201cThey just want more and more cheap labor. And they are going to deliver a country to us like Venezuela through people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News has noted, despite Warren\u2019s populist rhetoric \u2014 where she has called out multinational corporations for having no loyalty to American workers \u2014 her campaign to win the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination has endorsed one of the most open borders platforms of all the candidates.\n\nWarren Undercuts Populist Agenda with Donor Class Immigration Planhttps://t.co/RAdJlUT44k \u2014 John Binder \ud83d\udc7d (@JxhnBinder) August 28, 2019\n\nWarren\u2019s immigration plan includes decriminalizing illegal immigration and providing amnesty to all 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. \u2014 policies that will force America\u2019s working class to compete for scarce blue-collar and middle-income jobs against the world\u2019s migrants.\n\nLikewise, Warren has championed the donor class and Chamber of Commerce\u2019s effort to increase legal immigration to the U.S. and thus driving up foreign competition against middle class and college-educated Americans.\n\nCurrent immigration levels are already helping to hand electoral dominance to Democrats nationwide, research by the New York Times, Axios, and the Atlantic has noted.\n\nThe U.S. is set to bring at least 15 million new foreign-born voters to the country in the next decade. These voters\u2019 swing towards Democrats has been realized in the 2016 presidential election, where despite winning almost 50 percent of native-born Americans, Trump lost foreign-born voters to Hillary Clinton by 64 percent.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
