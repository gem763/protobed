For shame! Unless it's a B&S. Or a barbecue. Or you had a really long day and just want a beer. Here are three ways to hide your booze when you aren't supposed to be drinking.\n\nIn Public: The Drink Can Sleeve\n\nIf you feel like drinking in public but don't to give yourself away, it's easy to hide your booze in any non-alcoholic container. You could put vodka in a water bottle, or whiskey in your cola bottle. I once drank beer at a university open mic night out of a travel coffee mug. Literally anything will do.\n\nBut sometimes, these aren't enough. Sometimes, the authorities are actively looking for people hiding their alcohol in coffee cups (say, at a public park, or the beach). In these situations, it helps to go the extra mile: cut up a Coke can and put it around your beer, like a sleeve. No one's going to look too closely at a Coke can. Well, hopefully. (They also make products designed for this, but why buy something you can make yourself?)\n\nOn A Boat: The Listerine Bottle\n\nDude, stuff alcohol prices on cruises. Want to bring your own on board? Empty out those mouthwash bottles (your breath was fine anyway), pour in some vodka, and add a little food colouring to make it look like the real deal. You can even slip the seal back on to make it look brand new. If you want to go really overboard (no pun intended), you can heat up plastic water bottles to keep the bottle cap seals intact.\n\nAt A Concert: The Upside-Down Potato Crisp Bag\n\nImage: Supplied\n\nThis one is one of my own creation, and can actually be used for non-alcoholic beverages too. Lots of outdoor concert venues let you bring in coolers with snacks, but won't allow alcohol. Some won't even allow you to bring water. So how do you get out of paying excessive prices? Hide them in your crisps!\n\nMy preferred method is to take an empty potato chip bag, throw your beverages of choice inside, and staple it back up. It helps if you open the bag from the bottom (you know, if you have the foresight to do so). Then, stick it in your esky with the rest of your snacks, and \u2014 provided they don't look too closely \u2014 you'll be home free once you get through security Photo by Espensorvik.\n\nOf course, these are far from the only options, and every situation requires its own fine-tuned booze hiding method. Share your own below. And good luck with that hangover the next day.\n\nThis story has been updated since its original publication.", "description": "Drinking in public? For shame! Unless it's a B&S.
