This is believed to be the first deportation from Taiwan linked to the Hong Kong protests.\n\nTaiwan has ruled itself since the end of a civil war in 1949, but China views the island as its territory and has vowed to seize it -- by force if necessary.\n\nRelations between the two sides have plummeted since President Tsai Ing-wen's election in 2016 as her government refuses to acknowledge that Taiwan is part of \"one China\".\n\nShe has warned against any attempt to \"provoke Taiwan's democracy and the rule of law\", saying mainland Chinese who attack Hong Kongers or damage Lennon Walls will be barred from entering Taiwan.\n\nTsai has also pledged to assist Hong Kongers facing prosecution for involvement in anti-government protests who seek sanctuary in Taiwan, sparking a rebuke from Beijing to \"stop meddling\" in the affairs of the city, which was handed back to Beijing by Britain in 1997.\n\nA Hong Kong solidarity rally was held in Taiwan last month. It was largely peaceful, but Hong Kong pop star Denise Ho -- a staunch democracy advocate -- had red paint thrown at her by an unidentified assailant as she spoke to local media.", "description": "Taiwan has expelled a Chinese tourist for damaging a \"Lennon Wall\" that was put up in support of Hong Kong's democracy movement, a move likely to irk Beijing.
