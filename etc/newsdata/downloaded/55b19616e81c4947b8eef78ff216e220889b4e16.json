Euro Is Only Partly to Blame for Currency Pain in Europe\u2019s East\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here.\n\nAt face value, the euro is to blame for the currency slide across eastern Europe, because their economies are enmeshed with the European Union\u2019s supply chains.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to the story.\n\nFrom elections and EU court rulings to government spending and monetary-policy quirks, homegrown headwinds have placed Hungary\u2019s forint, the Polish zloty, the Czech koruna and the Romanian leu among the worst performing emerging-market currencies this month.\n\nIt\u2019s an unusual predicament for assets often considered havens, especially given burgeoning consumerism and growing wages in some countries.\n\nPolish Zloty\n\nThe zloty is feeling the heat of a looming European court verdict on foreign-currency loans. A worst-case scenario where banks would be obliged to convert mortgages to zloty at 2008 exchange rates could mean a loss of as much as four times last year\u2019s annual profit for lenders. Accelerating inflation as well as general elections next month may also hurt the appeal of Polish assets.\n\n\u201cThe 4.40 support has once again stopped the upward movement for now,\u201d said Raiffeisen Bank analyst Dorota Strauch. \u201cIn anticipation of the ruling, however, it is likely that this level will be breached.\u201d\n\nHungarian Forint\n\nThe forint is the worst performer this month, hitting a record low against the euro. A dovish turn from the central bank and a build-up of speculative positioning against the currency have added to its pain. A current-account balance that has turned to a deficit isn\u2019t helping either.\n\nRising liquidity after the central bank\u2019s decision to relax monetary policy, as well as \u201cthe delicate external balance of Hungary and downward squeeze on the euro,\u201d will keep pressure on the forint, according to Citigroup (NYSE: ) strategists Dumitru Vicol and Luis Costa, who have an underweight call for the currency.\n\nCzech Koruna\n\nHawkish overtones from rate setters in Prague haven\u2019t lifted the koruna, whose 0.4% gain to 25.85 per euro this month has lagged emerging peers. Investors are still struggling to sell the koruna in an attempt to exit long bets made during the central bank\u2019s currency cap regime.\n\n\u201cFor some time the transmission mechanism from the interest rate channel into the exchange rate has been broken, with the overbought koruna not reacting to higher rates,\u201d ING strategist Petr Krpata said in an emailed note. The euro-koruna may trend higher in 4Q and test the 26 level, even if policy makers hike rates in November, he said.\n\nRomanian Leu\n\nThe leu has slipped 0.5% this month to 4.7472 per euro, even though it\u2019s the only currency among peers that\u2019s managed by the central bank. A twin deficit, a government crisis and above-target inflation paint an ugly backdrop.\n\n\u201cThe leu remains one of the most overvalued currencies in CEE and this step-by-step weakening will not eliminate overvaluation,\u201d said Dan Bucsa, an analyst at UniCredit SpA. He sees the trading range shifting to 4.8-4.9 per euro in the first quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cThe central bank may have to use its reserves to defend the currency next year if appetite for emerging-market assets weakens.\u201d", "description": "Euro Is Only Partly to Blame for Currency Pain in Europe\u2019s East", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF1O0S6_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
