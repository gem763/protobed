It uses that data to build an advertising profile, serving users with ads that it thinks will match their demographics.\n\nBy clicking a link from a Google account's settings page, users can see what Google thinks it knows about them. Google predicts users' age, gender, marital status, income, and personal interests.\n\nThe page also allows users to correct Google's assumptions, remove their information from Google's ad database, or stop Google from predicting their profile entirely going forward.\n\nI sifted through my Google ad settings to learn what Google thinks it knows about me. Some of its predictions were off-base, but most were eerily accurate (and a few were comically specific based on recent Google searches I've made).\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how to see what Google thinks it knows about you, and how to delete your information from Google's database.\n\nFirst, navigate to your Google account homepage by clicking the widget in the top right corner of any Google site.\n\nFrom there, you'll see a link to \"Privacy & personalisation.\" Click \"Manage your data & personalisation\" to see more options.\n\nThe profile Google has predicted based on your history is found under \"Ad personalisation.\" Click on \"Go to ad settings\" to see the full profile.\n\nYou'll be greeted with a message describing ad personalisation. If you don't want Google to track any personal information for ad purposes, you can switch ad personalisation to OFF on this screen.\n\nIf you aren't able to find this page from your settings, you should be able to reach it at this link.\n\nWhen you scroll down, you'll see a list of attributes that Google has predicted about you, including your age, gender, and interests.\n\nClicking on any of the items in the list will pull up a menu that allows you to update the information to correct Google's assumption.\n\nIn my case, Google was pretty far off - I'm 23, a far cry from the 35-to-64-year-old window. To be fair, I checked my ad profile using my work email account, which I pretty much only use at the office.\n\nFor most of the settings, you can also \"turn off\" the tracking, which will stop Google from using its predictions in that category to serve you ads.\n\nSome of Google's predictions are scarily accurate.\n\nGoogle correctly guessed that I have a bachelor's degree, despite the fact that I've never explicitly input that information into any Google account or website.\n\nGoogle may even make predictions about your living situation.\n\nIn this case, I was surprised that Google accurately predicted I rent my apartment.\n\nSome of the interests Google predicts are oddly specific.\n\nThe predictions Google makes can be comically fine-tuned. Google has profiled me as someone interested in \"unwanted body & facial hair removal\" - while I searched for places to buy a safety razor a couple weeks ago, I wouldn't call the topic one of my primary interests.\n\nWhen you opt to turn off ad personalisation, you'll see this message reminding you that ads will still appear, but be less targeted to you.\n\nGoogle also states that it will keep using \"general\" information like your location and the time of day to target ads to you when you turn off personalisation.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "By clicking a link from Google's account settings page, users can find out what the tech giant thinks it knows about them.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7993/cbb61dbac5f74d2191dde45593e86949.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
