The Nasdaq Composite Index retreated 91 points, or 1.1%, to close at 7,908.68. The small-capitalization Russell 2000 index saw a steeper drop, losing 1.9% to 1,493.43.\n\nThe S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Sept. 4.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nWall Street will be closely watching the Automatic Data Processing Inc.'s private-sector employment report for signs of weakness in the U.S. economy after the Institute for Supply Management's survey on manufacturing registered at 47.8, down from 49.1 in July, below the 50.2 estimated by economists polled by MarketWatc, representing the worst reading since June 2009 (link). Any reading below 50 indicates contraction.\n\nThe ADP payrolls report comes ahead of the more closely followed nonfarm-payroll report due on Friday, but holds particular significance given Tuesday's manufacturing results, which spooked investors, reviving fears of a slowdown in the U.S. as the rest of the world's economy faces a slowdown.\n\nEconomists polled by Econoday estimate that private-sector employment for September will come in at 152,000, which would compare with 195,000 for ADP in August. The ADP reading is set for 8:15 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\n\"ADP data could reverse negative market economic sentiment if the data comes in at a respectable level. This would indicate the private sectors has not yet pulled the plug on hiring helping investor's to shake off the fears of a slowdown leading to recession,\" wrote Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, in a Wednesday report.\n\nSigns of weakness in the U.S. economy may prompt the Federal Reserve to further dial back interest rates, which have been cut by half a percentage point in back-to-back central-bank policy meetings, market participants said\n\nHow did other markets trade?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down nearly 2 basis points to 1.63% on Wednesday.\n\nIn commodities markets, West Texas Intermediate crude-oil for November delivery was up 7 cents, or less than 0.1%, to $53.68 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nGold for December delivery added 70 cents, or less than 0.1%, to reach $1,489.50 an ounce.\n\nIn Asia, Chinese equity benchmarks were closed in observance of the 70th anniversary of Communist rule. Japan's Nikkei 225 meanwhile, fell 0.5%, wiping out a similar loss from Monday. European stocks traded lower, with the Stoxx Europe 600 down 1.6%.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 02, 2019 07:17 ET (11:17 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
