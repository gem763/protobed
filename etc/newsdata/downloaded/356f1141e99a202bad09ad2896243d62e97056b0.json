We find this \u2018sharing\u2019 to be greatest among our newest diners, in our newest markets, but believe it is happening to some degree throughout our diner base.\u201d\n\nSee: Beyond Meat\u2019s McDonald\u2019s trial hasn\u2019t been a \u2018blowout,\u2019 Bernstein analysts say\n\nGrubhub GRUB, +2.69% has a strategy that it\u2019s going to implement over the next 12-to-18 months \u201cto increase restaurant supply aggressively while making our diner experience more sticky.\u201d Small- and medium-sized businesses are a focus.\n\nOn the earnings call, Matthew Maloney, Grubhub\u2019s chief executive, began by walking back the shareholder letter, saying that the conditions described are true for the industry, not just Grubhub.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, a very small fraction of our diners use other platforms in general and the newer of our diners use multiple [platforms] with a much greater frequency,\u201d he said, according to a FactSet transcript. \u201cThe older cohorts are definitely more stable, but we think that small parts of those cohorts are testing the waters at different points and that\u2019s why closing the restaurant gap is so important.\u201d\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch analysts weren\u2019t reassured.\n\n\u201cWe are downgrading Grubhub to underperform from buy as we now expect higher customer acquisition cost but also potentially shorter lifetime values for acquired customers driven by lower order frequency and repeat rates,\u201d analysts led by Nat Schindler wrote.\n\nAlso: McDonald\u2019s expected to jump into the chicken sandwich war next year: KeyBanc\n\n\u201cThe food delivery market is increasingly irrational as competitors flood the market with rewards and incentives, making online diners less loyal.\u201d\n\nBank of America slashed its price objective to $30 from $98.\n\nDow Jones Market Data Group\n\nGrubhub was also downgraded at Oppenheimer, to underperform from outperform. Analysts dropped their price target to $34 from $91.\n\n\u201cCompetitive food delivery offerings (Uber UBER, +4.10% , DoorDash and others) are eroding Grubhub usage (orders/dinner -15% year-over-year vs. -11% in Q2) and expected to worsen in Q4, suggesting historical lifetime value is no longer reliable,\u201d analysts wrote.\n\nIn Grubhub\u2019s letter, the company said it plans to double the number of restaurants on its platform by the end of 2020, help with loyalty programs, and take other steps.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Chipotle\u2019s carne asada supply is running low, bringing the limited-time offer to an early end\n\nBTIG analysts say there\u2019s no telling how long these measures will take to show results.\n\n\u201cWe view this as a material change in tone and strategy, which could take several years to bear fruit that will not be well received by investors,\u201d analysts said in a note before the earnings call.\n\n\u201cAside from incremental spending to defend market share and increase restaurant inventory, we are unclear as to the path forward from here. Given the turmoil many of these delivery platforms are enduring, we believe consolidation is becoming more likely.\n\nBTIG rates Grubhub stock buy with a $95 price target.\n\nGrubhub stock has lost nearly 62% over the past year while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.33% has gained 13.6% for the period.\n\nFounded in 2004, and based in Chicago, Grubhub is an online food ordering and delivery platform that connects diners with local takeout restaurants. As of Q1 2019, the company had about 20 million active users and 115,000 associated restaurants across 2,200 cities in the U.S.", "description": "Grubhub said in a shareholder letter that customers aren\u2019t as loyal as they used to be.", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HI649_grubhu_ZG_20190501162852.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
