We might see Tyson Fury have his MMA debut this year too. It's different but like I say, Tyson Fury is taking over.\"\n\nWhile a switch to MMA would be quite a change for the heavyweight, Fury said he would be getting some help from Conor McGregor to train, and even teased a potential fight card with both himself and McGregor on the bill.\n\n\"I've been speaking to Conor about it and he will train me,\" Fury said. \"It's going to be good.\"\n\n\u2014Sky Sports News (@SkySportsNews) October 27, 2019\n\nFury seemed drawn to the brutal nature of MMA.\n\n\"I come from a long line of bare-knuckle boxing champions,\" Fury said. \"Getting hurt, getting blood you saw my last fight, blood everywhere \u2014 nothing new to me. [It's] all a part of my heritage and upbringing, so I'd love to get in there and smash someone up.\"\n\nOn Twitter, McGregor responded, seemingly excited to begin working with Fury.\n\nFury is currently promoting his WWE debut, which will take place on Thursday at WWE Crown Jewel in Saudi Arabia, where he will take on Braun Strowman. With this in mind, it's highly likely that Fury's MMA tease is a promotional bluster, but the idea of him in the octagon is quite enticing.\n\nAs things stand, Fury's fighting future is somewhat up in the air. Speaking with BBC Sport, Fury said he was planning three boxing matches for 2020 \u2014 two against Deontay Wilder and a \"farewell fight\" for December.\n\n\"I am 31, getting long in the tooth for the sport,\" Fury said. \"There are young men coming up and father time catches up with everyone.\"\n\nShould Fury decide to hang up his gloves, a future in WWE might be in the cards, depending on how his debut at Crown Jewel goes. A post-boxing career in MMA seems more unlikely, but if Fury decided to put his mind to it, there's little reason to doubt him.\n\nA Nigerian fighter is being hailed as the new Conor McGregor because of his showmanship, flashy fight style, and new-found championship status\n\nJorge Masvidal says Dana White won't let him fight Conor McGregor in case he ends up murdering him\n\nConor McGregor calls for a rematch in Moscow after Khabib Nurmagomedov retains UFC lightweight title against Dustin Poirier\n\nHow Conor McGregor went from Dublin plumber to the king of combat sports", "description": "Tyson Fury is a man of many talents, but a switch to MMA would be quite a change of pace for the heavyweight.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db60d7cdee01973dc753582?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
