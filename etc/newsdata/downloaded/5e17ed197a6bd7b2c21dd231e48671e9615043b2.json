Increased STI treatments and birth control options could also play a role, according to a gynecologist.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more.\n\nIn Hawaii, instances of the sexually transmitted infections chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are the highest they've been in 30 years, according to the Honolulu Star Advertiser, a trend that's in line with national and global STI rates.\n\nA June 6 report from the World Health Organization found STIs \u2014 bacterial, viral, or parasitc infections transmitted through sexual contact \u2014 are spreading at an alarming rate worldwide, with 1 million new STIs occurring in people between the ages of 15 and 49 every day.\n\nIn 2016, the year the WHO collected the report data, there were 127 million new cases of chlamydia, 87 million of gonorrhea, and 6.3 million of syphilis.\n\nIn Hawaii, there were 7,732 cases of chlamydia, 1,496 of gonorrhea, and 180 of syphilis in 2018, according to state health officials. These STI rates have more than doubled over the last ten years.\n\n\"All three are [near or] at their highest rates in about 30 years,\" Gerald Hasty, program coordinator for the state Department of Health Harm Reduction Services Branch, told the Star Advertiser. \"The fact that they're all increasing is not desirable but it's also not unexpected.\"\n\nHasty also said the increase in STIs could be due in part to an increase in digital dating, although no data exists to prove online dating sites or dating apps are to blame. Other factors, like advances in STI treatments and new birth control methods could also play a role.\n\nOfficials believe dating apps play a major role in skyrocketing STI rates\n\ndating app in dark More\n\nOlena Zaskochenko / Shutterstock\n\nAccording to Hasty, the popularity of online dating has led to more STIs in Hawaii.\n\n\"As people rely on digital means of making connections it can lead to circumstances where they might be more exposed to infection without them knowing it,\" Hasty said. \"More partners, more chances to get infections.\"\n\nCertainly, dating via the internet or mobile app has become less stigmatized in recent years and is now the most common way singles meet other singles. A February 2016 report from Pew Research Center found that 41% of Americans said they knew someone who uses online dating platforms like websites or dating apps, and 15% of Americans said they've used some form of online dating in their lives.\n\nRead more: 7 common infections that can be caused by sex\n\nBut no data exists to show people are having more sex because they're matching with more prospective partners, or that they're having more unsafe sex with these prospective matches.\n\nIn fact, research has shown millennials and members of Generation Z are having less sex than previous generations. In 2018, the share of Americans who said they didn't have sex for an entire year was the highest on record, suggesting that dating apps don't actually lead to more sex.\n\nIt's possible the impersonal nature of dating apps has led to more unprotected sex, under the assumption people are less willing to openly discuss their STI status with a perfect stranger they just met online. Still, the dating app-STI link isn't more than a theory at this point.\n\nScientific advancements in sexual health could have made STIs more prevalent", "description": "While online dating may make it easier to meet more partners, there's no proof people are having more sex or more unprotected sex.", "authors": ["Julia Naftulin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LHH2pn01lmiWY8TuwrqV0w--~B/aD0xNDg4O3c9MTk4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/f2b47228a6c2415afab8d1da1bcfa014", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
