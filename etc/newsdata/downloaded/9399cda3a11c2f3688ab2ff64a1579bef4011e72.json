But, he added, \u201cI sure as hell believe that it would work in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all going to come down to.\u201d\n\nThe church-state divide shouldn\u2019t dissuade the candidates, McCurry told me. \u201cThat\u2019s such a misreading of what the political DNA of America is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had religion woven into our political structures and our political debate from the very beginning.\u201d\n\nBesides, he added, a Democrat who speaks persuasively about religion has a potentially huge tactical advantage: \u201cThink ahead to the general election. If you\u2019re talking about faith in an authentic, genuine way, imagine the contrast if you\u2019re running against Donald Trump, who has absolutely none of that vocabulary.\u201d While the president may have the farthest reaches of the religious right locked down, many Americans of faith are appalled by him.", "description": "", "authors": ["Frank Bruni", "Nytimes.Com Opinion"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
