South Korean Kim Chang-ho completed the challenge one month faster \u2014 although unlike Kukuczka and also Purja, he never used supplementary oxygen.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Project possible\u2019 \u2013\n\nPurja, a former member of the Gurkhas \u2014 a brigade of Nepalis in British army famous for their fearlessness \u2014 as well as the elite Special Boat Service, kicked off \u201cProject Possible\u201d in April.\n\nIn the first part of his record attempt, Purja ticked off Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Kanchenjunga, Everest, Lhotse and Makalu in just one month.\n\nHe was not alone on Everest, reaching the summit on May 22 with 320 others and snapping a photo of a traffic jam of climbers on the world\u2019s highest mountain that went viral.\n\nThis season a record 885 people climbed the famous mountain. A total of 11 people died, with at least four of those deaths blamed on overcrowding.\n\nA month later, Purja headed to Pakistan for the second part, where he first tackled the notorious Nanga Parbat at 8,125 metres.\n\nBattling sleep deprivation to meet his target, Purja said he was almost sprinting up and down five of Pakistan\u2019s highest peaks including Gasherbrum I, Gasherbrum II and K2, the second highest in the world.\n\nTwenty-three days later he was standing atop Broad Peak, his fifth and final mountain of the second phase.\n\nPurja began his final push in September, reaching the tops of Cho Oyu and Manaslu within a week.\n\nTuesday\u2019s summit of Shishapangma was the final hurdle.\n\nWhen he first told others about his new quest, \u201ceveryone was laughing at me,\u201d Purja told AFP in a recent interview in Kathmandu as he awaited permission from the Chinese government to tackle Shishapangma.\n\nHe said then he wanted his feats to inspire the next generation of Nepali climbers to break his records.\n\nSherpas \u2014 Nepalis who often work as guides for foreign mountaineers \u2014 are the backbone of the lucrative climbing industry, but don\u2019t attract anywhere near the same amount of attention or accolades as their international companions.\n\n\u201cInternational attention and sponsors rush easily towards foreign climbers but Nepalis don\u2019t get such opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\nPurja\u2019s record was yet to be verified independently, although he has individual summit certificates from Nepal and Pakistan and will apply to Guinness World Records for recognition, his expedition organisers said.\n\nHe also said he broke seven other records, including the fastest summit of the world\u2019s three highest mountains and climbing Everest, Lhotse and Makalu in 48 hours.", "description": "Kathmandu (AFP) \u2013 A Nepali mountaineer on Tuesday smashed the speed record for summiting the world\u2019s 14 highest peaks, racing up all", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/e62fcc_picture-released-by-nirmal-nims-purja-bremont-project-shows-climber-on-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
