But Craig, who testified in his own defense, was adamant that he never lied to anyone and that he did not register for the simple reason that he was not required to.\n\nAt issue was a report that Craig and his then-law firm were hired to produce for the government of Ukraine on the prosecution of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko. The purpose of the project was to evaluate the fairness of Tymoshenko\u2019s trial and to produce a report that Ukraine hoped could burnish its standing in the international community.\n\nCraig testified that the sole purpose of conversations he had with reporters was to correct mischaracterizations of the report and spin coming from Ukraine about its conclusions.\n\nCraig, who is now retired, has represented a litany of powerful political figures in his decades-long legal career. He worked on President Bill Clinton\u2019s defense during impeachment proceedings, and also represented former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards and James Cartwright, a retired general and former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Craig also served as an adviser to the late Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.", "description": "The prominent Washington attorney was found not guilty of lying to the Justice Department about the work he did for the Ukrainian government.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7011063b00004900cd6f49.jpeg?cache=avhikh4ext&ops=1778_1000"}
