But Kendrick got himself caught on the basepath in the bottom of that inning, and had he played it safe, Washington could have extended a rally to answer Los Angeles\u2019.\n\nWith the bases full and no outs, Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera hit a sacrifice fly to right and Juan Soto scored from third. But Kendrick hesitated for a split second before breaking for third, and the Dodgers were able to tag him out for a 9-3-5 double play.\n\n\u201cYou know what? I should have trusted my instincts to be honest with you,\u201d Kendrick told reporters. \u201cMy first instincts were right, I kind of shut it down a little bit, went back to the bag. At that point, I should have just stopped and stayed there. Kind of helped them out of the inning there and sometimes those little things are what kills rallies.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals were not able to score after that play. Manager Dave Martinez said Kendrick was trying to be \u201coverly aggressive.\n\n\u201cHe started, stopped, then started again. For me, if he had went right away, he makes it. Once you stop, then that\u2019s it, you\u2019ve gotta get back. He knew that. He\u2019s a veteran guy. Yeah, it was frustrating.\u201d\n\nKendrick has started every playoff game at either first or second base for Washington. Game 4 is Monday at 6:40 p.m., with the Dodgers a win away from knocking the Nationals out and advancing to the NLCS.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
