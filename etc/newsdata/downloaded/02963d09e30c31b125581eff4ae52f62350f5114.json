Therefore, the fight continues,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier this month, the peace court that handles the conflict\u2019s worst crimes excluded the dissidents from the benefits outlined in the agreement so that they can be tried in the regular justice system, should they be arrested.\n\nColombian President Ivan Duque\u2019s government claims Marquez and his associates are hiding in Venezuela, where leaders of Colombia\u2019s last active guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (ELN), are also seeking refuge, according to official accounts.\n\nNegotiated with United Nations support, the 2016 peace accord ended the insurrection by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and turned it into a political party called the Common Alternative Revolutionary Force.\n\nWhile some 13,000 guerillas were demobilized, around 2,300 combatants remain, and are involved in drug trafficking and illegal mining, according to military intelligence.\n\nThat figure includes rebels who rejected the agreement, plus new recruits.
