The Dealmaster is back with another round of deals to share. Today's list is headlined by a deal on 12-month membership cards for Sony's PlayStation Plus service, as they're down to $39 on eBay today. While that's not an unprecedented sale price, it matches the subscription's going rate on Black Friday and comes in well below Sony's standard $60 price. (Though it's not uncommon to find it closer to $50 online.)\n\nNote that this deal applies to physical membership cards, not digital codes, so you'll have to wait a few days to top off your subscription. As was the case with a similar deal we saw a couple months back, the eBay retailer here is \" neogames ,\" which isn't a household name by any means but has highly favorable user reviews and has run several deals along these lines that we've found to be trustworthy in the past. In any event, PlayStation Plus is needed to access online multiplayer in most PlayStation games and still gives out a couple of complimentary games each month. You can still stack any code bought here on top of your existing membership, and there has been nothing to suggest the service's role will change with the upcoming PlayStation 5\n\nIf you don't want to commit any more time to PlayStation, we also have deals on a Nintendo Switch and Amazon gift card bundle, recommended USB-C PD power banks and car dash cams, Google's Pixel 3a, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and more. Have a look for yourself below.\n\nDealmaster: An Ars newsletter The Dealmaster is launching its very own newsletter!
