The public will have to choose whether they want to get Brexit done with Boris or whether they want to spend 2020 having two referendums on Brexit and Scotland with Corbyn.\"\n\nIt comes as Britain faces fresh chaos as the Prime Minister was forced to abandon his \"do or die\" October 31 deadline vow and ask the EU for a further delay to the UK's departure.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nEarlier today Boris Johnson lost a vote on his preferred timetable for passing Brexit legislation.\n\nHe was forced to pause the process and to ask the EU to decide on what he called Parliament's request for a further delay to Britain's departure.\n\nThe PM \"paused\" his Brexit deal after the House of Commons refused to accept a bid to rush it through in three days.\n\nThe day's events sees the PM forced to abandon his \"do or die\" vows to leave the EU by the October 31 deadline - in just nine days' time.\n\nDowning Street earlier today refused to confirm the UK would still leave by the hard-line deadline of Halloween .\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nInstead Mr Johnson said: \"One way or another we will leave the EU with this deal to which the House has just given its assent.\"\n\nThe development saw EU chief Donald Tusk confirm he would ask the bloc's 27 members states to agree to Mr Johnson's forced request for a three-month delay, in an effort to avoid a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe EU members do not have to accept the request, and can force a shorter extension.\n\nMr Johnson was backed into reluctantly requesting the extension on Saturday, after MPs forced his hand.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMPs today voted by 322 to 308 to defeat the Government's programme motion to pass Mr Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement, which would put his Brexit deal into law.\n\nEarlier, he had received some backing from MPs after they voted on a second reading- making Mr Johnson's Brexit deal the first to pass the initial Commons hurdle since the 2016 Leave vote.\n\nEven 19 Labour MPs who broke ranks with their party's opposition to the deal to back it at its second reading today.\n\nJeremy Corbyn offered to enter talks with Mr Johnson about the way forward following today's result as the humiliated Tory leader was forced to abandon his timetable.\n\nLabour's leader said: \"Work with all of us to agree a reasonable timetable, and I suspect this House will vote to debate, scrutinise \u2013 and I hope amend \u2013 the detail of this Bill.\"", "description": "Justice Secretary Richard Burgon has said that Labour will back an election if no-deal is ruled out by the EU granting a three month extension", "authors": ["Oliver Milne", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703698.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_election.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
