Asthma is a common but incurable condition which affects the small tubes inside the lungs. It can cause them to become inflamed, or swollen, which restricts the airways and makes it harder to breathe. The condition affects people of all ages and often starts in childhood. Symptoms may improve or even go away as children grow older, but can return in adulthood. Symptoms include wheezing, breathlessness, a tight chest and coughing, and these may get worse during an asthma attack. Treatment usually involves medication which is inhaled to calm down the lungs. Triggers for the condition include allergies, dust, air pollution, exercise and infections such as cold or flu. If you think you or your child has asthma you should visit a doctor, because it can develop into more serious complications like fatigue or lung infections.

Xolair blocks these chemicals.\n\nThe study did not look into why biologics are not being prescribed.\n\nThe scientists speculate patients may be failing to explain their condition to their doctor, with medics also not assessing asthma sufferers thoroughly enough.\n\n'Now there is an increasing number of biologic asthma drugs available that avoid the need for oral steroids, doctors should initiate biologic treatment in suitable patients to reduce exposure to harmful oral steroids,' Ms Eger said.\n\n'Every prescription for oral steroids should alert doctors to assess adherence to inhaled therapies and inhalation techniques in these patients.'\n\nChanging how asthma is managed may also benefit the economy.\n\n'If [doctors] reduce exposure to harmful oral steroids and thus reduce the adverse effects, this could lead to a reduction in the cost of healthcare,' Ms Eger said.\n\n'Another important way to look at this, is patients can exercise more and experience fewer exacerbations of their disease, and so have fewer days off work due to illness.'\n\nDr Samantha Walker, director of research and policy at Asthma UK, added: 'While long-term oral steroids can be life-saving for many people, for some they can cause toxic side effects such as a diabetes and osteoporosis.\n\n'And our own research shows they can cause weight gain and lead to difficultly falling asleep.\n\n'New biologic drugs can transform the lives of people with severe asthma but tens of thousands of patients in England are unable to access them because they are not being referred for specialist care.\n\n'We are calling for new guidelines so healthcare professionals can confidently refer patients with possible severe asthma.\n\n'In the meantime, GPs should urgently refer patients who have had two or more courses of steroid tablets in the last year who could be eligible for life-saving treatment which could transform their lives.'", "description": "Scientists from\u00a0Amsterdam University looked at more than 2,300 people with the condition.
