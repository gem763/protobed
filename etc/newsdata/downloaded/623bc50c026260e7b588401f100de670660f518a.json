We fought with them for three and a half, four years. We never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks came as video of angry Kurds in the town of Qamishli pelted U.S. armored vehicles with vegetables and rocks as they exited the region, and residents held up signs that read: \u201cThanks for US People but Trump Betrayed Us.\u201d\n\nTonight in N.

As bipartisan outrage grew in Washington, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo flew to Ankara and struck what they called a \u201cceasefire\u201d deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan that called for the relocation of the Kurdish population living in northern Syria.\n\nTrump stressed Monday that he did not think that the United States was under any obligation to help protect the Kurds, who lost at least 10,000 fighters in the fight against ISIS. Eight U.S. service members were killed during the war.\n\nThe president did, however, see one reason to keep American troops in Syria.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary, other than that we secure the oil,\u201d Trump said.\n\nPresident Trump at a Cabinet meeting on Monday.

When you have $10 billion worth of airplanes shooting 10 miles in front of your line, it\u2019s much easier to fight,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut with that, they were a good help, but we were a great help to them too. They were fighting ISIS, you know they hated ISIS, so they were fighting ISIS. But we never agreed, where is an agreement that says we have to stay in the Middle East for the rest of humanity, for the rest of civilization to protect the Kurds? It never said that. And we have protected them. We\u2019ve taken very good care of them and I hope they\u2019re going to watch over ISIS.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to pull U.S. troops from Kurdish positions and allow Turkish forces to launch an attack was blasted by Democrats and Republicans alike, the president once again asserted that by allowing fighting to erupt, his administration was able to broker a deal to stop it.\n\n\u201cI will say this: If shooting didn\u2019t start for a couple of days, I don\u2019t think the Kurds would have moved, I don\u2019t think frankly you would have been able to make a very easy deal with Turkey,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think when it started for a few days it was so nasty that when we went to Turkey and when we went to the Kurds they agreed to do things that they never would have done before the shooting started.\u201d\n\nCritics of the president have noted that Trump\u2019s deal with Erdo\u011fan comes at the expense of the Kurds, who had been occupying a swath of northeastern Syria and now find themselves homeless. The House of Representatives voted 354\u201360 last week to condemn the pullout. In a Washington Post editorial, Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the withdrawal of U.S. troops \u201ca grave strategic mistake\u201d that \u201cwill leave the American people and homeland less safe, embolden our enemies, and weaken our important alliances.\u201d\n\nIn a speech last Thursday on the Senate floor, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, that \u201cwhat we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history.\u201d\n\nTrump, on the other hand, sees quite a different situation. \u201cOur relationship with the Kurds is good, and they\u2019re going to be safe,\u201d the president said Monday.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "President Trump told reporters Monday that the U.S. still has a \"good relationship with the Kurds.\"", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/K0OGvpzmyS3PHhf9mWThZA--~B/aD0zMjY0O3c9NDg5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/5e282b60-f42c-11e9-afbe-4856c99662a6", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
