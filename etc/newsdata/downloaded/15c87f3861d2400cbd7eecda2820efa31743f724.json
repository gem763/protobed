Moreover, the yield curve is inverted, and our policy rate remains above government bond yields for nearly every country in the G-7.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. economy grew at a 2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, down from 3.1 percent in the January-to-March period. Recession fears were stoked further in recent weeks when the spread between the U.S. 2-year and 10-year yields turned negative for the first time in over a decade.\n\nYields typically are larger for longer-term notes, since future conditions are more difficult to predict; a switch signals buyers are more worried about the economy in the present.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this month, the Institute for Supply Management said the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in August for the first time in three years. A separate report from the Fed showed manufacturing rebounded last month, but that the outlook remained weak.\n\nBullard also highlighted low inflation as a reason the Fed should have cut rates by 50 basis points instead of the smaller amount, which took rates to a range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent.\n\n\u201cCore and headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation measures continue to run some 40 to 60 basis points, respectively, below the FOMC's 2 percent inflation target,\u201d he said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nCore consumer prices rose 2.4 percent year-over-year, but the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures index, is running at about 1.6 percent.\n\nBullard's inflation argument is similar to the one made by President Trump, who has also called for bigger rate cuts.\n\n\"The USA should always be paying the lowest rate,\" the president tweeted on Sept. 11.\n\n\"No Inflation! It is only the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn\u2019t allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of 'Boneheads.'\"\n\nDespite his dissent, Bullard believes the Fed will take the necessary steps to support the economy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\"I remain confident that the committee will continue to monitor economic developments and respond accordingly as economic circumstances dictate,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to working with my colleagues to fulfill the FOMC\u2019s mandates.\u201d", "description": "St. Louis Fed President James Bullard wanted the Fed to cut rates by 50 basis points.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/bullard43-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
