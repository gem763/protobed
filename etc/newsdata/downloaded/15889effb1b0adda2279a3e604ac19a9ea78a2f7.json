Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who took on the role of public adversary to Cummings as they sat opposite each other on the Oversight Committee dais. Both were fierce partisan warriors, but developed a close personal friendship over the years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll probably be the hardest two or three minutes I will ever give,\u201d Meadows said of his speech on Thursday, noting that his office was down the hall from Cummings for years. \u201cHe was a real friend.\u201d\n\nCummings served as a champion for black Americans in Baltimore for decades. But lawmakers say he became the voice of black Americans across the nation in the era of President Donald Trump.\n\nCummings repeatedly decried Trump\u2019s rhetoric, even as he tried to forge policy deals with the president on issues like prescription drugs. He was forced into a more head-on conflict with Trump this summer, when the president called Baltimore a \u201crat and rodent infested mess\u201d in a tweet and called out Cummings specifically to \u201chelp clean up this very dangerous & filthy place.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe lost a giant, and we lost somebody at a particular moment of history when he was so needed,\u201d said Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, who will also speak at Thursday\u2019s ceremony.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows and Rep. Elijah Cummings. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\nAhead of the ceremony, top Democrats shared a video tribute of Cummings\u2019 political career with the CBC \u2014 which Cummings once chaired \u2014 where emotions ran high, according to people in the room. The caucus also plans to deliver its own tribute to him on Thursday on the House floor.\n\nCummings was an enormously respected figure, and though his health was poor during the past two years, he was a key figure in Democrats\u2019 sweeping investigations into the Trump administration since the president\u2019s inauguration in 2017. His oversight role took on greater urgency as Democrats formally moved into an impeachment inquiry this fall, and leaves behind a struggle to replace him as chairman.\n\nIn his final weeks, the Oversight chairman spoke on a near-daily basis to his fellow chairmen and staff about the ongoing investigation. Just days before he died, Cummings spoke on a conference call to brief the Democratic Caucus on the Ukraine investigation.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the IG is going to say, but whatever they say, it will be significant,\u201d Cummings told Democrats on a private caucus call on Oct. 2, as the caucus ramped up its probe into whether Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens.\n\nThe funeral on Friday, which will be held at his home church in Baltimore, is expected to draw thousands.\n\nIn Washington, Cummings will be the first lawmaker to lie in state since the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in August 2018. He will make history as just the third African American to receive the same honor, following Parks in 2013, and the first elected official to do so.\n\n\u201cIt shows the growth and development of the body politic in Washington,\u201d Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) said, adding that he became \u201cfast friends\u201d with Cummings even before he arrived in Congress more than a decade ago.\n\n\u201cHe was just a good human being,\u201d said Cleaver, a preacher-turned-congressman who will deliver the invocation and benediction at Thursday\u2019s ceremony. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if he is immediately replaceable.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1c/25/0263c4d54cd28a74d9ce4ee302b8/191023-cummings-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
