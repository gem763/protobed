In an e-mail in which she copied the people she accused, which The Witness has seen, she said her experience as a councillor in the organisation had \u201cbeen fraught with racism and abuse\u201d for three years.\n\n\u201cThe situation has worsened recently as after I\u2019ve returned from sick leave [cancer treatment] there has been a sustained campaign of abuse and harassment, interference in my ward to push me to resign as the cllr. This has always been the case but now it is worse,\u201d she said.\n\nIn her letter to Maimane, Singh, who accused a number of high ranking DA Msunduzi caucus councillors of racist conduct, requested the DA federal leader to intervene immediately.\n\n\u201cI have been bullied, intimidated and abused simply because I am not the \u2018right colour\u2019 and therefore, should not be leading a strong DA ward.\n\n\u201cMmusi this has been the case for 3 years and I ask your intervention failing which I will exercise my legal rights to stop the abuse, racism and dehumanising experience of being in this organisation,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Singh, she decided to write to Maimane after the DA provincial leadership had ignored her complaints.\n\nWhen The Witness contacted Singh she said: \u201cKindly note I cannot comment on an internal matter.\u201d\n\nDA provincial leader Zwakele Mncwango said the provincial leadership would investigate Singh\u2019s allegations, and denied that the DA KZN leadership had previously ignored the racism claims. \u201cI come to Msunduzi a lot and I meet with councillors so she could have even pulled me aside and spoken to me then but to be honest I haven\u2019t seen her for a while \u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just alarming. You can\u2019t tell me that you\u2019ve been experiencing this for three years but you\u2019ve never raised it.\u201d\n\nHe said it was a pity that in South Africa whenever a black person and white person had a dispute it became a race issue instead of a disagreement like any other.", "description": "The DA Msunduzi constituency has been rocked by accusations of abuse, racism and unfair practice \u2014 which the party\u2019s provincial leadership allegedly ignored.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9315/0d6bcff2f95845a0a8710ae10c7dd6ce.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
