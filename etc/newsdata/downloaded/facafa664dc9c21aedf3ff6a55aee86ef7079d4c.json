Criminal charges would only go ahead after a complaint by a spouse, child or parent.\n\nLiving together outside marriage could also lead to a six-month prison sentence.\n\nInsulting the president, vice president, religion, state institutions and symbols such as the flag and national anthem would also become criminal offences.\n\nAnd there would also be a maximum four-year prison term for women who have an abortion - if there were no circumstances of a medical emergency or rape.\n\nIf the code were to be passed, the law would take about two years to take affect so the public and police could become familiar with the changes.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption President Joko Widodo has been urged to stop the new set of laws passing\n\nBut there's been criticism over the government's plan.\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has said the new laws would \"violate the rights of women, religious minorities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, as well as freedom of speech and association\".\n\nThey also say new rules around abortion \"will set back women and girls' rights under international law to make their own choices\".\n\nA warning to tourists\n\nPoliticians in Indonesia say the new set of laws would demonstrate Indonesian independence and religiosity - because they replace colonial-era Dutch laws.\n\n\"The state must protect citizens from behaviour that is contrary to the supreme precepts of God,\" Nasir Djamil - a politician from the Prosperous Justice Party told Reuters.\n\nHe said leaders of all religions had been consulted on the changes because Indonesia's founding ideology was based on belief in God.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Visitors from all over the world travel to Bali\n\nThe Australian Government updated its travel advice for tourists heading to Indonesia, warning that they could soon be charged for offences.\n\n\"A large number of laws may change and these will also apply to foreign residents and visitors, including tourists,\" the Department of Foreign Affairs posted to its Smart Traveller website today, before the president announced this delay.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "Indonesia is rethinking controversial new laws - including a ban on sex outside marriage.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/157C8/production/_108880088_gettyimages-924325442.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
