In the first quarter, you hit them a couple times, you dent the shield a little bit. You keep on hitting it.\u201d\n\nPrescott\u2019s 8-yard scoring run for the final points broke Roger Staubach\u2019s club record of 20 rushing TDs by a quarterback and sent the Cowboys into their open week feeling good after a week of talk that coach Jason Garrett\u2019s job might be on the line.\n\nNext time out, they\u2019ll be going for a season sweep of the New York Giants and possibly a firmer hold on first in the NFC East.\n\n\u201cNo doubt in my mind about how we were going to come out and perform tonight,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t panic. We didn\u2019t have to say everything hit the fan, let\u2019s start over. We doubled down on who we are and just got better.\u201d\n\nCarson Wentz threw an interception and had two of Philadelphia\u2019s three lost fumbles. The Eagles (3-4) dropped their second straight game after a two-game winning streak that looked like it might get their season going.\n\n\u201cA little embarrassed,\u201d Wentz said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t show up.\u201d\n\nBrett Maher finished the highest-scoring half against Doug Pederson since he became coach of the Eagles in 2016, kicking a 63-yarder on the final play before halftime for a 27-7 lead.\n\nMaher is the first kicker in NFL history with three field goals of at least 60 yards \u2014 and all three have been at least 62. He kicked a 62-yarder last week against the New York Jets. Maher\u2019s other from 62 was against the Eagles last season, his first in the league.\n\nPederson had to clarify during the week that he wasn\u2019t guaranteeing a win after saying on his radio show that his team would go down to Dallas, win the game and fly home in first place.\n\nAnd the coach tried to reverse Philadelphia\u2019s trend of slow starts by taking the ball after winning the coin flip, just the second time in 33 winning flips that Pederson hasn\u2019t deferred in order to start the second half on offense.\n\nIt backfired when the Eagles fumbled on their first two possessions, leading to a pair of touchdowns after the Cowboys got the ball on the opponent\u2019s side of the 50 for the first two times this season.\n\nBefore that, Dallas was the only team in the NFL that hadn\u2019t started a drive on the favorable side of midfield.\n\n\u201cI feel like he got a statement today, and so we\u2019re going to let him go sleep on it,\u201d said defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence, whose sack of Wentz created the second turnover.\n\nDallas Goedert fumbled on a hit from Jaylon Smith at the end of an 8-yard catch on the opening possession, and Maliek Collins recovered at the Philadelphia 45. Five plays later, receiver Tavon Austin took an option pitch 20 yards for the score.\n\nAfter Wentz fumbled on the sack by Lawrence, and Antwaun Woods recovered, Elliott ran over Jenkins on the next play, then scored from the 1 after this initial TD was overturned.\n\n\u201cIt starts with me,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cThis is one of those games that I take personal from that standpoint. I\u2019ve got to get that fixed.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys answered the only touchdown from Eagles \u2014 Wentz\u2019s 28-yard pass to Goedert \u2014 when Prescott faked a handoff to Elliott from the 1 and threw to a wide-open Blake Jarwin in the end zone for a 21-7 lead.\n\nPrescott was 21 of 27 for 239 yards with a touchdown and an interception and had another 30 yards rushing. Amari Cooper caught five passes for 106 yards after missing most of a loss to the previously winless Jets with a thigh injury.\n\nWentz was 16 of 26 for 191 yards and the Cowboys held the Eagles to 283 yards after letting second-year Jets quarterback Sam Darnold have one of his best games as a pro last week.\n\nGROUND CONTROL\n\nDallas finished with 189 yards rushing, 116 more than the average that the league\u2019s No. 2 run defense was allowing.\n\nElliott, the last back to get 100 yards against the Eagles, did it again on 22 carries. The two-time NFL rushing champion is averaging 115 yards in five games against his division rival. It was his fourth 100-yard game of the season.\n\nINJURIES\n\nDallas linebacker Leighton Vander Esch didn\u2019t return after injuring his neck in the first half. He walked off the field after staying down for a few minutes. Cowboys defensive end Robert Quinn had a sack in the first half before leaving with a rib injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nEagles: At Buffalo next Sunday.\n\nCowboys: At the Giants on Monday, Nov. 4.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Ezekiel Elliott powered into the Philadelphia secondary and simply ran over safety Malcolm Jenkins.
