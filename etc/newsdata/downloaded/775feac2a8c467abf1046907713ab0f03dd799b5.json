Trump said he would make the announcement shortly.\n\n\u201cRick and I have been talking for six months. In fact, I thought he might go a bit sooner. But he\u2019s got some very big plans. He\u2019s going to be very successful. We have his successor, we\u2019ll announce it pretty soon,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump spoke fondly of Perry during the event, introducing the former Texas governor as a \"very good friend of mine,\" adding \"I'm going to miss you so much.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be announcing the replacement, and he \u2014 I think it\u2019s a he in this particular case \u2014 I think he\u2019ll do a fantastic job,\" Trump added. \"We worked on that together.

Trump is said to have named Perry as the impetus for the July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment probe.\n\n\"Not a lot of people know this but, I didn't even want to make the call. The only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to,\u201d Trump said earlier this month, according to Axios.\n\nThe timing of Perry\u2019s departure is sure to raise eyebrows, particularly as it comes amid growing scrutiny of Trump officials who were involved with Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats are pressing forward with witness testimonies as part of their impeachment probe. Multiple witnesses, including top State Department officials who ignored White House directives not to testify, have raised concerns about what they described as a shadow foreign policy conducted outside the normal diplomatic channels.\n\nPerry recently told Fox News he was not sure if he would comply with a congressional subpoena for records related to the Ukraine controversy. The deadline for submitting those documents is Friday.\n\n\"The House has sent a subpoena over for the records that we have, and our general counsel and the White House counsel are going through the process right now,\" Perry said earlier this month. \"I\u2019m going to follow the lead of my counsel on that.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThose remarks came after the White House wrote a letter to House leaders saying the executive branch would refuse to comply with the inquiry, but Perry\u2019s resignation could open the door to his eventual participation in the probe.\n\nReports that Perry would soon be departing the administration have persisted throughout his tenure.\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m here, I\u2019m serving,\" Perry said earlier this month at a news conference. \u201cThey\u2019ve been writing the story for at least nine months now. One of these days they will probably get it right, but it\u2019s not today, it\u2019s not tomorrow, it\u2019s not next month.\"\n\nPerry said it was energy issues that pushed him to broker a call between Trump and the Ukrainian president. In his role as Energy secretary, Perry has engaged in conversations with Naftogaz, Ukraine's state-owned oil and gas company.\n\nPerry, who ran for president in 2012 and 2016, is one of Trump\u2019s longest-serving Cabinet secretaries, having served 31 months in the administration.\n\nThe former Texas governor has kept a relatively low profile throughout his time in the administration, in contrast to the actions of his fellow energy and environment agency heads, two of whom resigned amid ethics concerns.\n\nPerry took heat early on in his post when in September 2017 he submitted an unprecedented proposal to prop up the struggling coal and nuclear industry. Federal regulators later killed the plan.\n\nHe was also criticized for a rule that rolled back Obama-era standards for lightbulbs, eliminating energy efficiency standards for nearly half the bulbs on the market.\n\nPerry was considered for other administration posts during Trump\u2019s presidency.
