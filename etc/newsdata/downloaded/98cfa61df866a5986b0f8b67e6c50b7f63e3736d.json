Many also have a drink while there.\n\nBig business\n\nThe UAE dominates other countries around the Middle East when it comes to drinking, with per capita alcohol consumption of 3.8 litres (1 gallon) per person per year, according to the World Health Organization. That is even with Sharjah, one of the UAE's seven emirates, banning alcohol.\n\nAlcohol means big business, especially for the state. There is a 50 percent import tax on a bottle of alcohol, as well as an additional 30 percent tax in Dubai on buying from liquor stores.\n\nDubai Duty Free, which is also government-owned, sold more than $2bn of goods last year alone to those passing through its airport terminals, including nine million cans of beer, three million whiskey bottles, and 1.5 million bottles of wine. Duty-free sales, while limited, never required an alcohol licence.\n\nThe country's two major liquor store chains are Maritime and Mercantile International, a subsidiary of the government-owned Emirates airline, and African & Eastern.\n\nBars and nightclubs in Dubai are almost entirely limited to operating inside of or connected to hotels - even drink receipts at the Dubai International Airport show up as coming from a hotel attached to the airport.\n\nBut even with those restrictions, alcohol-serving establishments always seem full on Thursday nights, the start of the Emirati weekend. Slowly, however, that has begun to change.\n\nEconomic downturn\n\nLower global energy prices, a 30 percent drop in Dubai's real estate market value and trade war fears have seen employers in the city-state shed jobs. Parking lots do not appear quite as full as they once were as sale signs plaster shop windows.\n\nThat downturn appears to have even extended to alcohol. Overall sales of alcohol dropped to 161.5 million litres (42.6 million gallons) in 2018, down from 163.7 million litres (43.2 million gallons) in 2017, according to Euromonitor.\n\nHowever, tourism helped keep retail prices high overall as some consumers also sought higher-priced liquors, it said.\n\n\"Travel and tourism will continue to play an important role in the development of alcoholic drinks in the United Arab Emirates, at least until Expo 2020,\" Euromonitor said, referring to Dubai's hosting of the world's fair next year. \"After Expo 2020, sales will be more influenced by in-country demographics and dynamics.\"\n\nThe hereditarily ruled government's Dubai Media Office and the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing did not respond to requests for comment on the new licence programme.\n\nHowever, thinking about tourists, authorities have taken steps in recent years to loosen drinking regulations.\n\nIn 2016, Dubai eased rules prohibiting daytime alcohol sales during the holy month of Ramadan, when observant Muslims fast from dawn to dusk and abstain from anything perceived as sinful behaviour.\n\nIn the next few years, the Islamic lunar calendar will draw Ramadan closer to early spring and winter months, a tourist-packed time in the city before the heat takes hold.\n\nNew law\n\nThe new procedure on alcohol permits allows tourists to obtain one for free at either African & Eastern or MMI stores after showing their passports and signing a pledge that they are not Muslim and will follow the local law.\n\nLocal newspaper stories involving alcohol and mayhem routinely included police charging tourists for drinking without a licence when they would not be able to legally register for one.\n\nMeanwhile, driving after consuming any amount of alcohol remains illegal as does drinking in public.\n\nRecently published guidelines say any alcohol purchased in stores can only be drunk \"within your hotel room/apartment\".\n\nA longtime critic of Dubai's legal system said the new laws can mislead tourists about glitzy Dubai's still-stringent laws on drinking.\n\n\"What the new law does is create potential revenue through the granting of licences, and further mislead people into thinking that they can buy and consume alcohol without any risks,\" said Radha Stirling of the for-hire advocacy group Detained in Dubai. \"But the same risks remain as before.\"", "description": "Economic downturn prompts new law that critics say can mislead tourists about Dubai's still-stringent laws on drinking.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/24/5fea19468c4d4f1893d59c0add53980a_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
