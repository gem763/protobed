REUTERS/Juan Carlos Ulate\n\nThe head of the University of Costa Rica\u2019s Insects Museum decided three years ago to replace animal protein in his diet with crickets, ants, cockroaches, beetles and other insects - and wants to encourage others to do the same.\n\n\u201cInsects are delicious,\u201d he said in an interview at his farm in Sarchi, about 30 miles (50 km) from the capital San Jose.\n\n\u201cYou can sit and watch a soap opera, watch the football game, do any activity with a plate full of insects. Eat them one by one, with a glass of soda... they\u2019ll go down well,\u201d said Paniagua.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has counted more than 1,900 insect species that are edible.\n\nEspecially in Asia and in Africa, the tiny creatures are touted as delicacies packed with vitamins, minerals and energy.\n\nTheir proponents also note that bugs emit fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia than cattle or pigs and require significantly less land and water than cattle.\n\nPaniagua\u2019s wife, Gabriela Soto, prepared their meal by splashing oil in a frying pan, adding the farm-raised insects and topping them off with a dash of salt.\n\nShe then brought out several dishes to her young daughter, who reached into a plate with her hands and munched fearlessly, and husband, who suggested a bit of lemon would enhance their flavour.\n\n\u201cThey are going to taste like potato chips... you can eat basically a whole plate of these insects,\u201d Paniagua said.", "description": "At his home in rural \u200bCosta Rica, biologist Federico Paniagua joined his family at the dining table to devour several types of insects that he raised on his farm and whose flavour he compares to potato chips.", "authors": ["Hector Guzman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1436051114&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF903O2", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
