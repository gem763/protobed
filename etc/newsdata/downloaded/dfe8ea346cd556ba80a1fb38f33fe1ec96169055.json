The bags are customisable with interchangeable skins that clip onto the bases.\n\nThe square Maia bag already has nine cover sets for customers to choose from, while Luna has seven. Some of those come in multiple parts, allowing owners to create a truly unique look by mixing and matching.\n\nThe Luna bag seen here has seven cover set options Umbro Kaixi\n\nEach bag and cover set is made from sustainably-sourced and eco-friendly materials, including a vegan alternative to leather.\n\n\"Four years ago, I walked into a department store and bought an expensive handbag in the colour of grey,\u201d explained the designer, who prefers to be known mononymously as Kaixi.\n\n\u201cA week later, I regretted my choice and decided to exchange it for a different colour, but it was too late.
