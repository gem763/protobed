The Dealmaster is back with another round of deals to share. Today's list is headlined by a modest but notable deal on the Nintendo Switch, as Target is throwing a $25 store gift card in with the purchase of the console at its standard $300 MSRP. The deal applies to the full-fat Switch, not the more portable Switch Lite, but it covers the latest model of the larger console, which has significantly improved battery life compared to the original system that launched in 2017. Similar $25 gift card bundles were available at Amazon and Best Buy earlier this month, but those have since expired.\n\nThis isn't a massive discount, and we wouldn't blame you if you held off until Black Friday before pulling the trigger on a new console. That can be said about almost everything tech-related, though, and straight discounts on the Switch have been relatively rare from major retailers. On Prime Day , for instance, Nintendo's main Switch deal kept the console at full price but bundled it with a $35 Nintendo eShop gift card. So if you were really eager to pick up the console today, and you plan to shop at Target again, there are worse offers out there.\n\nIf you're all good on the Switch front, though, we also have a truckload of deals on PS4 and Xbox One video games, $20 off one of our favorite portable Bluetooth speakers, discounts on Apple Watches and Roku TVs, and more. Have a look for yourself below.\n\nDealmaster: An Ars newsletter The Dealmaster is launching its very own newsletter!
