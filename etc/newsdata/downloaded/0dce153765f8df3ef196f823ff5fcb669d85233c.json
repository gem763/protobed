World leaders were cautiously optimistic, while the anti-Trump #resistance raged as usual.\n\nOn Sunday morning Trump revealed that the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) mastermind had met his demise the night before, detonating a suicide vest as American special forces entered his compound in northwestern Syria. The self-proclaimed caliph of a genocidal terrorist organization that once reigned over much of Iraq and Syria, Baghdadi\u2019s death was greeted with triumph by Trump, and cautious celebration from world leaders.\n\nAlso on rt.com How the operation to kill ISIS head al-Baghdadi unfolded (PHOTOS, VIDEOS)\n\n\"The death of Baghdadi is an important moment in our fight against terror, but the battle against the evil of Daesh is not yet over,\u201d said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, using a pejorative name for Baghdadi\u2019s organization. Likewise, French Defense Minister Florence Parly hailed the \u201cearly retirement for a terrorist, but not for his organisation.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu were equally congratulatory, with both vowing to assist the US in future counter-terrorist operations.\n\nAlso on rt.com Russian MoD doubts Trump\u2019s announcement of killing ISIS chief al-Baghdadi, rejects claims it assisted US forces in op\n\nRussian officials were more skeptical, with the chairman of the upper house of parliament's foreign affairs committee Konstantin Kosachyov cautioning that the death of Baghdadi had been incorrectly announced five times in the past, and warning that \u201ccountering terrorism is a much more difficult task than the physical destruction of its leaders.\u201d\n\nBack in Washington, partisan politics entered the fray. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) demanded that the House be briefed on the raid, and complained that \u201cthe Russians, but not top congressional leadership were notified.\u201d\n\n#BREAKING\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy #Pelosi issues stmt re: raid that led to the death of #ISIS leader #AbuBakralBaghdadi:\n\n\n\n\"The House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified of in advance.\"#alBaghdadi#Baghdadipic.twitter.com/z94ozzTHvl \u2014 Devon Heinen (@DevonHeinen) October 27, 2019\n\nRussian forces were warned of the raid so that the Americans could fly low through Syrian airspace they control, Trump claimed, although Moscow said there were no US coalition airstrikes in the Idlib area on Saturday and US aircraft were not flying.\n\nWhatever the case, American and Russian forces in Syria have maintained several \u201cdeconfliction\u201d lines of communication, and one might assume warning other armies in the area is the right thing to do to avoid inadvertent clashes.\n\nAs for Trump opting not to inform Pelosi and the Democrats, he said he wanted to avoid leaks to the media.\n\nThe attempt to turn this ISIS killing into the latest McCarthyite round of \"Trump-\ud83d\udc9e-Putin\" bullshit is even more pathetic than usual. Of course he told the Russians in advance: THEY NEEDED PERMISSION TO FLY OVER THEIR AIRSPACE along with other cooperation. \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa \u2014 Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 27, 2019\n\n\u201cThere's no country in the world that leaks like we do,\u201d he said, \u201cand Washington is a leaking machine.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the anti-Trump crowd hammered the president for \u201cindicating that he trusts Russia with this information more than congressional Democrats,\u201d as the Washington Post wrote. The Post also complained that Trump mentioned Russia in his speech before he mentioned the American intelligence community, as did the Twitter #resistance.\n\nIn addressing al-Baghdadi\u2019s suicide bombing, Trump thanked Russia before US Special forces & fetishized the \u201cwhimpering, crying, screaming\u201d that preceded his death. Basically a foreign agent pep rally hosted by a small boy allowed to play MA-rated video games for the first time. \u2014 Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) October 27, 2019\n\nfirst country Trump thanked: Russia \u2014 John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) October 27, 2019\n\nThis mission is a good thing ... but Trump\u2019s obsession with Russia, repeated praising them as critical to the raid is disturbing on a level I\u2019ve never imagined. What has Moscow got on Trump? It\u2019s insane how slavishly he seeks to reward Putin but block Congress. #alBaghdadihttps://t.co/cZAVuLCOgX \u2014 Malcolm Nance (@MalcolmNance) October 27, 2019\n\nAmong other bones picked by the #resistance was Trump\u2019s insistence that Baghdadi\u2019s death was a bigger moment than the death of Osama Bin Laden in 2011, under Barack Obama\u2019s leadership.\n\nTrump claiming killing Baghdadi was \"bigger\" than killing Bin Laden shows how petty and vile Trump is. He will use any moment he can to tell his base that he's better than the dreaded black President they all hated. \u2014 (((DeanObeidallah))) (@DeanObeidallah) October 27, 2019\n\nTrump boasting that killing Baghdadi was a much bigger accomplishment than killing Osama Bin Laden just shows how Trump has so much jealousy and contempt for our nation\u2019s first black President, whom he will never measure up to in a million years. \u2014 Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) October 27, 2019\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a guy that is more incapable of just taking a win. He will never understand that sometimes less is more. \u2014 Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) October 27, 2019\n\nCNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, meanwhile, blasted Trump for delaying the start of his news conference by 20 minutes, while Obama started his on time. Par for the course for CNN.\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s death will be mourned by few in America, yet some disagreed with Trump\u2019s graphic depiction of the jihad chief\u2019s final moments, which he said were spent \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming.\u201d According to some, the IS leader, who oversaw genocide, execution, rape and forced religious conversion, deserved a little more respect.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018He died like a dog, like a coward!\u2019 Trump describes GRAPHIC death of ISIS leader al-Baghdadi\n\nJames Winnefeld, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Obama, told CBS that Trump \u201cpiling humiliation\u201d on Baghdadi after his death was inappropriate.\n\n\"If you look back at the Bin Laden raid, we treated his body with respect that is due under Islam,\" Winnefeld continued, referring to the unceremonious burial at sea given to the 9/11 mastermind following his death at the hands of a Navy SEAL team.\n\n\u201cI think this is what Dems will settle on,\u201d journalist Glenn Greenwald wrote. \u201cObama's boasting of killing Bin Laden was done with elegance, class and dignity, while Trump's was tacky, crass and unpresidential. What else do they have? It's kind of a metaphor for the general contempt for Trump.\u201d\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
