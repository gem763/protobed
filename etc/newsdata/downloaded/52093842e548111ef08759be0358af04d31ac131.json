He forced himself [on me]... He left after I said I will call the police,\" she said in the interview.\n\nThe woman also showed apparent bruises on her arms, hands and feet.\n\nMahara's aide Dilli Malla denied the allegations in a statement issued on Tuesday morning, saying it was \"an attempt to assassinate the character of the speaker\".\n\nMahara, a former Maoist rebel, was elected speaker after an alliance of the rebels and moderate communists registered a landslide victory in the 2017 elections.\n\n190619121216425\n\nHe was the chief rebel negotiator during the peace talks with the government that ended a decade-long civil war in 2006.\n\nThe ruling Communist Party asked Mahara to step down in light of the allegations and to help a fair investigation, party spokesman Narayan Kaji Shrestha said by telephone, amid a barrage of criticism of Mahara on social media.\n\nActivists say more women are speaking up about cases of sexual violence, but also that many still go unreported in deeply patriarchal Nepal.\n\n\"We will stay watchful. Impartial investigation is must. Position, reach, victim shaming will not be valued,\" tweeted woman's rights activist Hima Bista.", "description": "Woman accuses Krishna Bahadur Mahara of assaulting her while drunk at her apartment in capital Kathmandu on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/b772b0573fe4440ab541a820165e14f3_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
