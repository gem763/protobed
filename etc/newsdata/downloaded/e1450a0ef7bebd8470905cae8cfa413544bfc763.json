NBC said it booted Lauer for \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.\u201d\n\nNevils said she stayed anonymous for personal safety and fear of professional repercussions, but decided to reveal her identity and her story of the encounter \u2015 describing it publicly for the first time as rape \u2015 to Farrow. Excerpts of the book were published by Variety on Tuesday night.\n\nLauer responded Wednesday in a 1,400-word open letter published by Variety. He denied Nevils\u2019 rape claim, attacked her and several other women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, and sought to portray himself as the victim.\n\nLauer accused Nevils, with whom he had an extramarital affair, of fabricating details \u201cintended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter.\u201d He claimed she was trying to promote herself, \u201cstepping into the spotlight to cause as much damage as she can,\u201d and said she and his other accusers \u201chave done enormous damage.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor two years, the women with whom I had extramarital relationships have abandoned shared responsibility, and instead, shielded themselves from blame behind false allegations,\u201d Lauer wrote. \u201cThey have avoided having to look a boyfriend, husband, or a child in the eye and say, \u2018I cheated.\u2019 They have done enormous damage in the process. And I will no longer provide them the shelter of my silence.\u201d\n\nLauer\u2019s letter repeatedly questioned Nevils\u2019 story, pointing out that they had consensual sexual interactions after the alleged rape. Nevils acknowledged that sexual relationship to Farrow. Sexual assault survivors often stay with their abusers and continue to have consensual sexual relationships with them, typically because of the unequal power dynamic.\n\n\u201cThis is what I blame myself most for,\u201d Nevils told Farrow, according to the book excerpts. \u201cIt was completely transactional. It was not a relationship.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet Wednesday, Nevils thanked other sexual assault survivors for supporting her.\n\nI want to thank the many survivors who shared their stories with me today and offered their support. It takes courage, and I am truly grateful. \u2014 Brooke Nevils (@BrookeNevils) October 9, 2019\n\nAmong those backing her was former \u201cToday\u201d host Ann Curry, who has said she warned NBC leadership of Lauer\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct in 2012.\n\nCurry, a longtime NBC host, became \u201cToday\u201d co-anchor in 2011, but was pushed out a year later. She reportedly did not get along with Lauer and complained that the show had a \u201cboys\u2019 club atmosphere.\u201d\n\nBrooke Nevils is a credible young woman of good character. She came to NBC News an eager and guileless 20-something, brimming with talent.\n\n\n\nI believe she is telling the truth. And that breaks my heart. https://t.co/k4LT3MEh5Q \u2014 Ann Curry (@AnnCurry) October 9, 2019\n\nFarrow\u2019s book also says NBC leadership looked the other way in response to reports of Lauer\u2019s abuse, and tried to derail Farrow\u2019s reporting on Harvey Weinstein, eventually published in The New Yorker.", "description": "Nevils' complaint that Lauer raped her in 2014 led to his firing as host of NBC's \"Today\" show.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9f22952100005009acc3d8.jpeg?cache=bj1jftrac2&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
