I don\u2019t know where that came from,\u201d Larry Kudlow told reporters.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at, actually, is investor protection, U.S. investor protections ... transparency and compliance with a number of laws,\u201d he said, citing complaints from exchanges.\n\nHe added that the administration had convened a \u201cstudy group\u201d to examine those issues, but said it was \u201cvery early\u201d in its deliberations.\n\nKudlow\u2019s remarks come days before top U.S. officials will welcome a senior Chinese delegation for another round of trade talks. The White House confirmed on Monday the talks would begin Thursday.\n\nShares in several U.S.-listed Chinese companies rose following Kudlow\u2019s comments, with Hangzhou, Zhejiang-based Alibaba (BABA.N) up 1.55% and JD.com (JD.O) and Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) up 0.41% and 0.63%, respectively.\n\nHis remarks came several days after reports the administration was considering delisting Chinese companies. Sources said such a move, ratcheting up trade tensions between the world\u2019s two leading economies, would be part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in Chinese firms.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's chief economic adviser on Monday said the administration had begun studying U.S. investor protections in China, but that delisting Chinese companies traded on U.S. exchanges \"is not on the table.\"", "authors": ["Pete Schroeder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438176014&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF96117", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
