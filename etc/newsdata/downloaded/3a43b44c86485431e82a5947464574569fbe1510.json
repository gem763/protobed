In just over a month after this partnership started, the platform saw a 67% increase in monthly active users, claiming that its audience had accounted for more than 5 million viewers and over 70,000 streamers at the time.\n\nAmong other things, in their bid to \u201ctake on YouTube and Twitch with a decentralized, collectively-owned video content distribution system,\u201d Theta Network and DLive aim to cut \u201cfast-rising content delivery costs\u201d by at least 50% thanks to their new partnership. Wilson Wei, CEO of DLive\u2019s parent company Lino, noted:\n\n\u201cThe DLive platform has grown tremendously in 2019, but with that comes fast-rising content delivery costs. By adding Theta Network to our video infrastructure we can reduce those costs by 50% or more, making DLive platform growth more sustainable and at the same time adding a new way to engage our users with token rewards.\u201d\n\nStreaming decentralized\n\nPer the announcement, the firms\u2019 first joint step will be to incorporate Theta\u2019s peer-to-peer streaming protocol into DLive\u2019s video platform on both desktop and mobile devices, allowing DLive users to relay video on the Theta Network and earn token rewards.\n\nIn the future, the firms also plan to deepen their collaboration, including possible \u201ccontent syndication\u201d between SLIVER.tv and DLive, and cross-promotion.\n\nRecently, Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch removed Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as payment options for subscriptions.\n\nIn April, crypto indices provider AltDex has launched a crypto index for gaming-related tokens that is designed to track cryptocurrencies and tokens of blockchain-based projects related to video games, esports and other analogous decentralized applications.", "description": "Theta Labs announces that its blockchain video infrastructure protocol Theta Network will soon be incorporated into decentralized streaming platform DLive", "authors": ["Liam Frost"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy83MjJkOWI1OWUyMDVmYmM5NzNmYzIyODdiOTIwM2QwNC5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
