Roy Cooper (D) said in a news conference that House Republicans called for a \u201csurprise vote\u201d while he and House members were honoring first responders on the anniversary of 9/11.\n\n\u201cRepublicans called a deceptive surprise override of my budget veto,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s the people of North Carolina who lose.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Darren Jackson (D) said he told his caucus members that they did not need to be in attendance and that state Rep. David Lewis (R), chairman of the Rules, Calendar and Operations Committee, gave Jackson his word that there would be no votes, according to the News & Observer.\n\nRepublican leaders denied giving any such assurance. The Associated Press reported that the office of Republican Speaker Tim Moore provided audio from Tuesday\u2019s floor session of Lewis saying that recorded votes would happen Wednesday.\n\nRepublicans also disputed the claim by the governor and other Democrats that many of them were attending events remembering 9/11 victims and first responders. Local news reports said only one or two Democrats claimed to have been attending a 9/11 memorial at the time of the vote.\n\nRepublicans were unable to override the veto for about two months as long as Democrats were present in the chamber, Cooper said. The General Assembly needs a three-fifths majority to override a veto, which Republicans lack.\n\nThe House is allowed to conduct business as long as at least 61 of 120 members are present. There were 64 members present Wednesday morning.\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Gov.

Jason Saine (R) made the motion to review the budget shortly before 9 a.m., according to the News & Observer, and Moore dismissed objections from the Democrats present.\n\nThe vote went ahead with the members present. The result was a veto override, 55 to 9.\n\nDemocrats in the chamber cried foul, and Jackson later said he wants Lewis to recall the veto before it reaches the Senate.\n\n\u201cThis is a tragedy. This is a travesty of the process, and you know it,\u201d Rep. Deb Butler (D) yelled before the vote began. \u201cMr. Speaker, how dare you, Mr. Speaker!\u201d\n\nState Rep. Mary Belk (D) said at a news conference that Moore \u201ckept talking over us. He turned off our mics,\u201d the AP reported.\n\nIn a tweet shortly after the vote, Democratic state Sen. Jeff Jackson called Republicans\u2019 behavior \u201cplainly unethical.\u201d\n\nBREAKING: After telling Democrats there were no votes, House Republicans just called a *surprise vote* and overrode the Governor\u2019s veto on the budget, 55-9 (with almost half of members absent).\n\n\n\nVeto still stands in the Senate.\n\n\n\nPlainly unethical behavior by Republicans today. \u2014 Sen. Jeff Jackson (@JeffJacksonNC) September 11, 2019\n\nAs Moore threatened to have Butler removed from the chamber, her Democratic colleagues surrounded her to prevent her arrest, according to video of the confrontation. Butler told Moore he would have to answer to the people of North Carolina.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great day for North Carolina,\u201d Moore told the local TV outlet CBS 17.\n\nClarification: An earlier version of this article overly generalized the reason for Democrats\u2019 absence from the General Assembly session.
