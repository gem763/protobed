He also gained more Twitter followers over the course of the debate than any other candidate.\n\nWhile some rivals on the debate stage laughed and rolled their eyes at the ploy, Yang\u2019s campaign sees the \u201cFreedom Dividend Pilot Program\u201d as an example of why their internet-first campaign has pushed them to sixth place in the crowded contest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a 21st century candidate and we\u2019re running a 21st century campaign,\u201d Campaign Manager Zach Graumann said. \u201cThat\u2019s something not many of our competitors can say.\u201d\n\nThe $1 million in post-debate fundraising is over a third of the $2.8 million Yang raised in the last quarter, suggesting the 44-year-old entrepreneur is on track to raise significantly more in the third quarter that ends this month.\n\nYang framed the cash giveaway, which ends at 11:59pm ET Thursday night, in populist terms \u2014 that it was better to spend the campaign money giving it back to the people rather than spend it on TV ads and political consultants.\n\n\u201cWhen you donate money to a presidential campaign, what happens?\u201d Yang asked in his opening statement at Thursday night\u2019s debate. \u201cThe politician spends the money on TV ads and consultants and you hope it works out. It\u2019s time to trust ourselves more than our politicians.\u201d\n\nThe campaign\u2019s online raffle has met with deep skepticism from campaign finance experts, but they acknowledge that the Federal Election Commission is unlikely to stop him given that it currently does not have a quorum.\n\n\u201cThis campaign stunt is of dubious legality, at best,\u201d said Brendan Fischer, the federal reform legal director at the Campaign Legal Center. \u201cHanding campaign funds to supporters comes awfully close to violating the personal use prohibition. But Yang seems to be going ahead because he knows that the paralyzed FEC can\u2019t tell him \u2018no.\u2019\u201d\n\n\"The campaign tactic raises numerous novel legal questions,\" said Paul Ryan, Vice President of Policy and Litigation at Common Cause. \"If only we had a quorum at the FEC, so the Commission could provide guidance on this cutting-edge, novel use of campaign funds!\"\n\nThe Yang campaign said they \u201cconsulted extensively with our counsel\u201d before last Thursday\u2019s announcement. \u201cThese expenditures are made to further the goals of the campaign by demonstrating the transformative power of Andrew's flagship proposal,\u201d the campaign said in a statement. \u201cSince these payments would not be made irrespective of the campaign, they comply with all campaign finance laws.\u201d\n\nYang also responded to legality questions on Sunday to CNN. \u201cIf I gave a million dollars to media company or consultants or hired like a small army of canvassers no one would blink an eye, but if we give the money directly to the American people somehow that's problematic,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it just speaks to how messed up our system is where giving money directly to Americans actually raises eyebrows.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The campaign says it raised $1 million in the 72 hours since the giveaway became public.", "authors": ["Alex Thompson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QmyHS17c5wD4ppWCxeg_Jw--~B/aD0xOTgzO3c9Mjk3NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/2f08daf0-d609-11e9-9b7f-c3d255f62a27", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
