They would also increase the approval threshold for the level of shareholder support needed to force change at a company. The rules will be subject to a month-long period of public comment before a final vote. (Financial Times)\n\nTalking point: This is the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s second major move this year to rein in the power of proxy advisers. In August, it published a report clarifying that the firms are subject to anti-fraud legislation on materially false or misleading statements. Proxy-advising firms give shareholders advice on how to vote on various corporate issues from gender equity to executive compensation. Asset managers, overloaded with information from having to consider a high number of votes, commonly outsource this part of their jobs, and a study of 175 asset managers suggests they abide by the recommendations of their proxy advisers 95 per cent of the time. In the U.S., 97 per cent of the proxy-advising industry is dominated by two major firms: Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis. Critics say they have outsized power in capital markets to the point where they now serve as quasi-regulators operating without statutory oversight.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
