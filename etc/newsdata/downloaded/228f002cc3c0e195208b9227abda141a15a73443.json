'I'd much rather play someone who's got as much to lose as I have.\n\n'When you're playing people who are just happy to be there, it's their big occasion and they just go out and smash the balls all over the place, there's no point trying to play the right shot.\n\n'Every time you do, they just play the wrong shot. Whatever game plan you've got, they just totally throw it out of the window with one shot.\n\nO'Sullivan joked with reporters that he wouldn't be spending his days off in West Sussex town\n\n'It's like following a driver who doesn't really know what they're doing. You're just trying to second-guess it and you end up having a crash yourself.'\n\nAt last year's English Open, the first to be held at the new venue in Crawley, O'Sullivan was scathing of the facilities and the fact that the public were still using the swimming pool and other areas. It appears he is still of the same opinion.\n\n'It's not changed as far as I'm concerned,' he added. 'You would have to change a lot in this place, a complete refurbishment probably.\n\n'I'm not surprised, it's what I expect it to be.\n\n'I've just gone from a match table, to a squash court to a toilet, where the players' office is, from the toilet to walk around the outside of the building through the heavy rain to come here and talk to you.\n\n'I'll probably end up with a bit of pneumonia on top of the cold I've already got.'\n\nO'Sullivan also hit out at his lowly round one opponent and said he'd rather face a top player\n\nWorld Snooker have since hit back, though, telling the BBC that they received excellent feedback from players, spectators and officials last year - also confirming that they had tried to make layout changes this time around.\n\nThe team behind the event have attempted to improve the player experience with a new quiet lounge and improved practice facilities, they claim.\n\n'We are happy to be working with the K2 venue building the English Open into a great event,' a spokesperson said.\n\n'The atmosphere in the arena on the opening day on Monday was excellent and we look forward to more support from the people of Crawley throughout the week.'", "description": "O'Sullivan won the 2017 edition of the tournament in Barnsley, but didn't have anything nice to say last year as he crashed out at the semi-final stage.
