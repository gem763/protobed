Many have day jobs. The Swedish representative teaches at a business school. The one in Israel is a rabbi. They\u2019re typically well-educated Venezuelans who can afford to live in far-flung countries.\n\n\u201cSo far we have been working as volunteers,\u201d she said. \u201cI pay for everything myself. There is no budget.\u201d\n\nThe envoys\u2019 status depends on the context. Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s emissary In Washington, Carlos Vecchio, is recognized as ambassador and \u2014 following a standoff \u2014 now has possession of the embassy. Ms. Zubillaga is \u201cMadame Ambassador\u201d among the Lima Group of Latin American nations and Canada. But the French government calls her a \u201cspecial envoy\u201d because \u2014 despite recognizing Mr. Guaid\u00f3 as president \u2014 they consider Mr. Maduro\u2019s appointee to be the ambassador. (This lets France \u201cdialogue with all the actors of this crisis\u201d to press for a peaceful transition and get humanitarian aid into the country, a diplomatic source said.)\n\nMany of Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s diplomats are exiles themselves. Ms. Zubillaga fled Venezuela in 2014 after she and her family were subject to a violent home invasion and the country\u2019s second-in-command, Diosdado Cabello, called her a terrorist on TV. Mr. Cabello is accused by the United States of drug trafficking and of running a vast network through which he embezzles and launders state funds.\n\n\u201cWe had friends who were in jail, who were killed,\u201d she told me. \u201cI woke the kids at 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, it was still dark, and I said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to school today, we\u2019re going to New York.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey later moved to Madrid, where Ms. Zubillaga had a part-time job with an organic olive oil company, and eventually got a Spanish passport. At night she worked for the Venezuelan opposition, speaking to families of political prisoners. She added that the now-vast Venezuelan diaspora \u2014 the number of Venezuelans in Spain alone has doubled to 320,000 in the past four years \u2014 gives crucial support, too.\n\nSince Ms. Zubillaga was familiar with France \u2014 she has a master\u2019s degree from the Sorbonne \u2014 she began representing the opposition here. She points to diplomatic progress: As an opposition representative in 2014, she entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs though the back door. In 2018, she was part of a delegation received publicly by President Emmanuel Macron. Now as \u201cspecial envoy\u201d she meets regularly with members of Mr. Macron\u2019s foreign policy team.", "description": "Isadora Zubillaga is leading a valiant effort to represent her country \u2014 not its dictator \u2014 overseas.", "authors": ["Pamela Druckerman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/opinion/10Druckerman1/10Druckerman1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
