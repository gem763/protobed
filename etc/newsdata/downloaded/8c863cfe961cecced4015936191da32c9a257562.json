They weren't there when I went to bed.\n\n'Steven wasn't affected as he slept on top of the duvet, whereas I was between the mattress and the duvet.'\n\nLisa complained at reception but says she was told complaints had to be made online, adding that another member of staff promised to investigate, conceding they'd 'not had problems like this for a long time'.\n\nConcerned she might take any creepy crawly stowaways with her, Lisa binned their overnight suitcase and \u00a3150-worth of clothing, continuing on to the couple's planned trip to Poland with two cases she had left in the car.\n\nThe couple stopped at a pharmacy but, Lisa said: 'The holiday was marred as the spots got worse and the antihistamines hadn't started working properly.\n\n'They would come up into a white puss-like spot and they would just burst, they were weeping quite a lot by then.\n\nThe sores sores became pus-filled and infected, but Premier Inn denies there were bed bugs\n\nMrs Adams said she would not be returning to any branch of Premier Inn following the incident\n\n'I had to wear longer trousers to try and cover my legs because I didn't want to get any dirt or anything in them.\n\n'I wasn't able to go out and wear my shorts and sit out in the sun as much as I would normally, I didn't want people looking at them either.'\n\nBack home, Lisa is still suffering with what's believed to be a lingering infection of the bites - causing itching all over the body and the sensation that her blood is 'boiling'.\n\nLisa said: 'By the time we got back they still hadn't cleared up so I went to another pharmacist where I was given a stronger course of antihistamine and cream.\n\n'Last week I went to the doctor who said the bites look infected, which is why they weren't clearing up properly.\n\n'There was a fairly red, swollen patch on the bottom of my right leg, which is where one of the bigger bites was.\n\n'All over my body was itching. I was constantly scratching, even in places where there were no bites, and it felt like my blood was boiling inside me.\n\n'I was given another course of antihistamines, a week's worth of antibiotics and a massive tub of cream to ease the itching.\n\nLisa Adams and husband Steven Adams booked an overnight stay at the hotel in Priory Marina, Bedford, during a trip to visit their grandchildren in Bury St Edmunds last month\n\n'The doctor said that from what I've described, it's definitely something in the bed or the upholstery - possibly bed bugs or dust mites.'\n\nLisa, who regularly used Premier Inn for the last ten years, said she'll never step foot in one again after the way she's been treated.\n\nLisa said: 'The way they've handled the complain is appalling.\n\n'Given the severity of the bites it needed to be highlighted. If that had been an older person they may not be robust enough to fight the infection as I have, it could have been worse.\n\n'To be fobbed off the way I was is just not right, I won't be staying with Premier Inn again after this.'\n\nA Premier Inn spokesman said: 'To ensure that we are proactive in matters of this nature, our housekeeping and maintenance teams are fully trained to spot the signs of bed bugs.\n\n'In this instance, upon receiving the complaint our specially-trained team members examined the room and their stringent checks revealed no evidence of bed bugs.\n\n'Nonetheless, in the interests of caution, the team have since engaged with external specialists to launch their own inspection of the guest's room and they have independently confirmed that there is absolutely no evidence of bed bugs in the room Mrs Adams' was allocated.'", "description": "Lisa Adams, 43, from Cornwall, (pictured with husband Steven) stayed in a Premier Inn in Bedford in September.
