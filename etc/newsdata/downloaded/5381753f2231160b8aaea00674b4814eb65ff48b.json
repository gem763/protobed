Neither the Conservative Party nor the New Democratic Party nor the Green Party had any leader in the hopper who seemed able to compete with the Kennedy-esque Mr. Trudeau, who scored photo shoots in Vogue and his own comic book cover. He should have been untouchable for an election or two, at least.\n\nAnd yet on Monday, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government was reduced to a minority. His party lost the popular vote to the Conservatives. Canada\u2019s electoral map is now disturbingly divided between the Liberal-dominated east of the country, and the Conservative-dominated west. Mr. Trudeau will likely depend on the support of the other parties to keep his hold on power.\n\nWhat happened to Canada\u2019s progressive idol? The short answer is that Mr. Trudeau came to power when Canadian politics was dominated by issues like deficit spending, electoral reform and whether a local Conservative candidate peed in a cup on television. At the time, he presented a happy contrast to incumbent Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who seemed stodgy, cynical and petty by comparison. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s campaign promised \u201csunny ways\u201d and at a time when the future looked rosy for Canada, voters responded warmly to the change of tone.\n\nBut the world has grown much scarier and more uncertain since the 2015 election. And Mr. Trudeau has done little to convince voters that he is the right man to manage it.", "description": "Sure, he eked out a \u201cwin.\u201d But it shouldn\u2019t have even been a fight.", "authors": ["Jen Gerson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/opinion/22Gerson/22Gerson-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
