What\u2019s more, it needed no intervention from your end.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Project Zero team, which uncovered the bug on September 28, said it only affects audio calls, as the video option needs to be manually enabled for all incoming calls.\n\nSignal has since patched the problem in its latest update of the app (version 4.47.7).\n\n\u201cUsing a modified client, it is possible to send the \u2018connect\u2019 message to a callee device when an incoming call is in progress, but has not yet been accepted by the user. This causes the call to be answered, even though the user has not interacted with the device,\u201d Project Zero\u2019s Natalie Silvanovich noted.\n\nThe eavesdropping flaw would have been an issue on the iOS version of Signal too, if it wasn\u2019t for an error in the user interface that prevented the call from being completed. As it stands, the flaw can\u2019t be exploited on iOS.\n\nThe bug is also a lot similar to a major FaceTime flaw that was uncovered this year, which allowed a remote attacker to hear other person\u2019s voice even before they answered your call.\n\nIf you are a Signal user, you should waste no time updating the app.\n\nRead next: Instagram might soon let you post group stories", "description": "Signal fixes flaw in its Android app that could potentially allow a bad actor to force a call to be answered at the receiver's end without requiring the callee's interaction.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F02%2FSignal.jpg&signature=65ff9c72c471ad5f7bb869846a1b2b37", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
