He later declined to call it a guarantee.\n\n\u201cNever said guarantee a win. I\u2019d never do that,\u201d he said at his news conference.\n\nPederson also said he has no regrets about saying it.\n\n\u201cNo, because again, that shows confidence in our football team and I promise you (Cowboys coach) Jason Garrett is going to say the same thing with his team that they are going to win the football game, as well,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stand up here and go on record and say: \u2018We\u2019re going to go down there and try to win a game. Man, hopefully we can go win this one.\u2019 It just doesn\u2019t show confidence and I want to show confidence in our players. We have a ton of confidence in them. We are going to put a good week of preparation in and go play.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThrowing the ball to rookie running back Miles Sanders has been the only way for the offense to get big gains since wide receiver DeSean Jackson was injured in Week 2. Sanders had a 32-yard TD catch and a 45-yard reception that set up a score against Minnesota. He already has five catches of 30-plus yards and is third on the team with 219 yards receiving.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe secondary is struggling. Rasul Douglas was beat by Stefon Diggs on touchdown passes of 62 and 51 yards. Diggs blew past Douglas on one and safety Malcolm Jenkins blew his assignment to help on the other. Sidney Jones had costly penalties and poor coverage. The Eagles are missing starters Ronald Darby, Jalen Mills and Avonte Maddox and key backup Cre\u2019Von LeBlanc. Darby and Mills might return this week, though Mills hasn\u2019t played since last October.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nRookie left tackle Andre Dillard played 72% of the snaps after Jason Peters was injured and had some ups and downs against three-time Pro Bowl end Everson Griffen.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nWide receiver Mack Hollins has played 109 snaps over the past three games and has only one catch on five targets. He dropped what should\u2019ve been a 21-yard TD pass in the second quarter against the Vikings. Kicker Jake Elliott threw an interception on a fake field goal on the next play.\n\nINJURED\n\nPeters (knee) and linebacker Nigel Bradham (ankle) left the game in Minnesota and Pederson said both are getting second opinions on their injuries. Pederson added both are day-to-day.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n4 - The Eagles only had four hits on Cousins and one sack, giving him plenty of time to sit back and pick apart the undermanned secondary. Getting pressure on the quarterback has been a problem for the defense all season - except for 10 sacks against the Jets and Luke Falk last week. They have four sacks in the five other games.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Eagles visit Dallas. The Cowboys swept the series last year and have won nine of 14.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The best thing that happened for the Philadelphia Eagles over the weekend took place in a different game between two other teams.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Maaddi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/eagles_vikings_football_18481_c0-127-3047-1904_s1200x700.jpg?27db2c39d0366eacb5f150fbc9b565b91081bb68", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
