It turns out that they\u2019ve been awarded a patent via researcher Salvatore Cezar Pais at the Naval Air Warfare Center for a rather unbelievable new piece of technology. It\u2019s a fusion reactor (as opposed to a fission reactor like the ones we use now) that could fit in a small space and produce unbelievable amounts of power. And that\u2019s already got some people wondering if they reverse-engineered it from a UFO. (Mysterious Universe)\n\nThe U.S. Navy has been in the news for some weird stuff over the last few years. As the only branch of the military which has acknowledged the UFO (or UAP as they insist on referring to it) phenomenon, it\u2019s quite curious that they have recently filed patents for technology that seems a perfect fit if they were attempting to build their own flying saucers. The problem is that a lot of these patents describe things that just simply shouldn\u2019t exist within our known technological capacities. The latest in a series of filed U.S. Navy patents that seem to be beyond the realm of modern physics is a compact nuclear fusion reactor that could potentially fit inside a small craft. Yet nuclear fusion is a \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of energy production which we supposedly can\u2019t figure out how to do at all, let alone create a compact fusion reactor that could fit inside a small vehicle. Mysterious Universe alumnus Brett Tingley and Tyler Rogoway at The War Zone did a fantastic deep dive into this mysterious Navy patent and why it\u2019s so confusing.\n\nYou can view the patent here.\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out that you can receive a patent for a theory about something without having actually built a working model yet. This may apply to several patents that the Navy was granted for Mr. Pais, including a room-temperature superconductor and a speed of light propulsion system. None of this should be possible under our current level of technology\u2026 that we know of.\n\nAs for this reactor, Popular Mechanics took a look at the patent recently (it was actually published a few weeks ago) and cast serious doubt on whether or not anyone can build one. A working fusion reactor would be a massive game-changer for the future of humanity, but we don\u2019t seem to be even close to being able to create a functional one. The ones being constructed by researchers have all sorts of issues. They only fire up for a matter of seconds, tend to be the size of large buildings, and have no practical way to capture the energy they create. Even if they did, they take more energy to operate than they produce.\n\nIf the Navy has cooked one up that actually works and could fit in a plane they\u2019ve made a quantum leap ahead of everyone else. Unless, of course, somebody else built it and they\u2019re just figuring out how to copy the technology. And that brings us back to those pesky aliens again\u2026", "description": "Hey, why not?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/UFO.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
