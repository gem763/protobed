He had previously told members of Cyrus' team, \"It's my life's mission to impregnate Miley,\" according to law enforcement sources.\n\nUpon his arrest, Rumsey proceeded to tweet several alarming messages to the singer, saying he didn't want to go back to his hotel room alone and that he's banned from MGM Hotels \"from when you took my soul.\" Historically, he's tweeted at Cyrus dozens of times, telling her he's capable of bringing back the dead and that he knows her song lyrics are intended for him.\n\nIn one note from earlier this year, Rumsey alluded to a prior brush with the police, tweeting, \"I was escorted by cops to train and told if I come back to California to try to meet you I will either be in jail or hospital. I'm in Washington state hope you can come sometime this summer. I can't wait to see your entire family.\"\n\nHe also regularly tweets to Jennifer Aniston (who doesn't use Twitter) and President Donald Trump, and he occasionally references Liam Hemsworth, Cyrus' now-estranged husband.\n\nRumsey currently remains in custody after being booked into a county jail on a felony charge of making threats.", "description": "A 42-year-old man obsessed with the idea of getting Miley Cyrus pregnant has tweeted dozens of alarming messages to the singer.", "authors": ["Jennifer Kline"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cm7uPJcFUfzBtTCx_lwDDA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/ed67c0a0-ded9-11e9-9bba-d4b81cab9040", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
