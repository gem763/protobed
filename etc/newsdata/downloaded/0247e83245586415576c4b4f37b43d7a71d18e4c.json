The same forces early last year seized the Kurdish canton of Afrin, in northwest Syria, after a two-month campaign against the YPG.\n\nWith the landscape of Syria's northeast comprising low and open plains well-suited to armoured and mechanised units, analysts said a potential battle would seem to offer a swift victory for Turkey.\n\n\"It will be easier than Euphrates Shield,\" said Selim Sazak, research director at Ankara consultancy TUM Strategy, referring to the Aleppo operation. \"Not only is the terrain less tough but there is not the worry about ISIS moving into areas cleared of the YPG.\"\n\nAnalysts also pointed out that even though the SDF gained a lot of experience after fighting ISIL, whenever they were faced with air raids, tanks and heavy artillery - as in Turkey's previous Syria operations - they were swiftly overrun.\n\n\"There are two options for the SDF,\" Sazak said. \"Either fight tooth and nail or not at all. I don't envision a prolonged medium-intensity fight. It will be a flash or they will retreat.\"\n\n191007205116067\n\nKamal Alam, a London-based military analyst on Turkey and Syria, agreed the operation should not present any serious difficulty for Turkish forces.\n\n\"Turkey should not have any problems due to their superiority in air power and artillery,\" he said.\n\nKasapoglu agreed that Turkey had the capacity to \"blitz\" its opponents with the campaign \"likely to register swift achievements\" if backed by sufficient air support.\n\nDespite the Turkish military superiority, the SDF possesses weapons such as anti-tank guided missiles and man-portable air defence systems.\n\nThe SDF has also gained significant battle experience over its year-long campaign against ISIL, backed by US air power, artillery and special forces.\n\nThe group's leadership reacted forcefully to the threat of a Turkish operation, warning it would \"not hesitate to turn any unprovoked attack into an all-out war\".\n\nJavelin anti-tank missiles, in particular, could present a threat to Turkish armour, Kasapoglu said, while air missiles such as the Russian SA-18 pose a risk to aircraft, especially helicopters.", "description": "Ankara expected to send its forces across the border in northeast Syria following US move to withdraw troops from area.", "authors": ["Andrew Wilks"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/3e1732894821455ebfae38b7c4a8bd2c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
