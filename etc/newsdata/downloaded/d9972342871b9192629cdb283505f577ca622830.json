So, they want a narrower range of mmWave frequencies to be offered than mobile networks would like.\n\nFiona Vanier, a senior analyst at CCS Insight, said: \"Meteorologists are concerned that radio frequencies such as 23.8GHz [at the beginning of the mmWave zone] contaminate Earth observations such as water-vapour detection.\"\n\nWeather data\n\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) told BBC News it feared its ambitious Copernicus project could be compromised.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC News puts 5G connectivity to the test on two phones, downloading a podcast.\n\nThe Earth observation programme uses vast amounts of data to help study climate change.\n\nThe ESA said mobile networks' use of high-frequency 5G airwaves could also affect its ability to communicate with satellites, including those used to collect weather data.\n\n\"Those remote sensors constitute an essential part of the global numerical weather prediction and are key in the observation of the global climate,\" a spokesman said.\n\nThe GSM Association (GSMA) trade body said the WRC event, which is held every four years, was a \"make or break moment\" for 5G.\n\nImage copyright WRC-19 Image caption 5G mmWave is designed to drive the next generation of robots and AI\n\nAnd its head of spectrum, Brett Tarnutzer, accused the ESA of \"fear mongering\".\n\n\"[Studies have] demonstrated that 5G using mmWave spectrum can co-exist safely and efficiently alongside weather-sensing services, commercial satellite services and others,\" he said.\n\n\"This protectionist attitude will have consequences for our global economy if allowed to prevail.\"\n\nThe BBC Click team will explore these issues further this weekend", "description": "European Space Agency warns some airwaves will compromise work on climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7A83/production/_109436313_gettyimages-1135132214-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
