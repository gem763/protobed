So reports T he Washington Post , which, earlier this month, featured an article about Ashlawn Elementary School, which honored National \u201cRead Across America Day\u201d by hosting a transgender spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). The spokesperson read a story about a transgender child for a room full of kindergarten children.\n\nProminent media outlets claimed parents were notified beforehand and allowed opt their children out of the event. But those outlets got the story wrong. The letter, written solely in English despite the school\u2019s sizable non-English-fluent population, nowhere mentions \u201copting out.\u201d\n\nMedia, District Lie About Pro-Transgender Event\n\n\u201cDozens of kindergarten students\u201d sat cross-legged in homosexual activist teacher Jaim Foster\u2019s classroom at Ashlawn Elementary School on February 28 while HRC representative and \u2018\u201ctransgender rights advocate\u201d Sarah McBride read them a picture book about a transgender girl. The book was \u201cI Am Jazz\u201d by Jazz Jennings, who talked about being a transgender teen on a TLC show.\n\nAlso in attendance was Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, president of the National Education Association (NEA), an organization that welcomed LGBT groups to serve as official sponsors of this year\u2019s national reading event.\n\nThe Arlington school district claimed that \u201cparents were notified by a letter ahead of time and were allowed to opt out of they chose.\u201d Mainstream media crowed that no parents chose this option. One parent quoted by a local television channel stated: \u201cWe see children very young who know they don\u2019t identify with the gender they are assigned. Wouldn\u2019t it be better if their classmates understood and had empathy towards them versus treating them different or with disdain or violence?\u201d\n\nHowever, this record of events is not accurate. A copy of the February 22 letter provided to the Family Foundation of Virginia under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act shows absolutely no offer for parents to pull their kids out of the activity.\n\nMoreover, although the letter notes that a book written by a transgender person would be read to the class, it does not explicitly say that kindergarteners will be told they may have a \u201cgirl brain but a boy body\u201d or a boy brain and a girl body, as the book claims. Nor does it say that the kids would be read to by a cross-dressing man who calls himself \u201cSarah.\u201d Rather, it says only that \u201cthere will be discussion around the big ideas of the books which are we want to accept and welcome all people.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ashlawn draws its students from a multilingual community in diverse northern Virginia \u2014 requiring a formal English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) program \u2014 the school provided only an English-language letter to parents. Linda Erdos, assistant superintendent for Arlington County Schools, claimed in an email to the Family Foundation of Virginia that \u201cwhile the classes included a small number of students who speak another language at home, the parents of those students speak and read English as well as the second language.\u201d\n\nI previously taught high school ESOL in neighboring Fairfax County, and find it unlikely that every parent who doesn\u2019t speak English as his or her first language fully understood what was being offered to his or her children.\n\nImposing LGBTQ Ideology on 5-Year-Olds\n\nApart from the misleading information provided by both the media and Arlington County Public Schools, there are more essential problems with events for children that promote explicitly LGBTQ ideology. Children are incredibly impressionable. As a father of a 6-year-old, 3-year-old, and 2-year-old, I have consistently witnessed them believing just about anything other children or adults tell them. If an adult tells them they may not the biological sex they presumed themselves to be, they are liable to start questioning themselves, even if this wasn\u2019t anywhere near their mental radar.\n\nChildren and parents are not being told the whole truth regarding transgenderism, either. Former transgender person Walt Heyer has noted : \u201cParents need to know that up to 94 percent of school-age kids who identify as transgender will grow out of their desire to change genders as adults.\u201d Moreover, data show that kids\u2019 lives are put at risk when schools encourage them to identify themselves as gay or transgender at an early age. Heyer observes: \u201cFor each year children delay labeling themselves as LGBT, their suicide risk is reduced by 20 percent.\u201d\n\nMoreover, as the noted Dr. Leonard Sax has discussed , the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is officially recommending that the wishes of young children, including kindergarteners, be prioritized if they claim to reject their biological sex, including with \u201ccross-sex hormones, castration, and infertility.\u201d So public schools that teach transgender ideology to kindergarteners may be setting up their families for a medical hijacking if their confused child discusses the topic with the family pediatrician.\n\nThis prioritizes the whims of children over the wisdom and loving care of parents who disapprove of physical and hormonal castration for children, or simply prefer a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach. There is little evidence to substantiate the AAP\u2019s recommendation, the implementation of which can and will cause irreparable damage to children.\n\nConsider also the biased, preferential treatment of the HRC , NEA, and many public school districts. They promote those who pretend to be the opposite sex, and welcome their presence at public events meant to persuade those of all ages of the acceptableness of their decisions.\n\nAssuming that any of this is age-appropriate for elementary schoolers, would any of these organizations or school districts welcome Walt Heyer, Jamie Shupe , or the many others who have similar stories of regret regarding their earlier gender transformation decisions ? Would they be willing to accept an alternative testimony that speaks of the potential risks and dangers involved? Would they allow a perspective from prominent lesbian and feminist activists who have declared the obvious truth that men are not women? Of course not.\n\nThis Is Coming to a Community Like Yours\n\nTrends suggest that no part of America will be left untouched by this ideological campaign. As sociologist Mark Regnerus recently noted , self-identified transgender Americans once comprised around 0.3 percent of the population as recently as 2011. That doubled by 2016. A new study, relying on a statewide survey in Minnesota, revealed that 3 percent of adolescents now identify as transgender.\n\n\u201cThe rapid onset of gender dysphoria among adolescents is odd,\u201d observes Regnerus (to say the least). Meanwhile sociologists like Regnerus who make note of these bizarre, rapid social transformations are persecuted by the academy for exposing the connection between aggressive LGBTQ propaganda and rising rates of adolescent transgenderism.\n\nParents and all those who care about the welfare of our nation\u2019s children must raise their voices regarding this aggressive offensive, lest their own families suffer the consequences . As I\u2019ve argued elsewhere , many of America\u2019s public schools are no longer safe places for our children.", "description": "Parents were not informed by their kindergarteners would be read a transgender book by a cross-dressing male LGBT activist who calls himself 'Sarah.'", "authors": ["Casey Chalk"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/120710-F-ZL760-013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-18"}
