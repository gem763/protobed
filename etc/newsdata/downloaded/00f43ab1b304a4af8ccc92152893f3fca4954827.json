Every Roger Federer Nike kit at Wimbledon: RANKED and RATED 1/20 Every Roger Federer Nike kit at Wimbledon: RANKED and RATED Searching Roger Federer's name on Google reveals \"about 36,500,000 results\", and yet not a single one of those is dedicated to reviewing each one of his all white Nike Wimbledon kits in exacting detail. This is, quite frankly, scandalous and needs to remedied immediately. Possibly. We think. Getty 2/20 2001 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: Are those ... beads?! Come on Roger, you're playing on the pristine lawns of the The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, not backpacking around Goa like a poundshop version of Eyal from Love Island. A poor start.\n\n\n\nRating: 2/10 Popperfoto/Getty Images 3/20 2013 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: Oh dear. Clearly aiming for classy, but with the hideous end result of looking like a cross between a chemist and somebody halfheartedly role-playing as a sexy nurse.\n\n\n\nRating: 3/10 Getty Images 4/20 2000 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: The hat is floppy, the sleeves are baggy and the hair needs a trim. And that's a Harry Hill collar if ever we saw one. Nope, we're not fans.\n\n\n\nRating: 3.25/10 AFP/Getty Images 5/20 2010 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: It's a classy colour combo, but it all looks a bit - frilly - doesn't it? Would have gone down well in the 1920s but it's not doing much for us, Clive.\n\n\n\nRating: 4.1/10 Getty Images 6/20 2002 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: Not too much to argue with here, that flash of blue is inoffensive if a little bland, while everything is decidedly more slim-cut than that baggy 2000 effort. Docked points for the man bun, however.\n\n\n\nRating: 5.5/10 Getty Images 7/20 2012 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: The ten-year turquoise anniversary effort. Wasn't worth bringing back, to be honest with you. Next.\n\n\n\nRating: 5.5111111/10 Getty Images 8/20 2017 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: Those naughty flashes of hot pink just about stop this effort from sliding towards the bottom of this list. Picks up some extra points for the manly new hairstyle. Federer is even receding in style.\n\n\n\nRating: 5.999999999999/10 Action Plus via Getty Images 9/20 BONUS ENTRY: 2018 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: Okay TECHNICALLY this shouldn't be included as it's not a Nike effort, but we couldn't find any pictures of a baby-faced Federer strolling the lawns in 1999, so it makes the cut. First impressions: meh.\n\n\n\nRating: 6/10 AFP/Getty Images 10/20 2016 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: Exactly the same as the previous picture but with a Nike tick instead of the Uniqlo square. Picks up that all important extra 0.25 of a mark on account of the nicely cut shorts.\n\n\n\nRating: 6.25/10 Getty Images 11/20 2007 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: A white and gold number that aims for classy but falls just slightly the wrong side of gaudy. That gold piping is just that bit too ostentatious, isn't it? We all know you're good, mate: don't rub it in.\n\n\n\nRating: 6.9/10 Getty Images 12/20 2015 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: A bold year for Fed, who decided to go all Peaky Blinders on us with an inspired Grandad collar. And with an absolute Persian rug of a chest like that, why not?\n\n\n\nRating: 6.5/10 (+0.5 for chest hair) Getty Images 13/20 2014 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: Very similar to his 2016 strip, but the subtle stripes on that polo elevate this effort to new heights. And look how high up that Nike swoosh is! Revolutionary.\n\n\n\nRating: 7/10 AFP/Getty Images 14/20 2005 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: This is bold. Sleek. Futuristic. Federer is a man who likes his collars and cable knits, but he proved he could also rock a round-neck with this natty little number. More of this, please.\n\n\n\nRating: 7.2/10 Bongarts/Getty Images 15/20 2003 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: We're big fans of that cycle-shirt style collar, which looks like something manufactured by Rapha. And look at those Hundertwasser-esque blobs under his arm pit! All in all a svelte, artistic design. Love it.\n\n\n\nRating: 7.5/10 Bongarts/Getty Images 16/20 2009 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: Oh yes. This is what the 2007 effort should have looked like. Subtle stripe effect. Tasteful flashes of gold. Big old sweatband for wiping the ambrosia from his brow. Decent.\n\n\n\nRating: 8/10 Getty Images 17/20 2004 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: Vintage cool. Nicely cut, big ol' bandanna and lots and a lot of unnecessary but very cool panels.\n\n\n\nRating: 8.5/10 Bongarts/Getty Images 18/20 2008 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: Oh yes. Yessssss. A refinement of everything that came before: the perfect size collar. The perfect amount of colour. The perfect tailored fit. Woof.\n\n\n\nRating: 9/10 Getty Images 19/20 2006 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: Just look at that face. More importantly: look at that jacket. This was the moment that Federer turned from well-dressed tennis star to bona fide fasion icon. This was the Federer that David Foster Wallace fell in love with. Top marks - although only good enough for the runners-up spot on our sartorial hit list.\n\n\n\nRating: 10/10 Getty Images 20/20 2011 Colour: White\n\n\n\nVerdict: And here it is: fashion perfection. He looks like the head boy of an impossibly expensive private school. A member of the British Diplomatic Service in the twenties. The guy that your girlfriend told you not to worry about. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the coolest any man has ever looked at Wimbledon. Bravo.\n\n\n\nRating: 176/10 Getty Images 1/20 Every Roger Federer Nike kit at Wimbledon: RANKED and RATED Searching Roger Federer's name on Google reveals \"about 36,500,000 results\", and yet not a single one of those is dedicated to reviewing each one of his all white Nike Wimbledon kits in exacting detail.

But this is the right thing to do if I want to continue to play for a longer period of time on the ATP Tour.\n\n\u201cI am sorry for any inconvenience or disappointment my withdrawal may cause for the fans, but I hope you can understand why I made it.\n\n\u201cFor my Australian fans, I look forward to seeing you all at the Australian Open, fresh and ready to go.\u201d\n\nAs a result of his withdrawal, Switzerland drop out of the tournament as they only qualified due to Federer\u2019s ranking.\n\nPA", "description": "Roger Federer has dropped out of the ATP Cup in January, meaning there will be no showdown with Andy Murray.
