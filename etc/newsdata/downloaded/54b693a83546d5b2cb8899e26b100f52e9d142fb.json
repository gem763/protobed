We are successfully balancing our global responsibilities with sensible and practical policies to ensure our environmental and our economic future,\" Morrison told the UN.\n\nI think it really sullies Australia's reputation. \u2014 Amanda McKenzie, Climate Council chief executive\n\nMirroring comments made by federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor, the Prime Minister said Australia was well on track to meet its Paris commitments. He also pointed out the nation's emissions per capita and the emissions intensity of the economy were at their lowest levels in almost three decades.\n\nMorrison's comments sent climate change activists into a head spin. Climate Council chief executive Amanda McKenzie went as far as describing the PM's comments about Australia doing enough on climate change as \"colossal bullshit\".\n\n\"What got me was Scott Morrison saying this to the United Nations. I think it really sullies Australia's reputation,\" McKenzie told AFR Weekend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Standing in front of other countries who can see what we're doing and trying to pull the wool over their eyes \u2013 but other countries can see what's going on. It's nationally embarrassing. It's very frustrating and it's important to call it out.\"\n\nThe biggest gripe of critics of the government's climate policies is the proposal to use excess carbon reductions from the previous Kyoto agreement to count towards the 2030 Paris target.\n\nThe so-called \"Kyoto carry-over\" would allow 367 million tonnes of excess emissions from the 2020 target to be rolled over towards the 695 million tonnes abatement task.\n\nIt's a no-brainer why Morrison and Taylor are so keen to embrace the Kyoto carry-over. It reduces Australia's carbon reduction task from 695 million tonnes in 2030 to 328 million tonnes.\n\nIt is not clear whether Australia will be allowed to use the 367 million unused allocation of carbon emission reductions from the first (2008-2012) and second (2013-2020) Kyoto commitments. This detail will be nutted out at future UN climate meetings.\n\nRegardless, McKenzie claims it's a sham because the use of Kyoto carry-over credits would mean Australia could cut corners to reach its 2030 Paris targets.\n\nIf Australia says, 'we're going to use it, bugger you', I don't think there's much they can do apart from huff and puff a lot. \u2014 Tony Wood, Grattan Institute energy program director\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Kyoto carry-over would result in Australia only reducing its real emissions by 15 per cent below 2005 levels \u2013 which in Australia's case was 605 million tonnes \u2013 rather than the 26 to 28 per cent target agreed to under the Paris agreement.\n\nMcKenzie believes Australia will be blocked from using the Kyoto carry-over in its bid to reach the 2030 target. She also worries about the global implications if Australia's approach \u2013 as a large emitter \u2013 results in other countries doing the same and watering down the impact of the international climate agreement.\n\n\"That's my main worry - apart from Australia meeting its domestic obligations \u2013 is that if we weaken the rules, if Australia does it, it will allow others to do the same,\" she says.\n\nBut Grattan Institute energy program director Tony Wood says it's not clear yet whether Australia could use the Kyoto carry-over credits.\n\n\"At the moment there are no rules post-2020. It doesn't say you can't do it, but it doesn't say you can do it either,\" he says. \"The whole UN process is not very good and doesn't really have mechanisms for calling countries into line on this stuff. So if Australia says, 'we're going to use it, bugger you', I don't think there's much they can do apart from huff and puff a lot.\"\n\nBased on our track record there is every chance we will overachieve on Paris as well. \u2014 Angus Taylor, federal Energy Minister\n\nWood says there is little doubt Australia has made inroads into its carbon reduction task. \"The gap has closed a lot since 2014, from 1.3 billion tonnes to 695 million tonnes. We are absolutely making progress,\" he says.\n\nBut Wood warns the Kyoto carry-over is more than half of Australia's carbon reduction task between 2020 and 2030.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, it could just delay tougher cuts down the track, especially as all nations \u2013 and companies \u2013 try to move to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.\n\n\"It [the carry-over] is significant because without it, even pretending we're on track becomes bogus. That's why it's so important to Australia,\" says Wood.\n\n\"After 2030 it's just going to be much harder for us. Even though it looks like we have achieved a diminishing emissions outcome, we haven't. It's delaying the pain. We are going to have to come down faster later.\"\n\nBut Taylor won't have a bar of it, saying Australia shouldn't be punished for overachieving on the Kyoto agreement.\n\n\"Australia has worked hard to achieve what we have achieved; that should be recognised,\" he told AFR Weekend. \"Based on our track record there is every chance we will overachieve on Paris as well. We've laid out how we are going to do it to the last tonne. I think it's time people focus on the facts.\"\n\nAre we doing enough?\n\nTaylor dismisses suggestions the Kyoto carry-over is not in the spirit of the Paris climate change agreement. \"The Kyoto agreement allowed carry-over. It's not a new idea,\" he says.\n\nBut the question remains whether we are doing enough to make genuine inroads on the pathway to 2030 and beyond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the global financial crisis resulted in total emissions falling between 2008 and 2014, they have been slowly creeping up over the past few years.\n\nThe latest figures from the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory show Australia's emissions increased by 0.6 per cent or 3.1 million tonnes of carbon in the 12 months to March this year, up to a total of 538.9 million tonnes.\n\nIt is the fifth year in a row Australia's total emissions have increased.\n\nTaylor points to the 0.4 per cent decrease in the March quarter, saying the big jump in emissions from LNG exports (18.8 per cent) had dragged total emissions higher on an annual basis.\n\n\"Yes, the challenge has been in our LNG exports but they are reducing global emissions because gas is a lower-emitting form of electricity generation and gas is complementary fuel for renewables,\" he says.\n\nTaylor and Morrison have preferred to focus on other aspects of the greenhouse inventory, such as the 40 per cent fall in emissions per capita since 1990. The emissions intensity of the economy has fallen 62.4 per cent over the same period.\n\nCritics says the absolute number of carbon emissions is the only figure that matters, and the emissions per capita and emissions intensity are just a distraction.\n\nTaylor is adamant the government's $3.5 billion climate solutions package will help deliver the 2030 Paris target.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe package includes the rebadged $2 billion Climate Solutions Fund (formerly the Emissions Reduction Fund), which funds programs ranging from paying for farmers to grow trees, to burying carbon in landfill and waste, and companies installing energy-efficient lightbulbs \u2013 to reduce carbon that would have otherwise ended up in the atmosphere.\n\nPumped hydro projects such as Snowy 2.0, Tasmania's \"battery of the nation\" and the second Bass Link will continue to provide reliable back-up power.\n\nFinally, the package includes a national electric vehicle strategy, helping households and businesses improve energy efficiency and supporting local communities to create \"green and clean local environments\".\n\nThere is little doubt the influx of renewable energy is having an impact on reducing carbon emissions in the National Electricity Market, despite the side-effect of making the NEM less reliable and squeezing out coal-fired generators.\n\nThe electricity sector, which as the biggest emitter has been the focal point of the national climate policy, reduced its emissions by 2.1 per cent in the year to March.\n\nUpdated figures for the National Electricity Market show emissions decreased by 2.8 per cent seasonally adjusted in the June quarter, mostly due to increased wind (14.8 per cent) and hydro generation (42 per cent).\n\nThe Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory showed electricity accounted for a third, or 33.1 per cent, of Australia's carbon emissions.\n\nThis is followed by \"stationary energy\", including big manufacturers such as steel and aluminium production, which make up 19.3 per cent of total emissions. (The boom in LNG exports resulted in a 5.1 per cent increase in emissions from this category in the past year.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTransport (18.8 per cent), agriculture (12.7 per cent), fugitive emissions (11.1 per cent), industrial processes and product use (6.4 per cent) and waste (2.2 per cent) make up the remainder.\n\nLand use, land use change and forestry's share of total emissions \u2013 which is effectively stopping tree clearing \u2013 was the only group to fall, down by 3.5 per cent.\n\nAustralia's total emissions have decreased by 10.9 per cent (or 66 million tonnes of carbon dioxide) since 1990.\n\nOver that time, the transport sector has experienced the largest growth, increasing 64.9 per cent (or 39.8 million tonnes) over the past 30 years.\n\nAll other sectors, bar land use, land use change and forestry, have experienced an increase in emissions since 1990.\n\nAll options\n\nEvery time a Productivity Commission report recommends action on road-user charging, which would be a start to reducing emissions from the transport sector, politicians run for the hills.\n\nBusiness Council of Australia president and former Origin Energy chief executive Grant King says the electricity sector cannot do all the heavy lifting to reach the Paris targets alone.\n\n\"It's important we remember we also need to make progress in transport and agricultural sectors. All options have to be on the table.\" he told The Australian Financial Review in June.\n\nAnd there is no way to avoid that truth.", "description": "Australia has committed to reduce carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030, but paths diverge on how best to reach the target.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6296%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_668%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/db77d848cd6a181166fab77b098b1ae499a90a47", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
