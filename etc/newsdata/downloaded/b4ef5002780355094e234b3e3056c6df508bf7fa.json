The implementation date is subject to the process to be followed with the Department of Higher Education and Training in order to change the statute of the university.\n\n\"The goal of the new policy is to facilitate social cohesion and promote inclusivity,\" she said.\n\nShe said the university would continue to embrace and encourage multilingualism.\n\n\"This decision of the Council and Senate follows an extensive consultation process and recommendations from all stakeholders, including the language work stream that was formed as part of the transformation lekgotla and the independent transformation panel that focused on submissions from external stakeholders.\"\n\nShe said it was also decided that Afrikaans should be maintained as a language of scholarship, while the development of Sepedi to a higher level of scientific discourse should be supported and adequately resourced.\n\nBoth universities adopted their policies on Wednesday.", "description": "The universities of Pretoria and Stellenbosch have adopted new language policies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3720/c917e854308b4e8dbbf4d7acf121ffba.jpg", "published_at": "2016-06-23"}
