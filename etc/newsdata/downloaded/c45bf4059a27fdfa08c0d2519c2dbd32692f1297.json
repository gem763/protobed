In reality, she said interest rates are low, incomes and savings are up, which combine to create a great time to buy a home.\n\nWhen asked about those buying homes, Palmer said she's seeing lot of strength from both the millennials and boomers, with about a third of their buyers coming from the millennial category. Those buyers are getting married and are having children and want to settle down just as their parents did.\n\nLet's check out the technical story before we go to closing.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of TMHC, below, we can see that prices have been in a durable uptrend since October. There have been some pullbacks along the way but new highs continue to be set. TMHC is above the rising 50-day moving average line and the bullish 200-day line.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a similar uptrend to confirm the price gains. The Moving Average Convergence is rising and above the zero line.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of TMHC, below, we can see that prices are climbing their way back to the prior high around $28. Price is above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line just made a new high telling us that buyers of TMHC have been more aggressive. The MACD oscillator is bullish.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of TMHC, below, we can see a nearby price target of $27.34.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Continue with the long side with a sell stop below $22. New highs look likely.", "description": "Taylor Morrison Home Is Building Toward New Highs...TMHC", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Taylor Morrison Home Is Building Toward New Highs", "Here'S How We Would Play This Homebuilder", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Paul Price", "Jim Cramer", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/7f38d043-64e8-11e8-bc9b-2d198cfedc39.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
