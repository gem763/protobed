The company\u2019s legal team has reached the decision that ARM\u2019s v8 and v9 architectures are \u201cUK-origin technologies\u201d and therefore not subject to the United States\u2019 trade ban, which limits US companies from working with Huawei, per a report from Reuters. The ban was put in place over national security concerns regarding the Chinese telecommunications company.\n\n\u201cARM can provide support to HiSilicon for the ARM v8-A architecture, as well as the next generation of that architecture, following a comprehensive review of both architectures, which have been determined to be of UK origin,\u201d commented an ARM spokeswoman to Reuters.\n\nThe decision is good news for Huawei since it allows the company to continue to create its own chips for its devices through HiSilicon, its semiconductor company. While products like Huawei\u2019s Kirin 990 processor are designed in-house, they rely heavily on ARM\u2019s designs for both the CPU and GPU. Without ARM\u2019s licensing, Huawei would effectively be unable to produce new processors, making the decision a substantial one regarding Huawei\u2019s ability to produce new phones.\n\nARM cut ties with Huawei in May due to the Trump\u2019s trade ban out of concerns that its chip designs might contain \u201cUS origin technology.\u201d ARM is based in the UK and owned by the SoftBank Group in Japan, but the company has offices in the United States in California, Washington, Arizona, Texas, and Massachusetts where employees \u2014 at least in theory \u2014 help develops processor designs. Now, with ARM concluding that its chips are of \u201cUK origin,\u201d it\u2019s saying that it isn\u2019t included in the US ban.\n\nIt\u2019s not the end of Huawei\u2019s problems, however. New phones sold by the company still can\u2019t offer Google\u2019s apps and services (including the Play Store), which are critical for actually selling Android devices outside of China. But with ARM continuing to work with Huawei, it\u2019ll at least be able to continue to make the phones.", "description": "ARM will continue to license its chip architectures to Huawei.
