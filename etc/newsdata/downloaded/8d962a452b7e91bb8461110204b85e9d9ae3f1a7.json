Add Interest\n\nThe investigation, launched more than three years ago, determined that those 38 people were \"culpable\" in 91 cases of sending classified information that ended up in Clinton's personal email, according to a letter sent to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley this week and released on Friday. The 38 are current and former State Department officials but were not identified.\n\nAlthough the report identified violations, it said investigators had found \"no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.\" However, it also made clear that Clinton's use of the private email had increased the vulnerability of classified information.\n\nThe Associated Press sent an email seeking comment to a Clinton representative.\n\nThe investigation covered 33,000 emails that Clinton turned over for review after her use of the private email account became public. The department said it found a total of 588 violations involving information then or now deemed to be classified but could not assign fault in 497 cases.\n\nFor current and former officials, culpability means the violations will be noted in their files and will be considered when they apply for or go to renew security clearances. For current officials, there could also be some kind of disciplinary action. But it was not immediately clear what that would be.\n\nThe report concluded \"that the use of a private email system to conduct official business added an increased degree of risk of compromise as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of State Department networks.\"\n\nThe department began the review in 2016 after declaring 22 emails from Clinton's private server to be \"top secret.\" Clinton was then running for president against Donald Trump, and Trump made the server a major focus of his campaign.\n\nThen-FBI Director James Comey held a news conference that year in which he criticized Clinton as \"extremely careless\" in her use of the private email server as secretary of state but said the FBI would not recommend charges.\n\nThe Justice Department's inspector general said FBI specialists did not find evidence that the server had been hacked, with one forensics agent saying he felt \"fairly confident that there wasn't an intrusion.\"\n\nGrassley started investigating Clinton's email server in 2017, when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Iowa Republican has been critical of Clinton's handling of classified information and urged administrative sanctions.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
