There were reports on Friday of airstrikes and shelling in Ras al-Ayn and Tel Abyad, the Kurdish-held towns that have borne the brunt of the fighting, as Turkish ground troops and their allies sought to close in on both.\n\nWhat is the situation in north-eastern Syria? Read more\n\nThousands of civilians have fled from both towns as well as surrounding villages, and a camp of at least 4,000 displaced Syrians near Ras al-Ayn has been evacuated after Turkish artillery landed nearby, Kurdish administrators said.\n\nTurkey\u2019s vice-president said on Friday evening that his country\u2019s troops had advanced five miles into north-eastern Syria.\n\nKurdish activists reported at least one car bomb explosion outside a popular restaurant in the town of Qamishli on Friday afternoon, amid fears that Islamic State might use the fighting to launch its own attacks. A Kurdish media collective, the Rojava Information Centre, said one person was killed and no group has yet claimed responsibility.\n\nTel Abyad\u2019s hospital was closed after most of its staff left, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said. \u201cOur staff in Tel Abyad witnessed the town, that was once filled with life, become deserted,\u201d said Robert Onus, the group\u2019s emergency manager for Syria.\n\nThe US defence secretary, Mark Esper, told his Turkish counterpart to halt the offensive or risk \u201cserious consequences for Turkey\u201d, but it is unclear what effect that would have on a government in Ankara that believes it has the backing of the US president.\n\n\u201cWhile the secretary reaffirmed [that] we value our strategic bilateral relationship, this incursion risks serious consequences for Turkey,\u201d Esper told Turkey\u2019s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, in a phone call. Esper said Turkey\u2019s actions posed a threat to US personnel stationed in Syria.\n\n\u201cAs part of the call, Secretary Esper strongly encouraged Turkey to discontinue actions in north-eastern Syria in order to increase the possibility that the United States, Turkey and our partners could find a common way to de-escalate the situation before it becomes irreparable,\u201d a Pentagon account of the call said.\n\nAbout 64,000 people have fled Syria since the campaign began, according to the International Rescue Committee aid group. The Kurdish Red Crescent said on Thursday night that 11 civilians had been killed in the fighting, including an 11-year-old boy in Qamishli.\n\nClashes were reported overnight at different spots along the border, from Ain Diwar at the Iraqi frontier, to Kobane, more than 250 miles (400km) to the west.\n\nKurdish officials in al-Hawl camp, where around 400 guards watch over more than 60,000 female members of Isis and their children, claimed there were violent demonstrations on Friday morning which they characterised as a failed escape attempt. Such unrest has been frequent in the camp in recent months.\n\nPlay Video 4:04 What does Turkey's military action in northern Syria mean? \u2013 video explainer\n\nThe reports of the fighting, as well as concerns over the fate of about 11,000 detained Isis fighters and their families fuelled criticism of the Turkish offensive in Washington, where the president is under increasing pressure to lay down red lines for Ankara.\n\nTrump\u2019s abrupt decision on Sunday to clear US soldiers from the Turkish-Syrian border in effect gave Turkey a green light to attack the US-backed and Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). It has led to withering criticism from his allies in Congress, the evangelical movement and Israel.\n\nTrump said on Thursday that he hoped he could mediate between Turkey and the SDF but kept open the possibility of doing \u201csomething very, very tough with respect to sanctions and other financial things\u201d against Ankara.\n\nA senior US official told the Guardian that certain Turkish actions could trigger sanctions.\n\n\u201c[Such actions] would include ethnic cleansing,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt would include, in particular, indiscriminate artillery, air and other fire directed at civilian population. That is what we\u2019re looking at right now. We have not seen significant examples of that so far.\u201d\n\nThe French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, has called for an emergency meeting of the coalition of more than 30 countries created to fight Isis. France\u2019s European affairs minister said next week\u2019s EU summit would discuss sanctions on Turkey over its action in Syria.\n\nThe SDF remained in control of the camps and prisons holding Isis detainees and their families, a US state department official said.\n\nTurkish defence officials claim their forces have killed 277 Kurdish militants, a figure that could not be verified. They have confirmed the death of two soldiers, the latest on Friday afternoon.", "description": "Airstrikes and shells hit north-east as Trump raises possibility of sanctions on Ankara", "authors": ["Michael Safi", "Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5bc159b2784f8c7051b6a99c93fbb3ff20b866b/0_300_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0f73b6be91cdd74984365c8c0f4c739f", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
