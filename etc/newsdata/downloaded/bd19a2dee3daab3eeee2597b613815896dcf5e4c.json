Never before has their management undercut their scientifically sound reasoning and forecasts,\u201d Sobien told The Daily Beast.\n\nSobien\u2019s reaction is the latest development in a storm-fueled sideshow that has consumed the president for much of the week and been dubbed Sharpie-gate.\n\nIt began Sunday, when President Trump tweeted out that Dorian was expected to hit Alabama\u2014and the NWS\u2019s Birmingham office posted a correction:\n\n\u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east,\u201d the tweet said.\n\nThen on Wednesday, Trump held up a weather map in the Oval Office that showed the track of the storm, outlined in white. It appeared someone had used a black marker, like the ones Trump favors, to extend that track into Alabama.\n\nSince then, Trump has dug in his heels, blasting out multiple tweets insisting that Dorian was forecast to hit Alabama and issuing a statement from his Homeland Security Adviser that backed up his version.\n\nThen on Friday came the statement from an unnamed spokesperson that said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Hurricane Center had given Trump information that \u201cdemonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama.\u201d\n\nThe statement went on to criticize the Birmingham office\u2019s Sunday tweet, saying it \u201cspoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d\n\nSoon after, Sobien issued a tweet about the NOAA statement: \u201cI have never been so embarrassed by NOAA. What they did is just disgusting.\u201d\n\nHe later told The Daily Beast that in a Facebook group discussion, workers were so upset they were talking about defacing their NOAA T-shirts with a Sharpie. More seriously, they worried the statement could have real-life consequences.\n\n\u201cWhat is very important is when the NWS issues a hurricane warning or flash flood warning\u2014it's very important [that] everyone is on the same page. It's hard enough to convince people to evacuate or take cover. If you have confusion, it could be very bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre people not going to believe the Hurricane Center or our forecasts now?\u201d", "description": "\u201cAre people not going to believe the Hurricane Center or our forecasts now?\u201d", "authors": ["Tracy Connor", "Executive Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2759,w_4906,x_0,y_470/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567818994/GettyImages-1164628719_1_voi05o", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
