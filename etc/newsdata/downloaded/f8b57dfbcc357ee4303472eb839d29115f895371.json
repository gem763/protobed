( FDX ) is due to report its latest quarterly results Tuesday. Let's visit with the charts and indicators to see if investors who may be close to the company are shifting their positions.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of FDX, below, we can see that prices have lost ground the past 12 months but there has been some stability since early June with FDX holding the $150 area on the downside and the $180 area keeping a lid on gains. FDX is testing the declining 200-day moving average line from below and staying above the slightly rising 50-day moving average line.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a slight improvement from the June low and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is back above the zero line for an outright go long signal.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of FDX, below, we can see that prices have rallied above the declining 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe trading volume has declined a little but the OBV line is holding the December low. The MACD oscillator is pointed up from below the zero line reminding us that we should cover our short positions.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of FDX, below, we can see a modest nearby price target of $180.45 being projected. A trade at $178.74 will be an upside breakout and should open the way to further gains.\n\nBottom-line strategy: FDX is not showing us a really strong pattern ahead of earnings but it is a constructive pattern and a long position is favored risking a close below $159. A rally to the $200-$210 area is possible.", "description": "FedEx Is Sending Constructive Signals Ahead of Earnings...FDX", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Fedex Is Sending Constructive Signals Ahead Of Earnings", "Fdx Could Trade Higher In The Weeks Ahead.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "James", "Rev Shark", "Bob Lang", "Carolyn Boroden", "Real Money"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/339e06cc-31eb-11e8-b78e-83b6510aba0b.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
