Juul hasn\u2019t submitted its products for review.\n\n\u201cIn addition,\u201d Sharpless added, \u201cwe\u2019re troubled about several issues related to JUUL\u2019s outreach and marketing practices that came to light in a recent Congressional hearing. We will continue to scrutinize tobacco product marketing and take action as appropriate to ensure that the public is not misled into believing a certain product has been proven less risky or less harmful.\u201d\n\nYahoo Finance previously reported that Juul\u2019s ads bore an uncanny similarity to those pushed out by Big Tobacco in previous decades.\n\nThe FDA is \u201cfinally stepping up and calling out at least one of the e-cigarette companies,\u201d Dr. Joshua Mansour, an oncologist in Los Angeles, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cI know that there are several of them, not just Juul, but it's a step moving forward towards getting a little bit of regulation behind the whole situation.\u201d\n\nA sign advertising Juul brand vaping products is seen outside a shop in Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S., February 6, 2019.
