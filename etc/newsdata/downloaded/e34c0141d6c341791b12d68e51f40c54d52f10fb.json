A celebration of British eccentricity and imagination, in each film the owner gives us an intimate guided tour and tells us the story of their unique property.\n\nIn a Victorian townhouse in Stockwell, south London, there\u2019s a hidden handmade haven. A vintage trunk overflows with scraps of floral patterned material. Upstairs, the bathroom tiles are individually hand-painted with illustrations of ladybirds, butterflies, botanicals, beetles and birds.\n\nIn the kitchen, previously unsightly units have been covered with shells, corks and broken china. Dried fruit, leaves and flowers from the nearby New Covent Garden Flower Market are strung across the fireplaces, and every room is scattered with cut-out paper shapes, origami birds, bunting and hand-drawn \u00adpictures.\n\nThis is the home of Maude Smith, a set designer, decorative painter and dressmaker. Smith grew up in rural Yorkshire, where her parents owned a brewery, and her work as a fashion and interiors stylist is driven by nostalgia for a vanished rural world and for the uninhibited creative freedom of childhood.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really grown up; in some ways I\u2019m still a child,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI find children easier to relate to than grown-ups, [due to] their imagination and sense of adventure.\u201d", "description": "'House Proud' is a series of videos created by the Telegraph which showcase some of Britain's most idiosyncratic, unusual and unforgettable homes.", "authors": ["Madeleine Howell", "Matthew Lynn", "Sam Barker", "Katie Morley", "Lauren Davidson", "Marianna Hunt", "Taha Lokhandwala", "Stephanie Baxter"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/D2GzBC3W180/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
