TechRepublic's Karen Roby sits down with ZDNet's Chris Matyszczyk to learn that, yes, robots are threatening middle-aged workers' jobs, and that includes anyone over 21.

Half (50%) of workers currently use some form of AI at work, compared to only 32% last year. Workers in China (77%) and India (78%) have adopted AI -- twice as much as workers in France (32%) and surprisingly Japan (29%).\n\nTwo out of three (65%) of workers are optimistic about having robot co-workers, and nearly a quarter report having a loving and gratifying relationship with AI at work.\n\nMust read\n\nThe research found that two out of three (64%) trust robots more than their manager, and over four out of five (82%) believe that robots can do some things better than their managers. Half say they have already turned to a robot instead of their manager for advice.\n\nWhen asked what robots can do better than their managers, survey respondents said robots are better at providing unbiased information (26%), maintaining work schedules (34%), problem-solving (29%), and managing a budget (26%).\n\nOracle\n\nManagers, on the other hand, were reported as better being able to understand their feelings (45%), coaching them (33%), and creating a work culture (29%).\n\nAlthough AI is changing the relationship between people and technology at work there are still concerns. Almost seven out of 10 (69%) are concerned about AI collecting data on their work activities. Two out of five (41%) of workers say they would be more comfortable trusting a recommendation from AI with more security\n\nThe main concerns preventing workers from using AI at work are security (31%) and privacy (30%). Interestingly, Gen Z (43%), and millennials (45%) are more concerned about privacy and security at work than Gen X (29%), and baby boomers (23%).\n\nAI has produced a huge change in the way we interact with bots and assistants. In a few years, when AI is so ubiquitous and we no longer are aware of it, will we still be so concerned about Big Brother listening in and invading our privacy? I think, by then, most of us will no longer care.", "description": "Would you trust a robot more than your manager?
