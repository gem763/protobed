It starts a run of showings this week in community screenings nationwide highlighting the rise of teen anxiety and depression.\n\nParents in Seattle seemed perplexed about how to help their children look away from devices and towards other people as a way to combat isolation and social anxiety.\n\nOne mother told ABC News, \u201cIt\u2019s a normal part of being a middle-schooler, they talk about panic attacks and being anxious.\u201d\n\nAnother father who was also worried said of technology, \u201cTheir faces are always in front of that stuff, and it\u2019s informing how they view themselves and what is normal and around them.\u201d\n\nWith headlines of the teen suicide rate doubling since 1999, and sky-rocketing anxiety and depression rates, parents are concerned.\n\nThe film does not tackle the issue of what\u2019s causing this crisis, but it does look at the many forms of mental health challenges that face families, such as anxiety, stress and unresolved trauma.\n\nThe central story of the film, however, focuses on Ruston\u2019s 16 year-old daughter Tessa, who suddenly dipped into depression.\n\nWhile Ruston did see the signs of depression, she says even as a practicing physician, she didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\u201cI had no idea when to step in, what to say, and often it felt like anything I said made it worse,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt like I was just tiptoeing. If I say the wrong thing, it\u2019ll make her never talk to me again. It\u2019s emotional just thinking about it, just how stuck I was.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Tessa found little comfort in social media, the medium for much of her communication with friends. She posted what she thought was a raw assessment of her deep sadness, but it didn\u2019t evoke the response she needed and wanted from her friends.\n\nShe said, \u201cI said this year has been really hard and I\u2019ve learned a lot and I\u2019ve grown a lot, (but) I felt like the response wasn\u2019t acknowledging the truth that I was really trying to put out there \u2026 crickets was almost how it felt to me. I tried so hard to say look I'm not perfect at all and they're like, 'Oh, we love you, we're here for you, and it almost hurt to feel not understood in that sense.\"\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nAnd when Ruston realized how serious her daughter's depression was, this isolation scared her. \u201cI was amazed how many months into her depression she was, and I assumed she was talking to a friend or something, and she said, \u2018No, I haven't told anyone.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt that point, Ruston realized she and her husband, along with mental help professionals, would need to be there to talk to Tessa, but that talking and support needed some work. Ruston says, \u201cI needed to learn how to be comfortable with my feelings, but not over-respond. [I needed to] let her know that I could handle it.\u201d\n\nThrough trial and error, Tessa's parents found some ways to communicate that can work for all parents and teens.\n\nTessa says, \u201cSome of the things my parents said that really helped in the moments of hardship were you\u2019re doing the best you can for where you\u2019re at and what tools you have, especially when I felt really low and incapable. My favorite quote that my dad said that actually really got me through the hard times that felt like forever is \u2018this too shall pass.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe added that a huge barrier to talking with her parents was guilt and shame, that it was her fault that she felt so depressed. But something Ruston said really helped. \u201cMy mom especially reiterated that I wouldn\u2019t be feeling this way if I had the choice.\u201d\n\nThe documentary offers specific advice for parents who feel stonewalled from teens who won\u2019t talk. Here are some of them:\n\nValidate their feelings, accept that they truly do feel the way they say, that it\u2019s not just teen drama. Ruston adds, \u201cthe most important words you may say are \u2018that sounds really hard.\u201d\n\nTake advantage of the moments when teens do want to talk. These sometimes rare occasions are opportunities to prove you won\u2019t judge them or scold them.\n\nWhen you don\u2019t know what to say, ask more questions. Noted therapist John Gottman, who is featured in the documentary, offers some prompts like, \u201cWhat did your friends say? Were you mad? What do you want to do now?\u201d\n\nAvoid offering fixes or solutions. Tessa said, \u201cAll the problem solving, solutions, and enforcements feel so judgmental and stabbing because sometimes I don't even think it\u2019s a problem I just want to share it and the problem solving itself makes it into a negative thing, right away it\u2019s like \u2018this is wrong and you need to make it right.\u2019\u201d\n\nPraise kids with specifics -- hold a mirror up to them so they can\u2019t refute what you say and just like we do with toddlers, catch them doing something right, and then praise the work.\n\nDon\u2019t give up on finding ways to limit screen time -- even if you think that ship has sailed. Sleep and limiting exposure to social media can help kids find their resilience.\n\nLearn how to tolerate a teen\u2019s explosive reaction over screen limits -- you are giving them the gift of boundaries that adults even struggle with.\n\n\u201cScreenagers: The Next Chapter\u201d will be screened in schools and community settings across the country.
