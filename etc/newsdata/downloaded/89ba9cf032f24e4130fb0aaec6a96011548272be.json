This was problematic because the ads were so targeted by collecting information on the underage viewer, which when done without parental consent, is a direct violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).\n\nThe new, \u201csafer environment,\u201d according to YouTube\u2019s statement about the changes, is the video platform's solution to protecting young viewers and putting the control back into the hands of the parents.\n\n\u201cWe built YouTube Kids to create a safer environment for kids to explore their interests and curiosity while giving parents the tools to customize the experience for their kids,\u201d YouTube said in today's statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYouTube said the new plan will recognize that \u201ccontent for a 4-year-old may not be great content for a 10-year-old\" and \"parents will be able to select from three different age groups to choose the right content for their kid.\u201d\n\nThe pre-school group of videos will feature content that, \u201cpromote creativity,\u201d and allows kids to \u201cexplore their interests,\u201d the YouTube statement promised. The \"Younger\" and \"Older\" categories will have videos designed to help kids \"grow independence\" and \u201cexplore music videos, gaming and family vlogs.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe move for the company, owned by Google, comes more than six months after YouTube suspended the comments section on videos of kids.\n\nYouTube believes this new system is designed to increase the protection of its young viewers, but said also it needs the help of parents. \u201cOur systems work hard to exclude content not suitable for each of these age categories . . .
