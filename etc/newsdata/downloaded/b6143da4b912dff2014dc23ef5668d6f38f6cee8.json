In other words, next season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians is gonna be lit.\n\nWhile Kylie hasn't addressed he breakup publicly yet, she is doing the absolute most on Instagram\u2014including a pretty, um, pointed story of her looking at the camera with a bunch of dollar signs all over her face, and singing lyrics to \"Stretch You Out\" by Summer Walker.\n\nAnd THESE, my friend, are the LYRICS Kylie can be heard singing to the camera:\n\n\"What you on your last breath, your last sweat, your last dime?\n\nOut of your fucking mind\n\nCan't you see I'm fucking trying.\n\nYou want pussy six times a week\n\nAnd you never wanna clean up\"\n\nLike...okay Kylie!\n\nP.S. Kylie and Travis still follow each other on Instagram so there's no way he didn't see this.\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "These song lyrics, tho.", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1EhSI.zN_8AeKaddlJppKA--~B/aD02NDI7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/1448065cc22136ba959e6160f905eb5e", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
