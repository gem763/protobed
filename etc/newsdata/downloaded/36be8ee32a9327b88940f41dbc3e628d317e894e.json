But with how easily accessible porn is on the internet and the prevalence of computers, tablets and smartphones in the hands of our kids (or their friends), they will almost certainly stumble upon it at some point \u2014 and probably at a much younger age than you\u2019d expect.\n\nJournalist Lisa Ling recently studied porn use among kids and teenagers on her show This is Life with Lisa Ling. She interviewed self-described porn addicts who were first exposed to pornography at very young ages, including 29-year-old Alexander Rhodes, who now runs an online community for those battling porn addiction.\n\nRevealed: Australia's Favourite Porn Despite the nation\u2019s small size, Australians are the 8th biggest viewers of Pornhub. The online porn site, which is one of the world\u2019s largest, recently provided us with a department store-sized window into the online viewing habits of our nation. Here are the key findings.

They are very likely to see porn online\u2014either with a fairly innocent Google search, through an ad on a seemingly safe website or thanks to some kid at school. Even if you work hard to keep their online experience safe at home\u2014this guide from Common Sense Media can help with that\u2014coming across porn is an inevitability for most kids.\n\nAnd if/when they do see it, it will help inform their view about what sex really is\u2014unless they know that what they\u2019re seeing is not typical of a loving, committed relationship. And the content is much more hardcore than when we were growing up, Devorah Heitner, author of Screenwise: Helping Kids Thrive (and Survive) in Their Digital World, tells the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThere are videos of people engaged in what may or may not be consensual acts that most people don\u2019t prefer\u2014or would require heavy negotiation between partners\u2014and look very violent,\u201d Heitner says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want your 10-year-old son or 5-year-old daughter to assume they are everyday acts.\u201d\n\nAnd while consent takes place among the sex workers in a pornography before the cameras start rolling, kids don\u2019t see those conversations taking place, which can further confuse what consent looks and sounds like.\n\nThis Year's Biggest (And Weirdest) Online Porn Trends Pornhub's 'Year In Review' is an absolute gold mine of data and statistics about what human beings search for when it comes to porn (and how they do it)! With around 81 million visitors every day of the year, Pornhub's database offers the most complete view of exactly what (or who) got people off to in 2017.

This is one more layer in your on-going discussions with your child about consent, body acceptance, pleasure and safety. You shouldn\u2019t try to cover all of this in one conversation\u2014that would be overwhelming or even scary\u2014and there\u2019s no need to start a conversation about pornography while the child is still very young and you have a good grasp on what they\u2019re viewing online.\n\nHowever, you want to tell them about it before they actually see it. And marriage and family therapist Shadeen Francis, who writes sex education curricula for elementary and high school, tells Healthline that by age 11, most kids have been exposed to some type of sexual content online. So when they get their own smartphone, social media accounts or begin to have more freedom online, it\u2019s time to start talking about it.\n\nThat way, you can contextualize any images they might see and help minimise any alarm, disgust, or confusion they might feel if they see porn without previously having known any awareness that the material exists in the first place, says Francis.\n\nDefine the difference between sex and porn\n\nMuch like actors play characters on their favourite TV shows, explain that people who have sex on camera are acting. What they\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t sex between couples who love or care for each other\u2014they are playing a role.\n\nLisa Damour, a psychologist and author of Under Pressure: Confronting the Epidemic of Stress and Anxiety in Girls, tells the Washington Post that another key difference to address is the gender dynamics in porn versus sex:\n\n\u201cPornography coalesces around themes of violence against women,\u201d she says. Explaining this dynamic can help reinforce the values you do want them to learn about treating people (in intimacy or otherwise) with respect, seeking enthusiastic consent and working toward a healthy sex life (someday).\n\nUltimately, the goal of conversations like these is to become an ally with your child. You want them to come to you when they see something scary or confusing\u2014without fear of getting in trouble for it. Let them know they can come to you about anything they hear or see, regardless of how they happened upon it.", "description": "If you already don\u2019t want to talk to your kids about sex, then it\u2019s probably a safe bet that you really don\u2019t want to talk to them about pornography.
