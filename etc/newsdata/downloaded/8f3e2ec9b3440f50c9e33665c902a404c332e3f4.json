However, it seems having his ex down the street isn't enough to deter Liam from renovating his dream home.\n\nCody marked the special moment he moved in with Miley with a sweet Instagram snap, writing: \"move in day\".\n\n(Image: Miley Cyrus/Instagram)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe two popstars started dating just weeks after Miley's very public split from Kaitlynn Carter .\n\nMiley's blossoming romance with the hunky surfer comes after her two-month relationship with Kaitlynn and divorce from handsome actor Liam Hemsworth after one year of marriage was announced.\n\nLiam first spoke out about the devastating affects of the Californian wildfires last November.\n\nReturning to the site at the time, Liam said he was shocked to find giant letters spelling out 'Love' lying scorched in the ashes.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nSharing the harrowing picture on Instagram, he wrote: \"It\u2019s been a heartbreaking few days. This is what\u2019s left of my house. Love. Many people in Malibu and surrounding areas in California have lost their homes also and my heart goes out to everyone who was affected by these fires.\n\n\"I spent the day in Malibu yesterday and it was amazing to see the community pulling together to help each other out in any way they can.
