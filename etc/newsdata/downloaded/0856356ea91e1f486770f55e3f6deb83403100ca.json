Milley said that photos and images from the raid were undergoing a declassification process but that the issue of public release could be resolved in the coming days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is not yet clear how much footage could ultimately be released. But if any is made publicly available, it would also mark another key difference in Trump\u2019s handling of Baghdadi\u2019s death with President Barack Obama\u2019s 2011 operation that led to the death of Osama bin Laden, the founder of extremist group al-Qaeda.\n\nIn that case, Obama refused to release images of bin Laden\u2019s body, citing national security concerns. No video footage of the raid has ever been released by the U.S. government.\n\nWhat video footage might exist of bin Laden\u2019s death, if any, is unclear. CBS News reported in 2011 that 25 helmet cams had recorded the entire bin Laden raid, including the death of the al-Qaeda leader. But a later report from the New Yorker disputed this, saying that officials had watched real-time footage of the target from an unarmed RQ-170 drone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore unambiguous, though no less contentious, were the photos of bin Laden\u2019s body. On May 4, two days after the raid that killed the extremist leader, Obama announced that although the United States was in possession of photos of bin Laden\u2019s body, it would not release them, as they could pose a \u201cnational security risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence or as a propaganda tool,\u201d Obama said in an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not who we are. We don\u2019t trot out this stuff as trophies.\u201d\n\nOfficials told reporters that bin Laden\u2019s body was buried at sea in accordance with Islamic tradition. Images of the body were shown to members of Congress, who told reporters that the images showed a badly disfigured corpse and who disagreed on whether the photographs should be released.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAttempts to legally force the release of the images have failed. In May 2013, a federal appeals court ruled that the release of postmortem images of the al-Qaeda leader could cause \u201cexceptionally grave harm\u201d to Americans, rejecting the calls of the conservative group Judicial Watch. It is suspected that any photographs of the body may have been deliberately destroyed.\n\nThe lack of photographic evidence of bin Laden\u2019s death led to unwanted scrutiny \u2014 already intense because of a number of discrepancies in official accounts of the killing that the White House blamed on the \u201cfog of war.\u201d Fake images of bin Laden\u2019s body spread after his death, while a request from Abdullah bin Laden, Osama\u2019s son, for an official death certificate was later denied.\n\nIf the Trump administration decides to release footage of the raid that led to Baghdadi\u2019s death, it may help quell similar speculation. It may also allow Trump to bask further in a foreign policy move he is proud of. But for those who remember the bin Laden raid, there are worries that releasing the footage could lead to the consequences Obama had hoped to avoid.\n\nDescribing her concern after hearing Trump describe Baghdadi\u2019s death on Sunday, Dana Shell Smith, deputy assistant secretary of state for international media engagement at the time of bin Laden\u2019s death, warned that a celebratory tone could \u201cdamage our deserved claim to the moral high ground.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "\"We don\u2019t trot out this stuff as trophies,\" Obama said in 2011.", "authors": ["Adam Taylor", "Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AlNTc6hZVTHxP5MTk_mKYYnIt9s=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TU3R7MHY4AI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
