I guess when you\u2019ve conquered everything, it stands to reason you\u2019d take a little vacation \u2014 and in the meantime we\u2019re all staring at a black hole.\n\nLast night, as the coup de grace of Fortnite\u2018s tenth season, a black hole sucked up the entire map and booted all of its players out. Fortnite has effectively gone dark \u2014 the official Twitch channel is showing nothing but the black hole surrounded by swirling blue mist. No one\u2019s exactly sure when it\u2019s going to come back, though of course everyone\u2019s losing their collective minds trying to figure it out. Remember when Overwatch used to drum up interest in its newest characters with hints designed to provoke wild, speculative guessing IRL (the Sombra ARG being the best it ever got)? Yeah, this is a lot like this, only somewhat more cosmic in scope.\n\nDid your @fortnitegame suck you & everything else into a black hole? Can\u2019t help you there. But death-by-black-hole is a thing, and there might even be an entire universe on the other side.https://t.co/Toio6gpgdv \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) October 13, 2019\n\nFortnite is, of course, still one of the world\u2019s most popular games (if not the most), meaning there are a lot of players now with not much else to do. I\u2019m not sure if the devs just wanted a vacation, or if they were tired of everyone knowing the secrets of the map and wanted to start fresh. Either way, the black hole is actually kind of tranquil the longer you look at it.\n\nIf you\u2019re not aware, Fortnite has these bizarre cataclysms every now and then. My personal favorite was the arrival of Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet, because I\u2019m a sucker for a good marketing partnership. To give developer Epic Games some credit, it seems to have realized its primary enemy isn\u2019t another game, but boredom. The onslaught of time and ennui can kneecap even the world\u2019s most successful game. So it throws these big old digital monkey wrenches into the works at least once a season.\n\nThe gaming world seems to be split primarily into two people: those who still play Fortnite religiously, and those who left it behind a while back. At least, that\u2019s the impression you\u2019d get from those in the latter camp, as the joke surrounding the black hole swiftly centered around one punchline: \u201cFortnite players have to go outside/find other games/get lives/do literally anything else.\u201d\n\nWe have better holes to stare at than #Fortnite \u2014 Pornhub ARIA (@Pornhub) October 13, 2019\n\nStill, this isn\u2019t the first time Fortnite players have been forced to find a way of occupying themselves \u2014 the game\u2019s gone down for maintenance before. I\u2019d kill to see if Apex Legends or Realm Royale are experiencing a monumental upsurge in users right now as the battle royale junkies hunt for their next fix.\n\nIs it a publicity stunt? Oh, indubitably. Is it still a pretty hilarious way to simultaneously reset the map and give the massive player base a chance to poke their heads out of their metaphorical groundhog burrows? Heck yes it is.\n\nRead next: The Google Nest Mini sure looks a lot like the Home Mini", "description": "Fortnite has hit the mother of all reset buttons by destroying its map with a black hole.
