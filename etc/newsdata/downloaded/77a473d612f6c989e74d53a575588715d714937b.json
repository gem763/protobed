After England, the U.S. plays two other Tier One nations in France and Argentina and ends the pool against Tonga.\n\nThe Americans will also start 19-year-old prop David Ainu\u2019u of Toulouse alongside Taufete\u2019e and Lamositele. He\u2019s one of 14 out of the 23 who will be making their World Cup debuts.\n\nThe U.S. squad has been preparing in Okinawa and only travels to Kobe for the game this week. England opened its World Cup by beating Tonga 35-3 on Sunday. England wasn\u2019t convincing against the Tongans in Sapporo but coach Eddie Jones said his players want to ramp up their performance against the Americans.\n\n\u201cWe have massive respect for England as they are a very well-coached and talented rugby team,\u201d Gold said. \u201cThese are exactly the kind of competitive test matches we want to play to continuously test ourselves and grow as a rugby nation.\u201d\n\nAmerican scrumhalf Shaun Davies can also call on some experience playing the English. He went on an under-20 tour to England in 2010 and lined up against current England captain Owen Farrell and flyhalf George Ford.\n\nFord and Farrell played at flyhalf and inside center for England against Tonga on Sunday and Davies might face them both again in Kobe.\n\n\u201cI played against a young Owen Farrell at Saracens,\u201d Davies said in an interview on the Rugby World Cup website. \u201cI also played against George Ford when he was at Leicester. I think George was about 16 and he carved us up.\n\n\u201cGeorge was pinging the ball into the corners, his boot was impeccable, and we thought, \u2018who is this kid?\u2019\n\n\u201cI looked at the team sheet after the game and thought, \u2018I\u2019ll remember that name\u2019. You could tell at that stage those two were going to come through and be something amazing.\u201d\n\nEngland beat the Eagles 28-10 at the 2007 World Cup and it\u2019ll be a tough asker for the U.S. to close that gap this year.\n\n___\n\nU.S. lineup: Will Hooley, Blaine Scully (captain), Marcel Brache, Paul Lasike, Martin Iosefo, AJ MacGinty, Shaun Davies; Cam Dolan, John Quill, Tony Lamborn, Nick Civetta, Ben Landry, Titi Lamositele, Joe Taufete\u2019e, David Ainu\u2019u.
