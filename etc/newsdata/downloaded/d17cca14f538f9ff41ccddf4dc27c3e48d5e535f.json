REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned in August part of an appeals court bribery conviction against Samsung\u2019s de facto chief Jay Y. Lee, who had been given a two-and-a-half-year suspended sentence for seeking favor from South Korea\u2019s former president Park Geun-hye.\n\nThe court said the interpretation by the Seoul High Court on what constituted bribes by Samsung to Park was too narrow.\n\n\u201cThe Seoul High Court is unlikely to make a decision within this year, because prosecutors and his lawyers are fighting harder in this round,\u201d said Jun Ji-hyun, a lawyer who is not involved in the case.\n\nLee, 51, is expected to attend Friday\u2019s hearing, which is required by law for defendants in criminal cases, according to legal experts.\n\nThe case against Lee centered on whether three horses donated by Samsung Group [SAGR.UL] should be considered bribes aimed at winning Park\u2019s favor in the conglomerate\u2019s succession planning. The horses were given to the daughter of Park\u2019s confidante, Choi Seo-won, a professional equestrian.\n\nThe Supreme Court said the appeals court erred in not recognizing the horses as bribes given by Samsung to win favors, raising the possibility of Lee returning to jail.\n\nLee, vice chairman of the group\u2019s crown jewel Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS), has already served one year of detention but walked free last year after the appellate court halved a lower court\u2019s five-year jail sentence and suspended it for three years.\n\nSamsung declined to comment officially.\n\n\u201cWe hope to see the end of this uncertainty as soon as possible,\u201d said a company source who requested anonymity, referring to the legal procedures.\n\nThe trial comes as South Korea\u2019s President Moon Jae-in seeks help from big business leaders to resuscitate a fragile economy, which data showed on Thursday slowed more than expected in the third quarter.\n\nMoon thanked Lee for Samsung\u2019s commitment at a ceremony this month unveiling an $11 billion investment in display technologies.\n\nThe Supreme Court last week closed a separate bribery case involving Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin, allowing him to stay out of jail with a suspended jail sentence.", "description": "A bribery trial involving the heir of South Korea's Samsung Group will start on Friday after the country's top court ruled earlier this year that the case should be reviewed by a lower court, raising the possibility of a tougher sentence.", "authors": ["Heekyong Yang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444409019&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0H3", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
