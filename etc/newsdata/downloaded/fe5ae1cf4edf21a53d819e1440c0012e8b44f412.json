Their real disposable incomes grew 3% year-on-year in the third quarter, the most since 2013.\n\nThe problem is, it\u2019s unclear exactly where the improvement comes from.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin appears to be obsessed with real incomes. It\u2019s a statistic he mentions more frequently than economic growth. Sometimes he argues, as he did in June, that incomes are pulling out of their dive. Sometimes he expresses concern, as he did in August, that they\u2019re not growing. Sometimes he tells the government, as he did last month, that economic growth is only desirable if citizens\u2019 incomes also grow.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that Putin\u2019s worried. Before 2014, his unspoken contract with Russians was more prosperity in exchange for less freedom. The patriotic fever following the Crimea annexation tided Putin over as falling oil prices and sanctions hit the Russian economy. But now that enthusiasm has faded, and Putin fears that popular dissatisfaction could lead to mass protests. When incomes decline, that probability grows.\n\nThat means last week\u2019s report from the Rosstat statistics agency was particularly good news for Putin. It\u2019s a headline number he can proudly cite as proof that his policy of boosting government spending on so-called \u201cnational projects\u201d is already having a beneficial effect on ordinary Russians.\n\nIndependent economists, however, struggled to understand where the unexpectedly big increase might have come from. Central Bank data indicated that the value of loans issued to individuals had been increasing, which would imply downward pressure on disposable incomes from interest payments. Retail sales have been slowing down. And real wages weren\u2019t growing fast enough for such an increase in July and August. Unfortunately, no one knows what wages did in September because Rosstat, contrary to previous practice, didn\u2019t publish those data along with the real disposable income number. \u201cBut wages are a key component of incomes,\u201d Kirill Tremasov, formerly head of the Economics Ministry\u2019s forecasting department, wrote on his Telegram channel. \u201cIf Rosstat has no September estimate for wages, how did it calculate incomes? It seems to me Rosstat is continuing to undermine trust in statistics.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a shame because Pavel Malkov, Rosstat\u2019s current chief who was appointed last December, has said his goal is to strengthen the quality of data collection and analysis. What\u2019s been more noticeable so far are the stronger numbers.\n\nTo address the outstanding questions, Rosstat came out with an explanation: Apart from the \u201clow 2018 base,\u201d the other major reason for the recorded growth in incomes was an increase in \u201cgray\u201d wages \u2014 that is, those paid in cash to avoid taxation. In the first quarter of this year, such unofficial payments made up just 7.8% of Russians\u2019 incomes, but they reached 14.1% in the third quarter, according to the statistics agency.\n\nThis explanation would imply that Russia\u2019s shadow economy is growing. But Rosstat\u2019s own data show that it has been declining steadily relative to Russia\u2019s economic output in recent years, to 12.7% of gross domestic product in 2018 from 13.8% in 2014. There is no reason to expect that Russia\u2019s ever-tightening tax controls have slackened considerably this year. In any case, data on shadow incomes are especially hard to check.\n\nSuch aggressive accounting is a potential headache for economists who use official Russian data for analysis and forecasts. And it doesn\u2019t change the major challenges the government faces in improving standards of living.\n\nRosstat has just released fresh survey data showing how Russians estimate their living standards. In the second quarter of 2019, the share of households that report only having enough money for food and clothes increased to 49.4% from 48.8% a year earlier, though the share of even poorer people, who can only afford food, dropped to 14.1% from 16.1%.\n\nTaken together, these numbers mean almost two thirds of Russians are barely making ends meet and have no way to save. According the edition of Credit Suisse\u2019s Global Wealth Report, a Russian adult\u2019s median wealth amounts to $3,683 compared with $65,904 in the U.S. Russia stands out as the major economy with the most inequality of all. There, the wealthiest accrue some 58% of the country\u2019s wealth, compared to 35% in the U.S.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Russian\u2019s have reason to celebrate, at least according to data published by the national statistics office last week.
