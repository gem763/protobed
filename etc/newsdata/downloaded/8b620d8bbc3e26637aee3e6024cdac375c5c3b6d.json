I didn\u2019t think it would be super easy. But I have come on a few times the past few weeks and was happy to start today, it was a special day.\n\n\u201cThere are young guys in the team but we forget about that when we go out there. It\u2019s a fun team to play with now and we just want to keep this run going.\u201d\n\nBIG PRICE\n\nPulisic, who has scored 14 goals in 34 senior appearances for the U.S., joined Dortmund at youth level in 2015 after netting 20 in 34 for his country\u2019s Under-17 side.\n\nHe turned professional in 2016 and in his first three full seasons at the Bundesliga club, he quickly caught the eye with his electrifying pace and dribbling skills.\n\nBut a wealth of talented forwards at Chelsea meant Pulisic endured a tough start in London, with Lampard explaining that he had shunned the American for a reason after he played for the U.S. in their Gold Cup final defeat by Mexico in July.\n\n\u201cHe had a week\u2019s break this summer. He arrived for a big price and wanted to come straight back in but at the same time why am I going to throw him in?,\u201d Lampard told Sky Sports.\n\n\u201cSo I have to do it in the right way and get the best out of him. I\u2019m delighted for him.\u201d\n\nIf Pulisic\u2019s performance on Saturday is anything to go by, he will leave Lampard spoilt for choice up front after steering Chelsea to their seventh successive win in all competitions.", "description": "Christian Pulisic failed to hit the ground running at Chelsea after finally joining the west London side from Borussia Dortmund but staked a strong claim for a first team spot with a magnificent performance in a 4-2 win at Burnley on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445290684&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P0N4", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
