The \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d star quickly deleted the clip and responded with a pat \u201csorry if you were offended\u201d video, followed by another apology, this time as a note on Instagram, sharing vague promises of near-future self-reflection.\n\nThe flap was surely amplified by Ms. Rodriguez\u2019s checkered track record when it comes to the black community; on multiple occasions in the past couple of years she has been rightly called out for espousing anti-black sentiments and pitting Latinx women and black women against one another.\n\nBut even ignoring Ms. Rodriguez\u2019s history, the incident sheds light on an ugly truth about the unsettling comfort many Latinx people have with saying the N-word and the right they claim to have in using it. It also underscores a complicated dynamic between two marginalized groups, and what it means for them to experience both solidarity with and division from one another.\n\nIn urban neighborhoods across the country \u2014 from Corona, Queens, where I grew up, to Compton, Calif. \u2014 African-Americans and Latinx people live in close quarters, often segregated from whites through institutionalized or historically racist practices. As such, a cultural exchange has emerged naturally over decades, one that exists across local business cooperation, community organizing, cuisines and, notably, lexicon. African-American Vernacular English and Spanish-language slang come together outside the bodega or at the park.", "description": "Many of us assume our proximity to black people makes it O.K. for us to say the word.
