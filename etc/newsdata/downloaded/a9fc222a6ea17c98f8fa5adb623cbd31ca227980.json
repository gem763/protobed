The voters have a choice: getting Brexit done with me, or the pointless delay you\u2019re offering. Name the date. https://t.co/jY88u0Zrb6 \u2014 Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) October 5, 2019\n\n\u201cMPs from every wing of my own Conservative Party, from Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP, even from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s own ranks, have said that our proposed deal looks like one they can get behind,\u201d Mr Johnson said.\n\n\u201cWhere the previous Withdrawal Agreement, backstop and all, drove an almighty wedge through the heart of Parliament, I have heard positive noises from across the House.\u201d\n\nHe said it will be more likely for the EU to accept Britain\u2019s \u201coutstretched hand\u201d and make that \u201cleap on to the island\u201d if he is armed with a set of proposals MPs support.\n\nHe added: \u201cSo I say to our European friends: grasp the opportunity that our new proposal provides. Join us at the negotiating table in a spirit of compromise and co-operation. And let\u2019s make Brexit work for both sides.\n\n\u201cWe are leaving in 25 days. We can do it with a deal if the EU is willing.\n\n\u201cBut they should be under no illusions or misapprehensions. There will be no more dither. No more delay. On October 31 we are going to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nThis mindset was echoed by Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay who wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that the country was \u201capproaching the moment of truth\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe hope the EU will come to the table in the spirit of compromise and match our creativity and flexibility.\n\n\u201cIf they do, we will leave with a new deal. If they shut the door on us, then we are prepared to leave without a deal.\n\n\u201cBut the latter would be in neither side\u2019s interest. It would bring disruption for us, and disruption for the EU.\u201d\n\nAnd Nicky Morgan, who voted Remain and is now culture secretary, wrote in the Observer: \u201cI urge colleagues from across the house to come together in the national interest and look at these proposals seriously.\n\n\u201cThe same applies to the EU \u2013 it needs to look seriously at this proposal, talk to us, and negotiate a deal that works.\n\n\u201cThis is the best chance we have to break the deadlock and leave.\u201d\n\nIrish premier Leo Varadkar gave a glimmer of hope to Mr Johnson as he said a deal could be secured in the next two weeks, but he cautioned the current proposals do not form the basis for \u201cdeeper negotiations\u201d.\n\nLeo Varadkar speaking at a press conference during a Fine Gael fundraising dinner in Dublin (David Young/PA)\n\nSpeaking in Dublin on Saturday evening, Mr Varadkar said next Friday would be a reasonable cut-off point to get a deal done ahead of the following week\u2019s summit in Brussels \u2013 though he added an extra 24 or 48 hours could be made available for last-minute talks.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think a deal is still possible\u2026 It is possible at the European Council summit in two weeks\u2019 time but the current position as of today is the European Union, including Ireland, doesn\u2019t feel that the proposals put forward by Prime Minister Johnson yet form the basis for deeper negotiations.\u201d\n\nElsewhere:\n\n\u2013 The Sunday Times, citing senior aides, said the PM is prepared to \u201csquat\u201d in Downing Street even if MPs declare no confidence in his Government and agree a caretaker prime minister.\n\n\u2013 The Sunday Telegraph reported Mr Johnson could veto the EU\u2019s seven-year budget under a series of proposals being discussed by ministers to \u201csabotage\u201d the bloc\u2019s structures if Brussels refuses to agree a new deal or allow the UK to crash out without one.\n\n\u2013 A poll for the Independent by BMG Research suggested only one in five people believes Mr Johnson can secure a Brexit deal by October 31.\n\n\u2013 Dutch PM Mark Rutte said he spoke to Mr Johnson on Saturday, but \u201cimportant questions remain about the British proposals\u201d.\n\nJust spoke to @BorisJohnson on the phone. Important questions remain about the British proposals. There is a lot of work to be done ahead of #EUCO on October 17/18. \u2014 Mark Rutte (@MinPres) October 5, 2019\n\nThat came after the European Commission said on Friday EU member states agree the proposals \u201cdo not provide a basis for concluding an agreement\u201d.\n\nA spokesman said discussions between the two sides would not take place this weekend, as had been anticipated, and instead the UK will be given \u201canother opportunity to present its proposals in detail\u201d on Monday.\n\nBut the PM has won the backing of former premier David Cameron, who said he \u201ccompletely supports\u201d Mr Johnson\u2019s efforts to get a deal in Europe and take it through the Commons, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s the best thing that could possibly happen.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s insistence that Britain will leave at the end of the month comes after Scotland\u2019s highest civil court heard from UK Government lawyers that Mr Johnson accepts he must send a letter requesting a delay to Brexit beyond the Halloween deadline if no deal is agreed with Parliament by October 19.", "description": "The Prime Minister again insisted Britain will leave the EU on October 31.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/08/wire-19354312-1570346014-484_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
