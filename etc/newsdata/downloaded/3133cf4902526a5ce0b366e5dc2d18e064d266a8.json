He also said the United States and the world economy are not likely to fall into recession.\n\n\u201cThe report showed steadiness in the job market, albeit not a lot of growth. The jobs report gave enough weakness for the Fed to cut 25 basis points this month but not enough that the Fed would start flashing a recession warning,\u201d said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cUntil we get into October and there\u2019s solid company data again, the market\u2019s going to be gyrating based on economic and geopolitical headlines.\u201d\n\nEarlier, China\u2019s central bank said it would slash the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, releasing a total of 900 billion yuan ($126.35 billion) in liquidity to shore up the flagging economy.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 69.45 points, or 0.26%, at 26,797.6, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 2.72 points, or 0.09%, to 2,978.72 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 13.75 points, or 0.17%, at 8,103.07.\n\nFor the week, the S&P 500 rose 1.8%, while the Dow added 1.5% and the Nasdaq gained 1.8%.\n\nOf the S&P 500\u2019s 11 major sectors, eight ended the day with gains. Healthcare .SPXHC was the biggest boost with a 0.3% increase, while the technology sector was the biggest drag with a 0.2% drop.\n\nThe communication services sector .SPLRCL was also under pressure as Facebook Inc (FB.O) slipped 1.8% after U.S. state attorneys general said they would investigate if the social media giant stifled competition and put users at risk.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s nonfarm payroll data showed the economy added 130,000 jobs in August, below expectations for a gain of 158,000, according to a Reuters survey of economists. While average hourly earnings gained 0.4% last month in the largest increase since February, the annual increase dipped to 3.2% from 3.3% in July.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 5, 2019.
