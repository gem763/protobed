Marco Rubio (R-FL) has called for a national security panel to review TikTok owner Beijing ByteDance Technology Co\u2019s purchase of lip-syncing app Musical.ly over fears that the Chinese government is using TikTok to censor political content.\n\nReuters reports that Sen. Marco Rubio has called on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to review the acquisition of social media app Musical.ly by TikTok owner Beijing ByteDance Technology Co. over claims that TikTok is used by the Chinese government to censor certain political content.\n\nRubio stated in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that Chinese-owned apps \u201care increasingly being used to censor content and silence open discussion on topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese Government and Communist Party.\u201d The Treasury secretary heads the CFIUS, which reviews mergers such as that of Musical.ly and TikTok to ensure that they do not damage national security.\n\nRubio stated that there was evidence that TikTok in the United States was censoring political content that was \u201cnot in line\u201d with the Chinese government. Rubio stated that China \u201cis using these apps to advance their foreign policy and globally suppress freedom of speech, expression, and other freedoms that we as Americans so deeply cherish.\u201d In one example, TikTok has blacklisted popular Christian app pray.com from advertising on its app.\n\nA spokesperson for TikTok clarified tha the firm stores all of its U.S. user data in the United States. \u201cThe Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content, and would not have jurisdiction regardless, as TikTok does not operate there,\u201d the spokesperson stated.\n\nDavid Hanke, an attorney with Arent Fox who helped craft a legislative overhaul of the committee last year, stated that \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be shocking, but it would be atypical,\u201d for CFIUS to review the merger. He added: \u201cIt also would not be the first time CFIUS has blazed new trails over China-specific concerns.\u201d\n\nByteDance purchased Musical.ly for almost $1 billion in December 2017, eventually shutting the app down and revamping its own TikTok app to replace it. The company\u2019s original app is called Douyin and is similar to TikTok but is only available in China where it complies with local censorship laws.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
