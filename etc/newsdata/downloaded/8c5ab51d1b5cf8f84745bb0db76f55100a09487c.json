The building remained open and was not evacuated. Capital Police said in the incident was resolved just before 10am.\n\nIt came as Supreme Court justices were set to wade into a major LGBT rights dispute over whether a landmark decades-old federal civil rights law protects gay and transgender people from job discrimination.\n\nTwo of three related cases will be heard by Supreme Court justices on Tuesday.\n\nThe Supreme Court is preparing to wade into a major LGBT rights dispute over whether a landmark decades-old federal civil rights law protects gay and transgender people from job discrimination\n\nThe cases are the court's first on LGBT rights since Justice Anthony Kennedy retired and was replaced by Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nAt issue is whether gay and transgender people are protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex as well as race, color, national origin and religion.\n\nA ruling for employees who were fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity would have a big impact for the estimated 8.1 million LGBT workers across the country because most states don't protect them from workplace discrimination.\n\nThe Supreme Court delivered an important gay rights decision in 2015 legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide but its dynamics on LGBT issues changed following Kennedy's retirement last year.\n\nThe cases are the court's first on LGBT rights since Justice Anthony Kennedy retired and was replaced by Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Kennedy was a voice for gay rights and the author of the landmark ruling in 2015 that made same-sex marriage legal throughout the United States\n\nKennedy was a voice for gay rights and the author of the landmark ruling in 2015 that made same-sex marriage legal throughout the United States.\n\nKavanaugh, who generally is regarded as more conservative, could provide a pivotal vote.\n\nThe Trump administration has changed course from the Obama administration and now supports the employers in arguing that the civil rights law's Title 7 does not prohibit discrimination because of sexual orientation or transgender status.\n\nThe legal fight will focus on the definition of 'sex' in Title VII.\n\nA decision is expected by early summer 2020, amid the presidential election campaign.\n\nPeople have been waiting in line outside the court since the weekend to try to snag the few seats the court makes available to the public for arguments.\n\nThe justices will first hear appeals in lawsuits filed by Gerald Bostock, who claims he lost his job working for Clayton County, Georgia, after he began playing in a gay recreational softball league. He lost his case in federal district court and at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.\n\nThe US Supreme Court on Tuesday will hear three cases concerning protections for LGBTQ employees, two of them involving gay men Gerald Bostock (left) and Donald Zarda (right)\n\nThe third case involves Aimee Stephens, 58, who says she was fired from a Michigan funeral home in 2013 for being transgender\n\nSkydiving instructor Donald Zarda was fired shortly after telling a woman he was preparing to take on a dive that he was gay. Zarda, who worked for Altitude Express on New York's Long Island, said he would sometimes reveal his sexual orientation to allay concerns women might have about being strapped together during a dive.\n\nZarda initially lost his lawsuit, but the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for him. Zarda has since died.\n\nThe other case involves fired transgender funeral home director Aimee Stephens. She lost her job when she told Thomas Rost, owner of the Detroit-area R.G. and G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, that she had struggled with gender identity issues almost her whole life.\n\nShe was planning to exchange the dark suit and tie she had worn to work for nearly six years as an embalmer and funeral director for a conservative dress or skirt that was required for women who worked for Rost.\n\nRost told Stephens her plan wouldn't work and let her go. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued on her behalf and, after losing in a district court, won a ruling in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati.\n\nA couple of hundred demonstrators advocating for LGBT rights gathered a short distance from the white marble courthouse on Tuesday ahead of the hearing.\n\nThey chanted for equal rights and held signs including ones that read, 'Do fire Trump. Don't fire LGBTQ workers,' 'Discrimination is bad for business' and 'LGBT Americans power our economy'.\n\nDuring the Obama years, the EEOC had changed its longstanding interpretation of civil rights law to include discrimination against LGBT people. The law prohibits discrimination because of sex, but has no specific protection for sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe Trump administration and the employers say Congress could easily settle the matter by amending Title 7 to include LGBT people. Legislation to that effect is pending in Congress, but is not likely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nBut the workers contend, and the lower courts that have ruled for them have reasoned, that the law as it stands plainly covers sexual orientation and gender identity because discrimination against them is based on generalizations about sex that have nothing to do with their ability to do their jobs.\n\nThey also argue that they were fired for not conforming to sex stereotypes, a form of sex discrimination that the Supreme Court recognized 30 years ago.", "description": "The Supreme Court says two suspicious packages were found near the court on Tuesday morning just before the justices were to hear arguments over LGBT rights.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/15/19447642-0-image-a-38_1570546371086.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
