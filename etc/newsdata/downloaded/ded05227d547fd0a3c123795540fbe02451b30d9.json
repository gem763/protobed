General Assembly in New York.\n\nAsked about the prospect, Trump told White House reporters anything was possible. \"Sure, anything's possible. They would like to be able to solve their problem,\" he said, referring to inflation in Iran. \"We could solve it in 24 hours.\"\n\nThe moves have suggested Iran, the United States and European powers may be leaving the door open for diplomacy to resolve a dispute over Iran's nuclear work, which the West has suspected was aimed at developing a nuclear weapon, even as they largely stuck to entrenched positions.\n\nIran denies ever having sought a nuclear bomb.\n\nAt the press conference with Esper, British defense minister Ben Wallace said Britain will always help the United States along a path to talks with Iran if a deal can be made, but Iran should be judged by its actions rather than words.\n\nA senior U.S. defense official said Esper and his French counterpart will discuss on Saturday how France's navy could coordinate with Washington to ensure freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nIran said on Friday it had taken a step to further downgrade its commitments to the 2015 deal with the world's most powerful nations, according to Iranian media, in retaliation for U.S. sanctions reimposed on Tehran.\n\n\"We continue to believe that we need to be enforcing our sanctions to the maximum extent possible,\" the U.S. official said when asked about Iran's decision to start developing centrifuges to speed up its uranium enrichment.\n\nGermany, one of the signatories to the deal, reacted to Iran's decision on the centrifuges by saying it was not too late for Iran to change course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali.
