The Government effectively abandoned calling a vote on Saturday, leaving Speaker John Bercow to decide whether to permit a second try.\n\nAs ministers said they believed they had the numbers to win the vote:\n\nTory former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd pledged to back the deal;\n\nOliver Letwin, who was behind the amendment that sank Saturday's meaningful vote, also gave his support;\n\nTory rebel Rory Stewart suggested he would vote for a customs union;\n\nBrussels indicated it would delay a decision on an extension until it was clear whether Mr Johnson would win;\n\nScottish judges will hear a legal challenge this morning on whether the Prime Minister broke the law by telling EU leaders he did not want a delay;\n\nMichael Gove said he was triggering Operation Yellowhammer plans to handle a No Deal Brexit.\n\nThe Prime Minister will publish the Withdrawal Agreement Bill today under the assumption that the Commons starts voting on it tomorrow.\n\nBut Keir Starmer warned that opposition MPs were preparing dozens of amendments that could effectively wreck the legislation.\n\nKeir Starmer warned that opposition MPs were preparing dozens of amendments that could effectively wreck the legislation (pictured: Sir Keir on The Andrew Marr show on Sunday)\n\nLabour's Brexit spokesman said the party would order its MPs to support efforts on forcing a second referendum; on staying in the customs union; and on blocking No Deal if trade talks fail by the end of the transition period.\n\nA No 10 source said Labour should come clean: 'Do MPs want to respect the referendum like they claim to and leave the EU with a good new deal on October 31?\n\n'Or, as with Labour's torturous policies on a customs union or a second referendum, do they want to frustrate and cancel Brexit altogether?'\n\nThe support of the DUP could allow the customs union amendment to pass. Its Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson yesterday warned Mr Johnson the votes of its MPs were 'crucial on the issue of Brexit'.\n\nHe said the DUP 'does not seek a second referendum' but a Brexit where the UK leaves 'as one nation'. This opened the door to supporting the plan to keep the whole of the UK in the customs union, rather than creating separate arrangements for Northern Ireland.\n\nBrexiteers oppose the move because it would restrict Britain's ability to strike independent trade deals.\n\nSir Keir yesterday suggested Labour and the DUP could work together. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he said: 'I would openly invite the DUP to talk to us.\n\n'If you want to work with us to improve the situation we're in, our door is open to that discussion.'\n\nSome of 21 rebel former Tories, including former chancellors Philip Hammond and Ken Clarke, could back the customs union plan. Mr Clarke tabled a similar proposal that was narrowly by just three votes in April.\n\nGloria De Piero, a Labour MP who Mr Johnson had hoped would back his deal, also signalled her support.\n\nShe tweeted: 'A customs union amendment is what I'll be working for. I am convinced we can get majority support for it. It would enable us to stay true to the Labour manifesto every Labour MP was elected on.'\n\nJohn McDonnell told Sky News on Sunday that the second referendum amendment would have a better chance of success if it was tabled by backbenchers\n\nSir Keir added: 'I suspect there'll be dozens of amendments put down this week. We will work through all of them, we will decide which ones we're supporting.\n\n'We've been arguing for a very long time now for a customs union with the EU and for single market alignment.\n\n'There are other amendments that are really important because there is a trap door to No Deal at the end of 2020 that we need to deal with and close.\n\n'And of course we need an amendment to say that whatever deal gets through it should be subject to a referendum where that deal is put to the public and they're asked, 'Do you want to leave on these terms of would you rather remain in the EU?' So this week's going to be busy.'\n\nSteve Baker, the leader of the European Research Group of Brexiteer Tory MPs, has suggested they could remove their support for Mr Johnson's deal if it was significantly amended.\n\nHe urged the group to support the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and 'vote for it through to completion provided that that legislation is not wrecked'.", "description": "A No 10 source said Labour should come clean: 'Do MPs want to respect the referendum like they claim to and leave the EU with a good new deal on October 31?'", "authors": ["John Stevens Deputy Political Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/21/19965374-0-image-a-79_1571604451411.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
