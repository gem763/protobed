One land would focus on the founding fathers while others would feature a 20th century farm, world war battlefields, factories of the industrial revolution. The park would also cover some potentially controversial topics too, like turn-of-the-century immigration, Native Americans, and slavery.\n\nDisney\u2019s new park would be state-of-the-art amusement while mixing in education and sensitivity towards the \u201cpainful, disturbing, and agonizing\u201d aspects of American history. Attendees could expect VR technology, innovative motion-simulators, next generation animatronics, and a nightly ironclad ship battle between the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia.\n\nBut less than a year after the big unveiling, on September 28, 1994, Disney pulled the plug on the project after facing months of intense national and local backlash. Fears ranged from unbearable traffic, the company\u2019s growing power, and Disney\u2019s ability to sensitively portray the complexities of U.S. history.\n\nWhile the park never came to be, concept art and patent applications give us a good idea what kinds of attractions would be built near Haymarket, Virginia.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of missed opportunities and a lot of cool things could have happened,\u201d says Jim Hill, Disney historian and host of the long-running podcast The Disney Dish.\n\nBut just because \u201cDisney\u2019s America\u201d was no more, that didn\u2019t mean all that innovation should be lost to history. \u201cEisner was looking at millions upon millions of dollars that have been spent on development,\u201d says Hill, \u201cAnd he wanted some of that money back.\u201d\n\nFor a company worth tens of billions of dollars, what would have Disney\u2019s America looked like is one of the greatest what-ifs in The Walt Disney Company\u2019s history. But many of the park\u2019s proposed marquee attractions inspired or, even, were repurposed for use in other Disney parks.\n\nHere\u2019s where you still can get a glimpse of the attractions that never were at Disney\u2019s forgotten American history theme park.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cs.3HSGzuJf6GxBwVgUvhg--~B/aD0xOTIwO3c9NDk0NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/7d825a89b0050708eadafe470e628864", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
