REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Global financial regulators have no plan to ban Facebook\u2019s Libra or other stablecoins, but these digital tokens backed by official currencies will have to meet the highest regulatory standards, European Central Bank director Benoit Coeure said in an interview published on Thursday.\n\nHis comments provide a rare ray of light for Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency plans, which have been widely criticized by regulators and politicians since the social media group unveiled the currency in June.\n\n\u201cThere is certainly no judgment that stablecoins shouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d Coeure told Bloomberg News.\n\nEuropean policymakers have voiced strong opposition to Libra, with France pledging to block its launch in Europe over worries about its impact of financial stability and its potential to undermine monetary sovereignty.\n\nBut Coeure, who is French, was more constructive.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Europe, neither the Commission nor the ECB intend to make Europe a no-fly zone for stablecoins. But stablecoins will have to meet the highest regulatory standards and adhere to broader public policy goals,\u201d he said.\n\nLibra\u2019s backers pledged to forge ahead with the project on Monday, shrugging off the defection of seven of its founding members, including major payments firms Visa and Mastercard, amid the regulatory criticism.\n\nLibra said the digital currency\u2019s regulatory issues could push back its launch date, planned for the end of June next year.\n\nOn Thursday, Coeure is due to present the recommendations of a G7 taskforce on stablecoins to finance ministers from the world\u2019s seven largest economies gathering in Washington for the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meetings.", "description": "Global financial regulators have no plan to ban Facebook's Libra or other stablecoins, but these digital tokens backed by official currencies will have to meet the highest regulatory standards, European Central Bank director Benoit Coeure said in an interview published on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441838949&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0UH", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
