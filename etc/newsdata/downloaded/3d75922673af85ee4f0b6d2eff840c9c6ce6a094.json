Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire Democrat, said a visit from Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan would be unthinkable. His forces are bombarding American-allied Kurdish fighters in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull a few dozen U.S. troops from key buffer zones along the Turkey-Syria border.\n\n\u201cPresident Erdogan needs to hear an unequivocal message of opposition to his incursion,\u201d she said. \u201cPresident Trump must publicly revoke his invitation until Turkey pulls back from its current course. It makes no sense to be extending hospitality and niceties while President Erdogan refuses to heed international calls for a ceasefire.\u201d\n\nAmong Republicans, Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois told CBS that Mr. Erdogan should \u201cabsolutely not\u201d come to the White House, and Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas said the Turkish leader \u201cshould not visit the White House until his forces stand down.\u201d\n\nSo far, the White House hasn\u2019t withdrawn the Nov. 13 invite.\n\nPress Secretary Stephanie Grisham responded to an inquiry by saying there are no scheduling announcements on the visit \u201cat this time.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump is imposing economic sanctions on Turkey and cutting off trade talks with Ankara amid the fallout from his troop withdrawal.\n\nHe is also dispatching a high-level delegation led by Vice President Mike Pence to Turkey this week to try and work out a deal, as Congress considers more far-reaching sanctions.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, Connecticut Democrat, said Congress should tie Turkish sanctions to a long-running push to require Mr. Trump and presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns. It\u2019s not uncommon for Mr. Trump\u2019s critics to argue that his vast business portfolio is creating conflicts of interest.\n\n\u201cCongress has a responsibility to get to the bottom of why Trump made this surprise decision last Sunday night,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.\n\nThe senator also wants to alleviate the \u201chumanitarian nightmare\u201d in the region by allowing more Kurdish refugees into the U.S. and helping Iraq accept an influx, too.\n\nMr. Murphy said any economic punishment on Turkey should be thoughtful and targeted.\n\n\u201cThis means passing only those sanctions necessary to encourage the prospective behaviors we want Turkey to engage in. Sanctions to simply punish them for actions that the president of the United States invited them to take makes no strategic sense,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth Mr. Murphy and Mrs. Shaheen said a lot of damage has already been inflicted on the region.\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s incursion into Northeastern Syria, which President Trump allowed to happen, has led to a worst case scenario in the region that I have long feared,\u201d Mrs. Shaheen said. \u201cISIS fighters are now pouring out of prisons, the Assad regime and Russia are filling the security vacuum left by retreating U.S. troops, and our partners, the Syrian Democratic Forces, are experiencing a brutal onslaught.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
