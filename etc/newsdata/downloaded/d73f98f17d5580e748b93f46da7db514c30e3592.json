So we can end up leaving the EU much earlier.\n\nIf the deal doesn't get through, then it's in the hands of 27 EU leaders who'd have to agree unanimously at an emergency summit.\n\nThey can either choose to refuse a delay - forcing a no-deal Brexit at 11pm on Halloween - or grant one even though Boris Johnson doesn't want it.\n\nWhen will the PM try to get his Brexit deal through?\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe Government is set to bring the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation needed for Brexit - to the Commons on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, time is running out before the October 31 deadline because the European Parliament would also need to ratify it.\n\nAnd the Bill would have to pass through MPs' first vote (which still isn't guaranteed), dozens of amendments including for a customs union and second referendum, and the pro-Remain House of Lords.\n\nMinisters could try to hold extra late-night or weekend sittings in Parliament (yes, again) to get the legislation through.\n\nSeparately, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Government wants to hold another meaningful vote on Mr Johnson's deal on Monday.\n\nThis wouldn't be a final decision but it would indicate if he has the numbers.\n\nCommons Speaker John Bercow said he would consider whether to allow the Government's plans.\n\nWill the Brexit deal pass in the Commons?\n\n(Image: Kiran Ridley)\n\nThe vote is on a knife-edge.\n\nIn the current hung Parliament, much will hinge on the PM securing support from Brexiteer Tories who voted down Theresa May's deal on three occasions, plus the 21 former Conservatives who lost the whip over the issue of a no deal Brexit .\n\nFormer Tory cabinet minister Amber Rudd has indicated she would support Mr Johnson's deal and thought there was a \"coalition for getting the Prime Minister's deal through\".\n\nHowever, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he believes the Government does have enough backing, telling The Andrew Marr Show: \"We seem to have the numbers in the House of Commons\".\n\nThe DUP is strongly opposed to Mr Johnson's deal due to the arrangements for Northern Ireland, so the backing of enough Labour MPs in Leave supporting seats will also be vital.\n\nDoes Boris Johnson want a delay?\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nDespite asking for one, no, he doesn't.\n\nThe Prime Minister sent a a legally-required request to the EU to delay until January 31, deal or no deal, after a vote in Parliament and a law called the 'Benn Act' forced him to.\n\nBut he refused to sign the letter and sent a second signed note which branded an extension \"corrosive\".\n\nThat means even though he's legally asked for a delay, politically, EU leaders must choose to listen either to him or to the UK Parliament. Tough choice.\n\nWill the EU agree to an extension?\n\nIt's widely thought EU leaders would agree an extension to avoid no-deal despite doubts raised by French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nHowever, it seems we won't get a decision straight away.\n\nThe Guardian reported the EU would wait and see how things pan out in Parliament before announcing how to proceed.\n\nIf the PM gets the Bill through, there could be a special gathering of EU leaders on October 28.\n\nIf the deal needs more time at that stage to get through Parliament, leaders could agree to a short \"technical\" extension.\n\nWould any delay definitely be three months?\n\nNo, not necessarily.\n\nFirst of all, an extension - however long - ends once a Brexit deal is ratified. So if it's all done 10 days into the period, Brexit can happen then.\n\nSecondly, EU leaders could decide a different length to an extension, either shorter or longer than the three-month one cited in the Benn Act.\n\nOne ally of Angela Merkel suggested it should be much longer to avoid having to just extend again from January 31.\n\nWill Boris Johnson be forced to accept an extension?\n\nYes - if MPs do not vote it down in Parliament.\n\nThat is, at least, according to the terms of the Benn Act which the PM could try to subvert or somehow get around.\n\nWhy did a \"meaningful vote\" on the Brexit deal not go ahead on Saturday?\n\nMPs voted by a majority of 16 to back an amendment put forward by former Cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin to withhold approval of the latest deal agreed between Mr Johnson and Brussels \"unless and until implementing legislation is passed\".\n\nSir Oliver, who lost the Tory whip for voting against the Government on Brexit previously, said the amendment was \"insurance\" against the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal by mistake on the scheduled deadline of October 31.\n\nAfter he lost the vote, the Prime Minister decided not to have the so-called \"meaningful vote\" on his deal.", "description": "Boris Johnson is insisting Brexit will still happen on October 31 despite asking the EU for a delay.
