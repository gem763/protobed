We don't ask foreign governments to help us in our elections.\"\n\nPelosi was due to meet with all House of Representatives Democrats later on Tuesday to map out a way forward after the nation's top spy officials refused to hand over a complaint from an intelligence whistleblower that reportedly deals with a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nPelosi said it was clear that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was breaking the law in withholding the complaint from Congress at the direction of the Trump administration.\n\n\"It's really unfortunate,\" she said.\n\nPelosi, however, declined to say what the next steps might be from the House as Democratic lawmakers try to force the administration to hand over the complaint.
