The unemployment rate is very low; store windows are plastered with help wanted signs.\n\nBut for millions of Americans, one job is not enough.\n\nBridget Hughes, 29, works a regular day shift at a Burger King in Kansas City, Mo. Three nights a week, she also works the overnight shift at a nearby McDonald\u2019s. She makes $10 an hour at Burger King and $9.50 an hour at McDonald\u2019s and, together with her husband\u2019s job at a gas station, they manage to feed their three children and to pay the rent.\n\n\u201cWhen I thought of my future, I thought I was going to be at football games and soccer practices and cheerleading, when in all actuality I\u2019m lucky if I\u2019m home for birthdays,\u201d Ms. Hughes said. \u201cAnd my children, they think if mommy is at work all the time then we should have the money. But the reality is that I\u2019m at work all the time and I don\u2019t have the money.\u201d\n\nMore than eight million people \u2014 roughly 5 percent of all workers \u2014 held more than one job at a time in July, according to the most recent federal data.
