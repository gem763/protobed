The LAPD and the National Sheriffs Association made similar statements.\n\nLike Waze, Google Maps' new feature doesn't let users distinguish between different types of police operations to report. The only incident label related to law enforcement that's available in the new Maps update is \"speed trap.\"\n\nA Google spokesperson told Business Insider that the company believes the feature helps make roads safer, arguing that \"informing drivers about upcoming speed traps allows them to be more careful and make safer decisions when they're on the road.\"\n\nThe new feature will roll out for all iPhone and Android users this week.", "description": "Google Maps is rolling out a new feature that will let users with any type of smartphone easily report the location of police speed traps.", "authors": ["Aaron Holmes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da9bb624af9090b1d022d23?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
