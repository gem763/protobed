Wine, weather, and entertainment apps were also found to be fraudulent.\n\nSome of the apps, unfortunately, were spotted in Top 100 lists and had been rated over 100,000 times, revealing how entrenched the fake apps were in the repositories.\n\nThe applications impersonated genuine content in both stores and could also be downloaded outside of the App Store and Google Play. In Android's case, users would be directed to an APK file, but when it comes to iOS, external downloaders would simply be directed back to the App Store.\n\nCNET: Hackers set up a fake veteran-hiring website to infect victims with malware\n\nOnce downloaded and installed, the apps would, at first, behave normally. However, each app contained a 'switch' in which fraudsters could set an app to show its true gambling content.\n\nTrend Micro believes it is this API that was switched off during review processes, allowing them to pass inspection.\n\nA connection between some of the fraudulent apps was found via a command-and-control (C2) server. The C2 controlled at least three of the applications and when researchers tried to access it, they accidentally shut down the \"switch\" which loaded the malicious content in the run-of-the-mill apps -- and therefore, the apps began to behave normally.\n\n\"At the time of our research, these apps only seem to use WebView to load a gambling website, and do nothing malicious on the device,\" Trend Micro says. \"However, fake as these apps may be, they still outranked the apps they impersonated.\"\n\nTechRepublic: Latest research says organizations need to integrate security principles with DevOps\n\nApple and Google were notified of the researcher's findings and every fake app has been removed from the App Store and Google Play. ZDNet has reached out to Apple and Google and will update if we hear back.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
