Gavin Newsom has not said whether he will sign the bill. But the NCAA Board Of Governors is already urging him not to, warning that if he does California colleges and universities would eventually be banned from NCAA competitions because of their \u201cunfair recruiting advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would erase the critical distinction between college and professional athletics,\u201d the Board of Governors said in a letter to Newsom. \u201cThese outcomes are untenable and would negatively impact more than 24,000 California student-athletes across three divisions.\u201d\n\nThe state Assembly and Senate sent the bill to the governor without a dissenting vote in what Republican Assemblyman Kevin Kiley said was \u201ca loud and clear message to the NCAA.\u201d Several Republican senators noted they had planned to vote against the bill but changed their minds after listening to the debate and, in some cases, lobbying from their children.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those situations where I think we need to blaze the trail,\u201d said Republican Sen. Jeff Stone, who said his daughter played water polo in college.\n\nNewsom has 30 days to either sign the bill, veto it or let it become law without his signature.\n\nDonald Remy, the NCAA\u2019s chief operating officer and chief legal officer, said their letter to Newsom \u201cis not intended to be a threat at all\u201d but is \u201ca reflection about the way California is going about this.\u201d\n\nThe NCAA believes the bill is unconstitutional because it violates the federal Commerce Clause , and would consider challenging the bill in court if it becomes law. But Democratic Sen. Nancy Skinner, who authored the bill, called that \u201ca hollow threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is meant to scare us,\u201d she said.\n\nThe bill would allow student-athletes to hire agents and be paid for the use of their names, images or likenesses. It would stop California universities and the NCAA from banning athletes that take the money. But it would forbid athletes from signing endorsement deals that conflict with their school\u2019s existing contracts. If it becomes law, it would take effect Jan. 1, 2023.\n\nThe Senate voted 39-0 Wednesday to pass the bill, which has the endorsement of NBA superstar LeBron James, who skipped college and went directly to the NBA before the league changed its rules to require players to be at least one year removed from high school before entering the draft. But the bill could impact James\u2019 14-year-old son, who is a closely watched basketball prospect in Los Angeles.\n\nThe NCAA is the top governing body for college sports. Membership is voluntary. Athletes can get valuable scholarships, but the NCAA has long banned paying athletes to preserve the academic missions of colleges and universities.\n\nBut college sports have since morphed into a multibillion-dollar industry, igniting a debate over the fairness of not paying the industry\u2019s most visible labor force.\n\nEarlier this year, NCAA President Mark Emmert told lawmakers that passing the bill would be premature, noting the NCAA has a committee led by Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith and Big East Commissioner Val Ackerman that is exploring the issue. Their report is due in October.\n\nThe NCAA committee has already said it won\u2019t endorse a plan to pay athletes as if they were employees, but the organization could ease limits on endorsement deals for athletes. The NCAA already lets athletes accept money in some instances. Tennis players can accept up to $10,000 in prize money, and Olympians can accept winnings from their competitions.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Holly Mitchell went to high school with Reggie Miller, who played basketball at UCLA before embarking on an 18-year career in the NBA. Mitchell said she believes Miller\u2019s sister, Cheryl Miller, was the better basketball player but her professional options were limited after her collegiate career at USC that included two national championships.\n\n\u201cThis is also a gender parity issue for women athletes at the collegiate level to benefit financially when they don\u2019t have the same opportunities as their male counterparts,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nIn and around California, schools and conferences believe this legislation might not be the best solution.\n\nThe Pac-12, which includes USC, UCLA, Stanford and Cal, issued a statement reiterating its previous stance \u2014 asking the California Legislature to delay the debate until the NCAA announces formal proposals.\n\n\u201cThe question is what\u2019s the best way to continue to support our student-athletes. We think having more information and informed views will be helpful,\u201d the statement said.\n\nJ.D. Wicker, the athletic director at San Diego State, a Mountain West Conference member, agreed, saying \u201cCalifornia weighing in on this complicates that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the frustration for me is that they probably don\u2019t truly understand the NCAA and how we work as a governing body,\u201d Wicker said. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s schools across 50 states and it\u2019s all of us working together, whereas the state of California will only harm California schools.\u201d", "description": "Athletes at California colleges could hire agents and sign endorsement deals under a bill the state Legislature sent to the governor on Wednesday, setting up...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR150_stanfo_ZG_20190911195050.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
