The comments came after a quarter of Libra's initial members, including major payments firms Visa and Mastercard, abandoned the project.\n\nLibra is a so-called stablecoin, differing from most other cryptocurrencies in that it will be backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities.\n\nThe structure is intended to foster trust and stabilize the price volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies and renders them impractical for commerce and payments.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Wilson; Editing by Pravin Char)", "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - The risks posed by cryptocurrencies such as Facebook's Libra must be addressed before any launch, a senior Bank of France official said on Tuesday, adding to a chorus of regulatory scepticism that threatens to derail the project.", "authors": ["Tom Wilson"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
