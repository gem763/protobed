REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\n\u201cIn the absence of agreed alternative arrangements, no backstop is no deal for us,\u201d Varadkar said ahead of talks with his British counterpart, Boris Johnson.\n\n\u201cAll it does is kick the can down the road for another 14 months; another 14 months of uncertainty for business, another 14 months of uncertainty for people north and south of the border. So that\u2019s not an option that we find attractive at all.\u201d\n\nVaradkar said he would not replace a legal guarantee for the Irish backstop, an insurance agreement to prevent the return of border controls between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, without an specific alternative.\n\n\u201cWhat we cannot do and will not do, and I know you understand this is agree to the replacement of a legal guarantee with a promise,\u201d the Irish PM said. He also said a no-deal Brexit would usher in years of negotiations.\n\n\u201cIn my view, the story of Brexit won\u2019t end if the United Kingdom ends [exits] the European Union on Oct.31 or even Jan. 31,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a clean break or just getting it done. Rather we\u2019ll just move on to a new phase.\u201d\n\nHe said if there was no deal, Britain and the EU would have to get back to negotiations quite quickly to address citizens rights, financial settlement and the Irish border, all issues which had been included in Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal deal.\n\nHe warned even if a deal was struck, agreeing a future free trade agreement would be a \u201cHerculean\u201d task for Johnson.\n\n\u201cWe do want to be your friend and your ally, your \u2018Athena\u2019 in doing so. And I think the manner in which you leave the European Union will determine whether that\u2019s possible,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he was ready to listen to how they could end the impasse, but both leaders said a breakthrough was not likely on Monday.", "description": "Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Monday that the removal of the border backstop without any proper replacement would mean a no-deal Brexit for the United Kingdom.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427894992&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880U4", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
