If we believe in what she's preaching, believing in ourselves & our own voices is something we thought she'd understand,\" Justin Raisen wrote.\n\nLizzo is currently selling T-shirts on her website that read \"100% that bitch \" \u2014 the line created by Lioness (She didn't immediately reply to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment).\n\n\"If Ricky and Lizzo's team decide to settle this dispute with us, we would like to share some of the proceeds with Mina for her influence on Healthy,\" Justin Raisen wrote.", "description": "A pair of songwriting siblings are claiming they deserve writing credit for Lizzo's massive hit Truth Hurts, saying it borrows from her earlier track Healthy, which they co-wrote.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5323186.1571252189!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/lizzo-in-concert-philadelphia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
