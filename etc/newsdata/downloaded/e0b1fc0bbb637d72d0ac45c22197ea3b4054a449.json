(And I quit).\u201d\n\nTaylor also warned in a text message one day later that the aid holdup was straining U.S. relations with Ukraine, saying: \u201cWith the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. This is my nightmare scenario.\u201d\n\nA West Point and Harvard alum, Taylor has a long record of public service. In 2006, Taylor served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine for three years. Following the ousting of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch earlier this year, Taylor was tapped to serve as charg\u00e9 d'affaires for Ukraine.\n\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi Subramanian (Raja) Raja KrishnamoorthiSondland could provide more clues on Ukraine controversy Trump's cruelty toward immigrants weakens rather than strengthens America Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Better Medicare Alliance \u2014 Federal judge blocks Trump from detaining migrant children indefinitely | Health officials tie vaping-related illnesses to 'Dank Vapes' brand | Trump to deliver health care speech in Florida MORE (D-Ill.) said the text messages between Volker, Sondland and Taylor also mention phone calls. Democrats hope to learn more about those communications during Taylor\u2019s deposition.\n\nPhilip Reeker\n\nDemocrats are interested in talking to Reeker, the acting Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, because other evidence suggests he might have heard about a campaign to discredit Yovanovitch.\n\nReeker, a career diplomat, is scheduled to testify Wednesday, a week after longtime State Department official George Kent.\n\nThe State Department inspector general provided Congress with documents earlier this month that, according to reports, showed Kent raised concerns to his superiors at State, including Reeker, that he feared there was a \u201cclassic disinformation operation\u201d being carried out against Yovanovitch.\n\nReeker has nearly three decades of experience in the foreign service, according to his State Department biography. He also formerly served as the U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia from 2008 to 2011 and has received multiple awards for his work in public service.\n\nWhite House official Michael Duffey\n\nDuffey is a key figure in the administration\u2019s decision to withhold aid from Ukraine and the one political appointee in next week\u2019s mix.\n\nThe Trump administration gave Duffey, the associate director of national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget, the authority to stall Ukraine aid after career civil servants in the White House raised concerns that they did not have the legal power to delay such funds, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDuffey\u2019s role in signing off on apportionments is considered odd, the Journal reported, as sources described the responsibility as one that is typically handled by career officers who have years of experience and intimate knowledge of the funding process.\n\nThe matter of the stalled aid is being scrutinized by multiple House committees.\n\nDuffey, who is the second witness lined up to testify Wednesday, has also held various Pentagon posts and he has previous experience working on political campaigns, including serving as the Wisconsin state director in 2008 for the late Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainCummings to lie in state at the Capitol Elizabeth Warren should concern Donald Trump 'bigly' Lawmakers toast Greta Van Susteren's new show MORE (R-Ariz.), according to his biography.\n\nDefense official Laura Cooper\n\nDemocrats are slated to hear from Cooper, a top Pentagon official, on Thursday.\n\nCooper, the deputy assistant secretary, has a nearly two-decade career of public service, including policy areas in Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, according to her Department of Defense biography.\n\nCooper was originally slated to testify Friday, but her closed-door deposition was moved to the following week for unclear reasons.\n\nA spokesman for the House Intelligence Committee declined to comment on the committee\u2019s interest in Cooper\u2019s testimony, but some Democrats remarked that such witnesses are helpful for building a deep understanding of how things work behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cAs a prosecutor, what we would do is we would sort of interview as many witnesses as we can before we ask major players for interviews,\u201d said Rep. Ted Lieu Ted W. LieuHere's what to watch this week on impeachment Testimony from GOP diplomat complicates Trump defense Lawmakers, social media users praise photo of Pelosi confronting Trump MORE (D-Calif.) on Wednesday. \u201cThat's generally what you would do in an investigation.\"\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the director for European affairs at the National Security Council (NSC), is also set to testify Thursday.\n\nFiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former top Russia adviser, told House investigators that Giuliani circumvented NSC staff and other career diplomats while overseeing a \u201cshadow foreign policy\u201d on Ukraine that she claimed aimed to help the president politically, according to reports.\n\nSondland, one of the Trump officials who has come under scrutiny for his role in the Ukraine pressure campaign, has pushed back against reports of Hill\u2019s closed-door testimony that he didn\u2019t keep the NSC and State Department apprised of his work on Ukraine policy.\n\nBut Sondland and Hill are said to have conflicting accounts on several matters.\n\nAdditionally, Vindman makes an appearance in Sondland\u2019s opening remarks that he delivered to House investigators Thursday. He describes Vindman as one of the few officials who attended the new Ukraine president\u2019s inauguration as part of the U.S. delegation led by Energy Secretary Rick Perry James (Rick) Richard PerryWhite House staggers after tumultuous 48 hours Perry won't comply with subpoena in impeachment inquiry Overnight Energy: Trump taps deputy energy secretary to replace Perry | Praises pick Dan Brouillette as 'total professional' | Perry denies quid pro quo over Ukraine MORE.\n\nFreshman Rep.

He is pushing but feel free as well,\u201d Sondland wrote to the two other U.S. diplomats. The message came after Volker notified the text group that he had placed a \u201ccall into Fiona\u2019s replacement\u201d and would call Bolton \u201cif needed\u201d to relay the fact that Giuliani supported a Trump-Zelensky phone call.\n\nThe Washington Post also reported last month that Morrison sought to host meetings in order to determine efforts to affect Ukraine policy that went outside the normal foreign diplomacy channels.\n\nMorrison has been asked to testify Friday, according to reports, along with Suriya Jayanti, a foreign service officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev.", "description": "House Democrats are set to depose a number of new witnesses this week as part of their impeachment inquiry examining President Trump\u2019s contacts with Ukraine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/impeachment_trumpdonald_101719getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
