That includes everything from fine artists like art nouveau painter Alphonse Mucha and Austrian symbolist Gustav Klimt, to modern video games and movies. Ward delights in juxtaposing these different styles. \"I love tension in art,\" he says. \"I like when you have a clash of style or form. I like how painters like Klimt, Francis Bacon, or contemporary artists will combine elements of realistic representation of people or places with purely abstract elements. I love the excitement that that can create.\"\n\nMore recently, Ward has started working on his first self-written ongoing series, where he\u2019ll contribute both the art and the words. It\u2019s something he\u2019s wanted to do for a long time \u2014 \"I've been writing stories for as long as I've been drawing,\" he says \u2014 but the plan was delayed as other projects popped up that he couldn\u2019t turn down.\n\n\"The only reason I've not written publicly sooner is that I've had opportunities to work with some of the best writers in comics,\" he says. \"I love the collaboration of creating something with someone. There's a real buzz as you bounce ideas backwards and forwards between you, and you can feel the idea becoming a real thing. ODY-C, for instance, was a very different beast than the one we thought we were going to create, and I love the surprise of that. As much as I love writing my own stories, there are so many fantastic writers out there who I would love to create something with.\"\n\nMoving forward, his goal is to continue writing his own stories through comics, though he admits that there are still some projects he definitely wouldn\u2019t say no to. \"I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a 14-year-old me that would love a crack at Batman.\"\n\nYou can see more of Ward's work on his site.", "description": "\"As soon as I could conceptualise being anything,\" Christian Ward says, \"I wanted to be a comic artist.
