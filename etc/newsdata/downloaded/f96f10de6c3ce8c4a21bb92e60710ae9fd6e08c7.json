Apps such as Facebook Messenger have expanded to allow users to communicate with businesses.\n\n\"CCMI will create the foundation for an innovative digital platform that not only connects consumers with friends and family, but also offers a seamless experience for consumers to connect with businesses in a compelling and trusted environment,\" said Ronan Dunne, CEO of Verizon Consumer Group, in a statement.\n\n6-year, 0% loan for a mattress?: Intense competition continues to grip mattress industry\n\nFree candy alert!: Snickers giving away free bags of candy.
