Tonight was one of those nights.\n\n\u201cWe have to accept we weren\u2019t good enough, move forward and congratulate the Czechs on their performance,\u201d he added.\n\nThe result puts the Czech Republic level on 12 points with Group A leaders England, albeit having played a game more.\n\nEngland\u2019s formation never looked right and they struggled with a lack of balance in midfield but Southgate said the problems were not just tactical.\n\n\u201cWhatever the balance, we didn\u2019t use the ball well enough. We have always maintained there is work to be done to be a really top team. Tonight was evidence of that. It\u2019s not a night for positives, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said.\n\nEngland face Bulgaria in Sofia on Monday and Southgate has plenty to work on with his squad, which will be without left back Danny Rose who is suspended after picking up a yellow card.\n\nRESPONSE NEEDED\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear we have to improve without the ball. It\u2019s something we have spoken about all week,\u201d said Southgate.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get the reaction we needed. It\u2019s going to be an interesting couple of days for us. We have to respond in the right way.\u201d\n\nThe performance was a throwback to the pre-Southgate era when England lacked fluency and it had little in common with some of their excellent attacking displays under him.\n\n\u201cI think we have had a lot of credit over the last couple of years and tonight we did not do enough. Our performance was not good enough, it\u2019s as simple as that. The goals we conceded were typical of the chances we gave away,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer England winger Chris Waddle, now a BBC pundit, was scathing in his assessment of the display from a team that had won all four of their Group A matches prior to Friday.\n\nSoccer Football - Euro 2020 Qualifier - Group A - Czech Republic v England - Sinobo Stadium, Prague, Czech Republic - October 11, 2019 England manager Gareth Southgate Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine\n\n\u201cIt was very, very, very poor. Not one player played to his ability,\u201d said the former Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur and Olympique de Marseille player.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been brilliant so far, and they have lost against a team who played well, ran their socks off and stuck to their game plan.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really see a positive tonight for England. Nobody has come off that pitch who you can say has had a good game tonight.\u201d", "description": "England manager Gareth Southgate said his team were simply not good enough after they slumped to a 2-1 Euro 2020 qualifying defeat away to the Czech Republic on Friday.", "authors": ["Michael Kahn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439861082&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A27M", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
