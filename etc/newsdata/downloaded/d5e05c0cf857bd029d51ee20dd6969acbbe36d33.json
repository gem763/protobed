This is not as easy to do as the candidates who back such plans believe it to be. For all the talk about how Medicare for All is a \u201cpie in the sky\u201d idea, what\u2019s left unsaid is that as soon as the wonk trigonometry that undergirds these plans makes contact with the mischiefs of ideology (and the depredations of industry lobbyists), these public option pastries are also launched into the cloud layer.\n\n\n\nCompared to Buttigieg or Biden\u2019s plans, which are (perhaps intentionally) lacking in detail, Medicare for America does the best job at contending with this challenge\u2014they really did their wonk-work on this one. As with premiums, out-of-pocket costs would be set on a sliding scale, from zero for people making less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level, up to $3,500 for an individual, or $5,000 for a family making 600 percent. It would supposedly automatically enroll the uninsured, but doesn\u2019t specify how; the bill simply calls for \u201ca process established by the Secretary for the automatic enrollment of eligible individuals who are not enrolled in other qualified health coverage.\u201d This is not a small question that they\u2019ve left in the hands of some future bureaucrat to puzzle out; it\u2019s the whole ballgame. If you can\u2019t ensure seamless coverage for everyone who doesn\u2019t have private insurance, you have not created a universal program.\n\n\n\nThese plans are all incredibly convoluted ways to avoid doing a very simple and much more morally correct thing: covering everybody.\n\nThese plans are all incredibly convoluted ways to avoid doing a very simple and much more morally correct thing: covering everybody. They make the fatal political miscalculation of taking something that is very hard to do and making it very complicated to do, as well. They recognize that everyone needs health care, which is why they subsidize care for less well-off people, but go to immense lengths to avoid paying for the care of people who are deemed to be able to afford it by the Wonk Formula.\n\n\n\nFor example, Medicare for America promises to automatically enroll the uninsured, but also expects everyone to pay income-based premiums. How sure can you be that these uninsured people will be able to afford their subsidized premium\u2014even if they have high student loan payments, or car payments, or are supporting a family member, or have credit card debt, or live in an expensive city? Are you positive that your Deserving Poor Matrix is generous enough to cover everyone, every eventuality, without anyone ever losing coverage because your math couldn\u2019t capture the vast range of human experience, misery, and misfortune in America? How confident are you in your wonk-work? Confident enough to say no to a system where no one is personally financially liable for ensuring their own care, or not?\n\n\n\nYou might say, well, nothing is perfect, and that\u2019s true. You might say, it\u2019s better than what we have now, this is certainly a fair assessment. You could say that Medicare for All promises a lot, too, and would raise taxes to boot. But promising the best of all worlds, where private insurance and public option seamlessly work together to provide insurance that never provides a cost barrier to anyone, is at best dangerous and at worst a recipe for another Affordable Care Act disaster. If we\u2019re going to go down the road of promising people that they can keep their plans once again, you better be absolutely sure that\u2019s true.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the next time the candidates appear on a debate stage, the same level of scrutiny and skepticism can be applied to the public option mavens and their plans, which are, if anything, woven from their own strands of gossamer. Medicare for All is a bunch of promises, and so are the public option plans. But the public option promises to be clever, where Medicare for All promises to be kind.
