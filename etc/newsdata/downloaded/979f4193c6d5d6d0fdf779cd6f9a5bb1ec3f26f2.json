The 24-year-old Indian content creator works hard while juggling her studies at a local university.\n\nAnd sometimes there just aren\u2019t enough hours in the day.\n\n\u201cI sometimes find the need to catch up with work on Sundays or on public holidays in order to make up for lost time,\u201d she says.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t feel too bad about doing so \u2013 it allows her to work more efficiently, she reckons, because she feels less pressure when she\u2019s not working in an office environment. \u201cMy results are vastly improved when I work on my downtime,\u201d Varma says.\n\nShe\u2019s not the only one. Nutrition and fitness expert Tom Jenane, who lives in Brighton in the UK, took his first holiday to catch up on work last year. He was juggling other duties alongside writing descriptions of the products sold at the company he works for, and found he just wasn\u2019t getting it all done during his working day.\n\n\u201cI took the day off to sit at home and write up the product descriptions,\u201d he says. \u201cI woke up naturally, made myself a coffee and set myself up on the sofa with the laptop, playing music in the background.\u201d\n\nAway from the distractions of a pinging inbox, watercooler chat with colleagues and the stresses of office life, the work Jenane, 31, had been struggling with for ages took him a day to complete.\n\nBut it required him to use up a precious day\u2019s annual leave.\n\nJenane and Varma exemplify leaveism - where employees feel compelled to take use their time off to catch up on their workload, free from the distractions of the office.", "description": "Leaveism is on the rise \u2013 but it\u2019s a sign something\u2019s broken.", "authors": ["Chris Stokel-Walker"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7m/0z/p07m0zrn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-30"}
