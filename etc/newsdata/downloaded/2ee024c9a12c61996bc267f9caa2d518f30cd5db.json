Photo: HBO\n\nSuccession fans have begged for a rap remix of the show\u2019s opening theme basically since it premiered last summer. Today, HBO announced an official remix by Pusha T and composer Nicholas Britell, to be released Friday ahead of the second season finale. Hallelujah!\n\nThe bombastic classical\u2013hip-hop hybrid gets a remix from a maestro: On \u201cPuppets (Succession Remix),\u201d Push raps about the demons chasing the blithely backbiting Roy family. The song has already been remixed by fans, memed, and even turned into a ringtone, but Britell knew exactly who he wanted to make the remix for the show itself: \u201cThere was only one person on the list of people to reach out to. Of course it had to be Pusha. There was no backup, there was no plan B,\u201d Britell says one morning in his Upper West Side studio, before pressing play on the remix and grinning. \u201cPusha\u2019s voice is like a missile!\u201d\n\nPusha T first heard about Succession from his manager, who said the rapper reminded him of Logan Roy. (When I ask him about this comparison, he demurs: \u201cI mean, I\u2019m a little bit [like him].\u201d) He happened to meet Britell in Los Angeles, at a Pharrell recording session. Pusha says he caught up on Succession\u2019s first season and then Britell pitched him the remix. \u201cWe talked about the connection to power and its dynamic, issues writ large: struggle, pain, all of the things we could deal with,\u201d Britell says. Then Pusha went into the studio: \u201c[Nick] gave me this track, and I said all right. I said, \u2018So I\u2019mma go back, and I\u2019m gonna listen to it, and I\u2019mma just come up with some things.\u2019\u201d\n\nBritell was happy with his first pass, Pusha says, but someone else at HBO felt the lyrics gave away too many plot details from season two, which hadn\u2019t aired yet. \u201cI was like, \u2018How, I didn\u2019t even see it?!\u2019\u201d he laughs. \u201cSo I tweaked some things because the lines were a bit too detailed. I think [Nick] didn\u2019t want to ask me to redo anything. Ordinarily, I probably wouldn\u2019t have. But, I mean, the show is dope.\u201d\n\nThe result is exactly what you\u2019d want from Pusha T rapping over a track as good as the Succession theme. For the remix, Britell made the sound bigger and bolder with more bass and hi-hat \u2014 \u201cThe bass probably shouldn\u2019t be that big, it\u2019s too big for itself,\u201d Britell says \u2014 and adding a choral arrangement and a drop divine enough to bring a tear to mine eye. Pusha doesn\u2019t rap about the Roy family specifically, but about the show\u2019s themes: family and money, but also avarice, betrayal, and loving someone as you\u2019re sabotaging them. The title is \u201cPuppets,\u201d but it\u2019s as much about the person pulling the strings. \u201cIt\u2019s a free fall when I leave y\u2019all,\u201d Pusha snaps on the remix, perhaps showing his affinity for Logan. (For the record, Push says he thinks Roman is the one to take over the company.)\n\n\u201cThe greed, the resentment, the idea anybody is basically disposable \u2014 that\u2019s a gangsta movie type of quality. On Succession, it\u2019s involving family, it\u2019s like, Whoa! It\u2019s a bit more shocking,\u201d Pusha says. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s what made the writing process fun, because I could use all of the street, gangster rap nuances and qualities and energy and incorporate it into the theme of the music. It was really just a dope exercise, honestly.\u201d\n\nIt also helped that Britell, who previously composed Moonlight\u2019s chopped and screwed score, is a big hip-hop head. For Kendall\u2019s \u201cL to the O G\u201d rap at Logan\u2019s plaque dedication in \u201cDundee,\u201d the show used a beat Britell produced years ago, with a melodic motif that itself is a variation on a Bach C-minor prelude. \u201cMy love of hip-hop, that\u2019s woven into the whole show. To be more overt with it is great. The fun of hip-hop is breaking shit apart and seeing what you can do with it. The remix felt like an opportunity to do that, especially for fans of the show who\u2019ve been wanting \u2014 and even making \u2014 this.\u201d", "description": "Succession fans have begged for a rap remix of the show\u2019s opening theme basically since it premiered last summer.
