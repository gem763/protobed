That\u2019s why several veteran leaders stood up in front of their teammates and implored them to stick together.\n\n\u201cThey said they\u2019ve been on teams that were definitely a lot worse than this,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe have a lot of talent. We\u2019re 0-4 right now, but the season isn\u2019t over and we still have a lot to fight for.\u201d\n\nCenter Ryan Kalil, who came out of retirement in August to join the Jets, was one of those who spoke up. Williams said his words, in particular, stuck with him.\n\n\u201cWe just have to stay levelheaded,\u201d Williams said of Kalil\u2019s message. \u201cNot get too high when we win and not get too down when we lose and not be on a roller-coaster or anything like that. He\u2019s been in this league a long time, so hearing it from a guy like that meant a lot.\u201d\n\nWilliams wouldn\u2019t go into detail as to whether it was a players-only meeting or who else spoke, but it\u2019s clear the Jets are concerned about how things are going.\n\nNew York is off to its worst start in 16 years - matching the 2003 team under Herman Edwards that also opened 0-4 and came in between playoff seasons for the team. The Jets take on Dallas at home on Sunday and are staring at their first 0-5 start since 1996.\n\nYep, the 1-15 season under Rich Kotite.\n\nThe return of Sam Darnold from his bout with mononucleosis remains on hold, with the quarterback scheduled to have tests Tuesday to determine if he\u2019ll be medically cleared to play.\n\nIf so, coach Adam Gase said Darnold will start. If not, it will be Luke Falk under center again.\n\nThe Jets were optimistic last week that Darnold would get the OK and gave him all the starting snaps in practice Wednesday and Thursday. But test results last Thursday night showed the swelling of his spleen had not yet dissipated enough, so Falk took the snaps with the starters Friday ahead of his second straight start.\n\nFalk struggled along with the rest of the offense in the 31-6 loss to Philadelphia. He went 15 of 26 for 120 yards with two interceptions, and was sacked nine times.\n\n\u201cWe took our turns, whether it was the quarterback not getting the ball out on time, we busted a route, the O-line not using protection the right way,\u201d Gase said. \u201cThere were a couple calls where no one was open. When I say that, it\u2019s what they ran on defense wasn\u2019t ideal for what they called. It wasn\u2019t pretty. It was a bad performance on the offensive side.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe defense. Gregg Williams\u2019 group has been a bit overshadowed by the ineptitude of the offense, but the Jets have been respectable - especially considering how little help the defense has gotten from the other side of the ball.\n\nNew York ranks 13th in overall defense and seventh against the run. That comes after mostly solid performances against Tom Brady and the Patriots two weeks ago and Carson Wentz and the Eagles on Sunday.\n\nThat\u2019s also despite not having inside linebacker C.J. Mosley since he injured his groin in the third quarter of the opener. The pass rush needs help, though, with only six sacks through four games. The return of outside linebacker Brandon Copeland from a four-game suspension could be a boost.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nWell, this could be a mighty lengthy list.\n\nBut ask anyone around the Jets what needs to get better - and fast - and the overwhelming answer is an easy one:\n\nDarnold\u2019s spleen.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nDemaryius Thomas. It wasn\u2019t an eye-popping performance, by any means, and the veteran wide receiver had an embarrassing whiff on a would-be long reception. But, Thomas made it back to the field after missing most of the last two games after injuring his hamstring early in Week 2 against Cleveland. He finished with four catches for a team-leading 47 yards, a sign the 31-year-old Thomas might be able to make an impact.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nTy Montgomery. The running back/wide receiver was expected to be a versatile complement to Le\u2019Veon Bell in Gase\u2019s offense, but he has been barely used. Montgomery has only nine carries for 31 yards and three catches for 15 yards in an offense that desperately needs help. It has been a puzzling start for Montgomery, who was signed to a one-year deal in March.\n\nINJURED\n\nDefensive end Henry Anderson has a shoulder injury that Gase said could be \u201cweek to week\u201d and will depend a lot upon whether Anderson can play through the pain and discomfort.\n\nGase was uncertain whether Mosley would return to practice Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re just not sure how close we are,\u201d Gase said.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n233 - That\u2019s how many yards of total offense the Jets have in their last two games - combined. With Falk starting, they had 105 against New England two weeks ago and 128 at Philadelphia.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nTuesday will be important for the Jets, with the latest round of tests helping determine Darnold\u2019s availability for the game against Dallas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably more than just Sam getting out there,\u201d Gase said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of other things to clean up. Sam\u2019s able to hide things sometimes for us, where if we make a mistake, he covers it up.\n\n\u201cI think we just need to do a better job as a group making sure we\u2019re all 11 on the same page.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The struggling and short-handed Jets returned to work Monday, still without a win but with their locker room remaining united.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/jets_eagles_football_86594_c0-159-3788-2367_s1770x1032.jpg?724ac050f1e92cbd800c2779bd9f400f3a786f25", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
