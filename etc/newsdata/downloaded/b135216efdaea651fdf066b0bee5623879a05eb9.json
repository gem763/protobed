It turned up in a running back almost in tears as he made a clinching 88-yard run while most of the 90,584 in attendance boomed. It turned up in the swell of noise greeting a respectable quarterback when he reemerged from the tunnel after a second-quarter pop in the knee turned out to be a merciful sprain. It turned up in stirring rendition of Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down,\u201d blaring through \u00adPetty\u2019s hometown between the third and fourth quarters.\n\nAnd it turned up when second-year coach Dan Mullen made his way to a postgame microphone and said a word generally spelled \u201cwhew\u201d but that sounded like \u201cHooooo!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCollege football winners and losers for Week 6\n\n\u201cJust want to let everybody know that we\u2019re here,\u201d said running back Lamical Perine, his 88-yard run the longest for Florida since a certain Emmitt Smith went for 96 in 1988 against \u00adMississippi State.\n\n\u201cI think this one\u2019ll definitely wake everybody up\u201d around the country, said Kyle Trask, the redshirt junior quarterback freshly famed for never having started from ninth grade until this past Sept. 14, who departed to respectful applause with 10:18 left in the second quarter, then returned to a swell of cheers nine game minutes later.\n\n\u201cI just feel like we\u2019ve been working so hard that we\u2019re earning our respect,\u201d said safety Shawn Davis, part of a defense that didn\u2019t let Auburn peep past the 100-yard mark in total offense until early in the third quarter.\n\nAD\n\nAnd then, \u201c \u2018The Swamp,\u2019 what it used to be,\u201d Mullen said, echoing a common quotation. \u201cThis is what \u2018The Swamp\u2019 is, and I think that\u2019s what we expect it to be.\u201d He soon added, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for any team to come in here . . . if that\u2019s how the crowd\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhile \u201cThe Swamp\u201d behaved thusly, Florida (6-0, 3-0 SEC) provided it just enough plays to make it thunder. Two in particular shone \u2014 a 64-yard pass touchdown from Trask to Freddie Swain on Florida\u2019s second play from scrimmage near the outset \u2014 \u201ca confidence booster,\u201d as Swain put it \u2014 and Perine\u2019s 88-yard stomp up the right sideline and beyond the final guy lunging at him with 9:04 left. That boomer loosened a weirdly tight game from 17-13 to its closing 24-13.\n\nThe Kyle Trask Story: Six years as a backup QB, then a Hollywood debut for Florida\n\nFrom the get-go in the giant commotion, when Auburn freshman quarterback Bo Nix made a little tour of his offensive linemen to bark a play call into their earholes, \u201cThe Swamp\u201d conspired with the Florida defense to provide a reminder about Nix:\n\nAD\n\nThis was his sixth college game.\n\nAs this became a game Auburn fans hope he\u2019ll recollect as an important thud along the path to chronic highlights, the son of an Auburn quarterback often looked like somebody who was born in February 2000. (He was.) His passing could not free Auburn\u2019s vaunted rushing very many times in the game, and he wound up on 11 completions in 27 attempts for 145 yards.\n\nAD\n\nNix threw slightly too far toward Seth Williams on an electrifying 46-yard play in the third quarter with the score still 17-13, and Williams had to lunge and fall to get it 13 yards from the end zone, rather than catching it in stride and scoring easily. Nix threw to the ground before Williams on a hopeful slant two plays later. Nix threw an interception to Donovan Stiner in an end zone too crowded for such a try. And in a symbolic play, Nix ran backward, veering here and veering there into a 22-yard sack that preceded Perine\u2019s smash run.\n\nAD\n\nFlorida\u2019s defense proved so bothersome that even Auburn\u2019s touchdown had a wince to it. It came just after Mullen called for a fake punt that failed through more of Auburn\u2019s excellent tackling.\n\n\u201cThey gave up one score, and that was on me,\u201d said Mullen, an offensive coordinator here late last decade during the Urban Meyer glory days, then a head coach for nine seasons at Mississippi State. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t fake the punt, they probably don\u2019t get the touchdown. I ended up causing their only touchdown.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat mattered more than it might have because Auburn\u2019s defensive line, among the country\u2019s best units of any kind, kept causing turnovers. Three of Florida\u2019s four lost fumbles came via sacks by the Auburn line. The 318-pound defensive tackle Derrick Brown took off twice with the ball, once rumbling 41 yards downfield until he seemed to simply fall.\n\nAD\n\nYet Auburn (5-1, 2-1) wrung just six points from those four turnovers, as the defense and \u201cThe Swamp\u201d kept thickening.\n\nWithin the drama played two individual dramas, involving Perine and Trask.\n\nThe former had gotten to a meeting last Monday at 8 a.m. with, he said, \u201ca mind-set totally different.\u201d He\u2019s an Alabamian whom Auburn hadn\u2019t recruited, so he said Saturday: \u201cI just felt like they weren\u2019t very interested in me at the time. They probably thought I was a little too slow, as everybody knows.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEverybody laughed then, and he said, 130 rushing yards in fresh memory, \u201cI wanted them to understand that it meant a lot to me to get out there.\u201d He said, \u201cI know I\u2019m a big-time player, and a lot of people, they doubt me sometimes. . . . It was just an honor, man, to be able to make a big play for this team.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThen even \u201cThe Swamp\u201d went quiet when Trask, the marvel of patience and toil who played backup quarterback at Manvel High in Texas and backup for three years at Florida before starting these last three games, went down in the second quarter with a knee injury too gruesome to study.\n\nAfter Auburn\u2019s Marlon Anderson got blocked and held to a position low enough that he rammed into Trask\u2019s knee, the 6-foot-5 quarterback felt \u201ca lot of pain\u201d and \u201cfelt a little pop.\u201d He said, \u201cIt was just a really scary moment for me because I know knees are nothing to play around with.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe got up and retreated through the tunnel to applause. While the trainers studied him, he asked how quarterback Emory Jones was doing and felt stoked Jones had gotten Florida to a field goal. When they came back to him with the results, he said: \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t know what I was about to hear. I was probably ready to hear the [bad news], I guess.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNews of a sprain lifted him, then the crowd lifted him more. \u201cNothing was given to us in this game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was all earned.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re building. I know what the Gator standard is, and I know what the expectations are, and trust me, my expectations are even higher.\u201d\n\nHe said that soon after saying, \u201cJust a regular day in \u2018The Swamp,\u2019 huh?\u201d\n\nThey do hope it will become so.\n\nRead more:\n\nJohn Feinstein: Why is service academy football so special?
