[BYUN SUN-GOO]\n\nLeaders of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party express opposition at the National Assembly on Tuesday after President Moon Jae-in mentions the creation of a new investigative body to probe high-ranking officials. [BYUN SUN-GOO]\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in on Tuesday vowed to complete his reform of the criminal justice system, blaming the prosecution\u2019s lack of integrity for his predecessor\u2019s abuse of power.At the National Assembly, Moon also explained the need for the country\u2019s largest-ever budget next year and his vision for the remaining 31 months of his term.Moon addressed lawmakers in the morning to explain the government\u2019s plan for next year\u2019s budget and agenda. It was his fourth budget speech at the National Assembly and the first visit to the legislature since the political turmoil surrounding key ally Cho Kuk, who lasted as justice minister for 35 days.\u201cThe time has come for our administration to prepare for the final two years and a half,\u201d Moon said in the speech.\u201cI have once again felt the people\u2019s desires for fairness and reform,\u201d Moon said, referring to the scandal surrounding former Justice Minister Cho. A self-professed champion of prosecutorial reform, Cho was forced to relinquish his post in the cabinet over investigations into his children\u2019s academic careers and suspicious family wealth dealings.\u201cThe government has put efforts to remove privileges, foul play and unfairness rampant in our society, but the people\u2019s demand was much stronger,\u201d Moon said. \u201cIt was the people\u2019s demand that even the legitimate inequities and privileges within the system must be fundamentally changed.\u201cThe people demand that the leaders of our society demonstrate a higher sense of fairness,\u201d Moon said, without directly discussing the scandals surrounding Cho. \u201cAs the president, I feel heavily responsible.\u201dMoon promised an overhaul of the college admissions system, noting that \u201cthe public was most hurt by inequality in education.\u201dThe president also vowed to continue his campaign to reform the prosecution. He urged the National Assembly to quickly approve pending bills, particularly a plan to create a new investigation agency to probe crimes committed by high-ranking officials.\u201cThere is opposition to the need for the new agency,\u201d Moon said, \u201cbut I want to ask what other alternative we have, if the prosecution fails to hold itself accountable for wrongdoings committed by its own members.\u201cThe new investigation agency is also extremely meaningful as an organ to probe corruption committed by presidential relatives and associates,\u201d Moon said. \u201cIf the law enforcement bodies functioned properly to investigate any abuse of power and hold those responsible accountable, we would have not experienced the presidential scandal [of Park Geun-hye].\u201dMoon said the new investigation agency will improve transparency among senior public servants, starting with the ones serving in his administration.In the speech, Moon also promised to listen to people with different opinions and reflect on himself. For the sake of national unity, Moon vowed to meet more frequently with leaders of all political parties.In the first part of his address, Moon explained the need for a \u201cbold\u201d expansionary economic policy. \u201cUnless we counter the situation properly now, we will end up paying a far higher cost in the near future,\u201d Moon said.According to Moon, the government wants to implement a budget of 513.5 trillion won ($438.7 billion) next year. That largest-ever amount is 9.3 percent higher that this year\u2019s 469.6 billion won budget. The budget proposal was submitted to the National Assembly on Sept. 3.Moon explained the need to spend so much next year. \u201cThe state budget must play an active role as a breakwater to stop the waves from outside,\u201d Moon said. \u201cThe expansionary policy for next year is a must, not an option.\u201d\u201cOver the past two years, I was able to lay the foundation to create a country in which all people prosper based on the pillars of innovation and inclusiveness, thanks to the role of fiscal policies,\u201d Moon said. \u201cThe outcomes are just about to be produced. In order for our economy to overcome outside tensions and regain vitality, the state budget must continue playing a key role.\u201cSome worry about fiscal soundness,\u201d Moon said. \u201cBut Korea\u2019s fiscal soundness and economic power have grown enough to allow more people to enjoy better quality lives. The country\u2019s fiscal soundness is very healthy.\u201dKorea\u2019s national debt-to-GDP ratio will not exceed 40 percent even after the 2020 budget plan is implemented, Moon said. \u201cThat is much lower than the average 110 percent for the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,\u201d Moon said. \u201cOur fiscal soundness is ranked at the top.\u201dAs Moon entered the National Assembly, lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Party (DP) gave him a rousing welcome. Opposition lawmakers, including those from the Liberty Korea Party (LKP), stood up to greet him but gave no applause.DP lawmakers applauded loudly when Moon discussed the need to reform the prosecution. Opposition lawmakers, however, made \u201cX\u201d signs by crossing their hands in protest. Moon\u2019s eyes were locked on the LKP lawmakers as he discussed the need to reform the prosecution.Immediately after Moon ended his speech, LKP lawmakers stood up and left the room. Moon shook hands with some LKP lawmakers who remained and followed the rest to the door. Only then did the LKP lawmakers stop and shake hands with the president.Moon received 28 rounds of applause during his speech all from the DP lawmakers.He gave his first budget speech to the National Assembly in June 2017, immediately after his inauguration the previous month, and presented a supplementary budget proposal. He gave another in November 2017 and last year.The ruling and opposition parties were split over Moon\u2019s speech, particularly over the largest-ever budget proposal and prosecutorial reform.While the DP and the government said expansionary spending was crucial to reduce economic uncertainties caused by U.S.-China trade frictions and Japan\u2019s export restrictions, the LKP and Bareunmirae Party said the plan will increase government debt.The LKP was particularly sensitive about the political timing. LKP Chairman Hwang Kyo-ahn said Monday that the largest-ever budget is for pork-barreling policies to \u201cbuy votes with cash\u201d ahead of an April general election.The DP and the LKP were also split about Moon\u2019s campaign to weaken the prosecution\u2019s powers by establishing the new investigation agency.\u201cWhen I heard Moon saying \u2018legitimate inequities and privileges,\u2019 I almost choked,\u201d Hwang said. \u201cHe was giving guidelines about various illegalities committed by the Cho family.\u201dRep. Na Kyung-won, floor leader of the LKP, said Moon\u2019s speech failed to persuade the public. \u201cThe highlight was Moon\u2019s rush to justify the new investigation agency,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants to turn around the situation with that initiative, but his impatience may spoil the matter.\u201dBY SER MYO-JA [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/22195342.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
