Now the Marine Stewardship Council has decided to remove its \u2018blue tick\u2019 sustainability label from supermarket and restaurant cod fished off the coast of Britain.\n\nCod stocks peaked at 270,000 tons in the 1970s, but they are predicted to hit only 81,755 tons next year\n\nIt marks a major turnaround because two years ago the MSC announced North Sea cod could be eaten with a \u2018clear conscience\u2019 as fish numbers were healthy at 152,207 tons \u2013 the highest since 1982.\n\nThe MSC is an independent non-profit organisation which sets the standard for sustainable fishing. It is relied upon by many big retailers and families to know if the fish they sell or eat is from stocks whose levels are big enough to carry on in the future.\n\nThe North Sea cod decision \u2013 based on scientific advice \u2013 is a blow to the fishing industry, which has been trying to avoid catching young cod and stay out of spawning areas.\n\nHowever, the North Sea fish make up only a small proportion of the cod eaten in British homes with 94 per cent imported from countries such as Iceland, Norway and Russia. Warmer waters in the North Sea caused by climate change are thought to be cutting numbers, with fewer young cod surviving into adulthood.\n\nScientists say anything under 107,000 tons of cod increases the possibility of fisheries collapsing\n\nThe MSC will remove its blue label \u2013 which is made up of a tick and a fish symbol \u2013 from restaurant menus and supermarket packaging for cod caught after October 24.\n\nErin Priddle, of the MSC, said: \u2018While this news is devastating for industry, it is a testament to the MSC standard working as it should \u2013 to pick up on threats to stock sustainability.\u2019\n\nStocks had been forecast to hit 180,990 tons in 2018, but scientists now say they were much smaller.\n\nThe Scottish Fisheries Sustainable Accreditation Group said: \u2018The industry are concerned that, notwithstanding their best efforts to continue to rebuild North Sea cod, some developments are taking place that seem beyond their control. They are committed to introducing balanced and proportionate measures in an attempt to reverse the decline.\u2019\n\nThe MSC change in labelling is not expected to see prices going up. Consumers wanting to eat sustainably are predicted to switch to imported cod instead. It is also not thought supplies will be affected as these are governed by quotas.\n\nA total of 29 UK fisheries are in the MSC programme, representing 54 per cent of the British catch.\n\nJust six months ago the MSC removed its \u2018blue tick\u2019 sustainability certificate for mackerel.", "description": "North Sea stocks peaked at 270,000 tons in the 1970s\u00a0but are predicted to hit only 81,755 tons next year.
