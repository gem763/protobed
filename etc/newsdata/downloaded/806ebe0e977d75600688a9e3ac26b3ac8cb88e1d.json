REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson\n\nThe U.S. air accident investigator unveiled on Thursday several recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) following the fatal crashes of a Lion Air 737 MAX in Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX five months apart that killed a total of 346 people. The crashes led to the plane\u2019s grounding and raised questions about the FAA\u2019s certification of the new aircraft.\n\nThe crews in those crashes \u201cdid not react in the ways Boeing and the FAA assumed they would,\u201d said NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt, adding there was a \u201cgap between the assumptions used to certify the MAX and the real-world experiences of these crews, where pilots were faced with multiple alarms and alerts at the same time.\u201d\n\nBoeing has said the feeding of erroneous Angle of Attack (AOA) data to a system called MCAS that pushed the planes lower was a common link in two wider chains of events leading to the crashes. MCAS stands for Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System.\n\n\u201cWe want FAA to ensure that Boeing takes a close look at all these different failure conditions that can activate MCAS and ensure that they have evaluated the pilots\u2019 response to that,\u201d Dana Schulze, director of the NTSB Office of Aviation Safety, told reporters. NTSB wants that assessment completed before the plane\u2019s grounding is lifted.\n\nBoeing\u2019s 737 MAX simulator tests with test pilots \u201cdid not look at all potential flight deck alerts and indications that pilots might face when this specific failure condition occurred in Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines,\u201d Schulze said, adding that Boeing did not evaluate the \u201cactual scenario\u201d of the two fatal crashes in the simulator.\n\nBoeing should \u201cmore clearly and concisely inform pilots of the highest priority actions when multiple flight deck alerts and indications are present,\u201d the NTSB said.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives Transportation Committee chairman Peter DeFazio said on Thursday that the NTSB report suggests Boeing \u201cmay not have made realistic assumptions about how pilots respond to multiple simultaneous and potentially confusing warnings in emergency situations.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommercial airplanes should be able to be safely flown by an appropriately-trained pilot on his or her worst day,\u201d DeFazio added.\n\nThe FAA said in a statement it \u201cwill carefully review these and all other recommendations as we continue our review of the proposed changes to the Boeing 737 MAX.\u201d\n\nBoeing, in a statement, said it is \u201ccommitted to working with the FAA in reviewing the NTSB recommendations.\u201d\n\n\u2018WAKE-UP CALL\u2019\n\nRobert Clifford, the lead lawyer for families of victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash who are suing Boeing, said the recommendations should be \u201ca wake-up call\u201d for the FAA \u201cto put these measures into effect as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe NTSB said the FAA should address assumptions Boeing and other manufacturers make in designing software systems to react to emergencies, and whether the systems should be revised to account for varying pilot reactions to cockpit alarms and alerts.\n\nThe safety board also said the FAA should develop \u201crobust tools and methods\u201d to validate assumptions about pilot response.\n\nBoeing is revising the 737 MAX software to require the MCAS system to receive input from both AOA sensors, and has added additional safeguards.\n\nThe report came a day after Boeing\u2019s board said it had created a new permanent safety committee to oversee development, manufacturing and operation of its aircraft and services.\n\nThe NTSB said it was not analysing pilot actions in the two fatal crashes and that the recommendations were not a reflection on the pilots in those crashes.\n\nBoeing\u2019s 737 MAX safety system assessments assumed \u201cimmediate and appropriate pilot corrective actions in response to uncommanded flight control inputs, from systems such as MCAS,\u201d the NTSB said. It should take into account how other possible flight deck alerts and other factors could impact pilots\u2019 decision making and makes changes as warranted, the agency added.\n\nThe NTSB said it wants the FAA to require the same assessment for all other airplane manufacturers and believes other international regulators that certify airplanes should consider making the same changes.\n\nIt is not clear when Boeing will conduct a key certification test flight, a step needed before the FAA can return the plane to service. The company has said it hopes to resume flights early in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe FAA said last week it will need a month after the test flight is completed before it could allow flights to resume.", "description": "Boeing Co failed to adequately consider how pilots respond to cockpit emergencies in its 737 MAX safety assessment and may need to make changes to flight deck alerts, pilot procedures and training, the National Transportation Safety Board said.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434261162&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1SZ", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
