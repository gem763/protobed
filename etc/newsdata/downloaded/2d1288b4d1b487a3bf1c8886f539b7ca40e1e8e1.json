When we were told Anne Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity it was a punch in the face.\u2019\n\nHe added that he felt as though his family had been repeatedly told: \u2018Tough, she\u2019s not coming back, end of story. Go away and cry at home.\u2019\n\nHe described hearing about Anne Sacoolas\u2019 diplomatic immunity as a \u2018punch in the face\u2019 (Picture: Ian McILGORM 2019)\n\nHarry Dunn was killed in a road collision (Picture: Justice 4 Harry)\n\nNiall had been housebound with grief since his brother\u2019s death, but decided to speak out after witnessing his parents their worldwide campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continued: \u2018It was really difficult hearing [that Mrs Sacoolas had immunity] and knowing we had nowhere left to go, nothing left to do.\n\n\u2018It was swept under the carpet and that\u2019s what really got to me. It made me angry.\n\n\u2018Harry lost his life. We\u2019ve lost everything. I want to know who decided this was OK to do this to us.\u2019\n\nAppealing directly to Mrs Sacoolas, who is married to alleged US spy Jonathan Sacoolas, he urged her to do the \u2018right thing\u2019.\n\nNiall has decided to speak out after seeing his parents campaigning (Picture: Ian McILGORM 2019)\n\nHe said: \u2018Although that time\u2019s passed you can still put an end to all of this.\u2019\n\nMrs Sacoolas is believed to have been driving on the wrong side of the road when she hit Harry\u2019s motorbike outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on August 27.\n\nFamily of 'Essex lorry victim' say they 'begged her not to go'\n\nHarry\u2019s parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, have since met with US President Donald Trump in Washington to discuss the matter, but their quest for justice is no further forward.\n\nEarlier this week it was confirmed that Northamptonshire Police are sending officers to the US to talk to Mrs Sacoolas.\n\nFamily spokesman Radd Seiger said: \u2018The family were told the police had passed their file to the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) yet tonight were informed that the police were travelling to the US to interview Mrs Sacoolas.\n\nMrs Sacoolas left the UK days after the crash (Picture: Facebook)\n\n\u2018Those two statements appear to be contradictory on the face of it, further compounding the family\u2019s misery.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the Commons he had commissioned a review into immunity arrangements for US personnel and their families at the RAF Croughton annex.\n\nMr Raab said there are \u2018no barriers to justice being done\u2019 for Harry, adding that the government believes diplomatic immunity \u2018clearly ended\u2019 for Mrs Sacoolas when she left Britain.\n\nHe added it would be for the CPS and police to decide what steps to take, telling MPs he is \u2018not aware of any obstacle\u2019 under the UK/US Extradition Treaty.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
