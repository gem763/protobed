Some say the project's construction has become more about sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski and his family, who have devoted their lives to the sculpture, rather than focusing on the Native Americans it's meant to honor.\n\nZiolkowski spent his life working on the granite, but he did not live to even see the finished face. \"Go slowly, so you do it right,\" he told his second wife. He thought it would take 30 years. It's now been 71 years, and it's far from finished.\n\nHere's what the sculpture is like so far, and why finishing it is taking so long.", "description": "In 1948 work began on Crazy Horse, a Native American monument in South Dakota.
