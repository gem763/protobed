They also accuse police of brutality.\n\nWong, 22, said there is \"new bipartisan consensus\" in Congress towards China and Hong Kong. More than 50 US lawmakers are co-sponsors of the bill, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, he said.\n\n\"Hopefully this bill will get passed very soon within these one or two months,\" Hong Kong pop star and activist Denise Ho, 42, who testified alongside Wong in Congress, told AFP in the interview.\n\n\"I hope that other governments would follow.\"\n\nA related piece of legislation under consideration would ban the sale of tear gas, rubber bullets and other crowd control equipment to the Hong Kong police which Ho described as \"out of control\" in their response towards demonstrators.\n\n\"This trip in DC was very fruitful. We have seen a lot of support from the Congress,\" said Ho, whose music has been banned in mainland China for her activism.\n\n\"So I do feel that is a very powerful encouragement to the Hong Kong people.\"\n\nThe activists later unfurled a banner outside the US Capitol bearing more than 2,000 signatures in support of the bill.\n\nHo, Wong and other activists have also visited Germany, Taiwan and Australia to raise awareness.\n\nTheir US visit added to Beijing's accusations that \"external forces\" are behind the unrest.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday that the US should \"stop supporting violent radical forces and Hong Kong independence separatists, and stop adding fuel to the fire.\"\n\nBeijing summoned Germany's ambassador after Wong visited Berlin and met Foreign Minister Heiko Maas earlier this month.\n\nWong said that in Washington the activists met an assistant secretary of state to whom they emphasized the importance of the legislation.", "description": "Prominent Hong Kong protesters expressed optimism Saturday that US legislators will pass by year's end a bill aimed at defending civil rights in the global financial hub roiled by pro-democracy demonstrations and accusations of police abuse.
