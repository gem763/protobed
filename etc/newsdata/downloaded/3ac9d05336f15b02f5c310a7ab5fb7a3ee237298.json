(Missouri Department of Corrections via AP File)\n\nBONNE TERRE, Mo. (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the execution of Russell Bucklew in Missouri (all times local):\n\n6:48 p.m.\n\nA Missouri man has been executed for killing a man during a violent 1996 crime spree, despite concerns that the inmate's rare medical condition would cause a gruesome lethal injection.\n\nRussell Bucklew was executed Tuesday evening at the state prison in Bonne Terre. It was Missouri's first execution since January 2017.\n\nBucklew looked around and twitched his feet beneath the sheet as he lay on the gurney just before the lethal injection. He suddenly took a deep breath and all movement stopped.\n\nThere were no outward signs of distress.\n\nBucklew had twice previously been within hours of execution, only to have the U.S. Supreme Court grant last-minute reprieves over concerns that Bucklew might suffer during the execution process. He had a condition called cavernous hemangioma and had blood-filled tumors in his head, neck and throat.\n\nBucklew's attorneys said in a clemency request to Gov. Mike Parson that a throat tumor could burst, causing Bucklew to choke to death. Parson denied clemency earlier Tuesday.\n\nBucklew killed Michael Sanders in March 1996, raped his former girlfriend, shot a state trooper and, after escaping from jail, attacked his ex-girlfriend's mother and her boyfriend with a hammer.\n\n___\n\n10:30 a.m.\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson has denied clemency for a convicted killer hours before the man is scheduled to be put to death.\n\nRussell Bucklew has a rare medical condition that his attorneys say could result in a gruesome execution, which is scheduled for 6 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nDefense attorney Cheryl Pilate confirmed Parson denied clemency.\n\nBucklew was convicted of killing Michael Sanders in 1996.\n\nHe suffers from cavernous hemangioma. He has blood-filled tumors in his head, neck and throat. A permanent tracheostomy in his throat helps him breathe. His attorneys said in the clemency request that if one of the throat tumors bursts, Bucklew could choke to death.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court gave the go-ahead for the execution in April; Pilate didn't say if any last-minute court appeals are planned.\n\n___\n\n11 p.m.\n\nThe fate of a condemned Missouri inmate rests with Gov. Mike Parson, who must decide if the risk posed by Russell Bucklew's unusual medical condition is grave enough to halt his execution.\n\nBucklew is scheduled to be put to death Tuesday evening for killing a man during a violent 1996 crime spree. The U.S. Supreme Court in April gave the go-ahead for Bucklew to be executed, so court appeals appear to be exhausted.\n\nParson, a Republican supporter of the death penalty, is weighing a clemency request.\n\nBucklew suffers from cavernous hemangioma. He has blood-filled tumors in his head, neck and throat. A permanent tracheostomy in his throat helps him breathe. His attorneys say in the clemency request that if one of the throat tumors bursts, Bucklew could choke to death.", "description": "A Missouri man has been executed for killing a man during a violent 1996 crime spree, despite concerns that the inmate's rare medical condition would cause a gruesome lethal injection.
