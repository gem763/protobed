Let\u2019s not mince words: that\u2019s rape. More than 3 million American women, this suggests, lost their virginity because they were raped.\n\nWhere do these numbers come from? Well, the study analysed responses from over 13,000 women aged between 18 and 44 who participated in the 2011-2017 National Survey of Family Growth, a nationally representative US government health survey. The survey asked: \u201cWould you say that this first vaginal intercourse [with a male] was voluntary or not voluntary, that is, did you choose to have sex of your own free will or not?\u201d If women responded \u201cnot voluntary\u201d, the researchers categorized them as having experienced \u201cforced sexual initiation\u201d.\n\nPut it away: Texas passes law against dick pics | Arwa Mahdawi Read more\n\nNearly three-quarters of women who experienced forced sexual initiation were under 18 at the time, according to the research. Women whose first experience of sex was rape were also less likely to be white and more likely to have income below the poverty level. Unsurprisingly, researchers also found that forced sexual initiation appears to be associated with physical and mental health problems later in life.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of handwringing lately over whether #MeToo has gone too far. This study should be a visceral reminder that #MeToo hasn\u2019t gone nearly far enough. Rape culture is endemic in America; as one sex education specialist told the Associated Press in reference to the report, \u201cOur culture teaches people not to be raped instead of teaching people not to rape.\u201d\n\nIf you want to see how deeply rooted rape culture is just take a look at who is running the country and shaping the law. A third of the six male justices on America\u2019s supreme court have been accused of sexual misconduct. Meanwhile Attorney General William Barr endorsed a 2017 book called Campus Rape Frenzy, which essentially argues men are the real victims of sexual assault in universities. \u201c[T]he false narrative of a \u2018rape culture\u2019 on college campuses \u2013 has created a regime of kangaroo justice,\u201d Barr wrote in a blurb for the book. \u201cYour blood will boil as the authors meticulously examine scores of cases where, in the name of political correctness, male students are sacrificed to the mob.\u201d\n\nAnd, of course, there\u2019s the proud pussy-grabber who is currently president of the United States. Donald Trump, let\u2019s just take a moment to remember, was credibly accused of rape just a few months ago. The accusations made headlines for a few days and then we all stopped talking about it. Apparently, that\u2019s how numb we have become to the fact that a sexual predator is the most powerful man in the world. That\u2019s how numb we\u2019ve become to a society in which sexual violence is so normalized that one in 16 women lost their virginity through rape.\n\nWomen are getting surgery to fix their resting bitch face\n\n\u201cAlthough the term RBF entered the cultural lexicon about six years ago, requests for the procedure \u2018more than doubled\u2019 over the last year,\u201d one plastic surgeon told the New York Post. News which should probably give you active rage face.\n\nRise in women trying to self-induce abortions\n\nAs abortion restrictions tighten in the US, a new report from Guttmacher suggests more women are turning to DIY abortions. According to NPR, \u201cthe organization\u2019s latest survey on abortion rates, from 2017, found that 18% of nonhospital facilities said they had treated at least one person for an attempted self-induced abortion, up from 12% when the data were last collected, in 2014\u201d.\n\nThe not-so-naked ambition of Succession\u2019s women\n\nThe second season of Succession, the extremely bingeable HBO drama, is \u201cturning out to be a complicated portrayal of what female power looks like in a business world ruled almost entirely by men,\u201d writes Emily Peck at HuffPo. Not only does it \u201ceasily pass the Bechdel test\u201d, the women in Succession keep their kit on. \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in having people take their clothes off, particularly women,\u201d one of the show\u2019s writers told the Ringer.\n\nTen women accuse Disney of systemic gender discrimination\n\nLet\u2019s hope there\u2019s a fairytale ending to this lawsuit and Disney starts treating its female employees fairly.\n\n\u2018Feminist emergency\u2019 demonstrations in Spain\n\nWomen took to the streets of Spain on Friday to declare a \u201cfeminist emergency\u201d after a summer which saw a spike in gender-based violence.\n\nTeen TikTok tampon trick\n\nTeenage girls on the social network TikTok are punking guys into thinking they eat their used tampons to reabsorb the blood. \u201cIt it seems a lot of boys on the app can\u2019t quite work out if it\u2019s true or not,\u201d BuzzFeed reports.\n\nMark Ronson \u2018comes out\u2019 as a sapiosexual\n\nHe made this momentous announcement on Good Morning Britain. I think writer Shon Faye summed this whole thing up pretty well when she tweeted: \u201cMark Ronson is sapiosexual which means he\u2019s attracted to people for their intellect. Which is cool. And I\u2019m glad he\u2019s found so many beautiful women under 35 whose intellect he\u2019s attracted to.\u201d", "description": "We live in a society in which sexual violence is so normalized that one in 16 women lost their virginity through rape", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efd719cd14bc9af49f3c0fa417dd1b0fcd29ee6e/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d513b09cf981a75e77d57b8fd857325c", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
