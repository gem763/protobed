White Jr. (D-At Large), who spearheaded the bill, said in his opening remarks. \u201cWhy, then, do they lose the right to vote?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nActivists say the 1955 law that prevents imprisoned felons from voting disproportionately affects communities of color in the District, where more than 90 percent of the incarcerated population is black. About 6,000 D.C. residents are currently incarcerated in federal facilities.\n\nSamuel Buggs, an affordable housing advocate and resident of Jubilee Housing, was among several ex-offenders who testified at the hearing. He recounted his experiences of being arrested at age 16 and charged with two armed robberies and use of heroin.\n\n\u201cApart from the hurt I caused to those around me . . . The thing that weighed heavily on my spirit is that I gave up the possibility to vote,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nThe issue gained national attention in April when a question on prisoner voting at a CNN town hall drew disparate answers from the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he believes \u201cevery single person does have the right to vote,\u201d but others were more skeptical, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg firmly disagreeing.\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump and others have blasted prisoner voting, suggesting that Democrats would restore the vote to the Boston Marathon bomber and others serving sentences for heinous crimes.\n\nThe District already has some of the most progressive laws governing the voting rights of those facing incarceration. Along with 14 other states, the District automatically restores voting rights to felons upon release from prison, and individuals incarcerated for misdemeanor crimes can vote from prison.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think this is all that controversial in D.C.,\u201d said council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), who chairs the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHere, we feel strongly about the right to vote,\u201d Allen said, referencing the District\u2019s lack of representation in Congress, which local lawmakers have long campaigned to change. \u201cWe take seriously what we believe is a fundamental right \u2014 the right to representation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhite agreed, adding that he has been \u201creally surprised\u201d by how smooth-sailing the process has been.\n\nThe bill was co-introduced in June by all 13 members of the D.C. Council and, according to White, has received little pushback. A spokesman for Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said in a statement Thursday that the mayor \u201cwants to involve everybody in the franchise\u201d but stopped short of saying whether Bowser explicitly supports the legislation.\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office, which serves as both the local and the federal prosecutor for the District, declined to comment.\n\nMidway through the public hearing, Allen acknowledged that support for the bill seemed \u201coverwhelming\u201d and urged witnesses to discuss issues surrounding the implementation of the bill, such as whether violent offenders should be excluded.\n\nAD\n\nThe panel, which comprised a mix of public witnesses, activists and local officials, responded with a resounding no.\n\n\u201cThere should be no carve-outs,\u201d said Blair Bowie, legal counsel at the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center. \u201cThis is a really slippery road.\u201d\n\nBoth White and Allen said moving forward, the council will focus on how, rather than whether, to restore the vote to imprisoned felons.\n\nAD\n\nLike all other D.C. legislation, the bill, if passed, would be subject to congressional review. White said he is confident the legislation will become law.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not out of line with the rest of the country here,\u201d he said. \u201cJust ahead of the curve.\u201d\n\nA second public hearing on the issue is scheduled for Oct. 29 at 6 p.m., at the R.I.S.E Demonstration Center at 2730 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. SE.\n\nAD", "description": "If passed, it could make the District the first jurisdiction nationally to restore the vote to felons.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iocFaCtPK8VvfxoyaqyOiRA8L2w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LZH4VKUSAUI6TFLKRDBJDK24HA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
