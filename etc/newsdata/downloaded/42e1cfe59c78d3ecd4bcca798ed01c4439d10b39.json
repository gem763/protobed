Now officials are apologizing.", "language": "en", "text": "MyKayla McCann was shocked by what she discovered at her first day of work.\n\nUsing confidential medical records, her new co-workers at St. Mary\u2019s Regional Medical Center in Lewiston, Maine, had created an ersatz collage that was hidden on the inside of a cabinet door and labeled it the \u201cWall of Shame.\u201d The records belonged to the hospital\u2019s physically and mentally disabled patients, and described their \u201csexual activity, genital dysfunction, bowel movements, bodily odors and other personal maladies,\u201d according to a 2018 report from Maine\u2019s Human Rights Commission, which labeled the collage \u201cobjectively offensive.\u201d\n\nThe alarming discovery was the start of a years-long saga that would ultimately lead the commission to determine that McCann was subjected to a hostile work environment, where hospital staffers violated patient privacy laws to look up her medical records, and discriminated against her because of her own disability. Now, after a report on the findings in the Bangor Daily News, officials have issued a public apology, telling local media outlets on Thursday that the hospital is \u201cfully committed to ensuring this doesn\u2019t happen again.\"\n\nRecords obtained by the Daily News and Lewiston Sun Journal show that the Wall of Shame contained graphic and deeply personal medical records, including photos of unnamed patients\u2019 genitalia and diagnoses like \u201cbutt wounds\u201d and \u201csour smell of vagina.\u201d The collage, a state investigator wrote, was \u201cintended to demean and humiliate and included supposed \u2018jokes\u2019 \u201d about patients with disabilities.\n\nMcCann, who began working as a lab technician at the hospital in June 2015, initially didn\u2019t say anything about the Wall of Shame because she was new on the job and feared that she, too, could become a target for mockery. She had previously been treated by the hospital for conditions related to a disability, the details of which are redacted in official documents, but hadn\u2019t told anyone when she applied for the job.\n\nYet, her co-workers seemed to find out anyway. In April 2016, McCann took a leave of absence to deal with health concerns. She told the commission that she specifically chose to be treated at hospitals other than the one where she worked out of fear that her colleagues would find out and mock her. When she returned to work, she noticed her co-workers treating her differently.\n\nIn particular, McCann said, three of her fellow laboratory technicians started asking her the kind of questions \u2014 \u201cDo you drink and drive?\u201d and \u201cDo you party a lot?\u201d \u2014 that gave her reason to suspect that they had looked at the medical records that were on file for her at St. Mary\u2019s.\n\nAccording to the commission\u2019s report, McCann went to hospital administrators in the fall of 2016, mentioning both her suspicion that her colleagues had been digging into her private medical files and her concerns about the Wall of Shame. But higher-ups were slow to take action. Though the hospital claimed the offensive collage was dealt with in a \u201cmatter of weeks,\u201d McCann had photographic evidence to the contrary, showing that it was still in place in December 2016, several months after she first complained.\n\nMeanwhile, the hospital\u2019s IT department conducted its own investigation and confirmed that three of McCann\u2019s colleagues had been snooping in her medical records. One of the technicians was fired, and two others were disciplined. But that made matters even worse, McCann said in her complaint, because her remaining co-workers blamed her and began talking behind her back. She quit her job in January 2017, citing \u201cthe hostile work environment and the numerous HIPAA violations that I have repeatedly reported,\u201d and filed a complaint with the Maine Human Rights Commission the next month.\n\nA state investigator determined that McCann had indeed been subjected to a hostile work environment, and had been targeted on the basis of her disabilities when co-workers looked up her private records. Though she wasn\u2019t personally featured on the Wall of Shame, the fact that her colleagues \u201cconstructed a workplace display ridiculing patients with disabilities\u201d that she saw every day amounted to pervasive harassment, the report states.\n\nThe investigator also observed that McCann seemed deeply distressed by her experience and \u201cpresented as anxious to an extreme,\u201d but rejected the former lab technician\u2019s claim that she had faced retaliation, noting that office gossip wasn\u2019t the same thing as harassment. Last January, the commission unanimously voted in support of the investigator\u2019s findings.\n\nIn June, the commission voted against filing its own lawsuit against the hospital, leaving it up to McCann to determine if she wants to pursue litigation. Her attorneys have yet to comment on whether that is likely to happen.\n\nThough McCann\u2019s complaint and the commission\u2019s report were a matter of public record, it wasn\u2019t until Wednesday that the Daily News publicized the disturbing findings. In a joint statement to the newspaper and other Maine media outlets, Steven Jorgensen, the president of St. Mary\u2019s Health System, and Stephen Grubbs, the president and CEO of the hospital\u2019s parent organization, Covenant Health, said that administrators had found \u201cno other breaches in patient privacy\u201d beyond those detailed in the commission\u2019s report. Hospital officials also told the Sun Journal on Thursday that none of the documents posted on the Wall of Shame revealed a patient\u2019s identity.\n\n\u201cThis incident is troubling,\u201d Grubbs said in a statement. \u201cI am confident however that it is not reflective of the greater St. Mary\u2019s family, which is deeply caring and committed to serving every member of our community with empathy and compassion.\u201d", "description": "A collage taped inside a cabinet at St. Mary\u2019s Regional Medical Center in Lewiston, Maine, featured the confidential medical records of mentally and physically disabled patients, according to a complaint upheld by the Maine Human Rights Commission.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix", "October At Am", "Antonia Noori Farzan Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
