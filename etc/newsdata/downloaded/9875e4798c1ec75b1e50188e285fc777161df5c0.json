(Getty) More\n\nHe initially claimed to ex-girlfriend Shannon Davies that Mikayla became sleepy and unresponsive as he went downstairs to feed her at their Inverness home.\n\nBut phone records later revealed Haining had made four internet searches during this time, trying to find out information about babies being in a coma and querying: \u201cWhat happens if a newborn baby is shake (sic) hard?\u201d\n\nParamedics were called and took her to hospital where she was placed in intensive care with a ventilator, having suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of the head trauma.\n\nLater that afternoon, the baby was taken off life support and placed into her mother\u2019s arms where she passed away at 4.46pm.\n\nREAD MORE FROM YAHOO NEWS UK:\n\nAfter two years of denying he had killed his daughter, Crown prosecutors accepted a guilty plea from Haining to the charge of culpable homicide on September 5.\n\nShelagh McCall QC, representing Haining, told the court on Tuesday he was prepared for a lengthy time in jail and that he now \u201chated\u201d himself.\n\nShe claimed the killer panicked after the event but he now wishes he had come clean about his actions sooner.\n\nMs McCall said: \u201cHe described himself as reflecting that he should have manned up at that time and told the truth, as a clear acknowledgement from Mr Haining that he was solely responsible for what happened and that he ought to have told the truth far sooner than he did.\u201d\n\nThe court heard he inflicted \u201ccatastrophic\u201d brain injuries on his daughter after a \u201closs of control\u201d More\n\nShe added: \u201cHe is preparing for a significant custodial sentence, he feels this is justified due to the severity of his actions, stating that he is disgusted with himself, that he hated himself for what he has done.\u201d\n\nThe court heard the 21-year-old had a troubled upbringing and a history of violence as a teenager, although he had no previous criminal convictions.\n\nJudge Lord Pentland said: \u201cIn the early hours of June 8 2017 you killed your baby daughter Mikayla.\n\n\u201cI use the term \u2018killed\u2019 advisably, as the Crown has accepted your late plea of guilty to culpable homicide and not to insist on the original more serious allegation of murder, on the basis you didn\u2019t deliberately intend to kill Mikayla.\n\n\u201cMikayla was 23 days old. She was in your sole care at the time of her death.\n\n\u201cYou shook her, causing her head to strike the door that she was so severely injured that she later died.\u201d\n\nHaining was sentenced to eight years in prison, backdated to September 11, which the judge said that would have been nine years if it had gone to trial.", "description": "Thomas Haining was said to have inflicted \u201ccatastrophic\u201d brain injuries on baby Mikayla.", "authors": ["George Martin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pYAmrNs1UJoZIW1e46JjFg--~B/aD0xNDgwO3c9MjE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/5d24cd80-ef3c-11e9-afd6-6d6331ff4af4", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
