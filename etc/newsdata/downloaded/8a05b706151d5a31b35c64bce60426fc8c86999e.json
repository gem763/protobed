Written when the New Zealand singer was 19, it is the sound of someone still in the heady mess of it all. But there\u2019s something just as poignant about revisiting the forest fire of adolescence \u2013 a time when you feel at once invisible and invincible \u2013 from a safe distance. Which is exactly what Tegan and Sara have done.\n\nFor their ninth album, Hey I\u2019m Just Like You, the Canadian duo have re-recorded songs they put on cassette tapes when they were still in high school \u2013 tapes that sat abandoned for two decades, only to be unearthed when the duo came to write their new book, High School. They weren\u2019t yet the queer icons they are today \u2013 in fact, they were \u201cdirtbags\u201d, says Sara Quin in the album\u2019s press notes, \u201cstoned on acid, sneaking out, skipping school, lying to our parents\u201d. They were closeted, too, isolated by their own repressed sexuality, and several tracks on the record \u2013 the synth-poppy \u201cI Don\u2019t Owe You Anything\u201d and the spiky, guitar-laden \u201cI Know I\u2019m Not The Only One\u201d \u2013 are about furtive relationships with girls.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nTegan and Sara\u2019s last album, 2016\u2019s Love You To Death, was a bold stadium-pop record; this one is less polished, but just as punchy. The twins grew up on a diet of Nineties grunge and west coast punk, and though the new songs are reimagined \u2013 the instrumentations bigger and plusher than their teen tape efforts \u2013 they still pay homage to their early influences. \u201cDon\u2019t Believe The Things They Tell You They Lie\u201d is as furiously dramatic as its title suggests, all bashed-out drum fills and Rancid guitars, and \u201cI\u2019ll Be Back Someday\u201d is fuzzy and scrungy, with a riff that sounds like Hoku\u2019s \u201cPerfect Day\u201d. Meanwhile, \u201cWe Don\u2019t Have Fun When We\u2019re Together Anymore\u201d, a song about growing so far apart from your friends that you begin to resent them, is fidgety and hyperactive.\n\nThey are more restrained elsewhere. On \u201cHello I\u2019m Right Here\u201d, written for a high school muse who rejected Sara with the crushing words, \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way about girls\u201d, gloomy piano is slowly joined by plush, graceful strings. \u201cI\u2019m young but it\u2019s hard to believe that someday I will never see you again,\u201d she sings, \u201cand you might not believe but you\u2019ve changed me so much.\u201d\n\nMost people read their teenage diary and cringe. With Hey I\u2019m Just Like You, Tegan and Sara have painstakingly, tenderly, written theirs out again.", "description": "Lorde\u2019s 2017 album Melodrama is one of the most painfully precise evocations of teenagehood around.
