Had a player tweeted what Morey did, James surely wouldn\u2019t have suggested any discipline\u2014even if James himself were frustrated with being put in the middle of the resulting controversy. On Twitter, James tried to further explain his position, but given the seriousness of the situation in Hong Kong, I doubt many fans were receptive to him explaining how this created a challenging week for the players who were in China as everything unfolded. The Hong Kong protesters were definitely aware of James\u2019s opinions. His comments so angered them that they burned his jersey\u2014something American fans have done when angry at James, but for much different reasons.\n\nMorey likely didn\u2019t anticipate that his tweet would practically destroy his team\u2019s relationship with China. He probably also couldn\u2019t have foreseen how much his tweet would potentially sabotage players\u2019 business interests in China. An unnamed Lakers player, sources told ESPN, lost out on a $1 million endorsement opportunity with a Chinese company because of Morey\u2026\n\nBy painting Morey as the villain, though, James is giving the Chinese government a free pass for its heavy-handed, petty overreaction. After all, Morey\u2019s show of support for the Hong Kong protesters was just one tweet; it was hardly Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail.\u201d It looked as if the Chinese government just used the tweet to show the NBA who has the upper hand in their relationship.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jemele Hill", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Lebron-James-Cant-Fix-Nbas-China-Problem"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
