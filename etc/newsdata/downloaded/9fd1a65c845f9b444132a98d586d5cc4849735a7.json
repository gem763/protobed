(Library of Congress)\n\nThe attack on the Washington Monument began just after midnight.\n\nNine men snuck up to what was still a construction zone, the tower reaching just more than 170 feet. They poisoned a guard dog. They tied up the night watchman.\n\nAnd then they hunted for the pope\u2019s stone.\n\nThe brazen attack on the monument in March 1854 was a coordinated effort by the Know-Nothing party, an anti-Catholic, anti-immigration group that feared Pope Pius IX had plans to take over the United States. (Members replied \u201cI know nothing\u201d anytime anyone asked them a question. Frustrating.)\n\nThe Know-Nothings were nervous that the pope, like other foreign and religious leaders, had sent a slab of marble to be placed inside the monument, which reopened to the public Thursday amid much fanfare after damage from a 2011 earthquake.\n\n[David Rubenstein spent $10 million on the Washington Monument, which reopens Thursday.]\n\nAfter they snatched the stone, they reportedly loaded it into a rowboat and dumped it in the Potomac River. (At least that was the story a \u201csaloon keeper\u201d later told The Washington Post, requesting anonymity.)\n\nThe attack could not have come at a worse time. The Washington National Monument Society, a private organization raising funds for the project, was out of cash. Soliciting stone donations from states and foreign governments was the 1850s version of a Kickstarter campaign. But it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nThe stubby, uncompleted monument became a national eyesore. A year after the attack, the society asked Congress for money to complete the project. Congress was on board, approving $200,000, the equivalent of $6.1 million in today\u2019s George Washingtons.\n\n\n\nThe Washington Monument under construction. (Library of Congress)\n\nYou know who wasn\u2019t happy with Congress stepping in? The Know-Nothings. According to the National Park Service\u2019s history:\n\nThe night before, however, a group of about 750 members of the Know-Nothings, many of whom had joined the Washington National Monument Society, called a meeting. They voted 17 of their own officers into the Society, and the next morning announced that they were in possession of the Washington Monument.\n\nCongress tabled the resolution. Two weeks later, the project\u2019s architect, Robert Mills, died. And you know what the Know-Nothings did next? Essentially nothing. They added three feet to the monument. Three feet!\n\nIn 1858, as the Know-Nothings self-combusted, the original society wrestled back total control. Then the women stepped in, with several founding the Ladies Washington National Monument Society, an offshoot of the original group.\n\n\u201cThe Ladies society was, in short, having as much trouble prying open American wallets as their male colleagues,\u201d wrote John Lockwood in \u201cThe Men \u2014 and the Women \u2014 Who Built the Washington Monument.\u201d\n\nIn 1860, the women reported raising a whopping $154.46. Then the Civil War broke out. The country had bigger problems than this stubby structure, which now stood paused at 176 feet. The whole neighborhood took a turn for the worse.\n\n[Photos: See the view from the newly reopened Washington Monument]\n\n\u201cFollowing the Civil War, the swamp-like grounds of the Washington Monument became known as \u2018Murderer\u2019s Row\u2019 as they became the hangout of escapees, deserters and all other types of flotsam of the war,\u201d according to the National Park Service.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1876, amid a patriotic wave leading up to the country\u2019s first Centennial, that Congress passed a law allowing construction to resume. On Dec. 6, 1884, construction was completed, with the tip of the obelisk reaching 555 feet.\n\nThe dedication took place the next year, the day before Washington\u2019s Birthday, which fell on a Sunday. The Park Service\u2019s history described the moment:\n\nWashington\u2019s birthday that year was clear and cold, and the sharp wind blowing down the Potomac chilled the assembled crowd. The ground at the base of the majestic shaft was encrusted with snow. But it was a great day for the men who spent years completing the monument, as the obelisk to the Father of his Country stood noble, proud, majestic and serene. It represented the ideals of America.\n\nAnd it was the tallest building in the world \u2014 until the Eiffel Tower in Paris knocked it off that pedestal.\n\n\n\nClouds roll above the Washington Monument, which is scheduled to reopen to the public Thursday.
