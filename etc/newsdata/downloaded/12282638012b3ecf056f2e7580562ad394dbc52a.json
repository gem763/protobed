The essence of the process is this: Some genes confer beneficial traits. Those traits make their owners more likely to survive and reproduce in a given environment. Over time, those genes and traits become more common. So researchers might, for example, find genes behind certain traits (such as striped coats). Or they might link certain traits to success in a given environment (such as longer-legged lizards in hurricane-hit islands). Beyond some experiments with lab-grown microbes, they have rarely connected all the dots together.\n\nThat\u2019s what Barrett accomplished. With hundreds of mice and years of research, he and his colleagues were able to show and measure, in the real world, \u201cthe full process of evolution by natural selection,\u201d says Hopi Hoekstra of Harvard University, who led the study. \u201cIt\u2019s all in one.\u201d\n\nIt was also a pain in the ass. \u201cUtter ignorance was a good thing,\u201d said Barrett, who had, until this point, only ever worked with small fish. \u201cAnyone who had worked with mice would have never attempted this.\u201d\n\ncredit: Rowan Barrett\n\nOnce the team had Bill Ward on board, they ended up buying 30,000 pounds of stainless steel plates from a local hardware store, and carting them over to the farm using flatbeds and forklifts. There, they erected the plates in trenches two feet deep, creating square enclosures that were 164 feet across on each side. They built three such pens on light sand, and three on dark soil.\n\nAt first, the steel pens seemed to work. Mice could neither dig beneath the plates nor climb over them. They were, however, exceptionally good at sneaking through gaps where adjacent plates didn\u2019t quite meet, so the team had to dig everything back up and pour concrete around the joints.\n\nNature itself seemed eager to select against the team. On one trip, high winds almost flipped the truck carrying the steel plates. Once, a team member fainted and cut himself on a piece of steel. During winter, ramps of snow would accumulate along the walls, so the team had to add an extra layer of mesh along the plates. They also had to catch all the rattlesnakes in the enclosures and throw them over the walls; Bill helped. \u201cEverything goes wrong in the field,\u201d Hoekstra says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re used to dealing with pipettes, not backhoes.\u201d\n\nWhen everything was finally set, the team evicted every mouse already inside the enclosures, and caught around 500 more from the surrounding hills. They photographed each rodent, took a DNA sample, implanted a tiny radio chip between its shoulders, and released it into one of the enclosures.\n\nAs time passed, many of the mice fell prey to owls, but after three months, the team returned and recaptured the ones that were left. Sure enough, they found that, compared with the average founding rodents, the average survivors were noticeably lighter in the light-sand enclosures, and darker in the dark-soil ones. Through the deaths of the most conspicuous individuals, the survivors from two initially identical populations had shifted in different directions thanks to their different environments. \u201cIt\u2019s intuitive that if you match your background, you\u2019re more likely to survive,\u201d Hoekstra says. \u201cBut that\u2019s been a just-so story for years.\u201d This experiment showed that it matters\u2014a lot.", "description": "By placing wild mice in large outdoor enclosures, an ambitious team of scientists has illustrated the full process of natural selection in a single study.", "authors": ["Ed Yong"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/01/5907607580_da47cdab55_o/facebook.jpg?1548973614", "published_at": "2019-01-31"}
