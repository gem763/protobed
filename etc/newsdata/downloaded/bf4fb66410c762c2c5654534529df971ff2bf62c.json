Tuukka Rask stopped 16 shots in net.\n\nPastrnak extended his points streak to 10 games (12 goals, 12 assists), Brad Marchand had an assist to increase his run to 11 straight (seven goals, 14 assists) and Krejci also had an assist in his first game off the injured list.\n\nBrent Burns scored a goal, and Martin Jones made 36 saves for the Sharks, who are on an 1-4-1 skid.\n\nEntering the contest, San Jose had killed 93.2 percent of its short-handed situations. Boston's power play was No. 2 in the league, scoring on 32.4 percent of its chances.\n\nThe Bruins struck on their first man advantage at 7:49, Pastrnak sniping the puck off a feed from Patrice Bergeron, who had faked as if he were going to shoot. The goal held up upon a challenge for offside.\n\nBoston scored again on a power play late in the period, Krejci converting at 17:51 from nearly the same area of the left circle as Pastrnak. Krejci had missed the previous five contests with an upper-body injury.\n\nThe Sharks got within 2-1 on a Burns power-play marker at 1:31 of the second, but the Bruins scored three more in the period to put the game away.\n\nCoyle's goal at 5:21 came less than a minute after a power play ended, with the Sharks still vulnerable. Just over three minutes later, David Backes found Wagner streaking up ice, and Wagner converted the breakaway with a backhand through the five-hole at 8:31. Carlo struck with 3:10 remaining in the period.\n\nIn a testy third period, three Bruins (Backes, Marchand and Brett Ritchie) and three Sharks (Logan Couture, Barclay Goodrow and Evander Kane) were assessed misconduct penalties, and San Jose coach Peter DeBoer was ejected.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "The Boston Bruins scored two first-period power-play goals against the  league's top penalty-killing unit and never looked back, beating the visiting  San...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
