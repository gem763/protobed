Though the Browns (1-2) have not yet lived up to expectations, they can earn a share of the top spot with a victory.\n\nSure, it\u2019s early. But a defeat will put Cleveland two games behind Baltimore (2-1) and in an all-too-familiar position: closer to last place than first.\n\n\u201cBaltimore has kind of been in the mix every year for so long, and they\u2019re the defending champs,\u201d Browns coach Freddie Kitchens said. \u201cSo, until somebody beats them, that\u2019s what it is.\u201d\n\nDespite winning the AFC North last year, the Ravens were considered by some to be an afterthought behind a Cleveland team that appeared poised for greatness after a lengthy run of miserable seasons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hype. You can\u2019t really buy into it,\u201d Baltimore defensive tackle Brandon Williams said. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know what a team is until you see them on Sunday. So, once somebody gets hit in the mouth, what\u2019s the plan then?\u201d\n\nThe plan, Mayfield says, \u201cis finding out what is going on, eliminating the mistakes and playing to our strengths. The defense is playing great. It is our job to pick it up.\u201d\n\nSome things to know about the latest installment in the Browns-Ravens rivalry, in which Baltimore has gone 30-10:\n\nDOUBLE TROUBLE\n\nBeckham had the best game of his career in his only matchup against Baltimore.\n\n\u201cYeah, they played a lot of one-high man to man,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t happen much. I get man to man, I\u2019m just too confident in me - I\u2019m going to win.\u201d\n\nBeckham won a lot on Oct. 16, 2016, when he had eight catches for 222 yards and two touchdowns in his only game against the Ravens for the New York Giants. The three-time Pro Bowler has been frustrated by double-teams so far with the Browns.\n\nJACKSON\u2019S STREAK\n\nLamar Jackson has thrown for seven touchdowns this season for Baltimore and fired 221 straight passes without an interception.\n\nAsked about it in the middle of the week, the second-year quarterback said, \u201cThat\u2019s my job. I\u2019m not trying to throw any interceptions. Don\u2019t jinx me, though.\u201d\n\nJackson was limited to 267 yards on a career-high 43 attempts last week in a 33-28 loss at Kansas City.\n\nWALK THE TALK\n\nWilliams wasn\u2019t the only member of the Ravens who grew tired of hearing all the preseason hype about the Browns.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just kind of the narrative the media created,\u201d running back Mark Ingram said. \u201cYou have to play football at the end of the day. You could have as many players as you want to on paper, but if the guys don\u2019t mesh and they don\u2019t communicate well, they don\u2019t play well together, it really doesn\u2019t mean anything.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to see them twice, so that\u2019s why you line up and kick it off. That\u2019s why you line up and play football, to settle the score.\u201d\n\nBACKFIELD BURNED\n\nA thinner Ravens defensive coordinator Don Martindale addressed the media this week after watching the tape of Patrick Mahomes\u2019 dominant effort (27 for 37, 374 yards, 3 TDs) for the Chiefs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over. It\u2019s over. We\u2019re on to the Browns,\u201d Martindale said. \u201cI lost 4 pounds this week because I had to watch it three times and I threw up all three times.\u201d\n\nOFFENSIVE WOES\n\nCleveland\u2019s talented offense has yet to shift into high gear.\n\nMayfield is ranked 32nd in passer rating (70.3) and 30th in completion rate (56.9 percent) through three games. The Browns are tied for 27th in points (16.3) and 24th in yards (330.3) per game.\n\nIt has not gone according to plan, but Mayfield believes the Browns are on the brink of a breakthrough.\n\n\u201cI think we are very close to putting together the game that our offense needs to have,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody doing their job on every play. Stuff is going to happen during the game and you are going to have to adjust, but I think we are very close.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tom Withers in Berea, Ohio, contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Since their return to the NFL in 1999 as the reincarnation of the Browns, underachieving Cleveland has sought to play the spoiler role against the franchise that Art Modell took from the city to start anew in Baltimore.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginsburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/browns_ravens_football_21769_c0-116-2775-1733_s1770x1032.jpg?ae9590d7b932be4e79a03a91fd86693387391de4", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
