It must shake us all and force us to mobilize,\u201d Conte said, The Guardian reported.\n\nAccording to BBC News, the entire Mont Blanc massif has 11 peaks of about 4,000 meters in France and Italy, and attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists each year.\n\nScientists believe that a warming climate is contributing to the melt of glaciers worldwide. In addition, a heatwave across Europe over the summer is said to have influenced melt speed.\n\nLast week, hundreds gathered for a funeral for the Pizol glacier in Switzerland's Glarus Alps. That glacier has lost up to 90 percent of its volume since 2006.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Scientists warned on Tuesday that a portion of the massive Mont Blanc glacier is in danger of collapse, prompting Italian authorities to close off roads and evacuate certain areas.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Planpincieux-glacier-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
