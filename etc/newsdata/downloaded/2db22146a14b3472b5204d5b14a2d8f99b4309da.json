Photo: Melinda Sue Gordon/Netflix\n\nThis piece is frequently updated as titles leave and join Netflix. *New additions are indicated with an asterisk.\n\nSometimes you just need to escape. You just want to watch things blow up or crash into each other, but it seems like Netflix is always trying to push a serious drama or docuseries on you. Just give me something that goes boom!\n\nWell, we can help you with that. Here are the best choices you could make with a working Netflix subscription if you\u2019re jonesing to see a great action movie.\n\n*300\n\nIs this Gerard Butler\u2019s best film? What if it\u2019s Zack Snyder\u2019s too? We won\u2019t get into what\u2019s happened to their careers over the years but it\u2019s certainly a movie that made them stars. In Snyder\u2019s adaptation of the Frank Miller comic series, Butler is a charismatic action hero, playing King Leonidas, the man who led 300 Spartans into battle against the Persians. The plot doesn\u2019t really matter as much as the alpha male energy of it all, and the style that has influenced dozens of movies since.\n\nThe Age of Shadows\n\nIf you don\u2019t know the name Kim Jee-woon, you should really acquaint yourself with more Korean cinema, as he\u2019s one of the country\u2019s most consistent filmmakers. His A Tale of Two Sisters is a horror-movie classic, and The Good, The Bad, The Weird is the dream Western fu movie you never knew you needed. And anyone who has seen I Saw the Devil will never forget it. None of those are on Netflix, but you can find his incredibly ambitious 2016 period action piece starring the wonderful Song Kang-ho. There\u2019s actually a pretty robust Asian cinema selection on Netflix, and this is one you should seek out.\n\nThe Bank Job\n\nLong before Hobbs & Shaw, Jason Statham\u2019s career was greatly elevated by this 2008 Roger Donaldson movie, which proved the actor had much more range and charisma than even what he\u2019d shown in The Transporter flicks and the films he made with buddy Guy Ritchie. Statham\u2019s work in this tight, smart thriller for adults \u2014 a genre that doesn\u2019t really exist anymore \u2014 remains one of his best performances.\n\nBlack Panther\n\nTake advantage of this opportunity before Disney+ guts all the Marvel and Disney movie options from every streaming service on the planet. The first MCU movie to win an Oscar is one of the best superhero movies of all time, and a movie that holds up incredibly well on repeat viewing. This isn\u2019t just an action movie, it\u2019s a cultural event \u2014 something that redefined and reshaped the superhero genre for the rest of time.\n\nCloverfield\n\nJ.J. Abrams redefined viral marketing for his production of Matt Reeves\u2019s monster movie, a flick that came literally out of nowhere and built buzz in mysterious, fascinating ways. The first trailer had no title! By the time the movie came out in January of 2008, the hype machine was in full effect, and the movie (mostly) lived up to it. Some people still argue about how little of the monster the flick actually shows, but it\u2019s a much tighter, tauter action flick than you may remember.\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\nAng Lee\u2019s martial arts epic was an absolute phenomenon when it came out, domestically grossing more than any foreign language film in history on its way to ten Academy Award nominations. It\u2019s held up marvelously, a cinematic explosion of color and passion for filmmaking. If you haven\u2019t seen it since it took the world by storm, it\u2019s time for a rewatch.\n\nThe Crow\n\nArguably as much of a horror movie as it is an action movie, one of the reasons this flick was so popular was the way it straddled multiple genres, willing to go dark with the story of a rock musician returned from the dead in search of vengeance. Stylish, dark, and tragic due to the death of its star, this is a movie that everyone had to see when it came out a quarter century ago. You may not have seen it since. You\u2019re due for a revisit.\n\nEquilibrium\n\nA massive bomb when it was released (it didn\u2019t even break $6 million), Kurt Wimmer\u2019s stylish 2002 sci-fi action flick gained a following on DVD. Starring Christian Bale, Emily Watson, and Taye Diggs, it\u2019s one of many films that tried to emulate the stylish, Asian-influenced action of The Matrix, but it\u2019s also one of the most successful in that regard, filled with memorable action sequences that incorporate martial arts and gunplay. Sure, it\u2019s derivative of a lot of better films and pieces of literature, but it\u2019s also a heck of a lot of fun.\n\nFearless\n\nArguably Jet Li\u2019s last great film, this 2006 Ronny Yu joint is one of the last gasps of a series of international martial arts hits that came in the wake of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. There was a time when audiences were so open to this kind of filmmaking that Fearless was actually one of the ten highest-grossing foreign language films of all time in the U.S. It\u2019s a great example of Li at his most charismatic, while also understanding the transcendent beauty of a great piece of martial arts choreography.\n\nHellboy\n\nNo, not the 2019 box-office and critical bomb, the 2004 Guillermo del Toro adaptation that actually understood its source material and its audience. Ron Perlman stars in this one, based on the iconic character created by Mike Mignola. Perlman is a lot of fun, but what works about this is the flair and craftsmanship brought to it by del Toro, a man whose passion for filmmaking is contagious.\n\nHot Fuzz\n\nOne of the best comedies of the aughts works so well because it both satirizes and adores action-movie clich\u00e9s at the same time. Before Edgar Wright made Baby Driver, he directed Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in this perfect comedy about a small British town with a deep secret. And a love for Point Break and Bad Boys.\n\nIncredibles 2\n\nWhile Disney works to get its upcoming streaming service off the ground, it\u2019s still regularly releasing new hits to Netflix, including the beloved sequel to one of the most popular Pixar films of all time. Brad Bird\u2019s long-awaited sequel is one of the top films of 2018, and arguably its best animated film (at least that\u2019s not about Spider-Man).\n\nIndiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of Steven Spielberg on Netflix, but this is one of the best choices you could make from the filmography of one of the best American filmmakers. Maybe you\u2019ve heard of it? All four Indy films are actually still on Netflix. Do a marathon while you still can. Yes, you can skip the last one if you want.\n\nKing Kong\n\nPeter Jackson used the incredible power given to him by the commercial and artistic success of The Lord of the Rings trilogy to remake one of his favorite films of all time, the 1933 monster-movie classic, King Kong. While this movie made a fortune, it\u2019s kind of been forgotten by history, which is a shame. It\u2019s a rock-solid action-adventure movie made by someone who clearly loves the genre. Most of all, it\u2019s just fun, which is something more modern monster movies could stand to remember to be.\n\nKung Fu Hustle\n\nYou have likely never seen a movie quite like this 2004 martial arts action-comedy, Stephen Chow\u2019s masterpiece. Set in 1940s China, this worldwide hit features some of the best stunt work you can find on Netflix, all in service of a movie that often plays like a live-action cartoon. It\u2019s ridiculous and unforgettable.\n\nLogan\u2019s Run\n\nThere isn\u2019t a lot of action on Netflix made before 1999, so take the chance to watch this genre classic from all the way back in 1976. Michael Anderson\u2019s genre hit is a vision of a future in which resources are maintained by killing everyone when they turn 30. As one might imagine, this isn\u2019t that easy to accomplish, and an executor named Logan 5 rebels when his time to be exterminated comes up. Winner of a special Oscar for visual effects, this is a film that feels influential now in terms of sci-fi and action.\n\n*The Lord of the Rings Trilogy\n\nIt\u2019s kind of amazing that what was once one of the biggest theatrical events of all time can now be watched on your phone. The original, Oscar-winning trilogy \u2013 The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, Return of the King \u2013 have all dropped on Netflix, and it\u2019s time for you revisit the Shire. These films have held up beautifully, still a great example of how movie magic can transport to fantasy worlds. If you haven\u2019t seen them since they ruled the cinematic ring, it\u2019s time to rejoin the fellowship.\n\nThe Mummy\n\nThere was a brief window in movie history in which it looked like Brendan Fraser was going to be the biggest action star in the world, following the release of this beloved 1999 hit, a flick that made over $400 million worldwide and launched a franchise. It\u2019s telling that none of the reboots of Universal horror movies have really worked since then. None of have found the same charm, wit, and clever action choreography that Stephen Sommers & Co. figured out two decades ago.\n\nSherlock Holmes\n\nWho\u2019s ready for Sherlock Holmes to return? People were surprised when it was announced that Guy Ritchie was getting the gang back together for a third film to be released in 2021, a decade after A Game of Shadows. Netflix recently added the movie that started it all, this 2009 smash hit starring Robert Downey Jr. as the classic crime-solver. Reimagining the deeply intellectual Doyle creation as an action star was a clever move, launching a franchise that\u2019s still humming.\n\nSnowpiercer\n\nBong Joon-ho may have just won the Palme d\u2019Or for Parasite but his most popular film so far remains this 2013 sci-fi action flick starring Chris Evans, Song Kang-ho, Tilda Swinton, Octavia Spencer, and John Hurt. It\u2019s a brilliant allegory for society, as a train has been divided into classes per car, and the peasants form a revolt. Visually striking and narratively ambitious, this is a film that only seems to grow in esteem with each passing year.\n\nSpider-man: Into the Spider-verse\n\nThe Best Animated Film Oscar for 2018 went to this unexpected treat, one of the best superhero movies of the modern era. It\u2019s got a little bit of everything. First, it replicates the comic-book aesthetic in ways we\u2019ve never seen before. Second, it is a leap forward in terms of representation in animated superhero movies. Third, it is just an unbelievable amount of fun, the kind of movie that you can watch again and again. It will hold up for generations to come.\n\nSpy Kids\n\nYes, a kids\u2019 movie can be an action one, too! Robert Rodriguez turned his eye for adult-driven action in films like Desperado to something for the younger set in this clever 2001 box-office smash that started an entire franchise. The kids (Alexa Vega, Daryl Sabara) are great, but it\u2019s how much fun the adults are having, including Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, and Cheech Marin, that really makes the joy of this film infectious.\n\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi\n\nBefore Disney+ runs off with all of the MCU and Lucasfilm movies that it can grab, you should take the chance to watch the few that are just sitting there on Netflix waiting for you to enjoy them. One of the most divisive films of this decade, The Last Jedi spawned an entire industry of online hatred and petitions, but it\u2019s a movie that you should (a) see for yourself, and (b) revisit away from all the hype. You may be surprised.\n\nThor: Ragnarok\n\nTaika Waititi is one of the few filmmakers to make an MCU entry that still has the personality of its creator. The quirky sense of humor that Waititi brought to projects like What We Do in the Shadows is there in the interplay between Thor and Hulk, as well as the creative production design and quirky performances from people like Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum. For some, this MCU flick is a bit too quirky, but at least it\u2019s got some personality.\n\nTrain to Busan\n\nThis South Korean zombie story is truly one of the best movies available to watch on Netflix, regardless of genre. It\u2019s thrilling from start to finish, and the excellent, efficient character development means you feel like you have a stake in everyone involved. Imagine the self-contained maelstrom of Snowpiercer, but with raging undead.\n\nTriple Frontier\n\nJ.C. Chandor\u2019s latest is a solid thriller with a phenomenal ensemble. Oscar Isaac leads a group of soldiers into an illegal job to rip off a notorious drug lord and, well, things don\u2019t go as planned. Not only is everyone here excellent \u2014 especially, Ben Affleck, doing his best work since Gone Girl \u2014 but it\u2019s the kind of tight action movie that Hollywood doesn\u2019t really make that often anymore. It\u2019s a lean, mean fighting machine.\n\nV for Vendetta\n\nJames McTeigue directs this successful adaptation of the David Lloyd and Alan Moore classic about fascism and resistance. Set in a future in which a regime has taken over the United Kingdom, the great Hugo Weaving plays V, a resistance leader who unites the subjugated against their oppressors. With definite echoes of the Wachowskis\u2019 Matrix movies, V for Vendetta has become an iconic, beloved film for good reason.\n\nThe Wandering Earth\n\nOne of the biggest movies of the decade is a Chinese film that most people in the United States haven\u2019t even seen. Making almost $700 million worldwide, this is the kind of blockbuster that the MCU sort of pushed out \u2014 a crazy, end-of-the-world disaster movie with a Roland Emmerich aesthetic and ridiculous special effects. It\u2019s almost overwhelming in its onslaught of crazy, but sometimes you just want to see things go boom on a massive scale.\n\nWanted\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago really that Angelina Jolie was an action star, and this Timur Bekmambetov adaptation of the Mark Millar comic is one of her more successful vehicles. Coming near the end of the Matrix wannabes, this gun fu movie adds its own sense of wicked humor and violent energy to the subgenre, elevated by Jolie, James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman, Terence Stamp, and Common.\n\nThe Wave\n\nDisaster movies aren\u2019t just for Americans anymore! The premise of this is the kind of simple wonder that they used to make in Hollywood more in the \u201970s and \u201980s. An avalanche causes a large enough rockslide into a body of water that it creates a tsunami, and a nervous geologist is one of the few people who knows the carnage that\u2019s about to come. Well-acted and smartly constructed, this is a wonderful slice of disaster escapism.", "description": "Netflix has plenty of action movies to stream, but which ones are worth your time?
