Banners celebrating the birthday of Adolf Hitler and mocking anti-racism campaigns. Bananas thrown at black players by fans of their own team.\n\nIf England thought after their last match in Bulgaria that supporter behaviour there could get no worse than the monkey chanting their players endured that night, the intervening eight years have sadly proven otherwise.\n\nJust how bad the problem has become at national-team level will be laid bare tomorrow evening when Gareth Southgate\u2019s side play their latest European Championship qualifier at a partially closed Vasil Levski Stadium.\n\nThat closure is the heaviest sanction imposed on the Bulgarian Football Union for \u201cracist behaviour\u201d by supporters, one of whom was also ejected from last month\u2019s fixture at Wembley for abusing Raheem Sterling.\n\nFan behaviour is even worse in club football in the country, judging by the number of truly shocking incidents since a previous England Euro qualifier there in 2011.", "description": "A child with a swastika on his bare chest and another giving a Nazi salute.", "authors": ["Ben Rumsby", "Jason Burt", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000001072492-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
