The stadium is too small for me. I'm used to playing in front of 80,000. This is a walk in the park.\n\n\"What happens next year? I don't know. If I stay it will be good for MLS because the whole world will watch it. If I don't stay, nobody will remember what MLS is.\"\n\nNapoli were considered serious contenders to land the former Man Utd man, after he praised the city of Naples.\n\nThey are priced at 3/1 with the bookies, while Valencia and Bologna are both at 6/1.", "description": "The forward's time in the MLS looks to be at an end with Atletico Madrid favourites to be his next destination", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images", "Sipa Usa Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20749655.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Los-Angeles-Galaxy-v-Los-Angeles-FC-Western-Conference-Semifinals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
