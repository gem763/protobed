After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\nSuper sleuth: On Wednesday morning the mother of four posted on Twitter and Instagram, admitting she has been planting false Instagram stories on her private page\n\n'To try and prove this, I came up with an idea, I blocked everyone from viewing Instagram except ONE account. '\n\nShe continued: '(Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven't had stories on there for a while). Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper.\n\n'And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flood in my new house.\n\n'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it's come from.\n\nWar of words: After Coleen shared her allegations against Rebekah on Wednesday, her fellow WAG, who is currently on holiday with Jamie in Dubai, hit back minutes later\n\n'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nShe also wrote: 'This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it......'\n\nAfter Coleen shared her allegations against Rebekah on Wednesday, her fellow WAG, who is currently on holiday with Jamie in Dubai, hit back minutes later on social media and denied the accusations.\n\nShe wrote: 'Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even having to write this. I\u2019m pregnant & on holiday & am at a loss to why she would do this.\n\n'I\u2019m now having to take legal advice as I can\u2019t deal with this stress myself when I\u2019m this pregnant.\n\nDisgusted: Rebekah (left) has denied Coleen's accusations that she has been selling stories on her (the pair pictured at the England vs Wales match in France in 2016)\n\nShe also shared: 'As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n'I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n'If you thought this was happening you can could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.'\n\nShe continued: 'Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself.\n\n'I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\n'I liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n'I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened [broken heart emoji].'", "description": "Coleen Rooney may have a Manchester based poker player to thank after she turned super sleuth to investigate who has been leaking private stories about her family to the press.", "authors": ["Joanna Crawley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19497534-0-image-a-4_1570633717266.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
