Meanwhile, almost a quarter look for deals and discounts, and many cut down their food and drink costs by eating and drinking before they go out.\n\nBut there have been numerous signs that Britain's night time economy is struggling. According to research from property firm Altus Group, nearly around 12,000 UK pubs shut between 2010 and 2018, although the rate of closure is slowing.\n\nMeanwhile, once-popular restaurant chains such as Jamie's Italian and Byron Burger have had to announce closures after struggling to pay their rents. Live music venues have been hit too.\n\nPeter Marks, chief executive of Deltic, said: \"This quarter's Deltic Night Index demonstrates that consumers are spending a significant portion of their disposable income on going out.\n\n\"However, these aren't impulse purchases. People are clearly thinking about where and when they spend their money, as shown by the percentage of people that budget, and seek out the best value whilst enjoying a fantastic night out.\"", "description": "The average Briton is spending \u00a370.69 on a night out, up 25% since last year, a survey finds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E9F3/production/_109019895_djandcrowdshots07.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
