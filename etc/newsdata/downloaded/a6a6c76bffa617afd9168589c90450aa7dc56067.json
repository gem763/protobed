The Wisconsin-based company is the largest independent spice retailer in the country, and its stores are deliberately simple \u2014 humble wood boxes stacked on the floor replace de rigueur minimalist design \u2014 but packed with proprietary spice mixes with names like \u201cJustice.\u201d Now, owner Bill Penzey is looking to dispense a different kind of justice.\n\nOn Wednesday, Axios published data showing which groups are spending the most money on impeachment ads on Facebook. President Donald Trump \u2014 who recently said through a White House lawyer that he will not comply with the current impeachment inquiry against him \u2014 spent about $718,000 in a recent week (September 29th to October 5th), which is $626K more than the second place spender. But the next biggest buyer is not a political organization, a politician or a nonprofit; it\u2019s Penzeys Spices.\n\nTo be clear, while Trump is of course buying anti-impeachment ads, Penzeys is buying space to advocate for impeachment \u2014 to the tune of $92K during the same seven-day period. Coming in thousands of dollars less are people like Democratic presidential hopeful Tom Steyer and Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, and groups like the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nWhy is Penzeys, of all companies, spending so much on impeachment? Vox recently looked into the issue:\n\n\u201cThe pro-impeachment posts have worked better than any ads the company has placed before, founder Bill Penzey told Fox Business, despite Facebook labeling the ad as political content.\u201d\n\nYou may have heard of Bill before in connection to Trump. A week after the 2016 election, Penzey penned a newsletter to customers decrying the \u201copen embrace of racism by the Republican Party\u201d \u2014 and it went viral. While that naturally attracted criticism, as Vox notes, \u201conline sales rose nearly 60 percent within two weeks\u201d of the newsletter.\n\nHowever, the impeachment ads Penzeys is promoting probably aren\u2019t what you expect. Unlike those of Trump which feature demonstratably false conspiracy theories and those of the Russian trolls, they\u2019re actually quite wholesome: a letter from Penzey, his personal email and a photo of a red, white and blue tie-dye heart.\n\nBecause somebody needs to say this:It\u2019s the end of the Republican Party as we know it\u2014And we should all feel fine\u2026 Posted by Penzeys Spices on Thursday, October 3, 2019\n\nOver 1,500 words and only two in all caps?
