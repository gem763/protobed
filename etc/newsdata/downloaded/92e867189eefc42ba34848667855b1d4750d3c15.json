If you purchase the stock on or after the 25th of October, you won't be eligible to receive this dividend, when it is paid on the 31st of October.\n\nWallenstam's next dividend payment will be kr0.9 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of kr1.9 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Wallenstam has a trailing yield of 1.7% on the current share price of SEK114.2. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Wallenstam\n\nDividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Wallenstam paying out a modest 27% of its earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Fortunately, it paid out only 45% of its free cash flow in the past year.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nOM:WALL B Historical Dividend Yield, October 21st 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see Wallenstam's earnings per share have risen 13% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Wallenstam has delivered 14% dividend growth per year on average over the past ten years. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Wallenstam? We love that Wallenstam is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about Wallenstam, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.\n\nEver wonder what the future holds for Wallenstam?
