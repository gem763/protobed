Sometimes I still do.\n\nFor any young Muslim like myself, whether they be queer, an ally or have a passion for social justice similar to mine, this kind of struggle to find like-minded people is all too real.\n\nThis craving to find other Muslims who are open-minded enough to not just accept who they are but completely embrace their identities and to see these same people speak out against issues of marginalisation like racism, sexism and Islamophobia has always been validating to me. They were my fearless Muslim heroes and I had hoped they would speak out against homophobia in much the same way, particularly during the marriage equality debate in 2017. At the time, they never did. But attitudes are changing now and queer Muslims and allies around the world are having a moment which needs to be acknowledged.\n\n'Years in the making': the story behind Sydney\u2019s successful WorldPride 2023 bid Read more\n\nIn its winning bid to host the 2023 WorldPride, which will be themed \u201cfearless\u201d, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras emphasised the importance of the event to \u201cshine a light on the widespread human rights abuses by our regional neighbours\u201d. In the bid, there was special mention of certain Muslim-majority nations, such as Brunei, to contrast with Australia\u2019s more progressive treatment of LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nEven though much of the Muslim world still hasn\u2019t decriminalised homosexuality nor granted marriage equality like Australia has, in recent years there has been a noticeable shift in attitude with respect to sexuality among Muslim populations and an increased visibility of queer Muslims in the media.\n\nThis change is very significant.\n\nPride festivals do not exist to simply celebrate handsome, 6-foot white boys with glittered abs \u2013 the community has always been much more diverse\n\nIn 2016, prominent queer activist, Xulhaz Mannan, founder of Bangladesh\u2019s only LGBTQ+ magazine, Roopbaan, and the country\u2019s first \u201crainbow rally\u201d, was hacked to death in his flat. He was not the only person to have been killed in the Muslim world for standing up for gay rights. But the Muslim population has come a long way in its efforts to accept the queer community since then. Two years later, neighbouring India, which is home to about 200 million Muslims, decriminalised homosexuality with the repeal of the colonial-era law, section 377.\n\nToday, many Muslims are proudly flaunting their queerness. Whether it be UK charity, Imaan, raising more than \u00a38,000 (A$15,000) to hold the first ever pride festival specifically for LGBTQ+ Muslims in London in 2020 or images of US congresswoman Ilhan Omar dancing at pride being circulated on Twitter, it is clear that sections of the Muslim community are not holding back from literally parading their support for LGBTQ+ folk. This change is substantial.\n\nEven conversations in the media relating to Muslims and their sexual identity are becoming more commonplace. Any discussion of sex or sexual orientation has historically been taboo in our communities. However, today Sayeeda Warsi\u2019s weekly Muslim Pride BBC4 Radio podcast explores how Islam and same-sex attraction are not mutually exclusive, by providing a wide platform for queer Muslims to share their experiences. The way that Tan France from Netflix\u2019s Queer Eye or Omar from Spanish drama Elite, shine the light on LGBTQ+ Muslims; their struggles and stories epitomise how the idea of queer Muslims is slowly becoming more mainstream nowadays. This kind of representation was essentially non-existent only a few years back.\n\nSomeone who has contributed to the increased visibility of queer Muslims and knows the struggle all too well is British singer-songwriter Leo Kalyan. He said: \u201cMuslims are a demonised people. And for me, I feel like as a gay person, I\u2019m on the outside of the outside of the outside because I\u2019m demonised by Muslims as well.\u201d The inevitable backlash from certain Muslim communities against queer Muslims is exactly why this visibility is so necessary and why any kind of progress should be celebrated at pride.\n\nEarlier this year American activist Blair Imani eloquently laid bare why being a follower of the Islamic faith and being proudly queer are not mutually exclusive. She says: \u201c[Allah] (God) made me to be a queer Muslim because Allah makes no mistakes.\u201d Although the last part of Imani\u2019s statement is reminiscent of Lady Gaga\u2019s song Born This Way, to hear this kind of proud declaration from Muslims in the media was practically unheard of until recently.\n\nIf we are to expect future generations of queer Muslim children to feel any kind of pride in their identity, we need to be celebrating individuals like Kalyan and Imani who are becoming role models for this community. We need to be celebrating this progress at WorldPride.\n\nI\u2019m gay, married, and not leaving my church | Joel Hollier Read more\n\nMany Muslim-majority countries have still not progressed to the stage as Australia in terms of their treatment of LGBTQ+ issues. Nonetheless, Muslim communities around the world are evolving and conversations about these issues are being initiated like never before. Attitudes are changing and queer Muslim visibility is at its peak.\n\nJust over three years ago, 25 people marched down Oxford Street at the Sydney Mardi Gras for the first time holding up a banner which read \u201cMuslims Against Homophobia\u201d. Since then, so much has changed in the way many Muslim people treat LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nPride festivals do not exist to simply celebrate handsome, 6-foot white boys with glittered abs \u2013 the community has always been much larger and more diverse than those who are the most visible. Diversity (of identity and experience) has always been at the centre of such events, and I hope WorldPride is reflective of the milestones Muslim communities have reached as well.\n\nProgressive Muslims, queer and allies alike, certainly have much to be proud of in terms of what has been achieved over the past few years.\n\nThis community embodies what it means to be truly fearless.\n\n\u2022 Masrur Joarder is a university student and writer\n\n\u2022 Comments on this piece will be pre-moderated", "description": "I hope Sydney WorldPride will reflect the milestones these communities have reached around the world", "authors": ["Masrur Joarder"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4524fa0e5bdcb1005dc682b79a6e0660a4648220/0_355_5478_3287/master/5478.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=648276c977dffcbaeae84e53ed4ec447", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
