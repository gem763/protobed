These embryo-like structures will also be useful for drug and toxicity screens to prevent pregnancy failure and birth defects,\u201d Mr. Fu said, adding that the team created them in controllable, reproducible and scalable ways.\n\nThe researchers made 12 to 15 embryo-like structures simultaneously at a 95% success rate, he said. Mr. Fu estimates that since 2016 the team has produced a few hundred embryo-like parts, keeping them less than four days.\n\nThe research has raised some ethical concerns about the idea of \u201csynthetic\u201d or \u201cartificial\u201d embryos, and Mr. Fu said he understands why some people might feel uncomfortable with the concept.\n\n\u201cWe are well aware of the sensitivity of our research,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he stressed that what he and the team have created are a mass of cells that mimic portions of a developing embryo that cannot develop into a fetus. He said the research team has no intention of creating a \u201csynthetic embryo\u201d and has \u201cno scientific reason\u201d to do so.\n\nJosephine Johnston, director of research and research scholar at the Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute, said the team\u2019s study could raise the question of whether the embryo-like structures can be manipulated to create a fetus or whether these scientific techniques are bringing society closer to creating embryos from stem cells, which she described as likely implausible but understandable concerns for the public.\n\nMs. Johnston also questioned if the word \u201cembryo\u201d is the correct terminology for Mr. Fu\u2019s team\u2019s work if the structures cannot develop in the womb, cautioning about language use to describe scientific models.\n\nShe said the stem cell work, along with cloning research and in vitro fertilization, raise similar concerns about the prospect of embryos having no family structure, and growing them inside people\u2019s bodies and the manipulation of human life. Ms. Johnston added that religious concerns also play a role, which is why there is opposition to in vitro fertilization.\n\n\u201cAnytime you are modeling human biology, you are only creating a model. So it\u2019s never quite the same, and it can\u2019t necessarily answer all the same questions,\u201d she said of Mr. Fu\u2019s team\u2019s study and the growth of cultured cells in a dish. \u201cBut it is often a really important intermediary step before moving into doing experiments with humans.\u201d\n\nThe Fu team\u2019s work is the first demonstration of a bona fide human embryo-like structure and shows that such structures can be made from pluripotent or induced pluripotent stem cells in vitro, according to Anna-Katerina Hadjantonakis, a developmental biologist for the Sloan Kettering Institute.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important is that this method is very robust and reproducible. Many identical structures can be generated at once, all having similar morphology which approximates to the human embryo,\u201d she said. \u201cThe work opens the door and provides an accessible method for future studies in other laboratories.\u201d\n\nMr. Fu said he and the team are interested in continuing to \u201cpolish\u201d the stem cell in vitro system using fluid-controlling devices to prolong the culture of human embryo-like structures.\n\nHe said other scientists have been able to create structures that resemble complete mouse embryos and implant those synthetic embryos into a surrogate. However, there has been no further development of artificial animal embryos beyond early implantation, he said.\n\nMr. Fu said he and his group created a 3D culture system using human stem cells two years ago. Other scientists have reported building 3D systems using mouse and human stem cells.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
