An atomic clock keeps the most accurate time on the planet essentially by measuring the high-speed vibrations of atoms.\n\nThe other part, considered the mobile unit, is a mechanical wristwatch, which can be docked in the base unit to correct any discrepancies in the time-keeping, as well as \"compensating for any minute changes in temperature, air pressure or humidity,\" according to Urwerk.", "description": "The Urwerk AMC is one of the most complicated and precise timekeeping devices ever built. \"It keeps accuracy to one second every 317 years,\" Paul Boutros head of watches for Phillips, where the AMC will be sold at the \"Game Changers\" auction, tells CNBC.", "authors": ["Erica Wright"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106195890-1571754992105amc_3.jpg?v=1571843831", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
