These are the first two closures caused by Hurricane Dorian, and are indicated red on the Waffle House Index.\n\nWarner said 10 additional resturants in the Charleston area are still open, but operating without power. They're using the limited no-power menu, and are tagged yellow by the index. In total, Waffle House has about 25 restaurants in the Charleston area. The remaining ones are operating at full capacity and are coded green.\n\nAs for when the restaurants will reopen, Warner says that depends on three variables.\n\n\"That's a decision we make on the ground,\" Warner said. \"Do we have the people, do we have the utilities, and what is the food situation.\"\n\nDorian on Wednesday weakened to a Category 2 storm, but regained strength and was a Category 3 storm as it hovered off the South Carolina coast on Thursday.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warns Dorian's eye is just off the coast and could potentially make landfall before \"brushing past Cape Hatteras.\"\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officials keep a close eye on the Waffle House Index, which was started with Hurricane Charley during the 2004 season and assigns color codes to measure the state of areas impacted by a storm.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cWaffle House became almost like a rough guidepost,\u201d former FEMA director Craig Fugate, the creator of the index, told FOX Business. \u201cIf it was open and had a full menu we probably weren\u2019t in the worst-hit areas yet.\u201d", "description": "Waffle House just closed its first two restaurants due to Hurricane Dorian.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/dorian-waffle-house-AP-getty-02.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
