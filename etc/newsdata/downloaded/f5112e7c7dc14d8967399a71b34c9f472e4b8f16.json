The drop is not disastrous (it was down 14% two summers ago ), but it does burden a domestic box office that is already down 6% overall.\n\nThat's not to say there weren't any bright spots. \" Spider-Man: Far From Home \" was the first film in the series to make more than $1 billion worldwide. \"John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum\" and Quentin Tarantino's \" Once Upon a Time In Hollywood , two R-rated films, both found an audience. But this summer's slate of films mostly didn't \"live up to the hype,\" according to Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at\n\n\"Brands still matter, but you have to have content that delivers and offers the moviegoer an exciting in-theater experience,\" Dergarabedian told CNN Business. \"Short of that, audiences today have way too many options to settle for just an OK experience.\"\n\nThe summer was especially harsh for sequels like \" Men In Black: International \" and \" Dark Phoenix ,\" both of which failed to meet industry expectations. \"Dark Phoenix,\" made only $252 million globally, which makes it the lowest-grossing film in the otherwise lucrative X-Men franchise.\n\nIf it was a rough summer for sequels, it was even worse for comedies.\n\nUniversal's \" Good Boys \" and \"Yesterday\" are the only comedies in the top twenty highest-grossing films of the summer. Other such as \"Long Shot,\" \"Stuber\" and \"Late Night\" fell short at the box office.\n\n\"Movies are like coffee, they're better when they're fresh,\" Dergarabedian said. \"Many of this summer's sequels and comedies seemed derivative and lacked a fresh perspective. That was met with indifference from audiences.\"\n\nThe summer of Disney\n\nDisney DIS The summer may have been lackluster for just about everyone else in Hollywood, but it wasn't for, which produced three of the top five highest-grossing films of the summer.\n\n\"The Lion King\" and \"Toy Story 4\" are at No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. The live action remake of \"Aladdin\" came in at No. 4.\n\nDisney also hit two major box office milestones this summer.\n\n\"No studio in the industry knows their audience better than Disney right now,\" Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Boxoffice.com , told CNN Business. \"This summer, and 2019 as a whole, long looked to be their capstone movie slate after years of major franchise acquisitions and top tier brand development.\"\n\nBut wait, there's more\n\nHollywood still has plenty to look forward to for the rest of 2019.\n\nHighly-anticipated films such as \"It: Chapter Two,\" \"Joker,\" \"Jumanji: The Next Level,\" \"Frozen 2,\" \"Cats\" and the final chapter of the Skywalker saga, \" Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker \" are all scheduled to hit theaters before the end of the year.\n\nThey could give the 2019 box office a much-needed boost, and maybe even lead to a record year, according to Dergarabedian.\n\n\"We hit a record last year when the domestic box office brought in roughly $11.9 billion,\" he said. \"If everything clicks from here on out, this year could be bigger. But it'll be close.\"", "description": "The summer movie season has done little to help ease a bumpy year at the box office.", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190716005245-the-lion-king-zazu-simba-super-tease.jpg"}
