Keith Wildhaber.\n\nWildhaber testified that he was told to \"tone down his gayness\" to secure a promotion to lieutenant. Wildhaber was passed over 23 times for promotion. He said he also was transferred from the Affton precinct against his wishes after filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nThe jury awarded Wildhaber $1.9 million in actual damages and $10 million in punitive damages on the discrimination claim. It added $999,000 in actual damages and $7 million in punitive damages for the retaliation claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
