Three women talk about the devastating effect it had \u2013 and still has \u2013 on them\n\nRuth King (not her real name) can still remember the call coming through on her mobile. She thinks of that moment as \u201cthe start of hell\u201d. \u201cIt was four years ago, but I remember it clear as day,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was my friend warning that there were videos of me everywhere. Her husband worked at a local factory and pornographic videos of me were being shared between all the workers.\u201d\n\nKing\u2019s instant response was to vomit. \u201cI was working with my dad \u2013 he\u2019s an old-fashioned type of guy, so what could I say? I told him I wasn\u2019t well and went home.\u201d Almost as soon as she got there, another friend, a builder, called to tell her the same videos were being passed around his building site. \u201cHe said: \u2018I didn\u2019t believe they were of you, Ruth, but I looked and they are.\u2019\u201d\n\nSeven videos had been posted on porn sites by King\u2019s ex-partner. When she looked online, they had been shared tens of thousands of times. \u201cThe comments underneath were disgusting \u2013 men describing what they\u2019d do to me,\u201d says King, who is now in her late 30s and a mother. \u201cI live in a rural area where everyone knows everyone and my life has never been the same since. It\u2019s torture for the soul.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s recent decision to review the laws surrounding so-called \u201crevenge porn\u201d is acknowledgment that the current provision is no match for this ever-evolving crime. Campaigners have flagged up an alarming list of shortfalls. It is still not even categorised as a \u201csexual offence\u201d \u2013 although to victims, it can feel every bit as violating. Sentences are light and prosecutions rare, requiring proof of \u201cdirect intention to cause distress\u201d (which means perpetrators who claim they posted the images for a laugh are off the hook). Fake Photoshopped porn isn\u2019t covered at all \u2013 no matter how convincing.\n\nThe UK\u2019s sole specialist support is the Revenge Porn Helpline, which has a staff of three (only one of whom is full-time). It takes calls from victims in extreme distress, who are often suicidal, and works flat out to remove content before it spreads across multiple platforms.\n\nAlthough the number of revenge porn cases reported to the police has more than doubled since 2015, experts believe it is impossible to estimate their true scale since most victims do not seek help. One nationwide study in New Zealand suggested 5% of adults have experienced it; another in the US put the figure at almost 13%. Calls to the Revenge Porn Helpline indicate that 70% of victims in the UK are women.\n\nClare McGlynn, professor of law at Durham University, believes the whole area is underestimated and poorly understood. She points out that the very term revenge porn is inaccurate, failing to highlight the range of motives behind it, and painfully insensitive to victims. (\u201cRevenge\u201d implies the perpetrators have been somehow wronged \u2013 and should the victim\u2019s images be labelled \u201cporn\u201d without consent?)\n\nMcGlynn worked on the most comprehensive study to date of the impact that image-based sexual abuse has on victims \u2013 Shattering Lives and Myths was launched in parliament in July.\n\n\u201cWhat really came across was the social rupture \u2013 how it divides lives into \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cSome women lost jobs, relationships. They were isolated from family, friends, they withdrew entirely from the online world. And that was constant, an almost daily threat hanging over them. They\u2019re always rediscovering it, or waiting for it to be redistributed. They see no time when the abuse will be over.\u201d\n\nKing ironically refers to it as \u201cthe gift that keeps on giving\u201d. The videos of her had been created when she had separated from her husband and become involved with an abusive man for nine months. This is something else that comes through in the Shattering Lives report. These images are often taken against a backdrop of coercion and the threat of distributing them is a means of control. Half the women in the report believed this was their partner\u2019s primary motive.\n\n\u201cHe swept me off my feet,\u201d says King. \u201cAt the beginning, I was besotted and that\u2019s when he asked for videos, telling me exactly what he wanted me to do. I can, hand on heart, say it\u2019s not something I\u2019d have even thought to do on my own.\u201d\n\nThe relationship soured fast. The man was controlling and then violent, once strangling King to the point of her passing out. One evening, the couple were watching TV when he plugged in a memory stick and videos appeared on the screen. \u201cHe was quietly showing me how much damage he could do if I left him,\u201d says King. \u201cBut I still had to get out. My life was in danger.\u201d When she ended the relationship and reunited with her husband, the texts started \u2013 more than 100 a day threatening to share the videos. Finally, he did.\n\n\u201cFirst, my survival instinct kicked in,\u201d says King. \u201cI called the police who told me they couldn\u2019t prove it was him because the videos had been shared hundreds of thousands of times. The Revenge Porn Helpline helped me remove videos \u2013 and each time I\u2019d feel elated \u2013 but within a day, they\u2019d be back, posted with a different title. \u201cI changed my whole look,\u201d she says. \u201cI isolated myself, and stopped going out almost completely. I couldn\u2019t even collect the children from school. My husband did everything. He\u2019s quite high up in a local business and his staff all saw the videos, too.\n\n\u201cEveryone saw them,\u201d she continues. \u201cTwo years after the first post, an older man I\u2019d known my whole life came up to me and told me he\u2019d like to see what I was like in real life. I couldn\u2019t speak. I was like a frightened rabbit. It\u2019s continual \u2013 not one incident like an assault that finishes, so you can try to recover.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, King says, it all became too much. She tried to kill herself and ended up in hospital. \u201cIt feels really selfish now, but I couldn\u2019t cope. There\u2019s no end and no escape because the web is worldwide. You feel so, so exposed.\u201d\n\nMikala Monsoon, 23, a makeup artist from Glasgow, understands this all too well. She describes the feeling as \u201clike one of those dreams when you\u2019re naked in a glass chamber\u201d.\n\nMonsoon was 17 when she sent the pictures that are still resurfacing six years on. \u201cI was at a very low point in my life, flirting with a couple of people on Tinder,\u201d she says. She doesn\u2019t know who posted the images, but about a year later, a friend messaged to say: \u2018This is embarrassing, but I felt I should tell you I found this.\u2019 The attached link took Monsoon to a porn site displaying a picture of her alongside her full name. She had it taken down, but every few months, someone would contact her to say they had found it again.\n\n\u201cIt was mortifying,\u201d she says. \u201cEach time, I\u2019d spend a month obsessively Googling my name several times a day, finding stuff. I was really wary of people looking at me or talking to me and still am. I was in a cafe yesterday and these men were staring the whole time. Was it because they\u2019d seen the picture?\n\n\u201cIt never goes away. What if I applied for a job and my employers Googled my name? Or if I wanted a future in the public eye? Would everything link back to it for ever?\u201d While King changed her appearance, Monsoon changed her name and moved cities.\n\nBut this year Monsoon decided to go public. Someone had found the picture on a file-sharing site that contained hundreds of folders and thousands of explicit images \u2013 Monsoon was in the \u201cGlasgow Girls\u201d folder and there were folders for cities across the UK. \u201cThis time, I got really angry. I was sick of it,\u201d says Monsoon. She wrote an Instagram post about it and was inundated by messages from other women who had experienced the same thing. She set up a website revengeonrevengeporn.com and started a petition to force companies to ensure consent before uploading explicit content.\n\n\u201cI used to keep very quiet about it, but now I\u2019m a bit more empowered,\u201d says Monsoon. \u201cI refuse to be ashamed. People think it\u2019s OK to say: \u2018You shouldn\u2019t have taken the pictures.\u2019 Would you tell a rape victim she shouldn\u2019t have worn a short skirt?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a relationship now and if my partner and I are apart and I want to send him a picture, I\u2019ll do it. Telling women not to take a photo isn\u2019t the answer,\u201d she says. \u201cSome women are coerced into it. Others have their pictures taken when they\u2019re asleep or in the shower, without their knowledge. You can end up on deep fake stuff that everyone believes is real. You just need to exist to become a victim.\u201d\n\nFolami Prehaye, 49, an HR/quality audit manager from Bristol and a mother of two adult children, is another victim who firmly rejects shame and blame. \u201cA lot of people have said: \u2018Why did you take the photographs?\u2019 but, at the end of the day, that ain\u2019t the crime,\u201d she says.\n\nIn 2012, Prehaye\u2019s pictures were posted by an ex-partner on to multiple porn sites as well as a fake Facebook account in her name \u2013 with friend requests sent to all her friends. She went straight to the police \u2013 and although Monsoon and King found them unhelpful, Prehaye\u2019s experience was more positive.\n\n\u201cI had to sit opposite this officer while he clicked on every link,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought: \u2018Folami, you know what? You\u2019ve had two children. It\u2019s a means to an end. Just deal with it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t always easy, of course. Her colleagues saw the pictures and she was sent on \u201cgardening leave\u201d. (She has since changed jobs.) \u201cThere were times I wouldn\u2019t go out and I couldn\u2019t eat; I stayed at home hooded up.\u201d\n\nHer ex was charged and received a six-month suspended sentence. Since this abuse is not categorised as a sex crime, Prehaye had no automatic anonymity (something she and other campaigners are trying to change) and a local paper reported the details, including her name. \u201cThen another journalist requested a full interview and I asked my children what they thought. They said: \u2018Mum, you\u2019ve got an opportunity here \u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to run and hide and be sitting on a beach at 70 only to be told that someone has found a photo of me again,\u201d says Prehaye. \u201cI couldn\u2019t live like that. Speaking out was about taking back control.\u201d\n\nPrehaye gave the interview, then set up a website, voic.org.uk (Victims of Internet Crime). She is regularly contacted by victims from across the world. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s part of the healing,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people go to counsellors, but I didn\u2019t. If I help one person by sharing my story, then that helps me too.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaking on a public persona can be hugely empowering,\u201d says McGlynn, \u201cbut that\u2019s only ever going to be an option for a very small number.\u201d For most victims, the impact of speaking out on their children, partner and careers would be too great.\n\nSophie Mortimer, the manager of the Revenge Porn Helpline, says what helps victims most is swift removal of images and access to justice. \u201cIt makes a huge difference when the police take it seriously, the case is prosecuted and society acknowledges what happened is very wrong, instead of blaming you,\u201d she says.\n\nKing was helped by two years of therapy and the support of her husband. \u201cWithout him, I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has caused him so much trouble and he has never once used it against me.\u201d She also found support in surprising places. \u201cOne woman I barely knew crossed the road to speak to me. She said that what happened to me was awful and how sorry she was. Things like that really helped.\u201d\n\nKing plans to tell her daughter the full story when she starts secondary school. Until then, she is staying anonymous. \u201cSome days are better than others,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress, but manageable.\u201d King does the school run now, and is able to walk past groups of men without giving into the urge to run away.\n\nMost importantly, she hasn\u2019t searched for the videos in more than a year. \u201cThey\u2019re still out there and if I looked, I\u2019d find them,\u201d she says. \u201cFor your own survival, at some point, you have to stop.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The Revenge Porn Helpline can be reached on 0345 6000 459.
