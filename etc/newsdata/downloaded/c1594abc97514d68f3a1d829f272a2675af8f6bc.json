Ron DeSantis, who has been attempting to install his own allies in the state party. A senior Republican Party official on Tuesday confirmed Wiles\u2019 departure, which followed weeks of behind-the-scenes drama that has prompted turnover at the highest levels of the state GOP apparatus.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDeSantis personally made it clear he wanted Wiles out, according to two senior Republicans familiar with discussions between DeSantis and the Trump campaign.\n\nNews of the Wiles ouster had not filtered down to Republican Party of Florida chairman Joe Gruters as of early Tuesday.\n\nEarly in the day, the state senator called Wiles a \u201csuperstar\u201d and said he expected her to be an \u201cintegral part of the team.\u201d Despite news that she was leaving her lobbying job, Gruters said he expected her to reprise her role as co-chair for the Florida campaign.\n\n\u201cObviously I am not in the know\u201d Gruters said later Tuesday. \u201cShe played a critical role in 2016, obviously she\u2019s going to be missed.\u201d\n\nWiles\u2019 departure is widely seen as a setback to the president\u2019s re-election campaign, which could live or die on the outcome in Florida.\n\nFlorida Politics today reported that Wiles had left her lobbying firm, Ballard Partners, due to health reasons.\n\nWiles, a longtime Florida political hand who played a key role in Trump's 2016 campaign, has been at the center of a power struggle that pitted her against key members of DeSantis' inner circle \u2014 chief of staff Shane Strum and his wife, Casey DeSantis.\n\nAfter meeting with Republican Party of Florida officials in April, Strum and Casey DeSantis concluded that the state party was stocked with Wiles allies. They moved to bring in people who would focus on the governor\u2019s accomplishments, not solely on the president\u2019s re-election.\n\nIn April, Casey DeSantis and Strum asked Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale to replace state party Executive Director Jennifer Locetta.\n\nLast month, former acting Veterans Affairs Secretary Peter O\u2019Rourke replaced Locetta, a Wiles ally.\n\nWiles attributed her departure from the campaign, and from her Florida-based lobbying shop, to health issues.\n\n\u201cDue to a nagging health issue, it\u2019s time for me to focus on taking care of myself, so out of fairness to the firm and its clients, I have decided to separate from Ballard Partners,\u201d Wiles said in a statement to Florida Politics. \u201cThough I strongly support the president\u2019s re-election, I will also not be active with the Trump campaign in an official position.\u201d\n\nGary Fineout contributed to this report.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this report misstated which position Brad Parscale was asked to replace. Shane Strum and Casey DeSantis asked Parscale for a new state party executive director.", "description": "Gov.
