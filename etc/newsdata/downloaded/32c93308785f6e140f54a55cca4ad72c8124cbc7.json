Both teams are trying to avoid 0-2 starts in conference play. The Razorbacks have lost their last 12 SEC games, and 16 of 17.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nArkansas QB Nick Starkel vs. his former team. The grad transfer from Texas A&M; has back-to-back 300-yard passing games with three TDs in each game since taking over as the Razorbacks starter. But he did have five interceptions in last week\u2019s 31-24 loss to San Jose State, which was a 20-point underdog that hadn\u2019t been a major conference team since 2006. While coach Jimbo Fisher said Starkel was a \u201cvery good player\u201d with the Aggies, junior Kellen Mond is 16-9 as their starter.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nTexas A&M;: Junior WR Jhamon Austin has consecutive 100-yard receiving games, with 111 yards against Auburn after 109 against Lamar. He missed four games last season because of injury after 12 catches for 112 yards in the 2017 Belk Bowl against Wake Forest. The Aggies had only four 100-yard receiving games last season.\n\nArkansas: Junior RB Rakeem Boyd has 394 yards rushing and three TDs. He didn\u2019t play as a freshman at Texas A&M; in 2016 before going to Independence Community College and then was the Razorbacks\u2019 leading rusher last season.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nThis will be the sixth consecutive meeting at the home stadium of the NFL\u2019s Dallas Cowboys, whose owner Jerry Jones was co-captain of Arkansas\u2019 undefeated 1964 team. \u2026 The Aggies won 24-17 last year, after three of the previous four games in the series went to overtime. \u2026 The Razorbacks have eight turnovers (six interceptions, two fumbles) this season.
