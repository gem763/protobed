It is also a way to directly encroach on Labour\u2019s turf should there be an election. He began conference claiming 40 new hospitals would be built in the next 10 years and ended the four-day event by dedicating a sizeable chunk of his speech to the NHS. He described it as \u201choly to the people of this country\u201d and got cheers from the conference floor when he said: \u201cIt is time for us to say loud and clear we are the party of the NHS.\u201d\n\nHis play to become the face of Tory investment in health, despite Theresa May being responsible for the increase in funding, is wrapped up in his renewed push to present himself as a one nation Conservative. Meanwhile, the party chairman, James Cleverly, twice infuriated Labour politicians when he claimed at fringe events that it was in fact the Tories who founded the NHS, via the efforts of Sir Henry Willnick, a Tory MP who made suggestions for a form of nationalised health service in 1944.\n\nTories are talking tough on law and order\n\nThe home secretary, Priti Patel, delivered the most hardline and rightwing of all the speeches during conference as she careered through pledges on tougher jail sentences for sex offenders, more Tasers for officers, stamping out \u201cevil\u201d county lines drug gangs with a fresh \u00a320m investment and pausing for dramatic effect with her warning to criminals: \u201cWe are coming after you.\u201d The biggest applause was reserved for her pledge to end free movement once and for all and repeating the pre-announced introduction of an Australian-style immigration system. She also appeared to be enjoying her much seized-upon line: \u201cThis daughter of immigrants needs no lectures from the north London liberal elite.\u201d This felt odd considering the prime minister, Boris Johnson, lived in Islington until a few years ago and his strategist Dominic Cummings is still a resident.\n\nMinisters have no clue of their own government\u2019s Brexit plan\n\nThe secrecy around the prime minister\u2019s Brexit plan was painfully clear when even his cabinet ministers were unable to field questions on the subject in a series of awkward interviews. The security minister and former party chairman Brandon Lewis was ripped apart by BBC Newsnight\u2019s Emily Maitlis for not being able to give details on Johnson\u2019s final offer to the EU, or explain how the government might deliver Brexit on 31 October. The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, was uncharacteristically coy on Channel 4 News on Tuesday when asked about Johnson\u2019s Brexit offer to the EU, saying: \u201cI am yet to hear the final details.\u201d\n\nThe international trade secretary, Liz Truss, made the shrewdest move when asked about how the government could get around the Benn Act, the legislation that blocks a no-deal Brexit. She said she was sure the prime minister, Rees-Mogg and Michael Gove, the cabinet minister for no-deal planning, had \u201cgot it covered\u201d.\n\nResurgence of the Democratic Unionist party\n\nThe DUP was once again the centre of attention and its conference event, a reception entitled Together for the United Kingdom, was the hottest ticket in town on Tuesday night. The lively event had all the hubris of the DUP\u2019s 2017 Tory conference party event, held just months after it signed the confidence and supply agreement to prop up Theresa May\u2019s government. Its sudden announcement that it backed the prime minister\u2019s final offer to the EU on replacing the backstop set tongues wagging.\n\nAfter heavily resisting any alignment with the EU on customs, the DUP now appears willing to accept Johnson\u2019s complex-sounding border solution that would keep Northern Ireland tied to Brussels regulation until 2025. The leader, Arlene Foster, said it was time to get a deal done, prompting speculation that it is the DUP\u2019s own fear of a potential Jeremy Corbyn government that has secured fresh cooperation with the Tories.\n\nOne nation vs free-market Thatcherism\n\nJohnson made great efforts to present himself as a softer, kinder, one nation Tory throughout the conference. We were to frame his hardline Brexit stance as an aberration to get Brexit done, he suggested. He even told the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson that he was still the same \u201cgenerous-hearted, loving, caring\u201d person he had been when he was mayor of London.\n\nHowever, the Brexit-backing, free-market Thatcherite wing was heavily in attendance at this year\u2019s conference with scores of younger members \u2013 mostly besuited and with heavy use of Instagram and Twitter \u2013 a noticeable presence at fringe events and parties. The Institute for Economic Affairs events were packed and standing room only, while the IEA\u2019s joint party with the Taxpayers Alliance was a giddy affair with guests including Rees-Mogg and the pro-Brexit former minister Penny Mordaunt. The free-marketeer Truss was stopped for selfies everywhere she went.", "description": "Boris Johnson makes a play for the NHS but confusion reigns over Brexit plan", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9abbf5ec2ea128a4cf852833c2ed0ccfef046351/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=37751a95a90feaa9238a1328ec931953"}
