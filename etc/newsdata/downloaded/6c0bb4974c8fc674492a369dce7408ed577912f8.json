Does that mean we\u2019ll never hear new music from her?", "language": "en", "text": "Rapper Nicki Minaj joined a long and varied list of musicians Thursday when she announced her retirement from music.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to retire,\u201d she tweeted, and \u201chave my family.\u201d\n\nMany read the tweet as Minaj \u2014 who revealed in June that she and partner Kenneth Petty have a marriage license \u2014 declaring she is officially leaving the rap game to start a family. (A representative for Minaj did not immediately return The Washington Post\u2019s inquiry.) Some eagle-eyed fans noted when she changed her Twitter name from Ms. Minaj to Mrs. Petty over the summer.\n\nI\u2019ve decided to retire & have my family. I know you guys are happy now. To my fans, keep reppin me, do it til da death of me, \u274c in the box- cuz ain\u2019t nobody checkin me. \u2705 Love you for LIFE \ud83d\ude18\u2665\ufe0f\ud83e\udd84 \u2014 Mrs. Petty (@NICKIMINAJ) September 5, 2019\n\nOthers were more skeptical of the news.\n\nRappers rarely retire, they just say they\u2019re retiring for attention and then drop a comeback album. \u2014 Luke James (@lukejamesbgn) September 5, 2019\n\nJeezy said he retired. Nicki says she\u2019s retiring. Good rappers often never really retire though. They\u2019re artists. That creativity will always flow though you and it needs to be let out. \u2014 HipHopSportsReport (@HHSReport) September 5, 2019\n\nMinaj has been busy recently: After dropping the single \u201cMegatron\u201d in June, Minaj said she was working on her fifth studio album.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a new album, yes, of course,\u201d she told Jimmy Fallon that month, but said she didn\u2019t know when it would be ready. \u201cI\u2019m not putting out the date yet, but there is one.\u201d\n\nMinaj also appears on Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s \u201cHot Girl Summer\u201d \u2014 the accompanying music video was just released Tuesday.\n\n[Megan Thee Stallion and the power of rapping for her pleasure]\n\nThe rapper has publicly mused before about whether it\u2019s time for her to quit music, such as in 2012 when she deleted her Twitter account after a song leaked.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t even giving the kid [Minaj] props for taking it back to the essence,\u201d she said on BBC Radio 1. \u201cThis is my fourth mix tape, really. The kid did like that so she could feed her fans. But really, now the kid is thinking maybe she should leave the game.\u201d\n\nMinaj has long been vocal about the ways she feels she\u2019s been given short shrift in her career. On Twitter and \u201cQueen Radio,\u201d her Beats 1 station, she has been critical of Travis Scott, Spotify, journalists, Joe Budden, Miley Cyrus and Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich.\n\n[Nicki Minaj had 100 songs on the Billboard 100, but she\u2019s still trailing the cast of \u2018Glee.\u2019 Wait, what?]\n\nIn 2015, she had no issue calling out the MTV Video Music Awards for not including \u201cAnaconda\u201d as a nominee for video of the year. (Minaj was nominated in three other categories.)\n\n\u201cIf I was a different \u2018kind\u2019 of artist, Anaconda would be nominated for best choreo and vid of the year as well,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cWhen the \u2018other\u2019 girls drop a video that breaks records and impacts culture they get that nomination.\u201d\n\n\n\nNicki Minaj attends the 2019 Met Gala in May. (Andrew Kelly/Reuters)\n\nAnd while some fans are lamenting Minaj\u2019s apparent departure, it\u2019s not uncommon for musicians to announce they\u2019re putting down the microphone only to change their minds years later. Artists including Barbra Streisand, Cher and Garth Brooks have done it. Jay-Z claimed that 2003\u2032s \u201cThe Black Album\u201d would be his last. Three years later, he put out \u201cKingdom Come\u201d and admitted his \u201cwas the worst retirement, maybe, in history.\u201d He has released four other solo studio albums since.\n\nSome longtime stars \u2014 Elton John and Paul Simon among them \u2014 go a different route and promote farewell tours. Those also happen to be surefire moneymakers and inspire healthy skepticism.\n\nBut Minaj\u2019s bombshell came with no formal marketing or announcement other than a tweet sent to her fans. Maybe her retirement will give the rapper, who has been making music for more than a decade, a chance to rest. In which case: Goodbye, hot girl summer and hello, hot girl slumber.\n\nRead more:\n\nReview: Will Nicki Minaj ever release an album that\u2019s as good as she is?\n\nNicki Minaj pulls out of concert in Saudi Arabia \u2018after better educating myself on the issues\u2019", "description": "The rapper has long been vocal about when she feels she's received the short shrift.", "authors": ["Elahe Izadi", "Pop Culture Writer", "September At Pm", "Elahe Izadi Is A Pop Culture Writer For The Washington Post.
