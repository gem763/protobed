And above all, it opens the range of possibilities to us, the chefs, who are restless and like to innovate with these products,\u201d he said.\n\nOxygarum vinegar also featured. It is obtained from a fish sauce known as garum, something very popular in Roman cuisine.\n\nChef Camila Ferraro cooked up a plate of wild boar and venison stuffing with a sauce made of aromatic herbs widely used in Roman cuisine and some oxygarum caramel. Ferraro said the once-pricey ingredient was equally valuable for savoury or sweet dishes.\n\n\u201cI think it opens the possibility of making many elaborations with this product, not only salty or intended for fish, but also for sweets or meat, or accompaniments of any kind,\u201d said Ferraro.\n\nRoman cibarium bread, made out of einkorn wheat, was also put under the spotlight.\n\n\u201cFrom my point of view, it is one of the best cereals that exist, the einkorn,\u201d said artisan baker Domi Velez.", "description": "Lamb stew with oxygarum; wild boar and venison stuffing; and cibarium bread.
