They calculated it was the same distance from its host star as Earth, putting it in the \u2018Goldilocks zone\u2019 where liquid water may be possible.\n\nSince then, our knowledge of exoplanets has skyrocketed. Equipment like Nasa\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has helped to confirm over 4,000 known exoplanets.\n\nBut Mayor says pinning our hopes on a world beyond our solar system is a stupid idea.\n\n\u2018If we are talking about exoplanets, things should be clear: we will not migrate there. These planets are much, much too far away,\u2019 he told Agence France-Press.\n\nSwiss astrophysicist Michel Mayor, winner of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics (Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone via AP)\n\n\u2018Even in the very optimistic case of a livable planet that is not too far, say a few dozen light years, which is not a lot, it\u2019s in the neighborhood, the time to go there is considerable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We are talking about hundreds of millions of days using the means we have available today.\u2019\n\nRather than jumping on Elon Musk\u2019s bandwagon and getting excited about humans becoming a multi-planetary species, the 77-year-old said issues like climate change are far more serious.\n\n\u2018We must take care of our planet,\u2019 he urged.\n\nClimate change is putting our planet at risk (EyeEm)\n\nClimate change is accelerating, with carbon dioxide levels increasing, sea levels rising and ice sheets melting faster than ever, experts have warned. That opinion comes from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), which formed part of a \u2018united in science\u2019 review for a UN climate action summit.\n\nThe WMO has published a report showing climate change and its impacts over the past five years between 2015 and 2019, which shows it was the hottest five-year period on record. The world has warmed by 1.1C since pre-industrial times, and by 0.2C just compared to the previous five year period 2011-2015, the report showed.", "description": "Take care of our own planet first", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sei_39986054-208e_1571056269.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
