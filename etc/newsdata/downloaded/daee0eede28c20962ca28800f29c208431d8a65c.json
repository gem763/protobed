In what might appear to be a radical new trial, drug addicts will be given free heroin so as to stop them from committing crimes.\n\nThe most regular offenders in Middlesbroug will be injected with Class A drug three times a day, starting this month, at a special NHS clinic. This seems to be a desperate scheme launched by the Cleveland Police.\n\nThe first of its kind scheme in England was created by under-fire Cleveland Police and Crime Commissioner, Barry Coppinger. The idea is to get addicts off the drugs by injecting them with medical grade heroin, to bring down the crime.\n\nUnsplash\n\n\"Barry Coppinger has consistently failed the people of Cleveland and its serving police officers \u2013 now he is actively undermining efforts to tackle drug addiction,\u201d The Mail quoted Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen as saying.\n\nDon't Miss 14.4 K SHARES 7.1 K SHARES 13 K SHARES 6.4 K SHARES 7.6 K SHARES\n\nHe further said, \"It is not right for a commissioner who has failed so badly, and is stepping down in a matter of months, to make the Cleveland force area a guinea pig for an experimental new drugs policy when he won\u2019t even be around to face its consequences. I\u2019m sure most right-thinking people would rather see the hundreds of thousands of pounds he is squandering on this spent on getting the basics right, by investing in frontline policing.\"\n\nMay be this makes sense technically, that if you keep offenders drugged enough, they would not commit crime, but should the focus not be to get them in Grade A rehab rather than feeding their addiction? I am just thinking out loud here - that way it helps both society and the offender, right?\n\nFb Image Credit: Twitter/Unsplash", "description": "Humans do not fear experiment and that is at times, fearsome.
