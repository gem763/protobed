We\u2019re doing well. I would much prefer a big deal and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nAnd on Monday, the US said it was blacklisting 28 Chinese entities it accuses of being implicated in rights violations and abuses targeting Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region. The move bars them from buying US products.\n\nThe meeting comes just over a week before a new round of punitive tariffs is due to be imposed on China.\n\n\u201cA large percentage of the market thinks China may roll the dice and take advantage of what they think is Trump\u2019s weakened political state, trying to push negotiations\u201d closer to next November\u2019s presidential election, said Stephen Innes, Asia-Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader.\n\n\u2013 Trump hardball? \u2013\n\n\u201cIn this context\u2026 Trump may decide to hardball the upcoming talks, suggesting there could be a high level of disappointment even relative to the market\u2019s muted expectations.\u201d\n\nStill, regional markets were enjoying some much-needed buying support Tuesday as the Chinese delegation heads to Washington.\n\nHong Kong climbed 0.7 percent as dealers returned from a long weekend break to mixed US jobs data that eased concerns about a US recession while also keeping expectations for an interest rate intact.\n\nThe gains come despite more violent protests in the city, which closed down the subway system on Saturday and caused numerous businesses to shutter.\n\nShanghai rose 0.6 percent following the week-long National Day celebrations, while Tokyo went into the break one percent higher.\n\nSydney and Singapore were each 0.5 percent higher, Seoul rose 0.9 percent, Manila jumped more than one percent, and Taipei and Jakarta both put on 0.6 percent. Wellington was slightly lower.\n\nAlso on the agenda for investors is the release this week of minutes from last month\u2019s Federal Reserve policy meeting, which will provide an idea about the bank\u2019s thinking leading up to its rate cut, while third-quarter earnings season also gets underway.\n\nOn currency markets most higher-yielding units were up against the dollar, boosted by hopes for the trade talks.\n\nBut the Turkish lira was down almost two percent after Trump threatened to \u201cobliterate\u201d the country\u2019s economy if it overstepped the mark in Syria, a day after giving Ankara a green light to invade its southern neighbour.\n\n\u2013 Key figures around 0230 GMT \u2013\n\nTokyo \u2013 Nikkei 225: UP 1.0 percent at 21,596.47 (break)\n\nHong Kong \u2013 Hang Seng: UP 0.7 percent at 26,010.07\n\nShanghai \u2013 Composite: UP 0.6 percent at 2,923.26\n\nEuro/dollar: UP at $1.0976 from $1.0970 at 2040 GMT\n\nPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2292 from $1.2297\n\nDollar/yen: UP at 107.34 yen from 107.29 yen\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: UP 34 cents at $53.09 per barrel\n\nBrent North Sea crude: UP 40 cents at $58.75 per barrel\n\nNew York \u2013 Dow: DOWN 0.4 percent at 26,478.02 (close)\n\nLondon \u2013 FTSE 100: UP 0.6 percent at 7,197.88 (close)", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Asian markets rose Tuesday as investors lock their focus on the resumption of China-US trade talks\u00a0this week, though hopes for", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/0855f3_donald-trump-has-he-prefer-hammer-out-broad-trade-deal-china-reports-say-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
