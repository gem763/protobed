Biden leads President Trump by 9 points in a hypothetical match-up in the all-important state of Wisconsin, according to a survey released Wednesday.\n\nMr. Biden held a 9-point, 51% to 42% lead over Mr. Trump, according to the Marquette University Law School poll.\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont led Mr. Trump by 4 points, 48% to 44%. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mr. Trump were tied at 45% apiece, and Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California and Mr. Trump were tied at 44% apiece.\n\nOverall, 45% of respondents said they approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing, compared to 53% who said they disapprove.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s narrow win over Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin in 2016 was crucial to his overall victory, as the state had not broken for a Republican presidential candidate since 1984.\n\nAmong potential Democratic primary voters, Mr. Biden was the top choice of 28% of respondents, followed by Mr. Sanders at 20%, Ms. Warren at 17%, Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, at 6%, and Ms. Harris at 3%.\n\nThe overall survey of 800 registered voters was conducted from Aug. 25-29 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
