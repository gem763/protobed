Wallace DeWitt, senior counsel at Allen & Overy LLP said that expanding the \u2018testing-the-waters\u2019 coverage to all issuers made good sense.\n\n\u201cThere is simply no reason to force issuers to fly blind while incurring the heavy costs associated with an offering,\u201d he said, adding that it was heartening to see the Commission implementing recommendations in the Treasury\u2019s October 2017 capital markets report - a checklist of how President Donald Trump\u2019s administration would like to see the agency perform.\n\nBut not all market participants cheered the move.\n\n\u201cBy the SEC\u2019s own admission, it proposed and adopted the rule without any concrete understanding of whether it will actually promote capital formation or pose a threat to investors,\u201d said Dennis Kelleher, President and Chief Executive Officer of Washington-based investor advocacy group Better Markets.\n\nThe markets regulator also unanimously voted on Thursday to ease its rules for approving low-risk exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in what could potentially be a major win for the $3.5 trillion market.\n\nETFs are hybrid investment products that trade on an exchange like a stock or closed-end fund.\n\nThe agency said the rule change would allow companies that sell ETFs to launch simple, straightforward funds without first seeking approval from the regulator, boosting competition and innovation.\n\nDozens of ETF companies currently operate under different requirements in a complex system they say has inadvertently allowed some firms to gain a competitive advantage.\n\nThere will be a one-year transition period for the amended rule.\n\n\u201cETFs are one of the most successful and popular financial innovations in recent years, and the SEC\u2019s new rule signifies an important step in the evolution of these funds,\u201d said Paul Schott Stevens, President and CEO of the Washington-based Investment Company Institute.\n\n(This story was refiled to correct name capitalization in fifth paragraph.)", "description": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday finalized a new rule that allows all companies to privately sound out prospective investors before filing for a stock exchange listing.", "authors": ["Katanga Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
