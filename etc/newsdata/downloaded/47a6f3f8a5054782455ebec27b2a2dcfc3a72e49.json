I think any party, no matter how good it is, if it stays in place for too long, it is corrupt, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going through,\u201d said 22-year-old student Tania Villaroel Lopez as she joined a line of voters outside a polling station near the presidential palace in central La Paz.\n\nRoberto Fernandez, 32, came with his wife Denise and their two-year-old daughter to vote at the same place. They said they feared the result of the elections would be manipulated.\n\n\u201cWe hope the end result will be respected,\u201d Fernandez said.\n\nMilton Quispe, a student, said he would vote for \u201cEvo, because he has taken care of the poor. He has known how to give us dignity.\u201d\n\nBolivia\u2019s seven million eligible voters also cast ballots to choose members of the 166-seat congress \u2014 36 senators and 130 deputies.\n\nAfter voting in his coca-growing district of Chapare, Morales, a member of the Aymara indigenous community, said he was optimistic about his chances and confident in Bolivia\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u2013 Opposition distrust \u2013\n\nMesa said he feared a rigged election after he voted in La Paz.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust in the transparency of the process, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal has demonstrated that it\u2019s an operative arm of the government. We have a very high level of distrust,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nMesa lambasted what he said was Morales\u2019 powerful grip on key organs of state in a meeting with observers from the Organization of American States last week.\n\nMorales said the maturity of Bolivia\u2019s electorate would make Sunday\u2019s polls a triumph of democracy and \u201can example for delegations and observers who visit us.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Long-time leader \u2014\n\nAs leader of his Movement for Socialism Party (MAS), Morales points to a decade of economic stability and considerable industrialization as his achievements, while insisting he\u2019s brought \u201cdignity\u201d to Bolivia\u2019s indigenous population, the largest in Latin America.\n\nBut he stands accused of corruption, and many voters are enraged at his refusal to step aside, even though the South American country\u2019s constitution bars him from running again.\n\n\u201cPower has replaced policies aimed at the whole population by others that only serve the interests of certain sectors,\u201d political commentator Maria Teresa Zegada told AFP.\n\n\u201cOpposition leaders have been persecuted, all of which has caused citizens unease and given the impression that democracy was in danger,\u201d said Zegada.\n\nBolivia\u2019s 2009 constitution, promulgated by Morales himself, limits a president to two consecutive terms of office.\n\nIn a 2016 referendum, voters defeated Morales\u2019 bid to secure public support to remove term limits, but his government rejected the result.\n\nThe constitutional court, stacked with Morales loyalists, ruled it was his right to seek re-election.\n\nHe has come under severe criticism from indigenous communities and conservationists this year as wildfires in August and September ravaged Bolivia\u2019s forests and grasslands, with activists saying his policies encouraged the use of blazes to clear farmland.", "description": "La Paz (AFP) \u2013 Evo Morales, seeking a controversial fourth term, led Bolivia\u2019s presidential election race Sunday but faces a historic second", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/04ed92_bolivia-president-evo-morales-casts-his-vote-in-chapare-in-department-cochabamba-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
