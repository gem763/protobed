It also comes in a week when Trump appears to be diverging from the Israeli leader\u2019s unwavering narrative on Iran, indicating the possibility of meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\n\n[Israel\u2019s do-over election this month may yield another deadlock. Then what happens?]\n\nNetanyahu has been fierce in his lobbying of Trump, urging him to pull out of the controversial 2015 nuclear pact with Iran and consistently pushing the United States to increase economic sanctions against its regional archenemy.\n\nLast week, Netanyahu spent a day in London, meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as well as visiting U.S. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, to discuss, he said, Iranian entrenchment in the Middle East, particularly on Israel\u2019s northern border.\n\nOn Thursday, Netanyahu headed to Sochi, Russia, to meet with President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cWe are operating on several fronts, 360 degrees, in order to ensure the security of Israel in the face of the attempts of Iran and its proxies to attack us, and we are working against them,\u201d the Israeli leader said upon his departure.\n\nAfter the publication of the Politico report, Netanyahu called the claims \u201can absolute lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a long-standing commitment and a directive from the Israeli government not to engage in any intelligence operations in the U.S.,\u201d said a statement from Netanyahu\u2019s bureau. \u201cThis directive is strictly enforced without exception.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s minister of foreign affairs and intelligence, Israel Katz, also denied that Israel had installed listening devices in the United States.\n\n\u201cIsrael does not conduct any spy operations in the United States,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe U.S. and Israel share a lot of intelligence information and work together to prevent threats and strengthen the security of both countries.\u201d\n\n[Netanyahu inaugurates Trump Heights, Israel\u2019s newest town on the Golan Heights]\n\nAmos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, wrote on Twitter that the report was \u201cfake news spiced with antisemitism.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s policy for decades has unequivocally banned spying in the United States,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI find it very hard to believe that this policy has changed.\u201d\n\nChuck Freilich, a former national security adviser in Israel and an analyst of U.S.-Israel relations, also said the report was probably false.\n\n\u201cThere are \u2018dramatic\u2019 reports of Israeli spying in the U.S. every few years, when someone in the administration does not like Israel or an Israeli policy and tries to use lingering American suspicions, ever since Jonathan Pollard, to sabotage the relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is pure nonsense. Israel learned its lesson the hard way with Pollard and made a clear decision never to risk the relationship so severely again.\u201d\n\nPollard was a former U.S. Navy analyst who was found guilty of spying for Israel in the 1980s and spent three decades in jail. He was freed in 2015 by President Barack Obama, but his fate remains a source of discontent for Israelis, with the United States continuing to refuse his request to immigrate to Israel.\n\nThe full scope of Pollard\u2019s activities has never been disclosed, but in a letter written by then-Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger to the presiding judge in the case, Pollard was described as one of the most damaging spies ever to operate in the United States.\n\nHowever, unconfirmed accounts over the years suggest that Pollard was never recruited as a spy but rather volunteered for the work after being introduced to an Israeli military officer in New York in 1984. He later told colleagues that he had been \u201ccultivated\u201d by Mossad, Israel\u2019s intelligence agency, to spy on the United States.\n\nThe belief is that while he worked at the Office of Naval Intelligence in Maryland, Pollard handed files to the Israelis, including documents relating to Arab troops, the Palestine Liberation Organization and chemical and biological warfare programs conducted by Iraq, Libya and Syria.\n\nRead more:\n\nJonathan Pollard, spy for Israel, released from prison after 30 years\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Politico\u2019s report says U.S. officials concluded that Israel was targeting cellphones, including potentially at the White House, but took no action.", "authors": ["Ruth Eglash", "Reporter Covering Israel", "The Palestinian Territories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/snzMlGFrnt4g20n3OSNitdKRnvQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HRKAPTCPGQI6TPNXIT4URTAGAU.jpg"}
