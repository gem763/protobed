We have met in Leicester, his home city, to discuss how he became an unlikely author. His autobiography has recently been published but going into print was not one of his grand ambitions.\n\n'I never thought people would be interested in hearing what I had to say,' he explains. 'If we didn't know each other and you sat next to me, you'd think I was the quietest man around.'\n\nIn his pomp, Heskey was an excellent forward. He thrived for Leicester and Liverpool, among others, joined the Premier League's exclusive 100 goals club and played at two World Cups. The main thrust of this conversation, though, concerns matters off the field.\n\nEmile Heskey is telling his story for the first time, despite being initially reluctant to do so\n\nTo be precise, the catalyst for this discussion is a chapter titled 'We Can Talk, but it's Time to Act'. It is devoted to his experience of racism. He was not going to broach the topic but it kept gnawing away at him. So he gathered his thoughts and everything came flooding out.\n\nHeskey was subjected to bigotry many times on England duty and events in Sofia on Monday were wearily familiar - he knows how Marcus Rashford, Tyrone Mings and Raheem Sterling feel. Racism has been a spectre in his life for as long as he can remember.\n\n'I was born in 1978, so you can imagine what my parents went through,' he begins. 'I remember the sign, 'No blacks, no Irish, no dogs'. I've dealt with it for so long, I'm almost desensitised to it.\n\nBeginning with his hometown club Leicester, Heskey soon made a name for himself in England\n\n'You'd react aggressively if you heard it - you know the guy who says it can't get away with it. But the thing is, he can get away with it. It's not just football. I could go to cricket and get abused.'\n\nHe refers to racism as being a 'blind spot for people' in his book and writes powerfully on Brexit. Heskey, whose grandparents arrived from the Caribbean through the Windrush Project, is no less strident when the divisive subject enters our conversation.\n\n'It's allowed people to be a bit more \"open\" with their views,' he points out. 'We're an integrated society and have been that way for a while. So why, suddenly, have they flipped because of it (a vote). I don't get it.'\n\nHeskey does not come across as angry, more dispirited. He is on the outside of the game he loves and doubts he will become a coach. The dream would be to give back to the club that launched him on the path to stardom at 16 but the reality is different.\n\nHe has been helping out at League Two side Mansfield on an ad hoc basis. Heskey had a spell coaching at Bolton before the club got into financial difficulties but has only obtained his Level Two badges and sees no point in pursuing further education.\n\n'The opportunities are not going to be there,' he argues. 'You have to show a desire, probably more so than a white person. I grew up watching John Barnes, Ian Wright, people like that. Where are they in the coaching pyramid for me to aspire to be?\n\n'There is no real avenue there. The decision-makers - where is my role model up there? My role models are people I can relate to - people who look like me. I don't see it in the pyramid.\n\nHeskey became Liverpool's record buy and played a pivotal role in the treble season of 2001\n\nWith goals pouring in, Heskey became a permanent fixture in the England national set-up\n\n'You go down to the England youth set-ups. Sixty per cent of the players are black. The FA are doing a little bit to help now (by including BAME coaches) but is that tokenism?\n\n'I applaud them for trying. But are they just putting some in to say, \"He is the face for black people?\" We don't just want a face. I don't want to be there for tokenism. I want to work. I want someone to say to me, \"You can make a difference\". I would love to help kids.'\n\nIt's not as if he doesn't have a c.v. Heskey was propelled into the top flight by Martin O'Neill and enjoyed a fine time at Leicester before Gerard Houllier shattered Liverpool's transfer record to sign him for \u00a311million in 2000.\n\nHe went on to play the best football of his career at Anfield but his first few months on Merseyside were torturous.\n\n'A lot of the things I have included even some of my best mates won't know about,' he says. 'You had to hide stuff because you are masculine. On the pitch, I absolutely loved it. Off the pitch, I struggled a lot.\n\nHeskey was on target in one of England's most iconic ever victories, beating Germany 5-1\n\n'When I was at Leicester, in the first team, I'd go to where my mates were at college and sit with them. But it got to the point where I couldn't find a barber in Liverpool! I remember lying on the floor, crying. \"Have I done the right thing?\" I had to snap out of it.'\n\nThat he did. Over four successful years, Heskey helped Liverpool qualify for the Champions League for the first time and was a key a member of the squad who won the League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup in 2001.\n\n'I'll tell you this funny story,' he says, a smile lighting up his face. 'We drew with Barcelona then beat them 1-0 at home in the UEFA Cup semi-final. I swapped shirts with Rivaldo in the Nou Camp. Then, after the game, Patrick Kluivert gave me a signed shirt!\n\n'He wrote, \"To the diver Heskey! Best wishes, Patrick Kluivert\". I had it at my house. And you know what? I used to take all that for granted.\n\nWhen I moved a few years ago I was putting things in boxes and thought to myself, \"Where are these shirts? That was one of the best moments of my career!\" I end up going to my dad's house in Antigua and there they are, hanging up! He's got my first League Cup medal from Leicester, too!\n\nHeskey returned to the pitch recently, scoring the winner for Liverpool Legends vs Rangers\n\n'I never put this in the book, either, but my treble winning trophies got nicked. All the medals were in the safe in my house. The ones that didn't get nicked were the ones that my dad's got. So the UEFA Cup, the League Cup, the FA Cup... everything. Gone.\n\n'What can you do?' he asks. 'I have got the memories. The treble, scoring in the 5-1 against Germany - people still tell me where they were on the night we won in Munich.\n\n'Leicester... I don't sit down and look at what I have achieved but when I did, I was like \"Wow!\" I played in an iconic time.'\n\nAnd to think Heskey believed people wouldn't be interested in hearing his story.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW BY DOMINIC KING: In his pomp, Heskey was an excellent forward.
