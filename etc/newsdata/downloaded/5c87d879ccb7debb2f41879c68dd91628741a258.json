A soft breeze wafts a cloud of exhaust toward the journalists. It smells like a bus station out here.\n\nThe president walks out of the White House and approaches the eager mob. He says something into the boom mics, but this, too, is swallowed by the noise of the grinding machinery.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMr. President,\u201d shouts a reporter over the chopper. \u201c[Unintelligible] Turkey . . . Syria . . . Kurds . . . [unintelligible]?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Trump isn\u2019t taking questions today, a rarity for him and a disappointment for the journalists. He spins on his heels and heads toward the waiting helicopter. The boom mics slump.\n\nThe cumbersome South Lawn \u201cgaggles\u201d \u2014 as the president\u2019s chopper meetups are informally known \u2014 have become a signature motif for Trump, and they\u2019re among his most frequent engagements with the media. Unlike his irregular Oval Office press \u201csprays\u201d or the odd news conference, the helicopter encounters are a regularly scheduled event, typically occurring whenever the president heads out of town or comes back into it. Wednesday\u2019s brief helicopter stop-and-talk was the 75th Trump has conducted since taking office, according to Mark Knoller, a CBS News White House correspondent who tracks the president\u2019s media practices.\n\nAD\n\nBut a question has always seemed to hover over the ritual: Why?\n\nAD\n\nWhy meet the press in the open-air equivalent of an airport departure lounge? The White House has a perfectly nice press briefing room \u2014 indoors, climate-controlled, no helicopter noise \u2014 but the president prefers to stalk the South Lawn, come heat, humidity, wind, insects or winter\u2019s frost.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s nothing more than a matter of efficiency and further accessibility,\u201d says Stephanie \u00adGrisham, the White House press secretary. \u201cThe press are always out there prior to his departure anyway, so it\u2019s natural for him to stop and take questions. . . . It\u2019s not like we call the press to the lawn just so he can talk to them \u2014 they\u2019re already there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nExcept that reporters follow the president everywhere they\u2019re permitted and would eagerly assemble for a chance to question the president at any time. So \u201cefficiency\u201d seems like the least of it.\n\nAD\n\nInstead, reporters and others say Trump seems to prefer the freewheeling Q&As because they\u2019re to his advantage. The format is a win-win for Trump, enabling him to grab the spotlight while marginalizing the press, both aurally and visually.\n\nAs Wednesday\u2019s brief encounter made clear, even people standing a few feet from the president can\u2019t make out the questions over the chopper\u2019s engines. Trump himself has frequently asked for questions to be repeated. (\u201cYou\u2019ve got to talk louder,\u201d he\u2019ll say. . . . \u201cSay again.\u201d) This din acts as a kind of camouflage, reporters say, enabling Trump to ignore questions that he doesn\u2019t like and to move on to those that he\u2019d prefer to answer. \u201cHe\u2019d never be able to get away with that in a press conference,\u201d one reporter says as she walks away from the lawn Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nAn idling helicopter also tends to eliminate subtlety and nuance in the questions themselves. Because it\u2019s difficult to communicate much more than a word or phrase with a Sikorsky whirring a few feet away, reporters can\u2019t engage in \u201cgrandstanding,\u201d as former White House press secretary Sean Spicer once described the behavior of reporters who go on too long.\n\nAD\n\nFurther, the reporters asking questions are barely seen. Unlike formal news conferences, in which there are multiple fixed cameras, journalists haul their own cameras to the South Lawn. This limits the number of \u201ccutaway\u201d shots \u2014 secondary pictures designed to break up a continuous image \u2014 and keeps the focus squarely on Trump.\n\nThe setup also frees Trump from being hemmed in by a lectern or a chair when he\u2019s taking questions. He usually paces up and down the press line on the South Lawn, calling on reporters at random, answering rapidly and then moving on to the next shouted question. His freedom of movement closes off follow-up questions or skeptical rebuttals.\n\nAD\n\nIn all, the chopper gaggles are \u201ca dominance ritual,\u201d says Todd Gitlin, a professor at the Columbia School of Journalism. \u201cIt\u2019s set up to make him look like he\u2019s in command, and he\u2019s lording it over [the news media].\u201d Even the name \u2014 \u201cgaggle\u201d \u2014 suggests something demeaning, notes Gitlin: \u201cYou\u2019re a bunch of geese, and you\u2019re eating out of his hand.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the absence of daily press briefings, the helicopter gaggles provide limited access to the president and news about him, says Frank Sesno, a former CNN anchor and White House correspondent who directs the media and public affairs program at George Washington University. But for the most part, he says, they are \u201clittle more than presidential spin cycles. . . . He is not there to answer detailed, nuanced or tough questions. Instead, we have the president playing press secretary on his turf and terms. And he gets mileage from these things.\u201d\n\nPerhaps more than any other reporter, former ABC News White House correspondent Sam Donaldson knows how this game is played. Donaldson famously shouted questions at President Ronald Reagan as the commander in chief strained to hear \u2014 or feigned straining to hear \u2014 over Marine One\u2019s engines, too.\n\nAD\n\nBut Donaldson says Trump\u2019s chopper Q&As are wholly different from Reagan\u2019s, both in number and kind.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy observation is that Trump sees it as easy way out of holding a press conference,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a press conference in any accepted sense that we had in the past. It\u2019s just another way for him to limit the press.\u201d\n\nBut Donaldson expresses a kind of grudging admiration for the strategy. Trump, he says, \u201ccommands the scene imperially. I know his base loves it. He\u2019s like a lion tamer out there. If he had a whip and a chair he\u2019d be\u201d a Las Vegas performer.\n\nGiven limited options, White House correspondents eagerly scramble to cover Trump\u2019s South Lawn appearances, sometimes leading to disorderly scenes. \u201cDon\u2019t run!\u201d several people called as the Secret Service led a long line of journalists through the West Wing and out past the Rose Garden for Trump\u2019s truncated appearance Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nThe chaos \u2014 all that equipment, all those bodies \u2014 prompted the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association to step in last month in an attempt to keep order.\n\nAD\n\nThe organization distributed guidelines to its members spelling out their marching order, literally, for assembling on the lawn. Pool TV cameras, for instance, are in \u201cwave 1,\u201d while \u201cguests or interns in a non-newsgathering capacity\u201d take up the rear in \u201cwave 4.\u201d There\u2019s also a list of dos and don\u2019ts. (Reporters are advised not to bring \u201cladders, step-stools, selfie-sticks, tripods or boom-mics,\u201d these being reserved for working photographers and TV camera crews.)\n\nJonathan Karl, the WHCA\u2019s president and a veteran correspondent for ABC News, says the guidelines have helped streamline the process, at least somewhat.\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, the more opportunities reporters have to ask questions of the president, any president, the better,\u201d Karl says. But he adds that the South Lawn \u201cavailabilities\u201d are no substitute for formal news conferences and regular White House briefings.\n\nAD", "description": "On the White House lawn, a helicopter whirs nearby, and a freewheeling presidential news conference commences.", "authors": ["Paul Farhi", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Q7XS9JD8sAoq7Z09pOSHlsgrwGA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3J22EJXV2MI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
