So sweet!\n\nIt seems the little one has really taken a shine to the country too, as Harry also later says, \"He [Archie] was looking out the window. He has found his voice now and he was bouncing up and down. He was making more noise than he has ever made before and he is smiling the whole time.\"\n\nPhoto credit: Getty Images More\n\nOne fan on Twitter even said spotting the intimate off-camera moment was her favourite part of the documentary.\n\nMy favourite part of Harry & Meghan: An African Journey.

But I love him dearly and you know the majority of the stuff [rumours of a rift] is probably \u2014 well, the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing. But as brothers, you have good days and you have bad days.\"\n\n\n\nIf you didn't manage to catch the programme last night, it's still available on ITV Player for 29 more days.\n\nFollow Jennifer on Twitter and Instagram\n\nLike this article?
