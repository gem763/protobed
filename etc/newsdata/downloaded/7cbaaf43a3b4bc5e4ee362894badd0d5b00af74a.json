Harry danced a bit as a musical welcome greeted them in the township of Nyanga, whose location was not made public in advance because of security concerns.\n\nViolent crime is so deadly in parts of Cape Town that South Africa\u2019s military has been deployed in the city, and its stay was extended last week. Frustration over high unemployment and lack of services also has exploded into protests and attacks on foreigners elsewhere in South Africa in recent weeks.\n\nBritain's royal couple Prince Harry and Meghan Duchess of Sussex, move with dancers on their arrival at the Nyanga Methodist Church in Cape Town, South Africa, Monday, Sept. 23, 2019. Courtney Africa\u2014Africa News Agency/AP\n\n\u201cAs someone who has visited this amazing country many times, and as someone who regards Cape Town as a uniquely special place in Africa, I wanted to ensure that our first visit as a family \u2013 with my wife by my side \u2013 focused on the significant challenges facing millions of South Africans, while acknowledging the hope that we feel so strongly here,\u201d the prince said.\n\nThe royal couple also was meeting Monday with former residents of District Six, a vibrant mixed-race community that was relocated from the inner city during South Africa\u2019s harsh period of apartheid, or white minority rule, that ended in 1994. Their visit also will focus on wildlife protection, entrepreneurship, mental health and mine clearance \u2014 a topic given global attention by Harry\u2019s late mother, Princess Diana, when she walked through an active mine field during an Africa visit years ago.\n\nHarry later this week will break away for visits to Botswana, Angola and Malawi.\n\nThe couple arrived in a South Africa still shaken by the rape and murder of a university student, carried out in a post office, that sparked protests by thousands of women tired of abuse and impunity in a country where more than 100 rapes are reported every day.\n\nThis is \u201cone of the most unsafe places in the world to be a woman,\u201d President Cyril Ramaphosa said last week, announcing new emergency measures and vowing to be tougher on perpetrators.\n\nWhile the royal visit wasn\u2019t causing the kind of excitement seen at times in other parts of the Commonwealth, some in South Africa said they were happy to see the arrival of Meghan, who has been vocal about women\u2019s rights. \u201cWe are encouraged to hear your president take the next steps to work towards preventing gender-based violence through education and necessary changes to reinforce the values of modern South Africa,\u201d Meghan said.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, began their first official tour as a family Monday with their son, Archie, in South Africa.", "authors": ["Nqobile Ntshangase", "Cara Anna"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/meghan-harry-africa-tour.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
