(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)\n\nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Robert Evans, the Paramount executive who produced \u201cChinatown\u201d and \u201cUrban Cowboy\u201d and whose life became as melodramatic and jaw-dropping as any of his films, died on Saturday night. He was 89.\n\nEven though Hollywood history is filled with colorful characters, few can match the tale of Evans, whose life would seem far-fetched if it were fiction. With his matinee-idol looks but little acting talent, Evans was given starring roles in a few movies and then, with no studio experience, was handed the production reins at Paramount in the 1960s. When he left the exec ranks, his first film as a producer was the classic \u201cChinatown,\u201d and he followed with other hits, like \u201cMarathon Man\u201d and \u201cUrban Cowboy.\u201d Eventually, his distinctive look and speaking style turned him into a cult figure, and he had the distinction of being the only film executive who starred in his own animated TV series.\n\nHis life was a continuous roller-coaster. Amid the successes, Ali MacGraw left him for Steve McQueen, her costar in the 1972 \u201cThe Getaway,\u201d a love triangle that got huge media attention. (MacGraw was the third of Evans\u2019 seven wives.) In 1980, Evans was arrested for cocaine possession and a few years later, was involved in an even bigger scandal: the murder of would-be Hollywood player Roy Radin during the production of \u201cThe Cotton Club.\u201d Due to his association with Radin, Evans became a material witness in the execution-style slaying, though no proof of Evans\u2019 knowledge of or connection to the murder was ever established.\n\nAlfred Eisenstaedt via Getty Images Then VP of Paramount Pictures Robert Evans studying his script by the pool at his home.

When he eventually resurfaced at Paramount in the \u201990s, his production track record was mostly undistinguished (\u201cThe Saint,\u201d \u201cSliver\u201d). But by then his larger-than-life persona was already the stuff of Hollywood legend. Evans parodied himself in the film \u201cBurn, Hollywood, Burn\u201d (1998), and Dustin Hoffman, a longtime friend, borrowed liberally from Evans in creating the character of an outrageous producer in the 1997 satire \u201cWag the Dog,\u201d earning an Oscar nomination in the process.\n\nParamount Pictures via Getty Images Producer Robert Evans (left) with director John Frankenheimer on the set of the film, 'Black Sunday', 1976.

Before the age of 18 he had worked on more than 300 radio shows and the occasional TV show and play. A collapsed lung forced him to recuperate for a year, and when he returned, he realized he\u2019d lost his momentum. He worked his charms as a salesman at the sportswear firm Evan-Picone, co-founded by his brother Charles.\n\nSeveral years later, however, his show business career was revived: In the perhaps apocryphal tale, he was spotted by the pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel by actress Norma Shearer, who asked him to played her deceased husband, the legendary MGM exec Irving Thalberg, in the film \u201cThe Man of a Thousand Faces.\u201d Darryl Zanuck then cast him as a bullfighter in the 1957 version of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Sun Also Rises.\u201d The other actors pleaded with Zanuck to replace Evans, but Zanuck sent a telegram saying \u201cThe kid stays in the picture,\u201d which provided the title for his eventual autobiography. Evans\u2019 dark good looks carried him only so far, however. His stiff onscreen presence in those movies and in \u201cThe Fiend Who Walked the West\u201d (1958) and \u201cThe Best of Everything\u201d (1959) did not warm the hearts of reviewers, however, and he returned to the garment industry.\n\nAfter Evan-Picone was sold to Revlon (netting Evans $2 million, according to some sources), he decided to return to the industry in a producing capacity. He purchased the rights to a novel, \u201cThe Detective.\u201d New York Times reporter Peter Bart chronicled Evans\u2019 tale in an article that caught the attention of Fox executives Richard Zanuck and David Brown, who put him in charge of such projects as \u201cAchilles Force\u201d (which was never made) and \u201cThe Detective,\u201d starring Frank Sinatra. But his stay at Fox was brief.\n\nHe befriended and charmed Charles Bluhdorn of Gulf & Western, which owned Paramount Pictures. The born salesman recognized another born salesman when he met him. In 1966 Bluhdorn controversially named the neophyte Evans VP in charge of production. By 1969 he was exec VP of worldwide production.\n\nEvans\u2019 early Paramount tenure included such monumental flops as \u201cPaint Your Wagon\u201d and \u201cDarling Lili,\u201d which were Bluhdorn\u2019s pet projects. Evans oversaw disappointments including \u201cCatch-22\u201d and the 1974 \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d\n\nBut they were more than offset by Evans\u2019 successes, starting with \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d (1968), \u201cRomeo and Juliet,\u201d \u201cGoodbye, Columbus,\u201d \u201cLove Story\u201d and \u201cThe Godfather\u201d films. The degree to which he personally deserved credit for any of these has always been debated, and even Evans claims that some of the best decisions made during his tenure, particularly with respect to \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d were arrived at over his objections.\n\nEvans hired Bart at Paramount; Bart eventually joined Variety in 1989, and profiled Evans in his 2011 book \u201cInfamous Players: A Tale of Movies, the Mob, (and Sex).\u201d\n\nAs a studio ambassador Evans was a success. His attention to day-to-day production, however, soon deteriorated, exacerbated by his public divorce from MacGraw and growing cocaine dependency. He clashed openly with Francis Ford Coppola on \u201cThe Godfather\u201d (and was slighted by Coppola when he accepted his screenplay Oscar). After Barry Diller was brought in over him in 1974, Evans eased into a producing deal. His first crucible was \u201cChinatown,\u201d a tempestuous but ultimately successful enterprise that was nominated for 11 Oscars.\n\nAfter that Evans started to slowly go downhill even as a producer. Thriller \u201cMarathon Man,\u201d starring Dustin Hoffman, was a hit in 1976, and 1977\u2032s \u201cBlack Sunday\u201d did OK but did not live up to expectations. His tennis drama \u201cPlayers\u201d (starring MacGraw) was a flop, and neither \u201cUrban Cowboy\u201d nor \u201cPopeye\u201d (both 1980) were big enough hits to restore his golden-boy reputation.\n\nIn 1980, at age 50, he was convicted of cocaine possession, during a period when widespread drug use was plaguing the industry and tarnishing its reputation nationally. Evans\u2019 Rat Pack-style behavior was by then quickly falling out of fashion in an increasingly buttoned-down corporate town.\n\nA personal dream, \u201cThe Cotton Club,\u201d became a never-ending nightmare, taking up several years of Evans\u2019 life and almost $50 million. The hybrid of music and gangsters found Evans begging Coppola to take over the reins. The results were uneven but artistically interesting; the production was tied to underworld money and, in attempting to raise more funds for the film, Evans became involved with Radin, whose murder seemed to be a case of life imitating art. The scandal cast a large shadow over Evans that he never successfully overcame. \u201cThe Cotton Club,\u201d released by Orion Pictures in 1984, went down in flames.\n\nEvans planned to make an acting comeback in 1985 in \u201cThe Two Jakes,\u201d a sequel to \u201cChinatown\u201d to be directed by Robert Towne (who wrote the original). But he had not grown as an actor and, soon after production began, Evans was fired. The film was shut down, only to be revived in 1990 under the direction of Jack Nicholson, who co-starred with Harvey Keitel. Evans was distanced from the sequel, which was a failure.\n\nHe returned to Paramount in the early \u201990s as a producer, but the salacious \u201cSliver\u201d (1993) and \u201cJade\u201d (1995) were both significant failures. The comicbook-like \u201cThe Phantom\u201d (1996) also sank without a trace. In 1997 Evans produced \u201cThe Saint,\u201d based on the long-running TV espionage-adventure series. He\u2019d been nurturing the project for several years and hoped the film would be the first entry in a franchise. But the movie, starring Val Kilmer, didn\u2019t turn out as well as expected and the sequels never came to pass.\n\nHis private life once again made the headlines when Evans\u2019 name was mentioned among the customers for Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss\u2019 service. An entire chapter on his sexual habits was detailed in the salacious and hyperbolic book \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Make Love in This Town Again.\u201d Evans had already published a frank memoir of his life, 1994\u2032s \u201cThe Kid Stays in the Picture,\u201d admitting some of his virtues and his vices.\n\nJ.Emilio Flores via Getty Images Producer Robert Evans, photographed at Paramount Pictures.

Emilio Flores/Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nIn 1998 Evans suffered a stroke that left him paralyzed on one side and unable to speak, but he eventually made a full recovery after much therapy.\n\nHe made a triumphant return in some sense with the 2002 documentary adaptation of \u201cThe Kid Stays in the Picture,\u201d directed by Nanette Burstein and Brett Morgen, in which Evans idiosyncratically discussed his life.\n\nTaking advantage of the increased exposure, he exec produced \u201cKid Notorious,\u201d a 2003 animated series based on his unique persona for Comedy Central. The same year he produced the successful romantic comedy \u201cHow to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.\u201d\n\nEvans maintained an office on the Paramount Pictures lot, and continued to develop projects, though none came to fruition: He had long planned a movie based on the renegade car builder John DeLorean, written by James Toback to be produced with Brett Ratner; he also had in development a sci-fi movie set in a futuristic Manhattan and based on a graphic novel, \u201cNYC2123\u201d; \u201cWhip Smart,\u201d the story of a young dominatrix to be directed by Catherine Hardwicke; and a superhero film, \u201cForeverman,\u201d based on an original character created by Stan Lee and to be produced with Lee.\n\nHe was married and divorced seven times, first to actress Sharon Hugueny, then to actress Camilla Sparv and, after his divorce from MacGraw, to former Miss America Phyllis George. His brief 1998 marriage to actress Catherine Oxenberg was annulled. Thereafter he was married to Leslie Ann Woodward and Victoria White.\n\nHe and MacGraw had a son, Josh, an actor and director.
