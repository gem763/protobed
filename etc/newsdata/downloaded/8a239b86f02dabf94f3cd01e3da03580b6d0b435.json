Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden at third place in a recent poll of likely Democratic caucus attendees in Iowa.\n\nWarren, who surged in the poll as Biden fell to second place, made an aggressive ad buy last week, spending at least $10 million in advertising in the first four states to vote in the 2020 Democratic primary, including Iowa.", "description": "After raising $25 million in the last three months, the Sanders campaign will launch its first TV ads of the cycle in Iowa.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d939de82100002d00f91db6.jpeg?cache=xmxnbkvr3q&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
