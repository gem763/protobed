She\u2019s also a bit of a master at living sustainably, having gone without buying new clothes for four years.\n\nElla also eats a plant-based diet, works at a packaging-free grocery store, and limits her flights to one a year to reduce her carbon footprint.\n\nBasically she\u2019s doing great at this whole protecting the earth thing, and we can all learn from her.\n\nThe student vowed to stop buying fast fashion after watching The True Cost, a documentary about the fashion industry, in 2015.\n\nElla, of Vancouver, Canada, said: \u2018I was in grade 10 when I watched The True Cost which shows every aspect of the fast fashion industry, from working conditions in factories to the unsustainable fabrics used.\n\nElla buys all her clothes from thrift stores, which she says has made her style more creative (Picture: Ella Kim Marriott /SWNS.COM)\n\n\u2018Billions of dollars worth of clothing end up in landfills. There are also a lot of issues around how factory workers are treated and the poor labour laws and conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The transportation of the clothes mean that trucks and planes are used for just shipping over clothing. I wanted to stop supporting that industry.\n\n\u2018I decided to take it on as a challenge for one year to see if I could go a full year without buying anything new.\n\n\u2018But after that first year, I just decided to stop buying fast fashion altogether.\u2019\n\nShe even buys swimsuits second hand (Picture: Ella Kim Marriott /SWNS.COM)\n\nElla decided to spread word of her challenge to inspire others to get involved.\n\nSome took part, but Ella still found herself in some awkward moments when her friends wanted to shop in Forever 21.\n\nRather than going to high street shops, Ella buys her clothes from second-hand stores, which she says has improved her personal style.\n\n\u2018I actually grew up shopping in thrift stores as my family was low income,\u2019 she explained. \u2018The only thing that is inconvenient is if there\u2019s one specific item that I want.\n\n\u2018But the cool thing about thrift stores is that it improves your style. I think I look better now. You have to get creative. You end up with really unique pieces.\n\n\u2018It completely elevates how you end up putting clothes together.\u2019\n\nElla has also cut down her travel to just one return flight a year (Picture: Ella Kim Marriott /SWNS.COM)\n\nThe only clothes Ella buys new are underwear and socks, as they\u2019re tricky to come by in thrift stores.\n\nBut even for these items, Ella makes sure to give her money to sustainable brands. Thankfully, that means they last for a long time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe says: \u2018In the four years I have been doing this, I haven\u2019t bought a single pair of underwear.\n\n\u2018People constantly think they need new things but it\u2019s pretty hard to rip your underwear.\n\nShe hopes to inspire others to make a change (Picture: Ella Kim Marriott /SWNS.COM)\n\n\u2018I bought period underwear so I wouldn\u2019t have to buy feminine hygiene products anymore. I even buy swimsuits secondhand.\u2019\n\nIf Ella is done wearing a particular item, she returns it to the thrift store for another person to enjoy, making sure to keep her clothes in good condition so they can continue to be worn.\n\nElla also returns clothes to thrift stores once she no longer needs them.\n\nIt\u2019s not always easy \u2013 Ella finds it hard to resist buying artists\u2019 merch at concerts \u2013 but the student hopes she can show other people that it\u2019s worth trying to buy consciously.\n\nShe said: \u2018Everyone has exceptions and nobody is perfect. We just have to do what we can manage.\u2019\n\nMORE: Meet the teens making climate change memes to deal with ecoanxiety\n\nMORE: What is retinol and how should you use it in your skincare routine?\n\nMORE: Couple wows the internet with their nude, pizza-filled engagement shoot\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Ella Kim Marriott wants to inspire other people to challenge themselves to live more sustainably.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90429068_1571478317.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
