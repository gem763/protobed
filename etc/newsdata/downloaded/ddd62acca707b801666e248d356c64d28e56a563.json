Both vets and owners can log a horse\u2019s physical, mental and social development, creating an evidence base on what constitutes normal and abnormal equine behaviour, and what defines good, effective and humane training.\n\nThis project builds on a similar project for dogs, which has collected information on over 85,000 dogs and been used in more than 70 research studies that have revealed behavioural differences that relate to head and body shape and the astonishing effect of desexing on behaviour.\n\nNow it is the horses\u2019 turn\n\nWe have created an online behavioural assessment package for horses and ponies, called the Equine Behaviour Assessment and Research Questionnaire (E-BARQ) that collects anonymous data for horse behaviour researchers, veterinarians and coaches. It\u2019s a not-for-profit project that allows the global horse-folk community to donate their observational data to the University of Sydney and gain useful benefits in return.", "description": "Since ancient times, horse behaviour, and the bond between horses and humans, has been a source of intrigue and fascination.", "authors": ["Paul Mcgreevy", "Bethany Wilson", "Dr Michelle Lenore Hyde", "Kate Fenner", "Logan Booker", "Hayley Williams"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/l/2017/11/horsemelbcup2017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
