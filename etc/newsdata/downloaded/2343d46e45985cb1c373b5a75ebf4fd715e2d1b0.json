And with 4.9 million followers on her perfectly curated Instagram , it's likely that influence will continue to grow.\n\nHer single \"Malamente\" got 20 million YouTube views in three months\n\nThat's according to Pitchfork . \"Malamente\" also secured her two Latin Grammys in 2018.\n\nShe's got a range of celebrity fans, collaborating with J Balvin, Ozuna, Billie Eilish, James Blake and Pharrell, among others. Pedro Almod\u00f3var cast her in his latest film, \"Pain and Glory,\" while Burberry chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci has designed looks for her (including the beaded black dress she wore on the VMAs red carpet).\n\nThe Obamas are already fans\n\nRosal\u00eda and J Balvin's hit \"Con Altura\" was featured on the Obamas' Summer Playlist, which Barack Obama tweeted out earlier this week.\n\nThe Catalan singer has the presidential stamp of approval.

Rosal\u00eda has a writing credit on every single song, and was also involved in the production and arrangement process.\n\nAnd she's stressed the importance of having women in the studio, saying at the Latin Grammys, \"I'm going to have to keep fighting until I find the same number of women in the studio as there are men.\"\n\nAt last year's Latin Grammys, Rosal\u00eda took home two trophys.

Her debut album, 2017's \"Los \u00c1ngeles,\" was effectively a flamenco album, whereas \"El Mal Querer\" blends the genre with a greater range of musical styles.\n\nRosal\u00eda, who grew up on the outskirts of Barcelona, studied the traditional music for years, even going to college for the craft. She said in an interview, \"To learn flamenco is to swallow your pride .\"\n\nRosal\u00eda's music and aesthetic are heavily influenced by flamenco. Credit: Ollie Millington/Getty Images\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, she explained her attraction to the art form. \"I would say, for me, flamenco is so pure, so raw,\" she said. \"I love pop culture but sometimes I miss the root, the rawness. With flamenco, I felt like I always needed it, I just didn't know it. It's purer than anything else for me. If you don't put the truth into it, it won't work. I don't know what it will be but it won't be flamenco.\"\n\nShe's been accused of cultural appropriation\n\nFlamenco is an art form rooted in Andalusia's Gitano community (as Romani people are known in Spain), while Rosal\u00eda is not gitana and was born in Catalonia, northern Spain. As a result, she's been called out for cultural appropriation: Some have specifically targeted her use of an Andalusian accent that's not her own, as well as words from the gitano Cal\u00f3 language, while others have objected to her overall approach to flamenco and its aesthetics.\n\n\"Flamenco is suffering a kind of institutional racism that whitewashes the art form and markets it like a piece of meat wrapped up in plastic,\" gitana activist Noelia Cort\u00e9s told Public Radio International.\n\nRosal\u00eda has responded to the controversy, telling the Guardian, \"Music is beyond races, beyond territories.\"\n\nRosal\u00eda collaborated with J Balvin on the award-winning single \"Con Altura.\" Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images", "description": "The 25-year-old flamenco singer was nominated for four awards at MTV's 2019 Video Music  Awards, taking home two for her song \"Con Altura\" with J Balvin.", "authors": ["Leah Asmelash"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190827094706-rosalia-vmas-super-tease.jpg"}
