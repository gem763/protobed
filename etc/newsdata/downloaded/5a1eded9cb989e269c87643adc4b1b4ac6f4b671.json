Add Syria as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Syria news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\n\"We're doing very well in Syria with Turkey and everybody else that we're dealing with. We have secured the oil. We have a lot of oil,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. \"We just did a great thing in Syria where we're getting our troops out. We took over oil.\"\n\nThe president\u2019s latest comments came as the Pentagon considers a plan that would possibly keep some U.S. troops in eastern Syria, in addition to supplying heavy weaponry to assist the troops in their defense of the oil fields in the region. On Wednesday, Trump seemed to signal support for the proposal at a cabinet meeting, claiming it's not necessary to keep American troops in Syria, \"other than that we secure the oil.\"\n\nManuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper confirmed the U.S. will use some mechanized forces, which could include tanks, to protect the oil fields.\n\n\"We are now taking some actions, I\u2019m not going to get into the details, to strengthen our position in Dayr az Zawr to ensure that we can deny ISIS access to the oil fields, because we want to make sure they don\u2019t have access to the resources that may allow them to strike within the region, to strike Europe, to strike the United States. Otherwise all of the other forces are intended to be returned home,\" Esper said at a press conference in Brussels on Friday.\n\nEsper said he's spoken with Turkey's defense minister who confirmed Turkish forces have taken control of ISIS prisons and have recaptured some but not all of the estimated 100 escaped ISIS prisoners.\n\nEarlier in the day Trump repeated his statements that troops that have left Syria will be returning to the U.S., even as some are stationed to protect oil fields near Turkey.\n\nManuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\n\u201cOur soldiers have left and are leaving Syria for other places, then COMING HOME!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nTurkey fully understands not to fire on the Kurds as they leave what will be known as the Safe Zone for other fairly nearby areas. I don\u2019t have to repeat that large scale Sanctions will be imposed for violations. Going well! ISIS secured by Kurds with Turkey ready as backup..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2019\n\n....COMING HOME! We were supposed to be there for 30 days - That was 10 years ago. When these pundit fools who have called the Middle East wrong for 20 years ask what we are getting out of the deal, I simply say, THE OIL, AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR SOLDIERS BACK HOME, ISIS SECURED! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2019\n\nTrump is not folding under bipartisan pressure and criticism to shy away from removing troops from Syria. He also added, in all caps, that oil and ISIS in the region is \u201csecured\u201d without going into details on what exactly that means.\n\nTrump on Thursday vowed in a tweet that ISIS would never have control of the oil fields in eastern Syria, suggesting that Kurds should maybe protect the fields.\n\n\u201cWe will NEVER let a reconstituted ISIS have those fields!\u201d Trump said on , using an acronym for a group that the U.S. military and Syrian Kurdish forces have largely defeated. \u201cPerhaps it is time for the Kurds to start heading to the Oil Region!\u201d\n\nABC News' Luis Martinez contributed to this report.", "description": "President Donald Trump continues defending his decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria on Friday, saying the administration is doing", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/trump-ap-jt-191025_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
