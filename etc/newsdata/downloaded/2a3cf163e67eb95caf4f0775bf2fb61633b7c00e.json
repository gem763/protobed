(Mandel Ngan/Pool/Reuters)\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi because it was committed by Saudi government employees.\n\nBut he denied ordering the murder, despite a CIA assessment that found that Mohammed probably authorized it.\n\n\u201cIf there is any such information that charges me, I hope it is brought forward publicly,\u201d he told interviewer Norah O\u2019Donnell, according to a transcript of the episode to air Sunday evening.\n\nThe comments by Mohammed, Saudi Arabia\u2019s day-to-day ruler, came just days before the anniversary of Khashoggi\u2019s death and as the Saudi leadership is struggling to turn the page on a grisly episode that cast an unforgiving light on Mohammed\u2019s human rights policies and Saudi Arabia\u2019s complicated relationship with the United States.\n\n[Houthis say they killed or wounded 500 Saudi-led coalition fighters and captured 2,000, show footage of soldiers, corpses]\n\nThe crown prince made similar statements about accepting responsibility to PBS\u2019s \u201cFrontline,\u201d which released a lengthy documentary about Mohammed online on Saturday. In the interview with Martin Smith, he denied any prior knowledge of the killing.\n\nKhashoggi, who wrote columns criticizing the crown prince\u2019s policies in The Washington Post, was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, by agents dispatched from the kingdom. Saudi prosecutors later said two of the crown prince\u2019s most trusted aides had been involved in the planning of what was portrayed as a botched attempt to bring Khashoggi back alive to the kingdom.\n\nOne of the aides, Ahmed al-Assiri, the former deputy chief of Saudi Arabia\u2019s intelligence agency, is standing trial for the murder in Saudi Arabia. The other, Saud al-Qahtani, a former media adviser to the crown prince, has not been charged with any crime, according to diplomats and others familiar with the case.\n\nThe \u201cFrontline\u201d documentary quoted a high-level adviser to Mohammed as saying that \u201cprosecuting someone so close to the crown prince would be politically disruptive.\u201d\n\n[Amid tension with Iran, U.S. Air Force shifts Middle East command center from Qatar to South Carolina]\n\nIn the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Mohammed appeared to deny that any of his confidants were involved in the plot to kill Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t clear information or evidence that someone close to me did something to that effect,\u201d he said in comments that appeared to contradict the assertions made by Saudi prosecutors.\n\nThe crown prince also played down the kingdom\u2019s notoriously harsh suppression of free speech. \u201cThere is no threat from any journalist,\u201d the crown prince said, speaking of Khashoggi. \u201cThe threat to Saudi Arabia is from such actions against a Saudi journalist.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, which was conducted in the coastal Saudi city of Jiddah, Mohammed discussed the attacks on Saudi oil facilities this month that Saudi and U.S. officials have blamed on Iran, calling for \u201cfirm action to deter\u201d Tehran.\n\nHe was asked about allegations that Saudi Arabia has tortured prominent women\u2019s rights activists imprisoned by the government.\n\n\u201cIf this is correct, it is very heinous,\u201d he said of the allegations, which were made public nearly a year ago and brought to the attention of Saudi authorities.\n\n\u201cI will personally follow up on this matter,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more\n\nSaudi crown prince on Khashoggi killing: \u2018I get all the responsibility because it happened under my watch.\u2019\n\nCIA concludes Saudi crown prince ordered Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s assassination\n\nJamal Khashoggi\u2019s death made the Saudi crown prince a pariah.
