Rather, the typical H-1B visa immigrant to a for-profit company is someone doing low-level coding, tech support, or accounting,\u201d he added. \u201cWe're not getting the same benefits from someone doing tech support as we get from someone who founds a company or generates new scientific knowledge.\"\n\nDoran said that while he is a proponent of more highly skilled migration, \u201cprimarily for ethical reasons,\u201d there are external factors that the white paper does not take into account.\n\n\u201cWhen one looks at the papers that rely on [these external factors], one finds many examples of papers which identify substantial groups of losers from highly skilled immigration,\u201d Doran said.\n\n\u201cMany of these papers are written by people who, like me, are supporters of highly skilled immigration, but acknowledge that there will be winners and losers,\" he said. \"None of those papers are cited in this white paper.\"", "description": "More than 50 deans of U.S. business schools penned an open letter Tuesday to President Trump and congressional leaders, calling for reforms to immigration policies affecting high-skilled workers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/dartmouth_111518getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
