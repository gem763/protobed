the SNP will table a vote of no confidence in the prime minister and attempt to dissolve parliament this week so an election can be held on 5 December.\n\nMs Swinson said: \u201cBoris Johnson has missed his \u2018do-or-die\u2019 deadline (of 31 October) and is now asking parliament to give him a general election and time for him to ram through his Brexit Bill through parliament.\n\n\u201cWe need to get Boris Johnson out of office, unlock the gridlock in parliament and give people the chance to vote to stay in the EU.\u201d\n\nThe SNP leader said he wanted an election this year \u201con parliament\u2019s terms not on the prime minister\u2019s\u201d.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue

He tweeted: \u201cI am not getting bounced in to this ... it was \u201cmadness\u201d to have a winter election. Any election now will be a proxy Brexit referendum and Hard Brexit could be won in 6 weeks.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "The Liberal Democrats and the SNP have joined forces to try and trigger a general election in December, according to reports.
