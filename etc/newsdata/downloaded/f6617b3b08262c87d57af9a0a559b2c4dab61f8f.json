Genius isn't without its moments of crazy, as they say.\n\nHis world views never stop being borderline controversial, and now in a recent interview with Apple Music host Rob Lowe, he unravelled some more dark things from his past and how he blames social media for it.\n\nReuters\n\nKanye West in the interview (while promoting his Jesus Is King' album) confessed how during his early days he got addicted to pornography after he got his hands on his father's Playboy magazine. While he has been trying to recover from this addiction, according to him, social media has only made this struggle more difficult.\n\nAccording to Kanye West, social media is \"modern-day cigarettes.\"\n\nHowever, oddly, even though he despised social media, he expressed his immense admiration for Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.\n\nAccording to Kanye, Dorsey is \"incredibly smart and a visionary.\" His admiration was partially for his pilot stock-trading app that allows people to invest in a stock for a dollar. He stated, \"You've gotta honour living founders, those are the great great great great grandfathers of what's being built.\"\n\nDon't Miss 806 SHARES 119 SHARES\n\nReuters\n\nSocial media and smartphone addiction are one of the few major issues surrounding the teens these days. Kids are competing to be popular and cooler on social media by posting everything about their life and creating unhealthy benchmarks to compete with others.\n\nAccording to a recent study from the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), people addicted to phones have reported a considerable loss in sleep as well as drop-in work productivity, blaming their phones for it.\n\nThe researchers replicated questions from a similar 2005 survey, and found that 31.3 percent of people in 2018 blamed their smartphones for losing sleep. In 2005, that was the complaint for just 5.5 percent of people.", "description": "We know Kanye West as an amazing musician with a rather unusual side that might not be up the alley of many people.
