The pretty decoration is super-easy: a cocktail stick and stripes of pink icing are all it takes\n\nFor the meringue buttercream\n\n100g caster sugar\n\n1 large egg white\n\n85g unsalted butter, softened\n\nFor the fondant icing\n\n250g fondant icing sugar\n\nPink food-colouring gel\n\nFor the genoise\n\nfold the foiled parchment to divide the cake tin into three 20 x 10cm sections with the parchment side facing upwards, and grease with melted butter.\n\nHeat the oven to 190c/fan 170c/ 375f/gas 5. Tip the eggs and sugar in a bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water.\n\nWhisk until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture reaches 43c/109f on the sugar thermometer.\n\nWeigh the mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer and record the weight (to help you divide it later).\n\nWhisk the mixture in the mixer until it is thick and mousse-like and leaves a ribbon trail when you lift the whisk out.\n\nMeanwhile, divide the flour evenly between three small bowls. Do the same for the butter. Stir the vanilla into one bowl of butter.\n\nStir the raspberry flavouring and a small drop of pink food colouring into the second bowl of butter, and the lemon zest and a small drop of yellow food colouring into the third.\n\nDivide the whisked egg mixture into three bowls. Working with one bowl of egg mixture, flour and butter at a time, sift the flour over the egg mixture and fold in. Add the butter and fold in \u2014 work quickly to prevent the mixture collapsing.\n\nRepeat with the remaining bowls to give three mixtures \u2014 vanilla, raspberry and lemon.\n\nPour each into a section of the cake tin and bake for 12-15 minutes, until the tops spring back when pressed. Cool a little in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\nFor meringue buttercream\n\nMelt the sugar in 3 tablespoons of water very gently in a pan over a low heat. Meanwhile, whisk the egg white to soft peaks in the clean bowl of a stand mixer.\n\nOnce the sugar has dissolved, increase the heat to a rapid boil until the syrup reaches 121c/250f on a sugar thermometer. Remove the pan from the heat.\n\nWith the whisk at full speed, slowly pour the hot syrup onto the egg whites in a thin stream. Keep whisking until the meringue is thick and glossy and has cooled to room temperature.\n\nGradually add the butter, whisking after each addition until the buttercream is smooth and thick. Chill until firm.\n\nTo assemble\n\ntrim the sponges so they are identical in size and height. Spread half the buttercream over the vanilla sponge and top with the raspberry sponge.\n\nSpread the other half of the buttercream over the raspberry sponge and top with the lemon sponge (you might not need all the buttercream).\n\nFor the fondant icing\n\nSift the icing sugar into a bowl and add 1\u00bd-2 tablespoons of water to mix to a stiff, dropping consistency.\n\nSpoon one quarter of the icing into a small bowl and colour it pink. Spoon the pink icing into the piping bag fitted with a writing nozzle.\n\nSpread the white fondant icing over the top (not the sides) of the lemon sponge.\n\nPipe fine lines of icing across the width of the cake, spacing them 1cm apart.\n\nUsing a cocktail stick, gently drag the icing lines in opposite directions through the white fondant to feather.\n\nCut the cake into six even slices and serve.\n\nChocolate beetroot cake\n\nThis is Rosie\u2019s mum\u2019s chocolate beetroot cake \u2014 a moist, super-easy bake that everyone loves.\n\nThis is Rosie\u2019s mum\u2019s chocolate beetroot cake \u2014 a moist, super-easy bake that everyone loves.

Using a wooden spoon, stir in the flour, baking powder, cocoa, sugar and eggs, then stir in the cooled butter and chocolate mixture until fully combined.\n\nDivide the mixture between the two cake tins and bake for 30-35 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centres comes out clean.\n\nWhen the icing is ready, spread one sponge, top-side down, evenly with half the icing. Stack the second sponge on top and spread with the remaining icing to finish\n\nCool in the tins for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\nTo make the icing, put the condensed milk in a small pan with the vanilla and warm over a low heat for 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously to prevent burning, until the milk is hot but not boiling.\n\nRemove the pan from the heat and add the butter and chocolate.

Add the icing sugar and stir until completely dissolved.\n\nIncrease the heat and boil, stirring, for about 4 minutes, until the mixture has been reduced by about a third and is syrup-like and thick enough to coat the back of the spoon (it will look thick and frothy). Remove the syrup from the heat and allow it to settle to look like a thick custard.\n\nCover the top of one cake with another layer of buttercream, making sure you leave enough for a generous topping, then stack the other cake on top, giving you a four-tiered cake\n\nThen, add the crushed coffee beans or instant granules and stir until evenly distributed.\n\nPour the mixture onto the lined baking tray and spread out quickly and evenly so that it reaches the edges of the tray.\n\nBake the brittle for 12-15 minutes, until golden and caramel-like.

Sandwich each cut cake with a generous amount of buttercream frosting.\n\nCover the top of one cake with another layer of buttercream, making sure you leave enough for a generous topping, then stack the other cake on top, giving you a four-tiered cake.\n\nTop the cake with the remaining buttercream. Crush the brittle and sprinkle it over the top of the cake, to decorate.\n\nYou\u2019ll have more brittle than you need \u2014 try sprinkling it over your morning porridge, or over vanilla ice cream.\n\nSticky gingerbread loaf\n\nThis is a family recipe that has been passed down to Michael from his great grandmother via his grandmother and mum.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s one of the first cakes he and his mum ever baked together.\n\nThis is a family recipe that has been passed down to Michael from his great grandmother via his grandmother and mum.
