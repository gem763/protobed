The days before that saw seemingly disconnected \u201cwhale\u201d transactions going to exchanges.\n\nChinese Traders Not the Whole Story\n\nBut then, the markets were on fire, with the common cause seen as \u201cthe Xi Effect\u201d. The recent statement by Chinese president Xi Jinping that the country was taking a pro-blockchain stance, seemed to spark a market rally.\n\nThe most active traders, however, were not the Chinese, but Western markets, according to research by TokenAnalyst.\n\nThe Xi effect visualized: A look at #bitcoin on-chain transactions during the days of the 40% price spike.

The TokenAnalyst reports that over 6,000 more transactions took place outside of the Chinese trading session, and moved over twice the amount of BTC volume.\n\nIt\u2019s true that crypto markets don\u2019t sleep, but this also shows that a rally in BTC is a self-expanding phenomena. Bot trading and automated activity, in addition to transfers between exchanges, may have added to the rampant activity.\n\nBTC Transfers and Value Slow Down\n\nCurrently, the transfers over the Bitcoin network are on the decline. BTC saw around 300,000 transactions, as seen on a regular day. The value of transactions shrank in the past day, from above $1.9 billion to about $1.6 billion.\n\nBTC on-chain activity and pending transactions often pick up during times of growing volatility, especially with growing prices. But the actual rally happens within an hour or even minutes, without warning.\n\nThe rally was followed by lowered on-chain activity as the prices unraveled. BTC sank to $9,124.93 ahead of the US opening hours on Wednesday, with the potential to erase some of this week\u2019s gains. Trading volumes are still higher than usual at $27 billion in the past 24 hours.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate which exchange had the biggest effect or triggered the BTC rally. Most of the BTC trades are distributed evenly across crypto-to-crypto exchanges. However, markets like Binance and OKEx attract attention, as well as Bitfinex for its connection to Tether (USDT) transfers.\n\nSmaller transfers continue, as USDT and other stablecoins allow for arbitrage and moving funds between exchanges.\n\nChinese traders, however, went on to support altcoins, and achieved robust gains for a basket of digital coins and tokens with interests in the Chinese market. TRON (TRX) preserved its gains at $0.020, boosted by the Huobi Global program to deposit TRON-based USDT.\n\nEthereum-based USDT is also highly active, picking up transfers in the past 24 hours, as shown by the Token Analyst\u2019s data:\n\n\ud83d\udce2 24H #USDT ERC20 Network Stats: \ud83d\udcb5 $USDT ERC20 On-Chain Volume: $2B (+28.4%)\n\n\ud83d\udc48 Active Senders: 31K (-4.0%)\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Active Recipients: 37K (+12.8%) Visit https://t.co/u90eafzR5J for more info \u2014 TokenAnalyst (@thetokenanalyst) October 30, 2019\n\nThe supply of Ethereum-based USDT has grown to about 2.023 billion, and is currently the more active stablecoin. Leading exchanges have switched to using this type of asset, and the token transfers are also related to price action.\n\nOmni-layer USDT has also been highly active in the past day:\n\n\ud83d\udce2 24H #USDT OMNI Network Stats: \ud83d\udcb5 $USDT OMNI On-Chain Volume: $882M (+219.3%)\n\n\ud83d\udc48 Active Senders: 8K (-8.3%)\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Active Recipients: 10K (-9.3%) Visit https://t.co/u90eafzR5J for more info \u2014 TokenAnalyst (@thetokenanalyst) October 30, 2019\n\nAs for BTC, most exchanges except for Binance see net outflows of coins.\n\nBTC has settled to a volatility of 4.01%, with the fear and greed index at 53 points, up from 20 points during the recent sell-off event. At this point, the transfers have slowed down, and BTC seems to enter another period of relative stability.\n\nWhat do you think about the recent BTC rally?
