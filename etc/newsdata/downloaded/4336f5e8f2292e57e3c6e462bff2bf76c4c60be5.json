I could see her skin colour had changed and her eyes were closed.'\n\nIn his statement, Mr Price said he was awoken by Lyla-Rae crying at between 3am to 3.40am on July 13, 2018, and took her out of her basket and gave her a feed.\n\nHe added: 'She did not want to go back to sleep. She was wide awake so I put the TV on and put her on her back in the crook of my right arm.\n\n'She was lying between my body and inside my right arm, and Shannon was to my right. She had not woken. I had not intended to sleep with Lyla-Rae in my bed.'\n\nWhen Mr Price woke up a few hours later he said Lyla-Rae was unresponsive.\n\nHe added: 'She was still in the same position and so was l, although her head had moved slightly. She felt cold and she was not breathing.'\n\nHe said he carried out CPR after calling for an ambulance but she was later pronounced dead at North Devon District Hospital.\n\nMs Maund said Lyla-Rae was born healthy, was bottle fed and was 'doing well.'\n\nPaying tribute to her after the inquest, Lyla-Rae's grandmother Emma Ayres said: 'Please be aware of the risks of co-sleeping, especially when you smoke as the risks are higher.\n\n'We never thought something like this would happen to our family and the pain and anger of losing our beautiful angel will never go away. We will love you forever Lyla.\n\n'She was a beautiful happy baby. She brought joy to all who knew her. I and the rest of the family miss her like crazy.'\n\nMedical experts told an inquest at Exeter Coroners' Court (pictured) that they were unable to determine a reason for Lyla-Rae's death, but said one possible cause was accidental suffocation\n\nA pediatric post-mortem examination was carried out by Dr Andrew Bamber who concluded the cause of death was unascertained.\n\nHe told the inquest he could not rule out 'risk factors' such as accidental suffocation due to overlying.\n\nHe added there was evidence of a mild viral infection, but confirmed it would not have caused her death.\n\nDr Bamber said: 'We are left with no definite reason why she passed away.'\n\nPolice confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death and no evidence of neglect was found.\n\nRecording an open conclusion, coroner Philip Spinney said: 'It simply means the evidence does not fully explain how Lyla-Rae came about her death.'", "description": "Lyla-Rae Ayres died in the arms of her mother's partner Ben Price, when he fell asleep while feeding her at her home in Exeter, Devon.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/13/19835140-0-image-a-21_1571313653425.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
