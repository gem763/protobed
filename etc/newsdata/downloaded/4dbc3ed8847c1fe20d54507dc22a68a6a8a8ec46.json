The Walt Disney Co. accounted for about half of all ticket sales in U.S. and Canada theaters on the season, which came to a close Sunday with the Gerard Butler action thriller \u201cAngel Has Fallen\u201d topping the box office for the second weekend.\n\nSummer ticket sales finished 2% behind last year, according to data firm Comscore, a slight downturn that came despite an unprecedented display by Disney DIS, -0.42% . The studio\u2019s approximate $2.2 billion in domestic summer box office is greater than that of all the major studios combined.\n\nSummer, which for Hollywood runs from the first weekend in May to Labor Day, traditionally ends with a whimper as few new releases seek to draw audiences over the holiday weekend. That was especially true this weekend as nothing new dented the top 10. Lionsgate\u2019s LGF.A, -4.95% \u201cAngel Has Fallen\u201d came on top again with an estimated $11.6 million.\n\nThe final numbers on Hollywood\u2019s summer didn\u2019t add up to the box-office bonanza that some predicted. Instead, the main storyline on the summer came to be the yawning gap between Disney and the rest of the industry. Disney finalized its $71 billion acquisition of 20th Century Fox in March, but it was the studio\u2019s own offerings that propelled its market dominance.\n\nFive of Disney\u2019s films crossed $1 billion this summer, including the season\u2019s biggest hit, \u201cThe Lion King.\u201d It currently ranks seventh all-time globally with $1.56 billion in ticket sales. \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d ($2.796 billion) opened in late April, just before the summer began. \u201cToy Story 4\u201d and \u201cAladdin\u201d both easily cleared $1 billion. The only non-Disney film in the summer\u2019s top four was Sony\u2019s SNE, +0.33% \u201cSpider-Man: Far From Home,\u201d and that film was produced by Disney\u2019s Marvel Studios.\n\nDisney has been the market leader for the last four years in Hollywood as its high-priced acquisitions \u2014 Lucasfilm, Pixar, Marvel, and now Fox \u2014 have given the studio the intellectual property firepower for a movie world increasingly focused on franchises.\n\nOnly one original film this summer ranked among the top 10, and it came in 10th. Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time ... in Hollywood\u201d will have made an estimated $130.8 million through Monday domestically, plus sizable ticket sales abroad. It, along with \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d helped lead Sony to its best summer since 2006 \u2014 but a distant No. 2 to Disney.\n\nDisney\u2019s success has been a welcome dose of reliability for theater owners in need of sure-hits amid widespread anxiety over the rise of streaming. And it has prompted fears of cultural monopoly.\n\n\u201cFor the industry, I think it\u2019s a point of stress, to put it mildly. Other studios are now strategizing around Disney. That\u2019s what you have to do,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cBut lest we think Disney was the only game in town, there were other studios that found opportunities within the calendar.\u201d\n\nLionsgate was among those that eked out some breathing room. Along with its August successes (\u201dAngel Has Fallen,\u201d \u2018\u2019Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\u201d), the studio\u2019s \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 3 \u2014 Parabellum\u201d was, with $170.9 million, one of the summer\u2019s biggest successes.\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s important to dispel that audiences are only going to see Marvel and Pixar and the big tentpole,\u201d said David Spitz, president of domestic distribution for Lionsgate. \u201cMovies like \u2018Scary Stories\u2019 and \u2018Good Boys\u2019 and \u2018Angel Has Fallen\u2019 prove that there is an audience for that. \u2018Good Boys\u2019 was very encouraging because prior to that it was: \u2018Comedies are dead. They\u2019re just for streaming.\u2019 And that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood Boys,\u201d from Comcast\u2019s CMCSA, +0.20% Universal and the first R-rated comedy to land No. 1 in more than three years, proved that conventional wisdom is sometimes wrong. But other acclaimed comedies that were expected to pop \u2014 such as Amazon\u2019s AMZN, -0.57% \u201cLate Night,\u201d United Artists\u2019 \u201cBooksmart\u201d and Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cLong Shot\u201d \u2014 didn\u2019t.\n\nCounterprogramming often simply didn\u2019t work. And neither did gloomy-looking critically panned movies such as \u201cGodzilla: King of the Monsters\u201d and \u201cDark Phoenix.\u201d They were among the season\u2019s biggest flops.\n\nMusic continued to fuel modest hits, including \u201cRocketman\u201d from Viacom\u2019s VIA, -0.94% Paramount and Universal\u2019s \u201cYesterday.\u201d But by the end of summer, as the lackluster performance of Warner Bros\u2019 Bruce Springsteen-inspired \u201cBlinded by the Light\u201d showed, that trend may be waning, too.\n\nDergarabedian noted, though, that the summer season isn\u2019t quite what it used to be. Studios now spread their biggest movies around the calendar more freely. Add \u201cEndgame\u201d to the totals and the summer looks a lot better. Next week will bring \u201cIt Chapter Two\u201d from AT&T\u2019s T, +0.31% Warner Bros, which is expected kick off the fall season with a bang. After it comes, anticipated sequels for \u201cFrozen,\u201d \u2018\u2019Star Wars\u201d and \u201cJumanji,\u201d along with big-budget originals including \u201cAd Astra,\u201d \u2018\u2019Ford v Ferrari,\u201d \u2018\u2019Gemini Man\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Irishman.\u201d\n\nBut after a sluggish spring, overall ticket sales are down 6.3% on the year according to Comscore. And when factoring in inflation and higher ticket prices, not since 1992 have fewer summer tickets been sold.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.
