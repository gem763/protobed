While there have been plenty of rumors about what the Queen thinks of Meghan, ranging from love to hate, historian David Starkey confirmed that Meghan officially has Her Majesty\u2019s approval.\n\nThe Queen likes Meghan,\u201d Starkey told the Daily Mail\u2019s Richard Eden. \u201cThe Queen immediately made her and Harry ambassadors for the Commonwealth, which is the only thing the Queen really cares about.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is apparently one thing the Queen isn\u2019t thrilled with: Meghan\u2019s past as a television actress.\n\n\u201cThe problem is she has brought too much Hollywood entitlement with her,\u201d he said, adding that there are similarities between Meghan and Harry\u2019s mother, the late Princess Diana. \u201cDiana behaved like a celebrity. She behaved as though she\u2019d been born in California He\u2019s married his mother!\u201d\n\nStarkey also addressed Meghan and Harry\u2019s use of a private jet this summer, which many criticized due to Harry\u2019s outspoken advocacy for the environment.\n\n\u201cHer hypocrisy is just the same as any other member of the Hollywood elite: they all proclaim their eco-sensitivity while flying their private jets,\u201d he said.\n\nMeghan and Harry don\u2019t always advertise every good deed they do, however. The couple recently donated thousands to a swimming instructor who teaches children in Mozambique how to swim.\n\n\u201cI said to my colleague, \u2018That has to be Harry and Meghan,\u2019\u201d Adam Knight told Harper\u2019s Bazaar about the donation, which said was by \u201cArchie HMW.\u201d \u201cWe made some calls and were able to verify that it was from them, which is just incredible. Without that donation and support this would not be happening.\u201d\n\nSounds like something that would be Queen-approved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The official word is out.", "authors": ["Erika Harwood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/y9SwxCcgZ4J7AOZGnr8vhA--~B/aD01Nzg7dz0xMTUwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/70f38f5b301d5a644b6ba53185912f39", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
