Protesters later returned to the medicine store to set it on fire.\n\nIn Yau Ma Tei, an elderly man who was accused of stealing at least three mobile phones from a trashed Xiaomi store was tied up by protesters who insisted they did not condone looting.\n\nA tense stand-off also erupted near the Park Lane Shoppers\u2019 Boulevard as protesters repeatedly hurled petrol bombs at the Tsim Sha Tsui station as officers fired rounds of tear gas at them from inside.\n\nProtesters cut down a surveillance camera near a Yau Ma Tei MTR exit with an electric chainsaw, before setting it on fire. They then threw petrol bombs inside at least four metro stations through their closed exits \u2014 forcing the partial suspension of Tsuen Wan line and the closure of at least 14 stations. The city\u2019s railway operator MTR has been the target of protesters who accused the operator of aiding the police\u2019s clearance actions.\n\nBy evening, a bomb disposal robot \u2014 believed to be deployed for the first time during the four-month protests \u2014 had also detonated a suspected explosive device inside a cardboard box placed at the intersection of Lai Chi Kok Road and Tong Mi Road in Tai Kok Tsui. The marauding protesters also set a traffic light controller ablaze, apart from the fires they started in the shops the broke into.\n\nIn Mong Kok, riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the mob but later appeared uncertain whether to continue their actions. As they retreated, protesters threw bricks at their vehicles, breaking the windows. Police then returned to clash again with the mob, before retreating yet again.\n\nFigo Chan Ho-wun, the vice-convenor of the front who pushed ahead the banned march alongside three pan-democrats in their personal capacity, claimed an estimated 350,000 people had taken part in it.\n\nA 25-year old frontline protester, surnamed Tang, said protesters had resorted to more violent behavior because peaceful protests had not worked.\n\n\u201cCarrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor just won\u2019t listen,\u201d the banking staffer said, referring to the city\u2019s chief. \u201cWe must continue with our fight.\u201d\n\nThe police force condemned the mob, as it urged passers-by to stay away from the scenes of chaos.\n\n\u201cFires set by rioters seriously affect personal safety of members of the public. Indoor fires can quickly get out of control and burn residents living above the shops,\u201d the statement read.\n\nPolice also said two men, aged 31 and 34, were arrested for \u201cpossession of an offensive weapon\u201d in Tai Po and on suspicion of \u201csupplying weapons\u201d to protesters in Kowloon on Sunday. Weapons including 42 suspected petrol bombs and raw materials for creating paintballs were found in two vehicles \u2014 a taxi and a seven-seater car \u2014 during a search.\n\nIn a statement released just before midnight, the Hong Kong government strongly condemned the acts of \u201crioters who completely disregard law and order.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the city\u2019s embattled leader Lam is set to leave for Japan on Monday to attend the enthronement ceremony of Emperor Naruhito to be held the next day. She is expected to return on Tuesday.\n\nReporting by Phila Siu, Linda Lew, Kimmy Chung, Karen Zhang, Karen Yeung and Jeffie Lam", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3c/95/344c568d4c88ab83752f0fa484d0/20191020-tear-gas-hk-protest-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
