Then to see 66 and jump into first place my head was spinning a bit. But I was like \u2018wait, I can\u2019t celebrate too early because I have still got three girls to go\u2019.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, none of them were able to respond. The minor medals went to Chinese duo Liu Shiying (65.75m) and Lyu Huihui (65.49m) with German Christin Hussong relegated to fourth place.\n\nBarber came into the championships ranked No 2 in the world this year courtesy of a brilliant season highlighted by a personal best of 67.70m in Lucerne in July. But she looked out of sorts in the qualifying round in Doha on Monday, only scraping through to the 12-woman final in 10th place.\n\nBarber settled her nerves on Tuesday night with a solid opening throw of 62.95m, but with one round to go in the final she had only improved to 63.65m and a podium finished looked unlikely.\n\nAfterwards Barber paid tribute to her coach and husband. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful and I wouldn\u2019t be able to do this without him,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd especially tonight my performance couldn\u2019t have been achieved without him on the fence.\n\n\u201cThere were technical cues as much as anything but just to have the support to say \u2018you\u2019re good\u2019 or \u2018cool, calm down a little bit\u2019. The emotional connection is what makes it so special and so enjoyable.\u201d\n\nIt was only the second throwing gold medal won by an Australian at a world championships. Barber also became just the ninth Australian athlete to win a world championships title.\n\nEarlier, Brandon Starc has continued his impressive late-season run of form, advancing to the men\u2019s high jump final with a minimum of fuss.\n\nAfter a career-best campaign in 2018, which included Commonwealth gold and the Diamond League crown, Starc has done it tougher this year after being diagnosed with a bulging disc in his back in February. But the 25-year-old\u2019s form and fitness have improved the longer the year has gone on.\n\nWorld Athletics Championships: Lyles wins men's 200m gold \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\n\u201cOne miss at 2.26 and the first attempt at 2.29 and that was it,\u201d he said. \u201cFive jumps all up so that was pretty good. The main thing was just to get through to the final. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter how pretty it was.\u201d\n\nLondon Olympics finalist Steve Solomon scraped into the men\u2019s 400m semi-finals. Solomon claimed the last of the qualifying berths after finishing fourth in his opening-round heat in 45.65 seconds.\n\nVeteran Lauren Boden and major championships rookie Sarah Carli both advanced to the semis of the women\u2019s 400m hurdles. Competing at her fifth successive world titles, Boden clocked 56.00 in the opening round, while Carli came home strong to finish fourth in the concluding heat in 56.37.", "description": "The Australian showed nerves of steel to produce a huge throw and win her country\u2019s first medal of the World Athletics Championships", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5d077f520491fa8d8eb9e1c1952c166ab6a05cb/0_317_4338_2603/master/4338.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c91b5cd6baab621bab761941a01bf17f", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
