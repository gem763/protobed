Chris Christie won reelection in 2013, New Jersey Republicans have lost ground in the state Legislature and have been nearly wiped out in the congressional delegation. | Paul Sancya/AP Photo Booker, struggling to gain presidential traction, keeps Senate fallback safe\n\nTRENTON, N.J. \u2014 Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s attention may be on his White House bid, but if that doesn\u2019t work out, the New Jersey Democrat has a warm Senate seat waiting for him \u2014 and not much competition from Republicans.\n\nBooker\u2019s presidential run has exposed some problems that, on their face, should be vulnerabilities for his Senate reelection in 2020. His popularity took a dip statewide after he declared his presidential campaign, as memories of former Republican Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s frequent forays to New Hampshire in 2015 and 2016 remain fresh in voters\u2019 minds. And Newark\u2019s water crisis has resurrected news about corruption that took place at the agency that controlled the city\u2019s water infrastructure while Booker was the city\u2019s mayor.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut the GOP failed to develop a strong bench under Christie, who, by the time he left office in 2017, was the most unpopular New Jersey governor since the advent of public polling. Since Christie won a landslide reelection in 2013, New Jersey Republicans have lost ground in the state Legislature and have been nearly wiped out in the congressional delegation.\n\nThe Senate seat held by Booker has so far has attracted four candidates, but none has held local elected office. Three of them have previously run quixotic independent Senate campaigns.\n\nBy comparison, most of the five New Jersey House seats that have flipped from red to blue since 2016 have attracted attention from Republican self-funders and elected officials looking to turn the seats back.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because 2020 will mark 48 years since New Jersey Republicans last won an election for U.S. Senate.\n\nLast year was particularly demoralizing for the GOP. Bob Hugin, a newly retired pharmaceutical executive and Marine veteran, spent $40 million against Democratic incumbent Sen. Bob Menendez, who had just survived a corruption trial by hung jury. Many New Jersey Democrats were panicked late into the campaign, as some polls indicated a close race. But President Donald Trump\u2019s deep unpopularity in the state, along with attacks by Menendez on drug pricing controversies surrounding Hugin\u2019s company, could not be overcome. In the end, Hugin lost by 11 percentage points.\n\nNow, with Booker likely on the ballot in 2020 and still relatively popular in New Jersey, and Trump at the top of the ticket, what seemed so close to Republicans\u2019 grasp last year looks farther away than ever.\n\n\u201cHaving spent such a significant amount of money and going up against someone who has been wounded on the Democratic side, the fact that [Hugin] he still lost by double digits, yeah that\u2019s got to hurt,\u201d Krista Jenkins, a pollster at Fairleigh Dickinson University, said.\n\nEven if Booker is on the ballot for president or vice president, he\u2019s likely to be a Senate candidate as well. New Jersey Democrats changed the law last year to ensure that Booker can appear on the ballot for Senate and president at the same time.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s wasting New Jersey\u2019s resources and time running around on a failed presidential bid,\u201d New Jersey Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt said.\n\nSteinhardt remains hopeful when discussing Booker\u2019s Senate seat, and said he\u2019s been steadily rebuilding the New Jersey Republican Party\u2019s fundraising base since taking over as chairman two years ago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever think anything is ultimately out of reach.\u201d\n\nResponding to Steinhardt\u2019s comments, Tom Pietrykoski, Booker\u2019s campaign spokesperson, said New Jersey\u2019s junior senator \u201ccontinues to fight tirelessly on behalf of all New Jerseyans to ensure their voices are heard in Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has delivered on some of the most pressing issues facing our state, including historic investment in underserved communities, landmark criminal justice reform, advancing the critical Gateway project, helping New Jersey families recover from Superstorm Sandy and much, much more,\u201d Pietrykoski said. \u201c Cory has been making his presence felt every single day, and he will never stop working for New Jersey.\u201d\n\nNone of the four Republicans lining up to run for Senate appears to be a top-tier candidate.\n\nLast month, Stuart Meissner, a securities lawyer and former federal prosecutor, announced a Senate exploratory committee \u2014 six years after running an independent campaign for Senate that he said was intended to draw attention to his call for alimony reform. He wound up with about 2,000 votes in that race.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a different Republican. That\u2019s what it boils down to. I was, in fact, a Democrat before. So I know what Democrats think like,\u201d Meissner said in an interview.\n\nMeissner said his legal experience \u2014 things like winning a $22 million settlement for a whistleblower client against Monsanto \u2014 will have cross-aisle appeal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Republicans have put up a nominee that has my experience of being a prosecutor for 11 years and on top of that represented individuals against various disreputable people on Wall Street that screwed them over,\u201d he said.\n\nHirsh Singh, an engineer who in the last two years has unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for governor and a South Jersey House seat, has already declared his candidacy for Senate and has the support of Bill Palatucci, a Christie confidant.\n\nTricia Flanagan and Natalie Rivera \u2014 who both ran for Senate as independents in 2018 and each got about half of one percent of the vote \u2014 have also declared candidacies for the Republican Senate nomination, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAll four are staunch Trump supporters, which proved to be a liability for Hugin\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cI really do line up with what President Trump is doing in the White House,\u201d said Rivera, a social service coordinator. \u201cI decided it would be better for me to run as a Republican this time, and pretty much I\u2019m just aligned with how the Republican platform is.\u201d\n\nSingh believes the Trump backlash in 2018 was fueled by the \u201cRussian-Mueller report narrative\u201d that has died down since the report\u2019s release. He also said he thinks more Trump voters will show up than before. And even as Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric threatens to alienate voters in immigrant-rich states like New Jersey, Singh \u2014 both of whose parents immigrated from India \u2014 believes his own heritage will be an asset.\n\n\u201cA lot of the tactics that the Democrat Party has utilized to garner not only the progressive vote but also the independent and minority groups to vote for them has been pointing to Republicans and basically saying they\u2019re racist,\u201d Singh said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be able to do that when you have someone who is a young Republican but at the same time I\u2019m completely open-minded and love people from across the spectrum.\u201d\n\nPalatucci, who was arguably Christie\u2018s closest confidant, said Singh brings a lot to the GOP.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good image for the party: Young guy, Indian American, great family from South Jersey,\u201d Palatucci said. \u201cAll those factors have given me the view that he\u2019s earned it. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve kind of come to support him.\u201d\n\nFlanagan did not respond to a phone call or email seeking comment.", "description": "Booker\u2019s presidential run has exposed some problems that, on their face, should be vulnerabilities for his Senate reelection in 2020.", "authors": ["Matt Friedman"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/52/95/082c48df4df585c1f6c81ef62072/sen-cory-booker.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
