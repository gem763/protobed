I can\u2019t say with certainty based on my data, but it may be because when the woman is older, it might shift the power dynamic toward greater equality.\n\n\u201cWe know from a lot of research that greater equality in a relationship tends to make couples happier, so perhaps it\u2019s the case that this arrangement is just more equitable.\u201d\n\nDr Lehmiller also suggests that relationships in which the woman is older than the man may work as they put the woman in a more dominant position.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHe added: \u201cWe know that a lot of men are into the idea of submitting to a dominant, powerful woman\u2014and they tend to see older women as having those characteristics.\n\n\u201cSo maybe it\u2019s a feeling of empowerment that ultimately underlies older women\u2019s greater feelings of satisfaction\u2014and perhaps that empowerment allows women to get more of what they want, sexually and otherwise.\u201d\n\nWhile Dr Lehmiller highlights that further research is needed, he added that he hopes the findings will reduce the stigma facing age-gap couples.", "description": "A new study by sex pscyhologist Dr Justin Lehmiller suggests that women who date younger men have more satisfying relationships", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Wireimage", "Splash News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20171476.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_13th-Annual-From-Slavery-To-Freedom-Gala.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
