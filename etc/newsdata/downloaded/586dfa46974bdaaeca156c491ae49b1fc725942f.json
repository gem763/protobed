Outside the pro-independence Omnium Cultural headquarters in Barcelona, a crowd chanted \u201cWe\u2019ll do it again\u201d - a slogan used by separatist supporters who want to hold another referendum.\n\nProtesters in Tarragona blocked the A7 highway to Barcelona and several regional roads across Catalonia, officials at the Catalan road traffic agency said. An earlier disruption to the regional train network outside the town of Girona, a separatist stronghold, had ended.\n\nMuch is at stake in how the court\u2019s decision will be received, both for Spain and for its wealthiest region. Catalonia\u2019s independence drive attracted worldwide attention and triggered Spain\u2019s biggest political crisis in decades and unnerved financial markets.\n\nSeparatist protests have been largely peaceful but police sources have said authorities are prepared for any violence. Spanish authorities are keen to avoid any condemnation from abroad of the sentence as too draconian, and the separatist movement will have to decide how to react to the ruling.\n\nThe jailed separatists said via social media that they would carry on their fight.\n\n\u201cNine years in prison won\u2019t end my optimism. Catalonia will be independent if we persist. Let us demonstrate without fear, let us move forward determinedly from non-violence to freedom,\u201d said Jordi Sanchez, who was sentenced to nine years in jail. Sanchez was the leader of the Catalan National Assembly (ANC) grassroots movement.\n\nThe regional head of Catalonia, separatist Quim Torra, called for an amnesty for all 12 leaders and said he would seek an urgent meeting with Spain\u2019s King Felipe VI and acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.\n\n\u201cWe demand the release of political prisoners and of those in exile. We demand amnesty ... for all those who have been persecuted,\u201d Torra said in a televised speech.\n\nPeople holding an Estelada (Catalan separatist flag) and pictures of Catalan politicians as they walk through Via Laetana Avenue during a protest after a verdict in a trial over a banned independence referendum, in Barcelona, Spain October 14, 2019. REUTERS/Rafael Marchante\n\n\u201cUPRISING\u201d\n\nThe longest prison term - 13 years - went to the former deputy leader of the Catalan regional government, Oriol Junqueras.\n\nThe court convicted Junqueras and eight other leaders on charges of sedition and four of them of misuse of public funds, the court ruling showed.\n\n\u201cWhat happened on October 1 was not just a demonstration or a massive act of citizen protest. If that had been the case, there would have been no criminal sentencing. It was a tumultuous uprising encouraged by the accused, among many others,\u201d the Madrid court said in its ruling, delivered in writing rather than in an open session.\n\nAfter the ruling was published, the CDR grassroots movement tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s time to rise up against the authoritarian fascism of the Spanish state and its accomplices. It is time for the #RevoltaPopular (popular revolt).\u201d\n\nThe government has said it is ready to take direct control of Catalonia as it did in 2017 if secessionist leaders break the law.\n\n\u201cThe sentence must be carried out and complied with,\u201d acting public works minister Jose Luis Abalos told public broadcaster TVE. \u201cIn Catalonia, there is a need for clear and responsible leadership on behalf of separatists.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nThe ruling is likely to colour a national election on Nov. 10, Spain\u2019s fourth in four years, and influence the direction taken by the separatist movement.\n\nAn opinion poll in July showed 48.3% of Catalans against secession and 44% in favour.", "description": "Spain's Supreme Court on Monday sentenced nine separatist leaders from Catalonia to between nine and 13 years in prison for sedition over their role in a failed independence bid, triggering protests across the region.", "authors": ["Joan Faus", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440653061&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0N8", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
