Many of them will die from it: China accounts for more then half of the world's annual liver cancer fatalities caused by hepatitis C, according to the study.\n\nThe disease is commonly spread by shared needles. Consumption of crystal methamphetamine, which has snowballed in recent years in China according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and can be taken by injection or inhalation, has contributed to the growing number of new infections, according to the WHO.\n\nIn Yi Prefecture, a mountainous region in Sichuan province along a major trafficking route with a high proportion of drug users, nearly five times the national average -- 2.8% of the population -- have hepatitis C, according to a study published in 2017 in the British Medical Journal.\n\nRead More", "description": "China has the highest burden worldwide of this liver disease which can lead to death.
