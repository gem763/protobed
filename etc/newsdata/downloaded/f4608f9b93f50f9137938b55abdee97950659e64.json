(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nMore\n\nNo matter how much you ask (and sometimes plead), getting your child to wash their hands is tough under the best of circumstances.\n\n\u201cKids are just so busy all the time that asking them to take a break to wash their hands feels like a chore,\u201d Gina Posner, MD, a board certified pediatrician at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, Calif., tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nStill, handwashing is crucial. \u201cHandwashing is an effective way to prevent respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in kids,\u201d says Katie Lockwood, MD, a primary care pediatrician at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), handwashing can prevent up to 40 percent of diarrheal illnesses and up to 21 percent of respiratory illnesses like the common cold and the flu.\n\n\u201cPeople (and kids especially) touch their eyes, nose and mouth all the time and don't even realize it. These are the main portals of entry for germs into our bodies so keeping hands clean is important to prevent germs from getting into our bodies,\u201d says Patricia Garcia, MD, a pediatrician at Connecticut Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nThe CDC actually has pretty specific instructions on how handwashing should be done:\n\nWet your hands with clean running water (it can be warm or cold), turn off the tap and apply soap.\n\nWork up a lather by rubbing your hands together with soap, making sure to lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your fingernails.\n\nScrub your hands for at least 20 seconds.\n\nRinse your hands under clean water.\n\nDry your hands with a clean towel or air-dry them.\n\nWhen it comes to soap, something like Dial\u00ae Gold is a good option, according to Charles Shubin, MD, a board-certified pediatrician with Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore.\n\nSo\u2026 how can you get kids to actually do this?\n\nKids, like adults, need to wash their hands a lot. \u201cKids should always wash their hands after using the bathroom, before eating, after touching pets, after playing outside, after coughing, sneezing or blowing their nose,\u201d says Garcia. You\u2019ll also want to remind older kids to wash their hands before preparing food, touching pet food and treats and taking out the garbage, she adds.\n\nGiven that handwashing is so crucial, but a total chore for kids, it\u2019s important to make the whole thing as fun as possible, Lockwood says. She recommends teaching your child to sing a song during handwashing to help them make the process last for 20 seconds, like having them sing the Happy Birthday song twice. Your child can also sing their ABCs or the chorus from one of their favorite songs and belt it out twice, if they seem more excited about that, Posner says. If that doesn\u2019t help, keeping an egg timer by the sink can create a fun challenge for them every time they wash up.\n\nGetting fun, foamy soaps or soaps with scents your child likes can also help, recommends Posner. Your child may also love to have you \u201csmell how clean their hands are\u201d afterward, she says.\n\nWhile you want to make the process as fun as possible, it\u2019s also crucial to set a good example. \u201cBe a good role model in washing your own hands,\u201d Shubin says. And, if they can see you having fun if the process too, even better.\n\nThis article was paid for by Dial\u00ae and created by Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s branded content team.
