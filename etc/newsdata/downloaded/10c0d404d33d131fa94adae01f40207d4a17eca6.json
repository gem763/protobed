The president ordered his administration to hold a nearly $400 million military-aid package to Ukraine days before the call.\n\nDuring the conversation, Trump reminded Zelensky the US \"does a lot for Ukraine\" and followed up by asking him to \"do us a favor, though,\" and investigate the Bidens and the origins of the Russia probe.\n\nThe details of the phone call, outlined in an unprecedented whistleblower complaint against Trump, sparked public outrage and allegations that the president and his lawyer were soliciting foreign interference in the upcoming election.\n\nBut the phone call was just one thread in Trump's and Giuliani's plan. They had put the wheels in motion months before.\n\nFormer U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, arrives on Capitol Hill, Friday, Oct. 11, 2019, in Washington, as she is scheduled to testify before congressional lawmakers on Friday as part of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump Scott J. Applewhite/AP\n\nGiuliani v. Yovanovitch\n\nIn the spring, Giuliani gave Secretary of State Mike Pompeo a folder, dated March 28, of unfounded conspiracies against the Bidens, as well as allegations of impropriety against Marie Yovanovitch, then the US's ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nIn many ways, Yovanovitch is the central thread in the Giuliani-Ukraine scandal. She was abruptly recalled from her position in May after a tumultuous stint that included frequent clashes with Giuliani.\n\nTheir main disagreement stemmed from her refusal to facilitate the former New York mayor's efforts to use official channels to push the Ukrainian government to dig up damaging information on the Bidens. Yovanovitch was also opposed to Yuriy Lutsenko, then the Ukrainian prosecutor general who was in cahoots with Giuliani.\n\n\"She refused to allow her embassy to be dragged into some sort of effort to concoct dirt for political purposes,\" a former official told The Guardian.\n\nYovanovitch testified to Congress that she was removed based on \"unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives\" and that the campaign against her was spearheaded by Trump and Giuliani beginning last spring.\n\nRead more: 8 Trump officials made stunning revelations about how the president and Giuliani weaponized the State Department\n\nNow, Yovanovitch's ouster is the focus of the SDNY's investigation into Giuliani. Specifically, prosecutors are looking at whether Giuliani was working on Lutsenko's behalf while trying to get Yovanovitch removed; if he was, it may have violated foreign lobbying laws.\n\nProsecutors are also interested in Giuliani's business interests in Ukraine. Giuliani's entanglement in the SDNY's probe first came out when two of his Ukrainian associates, the businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested and charged last week with campaign-finance violations.\n\nThe two men are accused of trying to funnel foreign money into Republican political campaigns, and Parnas in particular also worked as Giuliani's fixer in Ukraine, where he focused on looking for dirt on Biden and Yovanovitch.\n\nParnas and Fruman's efforts on Giuliani's behalf also had a domestic thread. This week, the former GOP congressman Pete Sessions was subpoenaed in the SDNY investigation to turn over documents and other information about his interactions with Giuliani.\n\nIt's unclear what exactly Sessions' role is in the Ukraine saga, but the indictment against Parnas and Fruman could offer some clues. The charging document said the two men dangled an illegal campaign donation to a US congressman while looking for their \"assistance in causing the US government to remove or recall the then-US ambassador to Ukraine.\"\n\nIn May 2018, around the time when Parnas and Fruman promised to raise $20,000 for the unidentified congressman, Sessions wrote a letter to Pompeo criticizing Yovanovitch and parroting right-wing talking points that she was working against Trump. A year later, Yovanovitch was recalled from Ukraine following what she characterized as a smear campaign by Giuliani, Trump, and others.\n\nRead more: Mick Mulvaney publicly confirms Trump held up Ukraine aid for political gain\n\nMultiple officials implicate Giuliani for running a shadow foreign-policy campaign\n\nGiuliani's outsize role in the Ukraine controversy has puzzled ethics experts and government officials, given that he is the president's personal lawyer and a private citizen.\n\nThose concerns doubled after the release of explosive text messages between three US diplomats \u2014 the former Special Representative to Ukraine Kurt Volker, the US's ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, and the US's charg\u00e9 d'affaires in the Ukrainian embassy Bill Taylor \u2014 that showed just how intricately involved Giuliani was in running a shadow foreign policy campaign to help Trump's political ambitions.\n\nIt didn't hurt that Volker and Sondland were willing participants in Giuliani's efforts.\n\nRead more: Gordon Sondland, a central figure in the Ukraine scandal, threw Trump and Giuliani under the bus in his opening statement to Congress\n\nVolker was instrumental in setting up a channel of communication between Giuliani and Andriy Yermak, a key aide to Zelensky. And he and Sondland were both enthusiastic about helping Giuliani convey to the Ukrainian president that a good relationship with Trump was predicated on Ukraine pursuing politically motivated investigations against Trump's opponents.\n\nWhen Taylor, the skeptic of the group and a career foreign-service officer, raised concerns about the US withholding military aid and conditioning a White House meeting on Zelensky caving to Trump's demands, he was shut down by Sondland.\n\nSondland and Volker have testified as part of Congress' impeachment inquiry into Trump, and both implicated Giuliani as being the president's main envoy with respect to Ukraine while distancing themselves from the controversy. Taylor is set to appear before lawmakers on Tuesday.\n\nAt least half a dozen other officials have also testified about the extent of Giuliani's involvement in Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine.\n\nRead more: Trump's presidency is disintegrating as he faces his worst 30 days since taking office\n\nFormer Mayor of New York Rudolph Giuliani during the Conference In Support Of Freedom and Democracy In Iran on June 30, 2018 in Paris, France.
