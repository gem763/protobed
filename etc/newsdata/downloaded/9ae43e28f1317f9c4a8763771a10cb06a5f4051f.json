Here's what officials knew and when.", "language": "en", "text": "The mysterious spate of vaping-related illnesses and deaths continues to grow.\n\nOn Friday the Center for Disease Control announced that at least 450 possible cases of vape-related illnesses have been reported in 33 states across the US. The illnesses have reportedly claimed at least five lives already, and doctors and other health experts fear their could be more on the way.\n\n\"While the investigation is ongoing, CDC has advised that individuals consider not using e-cigarettes, because as of now, this is the primary means of preventing the severe lung disease,\" Dr. Dana Meaney-Delman of the CDC said on a Friday press call, reports Business Insider's Hilary Brueck.\n\nWhile it's not yet clear what exactly is causing these illnesses, it seems to affect younger people \u2014 mostly men \u2014 who are vaporizing cannabinoids like THC.\n\nThe culprit, according to some experts, are chemicals like vitamin-E acetate that are used to emulsify THC and CBD in illegal, unregulated vaporizers.\n\n\"Even if most lung-injury cases are traced to chemicals used to emulsify THC or CBD into illegal vaping \"juices,\" it doesn't let legally sold, nicotine-based e-cigs off the hook. They must do more to ensure safety of their products by engaging review process and ending youth use,\" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former FDA commissioner, said on Friday.\n\n\"Legitimate e-liquids are generally based on chemicals that are water-soluble, not oils that can cause acute lung injury. High levels of vitamin E acetate were found in nearly all cannabis-containing vapes tested by NYS Department of Health. Nobody should use illegal vape products,\" Gottlieb said.\n\nHere's what officials knew when. We'll update this as more information comes to light:\n\nAugust 17:\n\nAssociated Press\n\nCDC officials say they are actively investigating almost 94 cases of vape-related illnesses in 14 states. That number would grow to 200 cases in 22 states.\n\nOfficials haven't yet determined the specific causes of the illness, but it is thought that oils and chemicals used to emulsify THC, CBD, and nicotine in illicit vapes is to blame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 23:\n\nReuters\n\nThe first vape-related death is reported in Illinois.\n\nThe person, who has remained unnamed, was hospitalized with severe breathing difficulties, according to officials. He was reportedly using e-cigarettes to consume nicotine.", "description": "The CDC is investigating at least 450 possible cases of vape-related illnesses in 33 states across the US.
