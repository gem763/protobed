Essential packing tips every student should follow", "language": "en", "text": "Starting a new school year is tough enough, but there's even more pressure if you're going overseas to start boarding school. Exciting new experiences and independence await, but before that, one must pack.\n\nI remember last year's last-minute shopping trips, panicking about every missing item and deliberating about the necessity of bringing all seven pairs of shoes on my school\u2019s packing list, so I'm sharing the tips that past me would have greatly appreciated.\n\nWhat are British boarding schools really like?\n\nComfort is key\n\nEvery good night\u2019s rest starts with your environment, which for me includes a comfy pillow. I made the mistake of forgetting mine on my first term abroad, which became one of my biggest regrets that year. The one the school provided was basically a sack filled with what I assume to be dried beans, like a bigger version of the bean bags we\u2019d sometimes use in P.E.\n\nThe familiarity of the scent and feel of my own pillow helped with homesickness, too.\n\nLiven up your space Definitely bring a few decorations to spice up your room and make the space yours for the year. Give it a bit more personality, a place you can call a home away from home, and it\u2019ll relieve those bouts of homesickness we all get every once in a while.\n\nPictures will liven up your room for sure; it\u2019s reassuring to be surrounded by familiar faces. Seeing your loved ones and friends smiling at you from your walls can cheer you up when you\u2019re down.\n\nHow to deal with homesickness while you're abroad\n\nFood, food, food\n\nI cannot stress this enough, food from home is great for when you\u2019re homesick, particularly those first few months away. Stuff your suitcase full so you can savour the taste of home until your next visit back.\n\nA rice cooker is an excellent addition to your baggage if you\u2019re studying in Europe or a country where rice is not the carb of choice.\n\nInstant noodles aren\u2019t exactly the healthiest dinner option, but it\u2019s always good to have them on hand for when you just don\u2019t feel like going to the canteen. Bonus points for the ease and quick clean-up.\n\nBe smart: you don't need a winter jacket in Singapore\n\nBe smart and pack for the climate. If you\u2019re going somewhere with four distinct seasons, make sure to pack a winter coat and some warm clothes. If your destination is a country where hot and humid weather is expected year round, don\u2019t worry about packing them.\n\nWhy a gap year before university might be a good idea\n\nOnly pack what you know you'll wear\n\nOn the same note, don\u2019t bring too many clothes. When I was packing, I kept throwing clothes I\u2019d never worn into my suitcase.\n\nI tried to justify it in my head by asking \"Yes, but what if \u2026 happens?\" Let\u2019s face it, you\u2019ll probably never find yourself in any of these hypothetical situations. So put that extra pair of trousers back in favour of sticking to the tried-and-true favourites you know you\u2019ll wear.\n\nKeep in mind that you have to bring it back The most important thing to remember is that you have to pack everything up again at the end of the year. It took me about a week, helped by several late nights and my roommate\u2019s insistence, to put all of my belongings in my two allocated boxes before room inspection - and I was one of the people who had my packing schedule reasonably under control. To sum it up: take only what\u2019s necessary. If you can imagine living your daily life without it, leave it at home and make space for something of greater importance (like more food!).\n\nAll GIFs via GIPHY", "description": "A guide to what to bring when you're going to study overseas, from someone who sorely misjudged things in her first year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/packing_.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
