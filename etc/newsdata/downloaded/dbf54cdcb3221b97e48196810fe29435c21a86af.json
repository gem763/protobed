Danielle \u2018Ivy\u2019 Lee told the court how she had been left upset after Scott called her a series of \u2018degrading names\u2019.\n\nShe has been sentenced to an 18 month good behaviour bond and ordered to pay Scott\u2019s medical costs. Scott, best known for playing Detective Mark Brennan for six years in soap, denied verbally attacking Danielle in the Gold Coast club. He sistained a small cut which required three stitches after she threw the glass at him.\n\nAddressing the court, Danielle explained at the trial: \u2018He said: \u201cF*** off you dirty s**t. You are a piece of s**t. I would never take someone as dirty as you\u201d. He said: \u201cI am better than that. I am better than you. F*** off\u201d.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a report in The Courier Mail, the 25-year-old exotic danger said she felt \u2018degraded\u2019 and insisted that she had only intended to throw the contents of the glass. She told the court: \u2018I was so furious that someone had abused me like that. I was so upset, hurt and angry, but I never meant to hurt anyone.\n\nDanielle Lee first attended court in August (Picture: AAP/Press Association)\n\n\u2018It was like the last straw for me. He just kept abusing me. It was not just once, it was not just twice, it was a few times. There\u2019s no need for it. I\u2019m not the type of person that would ever intentionally want to hurt somebody.\u2019\n\nMagistrate Mark Howden on Tuesday found Scott\u2019s evidence to be evasive, and that he had verbally insulted Danielle. But he also ruled that Danielle\u2019s response was \u2018disproportionate\u2019.\n\nHe found her guilty before releasing her on a $1000 good behaviour bond. No conviction was recorded and she was ordered to pay $80 for Scott\u2019s medical costs.\n\nScott will leave his role in the soap later this year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The incident happened after a fierce row.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PRI_80856718_1570541662.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
