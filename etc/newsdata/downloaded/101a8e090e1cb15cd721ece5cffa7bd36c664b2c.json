We will no longer open new accounts for prospective clients,\" it said in a statement.\n\nCharles Schwab had opened its Singapore office in late 2017 to provide greater access of the U.S. market to investors in Singapore and Asia, who are often underexposed due to high transaction fees.\n\nThe launch of the office had come after integration and account migration from optionsXpress, a derivatives trading platform that Charles Schwab acquired in 2011.\n\nThe company, which provides brokerage and financial advisory services, reported an 8% year-on-year jump in second-quarter net income at $937 million. As of July, it had total client assets of $3.75 trillion.\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on whether the step will lead to layoffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Rishika Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Rashmi Aich)", "description": "\"Charles Schwab Singapore will cease to provide services and will close its office in Singapore.
