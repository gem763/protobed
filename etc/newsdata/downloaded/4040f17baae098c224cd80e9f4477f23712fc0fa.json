Lets make a pledge to be kinder. If you have nothing nice to say just keep it in your mind and don\u2019t voice it.\"\n\nShe ended the clip: \"I think the world would be much kinder if that was the case, so be kind is my message today.\"\n\nIt came after earlier on in the day she shared pyjama-clad footage, where she put on a brave face about the horrible letter.\n\nActing unbothered, she shared: \"Can I just say I did not know this was a thing, I know trolls is a thing but I just received a letter in the post.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"Lets have a look, If anyone recognise this handwriting its from an a**hole.\n\n\"It is s****ing off google box which I haven\u2019t been in for three years - unless its got stuck in the post.\"\n\nShe then joked: \"The post can\u2019t take that long.\"\n\nSummarising what was written, the Geordie told: \" Erm just calling us fat really and apparently my mouth looks like a pork chop sliced in half.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nBefore adding: \"What else have they done they\u2019ve put a clip in from the paper.\n\n\"Thanks for that!

Turns out I'm not even safe from vile comments in the comfort of my own home.\n\n\"I WILL NOT let bullies like this get me down.
