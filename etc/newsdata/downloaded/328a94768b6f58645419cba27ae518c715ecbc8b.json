After eight fleet races involving all six teams, the competition will conclude with a $1 million, winner-take-all match race between the top two teams to determine the season champion.\n\nBarring a catastrophic accident, the Aussies and Team Japan, skippered by Australian Nathan Outteridge, are all but guaranteed a spot in the match race final after dominating the first four regattas.\n\nThe $1 million is a tremendous payout for a 10-minute race, and a serious motivator.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare for us to race for money,\u201d Slingsby said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd so, yeah, we usually do it for the glory but this time it\u2019s different.\u201d\n\nThe Australian and Japanese teams are skippered by two of the world\u2019s best sailors.\n\nSlingsby, an Olympic gold medalist who helped Oracle Team USA win the America\u2019s Cup in 2013, said the Aussies are \u201cobviously very driven\u201d by the huge cash prize. \u201cThat\u2019s the most money we\u2019ve ever sailed for. I\u2019ve basically never sailed for prize money in my life. I won 400 euros when I was 19 or 20, and that was everything. This is a big step up.\u201d\n\nHe said that prize was in a Laser class race in the Netherlands and it allowed him to stay in Europe for another regatta.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any money and needed some way to get to all these events,\u201d he said. \u201cFortunately, it got me through.\u201d\n\nThe only other million-dollar prize in sailing was in 2016 for the World Match Racing Tour championship. It was won by New Zealander Phil Robertson, the skipper of the Chinese SailGP team.\n\nAustralia leads Japan 169 points to 165. The U.S. is a distant third with 123 points, followed by Britain, China and France.\n\nSlingsby beat Outteridge in the match-race finals at the first two regattas, in Sydney and San Francisco. Outteridge, an Olympic gold and silver medalist as well as an America\u2019s Cup veteran, dominated the New York stop, including winning the match-race final against Slingsby. The last regatta, in Cowes, England, was shortened to one day because of bad weather, with the Australians winning all three fleet races.\n\nThe Aussies can\u2019t use their foiling F50 catamaran for the training camp, as all the boats are controlled by SailGP organizers. So they\u2019ll sail against a crew headed by young Aussie match racing star Harry Price in M-32 catamarans.\n\n\u201cObviously there\u2019s no boat in the world that can emulate the F50, but what we\u2019re sailing, they are fast for a nonfoiling boat and they\u2019re very good little match-racing boars,\u201d Slingsby said. \u201cThe big thing for us is to just brush up on our communication skills.\u201d\n\nSlingsby said he\u2019s been able to pry some extra training time for the Aussies in their F50 before Marseille.\n\n\u201cI feel really good,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like we sort of bounced back from a tough one. Now we\u2019re sort of back in the driver\u2019s seat. We know Nathan will come back strong. It will come down to last day and we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re in the right mindset and ready to roll.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Bernie Wilson on Twitter at https://twitter.com/berniewilson\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The allure of $1 million is worth extra time on the water for skipper Tom Slingsby and his Australian crew.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
