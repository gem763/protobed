The climate crisis won\u2019t wait, so neither will we,\u201d the description of the international strike reads.\n\nThe Global Climate Strike can trace its origins back to Thunberg\u2019s early days of activism, before the 16-year-old became the globally-renowned public figure that she is today.\n\nIn August 2018, Thunberg took part in a school strike which saw her stand in front of Swedish parliament for three weeks, holding a sign which read: \u201cSkolstrejk f\u00f6r klimatet\u201c (school strike for the climate).\n\nPhotographs of Thunberg\u2019s demonstration gained traction on social media, resulting in her becoming one of the most recognisable faces in the environmental movement and inspiring thousands of others to follow suit.\n\nIn March, hundreds of thousands of people took part in the Global Climate Strike for Future in more than 120 countries.\n\nA second Global Climate Strike was held in May, which Thunberg said was purposely organised in order to impact the European Parliament election, which was held from Thursday 23 May until Sunday 26 May.\n\nWhere are the strikes taking place?\n\nClimate strikes are being held in numerous regions around the world as part of the international event.\n\nIn order to find Global Climate Strike event near you, you can enter your city or country in the interactive map on this webpage.\n\n\u201cAlready people in 150 countries are organising for the global climate strikes this September,\u201d the Global Climate Strike website states.\n\nIn London, climate strikes are due to take place in areas including Millbank, Islington, Bethnal Green and Hammersmith.\n\nStrikes are also organised across the UK in cities including Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Bournemouth, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast and more.\n\nFurthermore, climate change activists will protest in countries including the United States, France, Australia, Germany, Japan and India.\n\n\u201cSome will spend the day in protest against new pipelines and mines, or the banks that fund them; some will highlight the oil companies fuelling this crisis and the politicians that enable them,\u201d Global Climate Strike states on its website.\n\n\u201cOthers will spend the day in action raising awareness in their communities and pushing for solutions to the climate crisis that have justice and equity at their heart.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Thunberg testified before the US Congress about climate change.\n\nRather than provide prepared comments, the activist submitted a copy of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s special report on global warming.\n\n\u201cI am submitting this report as my testimony because I don\u2019t want you to listen to me, I want you to listen to the scientists,\u201d she said during the hearing.\n\nThunberg is due to speak at the United Nations Climate Action Summit on Monday 23 September.", "description": "The Global Climate Strike begins soon, with environmental activist Greta Thunberg at the forefront of the international movement.
