To his credit, Smith (whose firm is paid $10,000 a month by Ready for Hillary) said he recognizes that \u201cif there is a campaign, it\u2019s got to be [made up of] people who know how to run a campaign of 2016.\u201d In an effort to step up its grass-roots organizing, Ready for Hillary has already signed up numerous 20-something newcomers. It has also brought on the consulting company 270 Strategies, run by political operatives, including Jeremy Bird and Mitch Stewart, who were largely credited with Obama\u2019s ground strategy in 2008 and 2012.\n\nWhere things get thorny, though, is that Priorities USA, the big-money group that helped get Obama elected, is situating itself as the dominant money-raiser in 2016. (Sean Sweeney, a founder of Priorities USA, says he supports Ready for Hillary\u2019s \u201cimportant\u201d mission.) In fact, two Obama operatives, Messina and Buffy Wicks, have already signed on to Priorities to turn it into a big-money behemoth devoted to a Clinton candidacy, and some Ready for Hillary supporters have accused Priorities of already trying to take credit for getting their candidate elected. (Never mind that the election is more than two years away and that there\u2019s technically no candidate yet.) Certainly Wicks and Messina offer something that the Clinton old guard doesn\u2019t \u2014 a link to the network of donors who supported Obama. But also crucial is the fact that neither has ever worked for the Clintons, which allows them to navigate the waters more easily. They don\u2019t carry the baggage, for instance, of other old friends who helped get Obama elected. David Axelrod, in particular, was approached by Solis Doyle as early as 2006 to join the Hillary campaign, and his decision to sign on with Obama was the first real signal that the Illinois senator might create a problem. Among Obama aides, there\u2019s a sense that Bill Clinton never quite forgave him. \u201cThe Clintons make you feel like you\u2019re part of their family; that\u2019s just who they are,\u201d says Brazile, whose neutrality during the 2008 Democratic primaries was seen by numerous Clinton hands as an act of betrayal. \u201cTry divorcing them. I did, and oh, my God, that\u2019s not easy. I felt like I had broken up with my best lover.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the rogue friends and former staff members who present potential problems. In the past, the Royal Council hasn\u2019t always gotten along so well with President Clinton\u2019s advisers, referred to sardonically by Hillary\u2019s staff members in White House as \u201cthe White Boys.\u201d The tensions have ebbed and flowed over the years but reached a low in 2007, when there was an early tug-of-war about how the campaign should utilize, and dote on, the former president. Recently, more existential differences have surfaced. People close to Bill Clinton have told me repeatedly that it irks them that Democrats don\u2019t talk about the dignified, slimmed-down, silver-haired former president with the same reverence Republicans give Ronald Reagan. According to those people, Bill Clinton, who is conscious of the demands of a presidential race and what another loss would do to his own legacy and philanthropic work, is deferential about whether his wife should run. When people shout at him that they\u2019re ready for Hillary, he simply responds with a \u201cThank you,\u201d rather than asking for their support as he did leading up to the 2008 campaign. (That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not curious. When Ready for Hillary held a seminar for donors at Le Parker Meridien hotel last fall to discuss what it would take to win in 2016, Bill Clinton personally checked in with an attendee to ask what was being discussed and who was there.)\n\nEfforts to cement Bill\u2019s legacy appear somewhat unaligned with Hillary\u2019s forward-looking team. (At a recent book party in New York, Bill started his speech by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not much for living in the past, but I do think it\u2019s worth going back to what we\u2019ve faced,\u201d and then proceeded to talk for 20 minutes about electoral politics and his career, dating to 1968.) Denizens of Hillaryland often express exasperation that even after successfully serving in the Senate and as secretary of state, their boss is still so closely identified with her husband. \u201cIt\u2019s my pet peeve when they\u2019re described as an entity,\u201d Geoffrey Garin, who stepped in as a chief strategist after Mark Penn\u2019s disastrous run in \u201908, told me. \u201cObviously they are married and do things together, but they are two separate people with two separate identities in political life.\u201d", "description": "The gravitational pull of a possible 2016 campaign is bringing all the old Clinton characters into her orbit.
