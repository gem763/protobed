But it flipped and I got hot and made a bunch of putts.\"\n\nThe 43-year-old ended his 10-year major drought in April when he won a fifth Masters\n\nWoods lines up a putt on the 11th green.\n\nWoods, who warmed up in Japan with a made-for-TV exhibition match against Rory McIIroy, Jason Day and Hideki Matsuyama last weekend, is reaping the rewards of arthroscopic surgery on his knee.\n\n\"I was trying to make compensations,\" said the world No. 10, who had spine fusion surgery in 2017. \"Unfortunately, with the lack of movement that I had in my knee, my back took it and that's the last place I want to feel it.\n\n\"So, it was nice to be able to feel that I'm able to rotate a little bit better, able to clear better, and more importantly, be able to squat down and read putts.\n\n\"I was able to get down there today, which I've been doing at home, and that's something that if you look at the video towards the end of the season, I wasn't able to do very well.\"\n\nLocal favorite Matsuyama finished a shot off the lead, with world No. 2 McIlroy eight strokes adrift after a 72 at Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club in Chiba.\n\nWoods hits out of a bunker on the 11th hole.\n\nWith bad weather scheduled for Friday, the tee times for the second round have been moved forward an hour, but play could still be disrupted.\n\n\"It's going to be sloppy and tough for us tomorrow morning before the storm gets in and I think we're probably going to get a little bit wet while we're playing out there tomorrow and then it's going to be a grind on the weekend,\" Woods said.\n\n\"Hopefully I can keep it going.\"", "description": "Tiger Woods recovered from an \"ugly\" start to finish with a share of the lead after the opening round of the inaugural Zozo Championship in Japan Thursday.", "authors": ["Ben Morse"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191024103137-tiger-woods-zozo-championship-2-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
