But it\u2019s a good catch by Tommy Christopher at Mediaite nonetheless. Watch the beginning of the clip below, which was recorded in 2011, and you\u2019ll find her giving a mundane explanation for why she changed her focus early in life from teaching to law. Her husband had been transferred to New Jersey, she had always been told in high school that she was a good debater, she noticed there was a law school nearby in Newark, and after giving it a look she thought, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nNo mention there of her being unceremoniously tossed out of her teaching job for the crime of being pregnant, although obviously she\u2019s telling a truncated version of what happened. She does refer in passing at one point to \u201ca whole series of quick events\u201d that occurred between the time she shifted from teaching to law. Could one of those events have been sex discrimination by the school board on account of pregnancy, with Warren simply neglecting to specify it? She *has* said in recent years that she didn\u2019t begin opening up about personal things in interviews until much later in life.\n\nBut watch later in the clip (at 7:38). She talks about graduating from law school when she was nine months pregnant and says, \u201cI thought I\u2019d stepped off the train. You know, hard enough to get a job for a woman then, I was about to have a baby and nobody was interested in me.\u201d If discrimination based on pregnancy was part of her professional journey in law and she was willing to say so, you would think she also might have mentioned at some point in the clip that she\u2019d already experienced that type of discrimination once before. E.g., \u201cIn fact, one of the reasons I left teaching was because the school board that gave me my first job fired me for being pregnant, then dressed it up in the official record as a \u2018resignation.\u2019 Now here I was again as a law-school graduate facing the same cold shoulder.\u201d\n\nIf she was willing to talk about pregnancy\u2019s effect on her legal job prospects, why omit the detail about its effect on her educational job prospects? Unless, as Christopher says, there was no discrimination to account for why she left her teaching job. Maybe her original story about why she left it, concluding that \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me\u201d after taking a few graduate classes in education, was the true one after all.\n\nBut maybe this clip is also her way out of this mess. If she wants to showcase her personal experience with sex discrimination, she can always point back to what she said here about having trouble finding a job in law due to pregnancy. It\u2019s perfectly plausible given the times, and it\u2019d be hard for Republicans to disprove it given that she doesn\u2019t accuse any particular entity of discrimination like she did in the case of her teaching job. Her point is that the bias against women was industry-wide. That\u2019s enough to substantiate a relatable \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with this problem myself\u201d anecdote for voters.\n\nBut you know how Warren is with biographical details \u2014 why take an inch when you can try to take a mile?\n\nAnyway, the media is irritated that she\u2019s being challenged about this, partly because she\u2019s their preferred candidate and partly because there\u2019s a Larger Truth to it about how women of her generation were treated. They\u2019ll do what they can next year to dismiss it on her behalf. It\u2019s not like Trump is going to spend much time on it either. For him, it\u2019s \u201cPocahontas\u201d or bust in Warren biographical attacks.", "description": "Narratives.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ew-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
