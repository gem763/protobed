An estimated 2,000 more healers, or mgangas, are hoping to register, says Hassan Combo, the government registrar at the council that records them.\n\nMgangas must be aged at least 18, have at least three years of experience and have a recommendation letter from a trained mganga. A council of 11 members that can include birth attendants, respected healers, village elders and lawyers approve applications each month.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Doctors are linked up with traditional healers to give them some medical education on diseases like hypertension, diabetes and pregnancy while the mgangas share information about patient statistics and needs.\n\nSome healers use herbs. Others use scriptures from the Muslim holy book, the Koran. Most use both. Belief in supernatural spirits like djinns features strongly.\n\nFatawi Haji Hafidh, manager at Makunduchi Hospital, the second largest government-run hospital on Zanzibar\u2019s main island, says overstretched doctors and nurses may not have the time to see patients or the diagnostic equipment.\n\nPatients may also be unable to afford the medicine prescribed or they may stop taking it before the course is finished, leading them to relapse and adding to their suspicion of government-run facilities, he said.\n\nMany simply believe djinns are the problem.\n\nWriting by Katharine Houreld\n\nReuters", "description": "Zanzibar\u2019s\u00a0traditional healers, with their toolkits of herbs, holy scriptures and massages are being registered by authorities keen to regulate the practitioners who treat everything from depression to hernias.", "authors": ["Nicky Moran Woo"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/25/15/Zanzibar-traditional-healers-11.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
