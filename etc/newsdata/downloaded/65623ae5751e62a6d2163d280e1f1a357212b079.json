Pictured, an artist's impression of the newly-discovered world\n\nLead author Juan Carlos Morales of the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia said the planet may be almost as big as its host star. A year there lasts about 200 days.\n\n'It was very exciting finding this planet because it was completely unexpected,' Dr Morales wrote in an email, adding that the results indicate that 'a new population of massive planets may also exist around low-mass stars.'\n\nDr Morales and his team propose that gravitational instabilities in a young star's disk of gas and dust could, in some cases, cause the rapid formation of huge gas giant planets \u2014 even when their host star itself is minuscule.\n\nThis new world is 'an extraordinary candidate' for this process, said paper author Hubert Klahr of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany.\n\n'This find prompts us to review our models.'\n\nMore than 4,000 so-called 'exoplanets' have been detected in star systems outside our own, noted Yale University astronomer Greg Laughlin, who was not involved in the present research.\n\nBy itself, the detection of another new exoplanet would no longer be noteworthy, he said.\n\nHowever, he added, 'one that challenges current theories of planet formation can animate astronomers.'\n\n'It's exciting because we've wondered for long a time whether giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn can form around such small stars,' astrophysicist Peter Wheatley of the University of Warwick, who was not involved in the study, told the BBC.\n\n'I think the general impression had been that these planets just didn't exist, but we couldn't be sure because small stars are very faint, which makes them difficult to study, even though they are much more common than stars like the Sun.'\n\n'Usually we think of giant planets starting life as an icy-core, orbiting far out in a disc of gas surrounding the young star, and then growing rapidly by attracting gas on to itself.'\n\n'But the authors argue that the discs around small stars don't provide enough material for this to work.'\n\n'Instead, they consider it more likely that the planet formed suddenly when part of the disc collapsed due to its own gravity.'\n\nAstronomers reported Thursday they've found a Jupiter-like planet orbiting a star that's a mere 12 per cent the mass of our sun. Pictured, the Calar Alto Observatory in southern Spain which was used to detect the planet's presence based on the telltale wobble of its host star\n\nThe planet \u2014 which is at least half the mass of Jupiter \u2014 is orbiting a particularly small and cool red dwarf star which researchers have dubbed GJ 3512.\n\nScientists are unable to measure the planet's exact dimensions, but models indicate that it may be comparable in size to Jupiter, Morales said.\n\nFrom the Calar Alto Observatory in southern Spain, researchers repeatedly studied the star's wobbling motion that belies the presence of the planet moving along its lopsided orbit.\n\nThis approach was different to the traditional transit-based method, in which exoplanets spotted as they pass in front of their host and cause it's light to temporarily dim.\n\nThe star is so faint it was almost excluded from the group's survey \u2014 however, the experts needed more small stars for sampling and so added a few at the last minute.\n\n'We were lucky to do so because otherwise we would have never made this discovery,' said Catalonia space studies institute director Ignasi Ribas in a statement.\n\nWith their initial study complete, Dr Morales and colleagues are continuing to search for a second planet in this dwarf star system.\n\nThere may even have been a third planet, one was ejected from the system long ago, they added.\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal Science.", "description": "Lead author Juan Carlos Morales of the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia said the mysterious planet may be almost as big as its star and arose straight from gas without a solid core.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/27/18/19020346-0-image-a-14_1569606548368.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
