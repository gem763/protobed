As you can hear, her remarks were full of \"how dare yous.\"\n\n\u201dPeople are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth.\u201d Watch Greta Thunberg speak at the UN Monday morning. https://t.co/Akkxm9sXdr pic.twitter.com/ahHKlhbYaE \u2014 WIRED (@WIRED) September 23, 2019\n\nPresident Trump, who will deliver his own speech at the UNGA on Tuesday morning, offered what seemed to be a sarcastic message for the young Swedish environmental activist.\n\nShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see! https://t.co/1tQG6QcVKO \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nLiberal outrage ensued because Trump clearly seemed to be mocking the teenager. But, that's when the word \"Covington\" started trending on Twitter. That's because conservatives remember how just last year the media painted Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann as a monster after someone posted a photo of him on Twitter smirking at a Native American veteran in Washington, D.C. We didn't have all the context, but the Twitter mob saw the young man's Make America Great Again hat and reached their own conclusions. When more details surfaced we learned that it was actually the veteran who started the confrontation.\n\nDon't forget: Little Greta is the same age as Nick Sandmann (the Covington Highschool boy who was smeared). THE MORE YOU KNOW! \u2014 Steven Crowder (@scrowder) September 24, 2019\n\nThe mainstream media today: \"How dare you mock Greta Thunberg! She's just a child!\"\n\n\n\nThe mainstream media earlier this year: \"How dare you protect those boys at Covington Catholic! It doesn't matter that they're kids!\"\n\n\n\nSame people. \u2014 Emerald Robinson ?? (@EmeraldRobinson) September 24, 2019\n\nProgressives, however, argue the two don't compare.\n\nWhen the Covington kids start giving speeches to the un about saving the planet we can start comparing them. https://t.co/M57hKczOQ0 \u2014 Molly Jong-Fast (@MollyJongFast) September 24, 2019\n\nWhile this debate ensues, please enjoy this clip of Trump walking past Thunberg at the UNGA as she sends a thousand eye daggers his way. For reasons I don't have to explain, it went viral.", "description": ".09/24/2019 11:12:54AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Timothy Meads", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/266/3115462b-d7c3-4c87-83c8-1044acc882e2.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
