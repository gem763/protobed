Chuck Grassley hopes voters \"remember Kavanaugh.\" Brian Powers, bpowers@dmreg.com\n\nThe U.S. House Judiciary Committee has, appropriately, opened an investigation into Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation last year, in the wake of evidence of a previously undisclosed allegation of sexual misconduct against him involving his college days. That information was reported over the weekend by New York Times reporters who found in the course of writing a book about Kavanaugh that the FBI was made aware of the incident before Kavanaugh's confirmation, but didn't investigate it.\n\nAt least six Democratic presidential candidates are calling for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment for lying on the witness stand. It's hard to imagine that happening under the current Republican-led Senate, whose majority continues to back the Trump presidency no matter what. Trump now tweets that Kavanaugh is the one being assaulted by fake news and lies about him, and should sue.\n\nThis undated photo provided by Safehouse Progressive Alliance for Nonviolence shows Deborah Ramirez. Ramirez went public with allegations that while in his first year at Yale University, Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh placed his penis in front of her and caused her to involuntarily touch it during a drunken dormitory party. Kavanaugh denied the accusation soon after it was reported Sunday, Sept. 23, 2018, by The New Yorker magazine.

Iowa's senior senator, Charles Grassley, also has some answering to do for why he rushed the Kavanaugh confirmation process through without properly vetting the nominee\u2019s past conduct toward women. Christine Blasey Ford, who was in high school when, she told the committee, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed at a party, groped her and tried to take off her clothes while covering her mouth. She said she feared he would unintentionally kill her.\n\n\u201cUltimately, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, concluded, \u2018There is no corroboration of the allegations made by Dr. Ford or Ms. Ramirez,\u2019 \" wrote the Times reporters. \"Mr. Kavanaugh was confirmed on Oct. 6, 2018, by a vote of 50-48, the closest vote for a Supreme Court justice in more than 130 years.\u201d\n\nGrassley stopped chairing the committee in January.\n\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, right, shakes hands with Sen.

(Photo: Susan Walsh, AP)\n\nThe latest Times piece centers on Deborah Ramirez, who was a Yale freshman at the same time as Kavanaugh in the early '80s and attended a drunken dorm party with some classmates at which he reportedly pulled down his pants and shoved his penis at her. In her attempt to push it away, the story said, she inadvertently touched it. But the previously untold story involved another dorm party and another unnamed woman who reportedly doesn't recall the incident in which friends allegedly pushed Kavanaugh\u2019s penis into her hand. The writers said they corroborated it with two officials. Former classmate Max Stier later reported it to the FBI and senators but wasn't contacted.\n\nThe FBI's failure to investigate either incident fully and the Senate Judiciary's drive to stop seeking the complete information are inexcusable. In Ramirez\u2019s case, the FBI was given at least 25 names of people who could potentially corroborate, and many tried unsuccessfully to contact the bureau themselves. But the agency didn't interview any. That's even though two FBI agents who interviewed Ramirez told her they found her \u201ccredible,\u201d but needed authorization to go any further, according to the Times.\n\nAnd now it turns out Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware also had written FBI Director Christopher Wray during that time saying he had relevant information about Kavanaugh, but no one followed up with him. Coons wrote that several people had approached him with different allegations against Kavanaugh than those involving Blasey Ford, one of whom might have corroborated Ramirez's account.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee's summary report said investigators spoke to 45 people and took 25 written statements relating to the various allegations, but \"In neither the Committee\u2019s investigation nor in the supplemental background investigation conducted by the FBI was there any evidence to substantiate or corroborate any of the allegations.\"\n\nIn fact, Grassley's committee report suggests Blasey Ford's tearful recollections were a needless and irritating distraction for a committee hell-bent on ramming through the president's nominee regardless. \"Despite the Committee\u2019s best efforts to ensure a timely and thorough review,\" it said, \"an eleventh hour news report released the day before a scheduled Committee vote on Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination disrupted the Senate\u2019s exhaustive confirmation process.\"\n\n\u201cThe revelation of last minute allegations tested the committee in many ways,\" it said. \"But these investigative efforts rose to the occasion and were critical to helping us obtain the truth. This was a serious and thorough investigation that left no stone unturned in our pursuit of the facts.\u201d\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and committee member, disagreed. \u201cI would view the Ramirez allegations as not having been even remotely investigated,\u201d he said in the Times piece.\n\nGrassley Spokesman Michael Zona said in an email that the senator never directed how the FBI should conduct its investigation, and had requested a supplemental background investigation following a bipartisan request from committee members. The resulting report, like the committee\u2019s own investigation, didn't substantiate any claims against Kavanaugh, he said: \"Every allegation Sen. Grassley received was investigated and none were corroborated.\" Zona also said Democrats on the committee \"issued no report and identified no evidence to substantiate these claims.\"\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, the California Democrat on the Judiciary committee now seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, wrote of Kavanaugh in a tweet calling for his impeachment: \"He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice.\"\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, joined the call, tweeting Kavanaugh's nomination \"was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him.\"\n\nOther Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former H.U.D. Secretary Julian Castro and former Texas U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke have made similar calls. O'Rourke alleged the FBI was pressured by the Senate and not given the time to perform its due diligence.\n\nFaced with multiple credible allegations of abusive behavior toward women by their nominee to the nation's top court, the Senate's Republican majority chose to put party allegiance first, behaving as if this were a mere Democratic ploy to derail Kavanaugh. But this was a vetting process and when a man is credibly accused of using force or intimidation against a woman, drunk or not, it tells you he's unfit to lead. Every bit of evidence should have been sought and unearthed before Kavanaugh's nomination was voted on. Grassley let us down by not doing so. Now, let's let the whole truth come out.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/rekha-basu/2019/09/17/grassley-put-politics-above-regard-women-kavanaugh-hearing/2350417001/", "description": "As Judiciary Committee chair, Iowa Sen.
