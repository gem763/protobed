Legend not a strong enough word for El Mago'.\n\nOthers replied to Silva's photo with, 'What a truly lovely picture legend' and 'Beautiful family photo'.\n\nThe Manchester City star has had some tough, family related matters in recent times after his son was born prematurely by five months back in 2018.\n\nHis son's condition saw the Spaniard take some time away from football to be with his family and he received overwhelming support from his club, their fans and the footballing world - a factor that makes this photo all the more sweeter and poignant.\n\nThe central midfielder has got some time off during the International break after retiring from Spain last year. He will return to Manchester soon as City prepare to bounce back in the Premier League from their shock 2-0 defeat to Wolves.", "description": "The midfielder posed for a photo with his grandparents and son in his hometown of Gran Canaria.
