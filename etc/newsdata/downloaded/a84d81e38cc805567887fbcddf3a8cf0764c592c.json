This they have failed to do so far.\u201d\n\nSky News said on Sunday night that analysis commissioned by the DfT suggested that on the first day of a no-deal Brexit, the worst-case scenario would be a two-day maximum delay for freight and vehicles at Dover, and an average wait of a day-and-a-half.\n\nMcKenzie said any delay at the ports would cause a \u201cvery, very substantial traffic jam\u201d, adding: \u201cWhat we are saying is that we urgently need clarity from this government, having not had it from the previous government, we urgently need clarity from this government of what traders have to do to get ready for a no-deal Brexit.\u201d\n\nHouse prices could nosedive after no-deal Brexit, says KPMG Read more\n\nOn 7 August, the RHA was among organisations meeting Michael Gove, who is in charge of planning for no deal, plus the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, in Dover to discuss preparations for Brexit at the border.\n\nHe said there have been \u201ccountless\u201d meetings with both the current and previous government. \u201cWhat we need is action, and we need action now. And there\u2019s this gap between what they say they\u2019re going to do and what they have so far failed to deliver.\u201d\n\nKevin Green of the Freight Transport Association \u2013 which speaks for the logistics industry \u2013 said he was concerned that there was \u201cstill much which the sector needs clarification on in order to ensure that Britain keeps trading after Brexit\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe sector is flexible and agile but needs to know what it is preparing for \u2013 and today\u2019s report shows that there is still much that is uncertain. With so little time left, logistics businesses need the support of government to ensure that the UK\u2019s interconnected supply chain is protected after the UK leaves the EU.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "\u2018Clear and present danger\u2019 to supply chain, say hauliers, with no sign of new customs process", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2583df5ad79ddb7c935ff72e8919bfe3afca7213/0_138_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4209b5051eb9ca5b0046b416adbdc9e1"}
