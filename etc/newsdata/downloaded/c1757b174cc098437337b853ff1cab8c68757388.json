REUTERS/Omar Sobhani\n\nRepresentative Eliot Engel, the committee\u2019s Democratic chairman, said he signed the subpoena after the U.S. State Department ignored numerous requests for briefings by Khalilzad about the Afghanistan peace plan and the administration\u2019s path forward in the country.\n\nEngel released a letter last week expressing frustration with the administration\u2019s failure to arrange briefings by Khalilzad. He said the State Department had refused requests in February, April and earlier this month for briefings or testimony.\n\n\u201cMore than 2,000 American troops have died in Afghanistan, and I\u2019m fed up with this Administration keeping Congress and the American people in the dark on the peace process and how we\u2019re going to bring this long war to a close,\u201d Engel said in a statement.\n\n\u201cFor months, we haven\u2019t been able to get answers on the Afghanistan peace plan, and now the President is saying the plan is dead. We need to hear directly from the Administration\u2019s point person on Afghanistan to understand how this process went off the rails. I expect to see Ambassador Khalilzad in our hearing room next Thursday at 10 o\u2019clock sharp,\u201d Engel said.\n\nThe State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the subpoena.\n\nTrump proclaimed negotiations with Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban leaders dead on Monday after scrapping talks with the group planned for Camp David, Maryland, during the weekend after a U.S. soldier was killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul.\n\nThe abrupt announcement - and news that Trump had planned to bring Taliban leaders to the American presidential retreat - angered many in Congress.\n\nBringing U.S. troops home from Afghanistan has been one of Trump\u2019s main foreign policy objectives, and the Republican president said his administration was still thinking about a drawdown of the 14,000 U.S. soldiers in the country.\n\nIt was the first subpoena issued by the committee since Democrats took control of the House in January and Engel became chairman.", "description": "The U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee said on Thursday it will subpoena President Donald Trump's special Afghanistan envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, to testify on Sept. 19, after the abrupt cancellation of talks with the country's Taliban militia.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429257681&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1YY"}
