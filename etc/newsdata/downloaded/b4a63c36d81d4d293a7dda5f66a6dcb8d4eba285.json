In the \u201cmemorandum\u201d, Trump responds to Zelensky's request to purchase more of the Javelin missiles his military uses to defend against Russian tanks by asking for \"a favor.\" Later in the conversation, Trump asks Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani, his personal attorney, and Attorney General William Barr to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

While it reads at some points like a complete record of the conversation, a \"CAUTION\" note on the first page explains that it merely \"records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place.\"\n\nThe document even contains three ellipses, used to denote gaps in the record of the conversation, all at points when Trump is making requests of Zelensky. There does not appear to be any record of what Trump asked for in full.\n\nThe lack of a transcript is a clear departure from how previous presidents' calls with foreign leaders were documented. According to one former National Security Council official administration, presidential phone calls have long been \"routinely transcribed\" by NSC staff.\n\nIt's not only a clear departure from how things were done in past administrations: it's a departure from the practices in place when Trump took office.\n\nHis calls with foreign leaders were transcribed in full until at least August 2017, when the Washington Post published transcripts of two awkward calls between Trump and the leaders of Australia and Mexico, respectively. But it appears that Trump \u2014 or someone within the administration looking to protect him \u2014 put the kibosh on such an accurate record of his words not long after.\n\nAccording to former White House stenographer Beck Dorey-Stein, that's how he likes it.\n\n\"It's much easier to muddle the truth when you don't have a transcript,\" Dorey-Stein told NPR last July.\n\nTrump's aversion to record keeping \u2014 and the accountability it brings \u2014 actually goes even further. While the Presidential Records Act requires that all paperwork touched by the President be preserved for posterity, Trump's habit while in office has been to tear up papers when he is done with them. Not only is such a practice illegal, but it made life miserable for the Executive Office of the President's career records management staff.\n\n\u201cIt was the craziest thing ever. He ripped papers into tiny pieces,\" former records management analyst Solomon Larty told Politico after he and a colleague were fired without explanation.\n\nTrump's dislike of documentation seems to have even extended to his own attorneys.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Why do you take notes? Lawyers don't take notes. I never had a lawyer who took notes.\"\n\nAccording to Mueller, McGahn responded that he kept notes because he was a \"real lawyer,\" and explained that notes which create a record are not a bad thing.\n\nTrump responded: \"I've had a lot of great lawyers, like Roy Cohn. He did not take notes.\"\n\nCohn, the non-note-taker who rose to prominence as the late Joseph McCarthy's attack dog, was disbarred in 1986 amid allegations that he'd manipulated a client into amending his will and that he'd misappropriated client funds. Despite his best efforts, enough documentation of his unethical conduct existed to seal Cohn's fate, ending his legal career.\n\nWith House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's recent endorsement of impeachment proceedings, it's possible that what limited records have survived in spite of Trump's aversion to them might seal his as well.", "description": "As Yogi Berra once said, it's deja vu all over again.
