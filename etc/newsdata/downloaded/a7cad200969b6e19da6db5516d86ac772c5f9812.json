That left-ward movement is somewhat strange, since tropical cyclones passing through the same location typically re-curve to the right.\n\nThough hurricane models have improved over the last several decades, forecasters are still working to learn about how hurricanes form and intensify.\n\nTo answer these fundamental questions, they turn to data from places like University of Miami's Sustain Laboratory, where a $15 million machine can mimic the conditions of a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nBrian Haus, the director of the laboratory, told Business Insider how he's using the tank to help forecasters make better predictions about storms like Hurricane Dorian in the future.", "description": "The acrylic tank uses a wind tunnel and wave basin to mimic the oceanic and atmospheric conditions that combine to form a hurricane.", "authors": ["Aria Bendix"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6999962e22af50a0349713-2732-1366.jpg"}
