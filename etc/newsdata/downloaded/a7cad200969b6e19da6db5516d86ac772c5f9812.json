Here's what the hurricane tank looks like.", "description": "The acrylic tank uses a wind tunnel and wave basin to mimic the oceanic and atmospheric conditions that combine to form a hurricane.", "authors": ["Aria Bendix"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6999962e22af50a0349713-2732-1366.jpg"}
