Nine of the bags were determined to hold 22 pounds of fentanyl and three others held 2.64 pounds of cocaine. The combined value of the fentanyl and cocaine was determined to have an estimated street worth of $236,400, according to a federal media release.\n\nThe driver was arrested and turned over to the DEA for a determination of charges.
