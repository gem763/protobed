All is forgiven!", "language": "en", "text": "If you\u2019ve been paying attention since Trump was elected on Nov. 8, 2016, you surely know by now that you were dead wrong about him. This is a president for the times we live in. Try to imagine the founding of our nation without George Washington to steady it. Try to picture the outcome of the secession of the Southern states without Abraham Lincoln there to stand against it. Think of the Apollo moon shot without John Kennedy to launch it.\n\nNow think of the war against the Fake News Media without Donald Trump to fight it. Think of the Supreme Court without Trump\u2019s conservative appointments to balance it. Think of the economy without the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts or its war on restrictive regulations. Think of the wasted billions of dollars if Trump had not pulled the United States out of the idiotic Paris climate accords. Think of the porous border without at least the promise of a wall. Think of the FBI still being run by corrupt James Comey and Andrew McCabe.\n\nOr just look at what has transpired in the past two weeks, and ask yourself how you could ever allow a Democrat back in the White House rather than vigorously support the reelection of Donald Trump.", "description": "", "authors": ["Frank Miele", "Realclearpolitics.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
