According to The MDC, alternative methods include throwlines, trotlines, limb lines, bank lines, jug lines, spearfishing, snagging, snaring, gigging, grabbing, archery and atlatl (a spear-throwing device).\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBabler's biggest brown trout prior to Wednesday\u2019s catch reportedly weighed 13 pounds.
