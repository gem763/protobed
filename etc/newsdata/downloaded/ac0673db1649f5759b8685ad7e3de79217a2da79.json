The 14-month-old Maine Coon absolutely loves venturing outside the house, joining his owner for everything from a three-day biking tour through the Canadian Rockies to a paddleboarding trip (he wore his own life jacket, don\u2019t worry).\n\nOwner Michelle Gagnon, 50, has been teaching Bodhi all sorts of adrenaline-packed pursuits for the last ten months.\n\nMichelle, a retired hiking guide, of Canmore, Canada, said: \u2018An adventure cat is a term I made up 18 years ago when I got my old cat Bugaboo.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018An adventure cat comes along with you on adventures whether that means he\u2019s sitting in a bike basket or walking alongside you or sitting on your shoulders.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTraining a kitty to become an adventure cat takes time, effort, and patience.\n\nThankfully Bodhi is a bit of a natural, but he still required some help from Michelle.\n\nShe said: \u2018Cats have this real desire to keep themselves safe and they have a very high instinctual survival mode.\n\nBodhi loves going for hikes (Picture: Michelle Gagnon / SWNS)\n\n\u2018They have to be in control of everything and training a cat is about getting them used to everything outside, like wide open spaces and walking on sidewalks.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m putting in lots of hours in training and getting Bodhi to walk as much as possible.\n\n\u2018He is now way better with wide open spaces and walking on a trail and understanding that wildlife moves around him.\u2019\n\nMichelle got Bodhi in December last year and immediately began taking him cross-country skiing.\n\nHe also enjoys paddleboarding (Picture: Michelle Gagnon / SWNS)\n\nHe walked behind her in the snow then curled up on Michelle\u2019s shoulders as she skied down.\n\nMichelle\u2019s shoulders are a \u2018safe spot\u2019 for Bodhi, so he knows he can always climb up there if he gets tired on a hike.\n\nHe\u2019s keen to try anything new and thrives on adventure.\n\n\u2018He has done stand up paddleboarding,\u2019 says Michelle. \u2018He wears a little life jacket when he\u2019s on his paddleboard.\n\n\u2018He has gone a couple of big bike tours and we have biked some of the most scenic roads of the Canadian Rockies.\n\nMichelle thinks of Bodhi as her child (Picture: Michelle Gagnon / SWNS\n\n\u2018One was two-days long and the other was three-days long. I made him a special basket for the front of my bike. We did 100km a day.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir joint adventures mean Bodhi and Michelle have a special bond.\n\n\u2018Bugaboo was definitely my baby and when he died last November, I felt like I had lost a child,\u2019 she says. \u2018Now Bodhi is like my next child.\n\n\u2018I want him to have positive experiences on all of our adventures and build his confidence. You have to make it interesting for them.\n\n\u2018I try not to use treats as then they just want more treats. I try to use a lot of positive encouragement.\u2019\n\nMORE: Cat abandoned with heartbreaking note saying owners \u2018can\u2019t afford\u2019 him anymore\n\nMORE: How to wake up when it\u2019s dark outside\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Bodhi joins Michelle for everything from massive hikes to paddleboarding.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90258000_1571313953.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
