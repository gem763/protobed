Lindsey Graham (R-SC) was asked whether he supported the president\u2019s move, prompting the hawkish Republican lawmaker to exclaim, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t see Donald Trump\u2019s name on the tweet, I thought it would be [former President] Obama\u2019s rationale for getting out of Iraq.\u201d he said. \u201cThis is gonna lead to ISIS\u2019s reemergence!\u201d\n\nGraham went on to say this was a \u201cbig win for ISIS,\u201d claiming that the Kurds in the area will align with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad because they\u2019d have no choice due to the United States abandoning them. \u201cSo this is a big win for Iran and Assad,\u201d he added.\n\n(During another Fox & Friends segment, co-host Brian Kilmeade criticized the president as well, calling the president\u2019s decision \u201cdisastrous\u201d and that it would leave the Kurds to fend for themselves.)\n\nThe South Carolina senator then stated that the \u201cKurds stepped up when nobody else would to fight ISIS,\u201d noting that if we abandon the Kurds at this point, nobody will want to help America in the future in fighting radical Islam. Graham also pushed back on Trump\u2019s claim that ISIS has been eradicated.\n\n\u201cThe biggest lie being told by the administration [is] that ISIS is defeated,\u201d he declared. \u201cThis impulsive decision by the president has undone all the gains we\u2019ve made, thrown the region into further chaos. Iran is licking their chops. And if I\u2019m an ISIS fighter, I\u2019ve got a second lease on life. So to those who think ISIS has been defeated, you will soon see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m making myself clear how shortsighted and irresponsible this decision is, in my view,\u201d Graham concluded.\n\nThe GOP lawmaker continued to blast the president\u2019s move on Twitter following his Fox & Friends appearance, saying he doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve it is a good idea to outsource the fight against ISIS to Russia, Iran and Turkey.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel very bad for the Americans and allies who have sacrificed to destroy the ISIS Caliphate because this decision virtually reassures the reemergence of ISIS. So sad. So dangerous,\u201d he wrote in another tweet. \u201cPresident Trump may be tired of fighting radical Islam. They are NOT tired of fighting us.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, piggybacking off his assertion on Fox & Friends that he would do everything he can to sanction Turkey if they invade Syria, Graham announced that he would \u201cintroduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if they invade Syria and will call for their suspension from NATO if they attack Kurdish forces who assisted the U.S. in the destruction of the ISIS Caliphate.\u201d\n\nGraham wasn\u2019t alone among Trump\u2019s allies and loyalists to call out the president over his decision to stand aside as Turkey attacks one of America\u2019s most reliable allies in the region. For example, Nikki Haley, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said we \u201cmust always have the backs of our allies\u201d and leaving the Kurds to \u201cdie is a big mistake.\u201d And Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), weeks after competing with Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) for Trump\u2019s affections, called it a \u201ccatastrophic mistake\u201d to pull out of Syria, adding that terrorists \u201cthousands of miles away can and will use their safe-havens to launch attacks against America.\u201d\n\nFacing overwhelming criticism from within his own party on the Turkey-Syria decision, Trump tweeted late Monday morning that if Turkey does anything that \u201cI, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!).\u201d", "description": "\u201cI hope I\u2019m making myself clear how shortsighted and irresponsible this decision is, in my view,\u201d one of the president\u2019s biggest allies said Monday.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3016,w_5361,x_0,y_1/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570463721/RTS2EUAS_mdgrua", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
