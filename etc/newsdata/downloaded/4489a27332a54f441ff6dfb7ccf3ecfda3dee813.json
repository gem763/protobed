General Assembly this week, some saw Donald Trump as the Leader of the Free World. Others said, no, he was there as the leader of the Nationalist International.\n\nA September 22 rally in Houston lent support to the latter viewpoint. Before a cheering throng of 50,000, Trump shared a stage with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose Bharatiya Janata Party might be described as Trumpian\u2014were it not for the fact that the BJP preceded Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d movement by decades.\n\nTogether, Trump and Modi hammered their favorite themes. Connecting his concern about the security of the U.S. border with Mexico to India\u2019s concern about its border with Pakistan, Trump proclaimed, \u201cBoth India and the U.S. also understand that to keep our communities safe, we must protect our borders.\u201d\n\nEyeing his own re-election bid, the president added, \u201cWe are going to take care of our Indian-American citizens before we take care of illegal immigrants that want to pour into our country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor his part, Modi was effusive toward his presidential host. The Indian leader lauded Trump\u2019s \u201cconcern for every American, a belief in America\u2019s future, and a strong resolve to make America great again.\u201d And speaking of \u201cmy friend\u201d Trump, he modified the Hindi words of his own BJP slogan for the USA: \u201cAbki baar, Trump sarkar\u201d\u2014\u201cThis time, a Trump country.\u201d\n\nIt was, in fact, a heady day in Houston. Politico described it under the headline, \u201cAt a rally like no other, Trump woos Indian American voters ahead of 2020: The president tried to appeal to the growing political force at a huge \u2018Howdy, Modi\u2019 event with India\u2019s popular leader.\u201d As the article observed, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your typical Trump campaign rally. Instead of red Make America Great Again hats, there were turbans and Islamic caps. Women in traditional Indian garb danced to drums. And tens of thousands of cheering Indian Americans chanted \u2018USA!\u2019 and snapped photos.\u201d\n\nThus we are reminded that nationalist and religious display is, for lack of a better word, fun. That is, it\u2019s fun, as well as both rooted and meaningful, to dress up in ethnic or tribal garb. To be sure, ethnicity is not the only motive for exuberant expression\u2014sports fans, for example, demonstrate a related impulse\u2014yet pride of origin is as enduring as anything in human nature.\n\nTo be sure, not everyone loves Trump, and not everyone loves Modi. He has long been a controversial figure in India, we well as in the U.S. In fact, in 2005, the U.S. government banned Modi, then a provincial minister, from entering this country over concerns that he had turned a blind eye toward human rights in his country. (Yes, those were the days when the Bush administration was dedicated to human rights everywhere\u2014so much so that it preemptively invaded a sovereign country, Iraq, to bring to it the blessings of democracy.)\n\nStill, even without the Bush blessing, Modi went on to win two landslide national elections, in 2014 and 2019, the second one bigger than the first. In fact, the BJP has won five of the last seven national elections.\n\nIn other words, India is firmly ensconced in the ranks of countries that, say, The Guardian\u2014that leading U.K. journalistic voice of international progressivism\u2014would describe as \u201cright-wing nationalist.\u201d By The Guardian\u2019s own count, these nations include India, Australia, Brazil, Hungary, the Philippines, Poland, and Russia. And of course, to that right-wing roster we can add the U.S.\u2014at least so long as Trump is in charge. (And other countries, too, including Austria, Israel, and Italy, have seen like-minded right-wingers at the helm.)\n\nWhat\u2019s notable about this list is how extensive it is. Indeed, if we were to consider other countries, not typically seen as \u201cright-wing\u201d but nonetheless nationalist, we would have an even longer list.\n\nFor instance, there\u2019s the People\u2019s Republic of China. Other than its commie name, it\u2019s hard to think of anything left-wing about China. And in the meantime, the Han Chinese, who run the country, are cracking down anyone who doesn\u2019t fit their Sinocentric vision, including Christians, Falun Gong believers, Tibetans, Uyhgurs, and, most recently, the free people of Hong Kong.\n\nSo is China left-wing or right-wing? Answer: That\u2019s an irrelevant question, because China is China, a land where Confucian and Maoist concepts transcend any Western typology.\n\nIn fact, most countries in the world seem to practice politics based on some sort of ethnic-based dominion, for which democracy\u2014if it exists at all\u2014is a way for the ruling class, usually ethnically determined, to work out its differences and deliver decisions to the rest of the population.\n\nBy this reckoning, if one really thinks about it, about the only countries in the world that could really be called \u201cliberal\u201d are in the West\u2014make that the Northwest. That is, there\u2019s liberal Canada, plus the European Union, led by Germany. Yet even within the EU, many states are in some condition of disagreement\u2014and even outright Brexit. Meanwhile, in the U.S., states such as Massachusetts and California are reliably liberal, as are many blue dots\u2014and then, in opposition, there\u2019s Trumplandia.\n\nIn other words, if we add up all the countries, we see that the number of nationalist countries is vastly larger than any liberal, or left, internationalist grouping.\n\nWe might dub the former group the \u201cNationalist International,\u201d as an ironic homage of sorts to the International Workingmen\u2019s Association, commonly referred to as the International, which first convened in London on September 28, 1864. For those who might wish to celebrate, the 155th anniversary of that convention is nigh upon us.\n\nThe First International fell apart in 1876, yet through an infinity of subsequent permutations, it embodied the hope for a left-wing international order\u2014workers of the world uniting, and all that.\n\nSuch border-busting class uniting never happened, of course, although the internationalist dream has certainly survived in many political parties and in many more organizations and ideologies. Indeed, it\u2019s fair to say that the executives and secretariats of globe-girdling entities\u2014and associated stakeholders, donors, recipients, journalistic cheerleaders, woke capitalists, and zealous street activists\u2014are just as true-believing in their internationalism as ever. Of course, the color of their belief has shifted from mostly red to mostly green (including the green of globalist cash), as well as the many hues of the LGBT rainbow.\n\nSo this is the great struggle of our era: who should rule\u2014the nationalists or the internationalists? Should it be nationalist political leaders such as Trump, Modi, and their kind? Or, rather, the mandarins of the internationalist nomenklatura? As Lenin, who knew a thing or two about deep conflict, always put it, the crucial question is kto kvo: \u201cwho [eats] whom.\u201d\n\nThis week, a particular flashpoint in New York City has been the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The IPCC, powered by the world\u2019s green energy\u2014more ideological and financial, as opposed to renewable\u2014has declared its aim to be the \u201cde-carbonizing\u201d of the the world economy by mid-century, if not sooner. Such a change, of course, would be the biggest shift since the world first started \u201ccarbonizing,\u201d three centuries ago.\n\nIndeed, the IPCC, engorged by the hopes, dreams, and clicks of every Guardian reader, surely rates as the newest planetary hegemon. So can the IPCC and its chattering allies correctly instruct the member-states of the Nationalist International to follow the dubious path of Germany, which is now sacrificing its crown jewel industry on an unforgiving altar? Can the IPCC\u2019s many international tentacles\u2014including politicized financial markets\u2014throttle Trump and all other recalcitrant nationalist leaders?\n\nSome will argue, of course, that the cause of combating climate change is so important that everything else\u2014every leader, every institution, every nation-state\u2014must bow down before it. Yet even if the climate science is as strong as the greens say it is, it\u2019s readily apparent that the issue can be addressed with incremental, Burkean remedies.\n\nIn the meantime, it\u2019s revealing that the IPCC and its youngest commissar, Greta Thunberg, have chosen to ignore the path of prudence and instead chosen the road of radicalism.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this sort of totalized thinking before. As we know, a different version of radicalism\u2014which thought of itself, too, as scientific\u2014sprouted up during the 19th century from groups such as the original International, and gained killer momentum in the 20th century.\n\nFortunately, in the 20th century, the International\u2019s myriad tentacular descendants were thwarted by sturdy nation-states, notably the United States. We can observe that back then, the U.S. was fighting for freedom, but even more, it was fighting for its existence. That\u2019s an enduring truth of nationalism: if a nation doesn\u2019t exist, questions about its political system\u2014and even its carbon dioxide emissions\u2014are moot.\n\nNow, in the 21st century, we see that the internationalist versus nationalist dynamic is back with us. So once again, it will be a fight.\n\nJames P. Pinkerton is an author and contributing editor at The American Conservative.
