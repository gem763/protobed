Scrambling to his left in the first quarter, he led receiver Randall Cobb too far on a third-down throw after Cobb broke free in the back of the end zone. The Cowboys settled for a field goal.\n\n\u201cI have to make that pass,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cWe just left a lot of plays out there tonight, and it showed.\u201d\n\nWhen Dallas got the ball at its 14-yard line with 1:39 left in the game and zero timeouts left, Prescott was sacked on the opening play, costing the Cowboys too much time.\n\n\u201cThat was a terrible decision taking that sack,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s rule one on two-minute drives, especially without a timeout.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys also coughed up the ball on back-to-back possessions in the first half.\n\nTight end Jason Witten lost a fumble when he was stripped by linebacker A.J. Klein near midfield after catching a pass over the middle.\n\n\u201cThat was a terrible turnover on my part,\u201d Witten said. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic, fundamental play. Line one for playing tight end is catching the ball over the middle and securing the catch. You have to be able to protect the ball. When you have one like that, it\u2019s hard to overcome.\u201d\n\nElliot then fumbled on a fourth-and-1 run from the Dallas 43, leading to a New Orleans field goal on the last play of the half.\n\nElliot\u2019s 1.9 average per carry was the second-lowest of his career, beating only the 0.9 he managed on eight rushes against Denver in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt was a tag-team deal,\u201d center Travis Frederick said. \u201cOn one play one person had something wrong and everybody else was good and the next play somebody else took a turn making a mistake.\u201d\n\nPrescott remained perfect for the year in the third quarter, going 6 of 6 on the Cowboys\u2019 lone touchdown drive to extend his mark to 28 of 28 for 457 yards and three touchdowns though four games.\n\nBut the passing game sputtered the rest of the night. Amari Cooper had five catches, but his longest gain was 14 yards.\n\n\u201cThey were giving us some different looks,\u201d Witten said. \u201cThey were rolling some coverages to Amari and forcing us to throw it underneath and we weren\u2019t able to sustain our running game enough.\u201d\n\nSix years after giving up an NFL-record 40 first downs to Drew Brees and the Saints in the Superdome, the Cowboys came up empty in a completely different way. With Brees watching from the sideline with an injured thumb, the offense could not produce the 13 points it needed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no confidence loss, I\u2019ll tell you that,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things we\u2019ll take from this, learn from it and become a better team because of it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dallas' dominance of overmatched opponents in its opening three games didn't seem to prepare the Cowboys well for a prime time road matchup with an NFC contender.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Guerry Smith"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/cowboys_saints_football_33810_c0-217-5184-3239_s1770x1032.jpg?8b8f23121690e0737bdb7f9c933479ff63e997a3", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
