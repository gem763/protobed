The other problem? That same non-porous quality that means this sponge doesn\u2019t harbor bacteria the same way also means that soap slides right off while you\u2019re attempting to scrub, which means with continued use you\u2019d wind up using so much more soap than usual, which feels super wasteful and is definitely not cost-effective. After washing a plate, a bowl, a pan, and a fork\u2014just to test a little bit of everything\u2014I gave up and went back to my boring, basic kitchen sponge (that I now appreciate even more than I used to).", "description": "Can a silicone sponge replace your basic disposable kitchen sponge for life, or does it sound too good to be true?", "authors": ["Brittney Morgan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.apartmenttherapy.info/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:eco,c_fill,g_auto,w_1500/https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fgen-atmedia%2F2%2F2017%2F04%2Fc5e40902d4e5faf8a84c79fb1c5c21cfa3d9c736.jpeg", "published_at": "2017-04-26"}
