Chambers caught 19 passes for 264 yards in 2018, but has played sparingly in 2019.\n\nChambers, who will be able to play at another school as a graduate transfer per the Detroit Free Press, joins linebacker Brandon Bouyer-Randle, running backs Connor Heyward and La\u2019Darius Jefferson and fellow receiver Weston Bridges in the transfer portal, which allows players to be contacted by other schools.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBouyer-Randle had five tackles in four games before exiting the program. Heyward led MSU with 529 rushing yards in 2018, but fell behind Elijah Collins on the depth chart in 2019. Jefferson had 255 yards and two scores in 2018 but mustered only 25 yards on 19 attempts in 2019 before deciding to transfer earlier this month. Bridges, who announced he would transfer on Monday, hadn\u2019t played in a game this year for MSU after seeing action in six games in 2018.\n\nIn the case of Chambers, his expected departure would mean that 12 of the 20 players from MSU\u2019s heralded 2016 recruiting class are no longer on the football team.\n\nMichigan State head coach Mark Dantonio during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Wisconsin Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019, in Madison, Wis. (AP Photo/Andy Manis)\n\nOn the field, Michigan State is just 4-3 so far this season after back-to-back blowout losses to Ohio State and Wisconsin by a combined score of 72-10. The loss to Wisconsin \u2014 a 38-0 debacle in Madison \u2014 was especially bad. The MSU offense mustered only 149 yards, causing reporters to once again question head coach Mark Dantonio\u2019s decision not to make any changes to his offensive staff after a disappointing 7-6 record in 2018. When the issue was brought up, Dantonio chastised a reporter for asking a \u201cdumb-ass question.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe discontent in East Lansing has led some to wonder what the future of the program looks like with Dantonio running the show. He\u2019s the most successful coach in MSU history, but things have gotten undeniably stagnant. There have been off-the-field issues as well, and five mid-season departures over the span of one month certainly won\u2019t help matters.\n\nYahoo Sports\u2019 Pete Thamel wrote about MSU\u2019s current conundrum earlier this week:\n\nDantonio is the winningest coach in school history, and firing him could be considered extreme under normal circumstances. But things are a mess on and off the field, not an ideal time for MSU to have a placeholder athletic director. Dantonio will need to do a seven-hour deposition tied to a wrongful termination suit after the season. Questions will include Dantonio\u2019s role in recruiting Auston Robertson to Michigan State. Robertson is in prison for sexual assault, and Dantonio has been accused of ignoring warning signs in his recruitment. (Could anything emerge that would prompt Dantonio to be dismissed for cause?)\n\nMSU is off this weekend before hosting undefeated Penn State on Oct. 26.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "In-season departures are piling up for the Michigan State football program.", "authors": ["Sam Cooper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tT7.zu3O4h2Nutk40AUA9g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tKiZn9F7DCLtTWMwplBNpA--~B/aD0xOTMzO3c9MjkwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/02effdc0-f0ff-11e9-bbec-a038804d9fba", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
