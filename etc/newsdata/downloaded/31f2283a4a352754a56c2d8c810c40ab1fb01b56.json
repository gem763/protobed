I've never felt prouder to say I'm Northern Irish.\"\n\nOk I actually posted the wrong video lol here's the countdown to midnight \u270a\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 pic.twitter.com/5Yg9bDj631 \u2014 Jamie \ud83c\udf83 (@JkUmisma) October 22, 2019\n\nPeople gathered at the Maverick bar in Belfast to celebrate and the atmosphere was joyful, according to locals.\n\n\"There were people who didn't know each other but were talking to each other, hugging each other, singing together and dancing together. There was a countdown to midnight when the laws came in and the eruption of cheer and applause was bigger than any New Year's party I've been to,\" Ciaran Gallagher, 30, told CNN.\n\nLess pleased was Northern Ireland's Democratic Union Party leader, Arlene Foster, who after the leaving the chamber said, \"it is a very sad day,\" according to Reuters.\n\n\"I know some people will seek to celebrate and I would say to those people, think of us who are sad today and who believe this is an affront to human dignity.\"\n\nWestminster steps in\n\nThe UK Parliament voted earlier this year for measures designed to keep the region running in the absence of a devolved government.\n\nIt set out that if the power-sharing executive was not restored by October 21, Westminster would introduce regulations that would make same-sex marriage and abortion lawful from January 13, 2020 and March 31, 2020.\n\nWhile access to abortion services won't be fully in place until March, the legislation stipulates that from October 22 women will no longer be prosecuted for seeking abortion services.\n\nAbortion rights supporters pose outside Stormont in Belfast on Monday.\n\nMonday marks almost three years since Northern Ireland 's joint government, made up of nationalist and unionist lawmakers, collapsed after Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness -- who died in 2017 -- stepped down because of a spat over a renewable energy policy.\n\nNorthern Ireland's complex power-sharing arrangement -- established as part of the peace process -- means that both the nationalist Sinn F\u00e9in party and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) must work together, and appoint a First Minister and Deputy First Minister who would lead the executive together.\n\nA snap election after McGuinness stepped down led to Sinn F\u00e9in, which wants a united Ireland, winning 27 seats -- one fewer than the DUP, the largest in the Executive.\n\nSince then, both parties have failed to reach an agreement -- with each blaming the other for it -- and the region has been governed without ministers, with its civil service operating its day-to-day administration, except without the ability to make key policy decisions.\n\nAbortion rules contravene UK human rights laws\n\nDespite abortion being legalized in the UK when the 1967 Abortion Act was passed, it has never been extended to Northern Ireland -- where a law from 1861 still exists.\n\nThe legislative actions by Westminster bring Northern Ireland's laws into line with the rest of the UK. The region has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world, with the procedure carrying maximum sentences of life imprisonment, even in cases of rape, incest and fatal fetal abnormality.\n\nFor years, MPs across the political divide urged the UK government to change the law in Northern Ireland; the region's laws came under increased scrutiny after the Republic of Ireland legalized abortion following a referendum in 2018.\n\nWomen in the province have been forced to travel to other parts of the UK to access terminations, and earlier this month the High Court in Belfast ruled that its abortion rules contravene UK human rights laws.\n\nThe case was heard by Justice Keegan after Sarah Ewart challenged the law having been denied an abortion in Northern Ireland in 2013, even though doctors had said her unborn child would not survive outside the womb. Instead she traveled to London to end her pregnancy.\n\nThe judge said the prospect that another woman would have to face the same \"trauma and pain\" should be avoided in future.", "description": "At the stroke of midnight on Monday, Northern Ireland's restrictive abortion and same-sex marriage laws came to an end, after the region failed to restore its power-sharing executive that collapsed more than 1,000 days ago.", "authors": ["Bianca Britton", "Sheena Mckenzie", "Gianluca Mezzofiore"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191022034506-02-northern-ireland-abortion-1021-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
