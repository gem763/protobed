In that way the pay-off is a no-brainer.\n\n\"I'm alive, I'm fine, so what do they matter?\"\n\n(Image: SplashNews.com)\n\nAndrea credited her husband Nick Feeney, 46, for helping her love her scars.\n\nShe added: \"Nick and I laugh about them together - we call them my Lara Croft scars! My battle wounds.\n\n\"They don't bother him and they don't bother me.\"\n\n(Image: Brett D.
