A record 50 percent say they dislike him personally and dislike his policies, while another 19 percent say that they dislike him but approve of his policies.\n\nJust 29 percent say they like Trump personally, with 25 percent saying they also approve of his policy agenda and 4 percent saying they disapprove.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nbcnews.Com Politics Meet-The-Press"], "top_image": ""}
