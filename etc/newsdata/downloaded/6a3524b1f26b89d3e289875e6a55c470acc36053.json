More people voted Leave in 2016 than have ever voted for anything. Parliament promised to respect the referendum result. But Parliament has repeatedly avoided doing this,\" Johnson wrote.\n\nBritish lawmakers said they needed more time to look over the deal when they voted down the fast-track agreement earlier this week.\n\nWhen asked what he would do if the Labour Party refused to vote for an election, Johnson told the BBC \"we would campaign day after day for the people of this country to be released from subjection to a Parliament that has outlived its usefulness.\"", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Thursday he would give members of Parliament (MPs) more time to debate his Brexit deal in exchange for a general election on Dec. 12.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/johnsonboris_092919getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
