We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons\u2026\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nSo why not continue accepting ads while trying to stamp out misinformation? He argued that the company \u201cneeds to focus our efforts on the root problems, without the additional burden and complexity taking money brings.\u201d\n\nA blanket policy could also help Twitter avoid the headache and controversy of making these determinations of truthfulness on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThis comes after Facebook, in particular, has faced heavy criticism around its refusal to fact-check political advertising (even as it took steps to fight election-related misinformation elsewhere), with Facebook employees writing an open letter objecting to the company\u2019s stance.\n\nAt the same time, one of the ads that prompted the recent controversy \u2014 in which the Trump campaign promoted a conspiracy theory about Joe Biden \u2014 also ran on YouTube and Twitter (and on some TV networks, although CNN refused to air it).\n\nSo even though the discussion has focused on Facebook, the broader questions of permissiveness and responsibility are ones that all the major internet platforms have to face.\n\nOver the summer, in fact, Twitter said it would start blocking state-run media outlets from running ads on its platform after it identified an operation to \u201csow political discord\u201d around the protests in Hong Kong, which involved hundreds of accounts linked to the Chinese government.\n\nThe idea that Facebook should just ban all political ads is a solution that\u2019s been floated by a number of pundits, including our own Josh Constine. Before today, that might have seemed like an extreme or unrealistic step. Suddenly, it looks much more possible \u2014 or at least like Mark Zuckerberg will have to keep answering questions about this for a while.\n\nDorsey didn\u2019t mention Facebook by name in his tweets, but he seemed to allude to the company\u2019s position when he wrote, \u201cFor instance, it\u2018s not credible for us to say: \u2018We\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad\u2026well\u2026they can say whatever they want! \ud83d\ude09'\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting that Twitter chose to announce this just as Facebook released its latest earnings report.\n\nDorsey also acknowledged that Twitter is \u201ca small part of a much larger political advertising ecosystem,\u201d but he said, \u201cWe have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising. I trust this will only grow.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, eMarketer senior analyst Jasmine Enberg said the move is \u201cin stark contrast to Facebook,\u201d but also noted \u201cit\u2019s likely that political advertising doesn\u2019t make up a critical part of Twitter\u2019s core business.\u201d", "description": "CEO Jack Dorsey just announced, via tweet, that Twitter will be banning all political advertising \u2014 albeit with \u201ca few exceptions\u201d like voter registration. \u201cWe believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,\u201d Dorsey said.
