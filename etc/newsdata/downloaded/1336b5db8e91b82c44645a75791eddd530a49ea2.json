Sacoolas, the wife of a U.S. diplomat, left the U.K. after the fatal crash and the State Department has blocked British investigators by claiming diplomatic immunity.\n\nWith the help of the Dunn family\u2019s activism, the incident has made international headlines. For weeks they have been pleading with British and American officials to bring Sacoolas back to the U.K. to face justice.\n\n\u201cThe bombshell was dropped not soon after we walked in the room that Sacoolas was in the building and was willing to meet with us,\u201d Charles said. \u201cWe made it very clear, as we\u2019ve said all along, we will meet with her and we are still willing to see her\u2026 but it has to be on our terms and on U.K. soil.\u201d\n\nAlthough they were surprised by the circumstances surrounding the meeting, the Dunn family said that they were pleased with how Trump otherwise handled the meeting.\n\nCharles called Trump \u201cgracious,\u201d and said that when the family asked him to put himself in their shoes and consider what he would do if was his son, Trump told them he would \u201cpush to look at this from a different angle.\u201d\n\nBut Tim Dunn, Harry\u2019s father, told Sky News in the same interview that Trump did not suggest returning Sacoolas to the U.K. and that the surprise meeting was not what the family had in mind. \u201cWe said from the start that\u2019s not what we wanted,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t ready to meet her and we felt a bit rushed.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump told reporters that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had urged him to meet with the Dunn family, and confirmed he set up the surprise meeting believing that the Dunn family would want to meet Sacoolas.\n\n\u201cI offered to bring the person in question in and they weren\u2019t ready for it,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nTrump added that car accidents in the U.K. caused by drivers driving on the wrong side of the road were common. \u201cThat happens to a lot of people by the way,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to 2016 data from the World Health Organization, the road traffic death rate in the U.S. is four times higher than in the U.K.\n\nMark Stephens, the Dunn family attorney, told Sky News in a video interview that the reason Dunn\u2019s family went to the White House was to make a \u201cheartfelt plea to the President for justice.\u201d Instead, Stephens said Trump surprised the family with Sacoolas and his plan to present them as a \u201chappy family,\u201d to waiting reporters.\n\n\"It was a gargantuan miscalculation.\"\n\n\n\nThe lawyer advising the parents of Harry Dunn says it was \"so wrong\" that they were not told before meeting President Donald Trump that Anne Sacoolas was also at the White House.\n\n\n\nLatest on this story here: https://t.co/VGSPxnkUmd pic.twitter.com/OyzDunzygp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Sky News (@SkyNews) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, that was a gargantuan miscalculation and it\u2019s just one in a series of gargantuan miscalculations,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cSpiriting her [Sacoolas] away from the U.K., making her a fugitive from justice and bringing her that way was just so wrong.\u201d\n\nNorthamptonshire Police confirmed that a 42-year-old American woman \u2014 who has been identified by U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab as Sacoolas \u2014 is the suspect in a car crash that killed 19-year-old Dunn on Aug. 27. According to police, Sacoolas left the country even after telling authorities she had no plans to do so.\n\nSacoolas\u2019 relationship to her husband, a U.S. diplomat, gives her diplomatic immunity, allowing her to avoid arrest for almost any crime unless the U.S. decides to revoke it. The State Department told TIME in a statement that immunity was \u201crarely waived.\u201d", "description": "The Dunn family rejected White House's \"bombshell\" offer to meet with the wife of U.S. diplomat who is a suspect in their son's fatal car accident", "authors": ["Gina Martinez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T7hcM7Kt9DJEZzhOLoUHTA--~B/aD03OTk7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/3cb5c393a0d29cd8d37c9b3def2d0351", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
