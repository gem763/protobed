The law may support the director of national intelligence\u2019s refusal to forward the whistleblower report to Congress. As an article in Lawfare points out, past presidents also have asserted a right to determine whether to share classified information with Congress.\n\nFor example, when President Clinton signed the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, he issued a statement noting that the Constitution \u201cvests the President with authority to control disclosure of information when necessary for the discharge of his constitutional responsibilities.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible that a court will decide that Congress does have a right to see the complaint Maguire is refusing to turn over \u2014 perhaps in conjunction with the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to be a Trump supporter to worry about the precedent this would set for future presidents who want to be able to speak candidly to foreign leaders. That\u2019s the problem with Trump: His trashing of norms of behavior that have been followed by past presidents means that future presidents may find it harder to do their job.", "description": "", "authors": ["Michael Mcgough", "Latimes.Com Opinion Story Opinion-Trumps-Ukraine-Whistleblower-Flap-Future-Presidents"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
