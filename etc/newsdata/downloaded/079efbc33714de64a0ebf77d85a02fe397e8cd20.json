Whistle-blower says Trump aides disturbed by Ukraine call", "language": "en", "text": "The plot thickens, as it always does.\n\nNow we all get to argue about the mystery whistle-blower.\n\nThe disclosure that the man who set this in motion does not support Donald Trump\u2019s reelection\u2014a shocker, I know\u2014will fuel counterattacks by the president and his allies. That information comes from the New York Times describing the view of intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson. The source wants to remain anonymous, but the chances that the name doesn\u2019t leak seem to me to be nil.\n\nIMPEACHMENT IS RISKY, BUT TRANSCRIPT SUPPORTS MEDIA\u2019S UKRAINE REPORTING\n\nIn fact, the Times yesterday reported yesterday that the person who filed the complaint \u201cis a C.I.A. officer who was detailed to work at the White House at one point, according to three people familiar with his identity.\u201d\n\nEditor Dean Baquet, responding preemptively to possible criticism, justified the disclosure: \u201cThe role of the whistle-blower, including his credibility and his place in the government, is essential to understanding one of the most important issues facing the country \u2014 whether the president of the United States abused power and whether the White House covered it up.\u201d\n\nTrump pounced on the secret source at a private New York breakfast, according to the Los Angeles Times. (He also called reporters \u201cscum.\u201d I feel this episode has strained our close relations.)\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistle-blower the information?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cBecause that\u2019s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nIn fairness, the CIA officer did go through official channels, and the acting intelligence chief spent hours yesterday deflecting a House committee\u2019s questions of why he didn\u2019t move more quickly on the complaint.\n\nI\u2019m inclined not to care that much about the whistle-blower, who had no first-hand knowledge of these matters. We already know more than he did because we\u2019ve got the rough transcript.\n\nBut there was a key revelation in the complaint, made public yesterday. And it wasn\u2019t that CIA man felt the president was pressuring Ukraine on Joe Biden \u201cfor personal gain.\u201d Everyone is familiar with that charge by now.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nNo, it was that several White House officials were \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by what they heard on the call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, the complaint said. Which means more officials are going to be called to testify on the Hill.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the unknown complainant claims to have information that \u201csenior White House officials had intervened to \u2018lock down\u2019 all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced as is customary by the White House Situation Room.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, it\u2019s harder for the president and his team to argue that this was a routine diplomatic call if some people who worked for him treated it as a hair-on-fire moment.\n\nIn fact, the scenario here is that the whistle-blower wouldn\u2019t even have known about the call had some White House officials not been upset. Instead, the source concluded that Trump \u201csought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take actions to help the president\u2019s 2020 reelection bid.\u201d\n\nStill, Trump tweeted yesterday that this is \u201cTHE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!\u201d He also called it \u201ca disgrace to our country.\u201d\n\nIn a typical probe, the actual words spoken between the president and a foreign leader would be the last revelation of a long, bottom-up investigation, rather than something coughed up within a week of the first newspaper stories. But that means the media and Congress are having to work backwards, to reconstruct what led up to the fateful call.\n\nAnd the complaint, as well as the rough transcript of the call, makes clear that Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr were key players in the Ukraine drama.\n\nABC quotes a former Zelensky adviser as saying after the onetime comedian was elected in April, they wanted to speak to Trump. But, said Serhiy Leshchenko, a former member of parliament, \u201cIt was clear that Trump will only have communications if they will discuss the Biden case.\u201d\n\nThis was presumably after the first congratulatory call that Trump placed to Zelensky in April, which he\u2019s said he is willing to release. The New York Times, quoting unnamed sources, said the president urged Zelensky to work with Giuliani in pursuing \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nSo this is becoming quite the detective story. But it still can\u2019t be separated from the politics of impeachment, and most Republicans are backing the president\u2019s stance that the call was no big deal.\n\nCliff Sims, a former White House aide who in litigation with the president over a somewhat critical book, told Politico: \"Democrats overreaching has been such a political gift to Trump, over and over again. They've been screaming 'treason!' and 'impeachment!' after nearly everything that happens. Middle America is mostly numb to it.\u201d\n\nThat is the challenge facing the House Democrats, 220 of whom now support the impeachment probe, beyond the magic number of 218. And sooner or later, the intelligence officer who preferred to remain nameless will be under a very harsh spotlight.", "description": "Now we all get to argue about the mystery whistle-blower.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/26/694940094001_6089822881001_6089810725001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
