He's steady, reserved, and thoughtful \u2014 the kind of guy who will sit quietly and observe in group settings but surprise you with a hilarious one-liner when he gets to know you. I, on the other hand, am outgoing, expressive, and impulsive. If I'm not talking your ear off, there's probably something wrong.\n\nIn most scenarios, our personalities complement each other. But they also shape our financial mindsets and behaviors, which can cause conflict between us. You can probably guess that my husband is a natural saver, and given my taste for instant gratification, I'm more prone to spend.\n\nWe've been married almost a decade, and we've definitely made our fair share of money mistakes \u2014 mostly due to poor communication and lack of planning.\n\nOver the years, though, with the support of our financially savvy friends and a great financial adviser, we've made our spending differences work.\n\nThink your relationship could benefit from talking to a financial adviser?

When we give every dollar a \"job,\" we prevent both overspending and potential conflict.\n\nTo make sure I have space to spend when it's appropriate and we save as much as my husband thinks is wise, we can simply designate money to those categories. That way, both of us feel like our \"needs\" are being met.\n\nAllotting monthly spending money\n\nWhen it comes to our finances, the biggest point of contention in our relationship is unplanned purchases.\n\nWhile I don't see a problem with Happy Hour a few times a week, my husband would probably opt to stay home and cook dinner. The hard part is I'm a social person, and saying no to every get-together isn't realistic (or fun).\n\nRather than spending mindlessly on restaurants or cutting them out altogether, we simply created a line item in our budget for personal spending.\n\nEach of us gets a certain amount of cash every month, which we can use however we want. I typically use mine on food and drinks, and he will often save his over the course of a few months for a larger purchase. The caveat is, when it's gone, it's gone.\n\nWhile setting a limit helps me understand how quickly I spend and keeps me from feeling as though I have to hide purchases, having the money available encourages my husband to invest in himself from time to time.\n\nRunning big purchases past each other\n\nNo matter how diligently we plan, there will always be times we deviate from our budget. In these cases, we always make an effort to run unplanned purchases of more than $100 by each other.\n\nIf my husband wants to order something expensive online on a whim, he will always ask what I think, and out of respect, I do the same for him. This simple exchange is all it takes to prevent conflict.\n\nUsing the \"wait and see rule\"\n\nAnother trick I use to curb my spending is the \"wait and see rule,\" which I picked up from a friend.\n\nOften, I'll see something I \"have to have\" at the store, and almost instantly regret the purchase when I get home. To avoid impulse buying, I'll wait 48 hours before saying yes to something I want. If I still \"have to\" have it, I can go back to the store and buy it, but usually the \"wait and see\" time creates a buffer and I totally forget.\n\nGoing through bank statements together\n\nOne of my worst qualities is avoidance. As a result, I don't prioritize reviewing bank or credit card statements. I'd rather pretend they're not there \u2014 which has led me to spend more money than I should have at the grocery store or the mall.\n\nTo make sure we're on the same page about how much we have coming in and out, my husband and I review our bank statements together at least monthly.\n\nI'll update him on freelance projects I'm working on and how much money I'm expecting to come in, and he'll highlight (sometimes to my chagrin) ways we've overspent in the last month.\n\nIt's not always the most enjoyable conversation, but taking time to get a big-picture view of our finances keeps us from poor decisions \u2014 and, more importantly, protects our relationship.", "description": "A decade into marriage, this spender/saver couple has figured out how to manage their money and keep their relationship in tact.", "authors": ["Ashley Abramson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8e65532e22af21d4789d9b-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
