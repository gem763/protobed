Using AR, students will also be able to superimpose anatomical structures over a peer who can perform movements along with the app to understand muscle function, the university claims.\n\nThe students will also have access to HTC VR headsets while on campus, which the university said can be used by students to visualise and manipulate anatomical structures.\n\nAccording to La Trobe, the aim of the pilot is to help students improve spatial awareness, explorative learning, and accessibility to 3D anatomy images -- from skeletons to human specimens -- plus associated text, clinical cases, and quizzes.\n\n\"The reason we've done this is because it shows the students we fully support technology. It also gives them the accessibility, mobility, and dexterity of using these resources so when they leave, they can feel they are confident to use it off campus as well,\" head of the Anatomy Discipline Aaron McDonald told ZDNet.\n\nSee also: Can you use AR and VR to teach employees soft skills? (TechRepublic)\n\n\"The big thing with the content is there's always heaps of information and that can lead to content overload, so we have designed the material so they can build on information and not get inundated with all this information.\"\n\nMcDonald added that the technology would change the way students do group work.\n\n\"It allows us to re-write group activity for anatomy \u2026 we've designed the activities so students can work in groups with AR over iPads,\" he said.\n\nAssistant lecturer of Human Anatomy Heath McGowan touted the cost of using AR technology would also significantly reduce the cost for students.\n\n\"Rather than have students spend AU$40-something on the licence, we have purchased a buying in bulk deal for AU$10 per licence for the AR technology so students can install that application for free. This makes it more portable and accessible than even just a textbook that can sometimes cost AU$150,\" he said.\n\nMcGowan said there are plans to expand the technology to be used for all anatomy courses, including physiotherapy, podiatry, and speech pathology at all La Trobe university campuses in Bundoora, Bendigo, and Albury-Wodonga.\n\n\"We want to see if we can benefit students not just in the short term but can we up their marks and skills permanently,\" he said.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "The 12-week pilot aims to help students improve spatial awareness, explorative learning, and accessibility to 3D anatomical images.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/08/c1490028-72f4-4ce5-873d-6bfac8dd74af/thumbnail/770x578/90a90e3aebfaa5495e5b65c76a643538/latrobe-ar-pilot.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
