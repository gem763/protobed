Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces, told NBC News on Monday that his intelligence unit was connected to a source within Baghdadi\u2019s inner circle who was able to detail the layout of his compound, including tunnels and the number of guards.\n\nAbdi described the individual, who remains unidentified, as one of Baghdadi\u2019s security advisers. The source was present during the Saturday night operation in northwestern Syria, Abdi said.\n\nOver the summer, the source proved to American intelligence that he had access to Baghdadi by providing a blood sample from the terrorist leader and a used pair of underwear.\n\nShortly after NBC\u2019s story emerged, Fox News reported that Mazloum had credited a source inside Baghdadi\u2019s residence with leading U.S. forces to the target.\n\nDuring his Sunday news conference announcing the raid\u2019s success, President Donald Trump said the Kurds had \u201cnot [played] a military role at all, but they gave us some information that turned out to be helpful.\u201d\n\nIn light of Monday\u2019s reports, the remark appears to have downplayed the work of the Kurds in finding Baghdadi, potentially adding insult to injury after the president pulled U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria earlier this month. The sudden departure left the U.S.-allied Kurds, who have been fighting ISIS for years, open to attacks from Turkey.\n\nAccording to military and counterterrorism officials who spoke to The New York Times, Trump was aware that American forces were zeroing in on Baghdadi when he ordered the troop withdrawal.\n\nThe sudden move, the officials said, upended careful planning for the mission and forced the Pentagon to press fast-forward on the raid, meaning it happened despite Trump\u2019s actions rather than because of his leadership.\n\nLove HuffPost?
