All the calls are high pitched so for the human ear it\u2019s hard to hear these differences but using acoustic analysis we could locate these calls to distinct areas.\n\n\u201cThe ear of the marmoset is much more in tune to these calls so the differences are clearly audible to them.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They thought it could be caused by genetic differences, environmental factors or learnt through social learning.\n\nTo answer this, they analysed the calls of common marmosets \u2013 which normally travel around in groups of between three and 15 individuals \u2013 before and after they moved to a new colony.\n\nThey looked at captive marmosets in three colonies in Spain, Italy and Switzerland. Each group did not have direct contact with the new group but they still adapted their calls in as little as a few weeks.\n\n\u201cWe could clearly show that the dialects of common marmosets are learned socially,\u201d said the first author of the study, Yvonne Zurcher, from the University of Zurich.\n\n\u201cIf their dialects were genetically determined, moving to a new place wouldn\u2019t cause any change in calls. The changes can\u2019t be explained by differences in the environment either,\u201d she said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

One of their defining social behaviours is their cooperative breeding and infant care systems with siblings and offspring caring for young ones.\n\nDr Burkart said: \u201cIt\u2019s like with humans \u2013 when you move to a new place you accommodate new accents. If you want to demarcate difference you differentiate your accent more.\n\n\u201cWe call this \u2018crowd vocal learning\u2019. It\u2019s amazing because you would think the social contact is really important but it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe monkeys that moved to the new environment changed their dialect more but it is likely that the original group did too.\u201d\n\nScientists say the study shows the common marmoset is an important model system to understand the origins of language.\n\n\u201cThe function was there already and this is something that language could build on,\u201d Dr Burkart said.\n\nNext researchers want to look at how accents change when monkeys socially interact.", "description": "Marmoset monkeys rapidly adapt\u00a0their dialects\u00a0when they move to new territories\u00a0\u2013 changing their \u201caccents\u201d in just a few weeks, a new study shows.\u00a0 Adapting their calls could be a way\u00a0to signal their interest in the new group and increase the chance of meeting a partner, according to the paper published in Plos One.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/23/14/istock-526127344.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
