No loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family.\n\nCharlotte Charles and her partner said they haven\u2019t been able to grieve for their son\u2019s death ahead of the US visit (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018The media reporting has been inaccurate in many respects. To begin with, Anne fully cooperated with the police and the investigation.\n\n\u2018She spoke with authorities at the scene of the accident and met with the Northampton police at her home the following day. She will continue to cooperate with the investigation.\n\n\u2018Anne would like to meet with Mr Dunn\u2019s parents so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident.\n\n\u2018We have been in contact with the family\u2019s attorneys and look forward to hearing from them.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents Charlotte and Tim, who said they haven\u2019t been able to grieve over their son\u2019s death, had flown to the US to put pressure on officials to \u2018do the right thing\u2019.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, their spokesman appealed for witnesses to come forward if they had seen Ms Sacoolas leaving the UK.\n\nBoris Johnson said on Friday that the US had been \u2018absolutely ruthless\u2019 in its safeguarding of Ms Sacoolas after granting her immunity.\n\nCharlotte Charles with son Harry (Picture: PA)\n\nThe PM said although President Trump was sympathetic towards Harry\u2019s family\u2019s views on the use of diplomatic immunity, the US were \u2018very reluctant\u2019 to allow citizens to be tried abroad.\n\nFollowing an earlier phone call with the British PM, Mr Trump called the crash a \u2018terrible accident\u2019 but defended Ms Sacoolas saying it was easy to drive on the wrong side of the road.\n\nSpeaking ahead of their campaign in the US, Harry\u2019s family said in a statement that they \u2018continue to live in a nightmare\u2019.\n\nA statement released on behalf of the family said: \u2018As if losing Harry was not enough, they now find themselves having to expend enormous time and energy, which they can ill afford, generating sufficient publicity to garner public support to persuade the US government to help achieve closure and return the driver Mrs Sacoolas to England to face the consequences of her actions.\n\nHarry\u2019s parents said they have been \u2018living in a nightmare\u2019 (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018Sadly, all such efforts to date have failed. The parents, after a brief period of rest, are therefore now taking their campaign to the USA and will visit New York City and Washington DC over the coming days, engaging with the media and politicians as they reach out for support from all Americans and to ask them to put pressure on the US administration to do the right thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They are looking forward to making as many new friends in the USA as possible.\n\n\u2018Harry\u2019s family will simply not leave matters where they are and will do whatever it takes, including taking legal action if necessary, to secure Justice 4 Harry.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
