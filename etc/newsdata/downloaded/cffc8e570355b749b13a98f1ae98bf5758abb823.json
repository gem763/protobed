Trump\u2019s tweet appeared aimed at buttressing Netanyahu\u2019s effort to remain in power by showcasing his close ties to the White House.\n\nOpinion polls predict a close race, five months after an election in which Netanyahu declared himself the winner but failed to put together a coalition government.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s Likud party is neck-and-neck with the centrist Blue and White party led by former armed forces chief Benny Gantz, who has focused heavily on corruption charges against Netanyahu.\n\nTrump bolstered Netanyahu\u2019s candidacy when he recognized Israel\u2019s claim of sovereignty over the Golan Heights ahead of the elections earlier this year.\n\nSome Israeli officials have promoted the idea of building on Netanyahu\u2019s strong ties to the Trump administration by forging a new defense treaty with the US, focused especially on guarantees of assistance in any conflict with Iran.\n\nSome of Netanyahu\u2019s critics have argued that such an agreement could tie Israel\u2019s hands and deny it military autonomy.", "description": "President appears to try to boost Netanyahu before tight poll while PM says he looks forward to meeting at United Nations in New York", "authors": ["Reuters In Washington", "Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ccb0a93369af47059a4188079501b25605b1cbb/0_164_2465_1480/master/2465.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=49cc55e61ee2f8cf351ff5fc09812d44", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
