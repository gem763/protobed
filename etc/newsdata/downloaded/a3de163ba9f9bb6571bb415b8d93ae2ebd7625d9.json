The company told Business Insider in early July that it was doubling the size of its customer service team and making other updates to its customer experience following a flood of complaints.\n\nRead more: Rent the Runway CEO scrambles to respond to frustrated customers as complaints about delays pile up on social media\n\nHyman told Bloomberg on Thursday that roughly 14% of Rent the Runway's subscriber base was impacted by the problems. According to a source with knowledge of the situation, less than 6% of event renters \u2014 many of whom use the service for special events \u2014 also experienced issues.\n\nThe crisis could cost Rent the Runway millions of dollars\n\nAccording to Bob Buffone, chief technology officer at web optimization software company Yottaa, companies can expect to lose 10-20% of subscribers who are impacted by issues in situations such as Rent the Runway's supply chain crisis.\n\nWith roughly 14% of Rent the Runway's reported active member base of around 100,000 impacted, 10% of impacted subscribers quitting could mean losing 1,400 people \u2014 who bring in at least $2.7 million a year, based on the cost of a monthly Unlimited subscription.\n\nPeople whose Rent the Runway orders were canceled will receive an additional $200 in cash, on top of refunds for their orders. At least some of the other Rent the Runway customers whose rentals have been delayed are also receiving compensation, such as discounts on upcoming months of the service.\n\nWhile sending thousands of people refunds and discounts will be a significant cost in the short term, it will be a worthwhile expense if it prevents people from canceling subscriptions.\n\n\"We are sorry, and we own this,\" Hyman wrote in an email sent out to customers and obtained by Business Insider. \"Everything we are doing today is to improve your Rent the Runway membership for the long-term and you should feel this improvement within the next three weeks.\"\n\nRent the Runway declined to comment on how many people's orders had been canceled and were therefore eligible to get an additional $200 from the company. A representative also declined to comment on how many people had received other forms of compensation and the estimated cost of the recent problems.", "description": "Rent the Runway is attempting to keep subscribers on board with refunds, discounts, and offers of $200 to people whose orders were canceled.", "authors": ["Kate Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d14f90a9dfbce1146588c33?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
