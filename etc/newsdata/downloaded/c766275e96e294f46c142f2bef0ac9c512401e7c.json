Driving with a cracked coupling may lead to loss of power or unintended vehicle movement, and the potential separation of the driveshaft could lead to accident and injury, Ford says.\n\nThe recall impacts 293,558 vehicles in the U.S., 22,960 in Canada and 2,744 in Mexico.\n\nThe Ford Edge is being recalled due to a defect in seat belts that may keep them from snapping tight to hold occupants in place in a crash, the automaker said. The recall affects 366 vehicles in the U.S. and 65 in Canada.\n\nEighteen Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigators are being recalled because their rear toe link fastener, a piece of equipment that stabilizes the rear of the car and keeps wheels on the ground during turns, may not have been properly fastened during assembly, Ford said. A malfunction while driving could lead to loss of control, Ford said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nLast week, the automaker reported mixed third-quarter results and lowered its 2019 full-year earnings guidance.\n\nFord shares have climbed 12.5 percent this year.", "description": "Ford Transit vehicles make up the bulk of the recall.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/ford-transit-van-2017.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
