He is now hoping to turn that into a majority.\n\n\"It'll be a tough election and we are going to do the best we can,\" he said.\n\n- 'Let the people decide' -\n\nBritain's first December vote in nearly 100 years and third general election in four years finds the main opposition Labour Party splintered by bitter infighting.\n\nPro-EU supporters from big cities have been at loggerheads with Brexit-backing groups such as trade unions as well as party leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nBut the veteran socialist is an energetic campaigner who nearly managed to secure an upset victory in the last general election in 2017.\n\nCorbyn calls the vote \"a once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country\" and is promising \"the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change\".\n\nHis deputy and finance spokesman John McDonnell hailed his boss's abilities on the stump.\n\n\"I think we'll have a majority government by Christmas, so I can't think of a better Christmas present,\" he told BBC radio on Wednesday.\n\nLabour's Brexit promise is to seize power and then strike a more European-friendly agreement with Brussels that preserves many of the existing trade ties.\n\nIt would then let voters choose between that deal and the option of simply staying in the EU.\n\n\"We're saying -- democracy, let the people decide,\" McDonnell said.\n\n- New hopefuls -\n\nThe two other main players are adopting much firmer Brexit stances.\n\nThe fast-rising Liberal Democrats are going into the vote on a simple promise of stopping the EU-UK divorce by any means.\n\nThe party used a similar message to finish a surprising second in the European Parliament elections in May.\n\nA poll of polls compiled by Britain Elects put them in third place with 18 percent of the vote. The Conservatives led second-place Labour by 35 to 25 percent.\n\nA similar outcome could turn the Liberal Democrats into powerbrokers who decide the makeup and direction of the new government.\n\nBut party leader Jo Swinson said her polling showed the party was \"within a small swing\" of winning \"hundreds of seats\".\n\n\"I can't be clearer. Neither Boris Johnson nor Corbyn is fit to be prime minister,\" Swinson told BBC radio.\n\n\"Our country deserves a better choice, and I am standing as candidate to be prime minister.\"\n\nThe Brexit Party of anti-European populist Nigel Farage stands on the opposite end of the political spectrum and holds fourth place on 11 percent.\n\nFarage was one of the Brexit campaign's figureheads who won the May European poll within months of forming his new group.\n\nBut his party's impact has been muted by Johnson's own firm pro-Brexit message. Farage is now denouncing Johnson's agreement with Brussels as a sellout of Brexit interests.", "description": "Britain's political leaders tested their election pitches on Wednesday after parliament backed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's bid for a pre-Christmas poll aimed at breaking the lengthy Brexit deadlock.
