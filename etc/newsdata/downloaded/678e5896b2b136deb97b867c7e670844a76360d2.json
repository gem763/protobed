(AP) - Mitchell Trubisky wants the Bears to believe this will be the week their struggling offense gets going.\n\nIt might actually be that week because Chicago is facing a Washington Redskins defense that hasn\u2019t been able to stop much of anything.\n\nThe Bears (1-1) go into Monday night\u2019s matchup with the third-worst offense in the NFL through the first two weeks of the season. Fortunately for them, the Redskins (0-2) rank third-worst on defense and are dealing with some key injuries contributing to that disappointing start.\n\n\u201cThey got some openings where we could have some success on offense this week,\u201d Trubisky said Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to believe that this offense can explode at any minute because of the playmakers and the special guys we have in the locker room.\u201d\n\nChicago\u2019s offense has produced just one touchdown through two games - a 1-yard-run by David Montgomery last week - and Trubisky is a combined 42 of 72 for 348 yards and an interception. The 2017 second overall pick is near the bottom of the league at 4.8 yards a completion.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s just about getting into that rhythm and then understanding the execution of the plays,\u201d coach Matt Nagy said. \u201cAnd us as coaches, too, making sure that we\u2019re putting them in optimum position to make the plays with whatever play call is made. We\u2019re not running different plays. We\u2019re not running anything different than we did last year. It\u2019s a long season.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the mantra inside the Redskins\u2019 locker room where injuries to defensive lineman Jonathan Allen and cornerbacks Fabian Moreau and Quinton Dunbar have contributed to them getting worn down as games go on. Coach Jay Gruden said it\u2019s not time to panic yet, but the defense underachieving is alarming.\n\nWashington has allowed a combined 569 yards in the second half in losses to Philadelphia and Dallas .\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re struggling a little bit, but it takes time,\u201d defensive tackle Tim Settle said. \u201cThe more we work together as a team, the more we progress as a team, the better we\u2019re going to get. We\u2019re going to get things rolling. It\u2019s going to be pretty.\u201d\n\nNot much is pretty about the Redskins\u2019 defense or the Bears\u2019 offense so far. Settle mentioned communication as an issue, and first-year Washington middle linebacker Jon Bostic pointed to a lack of cohesiveness on the defensive side of the ball.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s got to be on the same page,\u201d Bostic said. \u201cIf you got 10 guys on the same page and one guy that\u2019s off it, it\u2019s going to lead to an explosive play. Explosive plays win ballgames for you.\u201d\n\nA big kick by Eddy Pineiro won the Bears their game last week at Denver, and they\u2019re still looking for the big plays that have eluded them.\n\n\u201cThat comes down to everybody being locked in, making sure that everybody\u2019s on being on the same page - no miscues on any part of the offense,\u201d Chicago receiver Allen Robinson said. \u201cIt just comes down to everybody being on the same page and executing.\u201d\n\nSome things to watch when the Bears visit the Redskins on Monday night:\n\nMONSTERS OF THE MIDWAY\n\nUnlike the Redskins, the Bears\u2019 defense is doing just fine. It\u2019s ranked fourth in the league and sixth against the run under new coordinator Chuck Pagano after Vic Fangio left to take the Broncos\u2019 head coaching job.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re physical in the middle and they have speed at linebacker,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cThey have good edge play. They have a safety that\u2019s a ball hawk. Their corners are pretty good and experienced. They don\u2019t really have a weakness in their defense.\u201d\n\nChicago has seven sacks through two games, two off the league lead.\n\nKEENUM IN RHYTHM\n\nCase Keenum won Washington\u2019s starting QB job essentially by default because longtime backup Colt McCoy is still injured and first-round pick Dwayne Haskins isn\u2019t ready. But Keenum is far from a problem for the Redskins, throwing for 601 yards and five touchdown passes with no interceptions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m well aware of Case Keenum and what he can do,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously having a good year right now. Statically he\u2019s protecting the football. He\u2019s very, very football smart. So his football IQ is high. He gets the ball out.\u201d\n\nBIG KICK\n\nThe Bears brought in a long line of kickers during the offseason after letting the embattled Cody Parker go following his double-doink miss in the playoff loss to Philadelphia at Soldier Field. They ultimately went with Pineiro, and he just might be winning them over.\n\nHe nailed a 53-yard winner as time expired last week after hitting from 40 and 52 earlier in the game and is 4 for 4 this season. The big boot against the Broncos came after Nagy chose to go for a first down on fourth-and-10 in the opener against Green Bay at home rather than try a 51-yarder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to gain trust from them,\u201d Pineiro said. \u201cNow that he\u2019s seen me hit a couple 50-yarders, maybe he lets me try a few longer ones. So it\u2019s all a trust process. But we work for that moment behind the scenes at practice. Last-second kick, your team loses, we\u2019ve been doing this for the past four months now.\u201d\n\nSTILL NO REED\n\nThe Redskins hoped to get matchup nightmare tight end Jordan Reed back last week after being concussed Aug. 23. This is his fifth documented concussion in seven years, Reed didn\u2019t practice again Thursday and all possible caution being taken means he could miss the Bears game, too.\n\n\u201cThis is all a part of the process of recovering from this ordeal,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe\u2019re just taking it very slowly, making sure he goes through the right process to make sure it\u2019s right before he goes back on the field.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Andrew Seligman in Forest Park, Illinois, contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mitchell Trubisky wants the Bears to believe this will be the week their struggling offense gets going.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Whyno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/bears_broncos_football_41027_c0-139-3321-2075_s1770x1032.jpg?56e4457d2d64cdb4baf1b7995d091b8bb5a7064b", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
