Brand X (or just Brand X for short). And the court said the FCC cannot block states like California from writing their own net neutrality laws, so that\u2019s where the fight moves next.\n\nBut what really and truly stands out about the DC Circuit\u2019s decision in this case: net neutrality at the federal level has turned into a legal quagmire with almost no relationship to the real issues regular people face in the market for internet access.\n\nnet neutrality has turned into a legal quagmire with almost no relationship to regular people\n\nThe heart of the net neutrality policy debate is incredibly simple and easy for almost anyone to understand: do you think internet providers should have the power to block, throttle, or otherwise interfere with internet traffic outside of normal network management? Most people don\u2019t think so \u2014 the polls say net neutrality is a popular idea with Americans across party lines.\n\nBut because the fight has been going on for so long, and the rules have been imposed and taken away so many times under different legal theories, the actual court case and legal issues are a million miles away from the very simple policy question.\n\nInstead, the legal side of net neutrality has become an exercise in lawyers making fine-grained arguments about whether washing machines can make phone calls, whether consumers with a single broadband provider still experience the benefits of competition, and whether or not federal regulations can override state law if the federal regulations don\u2019t actually exist. \u201cIs it good if AT&T can throttle Fox News while streaming CNN for free\u201d never actually comes up, even though that is the fundamental policy question. It\u2019s deeply frustrating.\n\nBut it\u2019s also revealing, because it makes it abundantly clear that net neutrality needs to get away from lawyers and judges and be written into the actual law. And since the court ruled that individual states could pass their own net neutrality laws, it seems like that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going to happen.\n\nBut let\u2019s go through it \u2014 you can download a copy here to follow along.\n\nStill fighting the ghost of Antonin Scalia\n\nThe last 40 years of net neutrality history have mostly been a fight over whether the internet is an \u201cinformation service\u201d (like old-school \u201cwalled garden\u201d AOL or Prodigy, regulated under Title I) or a common carrier \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d (like landline telephones, regulated under Title II).\n\nThe major precedent here is the 2005 Brand X decision: the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that broadband internet was an \u201cinformation service.\u201d Brand X is also notable because it features a stinging dissent from the late ultraconsertive justice Antonin Scalia, who believed it was blindingly obvious that internet access was a telecommunications service. Brand X is the shadow over the entire net neutrality debate, and it seems clear that the DC Circuit feels bound by that precedent but thinks it ought to be revisited.\n\nRegardless of the legal history, it really does seems obvious to most people that broadband internet access is a telecommunications service that should be neutral. In this case, Ajit Pai and the FCC made the argument that broadband is actually an \u201cinformation service\u201d because access is paired with\u2026 DNS and caching services. That\u2019s DNS, as in the domain name lookup servers that translate domain names to IP addresses, and caching services that host copies of data closer to your location to speed up your access.\n\nNot email, not some wacky AOL chat room. DNS and caching. And because that argument worked in the 2005 Brand X case, the court in 2019 was obligated to say the FCC could use the same argument again.\n\nWe hold that classifying broadband Internet access as an \u201cinformation service\u201d based on the functionalities of DNS and caching is \u201c\u2018a reasonable policy choice for the [Commission] to make...\n\nThis contention \u2014 that ISPs offering DNS and caching are enough to turn straight broadband internet access into an \u201cinformation service\u201d \u2014 immediately forces the court into lengthy digressions and metaphors. Here\u2019s a long bit about how DNS is like invisible signs on the internet subway? I have no idea what this means.\n\nWhile DNS is \u201cinvisible\u201d in the sense that it is \u201cunder the hood,\u201d so to speak, it remains \u201cessential to providing Internet access for the ordinary consumer.\u201d Using a certain \u201cconfiguration\u201d tool or protocol might, say, make Internet traffic a bit faster or slower in the way that a metro\u2019s use of varying rail technologies might influence train speeds. But an absence of DNS would be something different altogether, hobbling ordinary users in navigating the Web, akin to a total absence of signage in a metro. Signage, unlike DNS, is of course quite apparent, but their user-centered purposes are alike for all practical purposes.\n\nOf course, you can always just use a different DNS service than the one your ISP gives you, ruining this already-dumb metaphor entirely, but the court doesn\u2019t really think about that.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the court saying that even though encrypted internet traffic (you know, like all HTTPS traffic) does not flow through ISP caching servers, it doesn\u2019t matter, because, um, the FCC says so.\n\nThe Commission found (without contradiction in the record) that caching \u201cenables and enhances consumers\u2019 access to and use of information online.\u201d In particular, \u201c[t]he record reflects that without caching, broadband Internet access service would be a significantly inferior experience for the consumer, particularly for customers in remote areas, requiring additional time and network capacity for retrieval of information from the Internet.\u201d That is so, the Commission maintains, even though encrypted traffic does not use caching, because \u201ctruly pervasive encryption on the Internet is still a long way off and many sites still do not encrypt.\u201d\n\nSo even though there\u2019s a widespread industry push towards HTTPS encryption \u2014 73 percent of all internet traffic is now encrypted \u2014 the simple presence of ISP caching servers means that broadband is an \u201cinformation service.\u201d That doesn\u2019t make much sense, since an ISP simply providing DNS servers (which you do not have to use) and caching (which is irrelevant to any HTTPS connection) is obviously not enough to turn your broadband connection into the equivalent of Prodigy in 1998.\n\nThe court addresses this argument, saying that DNS and caching were deemed to be information services in Brand X, and it\u2019s not going to overturn that precedent. It just does so using a metaphor about, um, weaving sweaters with golden thread:\n\nThe idea seems to be that ISPs now offer fewer \u201cwalled garden\u201d services of the kind consumers mostly care about than they did in the era of the 2002 Cable Modem Order and Brand X, so that basing an \u201cinformation service\u201d designation on DNS and caching alone is currently as dubious as saying that a few golden threads interwoven in an ordinary sweater turn the sweater into a golden garment\u2026 But the Supreme Court has never imposed or even hinted at such a quantitative standard to determine whether inextricably intertwined functionalities can justify an \u201cinformation service\u201d classification.\n\nThis is not hard to understand: does offering DNS and caching turn your Comcast connection into an \u201cinformation service\u201d like dial-up AOL in 1998? No reasonable person would think so, but that\u2019s Ajit Pai\u2019s argument, and he\u2019s got the Brand X decision in his back pocket, so he won. Again, this is a legal victory, not a logical one.\n\nLandlines and washing machines\n\nThe court next addresses whether mobile broadband is a \u201ccommercial mobile service,\u201d which is the wireless version of a telecommunications service, or a \u201cprivate mobile service,\u201d which is the analogue to an information service. I will spare you the details of the long, long discussion that follows, except to say the state of telecom law in 2019 is such that the court winds up making its decision based on the fact that smart washing machines cannot make phone calls.\n\nYou think I\u2019m joking.\n\nThe proliferation of \u201csmart\u201d devices with IP addresses, such as \u201cservers, thermostats, washing machines, and scores of other devices in the Internet of Things,\u201d threatened such a definition with a new complication. If those devices were part of the public switched network, it might yield the dubious upshot that mobile voice would no longer be a commercial mobile service because its subscribers could not interconnect with \u201call\u201d endpoints on the network, \u201csuch as IP-enabled televisions, washing machines, and thermostats, and other smart devices\u201d incapable of voice communications. The entire mobile broadband argument is about whether mobile devices can connect to phone numbers!\n\nIf you thought that was nonsensical, just try to figure out what on earth this chunk of words about VoIP means:\n\nThe proliferation of VoIP and prevalence of its use are orthogonal to the Commission\u2019s point about the relationship between mobile broadband and VoIP . Whether VoIP applications are used by many users or few, and whether they are preinstalled or acquired on an ad hoc basis, the question is whether VoIP functionalities are part of the service at issue here\u2014mobile broadband service\u2014or constitute other services that mobile broadband allows users to access.\n\nI just want to reiterate that the fundamental question here is \u201cshould mobile broadband providers be able to block and throttle internet traffic\u201d and somehow the court has been sidetracked into nonsensical arguments about whether the availability of VoIP services that connect to the phone system determines the answer.\n\nOh but we\u2019re not done \u2014 let\u2019s go ahead and enter a linguistics debate about the definitions of \u201capplications\u201d and \u201cservices.\u201d\n\nNone of the parties identifies (and we have not found) either a set of regulatory definitions purporting to draw lines between \u201capplications\u201d and \u201cservices,\u201d or a set of generally accepted linguistic practices drawing such a line or generally governing when the capability of apps that are usable with a service should be taken to belong to the \u201ccapabilities\u201d of the service.\n\nI would love to see AT&T send this language out to a customer irritated that CNN streams for free on their data plan but Fox News does not.\n\nThe court then tries to make this upside-down nonsense clearer by making up a fake conversation that absolutely no human beings would ever have in reality.\n\nIf someone tells a friend, \u201cI just got a great new tablet with mobile broadband,\u201d it would hardly be a solecism for the friend to reply, \u201cGreat\u2014 does your service let me reach you from my landline?\u201d Of course the new tablet owner might reply, \u201cNot now\u2014but it could if I set up a Google Voice number,\u201d but that only shows the linguistic ambiguity.\n\nI have read this rejected spec script for a Verizon commercial over and over, and it just gets funnier and sadder all at once every time.\n\nMonopolies: they\u2019re great\n\nMoving on, the court addresses the fact that the US broadband market suffers from a lack of competition, and concludes that actually there\u2019s enough competition even for people who only have one choice of broadband provider. Seriously!\n\nWe are, however, satisfied by the Commission\u2019s other reasons for believing that competition exists in the broadband market. The Commission turns to empirical research that supports the claim that the presence of two wireline providers is enough to ensure that meaningful competition exists. Consumers in areas with fewer than two providers may also reap the benefits of competition; a provider in this area \u201cwill tend to treat customers that do not have a competitive choice as if they do\u201d because competitive pressures elsewhere \u201coften have spillover effects across a given corporation.\u201d\n\nThis is just blindingly, obviously not true \u2014 if it were, everyone would love the prices and services they get from the competitive ISP industry in America. Instead Americans pay more for slower speeds than most other countries. I would love to see this judge go tell the millions of people begging for better broadband in rural areas that they are actually \u201creaping the benefits of competition.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t worry about that lack of competition anyway, the court says: if ISPs do bad things, they\u2019ll shape up because of the damage to their reputations.\n\nAdditionally, these providers could face hefty operational and reputational cost from acting badly in uncompetitive areas. Based on these reasonable findings and our highly deferential standard of review, it was not arbitrary for the Commission to conclude that fixed broadband providers face competitive pressures.\n\nI just want to be clear that the court is saying AT&T and Verizon and Comcast and Spectrum are caring, smart companies that will do the right thing because they are so worried about their reputations. That\u2019s a nice idea, but here in the real world everyone hates their ISPs more than ever. Verizon throttled the connections of firefighters during a wildfire, which is maybe the most obvious way to damage your reputation possible. And AT&T is busily gutting HBO through layoffs and talent attrition even as activist investors point out its executives are bad at their jobs.\n\nThese companies are behemoths with virtually no competition, and they routinely act like it, because we\u2019re stuck with them.\n\nI won\u2019t make anyone slog through the very technical legal arguments about whether the FCC can override state laws, except to say that the court was not very impressed with the FCC\u2019s argument that it has the implied authority to do so, and was pretty snippy about it.\n\nIf Congress wanted Title I to vest the Commission with some form of Dormant-Commerce-Clause-like power to negate States\u2019 statutory (and sovereign) authority just by washing its hands of its own regulatory authority, Congress could have said so.\n\nThe whole opinion wraps up by essentially begging either the states or Congress to write a law, which, frankly, is what should happen. (And indeed, the House has passed the popular Save the Internet Act, but the Senate won\u2019t take it up, while states across the country have passed their own net neutrality bills.)\n\nRegulation of broadband Internet has been the subject of protracted litigation, with broadband providers subjected to and then released from common carrier regulation over the previous decade. We decline to yet again flick the on-off switch of common-carrier regulation under these circumstances.\n\nSo that\u2019s the main, unsigned opinion. But I just want to point out that the two signed supplementary opinions are equally bonkers. For example, Judge Stephen Williams wrote an opinion that concurs in part and dissents in part, but the only thing you really need to know about it is that it starts with a quote from Macbeth:\n\nAnd be these juggling fiends no more believed, That palter with us in a double sense; That keep the word of promise to our ear, And break it to our hope. So says Macbeth, finding that the witches\u2019 assurances were sheer artifice and that his life is collapsing around him. The enactors of the 2018 Order, though surely no Macbeths, might nonetheless feel a certain kinship, being told that they acted lawfully in rejecting the heavy hand of Title II for the Internet, but that each of the 50 states is free to impose just that.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd Judge Patricia Millet wrote an opinion that is listed as a concurrence, since she agrees that the court is bound by the Brand X decision, but every other part of it is a stinging rebuke of the terrible majority opinion. But it is also written as dramatically as possible.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s decision to cling to DNS and caching as the acid test for its regulatory classification \u201ccannot bear very much reality.\u201d Today, the typical broadband offering bears little resemblance to its Brand X version. The walled garden has been razed and its fields sown with salt.\n\nThat quote in the first sentence is footnoted to T.S. Eliot, so don\u2019t worry, this whole thing remains as extra as ever. But I think Judge Millet has one thing right: Antonin Scalia had this nailed in 2005, and we\u2019ve been paying for the bad Brand X decision ever since.\n\nNot only does the walled garden lay in ruin, but the roles of DNS and caching themselves have changed dramatically since Brand X was decided. And they have done so in ways that strongly favor classifying broadband as a telecommunications service, as Justice Scalia had originally advocated.\n\nThe more I read this decision, the more it\u2019s clear that the legal machinations and overwrought decisions based on a single bad precedent are getting farther and farther away from the realities of internet access for regular people. This decision might get appealed, and Brand X might get overturned, but it\u2019s well past time for net neutrality to leave the world of endless court challenges and legal trivialities, and just become the law.\n\nAnd at the very least, it appears this ridiculous decision opens the door for states like California to do just that.", "description": "Reading the court\u2019s decision that allowed the FCC to kill net neutrality reveals that the debate is far removed from reality", "authors": ["Nilay Patel", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NX81NQUGMsPZ_J28J9PLGYo1Am8=/0x159:1000x683/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19259725/washingmachine.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
