Between the HBO Max news and AT&T\u2019s earnings the day before, next week is the biggest week of the year for the owners of AT&T stock.\n\nWhat to Expect From AT&T\u2019s Earnings\n\nBefore the HBO Max event, on Monday AT&T will release its third-quarter earnings. Analysts, on average, are calling for earnings per share of 93 cents on revenue of $45 billion. That revenue figure would represent a 1.6% sales decline from the same period last year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe owners of AT&T stock will be watching the company\u2019s subscriber numbers. It\u2019s been about three years since AT&T broke the bank by buying Time Warner for $85 billion. Unfortunately, since the end of 2016, AT&T\u2019s premium video subscriber count has been steadily declining. Premium video includes both DirecTV and U-Verse video subscribers. Total subscriber count has dropped from 25.3 million in Q4 of 2016 to just 21.6 million in Q2 of 2019.\n\nLast quarter, AT&T reported 778,000 premium video subscriber losses and 168,000 DirecTV subscriber losses. That was even worse than the 627,000 net losses AT&T reported in Q1.\n\nNext week, the owners of T stock will be looking to see if those subscriber losses continued to accelerate in Q3.\n\nIn November, AT&T is raising the price of AT&T TV Now by $15 per month to $65. Investors are hoping this price hike will increase T\u2019s average revenue per user without hurting its subscription numbers too badly.\n\nHBO Max\n\nBut the biggest event of next week for AT&T stock owners will probably not be its earnings. That\u2019s because, on Tuesday AT&T will hold its long-awaited HBO Max investor event. In fact, this event is so important that it\u2019s likely the reason AT&T postponed its earnings report for one week.\n\nAccording to various reports and analysts, AT&T will charge between $15 and $17 per month for HBO Max. However, Bank of America analyst David Barden says AT&T may try to out-Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) Netflix when it comes to pricing. For years, Netflix lured consumers to its service by charging much less than cable TV.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarden says AT&T may charge just $10 per month for HBO Max. That price would undercut Netflix\u2019s standard plan, which costs $13 per month. It\u2019s certainly not a crazy price, considering Disney+ will start at just $7 per month.\n\nAT&T could follow Netflix\u2019s model and ignore margins for the first couple of years in favor of attracting more subscribers. Unlike Netflix, AT&T has enough cash flow to absorb those losses.\n\nBarden says the subscription service will initially cost AT&T between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. However, the telecom giant may have a few tricks up its sleeve to mitigate those losses.\n\n\u201cTo help offset some of the drag, we believe AT&T could shut down the AT&T TV Now (formerly DirecTV Now platform) and update synergy expectations from the Time Warner integration (back office benefits from putting together the three silos),\u201d Barden says.\n\nBarden says AT&T will also likely placate the owners of AT&T stock by offsetting the earnings per share drag with buybacks of T stock.\n\n\u201cTo help offset some of the cost drag at the EPS line, we believe AT&T will initiate an $8-$10bn stock buyback program,\u201d he says.\n\nInvestors will also learn more about HBO Max\u2019s content, potential bundles/promotions and an international roll-out plan.", "description": "There has been plenty of fanfare surrounding the new Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) streaming service set to launch next month.
