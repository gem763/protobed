He noted that the 66-year-old Epstein had two fractures on the left and right sides of his larynx, specifically the thyroid cartilage or Adam\u2019s apple, as well as one fracture on the left hyoid bone above the Adam\u2019s apple, Baden told Fox News.\n\n\u201cThose three fractures are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation,\u201d Baden, who is also a Fox News contributor, said.\n\nWhile there\u2019s not enough information to be conclusive yet, the three fractures were \u201crare,\u201d said Baden, who\u2019s probed cases involving O.J. Simpson, President John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, record producer Phil Spector, New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez and many others.", "description": "", "authors": ["Fox News", "Foxnews.Com Us Forensic-Pathologist-Jeffrey-Epstein-Homicide-Suicide"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
