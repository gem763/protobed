But few moderates are willing to abandon their more radical comrades.\n\nEven by the standards of Hong Kong\u2019s summer of rage, the last fortnight has been brutal.\n\nAfter months of focusing their anger towards police, local government and symbols of Beijing\u2019s rule, hardcore protesters went on an unprecedented city-wide vandalism spree after the city\u2019s leader invoked emergency powers to ban face masks.\n\nThe subway system \u2014 viewed as an enemy for ferrying police and shuttering stations \u2014 was crippled, with some 2,400 ticketing machines and turnstiles vandalised alongside 900 CCTV cameras in 83 of the city\u2019s 94 metro stations.\n\nBusinesses perceived to be mainland-Chinese owned or Beijing loyalist were trashed with colour-coded lists detailing which companies were fair game and which should be left alone.\n\nAnd multiple clashes showed demonstrators beating their ideological opponents.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Red Guards\u2019? \u2013\n\nIn one incident, a Chinese JP Morgan employee was punched in the face as a crowd shouted \u201cGo home!\u201d. In another, a man who tried to stop protesters defacing a Chinese flag was repeatedly assaulted.\n\nA movement initially founded on defending Hong Kong\u2019s independent judiciary from the authoritarian mainland was now increasingly meting out street justice.\n\nThe scenes have provoked debate on the online forums used to organise the largely leaderless protests.\n\nOne post \u2014 which received more than 9,000 upvotes \u2014 asked whether radicals were going after the wrong targets.\n\n\u201cContinuing to escalate vandalism will only help public opinions on the opposite side and lose our support from international community,\u201d the author wrote, fretting that radicals risked being seen as a new iteration of Mao\u2019s violent \u201cRed Guards\u201d.\n\nAt a press conference on Friday night, anonymous protesters hinted at concerns some of the violence might be counter-productive.\n\n\u201cI hope fellow companions will not be controlled by hatred,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nBut there was little let up in the chaos Sunday with more vandalism and fights erupting across the city.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping said during a state visit to Nepal that any attempts to split China would result in \u201cbodies smashed and bones ground to powder\u201d.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Government the culprit\u2019 \u2013\n\nYet the violence appears to have done little to dent mainstream support.\n\nPolitical analyst Dixon Sing said this was because neither Beijing nor Hong Kong\u2019s government have given protesters any incentives to de-escalate after four months of wielding a stick and offering few carrots.\n\n\u201cThe majority of Hong Kong people still feel the major culprit remains the collusion between the Beijing government and the Hong Kong government and the police,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe increase in violence of the police has been a major factor in not detracting the overall support for the protesters, including those increasingly militant and violent attacks,\u201d he added.\n\nPolice have certainly matched protesters for zeal, firing nearly 2,000 tear gas canisters over a single week earlier this month, compared to just 1,000 in the first two months.\n\nTwo teenagers were also shot and wounded with live rounds during melees with protesters, while an AFP journalist filmed an officer throwing a heavy rubbish bin from a bridge onto fleeing demonstrators.\n\nA phrase commonly adopted by protesters roughly translates to \u201cwe will not sever ties\u201d pushing the idea the movement must remain unified \u2014 even if people disagree over tactics.\n\n\u201cEven if we\u2019re not in full support of what they do, at least we try to show some sympathy and understanding,\u201d said Claudia Mo, a veteran pro-democracy lawmaker who advocates non-violence.\n\n\u2013 \u2018They saved us\u2019 \u2013\n\nBonnie Leung \u2014 who helped organise the mass protests earlier this summer that were ignored by Hong Kong\u2019s government \u2014 said many moderates felt gratitude to the movement\u2019s radical wing, who are dubbed \u201cthe braves\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll protesters are indebted to the braves as without them the bill would have been passed,\u201d she said, referencing a now scrapped plan to allow extraditions to China, the catalyst for the initial protests before they snowballed into a wider democracy and police accountability movement.\n\n\u201cThere are discussions on the strategies though, whether the escalation is leading anywhere, and whether some actions should be stopped,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cWe have doubts, we discuss, we try to convince, but we are still united and still don\u2019t split.\u201d\n\nJohn, a self-described moderate protester in his forties, explained why he and his middle-class family still supported \u201cthe braves\u201d as he ate McDonalds with his nine-year-old son.\n\n\u201cThey saved this movement and are taking all the risks,\u201d he said, asking to only use his first name. \u201cWe have to be there for them now.\u201d", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Hong Kong\u2019s more hardline pro-democracy protesters have embraced increased violence towards private property, businesses and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/1895e3_movement-initially-founded-on-defending-hong-kong-independent-judiciary-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
