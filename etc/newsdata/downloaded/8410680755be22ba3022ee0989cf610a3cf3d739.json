We literally have great generals like Mattis, who sit on the world stage, the United States of America, there can be no better friend than the United States of America and no greater enemy than the United States of America.

We cannot allow Russia to not only interfere in the democracies of the Ukraine and Latvia, Lithuania, but even not calling them out in their efforts to interfere in this democracy are unacceptable.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "During Tuesday's CNN-New York Times\u00a0Democratic debate, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
