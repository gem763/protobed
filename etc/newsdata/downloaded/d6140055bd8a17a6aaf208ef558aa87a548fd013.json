(Doug Mills/The New York Times)\n\nDAVENPORT, Iowa \u2014 Kristy Schneeberger, a Democrat in eastern Iowa, said it was about time that Democrats in Congress moved to impeach President Donald Trump. \u201cNo one is above the law,\u201d she said.\n\nBut for Schneeberger and many other Democratic voters around the country, the prospect of an explosive impeachment battle in Washington also left them nervous. They worried that impeachment could easily backfire on Democrats, galvanizing Trump\u2019s supporters in next year\u2019s elections and drowning out people\u2019s concerns about health care, immigration and the economy.\n\nGun control is a top priority for Schneeberger, 60, because her four adult children, ages 26 to 37, are teachers worried about their students\u2019 safety. But now, she said, \u201cI think it\u2019s just getting sidelined again.\u201d\n\nWhile politicians in Washington crowded microphones Wednesday to condemn or defend Trump and the prospect of his impeachment, more than two dozen voters across the country were by turns elated and wary, unsure and already exhausted, at the idea of an impeachment investigation that could consume the nation for months.\n\nRepublican supporters of Trump, as well as some moderates who had crossed over to vote for him in 2016, were generally unmoved by the possibility that Trump committed impeachable crimes. The new impeachment inquiry led by House Democratic leaders, they said, was just one more overblown political crisis that Trump could weather and use to rally his base in 2020.\n\n\u201cI think it is an absolute joke,\u201d said Reggie Dickerson, 54, a pipe fitter and timber worker who lives in eastern Kentucky.\n\nDickerson and other supporters said they had stuck with Trump during the special-counsel investigation of Russian election-meddling and collusion, throughout revelations about hush-money payments to an adult film star and even during the release of Trump\u2019s vulgar comments on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tapes. The latest details about what Trump said to Ukraine\u2019s president had not changed their minds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, yeah, boy who cried wolf,\u201d said Donna Burgraff, an associate education professor and registered independent from Andersonville, Tennessee, who voted for Barack Obama in 2008 before swinging to Trump. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have something big, and I haven\u2019t seen something big.\u201d\n\nFor years, polling has shown that a majority of Americans have opposed impeaching Trump and considered it a theoretical topic that mattered less than real-life concerns like health care and job creation. Whether that will change, and what happens if it doesn\u2019t, are some of many factors that will shape the political consequences for both parties.\n\nIn interviews with voters Wednesday, there was no clear or surprising shift in sentiment on impeachment; some Republican voters pumped their fists with bring-it-on energy, and some Democrats pronounced themselves vindicated but also uncertain about whether the House \u2014 let alone the Republican-led Senate \u2014 would ultimately act against Trump.\n\nStill, some Democratic voters said the symbolism of the moment and the prospect of monthslong televised hearings into Trump\u2019s conduct were satisfying enough. In Seattle, Zera Marvel hung an orange flag declaring \u201cIMPEACH\u201d from her front porch Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe actually need someone to put their foot down,\u201d she said.\n\nIn states like Iowa, where voters have been deluged by presidential candidates this year, Democratic voters said that while they believed impeachment was warranted, they were also concerned the issue would swallow up everything else and potentially tarnish former Vice President Joe Biden if he is the nominee, in a replay of the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server that dragged down her candidacy for president in 2016.\n\n\u201cIf they prolong it into next year in July and August, when we\u2019re in the heart of the conventions, that bothers me,\u201d said Kevin Hansen, a farmer in Jackson County, south of Dubuque. \u201cI\u2019m just afraid that with the way Trump can flip the issues all the time, that this will come back to bite. Or there might be something else that turns up that may not be so favorable to Joe Biden if he\u2019s the nominee.\u201d\n\nWhile some Democratic voters said Trump had abused his power by pressing Ukraine\u2019s leader for an investigation of Biden, Republican voters largely dismissed the new details that poured out of Washington on Wednesday. \u201cA nothingburger,\u201d said Michael Bower, 38, of Seattle.", "description": "DAVENPORT, Iowa -- Kristy Schneeberger, a Democrat in eastern Iowa, said it was about time that Democrats in Congress moved to impeach President Donald Trump. \"No one is above the law,\" she said.But for Schneeberger and many other Democratic voters around the country, the prospect of an explosive", "authors": ["Trip Gabriel", "Jack Healy", "Sabrina Tavernise"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eXcwutnPNhz3Zs26V_YunA--~B/aD0yMzg0O3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/df4efdb65dcaa9dc65c9da05bdf1f212", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
