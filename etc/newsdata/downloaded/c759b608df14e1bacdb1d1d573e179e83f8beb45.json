He recalled a speech in 2006 from then Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke who also minimized the curve\u2019s predictive powers.\n\n\u201cThe idea has always been to downplay this issue,\u201d Bullard said. \u201cIf you want to ignore the signal, you should say, okay, but I\u2019m ignoring it with open eyes.\u201d\n\nThe yield on the 10-year TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.06% is currently a bit higher than the 2-year TMUBMUSD02Y, -2.29% , at 1.73% versus 1.59%. Earlier in the year, the 2-year yield was higher than the 10-year.\n\nBullard, who wanted a half percentage point rate cut in September, continued to press the case for easier policy.\n\n\u201cInsurance rate cuts may help re-center inflation and inflation expectations at the 2% target sooner than otherwise,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Fed is meeting at the end of October to determine whether it will make its third quarter-point rate cut in succession this year.\n\nAsked by MarketWatch, he declined to quantify a probability of recession and acknowledged that most estimates of them are based off the yield curve.\n\nHe also said uncertainty about international trade policies is likely to linger for longer than markets anticipate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve opened a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you study the history of trade negotiations, they\u2019re very long and very involved over a very long period of time.\u201d", "description": "There are a lot of valid reasons why the inversion of the yield curve \u2014 that is, the yield of short-term bonds being higher than that of longer-term...", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT291_bullar_ZG_20191015065152.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
