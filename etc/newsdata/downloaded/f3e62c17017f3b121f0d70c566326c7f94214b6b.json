And he\u2019s a congressman from Alabama named Mo Brooks. But I kept hearing Mel Brooks,\u201d Toobin stated. \u201cI mean, this whole spectacle yesterday seemed like something out of a Mel Brooks movie. You know, this protest to be allowed inside when many of the members of the protest were actually members of the committee. They could have walked in at any point.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a sign of desperation. You know, they captured a news cycle. But I don\u2019t know what good that news cycle did them, because they looked like such jerks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. You thought Mel Brooks, I thought an episode of \u2018Veep,'\u201d Golodryga replied.\n\nShe added, \u201cI mean, it really looked like a stunt. And you saw a handful of women. Other than that you saw a bunch of white men. And I just thought to myself, this is not what America looks like right now. Right? And so I don\u2019t know what the point is they were trying to make by storming this hearing. Serious issues, serious ramifications are coming out of what we\u2019re hearing from the people who are testifying, who are life-long diplomats that have served this country. And this is what follows. And it comes as you said, two days after the president said that Republicans need to fight harder.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "CNN's \"New Day\" on Thursday discussed the House members of the GOP the day before successfully storming and\u00a0shutting down a House Intelligence Committee | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/CNN-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
