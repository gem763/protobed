(ABC) were expected to show current news stories with most of the words blacked out.\n\nThe protest was designed to put public pressure on the government to exempt journalists from laws restricting access to sensitive information, enact a properly functioning freedom of information system, and raise the benchmark for defamation lawsuits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about defending the basic right of every Australian to be properly informed about the important decisions the government is making in their name,\u201d Nine CEO Hugh Marks said in a statement.\n\nNews Corp (NWSA.O) Australasia executive chairman Michael Miller said people \u201cshould always be suspicious of governments that want to restrict their right to know what\u2019s going on\u201d.\n\nAustralia has no constitutional safeguards for free speech. The government added a provision to protect whistleblowers when it strengthened counter-espionage laws in 2018, although media organisations say press freedoms remain restricted.\n\nGlobal attention turned to media freedoms in Australia this year when a court order prevented media from reporting that the former Vatican treasurer, Cardinal George Pell, had been found guilty on child sex abuse charges.\n\nSome Australian outlets reported that an unidentified person had been convicted but some foreign media companies identified Pell because they were outside Australia\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nProsecutors are now seeking fines and jail sentences for three dozen Australian journalists and publishers for their coverage of the trial. Pell is appealing against his convictions.\n\nThe subject came to a boil again in June when police raided the head office of the ABC in Sydney and the home of a News Corp editor on suspicion of receiving national secrets.\n\nThe raids, which involved police examination of about 9,000 computer files at the ABC and sifting through the female News Corp editor\u2019s underwear drawer, drew international condemnation.\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation called the raids \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d.\n\nThe ABC said at the time the raid on its office was in relation to 2017 stories about accusations of military misconduct in Afghanistan. News Corp has said the raid on its employee concerned an article about government plans to spy on Australians\u2019 emails, text messages and bank accounts.\n\nUnder intense pressure, the government issued a directive to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in September that will require permission from Attorney General Christian Porter to approve any charges against journalists.", "description": "Australia's biggest newspapers were expected to run front pages on Monday made up to appear heavily redacted to protest against recent legislation that restricts press freedoms, a rare show of unity by the usually tribal media industry.", "authors": ["Colin Packham", "Byron Kaye", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
