If for any reason they come back to our country, we will go wherever they are and use power the likes of which the United States has never used before \u2014 and I\u2019m not talking about nuclear power. They will never have seen anything like what will happen to them.\u201d\n\nTrump, a New Yorker, also recalled his own experience of the World Trade Center attacks, saying he went down to the wreckage afterwards to help.\n\n\u201cIt was then that I realized the world was going to change. It was no longer going to be, and it could never ever be that innocent place that I thought it was,\u201d he said of watching the towers burn on television. \u201cSoon after, I went down to Ground Zero with men who worked for me to try to help in any little way that we could. We were not alone.\u201d\n\nThe president and First Lady also held a moment of silence on the South Lawn of the White House at 8:46 a.m., the moment the first plane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "President Trump honored the memory of the victims on the 18th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks Wednesday by sending a grim warning to the Taliban terrorist group, which claimed responsibility for the death of an American soldier last week.\"For every American who lived through", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Q5kKzKEOTZZLJ63TdcDiZg--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/85624fca912b945685ac1c751bc228aa"}
