That's not even how we think about that,\" he said.\n\n\"If decoupling was actually the practice, what you would see on a day-to-day basis would be fundamentally different than what you see.\"\n\nWhat the United States is trying to do is \"rebalance and right relationships to ensure that we have equity,\" Sbragia, who is leading the U.S. delegation to the forum, added.\n\nBoth countries want to enhance stability and deepen their relationship to reinforce crisis avoidance, he said.\n\n\"It's just the opposite of decoupling. It's not to pull apart. It's actually to in some ways deepen those relationships.\"\n\nThe United States and China have bickered over other areas, including the disputed South China Sea and Chinese-claimed Taiwan, with Beijing especially nervous about U.S. military activity in what it views as China's backyard.\n\nSbragia said Washington wanted an open, free and inclusive Indo-Pacific region based on certain principles, including peaceful resolution of disputes, freedom of navigation and overflight, and fair trade and investment.\n\n\"Our treaty alliances in the Indo Pacific are not maintained as a relic of Cold War thinking, as some contend, but are manifestations of our enduring commitment to ensuring our allies and partners are secure in their sovereignty,\" he added.\n\n\"Our inclusive vision extends to China as well. Competition with China does mean conflict, and the United States will not ask any country to choose between Washington and Beijing. That's not how the logic of our framework, our approach, is set.\" (Reporting by Ben Blanchard Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "description": "By Ben BlanchardBEIJING, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The United States is not seeking  to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
