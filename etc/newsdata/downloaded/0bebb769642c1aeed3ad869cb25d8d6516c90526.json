Let me guess: sneakers. Maybe a pair of collectible, cartoonishly colored Nike s? Leather Common Projects lace-ups in minimalist, office-friendly white? Or some humbly ho-hum navy-blue wool Allbirds? You weren\u2019t alone. The sneaker business hit $44 billion in sales last year in the U.S., up 9% from the year before, according to market-research firm the NPD Group.\n\nAlthough the modern sneaker era arguably began with Nike\u2019s first running shoes\u2014the basic Cortez\u2014around 50 years ago, today that type of functionally athletic sneaker is not driving the growing market. Matt Powell, the senior industry adviser for sports at the NPD Group, noted that sales of performance-sport sneakers (for running, basketball, tennis, etc.) are tapering off. \u201cFor the last four years we\u2019ve been in this period where we do not have a single performance [shoe] trending positively,\u201d he said. Why pay for state-of-the-art, air-bubbled high-tops if you\u2019re not Steph Curry lining up to take a three?\n\nSimpler sneakers are on the upswing. \u201cRetro definitely has a bit more of the momentum,\u201d said Erik Fagerlind, the co-owner of Sneakersnstuff, a global chain of sneaker boutiques. Tasteful throwbacks, like the reissued Nike Tailwind, Adidas Superstar (see \u201cOs\u201d above) and upscale traditional sneakers like Spalwart\u2019s Marathon Trail Runner and Brunello Cucinelli \u2019s luxe suede low-tops appeal to a clientele who came of age in the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s. For Frankie Walker Jr., the co-owner of Unknwn, a Miami sneaker retailer, and a child of the \u201980s, the sneakers of one\u2019s youth hold nostalgic charm. A plus? These clean styles won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\n\nAnother sneaker that blends well with business-casual garb is the understated, sustainable kick as epitomized by the knitted-upper runner from direct-to-consumer startup Allbirds (\u201cDs\u201d above) or the subtle shoes from French label Veja (\u201cSs\u201d above). At a time of staggering clothing waste, these shoes attempt to tread more lightly on the environment.\n\nAt the opposite end of the style spectrum, aggressively trendy sneakers are rife in the Instagram age. Statement shoes like Balenciaga\u2019s colossally chunky Triple-S or Nike\u2019s collaboration with Japan\u2019s Sacai (with its double soles and double tongues) leap out on social media, where brash sneaker fans of all ages battle for bragging rights. The thirst for boast-worthy shoes has supercharged sneaker collecting. On resale platforms like Stadium Goods, StockX and Flight Club, obsessives amass and unload limited pairs, sometimes at hammer prices well into the five figures. In July an entrepreneur paid $850,000 for a set of 99 rare sneakers during a Sotheby\u2019s sale.\n\nOf course, most of us are just looking for one everyday pair. For many, it\u2019s a low-key minimalist sneaker, but even if you\u2019d never wear Technicolor Nikes (\u201cNi\u201d above), they can be fun to look at.\n\nTIES NOT OPTIONAL Off Duty\u2019s deputy fashion director wears hertrusty New Balances with a directional C\u00e9line dress. Photo: Ryan Mesina/The Wall Street Journal\n\nCan sneakers be stylish?\n\nFashion editor Rebecca Malinsky willed them to be following a debilitating foot injury.\n\nAT A CLOSE FRIEND\u2019S wedding in the Portuguese countryside a while back, I danced until the wee hours in a predictably picturesque setting. The next day, however, my right foot was aching. After the seven-hour flight home and a long walk through customs I knew something was not right. Three podiatrists, two MRIs and one renowned foot and ankle surgeon later, I discovered that I had boogied my way to a rather serious ankle injury that would simply require time and supportive (read: ugly) shoes to heal. Time? Sure. But trading ballerina flats for the same sneakers as my dad?\n\nThe accident humbled me into accepting the fragility of the human body\u2014in the painfully conspicuous form of orthopedic shoes. I spent about 18 months solely wearing running shoes, minus the three hours I devoted to getting married in 1-inch Valentino heels lined with Dr. Scholl\u2019s pads (fighting back tears from the pain and the emotion of it all).\n\nPhysically, just getting from point A to B has been exhausting; mentally, trying to remain confident as a fashion authority in sensible sneakers has been taxing. In the time I\u2019ve spent in my go-to pairs of shoes\u2014a gray New Balance 990 and a black Asics GT-1000\u2014I\u2019ve had to get creative to make them feel like they are truly a part of my personal style. But along the way, I developed the following guidelines on how to style sneakers fashionably:\n\nDon\u2019t dress down. Sneakers look more considered and intentional when paired with trendy clothing vs. basics. Try a slouchy linen pant or floral dress instead of jeans.\n\nSneakers look more considered and intentional when paired with trendy clothing vs. basics. Try a slouchy linen pant or floral dress instead of jeans. Consider the classics. Many designer sneakers are inspired by traditional tennis, or running, shoe brands. Scout out the original: It looks more authentic and saves you hundreds of dollars.\n\nMany designer sneakers are inspired by traditional tennis, or running, shoe brands. Scout out the original: It looks more authentic and saves you hundreds of dollars. Venture manward. Why are women\u2019s sneakers always fuchsia and teal?

Learn your sizes in men\u2019s sneakers to get the more-interesting lime green/black or red/white/tan combinations. Socks matter. They should match your outfit, not your shoe. Invest in no-show peds for summer, and some gray, textured wool tall socks for the cooler months.\n\nCATWALK CHALLENGERS Sneakers have made several cameos on the runway over the past few decades.

Two years later, Adidas joined forces with the Japanese master Yohji Yamamoto on Y-3, an extensive line of sneakers and clothing that still exists today. With its emphasis on spare design and technological performance, Y3 has been a vanguard in a landscape crowded with collaborations between athletic companies and designers.\n\nThese collabs haven\u2019t prevented fashion houses from trying their own kicks. In 2006, Lanvin introduced what many consider to be the first noncollaborative designer sneaker\u2014a cap-toed lace-up somewhere between a tuxedo slipper and a tennis plimsoll. Luxury labels from Prada to Louis Vuitton would follow in Lanvin\u2019s footsteps. Today, Sam Lobban, vice president of men\u2019s fashion at Nordstrom, noted that Dior, Balenciaga and Fendi sneakers are all popular options. Yet, collaborative efforts between fashion labels and sportswear companies persist. Reebok has recruited rising New York label Pyer Moss, while Adidas works with Belgian designer Raf Simons and London\u2019s Craig Green. Yet it is Nike\u2019s partnerships with 1017 Alyx 9SM designer Matthew Williams, Sacai\u2019s Chitose Abe and Off-White designer Virgil Abloh that have yielded some of this year\u2019s most sought-after sneakers, which fetch many times their retail price on the secondary market.\n\nA CLEANER SNEAKER?

These upstarts could potentially loosen their grip.\n\nWHILE NIKE and Adidas remain the dual titans of the sneaker industry, viable alternatives are on the rise. \u201cSmall brands are really growing much faster than the large brands,\u201d said Matt Powell, the senior industry adviser for sports at market research firm the NPD Group. He pointed to classic but relatively unsung labels like Fila, Puma and Reebok that not only feed into the retro trend, but also serve as an antidote to Nike-and-Adidas overload.\n\nAnother factor that could threaten the status quo: the startups that frame themselves as the Warby Parker-esque disrupters of the sneaker world. Most visible is Allbirds\u2014whose $95 merino-wool sneaker (the self-proclaimed \u201cworld\u2019s most comfortable shoe\u201d) has inspired a think piece in the New Yorker. In January the San Francisco brand was valued at $1.4 billion. Labels like Greats and Atoms also sell sleek direct-to-consumer sneakers. \u201cThey offer a bit more of a value because they\u2019ve taken the middleman out of the equation,\u201d said Mr. Powell.\n\nAllbirds\u2019s wool runners and Veja\u2019s trainers, both pitched as being good for the environment, appeal to consumers hoping to make virtuous choices. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of social meaning that we already infuse into our footwear,\u201d said Bata Shoe Museum senior curator Elizabeth Semmelhack.\n\nThat said, the big brands are no slouches in this department, either: Nike has been one of the more responsible apparel giants when it comes to using recycled materials.\n\nZOOM SHOES Hoka One One Rincon, $115, hokaoneone.com; Salomon S/LABXT-4ADV, $223, havenshop.com Photo: Bryan Gardner for the Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nTrail Runners Take Off\n\nTrue sneakerheads are always digging for the next unexpected trend. A current, curious one: off-road hybrids.\n\nTHOUGH TECHY running brands like France\u2019s Salomon, Japan\u2019s Asics and Richmond, Calif.-based Hoka One One once catered to serious (mostly off-road) runners, they\u2019ve lately found themselves in fashion. This year, Salomon collaborated with the Broken Arm, a Paris boutique, on a few shoes; Hoka One One has created sneakers with New York\u2019s Engineered Garments and millennial-favorite workout brand Outdoor Voices; and Asics have appeared on the runway at Bulgarian designer Kiko Kostadinov\u2019s fashion shows.\n\nHow did advanced running sneakers become stylish? According to Nordstrom\u2019s Sam Lobban, vice president of men\u2019s fashion, they embody multiple current sneaker trends including chunky soles, bold colors and the profile of throwback \u201cdad\u201d running shoes. Add in the popularity of working out, or at least dressing as if you\u2019re liable to, among a younger generation and it\u2019s clear why tech running shoes are racing to the top of the trend pyramid. They immediately signal \u201cI\u2019m outdoorsy\u201c for poseurs, and for actual runners they do double duty. As Mr. Lobban pointed out, \u201cIf you\u2019re a guy that\u2019s into fashion and you also run a lot, all of a sudden you\u2019ve got a shoe that can do both.\u201d\n\nCATCHING THE WAVE The interior of Atmos in Tokyo is aptly architectural.\n\nStores Worth the Flight\n\nIn a shopping landscape increasingly driven by ecommerce, here are five worthy destination stores.\n\n1. Slam Jam / Milan Seek out curiosities like Roa\u2019s burly-soled trail shoes and Camperlab\u2019s tire-tread sole sneakers at this 30-year-old Italian sneaker institution.\n\n2.

VULCVANIZED RUBBER (1839) Inventor Charles Goodyear discovered vulcanization: a way of fortifying rubber against abrasion. The applications included tires and rubber-soled sneakers.\n\n2. NIKE AIR (1978) With the help of aerospace engineer Frank Rudy, Nike rolled out the Tailwind, its first model with a cushy \u201cair bag\u201d tucked in the sole.\n\n3. GEL CUSHIONING (1987) Asics\u2019s Tiger Gel-Lyte running shoes swapped hefty foam linings for swapped hefty foam linings for a silicon-based gel. At just 9.9 ounces it opened the door for featherweight footwear to come.\n\n4. KNIT UPPERS (2012) Sneaker tops crafted from special yarns, like Nike\u2019s Flyknit, or natural and synthetic fibers, as in Adidas\u2019s Primeknit, lightened shoes further and helped eliminate waste.\n\n5. 3-D PRINTING (2013) Nike\u2019s Vapor Laser Talon football cleat was the first fully 3D-printed cleat of its kind. Today brands from New Balance to Adidas to Under Armour are printing soles, uppers and entire shoes.\n\nThe Elements of Sneakers Your pair is out there. Nike Air Max 270 React, $150, nike.com.
