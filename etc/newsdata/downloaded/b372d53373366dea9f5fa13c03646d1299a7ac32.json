ADVERTISEMENT\n\nOfficials at ACT said the new options aim to increase student opportunities for college admission and scholarships.\n\nIt's unclear how much students will have to pay to retake a portion of the exam when ACT rolls out the option. The current cost is $52 without the optional writing section and $68 with it.\n\nACT officials told The New York Times that taking an individual section would be cheaper than retaking the exam in entirety, but said they had not yet decided on a price.\n\nAlong with allowing students to opt to take individual sections, ACT will start allowing students to combine section scores from different tests to create an ACT \u201csuperscore.\u201d\n\nACT claims its own research suggests \"superscoring\" is \"actually more predictive of how students will perform in their college courses than other scoring methods.\"\n\nThe exam will also begin offering online testing to provide faster score results. The online testing will be available as an option at selected centers initially with a goal of expanding to all.\n\nResults from online tests would be available in two days compared to around two weeks, according to ACT.\n\nStudents will have the option to choose online or paper testing.", "description": "The ACT exam will start letting students retake\u00a0individual sections of the test as part of three changes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/students_4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
