Educators have a unique responsibility towards the moral empowerment of their students. This concept has traditionally been captured predominantly through \u2018moral education\u2019 classes in which ideas of morality and standards of conduct are discussed in abstract. There is recognition that this approach is insufficient for effecting meaningful moral development of children, and that \u201cmoral education\u201d must be infused in the very teaching methodology of all educators.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy speaking to our students in a way that recognises their true character \u2013 rather than simply their academic achievement or \u2018marks\u2019 \u2013 all educators can be catalysts for the moral development of children. An exemplar methodology can be found in the \u201clanguage of virtues\u201d espoused by educators and organisations such as The Virtues Project.\n\n\n\nIt is often unrealistic to expect even the most innovative educators to perform new classroom practices or change their subject pedagogy when they already face immense pressure to complete their regular syllabus. The beauty of the language of virtues is that it can have a positive impact without time-consuming practice changes: simply through the language that we use, it is possible to establish a connection of love and trust that will support students in their moral development.As one sees students demonstrating their virtues such as patience, friendliness, or justice, they can be acknowledged for exhibiting these noble qualities. Likewise, as they are observed struggling to call on their virtues, they can be supported to recognise the virtues that they need to be called to. For example, instead of telling a child to \u201cbe quiet and listen to your classmate\u201d, we can invite them to \u201cbe respectful when listening to what each person says\u201d. Students can also be guided to understand that they have the opportunity to uplift one another in every interaction they have amongst themselves, whether it be practising generosity and kindness in sharing stationery with a fellow student who has forgotten theirs, or helpfulness and humility in assisting a friend who is struggling with their exam preparation. Students can be encouraged to demonstrate moral leadership amongst their peers by striving to distinguish themselves by how virtuously they treat one another. Over time, a school environment of encouragement can be created that is based not only on academic success, but also the virtues latent in all of us.Learning to use the language of virtues is possible for any educator who sees value in doing so. The shift toward the language of virtues would advance moral education through a gradual cultural shift in schools, in which teachers and students alike are able to recognise each other for the virtues that all human beings possess.This methodology has found success in over 100 countries, and The Virtues Project has been honoured by the United Nations and endorsed by the Dalai Lama. We hope that the language of virtues will take hold across the country and support the development of our safe, loving, and high-performance national learning community.
