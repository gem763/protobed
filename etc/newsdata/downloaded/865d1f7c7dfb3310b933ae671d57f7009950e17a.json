Some of the children told the police that their relatives had taken them there believing the building to be a Koranic school.\n\nBut the police say there is no concrete evidence to suggest that the building was ever a school.\n\nEight suspects have been arrested.\n\nThe police chief said the detainees - some with injuries and starved of food - were overjoyed to be freed.\n\nThey were taken to a stadium in Kaduna overnight to be cared for while arrangements are made to find their families.\n\nNigerian authorities say the nearly 500 freed captives will be given medical and psychological examinations.", "description": "Nearly 500 men and boys were tortured, sexually abused, chained up and starved, police say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10657/production/_108995176_whatsappimage2019-09-27at09.37.05.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
