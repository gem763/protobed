Turkey launched its operation into Syria days after Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke by phone and the White House announced that the United States would not stand in Turkey\u2019s way.\n\n[U.S. forces say Turkey was deliberately \u2018bracketing\u2019 American troops with artillery fire in Syria]\n\nTrump saved his remarks about Syria until the end of his 80-minute speech to the Values Voter Summit in Washington, where he delivered a stripped-down version of his campaign-rally speech with its familiar targets and complaints.\n\nTrump railed against the \u201cradical left,\u201d repeated his claim that he thinks House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) \u201chates this country\u201d and called Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) \u201ccrooked as hell.\u201d\n\nHe mocked Schiff\u2019s appearance, calling him \u201cpencil neck,\u201d and told a woman in the audience that she \u201cwould not be impressed with him physically.\u201d\n\nHe also criticized Somali-born refugee Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) as \u201canti-Semitic\u201d and described the Democrats as \u201cwaging war on everyone in this room.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cradical left\u201d wants to \u201cindoctrinate our children,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey resent and disdain faithful Americans. Given the chance, they\u2019d use every instrument of government power to try and shut you down.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Stunning in ugliness & tone\u2019: Trump denounced for attacking Somali refugees in Minnesota]\n\nTrump\u2019s support among white evangelicals has been unflagging since he won 80 percent of their vote in 2016. But his recent military decision has exposed some fractures in that reliable base. Pat Robertson, a longtime Trump supporter and founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, said Monday that Trump \u201cis in danger of losing the mandate of heaven\u201d for betraying the Kurds.\n\nBefore Trump spoke, Cissie Graham Lynch, the granddaughter of the late Rev. Billy Graham, offered prayers for the Kurdish people. Then she prayed for Trump and Vice President Pence.\n\nWhen Trump took the stage, Andrew Brunson, a pastor who had been a prisoner in Turkey for two years and was accused of committing crimes on behalf of Kurdish fighters, prayed over him.\n\n\u201cI ask that you give the president supernatural discernment to know who is trustworthy and who is not. Bring into the light all deception and intrigue. Expose and reverse the plans of those who would harm President Trump and this nation,\u201d Brunson said, his hand on Trump\u2019s shoulder.\n\nYet some of the harshest criticism of Trump over his troop withdrawal has come from members of his Republican Party, including his closest congressional allies.\n\nIn a tweet, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.) seized on the president\u2019s complaint about the United States being stuck in an \u201cendless war.\u201d\n\n\u201cSituation when we were there: relative peace. We leave: -Turkey attacks our Kurdish allies -shoots artillery at US troops -bombs a prison where ISIS fighters already escaped. -ISIS car bomb in Qamishli. That\u2019s just day one. Which scenario looks more like an endless war?\u201d Crenshaw said.\n\nTrump sought to reassure the crowd that Turkey would face \u201cswift, strong and severe economic sanctions\u201d if it does \u201cnot meet their commitments, including the protection of religious minorities.\u201d He also announced $50 million in emergency financial assistance to Syrian groups that support ethnic and religious victims of this conflict.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Trump spent considerable time lashing out at the House impeachment inquiry, arguing that it is for \u201chorrible, horrible crimes\u201d and labeling it a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nHe also rehashed the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, telling the crowd that the accounts of sexual assault were \u201cphony stories about him. They were made up. Just like they are made up about me and other people.\u201d\n\nChristine Blasey Ford alleged that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers. Kavanaugh has denied the accusation.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Trump acknowledged widespread opposition to the move, describing himself as being on an \u201cisland of one.\u201d", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "October At Pm", "Colitkowitz Currently Covers Politics", "Congress For The Washington Post.
