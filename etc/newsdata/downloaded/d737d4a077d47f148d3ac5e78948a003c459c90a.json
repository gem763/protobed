Photo: Damian Dovarganes/AP\n\nFor years, prominent Democratic donor Ed Buck has been a deeply suspicious figure. Between July 2017 and January 2019, two black gay men were found dead in Buck\u2019s West Hollywood apartment from methamphetamine overdoses; police ruled both accidental. But Los Angeles activists insisted otherwise, arguing that Buck was a predator with a penchant for preying on young black gay men, and administering them drugs \u2014 and that he was able to escape scrutiny because of his influence and his close ties to elected officials.\n\nAfter dodging charges for more than two years, Buck is finally facing criminal repercussions: On September 17, he was arrested after a third man overdosed at his apartment. According to authorities, the man, who survived, had received two \u201cdangerously large\u201d injections of crystal meth; that same day, Buck was charged with three counts of battery causing serious injury, administering methamphetamine, and maintaining a drug house. Then, on September 19, federal prosecutors charged Buck with an additional count of distribution of methamphetamine resulting in death \u2014 a serious federal drug offense.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about Ed Buck, from his political ties in West Hollywood to the deaths that occurred at his alleged \u201cdrug house.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a wealthy Democratic donor.\n\nBuck is a 65-year-old retired entrepreneur whom the New York Times calls \u201ca recognizable figure in West Hollywood \u2026 who became a fixture in Los Angeles Democratic political circles.\u201d Over the years, he has reportedly donated tens of thousands of dollars to various California races and liberal causes.\n\nHe\u2019s accused of preying on gay black men, and administering them drugs against their will.\n\nIn court on September 19, U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna argued that Buck has a \u201cdisturbing\u201d pattern of soliciting vulnerable men for sex in exchange for drugs and money, and that he injects them with drugs against their will.\n\nSince 2017, three overdoses at Buck\u2019s house have made headlines. In July of that year, 26-year-old Gemmel Moore, a black man who worked as an escort, was found dead in Buck\u2019s apartment from a methamphetamine overdose, which a coroner\u2019s report deemed accidental. Buck\u2019s lawyer Seymour Amster argued that his client had nothing to do with the incident. However, evidence suggested otherwise: At the time of Moore\u2019s death, Buck\u2019s apartment was reportedly covered in drug paraphernalia; additionally, the Los Angeles Times obtained a journal found in Moore\u2019s possessions, in which the victim wrote that Buck \u201cgave me my first injection of crystal meth.\u201d (While Buck came under investigation over this death, he was never charged.)\n\nThe second suspicious incident occurred in January 2019, when a second gay black man \u2014 Timothy Dean \u2014 was found dead of an overdose in Buck\u2019s apartment. Amster, yet again, maintained his client\u2019s innocence, claiming that Dean had \u201cingested some type of substance\u201d before arriving at the apartment. Dean\u2019s roommate, however, pushed back on Amster\u2019s characterization of Dean. \u201cI\u2019ve personally never seen him using drugs and never seen him in the apparent state of alteration caused by any form of drug,\u201d Ottavio Taddei told the New York Times.\n\nAgain, Buck was not hit with charges. A little over a month after Dean\u2019s death, though, Moore\u2019s mother, Latisha Nixon, filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Buck, claiming that Buck \u201chad a predatory and injurious system of soliciting Black men and watching them cling to life.\u201d\n\nMost recently, on September 11, a third unidentified man overdosed at Buck\u2019s West Hollywood apartment. Prosecutors allege that Buck tried to stop the man from fleeing his house, but was ultimately unsuccessful; they also say that inside Buck\u2019s house, police discovered hundreds of photographs of men in \u201ccompromising positions,\u201d per the Los Angeles Times.\n\nOn September 19, Amster maintained that he and Buck will \u201cfight this case vigorously.\u201d\n\nBuck may have had more alleged victims that previously believed.\n\nProsecutors believe that Buck had more than three victims. \u201cInvestigators have identified 10 additional victims,\u201d U.S. Attorney Hanna said, \u201cnine of whom [Buck] administered drugs or strongly encouraged them to ingest narcotics as part of agreements to be compensated for sexual services.\u201d According to the federal complaint against Buck, which was obtained by the Los Angeles Times, one escort told investigators that Buck gave him a \u201cclear soda\u201d that caused him to lose consciousness. When the man awoke he said that \u201cBuck was approaching him with two additional syringes loaded with methamphetamine.\u201d Other men in the complaint shared similar stories: that Buck hired them as escorts, and then provided them substances that made them weak and tired.\n\nPer the document, homeless men who lived nearby Buck\u2019s apartment also had a sinister nickname for him: \u201cDr. Kevorkian,\u201d referring to the U.S. physician and assisted-suicide advocate who helped more than 100 terminally ill people end their lives.\n\nBuck is facing both state and federal charges.\n\nOn September 17, after the third man who overdosed at Buck\u2019s house told authorities that Buck had administered him \u201ctwo dangerously large doses of methamphetamine,\u201d Buck was arrested and charged with three counts of battery causing serious injury, administering methamphetamine, and maintaining a drug house. Then, on September 19, federal prosecutors charged him with one count of distribution of methamphetamine resulting in death.\n\nIn a press conference on Thursday, Los Angeles district attorney Jackie Lacey said, \u201cThe surviving victim\u2019s statements gave us the break we needed.\u201d\n\nActivists and the victims\u2019 families are celebrating the charges, but are frustrated it took this long.\n\nOn Thursday, Jasmyne Cannick, the spokesperson for the families of the men who have overdosed, told the New York Times that Buck\u2019s federal drug charge was \u201ca victory for our community.\u201d She continued, \u201cIt just goes to show that persistence and perseverance pay off.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s mother, Latisha Nixon, also spoke out about the federal charges in a video she uploaded to YouTube, saying she was \u201cso grateful,\u201d and that she \u201cknew this day was gonna come.\u201d However, she, along with her attorneys and Cannick, expressed frustration with District Attorney Lacey, who they say previously failed them in \u201cher poorly conducted investigation and prosecution of Ed Buck.\u201d\n\n\u201cLacey falsely claimed that her team worked diligently and carefully to find and speak with witnesses over the course of the last two years. This is untrue,\u201d Nixon\u2019s lawyers, Nana Gyamfi and Hussain Turk, wrote in a statement. They are also urging Lacey to \u201cexpand the State\u2019s criminal complaint against Ed Buck by adding two counts of 1st-degree felony murder.\u201d\n\nIf convicted on all charges, Buck could serve life in prison.\n\nIf Buck is convicted solely on all the state-level charges, he could serve a maximum sentence of five years and eight months. The new federal charge is much more serious \u2014 it carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years, and a maximum sentence of life. His next court hearing is scheduled for September 26.\n\nStay in touch.
