It provides \u201cinstant sophistication,\u201d she says. \u201cLighting is the great special effect that changes everything in a room.\u201d And it\u2019s easy to install yourself. Even a first-timer can expect to install a dimmer switch in fewer than 30 minutes \u2014 with no trips to the emergency room. Here\u2019s our guide to the tools you\u2019ll need, what you need to know, dimmer options, and how to install your new switch.\n\nGet Your Tools\n\nChannellock 7-Piece Magnetic Screwdriver Set You need a flat-head screwdriver for the screws that secure the decorative plate to the wall, and a Phillips-head screwdriver for the screws that hold the switch to the electrical box. This solid seven-piece set includes multiple sizes of both types of screwdrivers. They\u2019re magnetic, which you\u2019ll appreciate when you see the tiny size of the screws in the plastic wall plate, and made in the USA. $24 at Amazon Buy $24 at Amazon Buy\n\nChannellock 6-in-1 Screwdriver If you want to spend a little less money and save some space in your tool drawer, get a screwdriver base with interchangeable tips. It\u2019s not as strong as a one-piece screwdriver, but you won\u2019t need to worry about that until you start building deck furniture. $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nDo Some Recon\n\nBefore you start shopping for a dimmer switch, do a little recon. Head to the room with the light you want to dim. If only one switch controls the light, you need a standard single-pole dimmer. If two switches control the same light (say one at the top of the stairs and one at the bottom), that calls for a three-way unit. Next, take a look at the type of light bulb the switch will control. Incandescent and halogen lighting work with most dimmers, but if you\u2019ve updated to more environmentally friendly CFL or LED bulbs, they can flash or buzz \u2014 and generally drive you crazy \u2014 if you buy the wrong switch. (Especially if they\u2019re not specifically labeled as dimmable bulbs.) The dimmer\u2019s packaging will confirm that it works for the bulbs you have.\n\nPick Your Switch\n\nSchmidt likes this single-pole push-button switch with mother-of-pearl detail for vintage-style homes, and recommends pairing it with a traditional-looking brass cover. It works with most types of bulbs.\n\nLutron Maestro Dimmer Switch This more modern-looking option can handle single- or three-pole setup and comes in 25 different colors, in case you want to match your paint or wallpaper. $23 at Amazon Buy $23 at Amazon Buy\n\nLumary WiFi Smart Dimmer Switch If you are the kind of person who wants to dim your lights with your voice, this universal switch works with Amazon Alexa and Google Home (or your finger). You can get the price down to $21 if you buy a two-pack and use the 10 percent off instant coupon. $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nLegrand Adorne Touch Tru-Universal Dimmer These sleek touch plates are activated with simple taps. They work with most bulbs and setups. $95 at Amazon Buy $95 at Amazon Buy\n\nHow to Install Your New Dimmer\n\nWhen you have your switch and are ready to work, the first step is cutting power to the light. Go to your circuit panel and flip the breaker that corresponds to the room you\u2019re working in. Test the light switch to make sure the light no longer goes on, then double-check the outlet with a voltage tester.\n\nYou\u2019re ready to install your switch. Here\u2019s how:\n\nThe screw holes that hold the switches in place are oblong, allowing you to make minor adjustments to line them up properly.\n\nStep 1: Most light switches are covered with plastic decorative plates. Use a flat-head screwdriver to remove the screws holding it in place. When you lift the plate off you\u2019ll see two screws holding the switch itself against the electrical box. Remove them with a Phillips-head screwdriver.\n\nStep 2: The wires that attach to the switch are thick and don\u2019t move easily. Gently stretch them by pulling the switch away from the wall, giving yourself a little room to work. In most cases, the wires are connected to the switch in one of two ways: They might be held down by screws on the sides of the switch, or twisted to the ends of wires coming out of the switch and secured with wire caps (little plastic cones that hold and protect the wires).\n\nFor this type of switch, loosen the screws on the side of the switch then pull the wires out.\n\nStep 3: Here\u2019s where it matters what kind of switch you have. If it\u2019s a single-pole switch, there will be three wires coming out of the wall (typically red, black, and green). You can separate the wires from the old switch \u2014 either by loosening the screws on the old switch or by unscrewing the wire caps \u2014 and skip to the next step.\n\nIf you have a three-way switch, there will be four wires (typically red, black, green, and striped, but don\u2019t worry if yours are different). Locate the wire that is connected to the black screw on the old switch. That\u2019s the hot wire, which carries electricity to the switch. Mark it with a piece of tape, then disconnect the wires.\n\nStep 4: It\u2019s time to connect the wires from the new switch to the wires in the wall.\n\nSINGLE-POLE SWITCH: This video shows the process. (You can ignore the part about cutting off the ends of the wires. If you need to straighten them, just do it with a pair of pliers.) Connect the green wire from the switch to the green wire in the wall. Your dimmer will probably use a wire cap to do this. (If there is less than a half-inch of bare wire showing, expose more using a wire stripper.) Line up the exposed parts of both wires, put the cap over them, then twist until the cap is tight. Gently pull on each wire to make sure they don\u2019t come out, then wrap them with a couple loops of electrical tape. Connect the other two wires. It doesn\u2019t matter which connects to which.\n\nTHREE-WAY SWITCH: This part of the video focuses on the three-way switch. Connect the green wires first. Then connect the two red wires from the new switch with the two wires you did not mark with tape. (It doesn\u2019t matter which connects to which.) Finally, connect the black wire from the switch with the wire you marked with tape.\n\nStep 5: Ease all the wires back into the hole and then slide the switch in after them. This can get annoying, since the wires are thick and there\u2019s not a lot of room in the box; so if you need to, gently push the wires in with your screwdriver.\n\nStep 6: Screw the switch back into the electrical box.\n\nStep 7: Put the plate back in place and put the screws back in. If the switch does not align with the plate, just take the plate off, loosen the screws on the switch, then slide the switch a bit to either side, tighten the screws, and try again.\n\nStep 8: Turn the power back on.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
