Laskaridis Charitable Foundation, a private environmental group.\n\nLast year, the foundation worked with the Greek island of Sikinos in the Aegean sea to ban plastic straws, which are widely used in the summer for drinking iced coffee.\n\nAccording to the group, Greece imports about 700,000 tonnes of raw plastic materials each year and discards 40,000 tonnes of plastic, of which 70 per cent ends up on the coast.\n\nDuring the summer, the rate goes up to 76 per cent of which only eight per cent is recycled.\n\nGreece lags behind its EU neighbours in recycling rubbish, especially plastics. The country was late to adopt a plastic bag fee in shops in January 2018.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Consumer - [ATHENS] Greece announced a campaign on Wednesday to tackle plastic pollution and promised to stop the use of single-use plastics by June 2020. .
