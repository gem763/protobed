The European Central Bank has urged governments to focus on fiscal policy because the room for more monetary easing is limited.\n\nThe single currency, trading around $1.10 before the numbers were released, dropped 0.5% to as low as $1.0966 EUR=EBS , its weakest since Sept. 12.\n\nThe euro also slid versus the Swiss franc, losing 0.5% to as low as 1.0857 francs EURCHF=EBS .\n\n\"The ECB is being ignored for now and hence prospects of any near-term shift in policy do not look particularly realistic,\" MUFG analysts said. \"We see little upside scope for here.\"\n\nThe dollar was boosted by the euro's decline, and its index - which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies - was last up 0.2% at 98.748 .\n\nThe dollar has held up well in recent months as investors are attracted to its relatively high yield and the strength of the U.S. economy.\n\nElsewhere, foreign exchange markets reflected fading optimism over a U.S.-China trade deal.\n\nBoth China and the United States published positive statements after the latest talks, with the U.S. Trade Representative's office describing the talks as \"productive\" and China's Commerce Ministry calling them \"constructive\". October's high-level talks remain on track. the safe-haven Japanese yen reversed its earlier losses and was last up 0.1% at 107.41 as any optimism was overshadowed by worries about the health of the global economy.\n\nChina's offshore yuan dropped 0.1% to 7.1237 yuan CNH=EBS .\n\nSterling slipped 0.2% to $1.2442 GBP=D3 as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson cautioned that there would be no Brexit breakthrough at talks with European leaders in New York.
