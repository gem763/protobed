She had not told anyone she was pregnant and she buried the infant in her backyard in Carlisle, Ohio, afterwards.\n\nIt was only when she went to the gynecologist two months later that she confessed to what she had done.\n\nThe baby's father was Trey Johnson, a teenager who she had a fling with in the summer of 2016.\n\nHe found out he was the father on Facebook about Skylar's arrest and for two years, watched from the sidelines as the case played out in court.\n\nBoth he and his mother testified at court about how he had nothing to do with the pregnancy.\n\nOn Sunday night, Johnson and his mother Tracy gathered for a candlelit vigil with other members of the community to big farewell to Annabelle.\n\nTrey Johnson, pictured with his mother Tracy, at the vigil he held for his late daughter, Annabelle, on Sunday. He has never spoken publicly about the case but testified at Skylar Richardson's trial\n\nSkylar is shown in a recent CBS documentary about the case. She was acquitted of murder last month and was convicted of gross abuse of a corpse\n\nIt is unclear if they attended a private funeral that the Richardson family held for the baby after Skylar's acquittal.\n\nThey were given the baby's remains following the acquittal and a judge ordered them to give the Johnson family access to Annabelle's grave site.\n\nAt the vigil on Sunday night, Tracy Johnson - who wept at the trial - said she was grateful for the support she had received.\n\nShe also used the vigil to lament being kept out of the loop by the Richardson family.\n\n'We have found out everything though Facebook.\n\n'We found out about the paternity on Facebook, although it was a rumor at the time,' Traci said.\n\nTrey's mother Tracy is pictured at the vigil on Sunday night reading a statement to thank friends and family for their support\n\nProsecutors showed the jury this photograph of the infant's skeletal remains after they were dug up from the family's yard\n\nSkylar was acquitted on Thursday September 12 only three hours after the jury began deliberating\n\nKim and Scott Richardson said they suffered through 'purgatory' for two years\n\nTrey's mother Tracy said she would have raised the baby as her own but that Skylar never gave her the chance\n\nAt the trial, she said she would have raised the baby herself if she had been given the option.\n\nTrey did not speak but he attended the vigil.\n\nHe stood next to his mother and held up a candle for his daughter.\n\nAt the trial, Johnson told how Skylar cut off all communication with him in the summer of 2016 after they had sex.\n\nHe said he had no idea she was pregnant.\n\nShe was dating someone else when she gave birth to the baby, and that boy insisted he did not know she was pregnant either.\n\nHer own parents, Kim and Scott, also said they had no knowledge of the pregnancy.\n\nThey merely thought their daughter, who had a long history of eating disorders, was gaining weight.\n\nProsecutors accused Skylar of killing the baby and then burying her because she thought being a mother would interfere with her lifestyle.\n\nShe was acquitted of murder and manslaughter but was convicted of gross abuse of a corpse.\n\nNow, she is working for her attorneys' law firm and hopes to attend college later in the year.", "description": "Trey Johnson was the baby's father.
