A newly formed Office of Racial Equity and Social Justice would identify existing government policies that could be changed to address inequities.\n\nSuch sweeping, government-wide initiatives have been controversial in other cities and counties, with critics questioning their expense and effectiveness.\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday, County Council President Nancy Navarro (D-District 4) said the bill\u2019s detailed provisions would ensure the \u201cdiscipline\u201d necessary to address the racial disparities in Montgomery, where there is a higher poverty rate for black and Latino residents than for whites and a disproportionate number of black youths arrested.\n\n\u201cAlthough all of us want to work toward this goal, the reality is that unless we have structural pieces in place that force us, we will never be able to get to that ultimate goal,\u201d Navarro said, flanked by a dozen advocates and activists.\n\nShe said she does not think the additional requirements would slow down the legislative process, because council members are already discussing racial equity in meetings; the new bill would simply codify it.\n\nJayne Park, executive director of the organization Impact Silver Spring, said the bill seems comprehensive, though details on implementation remain unclear. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what an \u2018impact statement\u2019 looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cHow is it actually going to happen?\u201d\n\nMarie Taylor, president of Leadership Montgomery, a Rockville-based nonprofit group that provides racial-equity training, said she was \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d by the level of detail in the proposed bill. The real test of commitment for the county\u2019s lawmakers, she noted, will be what resources they set aside to implement its provisions.\n\nSkeptics of racial-equity initiatives said they will be paying close attention as well.\n\n\u201cIt would be a hard sell to me if they need to raise taxes to pay for this,\u201d said Dan McHugh, a former president of the Montgomery County Young Republicans and critic of the county\u2019s immigration-related policies. \u201cMy big question is how much is it going to cost, and how are we going to pay for it?\u201d\n\nA fiscal impact and economic impact statement for the initiative is still in the works. Officials say they have yet to decide what the size of the racial equity office would be.\n\nIn Northern Virginia\u2019s Fairfax County, the equity office includes one director, two policy advisers and an annual budget of more than $480,000. In Washington state\u2019s King County, widely recognized as the leading jurisdiction for racial-equity initiatives, there is an office that operates with nine full-time staff members and a biennial budget of $4 million.\n\nA public hearing for the Montgomery bill is scheduled for Oct. 22. Several advocacy groups organized under the Montgomery County Racial Equity (MORE) Network are hosting a \u201cpeople\u2019s forum\u201d on the bill on Thursday.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal governments are trying to fix racial inequity.
