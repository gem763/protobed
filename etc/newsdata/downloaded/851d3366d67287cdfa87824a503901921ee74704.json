In 1968, Roy came to Washington to serve as a trombonist in the U.S. Marine Band, \u201cThe President\u2019s Own.\u201d He\u2019d entered an organ music contest and though his composition didn\u2019t win, it caught the ear of Resurrection\u2019s then-organist, who was going on maternity leave. Roy filled in and then was offered the job after she decided to step down.\n\nThe church, on Washington Boulevard, had something going for it: a Reuter pipe organ, barely a year old.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the things that drew me to the job,\u201d Roy said. Up in the loft \u2014 flanked by the choir, his hands on the keys, his feet on the pedals \u2014 Roy could make a big sound.\n\nThe church has been celebrating Roy\u2019s golden anniversary all month, but Sunday was the main attraction, with much of the music in the service drawn from a book of Roy\u2019s that was just published: \u201c10 Hymn Accompaniments for Trumpet and Organ.\u201d\n\nOn the trumpet was Chuck Seipp, formerly of the U.S. Army Band, \u201cPershing\u2019s Own.\u201d The chest-tickling rumble of Roy\u2019s pipe organ filled the sanctuary, followed by the bright, clear tone of Chuck\u2019s trumpet piercing the air in counterpoint.\n\nWhat makes Roy a good church music director?\n\n\u201cHe understands the liturgy,\u201d said Resurrection\u2019s interim minister, the Rev. Michael Guy. \u201cHe understands the theology. Everything has a universal flow. . . . Music is part of the worship experience. You may not completely understand the sermon, but you understand the hymns.\u201d\n\nLater, Roy tells me: \u201cThis goes clear back to Martin Luther himself and Johann Sebastian Bach. They made a big deal out of music. With Bach it was cantatas. With Luther it was hymns.\u201d\n\nRoy is steeped in music. He chaired the music department at George Washington University for 20 years and was an associate dean there before retiring in 2013. He met his wife, Eileen, over an organ keyboard. She\u2019s a musician, too, professor of church music at Wesley Theological Seminary in the District. For 31 years, she was the music minister at Foundry United Methodist on 16th Street NW. Roy and Eileen used to perform together: she on organ, he on trombone. The couple live in Vienna, Va.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that their daughter, Christina, 28, is in the family business. She teaches music at a middle school in Wilmington, N.C., where she directs six choirs.\n\nResurrection congregant John Handley is on the church\u2019s call committee, charged with finding a new pastor. \u201cWe\u2019ve been interviewing applicants,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tell them that Roy has been the music director for 50 years \u2014 but that that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nRoy has kept it fresh, working with the choir, picking the hymns, creating his own arrangements, matching the music with the message. Roy knows the instrument, and he knows the space his music must fill.\n\nAbout 20 years ago the congregation decided it was time to get cushions for the wooden pews. Roy wondered how that would affect the sanctuary\u2019s acoustics, which weren\u2019t so great to begin with: dry and dead.\n\nRoy worked with an acoustical engineer to determine how to alter the space so the sound would be better. Panels were installed on the ceiling \u2014 and the pew cushions were approved.\n\n\u201cNow instead of having about two-tenths of a second of reverberation time, we have 1.4 seconds of reverberation time,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThat seems to be ideal.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday after the service \u2014 and after the coffee-and-danish crowd had thinned in the church basement \u2014 Roy took me up to the choir loft.\n\nA stuffed Kansas Jayhawk mascot sat atop the organ console. (He and his wife both went to the University of Kansas.) Affixed on a panel next to the organ\u2019s drawknobs were colorful Post-it notes left by his daughter: \u201cLove you, Daddy!\u201d and \u201cHave fun. Love you!!\u201d\n\n\u201cChristina put those there years ago,\u201d Roy said. \u201cShe probably doesn\u2019t know they\u2019re still there. It\u2019s kind of fun to look down and see her presence.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, I imagined someone high above looking down at Roy.\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "At Resurrection Lutheran, congregants offer a prayer of thanks for Roy Guenther.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/95RRctSZhJcBdjC_UjUU8NVE_d4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O2ER3WG64AI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
