Afghan Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERS\n\nThe deal, reached after months of negotiations with representatives from the insurgent movement, must still be approved by U.S. President Donald Trump before it can be signed, Khalilzad said in an interview with Tolo News television.\n\n\u201cIn principle, we have got there,\u201d he said.\n\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani has been briefed on a draft of the accord and will look at details of the deal before giving an opinion, his spokesman said on Monday.\n\nIn exchange for the phased withdrawal, the Taliban would commit not to allow Afghanistan to be used by militants to plot attacks on the United States and its allies.\n\nIt includes provision for so-called \u201cintra-Afghan\u201d talks to reach a broader political settlement and end the fighting between the Taliban and the Western-backed government in Kabul.\n\nHowever details of any future negotiations remain unclear, with the Taliban so far refusing to deal directly with the government, which it considers an illegitimate \u201cpuppet\u201d regime.\n\nGhani met Khalilzad and will \u201cstudy and assess\u201d details of the draft, spokesman Sediq Sediqqi told reporters earlier on Monday.\n\n\u201cBut for us, a meaningful peace or a path to a meaningful peace is the end of violence and direct negotiation with the Taliban,\u201d he said.\n\nMany Afghan government officials have resented the exclusion of the government from the U.S.-Taliban talks. There was some uncertainty about whether Ghani had been given a copy of the agreement, or simply shown it.\n\nKhalilzad, who has completed nine rounds of talks with Taliban representatives, is scheduled to hold meetings with a number of Afghan leaders in Kabul this week to build a consensus before the deal is signed.\n\nThe peace talks have taken place against a backdrop of relentless violence, with the Taliban mounting two large-scale attacks on the major northern cities of Kunduz and Pul-e Khumri over the weekend.\n\nAfghan security forces pushed back Taliban fighters from both cities but a suicide bomber detonated his explosives on Monday in Kunduz, killing at least six policemen and wounding 15, officials and the Taliban said.\n\nTrump has made little secret of his desire to bring the roughly 14,000 troops home from Afghanistan, where American troops have been deployed since a U.S.-led campaign overthrew the Taliban in 2001.\n\nBut there are concerns among Afghan officials and U.S. national security aides about a U.S. withdrawal, with fears Afghanistan could be plunged into a new civil war that could herald a return of Taliban rule and allow international militants, including Islamic State, to find a refuge.", "description": "The United States would withdraw almost 5,000 troops from Afghanistan and close five bases within 135 days under a draft peace accord agreed with the Taliban, the chief U.S. negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad said on Monday.", "authors": ["Hamid Shalizi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425430314&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF81183"}
