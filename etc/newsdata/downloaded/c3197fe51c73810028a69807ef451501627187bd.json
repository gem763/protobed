Chris Murphy: Ukraine whistleblower 'has to come forward'", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said the whistleblower who raised concerns about President Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukraine\u2019s new president should \u201ccome forward\u201d so that Congress can decide if punishment is in order.\n\nMr. Murphy also said the White House\u2019s decision to release held-up aid to Ukraine as the whistleblower issue surfaced is \u201cincredibly suspicious.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump says he didn\u2019t do anything wrong during a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, though he appeared to suggest Sunday he did bring up his Democratic foe, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, and possible \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine involving Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter.\n\nMr. Murphy is among Democrats who say the White House needs to let the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, share the whistleblower\u2019s concerns with Congress.\n\n\u201cI think that if we do have the evidence from this whistleblower that the president indeed did try to bully a foreign power into affecting our elections then we have to do something about it,\u201d Mr. Murphy told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.\n\nMr. Trump released $250 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine on Sept. 12, as Capitol Hill asked questions and as the whistleblower standoff began to surface.\n\n\u201cThe timing is obviously incredibly suspicious,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cThere was also a pending vote in the appropriations committee that was going to require next year\u2019s aid to be released outside of the discretion of the president. There are likely a bunch of different explanations \u2014 political pressure was mounting on the president from Republicans \u2014 but obviously the timing of this looks really terrible.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are worried that Mr. Trump held up $250 million in aid as part of a bid to dig up dirt on Mr. Biden through his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe aid was eventually released Sept. 12, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky complained about the holdup during Mr. Murphy\u2019s visit to Kiev.\n\n\u201cThe government and Zelensky was personally was really worried about these overtures he was getting from particularly from Rudy Giuliani, and he didn\u2019t understand whether this was an official government position, these requests to investigate the former vice president,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cSo, I went here to make it clear to him, that the worst thing that he could do for the U.S.-Ukraine relationship is to get involved in an election here in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe asked us what was going on with the aid, why was it being withheld,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cHe seemed very concerned and out of sorts about it.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump on Sunday suggested the delay was related to his push to get other countries pony up a fair share for Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI backed Ukraine from the beginning, but I\u2019m very upset that other countries aren\u2019t doing the same,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cGermany should be spending much more, France, all of the European Union should be spending money. Why are we spending money and they\u2019re not? Or at least they\u2019re spending very little by comparison, so I\u2019m not happy about that.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
