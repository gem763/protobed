But he said he worries that \"sometimes it feels like the administration doesn't ever get it.\"\n\nHe said agencies must \"speak truth to power and not allow their services to be co-opted. We as a committee have to have their backs.\"\n\nAttorney General William Barr in Washington, DC, October 3, 2019. Reuters\n\nWarner was responding to reports that Barr and US Attorney John Durham of Connecticut had approached British, Australian and Italian authorities with questions about the bona fides of sources such as Josef Mifsud, a Maltese academic whose gossip about alleged Russian possession of Hillary Clinton emails helped to trigger the initial FBI investigation.\n\nJustice Department officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. Barr has told CBS News that official explanations for the FBI's investigation \"don't hang together.\"\n\nSome former law-enforcement officials have raised concerns Barr is using the Justice Department to chase unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that could benefit Trump politically. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation concluded Moscow interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump.\n\nFollowing a visit to Britain in July for a summit of Five Eyes officials, Barr held a private meeting with British Attorney General Geoffrey Cox. The subject matter of the meeting has not been made public.\n\nStephan Roh, a Zurich lawyer who represented Mifsud, said he has not heard from the academic for some time. He said Mifsud was represented by a London law firm in connection with US investigations. A representative of the London law firm, Howard Kennedy, declined to comment.\n\n(Reporting By Mark Hosenball; editing by Scott Malone and Nick Macfie)", "description": "US spy agencies' critical partnerships with English-speaking counterparts could be undermined by Barr's investigation, Virginia Sen.
