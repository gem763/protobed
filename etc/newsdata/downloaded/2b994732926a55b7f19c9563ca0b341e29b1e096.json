REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nOct 31 was when Britain was to exit the European Union, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than delay Brexit again. But with the UK parliament failing to play along, he\u2019s been forced to ask for an extension and the EU will decide on Monday or Tuesday long it will be.\n\nPresumably unwilling to die in a ditch, Johnson is still holding out hope that parliament will pass his Brexit deal with only a short delay, or agree to a general election that might give him a majority to ram through his deal. So what next?\n\nA disorderly Halloween Brexit looks unlikely. As to the outcome of an election, if there is one \u2014 anyone\u2019s guess. Polls suggest Labour are lagging Johnson\u2019s Tories but these have proved unreliable in the past. So, what we will get for sure is Brextension and also possibly an election. German wealth manager DWS, meanwhile, remind us of another option \u2014 cancelling Brexit altogether. That seems unlikely but DWS reckons chances of this are close to 50:50.\n\nGraphic: Short positions on UK stocks fall as Brexit nears - here\n\n2/JUST ONE MORE TIME..\n\nThere are no guarantees in life, but a 25 basis point Fed rate cut next week is widely considered a sure thing. You can see it in the CME\u2019s FedWatch tool, where odds of a cut in the fed funds target rate to 1.50-1.75% are at 94%. That\u2019s up from about 84% a week ago and 64% a month ago.\n\nThe expectations are also apparent in the yield curve, where the spread between 2-year and 10-year Treasuries has widened to around 18 basis points. It was below 4 bps just after the Fed\u2019s last rate cut. That slice of the curve inverted in August, sparking fears of a U.S recession that would force the Fed to join the negative rate situation of other developed economies.\n\nThe 3-month/10-year yield curve too has turned positive after being inverted for the most part of six months. That\u2019s down to a fall in shorter-dated yields, reflecting confidence the Fed has at least one more cut up its sleeve.\n\nWhat next though?\n\nClues may lie in U.S. company earnings. As we near the half-way mark for the Q3 season, we\u2019ve seen more upside surprises than misses from S&P 500 companies. That\u2019s giving investors a reason to be optimistic about the business cycle. With Friday\u2019s October payrolls report likely to show unemployment at its lowest level in half a century and wages ticking up, not too many folks will want to bet the house on a December Fed rate cut.\n\nGraphic: The U.S. yield curve - here\n\n3/SLOWER, DEEPER, LONGER IN JAPAN\n\nOnce the Fed meeting is past, attention will turn to the Bank of Japan which announces a policy decision the following day. The BOJ is likely to warn markets of slower economic growth than expected and also that policy rates might go even deeper into negative territory. Such messaging would indicate the super-easy policy bias will be extended until possibly end-2020.\n\nGovernor Haruhiko Kuroda says the BOJ could \u201ccertainly\u201d cut rates further and analysts reckon a move to -0.2% or even -0.3% are possible from the current -0.1%. But no one is quite sure what it would take to make that cut.\n\nExport-reliant Japan is already smarting from the trade war and slowing global demand. A higher sales tax rate has just kicked in. And Japanese banks are feeling the pain of a flat yield curve that keeps even 10-year yields negative. But given the BOJ isn\u2019t given to shock and awe, there\u2019s palpably more excitement over Tokyo\u2019s tiffs with the International Olympic Committee on the schedule for road athletics than next week\u2019s policy meeting. More negative policy rates could leave investors as bleary eyed as the early morning marathoners.\n\nGraphic: Japan markets, economy - here\n\n4/BANKS: TIME FOR A BOUNCE?\n\nComing up: A crucial week for European banks. Names such as Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Credit Suisse, ING, BNP Paribas, and Santander will report third-quarter numbers and by Friday, results from 61% of the sector will be known.\n\nEuro zone lenders\u2019 travails are well known, their margins relentlessly pressured by the euro zone\u2019s ultra-low interest rates. No surprise analysts have been downgrading earnings estimates for 19 straight months. Little joy is expected in Q3.\n\nBut \u2014 and there is a but.\n\nWith the Brexit fog starting to dissipate and so much growth gloom already priced in, it might just be time for investors to turn a blind eye to bank margins and focus on the positives. And banks will benefit, albeit only slightly, from tiered ECB rates that should offer a small reprieve from penalty charges they pay on idle cash.\n\nMoreover, bank shares are cheap, carry dividend yields close to 6% and are this year\u2019s worst performing European sector. If an economic recovery materialises, they should be first in line to benefit.\n\nGraphic: Banks versus market - here\n\n5/PREDICTABLY UNPREDICTABLE\n\nFrom Hong Kong to Beirut to Santiago, protests and civil unrest have been raging, posing a headache for investors as well as governments.\n\nHong Kongers have been protesting for greater democracy for five months, while in Chile tens of thousands have gathered for mainly peaceful protests over inequality. In Lebanon, banks have been shut for seven working days as hundreds of thousands flooded the streets in anger at the political class, while in Baghdad a protestor has died after being struck in the face by a tear gas canister.\n\nWith many money managers and risk analysts fearing the world might be on the cusp of its first recession in more than a decade, the root cause of unrest - inequality, joblessness, government spending cuts and corruption - may only deepen.\n\nAll that is upping concerns that governments may unwind reforms and embark on spending splurges to placate the masses. But fiscal loosening in a world swamped with debt and heading into another downturn will unnerve creditors and bond holders, especially those holding government debt as an insurance against recession and a haven from volatility. Investors\u2019 focus in coming weeks may be on the streets of global capitals.\n\nGraphic: Hong Kong stocks have suffered during protests - here", "description": "1/BREXIT IN A DITCH", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444885693&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O16G", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
