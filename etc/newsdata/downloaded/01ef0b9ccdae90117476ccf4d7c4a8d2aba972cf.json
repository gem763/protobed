I think maybe fifteen five-minute stories.\n\n\"As we speak, back at the studio in Bristol, they're building the sets in readiness.\"\n\nImage copyright Peter Lord Image caption Peter Lord and Morph have been touring Orkney's attractions, like St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall\n\nMr Lord and his animation sidekick have been in holiday in Orkney, and posting pictures of their exploits on social media.\n\nHis habit of doing that has spawned a niche craze of people making their own replica Morphs, and posing them at tourist attractions world-wide.\n\n\"It's lovely, it's a charming thing which I totally encourage. But some people aren't actually very good at it.\n\n\"So you get all kinds of weird mutant Morphs appearing around the place, on top of the Empire State building, or something like that.\n\n\"But it's good fun. I love it.\"\n\nImage caption Peter Lord with Morph in Orkney\n\nNo wonder the replica Morphs don't match up to the real deal, when you find out about the work that goes into making those five-minute films. And the time they take.\n\n\"I think an animator these days shoots about six seconds a day. It's slow,\" Mr Lord says.\n\nThat means a minute takes 10 days to film. So each five-minute episode takes 50 days - effectively two months - to complete.\n\nIt takes so long because each tiny tweak or twist has to be photographed separately, then the sequence of pictures blended together into smooth, apparently natural, movements.\n\nThe trick is to combine that technical skill with a sense of the personality of each character.\n\nImage copyright Peter Lord Image caption Morph poses on North Ronaldsay's listed dyke - built to keep the island's unique seaweed eating sheep on the beach\n\nImage copyright Peter Lord Image caption Morph's visit to North Ronaldsay also took him to the island's Bird Observatory\n\n\"With Morph, and with Wallace and Gromit, and Shaun the Sheep, we've developed this idea that it is a proper performance,\" Mr Lord says.\n\n\"And the viewer needs to understand what they're thinking and feeling. Because that's where comedy comes from.\n\n\"And it's visual comedy. You have to do it all by body, expressions, and good visual joke telling. So I look at Buster Keaton films and Charlie Chaplin films, to remember what great silent comedy can be.\"\n\nMorph's stable mate, Shaun the Sheep, stars in \"Farmaggedon\" - due to go on general release in mid October.\n\nMr Lord says: \"In fact, as I've been here in Orkney on holiday, I missed the premiere in London. That just shows how important my Orkney holiday was - is - to me.\"", "description": "The flexible orange character made his debut on BBC1 with Tony Hart in the late 1970s and early 1980s.", "authors": ["Huw Williams", "Bbc Scotland Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/128D/production/_109094740_morphonferry.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
