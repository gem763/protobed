The two units will be temporarily closed the day before the deadline dates.\n\nKyushu Electric estimates the suspension of the two reactors will raise costs by 8 billion yen a month, since the company would need to offset the resulting shortage of power generation with gas-fired power plants.\n\nThe No.1 reactor has been temporarily halted for regular inspection. Kyushu Electric plans to reboot it in early November, before halting it four months later.\n\nAll reactors in Japan were suspended after the Fukushima disaster in March 2011. The government introduced the new rules to resume nuclear power generation, as it aims to have nuclear power provide 20 to 22 percent of the country's electricity in 2030.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Kyushu Electric Power Co will halt two reactors next year due to a delay in implementing anti-terrorism measures required by regulators, in the first such suspension under stricter rules set after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis.
