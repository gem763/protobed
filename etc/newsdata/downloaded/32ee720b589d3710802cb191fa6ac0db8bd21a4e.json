What I learned about hard work, perseverance, and teamwork are lessons I carry with me to this day. I also learned that fair play means recognizing injustice everywhere \u2014 including unfair practices that have gone on for far too long in college and professional sports,\u201d Booker said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAs president, I\u2019ll fight to advance justice for all \u2014 and that includes the professional and student athletes who power this multi-billion dollar industry.
