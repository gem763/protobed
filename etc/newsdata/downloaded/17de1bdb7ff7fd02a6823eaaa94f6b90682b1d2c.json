Shut down completely. Why bother when the world is such a mess and people don't seem to care.\n\nCryptic: Lewis Hamilton has sparked concern from fans after he took to Instagram to share a worrying message (pictured at the Formula One Grand Prix in Japan on Sunday)\n\n'I'm going to take a moment away to gather my thoughts. Thank you to those of you who do give a d**n about the world.'\n\nIt is unclear exactly what Lewis is referring to in the cryptic message, but the Formula One star has long been vocal about his fears for the planet and recently shared a series of messages on Instagram about environmental destruction.\n\nAfter uploading the post, a number of fans tried to contact Lewis through Twitter.\n\nOne wrote: 'Please don't give up on the world. There are people that care, whilst the world may seem c**p at times you have to look for the positives. I promise you there are some.'\n\nSparking concern: The Formula One driver, 34, uploaded a post on his stories on Tuesday, where he told his 13.1 million followers that he felt like 'giving up on everything'\n\nAnother fan typed: 'I am so concerned about Lewis. Hope he is ok.'\n\nBack in August, the racing driver unveiled his plans to open a new vegan burger restaurant chain, in a bid to reduce greenhouse emissions created by livestock.\n\nHe opened his first plant-based Neat Burger restaurant last month selling vegan burgers called 'Neat', 'Cheese' and 'Chick\u2019n'.\n\nLivestock are a major driver of climate change - accounting for nearly 15 percent of greenhouse gas emissions - while producing meat uses land and water less efficiently than crops, according to the U.N.\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\nThe racing driver previously spoke about his own decision to go vegan two years ago. He told the BBC: ' I stopped eating red meat two years ago, I have generally been pescatarian for the majority of the year and now I've cut fish.\n\nGlobal warming: It is unclear exactly what Lewis is referring to in the cryptic message, but the Formula One star has long been vocal about his fears for the planet\n\n'As the human race, what we are doing to the world... the pollution [in terms of emissions of global-warming gases] coming from the amount of cows that are being produced is incredible.\n\n'They say it is more than what we produce with our flights and our cars, which is kind of crazy to think, the cruelty is horrible and I don't necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.'\n\nIt comes after Lewis was denied victory at the Japanese Grand Prix that survived the typhoon by a rare mistake by all-conquering Mercedes.\n\nThe race was instead won by Valtteri Bottas \u2013 a one-three finish that secured the constructors' title for the Brackley-based outfit for a record sixth consecutive time.\n\nLifestyle change: Lewis previously spoke about his own decision to go vegan two years ago. He said: ' I stopped eating red meat, I want to live a healthier life' (pictured last month)\n\nAnd Lewis expects he will have to wait beyond Mexico, the next race on the calendar and one that could be a struggle for his Mercedes team, to secure his sixth Formula One world championship.\n\n'For me, it's never been a case of always wanting to rush things,' he said.\n\n'I think Mexico is generally our worst race of the year because of the way our car is set up and it's going to be a tough one for us. The last few have been pretty shocking, even though we've won the title there.\n\n'I don't anticipate it (the decider) will be Mexico. I think we will be battling for a good few races.'", "description": "The Formula One driver, 34, uploaded a post on his stories on Tuesday, where he told his 13.1 million followers that he felt like 'giving up on everything'.", "authors": ["Connie Rusk For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19743584-0-image-a-85_1571147823938.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
