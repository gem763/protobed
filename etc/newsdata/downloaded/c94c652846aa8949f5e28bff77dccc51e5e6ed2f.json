What is a post-national state? What does that even mean?\u201d she asked.\n\nLiberal Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau said he would fight for Canadian terrorists to keep their citizenship in 2015 https://t.co/YdMHXPH20O \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 14, 2017\n\nMs. Novak insisted that the nations of Europe and of the world need to rediscover their distinctive identities and cultures, which are a source of richness for their own people and for the world.\n\n\u201cWe have our own history, our own characteristics as a nation, and that\u2019s what makes Europe so rich,\u201d she said. \u201cItalians are not like Hungarians. Germans are not like Hungarians. Even Bavarians are not like Hessians or other Germans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have these differences that make us beautiful. We are different and we respect each other. We respect these differences and we don\u2019t want to become alike,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe same goes for relationships between men and women. We want to be equal but we don\u2019t want to be the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe beauty of a relationship between a man and a woman is that we are different, and I think that goes for nations as well,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this globalism, by which everything is homogenized and made the same, destroys many values,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe have to preserve these values. We have to preserve the characteristics of our culture: the Hungarian culture, the Italian culture, the French culture, the German culture, the Swedish culture. It is something people want. They are proud of who they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, we are also all Europeans. But first of all, we are Hungarians. And first I am from Szeged, a state in the south of Hungary, and then I am from Hungary, and then I am from Europe. And in the first place I come from my family,\u201d she said.\n\nCNN Vs Hungary: Leftist Network Clashes with Orban's Foreign Minister on Multiculturalism, Migrants, Soros https://t.co/thcrdydDyl \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 6, 2018\n\n\u201cYour identity is first defined by being a creature of God, being a member of your family, and from the local you go to the global. But you don\u2019t start with the global,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not the part of some global world and from there trying to discover myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not ready to give up our identity, our sovereignty,\u201d she said. \u201cWe value being a member-state of the European Union, but a member-state with equal rights, with our history and our future.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is unfortunately something that many don\u2019t want to accept,\u201d she added, and accounts for some of the hostility felt by globalists toward Hungary.\n\nNovak said she has a hard time getting her mind around the harsh attitudes that many in the European Union harbor toward Hungary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we are used to but I have a hard time understanding it,\u201d she said.\n\nI can understand when there are differences of opinion or approaches. I understand debates and I very much appreciate the value of debate. I understand we have different situations, different cultures, different history. But hatred? That\u2019s something I don\u2019t understand and I have a hard time accepting it. It is hard to understand how people have this passionate feeling of hatred against the government or against the Hungarian people even.\n\nTrying to explain the antipathy, Novak said that for some, Hungary may stand as a tacit rebuke to their own failures, demographic or otherwise.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, they may recognize that they have made some bad decisions in the past and it is very human. When you make a mistake and you discover that the other one was right it makes you feel angry at that person. Human beings are like that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPeople also have a hard time with the direct language used by Hungarians. We say things directly, openly. We say what we think,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat something that liberal politicians, journalists, and some intellectuals are not ready to accept.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany politicians speak a language that nobody understands. We are more blunt, more outspoken, and people appreciate it. Just look at the results of our elections,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut liberals don\u2019t like it,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump: \u2018Twin Brother\u2019 Orban Has \u2018Done the Right Thing on Immigration\u2019, Kept Hungary Safe https://t.co/TY0QTzuiMR \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 16, 2019\n\nHungary is not alone in Europe in standing for the importance of national sovereignty and identity, Novak said, but has a number of important allies.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, Italy. We have allies in the Lega, in Forza Italia, in Fratelli d\u2019Italia. These are the family-oriented parties in Italy,\u201d she said, despite the fact that Italy\u2019s current, unelected government does not seem to represent the will of the people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to see how the government got away from the will of the people,\u201d she said, in reference to the recent formation of a coalition government that excludes Italy\u2019s most popular party, the Lega.\n\n\u201cWe know that the Italian people are behind these political parties and not the government that is currently in office. Every poll backs this up,\u201d she said. \u201cThe recent European elections also showed this very clearly. That lets you see how Italian people feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have an alliance not with the current government but with the Italian people,\u201d Novak said. \u201cThat\u2019s what really matters. Sometimes the will of the people is reflected by the current government and sometimes it isn\u2019t. Maybe in Italy the case right now is that its isn\u2019t. Our real allies are still here representing the will of the Italian people.\u201d\n\nOrban to \u2018Brother in Arms\u2019 Salvini: Hungarians \u2018Will Never Forget\u2019 Your Fight for Strong Borders, European Heritage https://t.co/XkHpAbPhTo \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 30, 2019\n\n\u201cWe also have very strong allies in Central Europe with Poland (we have never been closer than we are now), the Czech Republic, Slovakia\u2026 we have a very strong coalition,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Visegr\u00e1d group is very strong. We agree with each other and we step up together.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have also been very successful, for example with the nomination and election of the president of the European Commission, Ursula Von Der Leyen,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cJean-Claude Juncker wasn\u2019t named to continue as president of the European Commission because he doesn\u2019t represent the values that we hold to be important,\u201d she said. \u201cWe now have Ursula Von Der Leyen leading the European Commission, which is a way better choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is also the mother of seven children and this is not insignificant. If somebody has seven children, she has my respect and appreciation,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018We Need Hungarian Children\u2019: Orb\u00e1n Introduces Tax Breaks for Families https://t.co/sEGCeoujZ8 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 11, 2019\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Globalism is the wrong path for nations to follow and must be resisted, said Hungary\u2019s outspoken family minister, Katalin Novak.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
