In a racist online manifesto posted shortly before he opened fire, he cited the \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas\u201d as the motivation for the massacre.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHe hoped that his act of terror would make Hispanics cower in fear. But Jessica Rodriguez, president of entertainment and CMO of Univision, says that it has only strengthened the bonds within the community\u2014and underscored the importance of service-oriented journalism like Univision\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt absolutely affects us all deeply. Personally, as a Latina as well, absolutely. It affects each and every one of us,\u201d Rodriguez said during an interview for POLITICO\u2019s Women Rule podcast . \u201cBut whether it\u2019s the children on the border, whether it\u2019s what\u2019s happening with our Dreamers, whether it\u2019s how do we prepare our young, growing Latino population to register to vote, how do we prepare and inform them in the elections, how do we get them ready for the Census\u2014we\u2019re going to be there. \u2026 And we\u2019re going to be there not shying away from those topics, because that\u2019s what our community deserves.\u201d\n\nAs the daughter of two Spanish-speaking immigrants, Rodriguez said she was well-acquainted with feelings of not belonging, or of unacceptance.\n\n\u201cAs a Latino, you straddle a little bit this idea of like, \u2018Well, what am I, right?\u2019 Am I American? I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m as American as I should be to my American friends,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cBut then from my Latino friends, I\u2019m not as Latino as they expect.\u201d\n\nShe spoke Spanish at home, but English in the outside world\u2014as her parents wanted. \u201cI just remember very vividly them sitting down with me and saying that it\u2019s like, \u2018Look, you live here in the United States. You\u2019re in New York City. You\u2019re going to make a lot of friends who speak English. You\u2019re going to want to be American\u2014whatever that means\u2014Jessica. But I want it to be very clear about something: You are Latino, and in this house \u2026 you\u2019re going to speak Spanish and you\u2019re going to learn about your culture.\u201d\n\nShe watched the typical late-80s and early-90s teen fare, like \u201cBeverly Hills, 90210,\u201d but also telenovelas and Spanish-language news on Univision. People like her seemed all but invisible in the English-language media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at the Nielsen ratings and I\u2019m seeing what are the top shows in America and again, I\u2019m seeing all these shows that I just mentioned to you, and there is not one Spanish-language show,\u201d said Rodriguez. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Well, every Latino in this country knows you grow up watching \u201cS\u00e1bado Gigante,\u201d or \u2026 one of the great telenovelas.\u2019 \u2026 And it was just like a very frustrating thing to not see that my community and myself was being represented in media.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always this feeling of, \u2018Do I belong here?\u2019\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cAs a Latino, and I think even more now in this era that we\u2019re living in, sometimes there\u2019s feelings of like, \u2018I don\u2019t belong here. I\u2019m not wanted here, right?\u2019\u201d\n\nAll of which has helped inform Rodriguez\u2019s outlook for Univision in 2019 America. She\u2019s bolstered the diversity on the network, bringing more women into positions of power and representing the array of Americans included in blanket terms like \u201cHispanic\u201d or \u201cLatino.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of our morning news anchors became a citizen and what was really \u2026 lovely and inspiring was the fact that we actually covered her ceremony,\u201d said Rodriguez. \u201cShe flew in family from Honduras, and it was really beautiful to be able to showcase that, to bring that in a very real way to our audiences. Because I think with everything, if you see things in the abstract, you may not connect to it. But there\u2019s so much inspiration in terms of just the everyday stories that we see from our own talent, right? That I think again, allows our audience to see themselves reflected in our programming and our content.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the things that is really important when we speak about the \u2018Hispanic population\u2019 is that we have to respect and honor and understand that everybody comes to their duality as a Latino\u2014you\u2019re 100 percent American and 100 percent Latino\u2014in very different ways,\u201d said Rodriguez.\n\nIn that way, Rodriguez\u2019s Univision is sharing a message to Hispanics and Latinos about life in America \u2014 one that needs to be heard, especially now: You belong.\n\nTo hear more from Jessica Rodriguez, listen to the full podcast here.
