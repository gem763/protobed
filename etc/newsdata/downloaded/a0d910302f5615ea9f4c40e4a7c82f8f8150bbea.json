This move was aimed at preventing hardline Brexiters blocking a subsequent withdrawal bill as the clock ticks to October 31, in order to engineer the \"no deal\" scenario that many of them want.\n\nIn principle, therefore, this has made a no deal Brexit less likely by forcing Johnson to request an EU extension.\n\nHowever, if Bercow allows a \"meaningful vote\" on Johnson's deal prior to publication of a withdrawal bill, and if this is passed - thereby removing the need for an extension - there remains the potential that a bill can be sabotaged in the next 10 days - resulting in no deal.\n\nA no deal Brexit also remains possible if the EU refuses to grant an extension, although this is unlikely.\n\nEven if Johnson's deal is passed, many opposition MPs fear a \"trapdoor to no deal\" with respect to trade under the terms of his plan when a Brexit transition period terminates at the end of 2020.\n\nHow long could an extension be?\n\nIf approval for Johnson's bill is delayed beyond Thursday, it will not go before the European Parliament until November - meaning the earliest date for a Brexit signed and sealed on both sides would be December 1.\n\nWhile Johnson was forced to request an extension on Saturday, if MPs back his deal this week that extension will no longer apply.\n\nHowever, there is little time - about 11 days - for MPs to pass all the legislation required to make Brexit happen on October 31, making December 1 again seem realistic.\n\nHave the chances of an election risen?\n\nJohnson has asked for an early election which he seeks to win in the face of what he portrays as an obstructive parliament - but MPs have said no.\n\nHe will continue pressing for a poll - either to rectify his lack of a working majority so he can force through his Brexit vision during any extension or, if his Brexit proceeds, to pre-empt a potential economic downturn.\n\nLabour has pledged to support an election if the threat of a no deal Brexit is removed - which in principle could happen this week - but its poll ratings have plummeted and it may hold out until they improve.", "description": "Despite being snubbed by MPs, Johnson believes he has enough support to push new deal through.
