If they want to do harm to people, they\u2019re not going to follow the law.\u201d\n\nCNN roasted Beto and his confiscation scheme \u2013 SHOCKING, we know. They kept reminding Beto that criminals don't follow laws and won't turn in their guns. Beto refused to answer how he plans on carrying out his scheme. This came hours after Beto promised to go door-to-door. pic.twitter.com/fCa08Q4df4 \u2014 NRA (@NRA) October 16, 2019\n\nO\u2019Rourke responded to Costello\u2019s line of questioning by suggesting that anticipated compliance with a legislative proposal ought not be the litmus test for whether the proposal is adopted.\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation calculates there are more than 16 million privately owned AR-15s in the United States.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
