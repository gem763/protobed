Now at IFM, probably the second-largest Australian listed equities manager, after Vanguard, he has a different and impossibly broad perspective.\n\n\"I sit on the investment committee and I see the way our infrastructure guys model and value businesses. For them, the cashflows are so predictable you can model out 30, 40 years with quite a good level of certainty.\n\n\"Then the argument becomes about 'what WACC (weighted average cost of capital) should I be applying?' 'What's the discount rate for these cashflows?' But if you're in a global tech start-up, the profile of just growing the top-line can be highly uncertain. It's that level of uncertainty which makes the valuation as much art as science.\"\n\nThe past few years have seen active managers struggle from fee compression and a growing preference for passive, causing fund managers to close their doors. But it's been even more painful for value styles given the outperformance of growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If you're a traditional dyed-in-the-wool value manager, you've really struggled,\" Carter acknowledges. \"Take effectively a shrinking revenue pool for managers, and you combine that with a bunch of value managers with very poor performance, and you end up with a bloodbath.\"\n\nHold your winners\n\nHe agrees the capital intensive industries where you have to invest heavily to hopefully make a 10 per cent return are incredibly challenged, and the companies which have done well are capital-light.\n\n\"And if you're a traditional value manager, you haven't been able to see past the fact it hasn't got a single-digit P/E - can't touch that.\"\n\nCarter's small caps strategy has returned more than 5 per cent a year above the benchmark since inception. \"The way technology has shifted, it has meant that the opportunity for shareholder value creation is just enormous,\" he says.\n\nIFM still owns Afterpay, but the fund manager remains keen to find stocks that offer the benefit of industry tailwinds, a global opportunity, capital light business models and a strong competitive advantage.\n\nAppen, Nearmap, Audinate and Megaport come to mind, he suggests, but even great stocks get over-valued and the team actively trades core positions. Also, \"it\u2019s important not to sell winners too early,\" he cautions, \"so we constantly re-evaluate our investment thesis.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt $42 billion in equities, the industry fund is asserting itself in the environmental, social and governance realm. \"I know it almost seems a bit trite now, everyone's talking about it. It's very important. We think it makes good business sense that you consider all environmental, social and governance risks. There's a whole bunch of data that suggests for example that board diversity helps drive superior share price performance.\"\n\nMorally unacceptable\n\nIFM backs the 30 per cent club (30 per cent representation of women on ASX 200 boards) and has written to all the companies with zero or one female director proposing ways for them to tap into candidate pools.\n\n\"The typical push-back is 'we just can't find any women with the right skill set'. Well, you're looking in the wrong place,\" says Carter. \"I won't name names but we will be voting against management teams who are actually obstructive.\"\n\nWhile it works with ACSI, the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, IFM can and sometimes does take a different view.\n\n\"If you're not looking after your workforce, and you're mistreating them, you're going to have high staff turnover. That's going to end up driving greater costs into your business. If you're not respecting your customers, if you're not interacting well with regulators, if you're environmental controls aren't good. We're very strong on the issue of safety. We won't accept companies with poor safety records, we don't think anyone should die because they've turned up for work,\" Carter says.\n\n\"Good safety is a sign of good management, good systems and poor safety is both morally unacceptable and it's bad for business.\"\n\nThe end of shareholder primacy as declared by Jamie Dimon and James Gorman early this year does not sound that provocative to the fund manager.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's become this topic of conversation which is dead right, but the public debate is almost playing catch-up with what's happening in markets, I would say.\"\n\n'Face the new reality'\n\nCarter started investing with his father in the 1980s when the UK was privatising assets. \"He lent me money for the first one which might have been British Airways, and we made some money and rolled that into the next one. So Dad and I went on this little adventure of stagging Margaret Thatcher's privatisations,\" he recalls.\n\nHe is one of five boys, but the only one who caught the investing bug.\n\n\"When I talk to fund managers who have been around a long time, I think there's a lot of frustration with some of the industry trends that we're seeing here in Australia and a lot of people, they kind of think it's a bit unfair, because the world has changed, the revenue pots that used to exist are either shrinking or disappearing.\"\n\nHis advice is to accept it and get on with it. \"Face the new reality, and build products and services for the new world.\"\n\nThe reality is that's much more global in focus, it's lower fee, \"but potentially much bigger FUM numbers\", referring to funds under management. \"And that can work if you cut your cloth appropriately, you've got the right cost structure, you've got good systems, you can still survive and hopefully thrive.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor fun, he still enjoys The Economist, because it is global in scope. He studied philosophy, politics and economics (known as PPE, or a pathway to a career in public life) at Oxford and spent part of his gap year in Kashmir, sharing a houseboat on Dal Lake with Iranian passport forgers who had fled the Iran-Iraq war. (\"They were all passport forgers by necessity,\" he adds.)\n\nCarter's discussion with The Australian Financial Review comes just after the attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure and the Hong Kong protests. IFM has a Hong Kong office and took advice as the situation escalated.\n\n\"A lot of the expat investment community have generally been reporting that it's overblown and the news media made more of it than is the case, but the security advisors that we've consulted suggest that's quite a common view when you're inside one of these situations,\" he says of the instinct to minimise.", "description": "IFM's global co-head of listed equities on why growth multiples are so hard to accept for value investors, even though the opportunity is \"just enormous\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2758%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_298/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/393820394be42a35ed5be88aa18d2a863c0fc976", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
