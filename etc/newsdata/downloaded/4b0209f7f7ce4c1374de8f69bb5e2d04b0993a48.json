It is one of multiple tools immigration officials have deployed to prevent entry by families and others fleeing violence and poverty in Central America .\n\nTrump reacted on Twitter: \u201cBIG United States Supreme Court WIN for the Border on Asylum!\u201d\n\nTrump later tweeted Wednesday night that he had \u201can excellent telephone conversation\u201d with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador about border security and other issues.\n\n[Trump administration moves to restrict asylum access, aiming to curb Central American migration]\n\nEarlier this summer, the court on a 5-to-4 vote agreed to another emergency request from the administration, allowing it to proceed with plans to use $2.5 billion in Pentagon funds to build part of the president\u2019s wall project along the southern border.\n\nNo vote was recorded in the asylum case order, but Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted their disapproval of the court\u2019s action in a strongly worded dissent.\n\n\u201cOnce again the Executive Branch has issued a rule that seeks to upend longstanding practices regarding refugees who seek shelter from persecution,\u201d Sotomayor wrote.\n\n\u201cAlthough this Nation has long kept its doors open to refugees \u2014 and although the stakes for asylum seekers could not be higher \u2014 the Government implemented its rule without first providing the public notice and inviting the public input generally required by law.\u201d\n\nAs is common, the court\u2019s majority did not provide a reason for lifting the injunction issued by a lower court. The issue is likely to come back to the Supreme Court when the ongoing legal challenges have been completed in lower courts.\n\nBut that could take months, and Sotomayor said the status quo should remain in place until then. The change most affects Hondurans, Salvadorans and Guatemalans leaving behind gang violence and high levels of crime in their countries. It could also turn away migrants fleeing oppressive regimes in Nicaragua, Venezuela and elsewhere.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services acting director Ken Cuccinelli tweeted that the Trump administration \u201cuses every tool in the toolbox to try and solve the crisis at our southern border. @USCIS will commence implementing the asylum rule ASAP.\u201d\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt stressed that the challenges continue. \u201cThis is just a temporary step, and we\u2019re hopeful we\u2019ll prevail at the end of the day,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe lives of thousands of families are at stake.\u201d\n\nA record number of Central American families have sought asylum in the United States during the past year, and most have been released to await court hearings, thwarting Trump\u2019s efforts to curb a new wave of migrants. The Justice Department says more than 436,000 pending cases include an asylum application.\n\nThe Trump administration announced the change \u2014 requiring migrants to seek protection in the first country they travel through \u2014 in July.\n\nFour immigrant-rights groups quickly challenged it. A federal district judge in California ruled that the law was probably invalid because it is inconsistent with federal law. He also said it violated the Administrative Procedure Act, and issued a nationwide injunction.\n\n[Appeals court issues split decision on asylum rules]\n\nA panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said the judge went too far. The policy probably violated the APA, it said, but the injunction should be limited to states within the 9th Circuit\u2019s jurisdiction. That meant the rule change could not be implemented along the California and Arizona borders. The other southern border states, New Mexico and Texas, are in different circuits. A U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said the new rule has been applied in those border areas.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar on Monday reinstated the nationwide injunction, saying it was the only way to provide the organizations the relief he said they deserved, and to keep the nation\u2019s asylum law uniform.\n\nEven before Tigar\u2019s latest ruling, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco had asked the Supreme Court to allow the new rules to be implemented everywhere while the legal battle continued.\n\n[Judge reimposes nationwide injunction against Trump asylum ban]\n\nCongress gives the departments of Justice and Homeland Security authority to impose additional restrictions on asylum seekers beyond those in federal law, Francisco argued. He said the new requirement \u201calleviates a crushing burden on the U.S. asylum system by prioritizing asylum seekers who most need asylum in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn turn, the rule deters aliens without a genuine need for asylum from making the arduous and potentially dangerous journey from Central America to the United States,\u201d he added.\n\nThe immigrant-rights groups were represented by the ACLU. They called the changes a \u201cblatant end-run around Congress\u201d and a \u201ctectonic change to U.S. asylum law\u201d that should not be allowed without a full briefing on its merits.\n\n\u201cAllowing the ban to go into effect would not only upend four decades of unbroken practice, it would place countless people, including families and unaccompanied children, at grave risk,\u201d Gelernt wrote. The administration\u2019s claim of a crisis at the border \u201ccannot justify ignoring the laws Congress passed.\u201d\n\nSotomayor seemed to agree. She wrote that \u201cthe rule the Government promulgated topples decades of settled asylum practices and affects some of the most vulnerable people in the Western Hemisphere \u2014 without affording the public a chance to weigh in.\u201d\n\nShe also wrote that she was disturbed that the administration continues to ask the Supreme Court to step in immediately after it receives an adverse ruling in lower courts, rather than allowing the normal legal process to run its course.\n\nShe noted a study by University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck, which said Francisco\u2019s office \u201chas sought emergency or extraordinary relief from the Supreme Court with unprecedented frequency.\u201d\n\nSotomayor wrote: \u201cHistorically, the Government has made this kind of request rarely; now it does so reflexively.\u201d\n\nThe administration counters that no other has had its initiatives thwarted so often by lower courts that enter nationwide injunctions against its policy decisions.\n\n[Chief of U.S. asylum office reassigned as White House pushes for tighter immigration controls]\n\nSince 1980, the United States has said that those who say they are fleeing persecution and violence in their home countries have the right to at least apply for asylum.\n\nMichael Knowles, a spokesman for the union that represents asylum officers and other Citizenship and Immigration Services workers, called the new policy \u201cclearly incompatible with the law that says asylum seekers must have their cases heard, irrespective of their method or route of transit.\u201d\n\nKnowles said the ruling will present the asylum officers who interview those seeking protection in a bind. \u201cIt\u2019s an ethical and moral dilemma for officers who are tasked with upholding our country\u2019s obligations and laws,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe asylum seekers deserve due process.\u201d\n\nOfficers who believe that an asylum seeker would face grave danger if deported to their home country could still potentially refer that person to the immigration court system under the Convention Against Torture, Knowles said. But that person would only be eligible for what is known as \u201cwithholding of removal,\u201d a lesser status that blocks their deportation but does not put them on a path to legal U.S. residency.\n\nThe current case was the Trump administration\u2019s second attempt to change asylum rules.\n\nIn December, the court on a 5-to-4 vote refused to lift a stay on Trump\u2019s first attempt. It would have denied asylum requests from anyone who entered the country at any place other than an authorized \u201cport of entry.\u201d\n\nA different panel of the 9th Circuit said that change was clearly at odds with federal law. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joined the court\u2019s four liberals in keeping the stay in place while the legal battle continued.\n\nThe administration has not yet filed a petition with the Supreme Court to ask it to review the merits of that case.\n\nThe new case is Barr v. East Bay Sanctuary Covenant.\n\nNick Miroff contributed to this report.", "description": "Immigrant advocacy groups had challenged the rule banning most asylum requests along the southern border.", "authors": ["Robert Barnes", "Reporter Covering The U.S. Supreme Court", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dACTir_eu5vEvXYRXGx-am63VPo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LS4NF5WQWUI6TMU3UUUNZAQVJI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
