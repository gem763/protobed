They invested a total of $10 million in the startup, as reported by Asia-focused newspaper South China Morning Post. (SCMP.)\n\nThe exchange, which describes itself as the world\u2019s first to offer physical delivery for bitcoin futures contracts, is targeting Asian retail investors, according to the Post interview.\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO, Mark Lamb, told SCMP that futures contracts which physically deliver bitcoin and other tokens at settlement will benefit traders, who can then be certain that prices have not been manipulated and that they closely track the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. This is because similar, cash-settlement contracts can be more easily manipulated.\n\nLamb refused to comment when asked if the company was offering services to Hong Kong-based customers. This factor could also be key to distinguishing the company from competitors, including BitMEX.\n\nBut Lamb was not so coy about his goal to overtake the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency futures exchange, says SCMP. Coinflex Competitors BitMEX and OKex recently banned Hong Kong users amid increasing regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrency exchange operators globally.\n\nIn November 2018, Hong Kong saw new restrictions imposed by the city\u2019s authorities. Its Securities and Futures Commission proposed a regulatory framework on cryptocurrency exchanges and has said it\u2019s unlikely to grant licences to exchanges that offered the trading of futures and derivative contracts.\n\nThis means that Lamb must walk a regulatory tightrope, which could explain his reticence to comment on the company\u2019s local strategy (including to Decrypt, when we contacted him.)\n\nHong Kong protests are accelerating bitcoin adoption\n\nAdministratively independent Hong Kong is currently at crossroads. It has been in the grip of protests since June, with protestors demanding greater independence from mainland China. But the protests are certainly not deterring investment and interest in cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\n", "description": "International crypto investors, including Roger Ver, have pumped $10m into the HK-based, crypto futures exchange.", "authors": ["Adriana Hamacher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ROFQzFAfnKjUBXHQcO8ufg--~B/aD00NzA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/decrypt_251/40ca2fef991da5c1cd439642bd8ca166"}
