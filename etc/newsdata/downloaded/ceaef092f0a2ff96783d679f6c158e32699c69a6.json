The national party called on Facebook to take down false ads targeting the former vice president. It operates a second, more aggressive \u201cWar Room\u201d Twitter account that has been busy whacking Trump and Republicans. But the size of its following is just a fraction of the size of the national party account.\n\nThe party\u2019s low-key role in the recent fray is sparking a growing sense of frustration, according to interviews with nearly 20 DNC members and other prominent Democrats. There are complaints that the national party isn\u2019t delivering a digital counter-punch, that it\u2019s getting swamped by Republican fundraising, and doing little to combat an onslaught of incoming TV ads targeting Biden on Ukraine. And they lament that Democrats lack a prominent voice who is providing anything like the kind of sustained bombast coming from the Republican side.\n\n\u201cThe DNC should be much more active and vigorous than they have been. It should have been and should now be more even more forceful in its condemnation of Trump,\u201d said Don Fowler, a former DNC chair, who stressed he wasn\u2019t criticizing the party\u2019s current chair, Tom Perez. \u201cThey should consider at least putting out a statement pointing out that Biden has served with honor, has done nothing improper, illegal or unethical and that his record on these kinds of matters is essentially spotless and that Donald Trump is just a lying no-good son of a bitch.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/3257/1155968404_6091759372001_6091757354001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nPart of the problem, defenders say, is that the DNC is working under an unusual constraint. Amid the fallout from the bitter 2016 presidential primary race \u2014 when Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters accused the party of rigging the process for the establishment favorite, Hillary Clinton \u2014 the DNC in 2018 adopted a strict pledge of neutrality in the next presidential primary. As a result, any attempt to defend Biden might be viewed by progressives as a violation of the pledge, and another effort to prop up a preferred candidate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a candidate who has a complaint about what the party is or isn\u2019t doing,\u201d said Kathy Sullivan, former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair. \u201cI don\u2019t think the party needs to do anything. Donald Trump is doing perfectly well jumping off a cliff all by himself. Nobody has to push him.\u201d\n\nStill, critics say that pledge, formally installed by Perez, has dictated the committee\u2019s actions to the point of paralysis. There\u2019s plenty of room for the party to push back on Trump on the issue of election meddling or how he\u2019s complying with an impeachment inquiry without promoting Biden, they argue.\n\nIt\u2019s an opinion that\u2019s held in some quarters of the Biden campaign.\n\n\u201cNo one on our team thinks the DNC should be out there with a giant Joe Biden sign running around town. But there are very few signs of the DNC aggressively pushing back on any of these misleading narratives from Trump,\u201d a Biden adviser said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about us. It\u2019s about the Democratic Party and whoever the nominee is or any of the candidates are. Today, it\u2019s Joe Biden. Tomorrow, it could be Elizabeth Warren or any of the other candidates.\u201d\n\nAs proof of the sensitivity of the issue, relations between the DNC and the Biden campaign grew strained on Sunday when the campaign furnished a TV surrogate with a document of talking points \u2014 one of which was deemed too critical of the party by some DNC officials.\n\nAnother complaint is that the DNC is spending more time refereeing primary debates than aggressively confronting Trump. And those critics don\u2019t think the rebuilding necessitated by the disastrous 2016 election cycle is moving quickly enough. The committee remains saddled in debt and, as of the end of August, had raised just $59.5 million this year compared to the RNC\u2019s $141.4 million.\n\nThe national party is also lagging on the digital messaging front. The GOP has considerably larger social media followings on both Facebook and Twitter \u2014 key arenas where disinformation is spread and media coverage is influenced.\n\nBeyond that, Republicans have already announced they would launch a $10 million TV ad campaign targeting Biden with Trump\u2019s claim that the former vice president and his son engaged in corruption in Ukraine, accompanied by another $1 million in Facebook ads. The president\u2019s re-election campaign is devoting $ 1 million of the anti-Biden television buy in the early nominating states alone.\n\n\u201cIn this situation, if you don\u2019t defend the guy by name and often and vigorously, you\u2019re making him a further victim by the party, you\u2019re not standing behind him,\u201d said a DNC member who asked not to be named, referring to the attacks on Biden.\n\nThe DNC has not announced any advertising pushback.\n\n\u201cA lot of thinking went into not replicating the mistakes of 2016,\u201d said Simon Rosenberg, who acted as a senior advisor to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018. \u201cI\u2019m not sure as much thinking went into re-imagining the DNC\u2019s communications responsibilities in an age of social media, disinformation and Trump.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats point the finger at Perez, claiming he hasn\u2019t been visible enough in countering a massive Republican assault and the DNC hasn\u2019t been aggressive enough in countering the president.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to get down in the mud. But we should be on the offensive,\u201d said one DNC member who would only speak on the condition of anonymity. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve pushed back enough.\u201d\n\nFormer DNC chairman Ed Rendell echoed that sentiment.\n\n\u201cI would like more of a response. And it doesn\u2019t matter what candidate we\u2019re talking about,\u201d said the former Pennsylvania governor and Biden surrogate. \u201cIf Elizabeth Warren is in the lead in all the polls and Donald Trump levels attacks at her that are unfair, the DNC should come to her defense. Whether the DNC has the money to run a robust TV campaign in defense of the Trump TV campaign, I don\u2019t know \u2014 and I\u2019m not sure that they do \u2014 but they could put out a statement.\u201d\n\nDNC War Room spokeswoman Adrienne Watson defended the committee\u2019s work, saying it is wisely sinking its resources into data, tech and organization in advance of the 2020 election and that each presidential campaign was briefed on how the DNC would approach the primary and \u201creceived overwhelming support for this approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cChair Perez and the DNC have spent the last three years battling Trump at every turn while rebuilding the party after a crushing loss,\u201d Watson said. \"Our job is to hold Trump accountable, define him in the battleground states, and speak directly with voters about his broken promises and abuse of power, and that's exactly what we'll continue to do.\u201d\n\nMo Elleithee, who served as DNC spokesman under former Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, defended the committee\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an impossible job,\u201d he said, crediting Perez with being \u201cfairly smart in messaging against Trump.\u201d\n\nFormer DNC Chair Howard Dean said the DNC has two jobs before a nominee is chosen: run a fair primary and a good convention.\n\n\u201cThe DNC ought not to put its finger on the scale. Period. End of discussion.\u201d Dean said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the DNC\u2019s job to attack until after we have a nominee.\u201d\n\nHe added that Democrats would go ballistic if the DNC sprang to the defense of Warren, Sanders or Buttigieg if Trump attacked them. \u201cCan you imagine the howling that would go on?\u201d he said.\n\nNeera Tanden, a former advisor to Hillary Clinton, said Perez has been right to take a back seat to members of Congress like Nancy Pelosi who are leading the impeachment inquiry because that issue is not about politics.\n\n\u201cTrump wants to make this a political battle between the parties,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is a battle about his abuse of office and the Constitution.\u201d\n\nBiden on Wednesday night dedicated an entire speech in Reno, Nevada to Trump\u2019s attacks on him. Biden used the situation both to trash the president and advance the notion that Trump is scared of him.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden won't let Trump get away with gaslighting this country to hide his own wrongdoing, and no Democrat should let him off the hook,\u201d Bill Russo, a Biden spokesman said in a statement. \u201cWe've been pleased to see the example of officials like Sen. Booker and Rep O\u2019Rourke, who stood up for the facts while standing up to Trump, and the DNC who demanded that Facebook take down his ridiculous, false ad. It reminds us why we\u2019re proud to be part of a party of values.\u201d\n\nMaggie Severns contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b9/f2/12c135d54c3a806c35acf3f0c95e/191003-biden-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
