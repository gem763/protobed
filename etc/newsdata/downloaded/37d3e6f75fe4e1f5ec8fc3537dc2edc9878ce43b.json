They last met in his shop in the bustling town market in Pulwama. The atmosphere was tense: extra troops had just been deployed to Kashmir, and everyone suspected something might be about to happen.\n\nThree days later, Ruhi awoke to find that her home, Kashmir, had changed. The Indian government announced it was stripping the territory of its special status and dividing the state of Jammu and Kashmir in two. Millions of residents were placed under an unprecedented communications blackout. Ruhi was no longer able to use her mobile phone, landline or internet. For some, even cable TV services were cut.\n\nAs the days passed, thousands of people were reportedly detained as part of the clampdown, with some taken to prisons elsewhere in India. It is not known how many have been released.\n\nRuhi worried constantly about whether Ahmad was OK. After becoming increasingly distressed, she visited the district hospital\u2019s psychiatry clinic. Inside, patients sitting on wooden benches awaited their turn to consult the only psychiatric doctor.\n\nAbdul Hamid, a clinical psychologist, said there had been an increase in patients experiencing anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and heart ailments. Several patients said they were living in fear \u201cof army raids, tortures and arrests\u201d.\n\nPeople who had previously learned to manage their mental health conditions were now experiencing a relapse, he added.\n\nRuhi is one of them.\n\nAfter two years of treatment for her mental illness, Ruhi felt she had recovered and stopped taking medication. But the uncertainty and tension appear to have revived the illness. \u201cWhen someone says that the situation is not normal outside I feel mentally unwell,\u201d she said.\n\nThe doctor prescribed medicines. And by a stroke of luck, Ruhi found a second source of comfort at the hospital \u2013 she saw Ahmad there.\n\nEvery day more than 170 patients visit the four-room psychiatry clinic \u2013 the only one serving the Shopian and Pulwama districts of south Kashmir. It is likely that far greater numbers need treatment, but many patients cannot reach the hospital because there is no public transport.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People sit in the waiting room at the Pulwama mental health clinic.

It is one year since he last visited the clinic in Srinagar, and he had successfully discontinued his medication. But the clampdown sparked a relapse of his insomnia and anxiety.\n\nAhmad would normally wake at 7am and go to the gym before working from 10am till 6pm. \u201cNow, I can\u2019t sleep until 2am,\u201d he said. \u201cI sleep during daytime because there is nothing to do. [The] gym is also shut.\u201d\n\nHe has been taking sleeping pills for the last seven weeks and is having nightmares. \u201cI fear getting arrested, then what will happen to my family? Or if I am hit by bullets or a teargas shell. I didn\u2019t expect [the clampdown] to be so long and uncertain.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2015 survey by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, nearly 1.8 million adults in Kashmir \u2013 45% of the population \u2013 have shown symptoms of mental distress. More than 41% of the population showed signs of depression, 26% signs of anxiety and 19% showed probable symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nDr Aijaz Ahmad Khan, a clinical psychologist at the SMHS mental clinic, believes the situation is getting worse. \u201cA week after August 5, we saw a change in the patients. We started having patients who had psychological disturbances. It is increasing since then,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is emotional numbness and it is increasing.\u201d\n\nHe said at least 10% of patients have complaints directly related to the clampdown. A year ago, about 70 to 80 patients visited the Srinagar clinic, but Khan said it was now seeing 130 to 150 a day.\n\nThe fragile situation in Kashmir has severely affected women, who have fewer opportunities to venture outside. Romana, 22, from Pulwama, said she was suffering paranoia.\n\n\u201cI was feeling sick while at home,\u201d said Romana, a computer studies student. \u201cIf a person wants to go somewhere, you can\u2019t. People are panicked, so am I \u2026 I feel scared.\u201d\n\n'Society is suffering': Hong Kong protests spark mental health crisis Read more\n\nRomana\u2019s prescription says her situation has escalated \u201cdue to the curfew\u201d.\n\nZoya Mir, a clinical psychology student at the Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in Srinagar, is worried about the future.\n\n\u201cWe have become resilient to pain, feelings, and emotions,\u201d said Mir, who has experienced panic attacks. \u201cThere will be a point where it will be beyond repair.\u201d\n\nPeople do not communicate with their families or each other because there is nothing positive to say, added Mir. Even if there was, mobile and internet services remain suspended for millions. Landlines, though apparently restored, are unreliable.\n\nAs the shadows in the hospital grew longer, Ruhi and Ahmad decided to drive back home together. \u201cIn the car, we will decide our next meeting,\u201d said Ruhi. \u201cWe will meet again now, soon.\u201d\n\nSome names have been changed", "description": "Psychologists say crackdown has led to a rise in people seeking help for anxiety, stress and other issues", "authors": ["Fahad Shah In Pulwama"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88d8b6f4b879d8a28b998c295b23d82206ec8d6c/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2f0980406d1af5efe4ec50c6db5d4af", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
