Lawyers for other major defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nPaul Hanly, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said his clients were pleased that Polster \"almost uniformly\" agreed with their positions on the dismissal requests and whether to admit various testimony.\n\nJ&J has said it will appeal an Oklahoma judge's Aug. 26 order that it pay $572.1 million to that state for the company's role in the opioid epidemic.\n\nPurdue and its owners, the Sackler family, have been in talks on a possible $10 billion to $12 billion nationwide settlement of opioid claims, two people familiar with the matter said last week.\n\nThat accord could include a bankruptcy filing for the Stamford, Connecticut-based company. Purdue and the Sacklers have denied the allegations.\n\nThe case is In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Ohio, No. 17-md-02804.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Bill Berkrot)", "description": "U.S. District Judge Dan Polster, who oversees roughly 2,000 opioid lawsuits by states, counties and cities, said the plaintiffs can try to prove that drugmakers' deceptive marketing of the painkillers caused a harmful, massive increase in supply that pharmacies and distributors did not do enough", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5VK1T6t9ffUTXlbPKMDVfg--~B/aD0zNzg7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/f2cdf46d56b83249312caa2270537ae5"}
