Lack of respect, disloyalty & dishonesty are amongst those things. I know people will come with the \u201cI told you so\u201d, \u201cyou should\u2019ve listened\u201d (maybe it\u2019s true) & more than likely snigger/laugh at my situation.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCiting some words of wisdom from her mother, Jourdan continued: \u2018The reality is my mum raised me to be a strong woman and always give the benefit of the doubt and let people prove themselves to you. Which is what I did.\n\n\u2018I went into this with a genuine heart & real intention to make it work. The love was as real as the hurt is now. But\u2026. I will continue to grow and love myself first. If it doesn\u2019t feel right, it\u2019s not right.\u2019\n\nDanny, 21, is yet to speak out about the break-up.\n\nNews of the split emerged yesterday when a source told The Sun that Jourdan confronted the model about him allegedly \u2018flirting\u2019 with other women.\n\n\u2018Jourdan started to hear rumours he was speaking to other girls behind her back. She confronted him about it but he just laughed it off,\u2019 the insider said.\n\n\u2018Next thing she knows, Jourdan is getting messages from girls saying Danny he\u2019s been flirting with them and then she hears he\u2019s spent all night partying with loads of random women.\u2019\n\nThey added: \u2018She called him and told him it was over and that he wouldn\u2019t be wasting her time anymore.\u2019\n\nDanny reportedly didn\u2019t put up a fight when Jourdan broke off their romance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt comes just a month after Danny and Jourdan moved into their first home together, and three months after they met on this year\u2019s series of ITV2\u2019s hit dating show.\n\nThey\u2019re not the only couple to split this month as Ovie Soko and India Reynolds also ended their romance last week.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
