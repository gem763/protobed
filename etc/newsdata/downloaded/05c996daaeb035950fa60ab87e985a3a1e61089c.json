Along most of its course it ran underground.\n\nAuthorities were conducting routine checks when they found a section of the aqueduct clogged with building waste, including bits of plastic, pots of paint, masonry and old chairs.", "description": "It is hardly in keeping with Rome\u2019s image as the city of \u201cla dolce vita\u201d.", "authors": ["Nick Squires", "Tom Welsh", "Julie Burchill", "Daniel Hannan", "Jacob Rees-Mogg"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2016/07/08/102721457_epa05413990_Models_present_creations_by_German_designer_Karl_Lagerfeld_and_Italian_designe-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqvSDfg1RA02RN50mDz5Ks87btgqH_oSO8Adh5FoWrqg4.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
