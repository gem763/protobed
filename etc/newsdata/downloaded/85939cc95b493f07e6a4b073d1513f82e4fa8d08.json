Chris Collins (R-NY) also pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and lying to the FBI. He'll face up to ten years in prison.\n\nRep. Collins, who served on the board of a pharmaceutical company called Innate, was at a White House event when he read an email informing him the company's major drug was a dud. He reportedly called his son Cameron about the fiasco, and he and other family members were able to avoid hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages by selling their shares.\n\nCollins had previously called the insider trading charges \"meritless.\" He was indicted last year, yet still won his re-election fight. As far as we knew he still planned to be on the next ballot, but on Monday he announced his resignation.\n\nCollins expressed regret during his guilty plea today, especially how he put his son in jeopardy.\n\nIt is \"something I will live with for the rest of my life,\" he said.\n\nU.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman aired Collins' dirty laundry list last August.\n\nU.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman announces criminal charges of insider trading and lying to the FBI against Rep.
