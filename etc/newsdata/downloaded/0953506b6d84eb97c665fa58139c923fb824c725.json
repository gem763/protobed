She said there was a \"concerted campaign\" against her based on \"unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\"\n\nDemocrats questioned Yovanovitch as part of their impeachment investigation into Trump's dealings with Ukraine. The Democratic chairmen issued a subpoena for her testimony after the State Department ordered her not to appear.\n\nShe left without taking questions from reporters Friday night.\n\nYovanovitch is doing a fellowship at Georgetown University but remains employed by the State Department.\n\n___\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nThe chairmen of three Democratic committees say they subpoenaed Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, before she began closed-door testimony Friday.\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel and House Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings said in a statement that they learned late Thursday that the State Department had directed Yovanovitch not to testify. They then issued a subpoena to compel her testimony Friday morning.\n\nIn prepared remarks obtained by The Associated Press, Yovanovitch said that she was told President Donald Trump had pushed to oust her from the position. She left the post in May.\n\nThe chairmen said efforts by the Trump administration \"will be deemed obstruction\" in their impeachment inquiry.\n\n___\n\n12:25 p.m.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told lawmakers Friday that the State Department was pressured by President Donald Trump to remove her from her position.\n\nYovanovitch said in an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press that she was \"abruptly\" recalled in May and told the president had lost confidence in her. She said she was told by an official that there was a \"concerted campaign against me\" and that Trump had pressured officials to remove her for almost a year.\n\nShe said in the statement she was incredulous that the government had chosen to remove her \"based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\"\n\nDemocrats are questioning Yovanovitch as part of an impeachment investigation into Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n\n___\n\n10:15 a.m.\n\nFormer U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch has arrived on Capitol Hill for a deposition in the Democrats' impeachment inquiry despite President Donald Trump's position that his administration won't cooperate with the probe.\n\nYovanovitch was recalled from her post in May and is now a State Department fellow at Georgetown University. Trump said earlier this week that he would block officials from testifying.\n\nDemocrats are investigating Trump's direct pleas to Ukrainian officials to launch investigations of political rival Joe Biden and his family. The Associated Press reported Thursday that a former diplomat, recalling a recent conversation with Yovanovitch, said she was removed after insisting that the requests for investigations be relayed according to long-established protocol.\n\nYovanovitch was recalled from Kyiv in May as Rudy Giuliani \u2014 who is Trump's personal attorney and has no official role in the U.S. government \u2014 pushed Ukrainian officials to investigate baseless corruption allegations against the Bidens.\n\n___\n\n9:30 a.m.\n\nLawyers for Ambassador Gordon Sondland say he'll appear for an interview before a joint House committee taking depositions in the impeachment probe of President Donald Trump despite having been ordered by the State Department not to appear.\n\nSondland attorneys Robert Luskin and Kwame Manley say Sondland will honor a congressional subpoena and \"looks forward to testifying\" Oct. 17. The lawyers said Friday that Sondland has no agenda apart from answering questions \"fully and truthfully.\"\n\nSondland is the sitting U.S. ambassador to the European Union and an employee of the State Department.", "description": "Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch has finished her testimony to House impeachment investigators after more than nine hours of questioning behind closed doors.
