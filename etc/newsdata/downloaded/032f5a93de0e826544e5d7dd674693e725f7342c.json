The rulings will arrive by June, in the midst of an already divisive presidential campaign.\n\nThat will thrust a court that has tried to keep a low profile back into the center of public attention. \u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting term,\u201d Lisa Blatt, a lawyer with Williams & Connolly, said. \u201cAlthough the court will carry on with a sense of normalcy, it will be hard for them to ignore the polarization in the country on the issues of abortion, LGBT rights, guns and \u2018Dreamers.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe spotlight will shine on three justices in particular.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, who by many measures sits at the court\u2019s ideological center, has been increasingly outspoken in defending the court against charges that it is at bottom a political institution. The court\u2019s rulings in the high-profile cases this term may test that assertion.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the 86-year-old leader of the court\u2019s liberal wing, announced this summer that she had been treated for a fourth bout with cancer before starting a demanding speaking tour. Nervous liberals hope that she will remain on the court long enough to allow a Democratic president to name her successor.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, who joined the court last October after exceptionally stormy confirmation hearings, compiled a fairly moderate record last term, voting with President Donald Trump\u2019s other appointee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, in divided cases just 53% of the time. But studies have shown that there are \u201cfreshman effects\u201d on the Supreme Court that do not always predict long-term trends.\n\nThe effect of the retirement last year of Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court\u2019s longtime swing vote, has not yet been fully felt, as last term\u2019s cases were mostly minor. That will now change, said Sarah Harrington, a lawyer with Goldstein & Russell. \u201cAfter a relatively quiet term last year, this term is shaping up to include some politically sensitive issues,\u201d she said.\n\nHere are five cases to watch.\n\nDoes a landmark civil rights law protect gay and transgender people?\n\nOn Tuesday, the court will hear two hours of argument on the momentous question of whether a landmark federal civil rights law protects gay men, lesbians and transgender people from employment discrimination.\n\nIn most of the country, job discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity is lawful. The justices will decide whether the federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, offers nationwide protection.\n\nIf the answer is yes, the consequences would be enormous, said Paul Smith, who argued a landmark 2003 gay rights case and now teaches at Georgetown.\n\n\u201cIt would be huge in the LGBT community to have protection in the private sector from employment discrimination, which is pretty much a rampant problem to this day,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cases before the court \u2014 Bostock v. Clayton County, No. 17-1618; Altitude Express v. Zarda, No. 17-1623; and R.G. & J.R. Funeral Homes v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, No. 18-107 \u2014 were brought by two gay men and a transgender woman who said they were fired for unlawful reasons.\n\nThe question for the justices is whether the language of the 1964 law, which bars sex discrimination, also applies to sexual orientation and gender identity. The employers and the Trump administration argue that the lawmakers who voted for the law did not intend such broad coverage. The workers say that it is impossible to discriminate against gay and transgender people without taking into account their sex.\n\nThe justices\u2019 approaches to the cases may scramble some of their usual commitments, since conservatives are generally more apt to look at the words of a law in isolation and liberals more likely to take account of Congress\u2019 purposes in enacting legislation.\n\nCan the Trump administration strip protection from \u2018Dreamers\u2019?\n\nIn November, the court will consider the fate of nearly 800,000 immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d who were brought to the United States as children.\n\nIn 2012, President Barack Obama created a program to shield them from deportation, and to allow them to work. After Trump took office, he announced that he would wind down the program, saying it was unlawful.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court returns to the bench Monday to start a term that will be studded with major cases on gay and transgender rights, immigration, abortion, guns and religion.
