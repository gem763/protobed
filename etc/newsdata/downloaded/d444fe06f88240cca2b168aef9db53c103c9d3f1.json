I felt like I was going insane, I\u2019d run around the hospital screaming in the night, and I constantly needed sedatives.\u201d\n\nIrene agreed to leave the baby behind after doctors reportedly convinced her to do so.\n\n\u201cThey convinced me, and I signed the baby over to them,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter 18 months, she and her husband contacted the hospital and were told the boy was still alive and had been moved to a children\u2019s home.\n\nBut the children's home allegedly refused to allow them to see the boy, saying he needed constant medical attention and insisting he wouldn\u2019t survive.\n\n\"For the next 15 years there was a constant weight on my heart and I couldn't stop thinking about him,\u201d says Irene.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d watch some TV shows that were related to children and get suffocated by tears . . .\n\n\u201cI would imagine that he would be three years old by now. I would hear some song that played back in the day, and everything inside me would turn upside-down,\u201d she says.\n\nBut life changed when the couple received a note in February telling them they needed to start paying financial support for their son after a change in the law.\n\nThis meant their son was still alive.\n\nHer husband, whose name is not known, went to visit their son in a care centre in Moscow.\n\nThe boy was well looked after and cared for, according to local media. The family then took him home.\n\n\"When I walked along the long corridor, I thought I\u2019d collapse, but when I saw him, I relaxed straight away,\u201d Irene says.\n\n\u201cHis appearance was irrelevant, and as soon as I saw him it was like a weight was lifted from my heart.\n\n\u201cHugging him was easy and calm, and life suddenly was so much easier than it had been in the previous 16 years,\u201d the mom says.\n\nThe family is now taking care of the youngster.\n\nHaving Nikita with her was initially difficult for Irene, she says. He needed care at night in the first few days and a special diet, but after two months Irene says it\u2019s become easier.\n\nThe family can now sense his emotions and recognise the sounds he makes to indicate he wants something.\n\n\"The only regret is why I didn't do it earlier,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in my life and I am happy, and I no longer suffer from depression or struggle to get up in the morning.\n\n\u201cOf course there are difficulties, but they are nothing compared to what I was suffering before.\u201d\n\nChildren's charity owner Yulia Tarasov says the family\u2019s story is inspiring.\n\n\u201cI think this is a unique case [where] a blood relative has adopted such a child. I\u2019ve known him for five years, and we make sure that all of the children in our care have a special adult who acts like a parent,\u201d Yulia says.\n\n\u201cBut of course, this can\u2019t compare with real parents. It\u2019s really amazing that he found a home and relatives \u2013 and especially relatives who are so loving.\u201d\n\nSource: Magazine Features", "description": "\"Doctors told me the boy won't survive.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9465/b863e2c224984a4e91a10d816eb49a0f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
