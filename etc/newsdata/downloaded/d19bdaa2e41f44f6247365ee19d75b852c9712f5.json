If you think Mr. West\u2019s acts were out of character, or if he finds ways to affirm you, even without apologizing, you might not feel threatened. Ms. Swift said she believes in forgiveness for people \u201cwho have enriched your life and made it better.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t believe in forgiveness for everyone: \u201cIf something\u2019s toxic and it\u2019s only ever really been that, what are you going to do? Just move on.\u201d\n\nSome people think that moving on is forgiving. But Ms. Swift is right to insist that there\u2019s a difference. To forgive, you must release your resentment for the right reasons. You must release your resentment because you see that you can repair your relationship.\n\nWhat if you can\u2019t? Ms. Swift advises that you don\u2019t have to forgive and forget; instead, \u201cyou just become indifferent and then you move on.\u201d This is sound advice. She is saying: Hold on to your resentment; just don\u2019t let it hold on to you. Don\u2019t let it consume you. Put it in perspective, and then \u2026 shake it off.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s one way forward. There is another way, and again, Ms. Swift can light the path. In 2013, a radio host named David Mueller groped Ms. Swift as they posed for a photograph. She sued for battery, asking for a single dollar in damages, and she won.\n\nWhat was the point? She hardly needed another dollar. But make no mistake, the verdict mattered.\n\nMs. Swift sued to make clear that her body was not public property, available to any man who wanted to touch it. In other words, she asked the court to reject the message Mr. Mueller\u2019s groping sent. The verdict told Mr. Mueller \u2014 and every man listening \u2014 that no one had a right to her body but her. And because the court applied general principles of battery law, it sent a message about every woman\u2019s backside: Hands off.\n\nLitigation gets a bad rap. But courts give us a chance to call on our community to reject the messages that wrongdoing sends. A lawsuit can let us move forward, without forgiving or forgetting.\n\nBut doesn\u2019t Christianity teach that people must forgive? Not exactly. My friend Len Niehoff, who\u2019s a full-time lawyer and part-time pastor, recently gave a sermon on forgiveness, which invoked Luke 17:3. In it, Jesus says, \u201cIf your brother sins against you, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the teaching of Taylor Swift too. Whatever you make of her music (and for the record, I\u2019m a fan), she\u2019s an astute philosopher of forgiveness.\n\nScott Hershovitz is a professor of law and a professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
