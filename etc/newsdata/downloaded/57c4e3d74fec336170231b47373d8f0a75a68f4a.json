He initially demanded an apology for criticism of his handling of the fires in the Amazon.\n\nWhile humans are largely to blame for the destruction of the rainforest, it's humans who have managed to maintain the healthiest parts, too. People like the Yawanawa, whose Chief Tashka Yawanawa spoke with CBS News. He said the dry season has been particularly bad, a result of the kind of deforestation that has threatened the centuries-old Yawanawa way of life.\n\n\n\n\"Each one of us needs to be responsible economically, environmentally, culturally because otherwise the humanity is just gonna disappear like dinosaurs,\" he said.\n\nIndigenous leader in Brazil says they're facing \"genocide\" in Amazon rainforest\n\nBut Brazil is at a crossroads.
