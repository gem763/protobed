Then figure out how much money you can afford to put toward debt payments every month.\n\nIn any case, you'll continue to pay at least the minimum payment on all debt balances. With the debt snowball method, you'll put any extra money toward your smallest debt until that's paid off, and then you'll tackle the next highest balance. With the debt avalanche, you'll prioritize the highest-interest rate debt first, and so on.\n\nYou must make at least the minimum payment every month\n\nFor either strategy to be effective, you must continue making at least the minimum payment on all balances. Making late payments or no payments can be damaging to your credit score, as can keeping total balances that take up more than 30% of your credit limit \u2014 known formally as your credit utilization rate.\n\n\"The avalanche method is typically the most efficient mathematically, but the snowball method might give you the most satisfaction to keep you motivated,\" said Luis Rosa, a CFP who founded the financial-planning firm Build a Better Financial Future.\n\nRead more: The 'debt snowball' and 'debt avalanche' might sound gimmicky, but they're both highly effective strategies to get out of credit card debt\n\n\"I'm usually an optimizer, but for those with balances on multiple cards, I love Dave Ramsey's snowball method,\" said Andrew Westlin, a CFP at Betterment. \"Getting that first balance paid off builds confidence and momentum, and these small wins are crucial in long-term success,\" he said.\n\nMost importantly, find a strategy you can commit to, said Bobbi Rebell, CFP. \"It's like dieting \u2014 there are popular methods that are great, but the best one is the one that works for each person.\"\n\nMore coverage from How to Do Everything: Money", "description": "The best way to get out of credit card debt is either the debt snowball or the debt avalanche, according to financial planners.", "authors": ["Tanza Loudenback"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7a9de22e22af02481758e3-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
