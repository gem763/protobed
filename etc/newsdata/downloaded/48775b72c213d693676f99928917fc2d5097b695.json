She is one of the luckiest people ever to have lived.\n\nIn a just world, Thunberg would be at the United Nations thanking capitalist countries for bequeathing her this remarkable inheritance. Instead, she, like millions of other indoctrinated kids her age, act as if they live in a uniquely broken world on the precipice of disaster. This is a tragedy.\n\n\u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\u201d Thunberg lectured the world. And maybe she\u2019s right. We\u2019ve failed her by raising a generation of pagans who\u2019ve filled the vacuum left by the absence of faith, not with rationality, but with a cultish worship of Mother Earth and the state. Although, to be fair, the Bible-thumping evangelical\u2019s moral certitude is nothing but a rickety edifice compared to the moral conviction of a Greta Thunberg.\n\nIt\u2019s not, of course, her fault. Adults have spent a year creating a 16-year-old because her soundbites comport with their belief system. It was \u201csomething about her raw honesty around a message of blunt-force fear [that] turned this girl from invisible to global,\u201d says CNN in a news report about a child with a narrow, age-appropriate, grasp of the world.\n\nIt should be noted that \u201cblunt-force fear\u201d is indeed the correct way to describe the concerted misinformation that Thunberg has likely been subjected to since nursery school. There probably isn\u2019t a public school in America that hasn\u2019t plied the panic-stricken talk of environmental disaster in their auditoriums over and over again. New York City and other school systems offer millions of kids an excused absence so they could participate in political climate marches this week, as if it were a religious or patriotic holiday.\n\nWe\u2019ve finally convinced a generation of Americans to be Malthusians. According to Scott Rasmussen\u2019s polling, nearly 30 percent of voters now claim to believe that it\u2019s \u201cat least somewhat likely\u201d that the earth will become uninhabitable and humanity will be wiped out over the next 10-15 years. Half of voters under 35 believe it is likely we are on the edge of extinction. Is there any wonder why our youngest generation has a foreboding sense of doom?\n\nIt\u2019s the fault of ideologues who obsess over every weather event as if it were Armageddon, ignoring the massive moral upside of carbon-fueled modernity. It\u2019s the fault of the politicians, too cowardly to tell voters that their utopian visions of a world run on solar panels and windmills is fairy tale.\n\nIt\u2019s the fault of media that constantly ignores overwhelming evidence that, on balance, climate change isn\u2019t undermining human flourishing. By nearly every quantifiable measure, in fact, we are better off because of fossil fuels \u2014 though there is no way to measure the human spirit, I\u2019m afraid.\n\nThunberg might do well to sail her stern gaze and billowing anger to India or China and wag her finger at the billions of people who no longer want to live in poverty and destitution. Because if climate change is irreversible in the next 10-12 years, as cultists claim, it can be blamed in large part on the historic growth we\u2019ve seen in developing nations.\n\nChina\u2019s emissions from aviation and maritime trade alone are twice that of the United States, and more than the entire emissions of most nations in the world. But, sure, let\u2019s ban straws as an act of contrition.\n\nBoomers, of course, have failed on plenty of fronts, but the idea that an entire generation of Americans should have chosen poverty over prosperity to placate the vacuous complaints of privileged future teenagers is absurd. No generation would do it. Until recently, no advanced nation has embraced Luddism. Although these days, Democrats who advocate for bans on fossil fuels and carbon-mitigating technologies such as fracking and nuclear energy are working on it.\n\nClimate activists could learn something from Thunberg\u2019s honesty, though. She argues that \u201cmoney and fairy tales of eternal economic growth\u201d have to come to an end. The emission cuts that environmentalists insist are needed to save the earth would mean economic devastation and the end of hundreds of years of economic growth. This is a tradeoff progressives pretend doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nAnd Thunberg\u2019s dream for the future means technocratic regimes will have to displace capitalistic societies. We can see this future in the radical environmentalist plans of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s New Green Deal, one supported by leading Democratic Party candidates. It\u2019s authoritarianism. There is no other way to describe a regulatory regime that dictates exactly what Americans can consume, sell, drive, eat, and work on.\n\nOne imagines that most Americans, through their actions, will continue to reject these regressive ideas. One reason they should is so that Greta Thunberg\u2019s generation won\u2019t have to suffer needlessly.", "description": "Sixteen-year-old Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg lives in the healthiest, wealthiest, and safest era that humans have ever known.", "authors": ["David Harsanyi"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Climate-activist-Greta-Thunberg-e1569266587997.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
