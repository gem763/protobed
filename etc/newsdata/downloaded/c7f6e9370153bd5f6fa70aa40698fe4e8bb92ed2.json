Very soon, the females started complaining quietly to us how they were the subject of sexual harassment, naming individual partners and the warning signs to look out for.\n\nOne name kept cropping up: a senior partner who was also high up in the Law Society. At one stage he was talked about as a future president of this august body. He was in charge of recruitment and training, and on the milk round, it was noted how he graduated towards the female candidates and suggested they might care to join him for dinner afterwards. This was a practice he repeated at the firm. His party trick was to ring up a young woman staff member and say he was so sorry, but he was due to be going to a dinner that night with his wife, but she\u2019d unexpectedly had to cancel. Would you mind awfully taking her place? It was black tie, so please, go home, and change into something long. They learned that this was an invitation to be avoided.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI quit City law but stayed in touch with friends who remained and heard their tales of partners trying it on with women employees and subjecting them to all manner of unwelcome approaches, on all manner of occasions: away days, dinners, lunches, taxis, meetings, working late at night or simply, in their offices during the day.\n\nThe City firms were terribly sexist places, and females were subjected to awful behaviour. If that is a blanket condemnation, that\u2019s because it was \u2013 all the firms were the same. One, I recall, had an all-male interview panel that liked to make only the male applicants tell them a joke. The filthier, the better your chance of being hired.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Accountants, banks, trading floors, insurers \u2013 the City was a dreadful place for a woman. But let\u2019s stick to the lawyers.\n\nRyan Beckwith, a partner at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, one of the smartest houses, has just been fined \u00a335,000 and ordered to pay \u00a3200,000 in costs for engaging in sexual activity with a junior female colleague. The solicitors disciplinary tribunal found that he failed to act with integrity and brought the profession into disrepute.\n\nThey agreed that Beckwith, 41, did not initiate sex with the complainant, referred to as \u201cPerson A\u201d, who is in her twenties.\n\nNicola Lucking, the tribunal\u2019s chairwoman, said the judges had not ruled on whether Person A had consented to sexual activity, but only that it was inappropriate for Beckwith to have engaged in sexual activity with a junior colleague who was intoxicated and therefore had impaired judgment.\n\nBeckwith has resigned from Freshfields. He was not struck off, and is free to remain a solicitor. His barrister, though, said the verdict \u201crenders all to dust for Mr Beckwith.\u201d\n\nSuch a case would have been undreamt of in my day. We\u2019ve clearly come a long way since then, and that is to be entirely welcomed.\n\nBut it\u2019s not satisfactory. The tribunal had previously rejected an attempt by Beckwith\u2019s lawyers to have the case thrown out, on the ground that the allegations should be heard by a criminal trial and not a disciplinary tribunal.\n\nHis is thought to be the first of this nature to be heard by the panel, and is being hailed as a turning point in how professional bodies tackle the blurring of professional and personal lives. Andrew Katzen, a regulatory law specialist at the law firm Hickman & Rose, said: \u201cThe allegations against Mr Beckwith were extremely serious. But they are allegations that, only a few years ago, would likely have been rejected by the Solicitors Regulation Authority [which forwarded the complaint to the tribunal] as being outside their remit.\u201d\n\nThe Beckwith saga raises questions. Why has he been allowed to carry on being a solicitor? There\u2019s no doubt the seriousness of the misconduct charge levelled against him, but apparently, it only warrants a fine.\n\nWhile the tribunal did not focus on the issue of consent, the evidence concerning Person A\u2019s intoxicated state and her mental impairment comes as close as possible to the definition of the offence of rape. Surely, this is a case that should be heard before a judge and jury, not a professional disciplinary panel?\n\nNormally, in instances of serious misconduct where a crime may have been committed, the case is dealt with by the criminal process first, and then is considered by the relevant professional body. Beckwith may still be referred to the police for a criminal prosecution if Person A wishes. But isn\u2019t this the wrong way round?\n\nCertainly, as a warning to others, the Beckwith case serves that purpose. It shows, too, just how far the legal profession has travelled, and indicates a determination to reform. All that is hugely positive. But it does not feel satisfactory. By wishing to be seen to do the right thing, professional bodies may be entering difficult, murky waters. Far wiser, surely, to seek clarity via the police and criminal law.", "description": "My first job after university was working as an articled clerk for a City law firm.\u00a0 From memory, six of us joined that year: three men, three women.
