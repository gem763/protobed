Salt Lake goalkeeper Nick Rimando parried a shot by Alberth Elis but Mart\u00ednez ran onto the rebound and, from the end line, slipped a side-netter between the Rimando and the post.\n\nHouston (11-18-4) lost for the eighth time in its last 11 matches.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jefferson Savarino and Corey Baird scored and Real Salt Lake beat the Houston Dynamo 2-1 on Sunday to clinch a playoff berth.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
