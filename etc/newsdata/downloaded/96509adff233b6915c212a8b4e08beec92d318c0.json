The thieves also wrote \"traitor\" in green paint across photographs of the man dubbed the \"father of the nation\".\n\nMangaldeep Tiwari, the caretaker of Bapu Bhawan, told The Wire: I opened the gate of the Bhawan early in the morning because it was Gandhis birthday. When I returned at around 11 pm, I found the mortal remains of Gandhi missing and his poster was defaced. This is shameful.\n\nA small, hardline subsection of Hindus view Gandhi as a traitor for his advocacy of Hindu-Muslim unity.\n\nGandhi, who was born in 1869, played a key role in India's fight for independence. He was assassinated by a Hindu radical on Jan. 30, 1948, just a few months after he led India to freedom from British rule through a non-violent struggle.\n\nSchool children celebrate the 150th anniversary of Gandhi's birth Credit: NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images More\n\nGandhi's body was cremated according to Hindu tradition, and his ashes were divided and distributed to friends and family, as well as being toured throughout India for ceremonies intended to heal a nation in mourning.\n\nIt is unclear precisely how many collections his ashes were divided into as, even 65 years after his passing, collections continue to be discovered.\n\nHis ashes were distributed as far and wide as Pune, and the Aga Khan Palace - where he was once held prisoner - as well as the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Los Angeles, California. Some were also scattered in the Arabian Sea by Gandhis great-granddaughter, Nilamben Parikh, and some off the coast of South Africa by a family friend.\n\nDistrict Congress chief and complainant Gurmeet Singh, told The Wire: Gandhis ideology has been shamed again. This unlawful act must have been done by the followers of Gandhis assassin Nathuram Godse. This madness must stop. I urge Rewa police to check CCTV cameras installed inside Bapu Bhawan and nab the accused.\n\nIndia celebrated the anniversary of his birth by organising cleanliness drives, film screenings and making a giant spinning wheel made out of plastic waste.", "description": "Some of Mahatma Gandhi's remains have been stolen from a memorial centre on what would have been his 150th birthday.", "authors": ["Pepper Wilde"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/J_ARFZ5zLBLS6ivx1aeCuQ--~B/aD03Nzg7dz0xMjQ2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/20a85458ce9a26608c83279735f9b193", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
