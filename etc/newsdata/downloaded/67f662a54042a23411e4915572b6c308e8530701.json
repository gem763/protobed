The agents responded to the area and apprehended the groups. Members of the group advised the agents that two men may have drowned in the river, according to information provided by Rio Grande Valley Sector.\n\nAgents found one of the men, a Salvadoran national, and learned he lost consciousness while in the water. Another person allegedly performed CPR on the man before agents arrived. Agents called for a Border Patrol EMT to evaluate the migrant. After a medical assessment, the BPA-EMT called for an ambulance to transport the Salvadoran migrant to a local hospital.\n\nAgents also called for an ambulance for a Guatemalan migrant who also nearly drowned while crossing the border illegally.
