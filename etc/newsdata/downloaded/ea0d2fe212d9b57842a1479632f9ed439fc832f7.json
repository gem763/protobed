The difference is it now has a home.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nTottenham\u2019s magnificent new stadium is the first ever to be purpose built for American Football outside of the United States.\n\nWhen you look at the glistening glass exterior, emblazoned with the logos and quarterbacks of the travelling teams, with its very own NFL store and its tailgating park, you could be forgiven for thinking you\u2019re in Atlanta or Dallas, and yet the atmosphere - and the rain which fell as the crowds made their way through the turnstiles - is still distinctly British. It feels like everything the NFL has tried to bring to the UK - both the culmination of years of hard work and the first step of a giant revolution to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe transformation from football; English to football; American is so complete that when you take your seat it is hard to imagine Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen trotting out of the tunnel every other week. This feels like a real NFL stadium, worthy of any of the league\u2019s finest franchises. The field itself is ever present, just hidden by the retractable football pitch. There are separate, larger dressing rooms for American football, the big screens replay every down in vibrant detail and the atmosphere, with no disrespect to Wembley, was on another level to what we\u2019ve experienced in this country before.\n\nFans arrive at the stadium ahead of the match Credit: GETTY IMAGES\n\nIt was helped by a far more partisan crowd. While jerseys from all 32 teams were present, as always, they may have been outnumbered by Bears and Raiders shirts. Bears fans in particular - a combination of die-hard Chicagoans and British converts to one of the sport\u2019s most storied franchises - were raucous. Derek Carr must have struggled to make his commands heard on third down, so deafening was the crowd, and the stadium reached fever pitch on one especially exhilarating play, when Bears running back Tarik Cohen exploded for a 71-yard punt return.\n\nBears head coach Matt Nagy was understandably prickly after the game, considering the way his team let the result slip through their fingers, but couldn\u2019t help but glow when asked about the setting.\n\n\u201cBeautiful, absolutely gorgeous,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s the first thing you do, you walk in here and you just see it. It\u2019s state of the art. It\u2019s top notch. You talk about doing things the right way, I mean it blows you away. It\u2019s absolutely phenomenal.\u201d\n\nA setting worthy of its very own, permanent NFL franchise? It\u2019s hard to argue against it. Until now the London series has always felt like American Football visiting Britain. On Sunday it felt like it was truly belonged. It felt like it was home.", "description": "It\u2019s 3.30pm on a Sunday afternoon and Seven Sisters Road is a procession of American Football shirts.
