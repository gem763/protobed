On Wednesday, Bloomberg News, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that Trump discussed easing sanctions on Iran in a move to sure a meeting with Hassan Rouhani, Iran\u2019s president, later this month.\n\nBolton\u2019s sudden firing \u201ccould be a catalyst for a material de-escalation in the Iran [nuclear] standoff\u201d that could bring back around 700,000 barrels a day of Iranian barrels onto the world market, possibly by the first quarter of 2020, said strategists at RBC Capital Markets, led by Helima Croft, in a recent note.\n\nBolton\u2019s departure news led to a decline on Tuesday, and reported talk of easing Iran sanction prompted an even sharper fall Wednesday. October West Texas Intermediate crude CLV19, +0.54% settled at $55.75 a barrel, down $1.65, or 2.9%, on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday. November Brent crude BRNX19, +0.41% lost $1.57, or 2.5%, to $60.81 on ICE Futures Europe.\n\nJames Hatzigiannis, senior strategist at Long Leaf Trading Group, said there\u2019s a chance that Trump could \u201csoften\u201d the current sanctions on Iran to \u201centice a negotiation meeting with Iran.\u201d\n\nTrump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal between Iran and a group of world powers, in May 2018. In retaliation, Iran has since violated elements of the deal that limit Tehran\u2019s development of its nuclear program.\n\nRBC Capital Markets\u2019 Croft said Trump may consider some form of a financial lifeline for cash-strapped Iran, noting that France has previously proposed providing a $15 billion credit line, backed by around 700,000 barrels of oil.\n\nThat arrangement would require the U.S. to \u201cgrant waivers to allow foreign refineries to legally take the Iran product\u201d and in return, Iran would agree to forego further breaches of the nuclear deal, she said.\n\n\u201cWe think the odds of a near-term diplomatic off-ramp have increased\u201d to around 35%, she said, referring the potential for some sort of deal, but \u201cit is by no means certain.\u201d\n\nFor now, \u201cIran is showing no willingness to speak [with the U.S.] until the sanctions are pulled off,\u201d Hatzigiannis said. However, if Trump softens the sanctions and talks with Iran did not go well, he expects Trump to \u201ccome down with harsher sanctions.\u201d\n\nStill, news that Trump is considering easing Iran sanctions is likely to \u201covershadow\u201d the meeting Thursday of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, or JMMC, said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.\n\nThe JMMC monitors compliance with output reductions set by an OPEC+ agreement that began at the start of this year. OPEC and its allies had agreed to cut a collective 1.2 million barrels of oil production from late 2018 levels to help balance the market.\n\nThe meeting \u201chas the potential to change the game,\u201d said Scott Gecas, chief market strategist at Walsh Trading. \u201cWith the U.S. continuing to increase output and if sanctions on Iran ease, this will bring more supply to the market.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s no change to OPEC\u2019s production cuts, that would \u201cnot be enough to offset the increased supply from Iran,\u201d he said. Then again, if OPEC sees the easing of sanctions as a threat, they\u2019ll cut output further, said Gecas.\n\nUncertainties will plague the market until it gets further clarification on Iran sanctions.\n\n\u201cWhat the cartel discusses is a moot point, given how the supply landscape could change very quickly,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cWith an IPO fast approaching, Saudi Arabia will be keen to support oil prices,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the latest developments, their production cut may be getting a bit larger.\u201d", "description": "The chances of a deeper oil production cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies has seen an uptick in just the last...", "authors": ["Myra P.
