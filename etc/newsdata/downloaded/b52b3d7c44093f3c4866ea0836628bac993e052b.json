As chief operating officer of Radius Developers, he\u2019s struggling to fund construction of apartment complexes because of a liquidity crunch in the nation\u2019s bloated shadow-banking sector.\n\n\u201cReal estate is a sitting duck,\u201d said Shah. \u201cThe timing is very crucial as the slowdown has hit the real estate market quite hard. The industry can\u2019t service interest, new interest, additional interest, because there is no cash flow.\u201d\n\nRadius and hundreds of other developers relied on loans from what India calls non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) to fuel a five-year property boom. That came to a halt a year ago with the default of one of the shadow banking sector\u2019s leading lenders, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. The resulting credit squeeze has left builders such as Radius and Omkar Realtors & Developers Pvt. looking for support, or, like scandal-hit Housing Development & Infrastructure Ltd., filing for bankruptcy.\n\nThere are $63 billion of stalled residential projects across the country, according to Anarock Property Consultants, and their developers have become locked in a downward spiral with shadow banks. As lenders stop new credit, builders are forced to offload properties. Prices fall, causing more real estate loans to turn sour, pushing more shadow banks toward default.\n\nIn turn, that has cast a shadow on traditional banks and dried up funding to other businesses, putting more stress on an already slowing economy.\n\nFor Radius, the crunch started when one of its main lenders, Dewan Housing Finance Corp., shut off new loans as it attempts to restructure some $12.7 billion debt to avoid bankruptcy. Shah said he gained a temporary reprieve by selling a project to Blackstone Group Inc., but like all builders, his company needs cash to operate while projects are being built.\n\nEdelweiss Financial Services Ltd. and Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd., which have some of the largest exposures to the sector, are also tightening funding.\n\nThe risks of exposure to real estate were underlined by the scandal surrounding HDIL. The Reserve Bank of India abruptly imposed withdrawal curbs on a small cooperative bank that it said had under-reported loans to the developer. The decision triggered panic withdrawals from the bank, prompting the RBI to issue a statement to reassure the public that the banking system is \u201csafe and stable.\u201d\n\nThe stresses in the banking industry are an added headache for the RBI, which cut rates by 25 basis points on Friday to counter slowing growth.\n\nSome commercial banks that lent to developers and shadow finance firms -- notably Yes Bank Ltd. -- have been caught up in the crisis. Banks had boosted overall lending to NBFCs by more than 50% over the past five years, to about $96 billion or nearly 8% of their total exposure.\n\nYes Bank shares have led the declines in bank stocks, dropping more than 80% in the past six months, including a 12% slump this week. Its proportion of stressed loans could rise to more than 12%, from a net bad debt of 2.9%, according to Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Ashish Gupta.\n\nYes Bank Chief Executive Officer Ravneet Gill said his bank only had exposure to three NBFCs. \u201cThere is a general perception that there is a closer linkage between Yes Bank and NBFCs than actually exists,\u201d he said in an interview on Thursday.\n\nREAD: How to Put India\u2019s Shadow Banks on Firmer Ground\n\n\u201cThe biggest risk is, at its core, a liquidity crisis. A liquidity crisis left unattended balloons into a solvency crisis,\u201d said former Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao, who steered India through the 2008 global downturn. While he doesn\u2019t see any local bank going down in the current scenario, \u201csome weak non-bank finance companies should be allowed to fail for the entire financial system to come out stronger,\u201d he said.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s administration and the RBI have taken steps to try to improve cash flow to shadow lenders, including allowing banks to lend more to the sector, providing partial credit guarantees, and easing banks\u2019 mandatory liquidity ratios.\n\nRBI Governor Shaktikanta Das reiterated on Friday that the central bank has the top shadow lenders under its \u201cintense\u201d supervision. He had said last month that the RBI is closely monitoring the top 50 NBFCs, which contribute about 75% of the sector\u2019s loans, and it won\u2019t allow another systemically important NBFC to fail.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Ashish Shah is caught in the middle of India\u2019s latest financial crisis.
