But when he tried to retrieve it, he accidentally lodged the pot deeper into his nasal cavity and assumed that he had unknowingly swallowed it at some point.\n\nAs it turns out, the nose weed never quite made it to the man\u2019s throat, and instead developed into a gray calcified lesion measuring 19 by 11 millimeters. Rhinoliths are uncommon, but have been known to form around blood clots or foreign objects that have entered the nasal cavity, such as beads, cotton, or plant matter.\n\nThe patient with the marijuana-based rhinolith said that he had a history of nasal obstruction and frequent sinus infections, but the source of those symptoms wasn\u2019t noticed until he sought treatment for painful headaches. A CT scan of his brain revealed the \u201crubber capsule containing degenerate vegetable/plant matter,\u201d as Smith\u2019s team describe it, which doctors removed under general anaesthesia.\n\n\u201cAt a three-month follow-up, the patient reported complete resolution of his sinonasal symptoms,\u201d the authors said.\n\nWhile this is the first instance of a marijuana-based rhinolith, a 2007 study reported that a 21-year-old man had a \u201chardened mixture of codeine and opium wrapped in a small sheet of nylon\u201d removed from his nose.\n\nSmith\u2019s team notes that while smugglers generally swallow drug packages for later recovery, the new case \u201cdemonstrates a likely underreported pathology of a rhinolith\u201d for the rare few who opt to carry substances in their nostrils.", "description": "The man thought he accidentally swallowed the bag when he smuggled it into prison in his right nostril.
