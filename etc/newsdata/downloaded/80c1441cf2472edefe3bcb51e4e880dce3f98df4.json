This surge lost short-sellers over $1 billion, which initiated a \"short burn\" that lifted this stock back into the $300 range, but there is more to the story that could take this stock to new highs.\n\nAnalysts are increasingly optimistic about this stock and have continued to raise expectations and propelled TSLA into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It is reasonable to assume that these estimates will continue to rise as analysts adjust their models for the most recent company optimism.\n\nEarnings Review\n\nTesla has a history of either misguiding analysts or leaving them in the dark regarding future quarterly results. This most recent quarter was no exception.\n\nI sit here and think to myself, what are the possible reasons that an investor relations team would want such significant surprises in their earnings reports? The conclusion that I came to is that they want to keep TSLA relevant, and with huge swings in share prices from big headlines and big earnings surprises keeps TSLA at the forefront of traders' minds.\n\nI know that traders looking for short term gains are only a small subset of the investor community. Still, it makes up a large portion of daily volume, and volatility increases volume, which in turn increases liquidity.\n\nRegardless, this most recent earnings report proved to be a significant surprise on the EPS side of the equation. Analysts were expecting a sizable loss this quarter, but instead, they demonstrated sizable profits. Some of this can be attributed to the hampered expectations from a disappointing Q2, and some could be attributed to an investor relations team that likes surprises, up or down.\n\nThe biggest news coming out of Q3 earnings, from my perspective, is the ahead of schedule Shanghai Gigafactory. Ahead of schedule is something you rarely hear from Tesla, who has had a history of overpromising and under-delivering. This year may be the year that they finally hit their targets and keep their promises.\n\nThe overzealous and eccentric CEO Elon Musk promised to have 360,000-400,000 vehicles delivered by the end of fiscal 2019. This was something quickly shrugged off by investors, as this visionary's grandiose expectations are often unattainable.\n\nTesla has been able to deliver over 95,000 cars in Q2 and 97,000 in Q3, which were both record delivery figures for the company. If the company can deliver 105,000 cars in Q4, then it will have hit Musk's seeming unattainable guidance.\n\nShanghai Gigafactory\n\nChina is the largest electric vehicle market in the world by a substantial amount, almost doubling that of the US. Tesla's new Shanghai plant will give the company direct access to this market and allow them to cut costs substantially. In a letter to shareholders, Elon said that this factory was 65% cheaper than any Model 3 factory built in the United State's\n\nThe cost to the Chinese consumer will fall due to expect cost reductions and also allow the firm to bypass the tariffs associated with the US-China trade conflict.\n\nThe Gigafactory is currently in trial production and plans to have the plant fully operational this quarter. In phase 1, Tesla expects to be producing 250,000 cars for China annually and to reach its capacity of 500,000 units in the years moving forward.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Tesla (TSLA) Rally Is More Than A Short Sqeeze", "authors": ["Daniel Laboe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N.S_xR6MN9WfFMXF4TaXTw--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/6a67bb2cb7283fe4583a85e3c339567e", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
