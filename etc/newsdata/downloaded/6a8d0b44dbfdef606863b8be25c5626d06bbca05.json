REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - A no-deal Brexit would \u201cinevitably disrupt\u201d fresh food supplies in Britain because delays at ports would throw just-in-time deliveries into chaos, the chief executive of supermarket group Sainsbury\u2019s (SBRY.L) said on Friday.\n\nMike Coupe said the Oct. 31 Brexit date could not come at a worst time for supermarkets because warehouses were already full with Christmas produce and more of the supply of fresh salad had switched to southern Europe.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that the government had been \u201cmassively accelerating\u201d its preparations, and the country would \u201cbe ready\u201d if Britain left the EU without a deal at the end of October.\n\nAsked if plans were in place that meant disruption to food supplies could be ruled out, Coupe told BBC radio : \u201cI disagree with that wholeheartedly, the reality is there will inevitably be disruption, simply because we\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d\n\nOther supermarket bosses said on Thursday that Britain was unlikely to run out of essentials like toilet paper in the event of a no-deal Brexit but some fresh fruit and vegetables could be in short supply and prices might rise. [nL5N26330Q]\n\nSenior retail figures have also said that the government\u2019s demand for supermarkets to prepare for a no-deal Brexit by stockpiling food was stoking anger in the industry, with bosses saying they should not be blamed if people can\u2019t find everything they want on the shelves.
