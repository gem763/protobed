Daniel Hunt had lost everything in a house fire earlier this month, so his classmates had held a secret toy drive for their pal.\n\nDaniel was speechless for a second after the big reveal Friday. Then he said, \u201cI love it! Everyone come here,\u201d and he opened his arms as his classmates rushed him for a \u201clarge group hug,\u201d school counselor Kelly Jones told ABC News.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing to witness the excitement these third-grade kids had while sneaking in toys\u201d for the drive, Jones said. \u201cThe entire week, they couldn\u2019t love him enough. People were holding doors for him, getting his pencil ready for him each morning, taking his chair down from the desk for him to sit in and swarming him at recess.\u201d\n\nDaniel later told his grandmother Marsha Hunt that he was \u201chappy crying.\u201d\n\nShe said in a message on Facebook: \u201cI love that his friends gave from their heart to this special little grandson. They were so excited to give! He has looked at each and every toy, big and small, and he loves them all. Thank you so much!!!!!!\u201d", "description": "Daniel Hunt told his grandmother that he was \"happy crying.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d92c740210000510050d9e2.png?cache=mccmrotbmj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
