The jury said Dr. Georgulas had the right to \u201ctransition\u201d her son, who she has reportedly renamed \u201cLuna.\u201d\n\nAs part of Thursday\u2019s ruling, Judge Cooks also placed a gag order Jeffrey Younger to prevent him from discussing the case with the media and said he no longer must pay for attorney fees.\n\nJeffrey Younger emerged from the Texas courtroom with a smile on his face and when asked if he was happy about the judge\u2019s ruling, he could be heard saying \u201cyes\u201d before being ushered away.\n\nConstance Stanton, a family friend of Jeffrey Younger, told reporters that \u201cprayers have been answered\u201d regarding the ruling.\n\nThe development comes after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) announced that his state is investigating the status of James Younger. \u201cFYI the matter of 7 year old James Younger is being looked into by the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office and the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services,\u201d Abbott wrote on Twitter Wednesday evening.\n\nThe case has garnered widespread attention from other Texas conservatives, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R) and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R), who expressed concern about the young boy.\n\nCruz wrote on Twitter Wednesday: \u201cThis is horrifying & tragic. For a parent to subject such a young child to life-altering hormone blockers to medically transition their sex is nothing less than child abuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is heartbreaking and sets a horrible precedent,\u201d Crenshaw said of the matter this week. \u201cA 7-year-old can\u2019t possibly make this decision or understand it. Parents should know better. I hope this father receives the public support he needs.\u201d", "description": "A judge ruled Jeffrey Younger will have\u00a0joint guardianship with his son's mother, granting him the right to share medical decisions for his child.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/jeffrey-younger-screen-cap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
