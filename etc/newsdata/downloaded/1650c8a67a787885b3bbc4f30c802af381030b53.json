Whether it's about the fizzy drink you should never order; the best way to beat jet lag, or even the perfect snacks to take on board.\n\nNow, a travel doctor has revealed the surprising reason why you should never chew gum on a flight, despite the fact many passengers believe it to help stop your ears popping as you gain altitude.\n\nSpeaking to MailOnline, they explained that chewing gum can increase the amount of gas in your stomach, which in turn makes you bloat - and in turn contribute to that sluggish plane feeling.\n\nPhoto credit: Patrick Foto - Getty Images More\n\n\"Forget about chewing gum to stop your ears hurting at take-off or landing. Chewing makes us swallow more air \u2013 just like fizzy water,\" the travel doctor explained. \"It\u2019s also a choke-risk in turbulence or bumpy landings. Wiggling your lower jaw and doing some big fake yawns sorts your ears out more safely.\"\n\nThey went on to explain why it's for the same reasons you should try to avoid fizzy drinks. \"Excessive gas is never fun on a plane. So why put extra oxygen into your system? Cutting out fizzy water (and saying no to Champagne, if you\u2019re lucky enough to be offered it) makes everyone more comfortable.\"\n\nWe'll leave our Wrigley's at Gatwick, then.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Flightlevel80 - Getty Images More\n\nInterestingly, this comes as an Emirates cabin crew member also revealed to Cosmopolitan UK the best way to avoid feeling puffy after a flight. \"Alternate your seat position between upright and reclined at different points throughout your flight to avoid fluid pooling under your eyes,\" they explained. \"You can also get rid of under-eye bags and puffiness by holding a wet napkin or ice cube under your eyes to help reduce any swelling.\"\n\nBeyond your face, \"Walk through the cabin during your flight or do circulatory exercises in your seat to get your blood flowing. This will relax your muscles and help you avoid any post-flight swollen ankle.\"\n\nConsider us de-puffed.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "A travel doctor explains all", "authors": ["Dusty Baxter-Wright"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/E80pyf2gyZdPGUmgsvU_Aw--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/d00ac5a9b29cf12605862b2cab894a13", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
