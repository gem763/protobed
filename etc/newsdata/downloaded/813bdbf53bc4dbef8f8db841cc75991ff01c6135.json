They have four daughters, aged between ten and 16.\n\nICE CUBEs for eye bags\n\nI\u2019m a night owl, so I usually stay up until 2am, then wake up at 6am and have a power-nap in the day. If I get eye bags, I press a few ice cubes (inside a sealed freezer bag, wrapped in a tea towel) under my eyes for five minutes before bed. The skin looks quite red just after, but I find this helps to soothe puffiness so I look much fresher the next morning. I do it for special occasions.\n\nSandra Prince, who has four daughters aged between ten and 16, presses ice cubes into her face to get rid of the eye bags\n\nTWO-STEP GLOW\n\nEvery night, I apply Bio-Oil (\u00a39.99, boots.com) to my face instead of moisturiser \u2014 it\u2019s packed with hydrating vitamins and natural oils. My daughters say I look so shiny! But it soaks in, and my skin feels smoother and plumper. I also take Holland & Barrett Vitamin E 1,000mg (a high dosage) capsules every other day (\u00a345.99). They work so well that my skin gets too oily if I take them daily.\n\nTAKE A HAIR BREAK\n\nSince going grey, I have to colour my roots every two weeks. However, it\u2019s important to give your hair a break from damaging treatments. So, after six months of perming and colouring, I stop \u2014 and get full extensions put in for the next six months. It costs \u00a3200 to get them re-attached every six weeks as they grow out. But it\u2019s worth it. I love changing my image.\n\nDESIGNER bargains\n\nI love shopping online at youthful High Street brands such as ASOS, Pretty Little Thing, Missguided and Zara. But I like to mix them with designer pieces, which I buy in sales at the Bicester Village outlet in Oxford. I\u2019ve found some amazing bargains there, by Burberry, Versace, Ralph Lauren. The key is to go early, as soon as the shops open.\n\nMIDLIFE FITNESS CHALLENGE\n\nI\u2019ve been working out at home for years, but find it harder to stay in shape now. So I see a weekly personal trainer and have cleaned up my diet: I eat lean meat or fish with vegetables for most dinners \u2014 plus one \u2018cheat day\u2019. I\u2019ve lost 1 st since June and feel fitter than ever. I recently did a 1,000-squat challenge on You Tube in under an hour!", "description": "Sandra Prince, 54, presses ice cubes into her eye bags each morning to get rid of them - after four hours sleep - and colours her hair roots every two weeks to hide the greying hairs.", "authors": ["Florence Scordoulis For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/21/19371146-0-image-a-71_1570394736728.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
