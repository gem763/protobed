DONATE NOW.\u201d And an even smaller portion was spent trying to persuade voters swing voters by telling them about something Joe Biden didn\u2019t actually do or say. (The Trump campaign says the ad is accurate.)\n\nThis focus on prospecting is according to Quartz\u2019s review of previously-unreported data showing the Trump campaign\u2019s own categorization of the ads.\n\nOf at least $1.7 million spent by Trump since September 24 on ads about impeachment, at least $1.59 million was earmarked for ads designated as prospecting ads. (Facebook reports per-ad spending in broad ranges.) The ads were paid for by The Make America Great Again Committee, which is a joint fundraising committee run by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. The Trump campaign declined to comment when asked about Quartz\u2019s analysis.\n\nAnd most of that was spent on ads that the Trump campaign targeted with \u201cbehavioral targeting\u201d\u2014that is, showing it to ads to people whose web browsing history Facebook thought indicated that they were \u201cinterested in Donald Trump\u201d or \u201cinterested in Mike Pence.\u201d\n\nAnnie Levene, a partner at Democratic digital strategy firm Rising Tide Interactive, speculates that the goal of this targeting method is to find people who \u201clike Donald Trump on Facebook, but they\u2019re not subscribed to his email list.\u201d On Facebook, she says, \u201cyou can upload your email list and then \u2018negative target\u2019 to suppress everyone that you have\u201d in your database\u2014to ensure the \u201cprospecting\u201d ad spending isn\u2019t wasted on die-hard supporters who already donate.\n\nA \u201cprospecting\u201d ad run by the Trump campaign starting October 9.\n\n\u201cThis looks like a direct mail campaign,\u201d said Dave Karpf, a professor and political scientist at George Washington University, who reviewed the campaign spending and purpose data for Quartz. Citing the long tradition of direct mail campaigns, largely by the right wing, he says the campaign appears to be \u201ctrying to identify people who will eventually give money or buy merchandise,\u201d often at great cost, he said.\n\nOnline advertising technology has advanced far beyond charging for just ad views or clicks. Instead, advertisers can pay based on various optimization goals, such as completed purchases (or donations) or videos watched for more than two seconds. Facebook uses its machine-learning techniques to maximize the advertiser\u2019s chosen goal, predicting which users are most likely to, say, make a donation, and then showing them the ad.\n\nThe Make America Great Again Committee\u2019s impeachment-related ads aimed at fundraising were optimized for conversions\u2013meaning that after seeing the ad, users did something off of Facebook, like making a purchase or a donation.\n\nBut according to the data reviewed by Quartz, most of the prospecting ads, most of which are aimed at supporters who are not yet known to the campaign, were optimized for click rate\u2013getting a user to click to a page with a name like \u201cThe Official Impeachment Poll\u201d or \u201cStand with Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cGetting them to click and learn more \u2026 I think that\u2019s what I would classify as prospecting. So long as they, within the Facebook universe, know that this person has clicked on it, you can then take that and retarget just that crowd,\u201d Karpf explains, showing more ads to the people who clicked. Facebook\u2019s \u201cpixel\u201d tracker allows website owners to target ads to Facebook users who\u2019ve visited their website, even without knowing that visitor\u2019s identity.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s someone that you can spend more money on to get them to take the next step. What you\u2019re trying to do is narrow down to the people that you have any chance\u201d of getting a donation, he said.\n\nShannon McGregor, a professor at the University of Utah who studies online political communication, says the ads serve an additional purpose to \u201chit home some of the talking points for on-the-fence Republicans,\u201d people who \u201care favorable [towards Trump] but maybe not in the hardcore base,\u201d even if they don\u2019t end up sharing their contact details.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign spent comparatively little money on its controversial ads that make false claims about Joe Biden\u2014which it designated \u201cawareness\u201d and \u201cpersuasion.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are looking at Trump\u2019s spending on Facebook and imagining that he\u2019s finding all these slices of the electorate that he\u2019s going to microtarget and convince to vote for him next time.\u201d\n\nBased on the spending patterns Quartz identified, Karpf says, \u201cThat\u2019s not what they\u2019re doing here.\u201d\n\nLet us know if you know more.\n\nAre you a digital marketing professional?
