The Minister has publicly said the government is prepared to make investments in the classroom, but at the bargaining table they appear determined to pursue their reckless cuts,\u201d adds Stuart.\n\n\u201cTo continue making progress, it has become necessary to conduct a strike vote to demonstrate our Association\u2019s solidarity and resolve. The government has not listened to our representatives at the bargaining table, so we will be asking our members to demonstrate they are united and prepared to do whatever is necessary to stand up for Ontario\u2019s world-class publicly funded education system,\u201d says Stuart.\n\nNegotiations can continue while the strike vote is being conducted. \u201cOur priority is to reach an agreement that recognizes Catholic teachers\u2019 vital contributions to Ontario\u2019s society and economy, protects against the government\u2019s cuts, and ensures quality learning and working conditions in our schools,\u201d says Stuart.\n\nOECTA will conclude its strike vote on November 13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- 30 -\n\nOECTA represents the 43,000 professionals who teach in publicly funded English Catholic schools in Ontario.\n\nMichelle Despault, Director of Communications Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association 416-925-2493 ext 509 m.despault@catholicteachers.ca", "description": "", "authors": ["Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
