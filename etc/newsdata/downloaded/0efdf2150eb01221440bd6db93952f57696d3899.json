REUTERS/Ints Kalnins\n\nTROMSOE, Norway (Reuters) - Scientists from 19 countries are preparing to embark on a year-long expedition to the Arctic, the longest project of its kind, to better understand global climate change.\n\nThe icebreaker Polarstern is preparing to set sail from Tromsoe in northern Norway, allowing hundreds of rotating researchers to spend the next year close to the north pole.\n\n\u201cWe want to go to the Arctic because it\u2019s the epicentre of climate change,\u201d Markus Rex, an atmospheric scientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany who leads the project, told Reuters.\n\nThe expedition, called Mosaic, is the first opportunity climate researchers have had to study the Arctic during the winter season as it has lacked necessary icebreaker equipment.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t understand the climate system in the Arctic well because we have never been there in winter,\u201d Rex said.\n\nThe scientists will for the first time be able to observe the key climate processes in the central Arctic year round, in the hope they will be able to generate more robust climate predictions in the future.\n\n\u201cSo far the climate models all have to guess somewhat about how these processes work in the central Arctic,\u201d Rex said.", "description": "Scientists from 19 countries are preparing to embark on a year-long expedition to the Arctic, the longest project of its kind, to better understand global climate change.", "authors": ["Ints Kalnins", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431979492&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J13I", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
