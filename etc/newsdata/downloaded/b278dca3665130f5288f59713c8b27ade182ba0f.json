The US government are now worried that it is leaking radioactive waste into the environment\n\nThe US government continues to insist that veterans of the cleanup operation faced low levels of radiation, that they wore protective clothing and that they carried radiation monitoring devices.\n\nHowever, photos from the time of the operation show men working bare-chested.\n\nThe US government has announced it will spend \u00a31.32 million to analyse the structure of a former nuclear test site in the South Pacific. Paul Griego, 62, pictured, said that Washington has not done enough to support individuals who worked in the cleanup of the Enewetak Atoll testing site\n\nAnd Mr Griego, a former radiochemist, said the dosimeter badges the men carried were not fit for purpose \u2013 being wrapped in thick plastic and designed for indoor use.\n\n'We are certain we have the very same radionuclides in our bodies that that would be found in the dome,' the 62-year-old told MailOnline.\n\n'We were bombarded with radiation while building the dome, we drank the contaminated water, inhaled the dust-filled air, absorbed contaminates though our skin, ate the fish we caught and more.'\n\nHe continued: 'We are not only denied the diagnostic resources, we are denied healthcare to cover our radiation and toxin-related illnesses.\n\n'The government's refusal to provide radiochemical resources is malicious and feeds into the status quo.\n\n'It places the burden of proof of an illness on the individual rather than the moral responsibility of our government.'\n\n30 megatons of weapons \u2013 equivalent to 2,000 Hiroshimas \u2013 were tested on the Enewetak Atoll between 1948 and 1958.\n\nThe Enewetak Atoll, on Runit Island, is found among the group of islands known as the Marshall Islands. The dome is the burial site of the remnants of 43 nuclear explosions. 30 megatons of weapons \u2013 equivalent to 2,000 Hiroshimas \u2013 were tested on the Enewetak Atoll between 1948 and 1958\n\nA billowing white mushroom cloud, mottled with orange, pushes through a layer of clouds during Operation Ivy, the first test of a hydrogen bomb, at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The government continues to insist that clean up operatives wore protective clothing and were equipped with radiation monitoring devices. George (pictured left), part of Operation Greenhouse, was fired from a tower May 8, 1951 at Enewetak\n\nDespite Washington's assurances that clean up operatives were properly protected, photographs of the time show men working without protective clothing at the nuclear site\n\nThe cleanup operation lasted three years, from 1977 to 1980, and involved thousands of people.\n\nThey collected contaminated surface soil and radioactive debris, which was then mixed with concrete and dumped it in a nuclear test crater, before it was entombed under a concrete dome.\n\nHowever, the crater wasn\u2019t lined and concerns have been raised by islanders and veterans alike that the dome is leaking.\n\nThe new funding will pay for an 18-month monitoring operation, including a radiochemical groundwater analysis and an engineering survey of the structural integrity of the dome.\n\nDoug Domenech, Assistant US Secretary of the Interior for Insular and International Affairs, said the government was being responsive to concerns.\n\nThe dome, on Runit Island in the Marshall Islands, hides the remains of 30 megatons of weapons \u2013 equivalent to 2,000 Hiroshimas \u2013 that were tested on the Enewetak Atoll between 1948 and 1958\n\nVeterans of the operation said: 'We were bombarded with radiation while building the dome, we drank the contaminated water, inhaled the dust-filled air, absorbed contaminates though our skin, ate the fish we caught and more'\n\nWorkers who entombed the radioactive waste at the site in the Pacific Ocean left a clear message before completing their work: a middle finger. They aimed to warn future visitors who may have happened upon the site\n\n'The US Departments of the Interior and Energy are partnering on this important analysis of Runit Dome so that we can be responsive to both Congress and concerns expressed by the Enewetak community in the Marshall Islands,' he said.\n\nA page on the website of the US government\u2019s Department of Veterans Affairs states: 'Veterans who participated in the cleanup at Enewetak Atoll encountered low levels of radiological contamination, and have a low risk of health problems.\n\n'Today, residents have very little or no intake of residual radionuclides, with annual radiation doses below US averages.'\n\nMr Griego, from Albuquerque, New Mexico, previously revealed how veterans of the cleanup operation buried a concrete-filled rubber glove in the dome, its middle finger raised in a 'salute.'", "description": "A concrete dome in the South Pacific, filled with the debris of 43 nuclear explosions, will be probed by experts amid mounting fears that it's leaking radioactive waste into the world's oceans.", "authors": ["Michael Havis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/10/19780646-0-image-a-29_1571218170490.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
