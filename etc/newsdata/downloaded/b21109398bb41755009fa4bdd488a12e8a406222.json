Several have indicated they are likely to back the deal.\n\nJacob-Rees Mogg \u2013 ex-leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) and now Leader of the House of Commons \u2013 called on his colleagues to support the deal in an article for BrexitCentral.\n\n\u201cNot only has the Prime Minister been successful in negotiating a new Brexit deal when so many believed he could not, but he has achieved changes which are not merely cosmetic but fundamental,\u201d he says.\n\nThe government may also secure some backing from more than 20 former Tory rebels, who were expelled from the party last month after defying the government over its Brexit strategy. They were overwhelmingly opposed to a no-deal exit from the EU.\n\nSome want a second referendum, but it\u2019s thought most may be more inclined to back Johnson now, albeit reluctantly.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat's in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal with the European Union?\n\nWhat possible Brexit scenarios could unfold in the next few days?\n\nBrexit Guide: Where are we now?\n\nLabour support?\n\nThe government is also likely to need the support of a number of opposition Labour MPs. The party leadership opposes Johnson\u2019s new deal and has instructed Labour MPs to vote against it.\n\nBut some have already backed the government in previous votes, and several represent Leave-voting constituencies. Significantly, the leadership has not threatened those considering supporting the deal with any punishment.\n\nLabour argues the new Brexit deal will damage the British economy, and threaten jobs and workers\u2019 rights. Shadow Chancellor (finance minister) John McDonnell tweeted that Johnson had \u201csold out virtually every sector of our economy\u201d.\n\nThe government will get no support from the likes of the Liberal Democrats, the Greens\u2019 one MP, the Welsh nationalists from Plaid Cymru, or the Scottish National Party. But the SNP leader, Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, wrote on Twitter that she was afraid that Labour \u201cwould be quite happy to see this deal go through\u201d.\n\nHistoric session\n\nThe weekend\u2019s parliamentary session will be the first time the House of Commons has met on a Saturday since Argentina invaded the Falklands Islands in 1982.\n\nIt promises to be one of the most dramatic in decades, with the vote perhaps setting the country\u2019s direction for years to come.\n\nIf the deal is passed at Westminster, the race will be on to pass the necessary legislation and ratify the accord ahead of the Halloween deadline. If it fails, more turmoil and uncertainty beckons in the days ahead.\n\nUK law in the shape of the Benn Act compels the prime minister to seek another Brexit extension from the EU \u2013 something Johnson has repeatedly said he will not do.\n\nMany people in the country \u2013 and in the EU \u2013 are struck by Brexit fatigue. Some MPs may be tempted to heed Johnson\u2019s calls to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d.\n\nBut his critics say his message peddles a dangerous myth. Opponents of the new deal will feel temporary uncertainty is worth suffering to avoid what they believe would be highly damaging long-term consequences.\n\nView the analysis of Euronews' UK correspondent Vincent McAviney in the video player above.", "description": "After its approval by EU leaders, the new Brexit deal faces a formidable hurdle at Westminster in a crucial vote on Saturday.", "authors": ["Alasdair Sandford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/21/14/1000x563_cmsv2_621742ed-a23f-5a71-8c7c-b1ae3071e990-4242114.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
