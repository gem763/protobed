Enjoy being reported to Virgin.'\n\nTweeting about her ordeal, Miss Van Meir - who is now based in the UK and works for legal firm McAllister Olivarius in Maidenhead, Berkshire - said: 'I was on a Virgin Atlantic flight, and I unexpectedly received these sexually harassing messages on my screen.\n\n'I was in 55C. The flight attendants were helpful and dealt with it swiftly. Have any other women had this happen to them?'\n\nOne passenger nine rows away on the flight told Miss Van Meir she was a 'tidy babe'\n\nMiss Van Meir replied that she works for a law firm that specializes in online sexual harassment\n\nShe added: 'Virgin Atlantic, you should probably take measures to prevent this from happening by flagging specific language and putting in place a reporting function on the chat to report abusive users.'\n\nVirgin's 'seat to seat' chat system allows passengers to communicate on board, often while playing games on the screen in front of them.\n\nIt can also be used to order drinks, a snack or an in-flight meal and staff then know where to deliver it.\n\nBut there are calls for the system to be changed to avoid it being hijacked by people sending unsolicited messages, and Virgin says it will now be reviewing the system.\n\nA spokesman told MailOnline: 'We were extremely concerned to hear of the incident reported on-board one of our flights and are investigating as a matter of urgency.\n\n'We want all of our customers to have the best possible experience when they fly with us, and have zero tolerance for any disruptive or inappropriate behaviour.\n\n'We're grateful to our cabin crew who supported our customer following this incident and would like to apologise for the distress caused. We are now reviewing our entertainment systems to ensure this does not happen again'.\n\nIt comes nearly a year after Ysolda Teague, 33, was getting on a British Airways flight when she saw someone on it had tried to AirDrop five pictures of his genitals.\n\nMs Teague, who spoke to HuffPost about her experience, was flying from London to Edinburgh with her partner Kate O'Sullivan, 37, and their six-year-old daughter.", "description": "Jessica Van Meir, from Atlanta, Georgia, shared images of the exchange on Twitter after the flight on Saturday where one passenger nine rows away told her she was a 'tidy babe'.", "authors": ["Martin Robinson", "Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/15/19397844-0-image-a-51_1570457099707.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
