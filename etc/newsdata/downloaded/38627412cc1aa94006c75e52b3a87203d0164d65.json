Cregg and the Illusions of The West Wing", "language": "en", "text": "That assumption, in its historical moment, was at once radical and fitting. The West Wing premiered just at the moment when American media were being shaken out of their earlier habits. The show was grappling with the ascendancy of cable news (CNN had been founded in 1980; Fox News and MSNBC had made their debuts in 1996). It was reckoning with the emerging demands of digital news. (Remember Lemon-Lyman.com?) The show cared deeply, in its way, about the consequences of the shifts that were taking place around it\u2014about the transformations to come in the new millennium and the new ways Americans would have to learn about themselves and their place in the world.\n\nAnd the show did much of that caring through C.J. Through her, in particular\u2014through her concern about being honest with the news reporters who double as her colleagues; through the stands she takes in arguing for the principles she believes in\u2014the show posits a world whose messy truths can be made sense of. That is part of its gauzy illusion. C.J. may be sarcastic; she may be, every once in a while, cynical; but she believes, at her core, in the power of shared facts, of shared information, of the common story. \u201cWe have an enormous pulpit,\u201d she reminds President Bartlet, when he wants to shelve a report attesting to the power of sex-education classes in schools. And then: \u201cMr. President? We can all be better teachers.\u201d During a military showdown between India and Pakistan, she reminds her assistant: \u201cIn the next few weeks it\u2019s going to be important for the president to reassure Americans and the world that he has a firm grip on the crisis and is working hard to defuse it.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s paternalism is there in those comments. But so is its earnestness. Here is C.J., living in the pre-post-truth world. Here she is, caring about facts and their consequences. In West Wing\u2013focused shows that would come after The West Wing itself\u2014among them House of Cards and Veep\u2014press secretaries are often dismissed either as duplicitous or simply as dupes. They are belittled in ways that call to mind the current presidential administration\u2019s attitude toward an independent press. C.J., though, was her show\u2019s moral center. And the news itself, similarly, isn\u2019t an enemy or a mockery in The West Wing; it is an environment that encompasses\u2014that implicates\u2014everyone. It is a schedule. It is a shared reality. \u201cLet\u2019s show the two minutes before and after what we see on CNN,\u201d The West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin described the show\u2019s premise recently. It\u2019s a small promise, in a show that made melodrama of democratic norms; it is also part of the fantasy the show was selling.\n\nThe West Wing played out in episodes, organizing its action around a few intersecting storylines; the news once did that, too. The \u201cnews story\u201d was its own kind of illusion. It was always too easy. It was never enough. But it pretended to be. \u201cThat\u2019s a full lid, everyone,\u201d C.J. Cregg said, and for a while that was supposed to mean something.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
