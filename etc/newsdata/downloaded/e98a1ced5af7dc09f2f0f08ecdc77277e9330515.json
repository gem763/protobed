They are among the most costly drugs available today, and represent a growing share of pharmaceuticals sold in Canada.\n\nBiologics expensive\n\nBy 2017, for example, seven of the top 10 medicines contributing to growth in patented drug sales in Canada were biologics, according to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board. Annual treatment costs that year ranged from $2,948 to $57,928.\n\nA protection period refers to the amount of time that data generated in clinical trials for a new medicine is off-limits to generic drug manufacturers.\n\nPharmaceutical companies are required to submit that data to regulatory bodies before a drug can be approved. After a certain duration, generic drug makers can access it to help produce cheaper alternatives.\n\nIn other words, the longer the data protection period, the longer a pharmaceutical company can exclusively profit from the sale of a brand-name drug without the threat of competition from generic options.\n\nDuring the CUSMA negotiations, Canada agreed to extend the data protection period for biologics to 10 years from eight.\n\nThe change would mean that, in some instances it would take at least two years longer for cheaper alternatives to brand-name drugs to become available.\n\nThere's an important distinction here: the prices of currently available drugs would not go up, rather Canadians prescribed future biologics would need to purchase the name-brand version for two years longer than if CUSMA was never negotiated.\n\nWon't be felt for years\n\nThe effects of the change wouldn't be felt until eight years after the agreement is ratified, because even without it, data on biologics is already protected for that long in Canada.\n\nHumira, a biologic used to treat forms of arthritis, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, is the third best-selling patented drug in Canada. (David J. Phillip/Associated Press)\n\nThe concession was pursued by representatives from the U.S., where clinical data on biologics is protected for 12 years.\n\nLengthening Canada's data protection period has long been a goal of the American pharmaceutical lobby, said Joel Lexchin, a professor emeritus at York University's School of Health Policy and Management and emergency room physician.\n\n\"Just follow the money. The drug companies that make biologics wanted the change,\" he said. \"And the drug industry in the U.S. is very powerful.\"\n\nJust how much a 10-year timeframe would cost the Canadian health-care system is difficult to estimate, Lexchin said.\n\nIn an April report, the Parliamentary Budget Office found that, by 2029, the data protection period extension for biologics could increase total annual costs for Canadian consumers and drug plans by at least $169-million. The added costs would continue to rise each year after, the PBO said.\n\nBut, as the PBO noted, any analysis of potential future costs is complicated by patents.\n\nPharmaceutical patents can last for 20 years. Therefore in instances in which a drug is covered by a 20-year patent, the data protection period will expire years before the patent does. That is to say, a longer protection period wouldn't be the most important factor in when cheaper alternatives could become available.\n\nMany variables in the mix\n\nThis had led some experts to project that the change could have little impact on health-care expenditures in the future, assuming many future biologics will have a 20-year patent.\n\nBut biologics are complex drugs, and the patent process is not always straightforward. There are a number of foreseeable scenarios in which the protection period is the limiting element, Lexchin said.\n\nThe number of variables in the mix means that projections are, at best, educated guesses.\n\nVerdict: It's complicated. If CUSMA is ratified, Canadians would likely have to pay more for some biologics for longer than they would have otherwise. But how much it will ultimately cost individual Canadians and the Canadian health-care system will depend largely on future pharmaceutical patents.\n\nSources: Ratification of new NAFTA in 2019 looking unlikely amid trade tensions, CBC News; Will USMCA affect Canada's drug prices?
