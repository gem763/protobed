Gillespie wants to shed some light on one of the darkest tales to ever rock North Carolina.\n\nIn 2015, self-proclaimed Satanist Pazuzu Algarad, born John Alexander Lawson in San Francisco, was found dead from an apparent suicide in his cell at the Central Prison in Raleigh, the North Carolina Department of Public Safety said at the time.\n\n\u2018HOMICIDE HUNTER\u2019 STAR LT. JOE KENDA REVEALS THE ONE CASE THAT HAUNTS HIM THE MOST\n\nThe 36-year-old is now the subject of a new docuseries on Viceland titled \u201cThe Devil You Know,\u201d which aims to explore how Algarad was able to achieve such power among a group of outsiders in the mostly religious town of Clemmons, N.C. \u2014 and how his madness drove him to murder.\n\n\u201cWhat drew me to the case really was not so much the sensational crimes, which they certainly were, but it was pretty clear there was a systematic failure that allows the crimes to happen,\u201d Gillespie told Fox News. \u201cWhat surprised me the most was how many times this could\u2019ve been prevented.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can really go back in time when the killer himself was a little boy having serious mental health issues and his mother didn\u2019t feel she had the finances to get him the treatment he needed,\u201d Gillespie continued. \"And you can go all the way back then, decades before the murders happened, and say, \u2018Jesus, could this have never been an issue?\u201d\n\nAlgarad and his girlfriend, Amber Burch, were arrested on October 2014 in connection with the deaths of two men who had been missing for five years.\n\nCiting arrest warrants, news reports said at the time Algarad was charged with killing Joshua Fredrick Wetzler in July 2009, and Burch with helping to bury the body. Burch, in turn, was also charged with killing Tommy Dean Welch later in 2009, and Algarad with helping her bury the body.\n\nGEORGIA MAN WHO CONFESSED TO MURDERING BUSINESS PARTNER WAS DRIVEN BY GREED FROM POULTRY BUSINESS: DOC\n\nAlgarad, who changed his name in 2002, found inspiration from \u201cPazuzu,\u201d the name used for the demon in the 1973 film \u201cThe Exorcist.\u201d Coined \u201cThe Charles Manson of Clemmons,\u201d he covered his face with tattoos, sharpened his teeth to spikes, drank the blood of birds, performed ritual sacrifices of rabbits and orchestrated orgies in his home.\n\nHe previously told psychiatrists he had been practicing the \u201cSumerian\u201d religion that involved the monthly \u201cSatanic ritual\u201d of a small animal. His mother Cynthia James, who participated in the documentary, had previously told psychiatrists she was worried Algarad might try to kill himself if he were not allowed to perform his \u201cdark moon\u201d sacrifice. Algarad also had so-called \u201cspiritual wives\u201d he welcomed into his circle.\n\nThe Daily Beast previously reported Algarad allowed his friends to do \u201cwhatever they pleased to his abode,\u201d including relieving themselves in the corner of a room, and then \u201cleaving the mess to be eaten by one of his many dogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf people feel pushed out of their community or they\u2019re not getting help, they\u2019ll go somewhere where they\u2019re accepted,\u201d Gillespie explained. \u201c... Everyone\u2019s going to have their own reason for why they showed up there, but I think a lot of it has to do with needing a family, needing acceptance and needing care. Even though it was ugly and nasty, he provided an accepting environment. Some would say an enabling environment.\u201d\n\n\u2018DEADLY WOMEN\u2019 HOST CANDICE DELONG SAYS FEW ARE \u2018BORN EVIL,\u2019 BELIEVES THERE ARE MORE UNDISCOVERED FEMALE KILLERS\n\nA video taken by a county housing inspector showed debris, animal carcasses and moldy ceilings at the home where the skeletal remains of Wetzler and Welch were found buried in the backyard in 2014.\n\nAn autopsy report showed that Wetzler was shot three times in the head and at least four times around the torso, the Winston-Salem Journal reported. Welch was shot once in the back of the head.\n\nAccording to the documentary, Algarad had previously bragged about committing the murders but no one took him seriously. It is believed some of the townspeople tolerated Algarad out of fear. The Daily Beast pointed out the police had received reports about bodies buried in Algarad\u2019s backyard, but nothing turned up after an initial search in the \u201choarder-style insanity of the place\u201d and undeniable stench. The outlet shared it took a second, more thorough examination for human remains to be discovered.\n\nWhile circumstances of how Algarad met his victims remains unclear, Gillespie said it is possible the men found their way into his home and were accepted by the so-called cult leader.\n\nWOMAN WHO KILLED \u2018DIRTY JOHN\u2019 SAYS SHE\u2019S STILL STRUGGLING WITH PTSD: \u2018I HAD TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENED TO ME\u2019\n\n\u201cThe man who organized this is dead, but my strong impression was that he was looking to find weak and vulnerable people he can easily dominate in order to cement the fear and reverence he had instilled in the people in his circle and his community, by being extreme as possible,\" she said. \"The short answer is he was a coward and needed to look tough. And these were easy people to exploit and harm.\u201d\n\nGillespie said that many of the facts surrounding the case were quickly sensationalized in initial reports. In the docuseries, she takes a careful look at Algarad\u2019s deteriorating mental health and the lack of care he received before the murders.\n\n\u201cWhen his mother spoke to me, she said it was mostly about finances,\u201d said Gillespie. \u201cIt had a lot to do with money, had a lot to do with access. And at a certain point, if you\u2019re a tiny little woman, you can\u2019t make your adult son who killed people in your house do what you want. I think without a doubt, finances played into this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey diagnosed him as being agoraphobic, schizophrenic, psychotic,\u201d James recalled in the documentary, as reported by Oxygen.com. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started getting help for him. But to continue with the psychiatrists and so forth, it takes a lot of money.\u201d\n\nRELATIVES OF SHARON TATE, JAY SEBRING SPEAK OUT ON HORRIFYING MANSON MURDERS 50 YEARS LATER\n\nDuring his psychiatric evaluation, Algarad said he bathed no more than once a year and did not brush his teeth in years. He was also not taking any medications at the time. Algarad then stated he left school in the ninth grade because \u201cthat\u2019s when the phobia around people started.\u201d He admitted to regularly drinking since age 13 and consumed a 12-pack of beer daily because it \u201cjust calms me down\u201d or he would otherwise get \u201cthe shakes.\u201d Algarad claimed when he was outside his house \u201cmy anxiety gets so high I faint.\u201d In addition, Algarad said he suffered schizophrenia and manic depression.\n\nOxygen.com reported practicing Satanists have distanced themselves from Algarad\u2019s actions and the house of horrors has since been demolished.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have facts to back up the idea that there are more victims,\u201d said Gillespie. \u201cI certainly heard a lot of stories that I wasn\u2019t able to corroborate to an extent where I was comfortable putting that information out there. I do know everyone who was directly involved with some exceptions that you\u2019ll learn about in the film, has served their time, is serving their time, or has immunity. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any further risk from this group of people to the community\u2026 I don\u2019t have any personal evidence there were more crimes.\u201d\n\nGillespie said she hopes audiences will look pass the shocking headlines surrounding Algarad\u2019s case and instead understand how the killings could have been prevented.\n\nMANSON FAMILY MEMBERS SPEAK OUT 50 YEARS LATER IN SHOCKING DOC, RECALL MEETING CULT LEADER: \u2018I FELT ACCEPTED\u2019\n\n\u201cMy loftiest goal is that it will change the way some viewers look at crime and they\u2019re not just looking at gun powder residue and blood splatter, but they\u2019re working out, \u2018What is the cultural context?\u2019 \u2018What could have been my role in it?\u2019 \u2018Do I need to reach out to that kid?\u2019 \u2018Do I need to demand better of my police department?\u2019\u201d said Gillespie. \u201cI hope it\u2019s going to make people start asking questions.\u201d\n\nThe finale of \"The Devil You Know\" airs Sept. 24 at 10 p.m. on Viceland.
