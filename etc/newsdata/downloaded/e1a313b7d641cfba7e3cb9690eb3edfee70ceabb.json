The figure represents a 22.9% premium to the LSE\u2019s closing price on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nUnder the terms of the offer, LSE shareholders would receive 2,045 pence in cash and 2.495 newly issued HKEX shares.\n\n\n\nHong Kong Exchange and Clearing Ltd (HK: )\u2019s share prices fell 3.5% to HK$237.20 by 12:30 AM ET (04:30 GMT) on Thursday following the news.\n\n\n\nCiting David Blennerhassett, an independent analyst writing on the SmartKarma research platform, Reuters said Hong Kong\u2019s status as part of China could make it difficult to win approval for the deal from British politicians and regulators.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt will be politically tough now and in the near-term to get this through various regulatory channels,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe Financial Times echoed with Blennerhassett\u2019s comments, adding that the bid is poised to be rejected amid doubts about political risk and deal structure.\n\nProtests against a highly controversial extradition bill began in June and have crippled Hong Kong\u2019s stock market and its economy. The proposed bill allows criminal suspects to be transferred to mainland China for trials. While the protests started as peaceful marches on the streets, the unrest became increasingly violent escalated into anti-government movements that saw protestors occupying the airport and disrupting its services, tear gas fired by police forces and hundreds of citizens arrested.", "description": "Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Makes Takeover Bid for London Stock Exchange", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB250CR_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
