If he continues down the path he\u2019s on, we'll keep counting it in that category of obstruction.\n\n\"Just fall into this trap if you want to.\"\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin Jamin (Jamie) Ben RaskinHouse Democrats introduce new legislation to combat foreign election interference Graham says he'll invite Giuliani to testify about Ukraine Democrats set to grill ambassador embroiled in Ukraine controversy MORE (D-Md.) offered a similar assessment, arguing that Trump's refusal to comply with congressional requests for documents and witness testimony will simply boost the Democrats' case that he's a lawless president, worthy of impeachment.\n\n\"They've been obstructing us for months in our investigation. This clearly becomes another impeachable offense,\" Raskin, a member of the Oversight Committee, said Wednesday by phone.\n\n\"Essentially, they're writing their own impeachment articles with all of their obstructionism,\" he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe comments arrive as the Democrats' impeachment effort has gone from a slow slog to a rolling boil in just a matter of weeks, following allegations from a government whistleblower that Trump leveraged U.S. military aid to Ukraine in return for political favors from the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump has vehemently denied any quid pro quo. But the news prompted Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiPelosi hits back at Trump over letter: 'Only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy' Murkowski warns against rushing to conclusions on Trump impeachment Turkey says it will cross into Syria 'shortly,' issues warning to Kurdish fighters MORE (D-Calif.), who had long resisted the impeachment effort, to endorse an inquiry into whether Trump, in pushing Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenPelosi hits back at Trump over letter: 'Only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy' Clinton jokes she could 'obviously' beat Trump in 2020 'rematch' Gowdy in talks to join Trump's impeachment defense team MORE, had enlisted foreign help to boost his reelection chances.\n\nBehind Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffOvernight Defense: Trump defends Turkey amid fierce criticism | Senators demand briefing on Syria decision | Turkey confirms strikes on Syrian border | White House says it won't cooperate on impeachment inquiry Trump fires back on impeachment Democrats subpoena Sondland for testimony, documents MORE (D-Calif.), Democrats have moved swiftly to gather evidence, issuing subpoenas and deposing witnesses with insights into the whistleblower charge.\n\nThe effort has been only partially successful.\n\nRepublicans in the White House and on Capitol Hill have made clear they deem the impeachment inquiry to be illegitimate, since Pelosi has refused to stage a floor vote to launch the process officially. Such votes preceded the last two impeachment proceedings, targeting Presidents Nixon and Clinton, and GOP leaders contend the absence of such a vote denies Republicans certain legal tools to mount a defense of Trump, including the power of the minority party to issue subpoenas.\n\nAfter allowing testimony from two witnesses last week \u2014 Kurt Volker Kurt VolkerGOP, Trump look to smother impeachment inquiry Trump directed Perry, State Dept. officials to talk to Giuliani on Ukraine: report Overnight Defense: Trump defends Turkey amid fierce criticism | Senators demand briefing on Syria decision | Turkey confirms strikes on Syrian border | White House says it won't cooperate on impeachment inquiry MORE, former special envoy to Ukraine, and Michael Atkinson, inspector general of the intelligence community \u2014 the White House blocked Tuesday's scheduled deposition of a third State Department official, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. And hours later, White House counsel Pat Cipollone delivered a letter to Pelosi warning that the administration had no intention of responding to \"legally unsupported demands.\"\n\n\"As you know, you have designated and implemented your inquiry in a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process,\" Cipollone wrote.\n\nThere's no constitutional requirement that the House vote to launch an impeachment inquiry. And Democrats wasted no time vowing to press on with their investigation, with or without cooperation from Trump.\n\n\"We expect this kind of behavior from him,\" Rep. Adriano Espaillat Adriano de Jesus Espaillat CabralLawmakers mourn death of 'Julia' star Diahann Carroll Democrats rally behind incumbents as Lipinski takes liberal fire House Democrats blur lines on support for impeachment MORE (D-N.Y.), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, told The Hill on Wednesday. \"It will help us, and bolster our position that, in fact, he may be engaged in another obstruction of justice [offense]. And another article of impeachment could derive from that.\"\n\nTrump said Wednesday said he might be willing to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, but only if House Democrats hold a formal vote to outline rules for the investigation and if those rules \"are fair.\"\n\n\u201cWe would if they give us our rights. It depends,\" Trump said when asked during an event in the Roosevelt Room of the White House.\n\nAsked again to clarify his position, Trump reiterated that he would collaborate with Democrats \"if the rules are fair.\"\n\nThe Democrats' strategy is multi-tiered.\n\nIn the near-term, they intend to press for more documents and witness testimony related to the Ukraine affair \u2014 and issue subpoenas in cases when those witnesses fail to comply. Sondland was on the receiving end of such a subpoena Tuesday.\n\nOne potential witness Democrats are eyeing is William Taylor, the U.S. charg\u00e9 d'affaires of Ukraine, who had expressed concerns last month that Trump had crossed a line by dangling military aid to pressure Zelensky for political favors.\n\n\"He's an obvious witness,\" Rep. Peter Welch Peter Francis WelchDemocrats claim new momentum from intelligence watchdog testimony Intelligence watchdog huddles with members as impeachment push grows Senators call for more automakers to join emissions deal with California MORE (D-Vt.), a member of the Intelligence and Oversight committees, said Wednesday by phone.\n\nThe next test will come Friday, when Marie Yovanovich, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled in May, is scheduled to be deposed by the three committees \u2014 Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs \u2014 leading the investigation.\n\nAn official working on the impeachment inquiry said the expectation is that Yovanovich will appear. But a number of Democrats are voicing their doubts.\n\n\"Given the way that Trump's been behaving,\" said Welch, \"I expect he'd stop that as well.\"\n\nLooking further ahead, Democrats are planning to put new pressure on Trump's Republican allies in Congress by staging a series of votes in the coming weeks on legislation designed to protect U.S. elections from foreign interference. In September, after months of resistance, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMurkowski warns against rushing to conclusions on Trump impeachment Overnight Defense: Trump defends Turkey amid fierce criticism | Senators demand briefing on Syria decision | Turkey confirms strikes on Syrian border | White House says it won't cooperate on impeachment inquiry McConnell blasts House Democrats over handling of impeachment inquiry MORE (R-Ky.) reversed course and agreed to advance legislation providing $250 million to boost election security.\n\nDemocrats are readying similar bills this month.\n\n\"They're going to have to explain why they believe it\u2019s OK for the president to invite a foreign country to interfere in our elections and undermine the very bedrock of our democracy,\" the senior Democratic aide said. \"That's part of the objective when we get back.\"\n\nHouse lawmakers are slated to return to Washington next week.\n\nSome Democrats on key committees are also eyeing contempt of Congress votes against witnesses who fail to comply with subpoenas \u2014 or the administration officials who have blocked their testimony. Raskin mentioned Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoProspects dim for breakthrough in Trump's trade war with China Budowsky: Biden and Warren at POTUS Rubicon Top Democrats warn against withdrawing from treaty that allows observation flights over Russia MORE, who has put the brakes on such testimony, as one potential target.\n\n\"We have the power in Congress to hold these people in contempt and to insist upon their compliance,\" said Raskin, a former constitutional law professor.\n\nLess clear is whether Schiff and the Intelligence Committee will pursue their ignored subpoenas in the courts.

But I think we will proceed,\" said Welch. \"And she'll be the principal one making that decision.\"\n\nCristina Marcos contributed.", "description": "Democrats are charging ahead with their impeachment inquiry despite a White House vow not to cooperate in the investigation, all but daring President Trump to stonewall the probe and add fuel to allegations that obstruction itself is an impeachabl", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/schiffadam_pelosinancy_100219gn7_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
