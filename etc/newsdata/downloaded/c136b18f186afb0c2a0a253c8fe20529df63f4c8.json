Other photos and a video obtained by Global News Canada of Trudeau in blackface have also come to light.\n\nTrudeau on Wednesday apologized for the offensive costume, and said he \"should have known better.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Trudeau offered up another apology during a press conference and said donning blackface \"is always unacceptable.\"\n\n\"Darkening your face, regardless of the context or the circumstances, is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface,\" he told reporters. \"I should have understood that then and I never should have done it.\"\n\nRead more: 13 photos that threatened to derail political careers \u2014 from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to presidential candidate Gary Hart\n\nCanadian Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau makes a statement in regards to a photo coming to light of himself from 2001, wearing \"brownface,\" during a scrum on his campaign plane in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2019.

The fact is, I didn't understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every day.\"\n\nHe added that the incident was a \"terrible mistake\" and hoped he would be forgiven by people who considered him an ally.\n\n\"This has been personally a moment where I've had to reflect on the fact that wanting to do good and wanting to do better simply isn't good enough,\" he said.\n\n\"And you need to take responsibility for mistakes that hurt people who thought I was an ally \u2014 who hopefully, many of them still consider me an ally even though this was a terrible mistake.\"\n\nCanadian politicians have criticized Trudeau over the photos, and have called the act \"insulting.\" The incident comes at a time when Canada is in the middle of an election campaign and Trudeau is fighting for a second term.", "description": "Photos and videos surfaced this week showing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in offensive makeup on three occasions in the 1990s and 2000s.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8371f92e22af1586068046-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
