You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFrom next month, McDonald\u2019s customers can swap the plastic toys given in children\u2019s Happy Meals for a fruit bag, and from next year, for a book.\n\nAround 1.2 billion McDonald's Happy Meals are sold across the globe every year.\n\nBurger King admitted the company was \u201cspurred on\u201d to remove plastic toys from its children\u2019s meals following the launch of an online petition by a couple of schoolgirls.\n\nJust under a year ago, sisters Ella and Caitlin McEwan launched a petition on Change.org to get McDonald\u2019s and Burger King to \u201cthink of the environment\u201d and stop giving children with plastic toys.\n\n\u201cWe like to go to eat at Burger King and McDonald\u2019s, but children only play with the plastic toys they give us for a few minutes before they get thrown away and harm animals and pollute the sea,\u201d the nine-year-old and the seven-year-old wrote in the petition.\n\nThe campaign has since garnered more than half a million signatures, with a target of reaching a million.\n\nAlasdair Murdoch, chief executive of Burger King UK, said the removal of plastic children\u2019s toys from its restaurants is a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf it makes other competitors move their practices forward, that can only be a good thing,\u201d Mr Murdoch said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In December 2017 Britain joined the other 193 UN countries and signed up to a resolution to help eliminate marine litter and microplastics in the sea. It is estimated that about eight million metric tons of plastic find their way into the world's oceans every year. Once in the Ocean plastic can take hundreds of years to degrade, all the while breaking down into smaller and smaller 'microplastics,' which can be consumed by marine animals, and find their way into the human food chain.
