Fans are mad, U.S. politicians are angry, and there\u2019s evidence that even Blizzard\u2019s employees are upset.\n\nUnited States Senators Marco Rubio (R-Florida) and Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) both tweeted their condemnation of Activision Blizzard\u2019s actions on Tuesday. \u201cBlizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d Senator Wyden tweeted. \u201cNo American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecognize what\u2019s happening here,\u201d Senator Rubio said on Twitter. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t live in #China must either self censor or face dismissal & suspensions. China using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally. Implications of this will be felt long after everyone in U.S. politics today is gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlizzard\u2019s decision to censor a player who voiced support for the Hong Kong protests is part of a profoundly disturbing trend by American entities like the NBA bending over backward to appease the Chinese government,\u201d Senator Wyden told VICE in an email. \u201cChina\u2019s repression of peaceful dissent is disgusting when it happens in China, but it is incredibly disturbing that American companies would willingly participate in the Chinese government\u2019s propaganda campaign.\"\n\nAt the entrance to Blizzard\u2019s Irvine, California campus, there\u2019s a 12-foot tall statue of an orc. Various bronze plaques bearing inspirational inscriptions are set into the concrete around the statue. The plaques herald lofty ideals such as \u201cGameplay first,\u201d \u201cThink Globally,\u201d and \u201cEvery Voice Matters.\u201d Kevin Hovdestad, an esports announcer and former Activision Blizzard employee, shared a photo of \u201cThink Globally\u201d and \u201cEvery Voice Matters\u201d being covered up on Twitter.\n\n\u201cNot everyone at Blizzard agrees with what happened,\u201d said Hovdestad.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that if Activision Blizzard hadn\u2019t taken action against Blitzchung, China would have taken action against Activision Blizzard. Beijing banned South Park after it mocked the country, and stopped streaming pre-season NBA games after the general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted a message of support for Hong Kong protesters.\n\nTencent, a Chinese video game developer, owns a 4.9 percent stake in the company. China is a huge and important market where Activision Blizzard makes millions. The World of Warcraft film, for example, fizzled in America but grossed $225 million in China, nearly double its budget.\n\n\u201cBlizzard results benefited from the continued success of our business in China and the extension of our partnership with [Chinese telecom company] NetEase.,\u201d Coddy Johnson, Activision Blizzard\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, said in a 2018 earning\u2019s call. \u201cBuilding on our 11-year joint venture, the expanded agreement runs until January 2023 and reflects the substantial value and opportunity for Blizzard's content in China.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, this issue has caused a sharp reaction in Blizzard\u2019s various communities.\n\nThe /r/hearthstone subreddit is awash in angry players promising to give up on Activision Blizzard, and both /r/overwatch and /r/wow have threads dedicated to Chung\u2019s suspension. As of this writing, the /r/blizzard subreddit is viewable by invitation only. Reddit confirmed with VICE that /r/blizzard\u2019s mod community was responsible for the change, but declined to comment further. Blizzard\u2019s own community forums are full of angry fans. The top thread on its Hearthstone board stands in solidarity with Blitzchung. It currently has 606 replies and 6.7k views.\n\n\u201cI play [Hearthstone] everyday,\u201d redditor Hinz97 said in a post. \u201cI climbed to Legend several times. I spent more than $10k. As a [Hong Konger], I quit [ Hearthstone] without consideration.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuitting [Hearthstone] over this nonsense. This is about more than just Hong Kong,\u201d redditor u/bye_bitches said in a post on /r/hearthstone. \u201cIf you're still playing, then you're sending a message: \u2018I'm ok with this, multinationals should help China get away with violations of human rights.\u2019 Hong Kong people are involved this time, just hope the next time it won't be you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing since beta. Good riddance,\u201d redditor UltimaterializerX said. \u201cBlizzard CLEARLY only cares about the Chinese market. The censorship of art was bad enough. The censorship of human life is indefensible. Finding videos of what\u2019s going on in Hong Kong is easy and I suggest everyone do so. It\u2019s Tiananmen Square all over again.\u201d\n\nActivision Blizzard is less than a month from Blizzcon, an annual convention it puts on to showcase new games and celebrate its fans. Some fans are talking about boycotting the convention, others are planning to stage a protest. \u201cWith Blizzcon coming up, would be cool if people flew some pro-[Hong Kong] flags at the opening ceremony,\u201d redditor pastesonly said in a thread about the controversy on /r/wow.\n\nSome of most dedicated Activision Blizzard fans feel betrayed. \u201cI've played Blizzard games since I was seven,\u201d said redditor Poobs87, who has one of the most upvoted comments on /r/hearthstone, in a direct message to me on Reddit today. \u201cThey've been a big part of my life growing up, I respected them and loved the experiences they gave to me and my generation growing up...the Hong Kong protestors are up against an awful evil, and Blizzard is obviously just one of many companies being forced to comply with China's censorship.\u201d\n\nActivision Blizzard did not respond to request for comment.\n\nFollow Matthew on Twitter .
