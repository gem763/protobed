The central bank has tried to achieve this by advancing interest rate liberalisation so that interest rates better reflect market conditions. The new loan prime rate introduced last month is expected to benchmark at least half of new loans by year-end.\n\nThe PBOC can influence the loan prime rate through the rate it charges on its medium-term lending facility (MLF), which it uses to lend Chinese banks extra liquidity at low cost. It surprised the market earlier this week when it kept the rate on new MLF loans unchanged at 3.3 per cent, despite widespread market expectations that it could lower the rate modestly in response to the rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.\n\nChaoping Zhu, global market strategist of JPMorgan Asset Management, attributed the PBOC\u2019s reluctance to cut the MLF rate to the earlier reduction in the amount of money that banks are required to hold in reserve, which injected 800 billion yuan (US$113 billion) of capital into the banking system on Monday.\n\n\u201cFinancing costs might have declined to the [central bank\u2019s] target\u201d because of the reserve requirement cut, Zhu explained.\n\nThe decline in the one-year loan prime rate was generally in line with market expectations.\n\nConsidering the need to offset the downward pressure on the economy, [the central bank] will find it irresistible to adjust the MLF rate at that key time\n\nZhang Jun\n\nZhang Jun, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, said the regulators focusing on banks\u2019 cost of funds as a way to reduce their lending rates was a different approach than focusing on rates directly but that it should lead to the same results. The reduction of banks\u2019 fundraising costs through the reserve requirement cut would enable banks to lower their lending rates that are used to calculate the loan prime rate.\n\nThe next opportunity for the central bank to cut banks\u2019 costs will be November 5, when it will could cut the interest rate on a new MLF loans to replace a batch that is maturing.\n\n\u201cConsidering the need to offset the downward pressure on the economy, [the central bank] will find it irresistible to adjust the MLF rate at that key time,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nThe latest economic data released on Monday showed that Chinese economic growth continued to slow in August. Industrial production growth slowed to a new 17-year low of 4.4 per cent last month, while retail sales growth slowed to 7.5 per cent and January-August fixed asset investment growth also dropped to 5.5 per cent, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nMore from South China Morning Post:\n\nThis article China cuts short-term interest rates slightly in latest bid to help companies hit by US trade war first appeared on South China Morning Post\n\nFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2019.", "description": "China trimmed its market reference rate for new short-term bank loans on Friday, taking another step towards helping companies hit hardest by the trade war with the United States and the overall domestic economic slowdown.The September loan prime rate, the average taken from 18 selected commercial banks", "authors": ["Frank Tang"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/P.UKkRoSV8fKc2BeRvfaNg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_621/6a91613b9c13c5c4cba631a556ec86b6", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
