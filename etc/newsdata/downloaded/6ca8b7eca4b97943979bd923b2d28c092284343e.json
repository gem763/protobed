In his scathing 2016 dossier, released in full last Friday, Sir Richard identified 43 key blunders by detectives investigating Beech's allegations.\n\nCritically, he said Mr Riddle was 'misled' by police when they applied in 2015 to search the homes of retired armed forces chief Lord Bramall, the widow of former home secretary Lord Brittan and ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor.\n\nA former Cabinet minister has written to Priti Patel demanding a full criminal investigation into the conduct of 'Nick' scandal detectives\n\nBut amid claims of a 'whitewash', the Independent Office for Police Conduct has cleared five officers of misconduct.\n\nTwo senior officers were cleared without even being interviewed. Sir Richard condemned the probe as 'flawed' and expressed alarm at the watchdog's 'lack of knowledge of criminal procedure'.\n\nTwo days after the watchdog explained its controversial findings, which prompted widespread condemnation, Mr Davis demanded a comprehensive probe into the conduct of Midland officers.\n\nHe told Miss Patel: 'The Henriques Report published last week makes troubling reading, particularly its conclusion that six search warrants for properties associated with Lord Bramall, Lord Brittan and Harvey Proctor were unlawfully obtained.\n\nThe Tory former Brexit Secretary's intervention piled pressure on Miss Patel to take decisive action to ensure justice for the victims of the lies of fantasist Nick, aka Carl Beech\n\n'We now know officers involved in Operation Midland failed in their legal duty to disclose crucial information that undermined their case when applying for the warrants. Carl Beech's evidence was inconsistent throughout questioning and any reasonable police officer ought to have had serious doubts as to his credibility. These doubts should have been recorded and disclosed to the judge when the warrant applications were made.'\n\nHe concluded: 'I would urge in the strongest possible terms that the official investigation into his debacle establishes whether police officers involved in Operation Midland were guilty of either criminal action or gross misconduct and the relevant authorities take the appropriate action to ensure justice for the victims.'\n\nMr Proctor, falsely accused of being a child killer by Beech, also wrote to Miss Patel yesterday calling for her to act\n\nMr Proctor, falsely accused of being a child killer by Beech, also wrote to Miss Patel yesterday calling for her to act.\n\nA Home Office spokesman said: 'The Home Secretary has asked Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to conduct an inspection of the Metropolitan Police Service to ensure that lessons have been learned from Sir Richard Henriques' report.\n\n'We now need to give the inspectorate the time and space to carry out that work and we won't be commenting further while it is ongoing.'\n\nThe IOPC declined to comment on Mr Riddle's assertion that he was misled by police over the search warrants.", "description": "David Davis (pictured) urged the Home Secretary in the 'strongest possible terms' to ensure an inquiry establishes whether officers involved in Operation Midland 'were guilty'.", "authors": ["Stephen Wright Associate News Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/22/19511716-0-image-a-39_1570655612784.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
