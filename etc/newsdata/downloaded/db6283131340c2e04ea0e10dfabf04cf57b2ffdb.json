I\u2019ve had to walk rather than sit in traffic that\u2019s built up because of road closures.\n\nAs a parent of young \u00adchildren, of course I sympathise with what they are trying to do.\n\nAnd at home in our own little way we are trying to do our bit to help. We walk or \u00adsometimes take the bus to school instead of driving in a nice warm car which would get me and a tantrum- throwing four-year-old there in under 10 mins.\n\nI\u2019m a recycling zealot and we\u2019ve pretty much cut out red meat. So many of us are trying and agree things need to change.\n\nBut my sympathy starts to run out when I hear that some of these eco warriors aren\u2019t all camping out in London out of the goodness of their hearts. Oh no. Up to 100 activists are being paid up to \u00a3400 a week \u2013 almost \u00a3100 more than the national living weekly wage \u2013 to sit around singing Kumbaya while getting in the way of thousands of others who are just trying to earn a living.\n\nSo as well as being provided with shelter in the form of tents, blankets, food and \u201cprotest tools\u201d such as handcuffs, their bank balances are getting fatter as well.\n\nSpeaking of bank accounts, Extinction Rebellion\u2019s is swelling by \u00a340,000 a day. Since it launched a year ago, the group has raised more than \u00a32.4million. Nice work if you can get it.\n\nA demonstrator has even admitted \u201cflying\u201d to the UK to join his fellow \u00adprotestors \u2013 did someone say carbon \u00adfootprint? You couldn\u2019t make it up.\n\nThere is obviously a lot of goodwill there, and with time and education things can and will change, but bullying us into submission and turning the heart of the capital into a mini Glastonbury festival, isn\u2019t the way to do it.\n\nAnd as for people making money out of it, so much for us all being in this together.", "description": "Columnist Eva Simpson on why she's losing sympathy with the climate-change protesters who have brought parts of London to a standstill for the past three days", "authors": ["Eva Simpson", "Image", "Cornwall Live"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20546385.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Members-of-Extinction-Rebellion.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
