Photo: Apple TV\n\nAfter months of speculation, Apple\u2019s new video service finally has a launch date and a price. Apple TV+ will begin streaming its first shows on November 1 and will carry a price tag of $4.99 per month, company CEO Tim Cook announced Tuesday. What\u2019s more, in a bid to build a huge subscriber base as quickly as possible, starting today Apple will offer a year of Apple TV+ free to anyone who buys a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod touch, or Mac computer. With Apple\u2019s family sharing service, that subscription can be accessed by up to five other people. Apple\u2019s pricing makes its offering the most affordable of any of the current or planned major streaming services.\n\nOf course, Apple is also offering a much more streamlined offering than its rivals: While it is currently working on a couple dozen original series for its first year, Apple TV+ won\u2019t include a library of existing TV shows and movies the way Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and the forthcoming Disney and WarnerMedia products will. Because of that, recent media speculation suggesting Apple might charge as much as $10 per month never made much sense, even for a company known for charging a premium price for its hardware. But at $5 per month and a free year of service for the tens of millions of consumers who will be buying Apple products this year, Apple TV+ suddenly looks like one of the best bargains in streaming.\n\nCook leaned into that notion at Tuesday\u2019s event: \u201cAll of these incredible shows for the price of a single movie rental,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is crazy.\u201d As for what consumers can expect at launch, Apple says the first crop of shows to begin streaming November 1 will include the dramas The Morning Show, See, Dickinson, and For All Mankind, as well as kid-centered shows Snoopy in Space, Helpsters, and a reboot of Ghostwriter. As for how shows will roll out, Apple says, \u201cAt launch, most Apple TV+ series will premiere with three episodes, with one new episode to roll out each week, while full seasons of some series will be available all at once.\u201d\n\nBetween the aggressive launch price and free year offer, Apple TV+ should be able to scale up its subscriber base fairly quickly. But that doesn\u2019t guarantee long-term success. Unless Apple continues the promotion every time folks buy a new Apple product, a year from now, Apple TV+ could face the loss of millions of subscribers who sampled the product but decided their $5 per month might be better spent on Disney+, Comcast\u2019s upcoming streaming service, any number of other streamers, or simply their own pocket. The key will be how much audiences embrace Apple\u2019s first class of shows.", "description": "After months of speculation, Apple\u2019s new video service finally has a launch date and a price.
