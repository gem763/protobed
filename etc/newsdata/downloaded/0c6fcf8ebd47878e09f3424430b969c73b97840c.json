Dann Gaymer and Nan Su, who have just completed a 20-stop tour of Europe, like their live shows to be visual spectacles. With lots of improvisation and audience participation, no two shows are ever the same.\n\nSpeaking to Young Post after returning home to Beijing, multi-instrumentalist Gaymer and singer Su discuss their approach to live performances, as well as their new music.\n\n\u201cSometimes, you can get so set in your ways of how something should sound,\u201d says British-born Gaymer, 32, who was a solo artist before he met Su, 31, in 2014.\n\nNow is the time for Hong Kong's rappers to shine\n\nHe explains how endless touring first prompted the band to mix up their live shows.\n\n\u201cWe were just playing the same songs every night, over and over, and they weren\u2019t really changing. It felt like karaoke.\u201d\n\nThe duo decided to make use of Su\u2019s artistic skills. A professional illustrator, Su began creating drawings in real-time during live shows, and projecting them onto the stage backdrop for the crowd to see. This idea eventually gave way to a host of creative ideas, costumes, and improvisations which have made Guiguisuisui\u2019s live shows truly unforgettable.\n\nPart of their art comes from a background in illustration.

Then, we tried different stages, and giving the audience choices, so there\u2019s that interaction.\u201d\n\nSu sums it up best: \u201cWe just don\u2019t know how the set\u2019s going to end. We know what we want to try and achieve, but sometimes it\u2019s more like experimenting for us.\u201d\n\nThe visuals have progressed the most, moving from a projection of Su drawing using Photoshop on a laptop to a multiplayer mode that allows several audience members to collaborate at the same time.\n\nHong Kong Indie rock group Nowhere Boys won't let commercial success change them\n\n\u201cThis works nicely, because just as much as the music can change the mood of the audience, the visuals can change it too, or even the direction of the music,\u201d says Gaymer.\n\nThis love of experimentation and improvisation has spilled over into the duo\u2019s approach to writing and recording as well. They released their EP Charon earlier this year, then followed it up with the Charon Remixes in August after testing out the songs.\n\n\u201cIt felt like this really natural extension where we recorded the EP, took it on the road, and the people we performed in front of helped to reinterpret it more,\u201d says Gaymer. \u201cThe tracks can really come to life when other people add ideas to them, which is a really nice, organic process. And for us, it\u2019s a nice little record of all the interesting people that we\u2019ve met along the way.\u201d\n\nEd Sheeran's hometown celebrates the singer-songwriter with an exhibition of his pre-fame life: guitars, photos and a puppet from 'Sing'\n\n\u201cA lot of the lyrics on the EP are in Chinese, and a lot of the people we meet mainly speak English,\u201d adds Su. \u201c[But] there are themes like yin and yang, dark and light \u2013 so even if people can\u2019t understand the lyrics, we\u2019ve been able to communicate the themes through the music or performance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting that you don\u2019t just have to use words to connect with people.\u201d\n\nEdited by Charlotte Ames-Ettridge", "description": "When these Beijing-based alt-rock musicians perform live, no one \u2013 not even them \u2013 knows what will happen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/0bdee80c-eb09-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4imagehires135018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
