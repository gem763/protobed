It came in the wake of a whistleblower complaint from an intelligence official alleging that Trump had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump initially acknowledged discussing his political rival in a phone call with the Ukrainian leader, and the White House on Wednesday released a summary of the call that confirmed it. Trump has denied wrongdoing in connection to the call.\n\nWhen asked: \"Impeachment is the first step in the process of removing a president from office. Do you think the House of Representatives should impeach President Trump?\"\n\nRespondents were considerably more in favor than has been seen in other polling recently. It's unclear, however, whether this is a result of sampling, phrasing, or a genuine shift in opinion.\n\nOverall, 45% of respondents supported impeachment, with 29% of respondents saying \"strongly.\"\n\nOverall, 30% of respondents opposed impeachment, with 20% of respondents saying \"strongly.\"\n\nTwenty-five percent did not know or neither supported nor opposed impeachment.\n\nThe poll was conducted Wednesday and Thursday, after Pelosi's announcement but as the news was still developing. Forty-one percent of respondents identified as a Democratic likely voter, compared with 31% who identified as a Republican likely voter. The rest said they were unlikely to vote in a 2020 caucus or primary or declined to say.\n\nMajorities think launching an inquiry is the right thing to do, and most aren't familiar with the Ukraine situation\n\nThe numbers become clearer when it comes to merely launching a formal impeachment inquiry, as Pelosi announced. An impeachment inquiry is an investigation that the House will use to decide whether to impeach the president.\n\nWe asked: \"Do you believe launching a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump for soliciting foreign interference in a US election is the right thing to do?\"\n\n33% said \"definitely yes.\"\n\n20% said \"probably yes.\"\n\n15% said \"probably not.\"\n\n18% said \"definitely not.\"\n\nThat's a significant majority in favor of launching the investigation. Overall, Americans are generally unfamiliar with the incident in question.\n\nWe also asked: \"How familiar would you say you are with the situation stemming from President Trump's conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky related to Democratic candidate Joe Biden?\"\n\nJust 33% of respondents said they were \"extremely\" or \"very\" familiar.\n\nIf Trump is found to have done what the whistleblower said he did, large majorities of Americans back serious consequences\n\nRespondents were asked, \"What should the consequences be for a public official who encourages a foreign power to intervene in an upcoming domestic election in their favor?\" before they were asked about more in-depth detail of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe results were squarely unambiguous:\n\nMerely 6% said \"I do not think that warrants any action.\"\n\n11% said \"I think the matter should be looked into but don't see any immediate issue.\"\n\n19% said \"I think that merits investigation and possibly censure, penalties or discipline.\"\n\n49% said \"I think that merits investigation and possibly removal from office.\"\n\nThat majority in favor of serious consequences for that hypothetical action held among those who said their political beliefs were conservative: Twenty-six percent said it'd merit investigation and possible discipline, and 25% said it'd merit investigation and possible removal.\n\nThere's a chance this blows back on Democrats electorally\n\nDemocrats have cast their lot in with impeachment, but do so at their peril.\n\nWhile majorities in the poll said launching an impeachment inquiry was the right thing to do, fewer saw electoral upside for Democrats in doing so.\n\nWe asked: \"Do you believe launching a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump will overall work out in Democrats' favor electorally?\"\n\n10% said \"definitely would.\"\n\n22% said \"probably would.\"\n\n24% said \"probably would not.\"\n\n19% said \"definitely would not.\"\n\nThis paints an interesting series of battle lines for the 753 respondents who knew their opinion about both the rectitude and electoral peril of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nHere's how they viewed the exercise:\n\n38% thought an inquiry was the right thing to do and would help Democrats electorally.\n\n19% thought an inquiry was the right thing to do but would hurt Democrats electorally.\n\n7% thought an inquiry is the wrong thing to do but would help Democrats electorally.\n\n37% thought an inquiry was the wrong thing to do and would hurt Democrats electorally.\n\nRead more:\n\nA formal impeachment inquiry has been launched: Here's everything we know about the whistleblower complaint and Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president\n\n30 Republican Senators might vote to impeach Trump if the ballot were secret, GOP source says\n\nTrump aides quickly regretted publishing the Ukraine call that has intensified calls for his impeachment, report says\n\nSurveyMonkey Audience polls from a national sample balanced by census data of age and gender.
