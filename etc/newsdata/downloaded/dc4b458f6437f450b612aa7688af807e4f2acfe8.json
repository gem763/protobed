Reminder: There are 123 days until the Iowa caucuses and 397 days until the 2020 election.\n\nOn Thursday, Need to Impeach, a group funded mainly by billionaire activist and Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, will launch a $3.1 million ad blitz targeting four of the most vulnerable Republican senators up for reelection in 2020: Susan Collins of Maine, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Martha McSally of Arizona.\n\nThe script reads in part: \u201cWith all that our country stands for, how can we have a president who thinks the law doesn\u2019t apply to him? Who would bargain away the security of our nation and our elections for his own political gain? We are patriots who have always protected democracy. Will our senator?\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s only the beginning of the headaches in store for the small group of endangered GOP senators whose votes on impeachment may eventually decide their electoral fates \u2014 and control of the Senate itself.\n\nThe 2018 Senate map was famously tilted against Democrats \u2014 so much so that Republicans wound up gaining two seats even though they lost the nationwide popular vote for all Senate races by 20 percentage points.\n\nThe 2020 map isn\u2019t a slam dunk for Democrats, but it\u2019s friendlier, according to the expert analysts at the Cook Political Report. Of the 12 Democratic seats in play, only one (Doug Jones in Alabama) is considered a tossup, and only three (Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico) are seen as remotely competitive (that is, not \u201csolid\u201d for Democrats). By comparison, there are 23 Republican-held seats on the board, and three of them are tossups: McSally, Gardner and Collins. One more (Thom Tillis of North Carolina) merely \u201cleans\u201d Republican, and an additional seven (including Ernst in Iowa and both Senate seats in Georgia) are considered competitive.\n\nTo regain their Senate majority, Democrats need to flip three seats (with a Democratic vice president, who casts the deciding vote in a tied Senate) or four seats (if Republicans keep the White House).\n\nThe question now is whether the impeachment push can help them get there. The theory, at least, is that President Trump will be so toxic in key battleground states by the time the Senate holds an impeachment trial, Republican senators from those states will be forced to make an impossible decision: break with the GOP, vote to remove him from office and lose the Republican base (and reelection) \u2014 or take one for the team, vote to keep him in office and lose swing voters (and reelection).\n\nPresident Trump (Photo: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) More\n\nNo one knows how impeachment will play out. But at-risk Republican senators are squirming already, and with good reason.\n\nIn Colorado \u2014 where Trump\u2019s disapproval rating is 15 points higher than his approval rating and where recent polling shows Democratic Senate candidate John Hickenlooper, a former governor, clobbering Gardner by 10 to 13 percentage points \u2014 the incumbent is doing everything he can to dodge the issue. \u201cLet\u2019s find out what\u2019s happening,\u201d Gardner said last week. \u201cLet\u2019s get to the bottom of this. I\u2019m not going to get in front of the facts that I simply don\u2019t have right now.\u201d\n\nIn Maine \u2014 where Trump is underwater by 13 points and where Collins\u2019s approval rating fell 16 points in the first half of 2019 \u2014 the incumbent is staying mum. \u201cI don\u2019t know what evidence they\u2019re using,\u201d Collins said initially. Then, after the release of the Ukrainian call summary and the whistleblower report, she started to backtrack. \u201cI would remind everyone, if articles of impeachment are passed by the House, that my role would be to act as a juror,\u201d Collins said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to be prejudging the evidence and I\u2019m not going to be commenting on the House\u2019s proceedings.\u201d", "description": "For a small group of endangered GOP senators, their votes on impeachment may eventually decide their electoral fates \u2014 and control of the Senate itself.", "authors": ["Andrew Romano", "West Coast Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qzBuEExJ.0znXyOyb3Ioug--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/84844640-e5ea-11e9-bc33-e63226400fe3", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
