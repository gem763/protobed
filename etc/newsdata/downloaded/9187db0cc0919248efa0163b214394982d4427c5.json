Two months ago enraged protestors near Potchefstroom in the North West hijacked an excavator and dug large chunks off a tarred road, creating craters on the road, cutting off motorists.\n\nThe video clip, still available online, displays the kind of barbarism and anarchy which has no place in a modern democracy.\n\nIt is the same kind of idiocy displayed by the Fees Must Fall protestors which left a trail of destruction which cost taxpayers over R500 million in 2016.\n\n\n\nI will probably be attacked by the woke ones for calling black people barbarians, but it is what it is. South Africa needs people who will call things what they are.\n\nIf you need more convincing that this society is broken and is collapsing, look no further than how you drive.\n\nYou skip red robots, drink and drive, drive on the yellow line, drive facing oncoming traffic, overtake on a solid line, are impatient and are ready to show the middle finger at the slightest of provocations.\n\nThe number of people who perish on the roads is exceedingly high and South African roads are generally up to par with roads in developed countries.\n\nThe explanation is that we are a dysfunctional, broken and collapsing society.\n\nLast month South Africans watched in horror as foreigners attacked the police in the Johannesburg city centre.\n\nIt was not the first time. About a year ago there was a video clip in which foreigners in and around Berea and Yeoville had a confrontation with the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department over illegal parking.\n\nTruth be told, the fact that foreigners don\u2019t do violence in their own countries but do it here means that they learned from us.\n\nWe condemn them because we want monopoly on violence in our own country.\n\nDisregard for symbols and figures of authority is a sure sign of a broken and a collapsing society.\n\nIt is only a matter of time before this society collapses completely and becomes like Mexico and many Latin American countries where drug gangs execute their rivals in broad daylight, in front of the police.\n\nFollowing the run-in between the police and foreigners in the city centre, there has been a low-intensity conflict between the authorities and immigrants.\n\nAffected areas include the Johannesburg city centre, Jeppe, Malvern and surrounding suburbs.\n\nThis past weekend violence flared again, and foreign-owned shops were looted and hundreds of cars in dealerships around these suburbs were torched.\n\nLawlessness in the city centre has resulted in the influx of contraband goods, general decay of buildings and public spaces due to littering and people relieving themselves on pavements.\n\nLastly, a collapsing society is typified by a general decline in values and morals, a deterioration of public institutions and decadent lifestyles by politicians and businesspeople.\n\nWhen a society collapses, there is also a marked increase in clamour for resources by everyone, but mainly politicians and businesspeople in the private sector.\n\nIn South Africa this is clearly demonstrated by the revelations coming out of the Zondo Commission.\n\nAll South Africans are hanging on a cliff and it is up to us to haul our country back from the brink or let it tumble over the edge.", "description": "The pillars that hold South Africa as a society are being shaken violently and it is time for all citizens, civil society and the private sector to rise up and avert a total collapse which is increasingly looking inevitable with each passing day.", "authors": ["Sipho Masondo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/88/ea73c2b97b6646f2bba851c5f8f7741e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
