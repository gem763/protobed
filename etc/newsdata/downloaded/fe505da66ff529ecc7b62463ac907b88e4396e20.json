Facts are facts.\n\nIt follows, then, that this proverbial \u201ceveryone\u201d would be glad to know that there\u2019s a very good spooky kid plot line in Emergence, the new ABC thriller that premieres Tuesday night.\n\nA plane mysteriously crashes on a Long Island beach and found hiding behind a sand dune next to the wreckage is\u2014you guessed it\u2014our central S.K. (spooky kid). She doesn\u2019t have a mark on her. Nor does she have any memory of who she is or how she got there. The local police chief, Jo, played by series lead Allison Tolman, takes the girl in, concerned.\n\nThose concerns grow during a phenomenal car crash set piece. After the girl is abducted by shady men posing as government investigators, she appears to have flipped the car telepathically, and emerges from the wreckage, once again, sans a single injury. By the time she starts to make metal dance with her mind, forget it.\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t love a spooky kid?\u201d Tolman says, peer-recommending my unflappable theory when we meet in a New York hotel room on the evening of a fan screening of her new show.\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Daily Beast\u2019s Obsessed Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture.

Her boyfriend is in the room working on his laptop, while her young co-star, Robert Bailey Jr., hangs out while waiting for the event to start. By the time our conversation is over, Scrubs star Donald Faison, who plays Jo\u2019s ex-husband, stops by with a stylist, as do Tolman\u2019s parents, in town to screen the premiere for the first time. Guacamole and tuna tartare are offered to all.\n\nTolman knows the comparison that will be at the top of everyone\u2019s minds when they learn the plot of Emergence. \u201cStranger Things is the obvious comparison, just because it\u2019s the spooky little girl show of the moment,\u201d she says. But when she thinks of Stranger Things, she thinks of \u201980s nostalgia. When she thinks of Emergence, she thinks of a grounded family drama shrouded in the mystery of a conspiracy thriller.\n\nThe New York Times likened it to E.T., which, more nostalgia aside, is a pretty accurate description.\n\nEmergence marks Tolman\u2019s first leading role in a drama series since her Golden Globe- and Emmy-nominated performance as Molly Solverson in Fargo in 2014, a role she was plucked out of obscurity in Chicago to play.\n\nBoth characters, Fargo\u2019s Molly and Emergence\u2019s Jo, are police officers. But she likes that, unlike Molly, Jo doesn\u2019t have anything to prove. She also likes that Jo isn\u2019t the kind of woman we\u2019re conditioned to expect when we\u2019re watching a female police chief on TV.\n\n\u201cI find that a lot of those shows, the heroines drink like a man and, like, her dad never loved her,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s all this dark past, as if that\u2019s what's needed to justify a woman in this position in a dangerous field. I think you could just be a normal woman and choose to work in a dangerous field.\u201d\n\nTolman and her partner, who has a job he can do remotely, put their cat in a car and drove across the country to New Jersey, where the series shoots. (In a bit of kismet, Faison and Tolman\u2019s husband were already golf buddies before the Scrubs alum was cast on the show.)\n\nWhile so often an actor speaks in interviews about a lack of control, going where the wind takes them in their careers, Tolman is frank about how discerning she\u2019s been in what projects she\u2019s been a part of since Fargo ended.\n\n\u201cBecause I broke so late\u2014I was in my thirties when Fargo happened\u2014it took a lot of pressure off of me,\u201d she says. She figured, why go backwards after a project like that and take a bad role? \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that happens? I go back to working in an office? I was just doing that a year ago. So no harm, no foul.\u201d\n\nShe jokes that, because of the circumstances of Fargo\u2014actors like Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman were the marquee names, but her character, loosely based on Frances McDormand\u2019s role in the movie, was the actual star\u2014she tricked Hollywood into thinking she could lead a series. She\u2019s nothing if not self-aware: of her previous industry experience, of her age, of her skills, of her looks and how they\u2019re viewed in Hollywood. More: of her ambitions.\n\n\u201cI was like, if I\u2019m not careful, I\u2019m going to be relegated to the type of roles I would normally have been relegated to, like the funny aunt and the best friend,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I somehow circumvented that with Fargo and I\u2019ve been really lucky to not slip back into that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been five years since the FX series premiered, and she\u2019s still asked about the show and her \u201cstory,\u201d as she puts it, ad nauseum in interviews. (Hey, we\u2019re self-aware, too; that includes this interview.) She\u2019s worked steadily since, on shows like Downward Dog, Good Girls, I\u2019m Sorry, and Castle Rock, and in movies like Krampus, The Sisters Brothers, and The House.\n\nBut there\u2019s something about the particular circumstances of her out-of-nowhere debut, and the fact that, bucking every Hollywood stereotype and superficial tendency, she\u2019s the lead of one of the splashiest broadcast drama series premiering this fall.\n\nEveryone loves it when \u201ca star is born.\u201d With Tolman, we want to make sure that star is still doing OK.\n\nWhen Tolman landed her role on Fargo, she was temping as a receptionist at a consulting firm in Chicago for $11 an hour. She and her boyfriend had moved there from their home in Dallas about five years prior. The day she put herself on tape at her agent\u2019s office for Molly, she was between a work shift and going to a job interview. That anything would come from it seemed implausible.\n\nBut she kept surviving casting rounds. Fargo executive producer Warren Littlefield gave up his ticket to New York and hotel room for the casting sessions so that Tolman could remain in the mix. Tolman saw Six Feet Under star Lauren Ambrose and Downton Abbey\u2019s Joanne Froggatt at the auditions.\n\nWhen all was said and done, Tolman won the role. Soon she was on set in a frozen tundra outside Calgary (stepping in for Minnesota), making small talk with Billy Bob Thornton. The surreality of it all was almost constant. During one conversation about past relationships, Thornton mentioned an ex-wife of his who now has a lot of kids and, at that time, a partner who was also in the industry\u2014as if everyone wasn\u2019t losing their minds that he was referring to Angelina Jolie.\n\nThen there\u2019s a Top Five proud-parent story ever: Tolman\u2019s mother used to write her own press releases announcing the premiere of her daughter\u2019s TV debut, complete with her own home phone number on it.\n\nWhen her mother arrives in the hotel room near the end of our interview, she laughs about it. \u201cI didn\u2019t know! I thought it was helpful!\u201d She\u2019ll still occasionally reach out to her daughter to let her know that someone from their local newspaper would like to talk to her. \u201cI\u2019m like, great, I\u2019ll pass it on to my publicist, who I pay,\u201d Tolman laughs.\n\nThere was awards attention and media profiles and, generally, just a warmth radiating towards her, this 32-year-old actress thrust into stardom on such a prestigious show.\n\n\u201cI was older when I broke and Molly was such a warm and endearing character, I think it just makes a good story,\u201d Tolman says. \u201cOne that you want to keep tabs on. That\u2019s the thing that I hear more and more often from people that I interact with online. It\u2019s just like, \u2018I'm just so happy whenever I see you on my television.\u2019 People that I barely know say, \u2018I know this sounds weird, I\u2019m just so proud of you.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe laughs and shrugs one shoulder kind of sheepishly. She clicked as Molly in Fargo because of her palpable intellect, but also because of a kind of shrewd skepticism. There\u2019s a niceness about her, but also a lingering suspicion that there\u2019s a ferocity not to be underestimated. Consider it a strong sense of self.\n\nAfter Fargo ended, she did the thing young actors are told never to do. She said no to things. Lots of things. As she mentioned before, the crazy aunts and kooky friends and bored housewives. She doesn\u2019t remember what most of those projects were, but she does remember why she said no.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t love scripts that immediately define a character by her weight,\u201d she says. \u201cI tend to put those scripts down and not pick them up again. It just is icky, and I find it kind of distasteful. I feel like we managed to make all of Fargo without ever talking about the fact that I\u2019m a size 12 or 14, and I feel like why should we go backwards now?\u201d\n\nIn June 2014, near the end of Fargo\u2019s run, Tolman made headlines when she defended herself on Twitter against online trolls and critics who were fat-shaming her.\n\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, internet\u2014I\u2019m not fat, I\u2019ve just been wearing this GIANT EFFING COAT FOR 8 WEEKS ON YOUR TELEVISION,\u201d she tweeted, along with a photo of the parka she wore on the show. \u201cI\u2019m not sad, y\u2019all,\u201d she continued. My points are: A- Christ on a cracker, stop defining women by size. B- I\u2019m AVERAGE- women on TV are TINY. #realtalk.\u201d\n\nHer decision to respond to critics generated support while also igniting debate, once again, about the ridiculous standards of beauty Hollywood perpetuates, not to mention the toxic internet culture that fans those flames.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a surprise, and it\u2019s not a surprise now,\u201d Tolman says when I ask her about the ordeal. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise in that it\u2019s surprising that people continue to talk about other people that way. But I wasn\u2019t surprised that was something that people picked out about me. Because people pick on women\u2019s bodies all the time no matter what.\u201d\n\nBesides, she says, she\u2019s not naive. \u201cI certainly was aware just from my life and my work up until that point that most actresses on television are smaller than I am. And that just the very nature of the way TV works would make me look much bigger than I actually am in real life.\u201d\n\nIn the days leading up to the premiere of Emergence and the blitz of press that goes along with it\u2014not the mention the insistence on being vulnerable that entails\u2014she\u2019s been thinking about these things a lot.\n\n\u201cSort of trying to remind myself that I am not the image that is put forth on screen,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that people can think and say whatever they want to, but I know who I am and I\u2019m much more than my physical being. And I\u2019m certainly much more than my physical being as interpreted on a two-dimensional television screen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never going to be enough,\u201d she continues. \u201cI could diet every day and it wouldn\u2019t matter. People are always going to have something to say. So what\u2019s the point of worrying about it?\u201d\n\nDriving home the point, our next topic of conversation is all the stunts she\u2019s now doing as the lead of Emergence, a show that promises a set piece as explosive as the premiere\u2019s car crash in every episode. Allison Tolman is basically now an action hero.\n\nAs her partner, co-stars, and parents mill about the hotel room and it\u2019s nearly time for her to leave for the screening, I ask her what she has been most proud of in these last few years. She brings the conversation back to Emergence, shrewdly, but what she says makes great sense, especially when you get to know her.\n\nWhen she booked the role, she made a studious effort to ask her friends in the business and, especially, the crew members she used to work with on Fargo what makes a good No. 1 on the call sheet. What does a person need to do to lead a happy, functioning set?\n\nIt\u2019s a responsibility she doesn\u2019t take lightly. We continue talking about it in fits and starts, as it takes an inordinate amount of time to say goodbye to everyone who has gathered in the room. The work was done, and everyone was happy. Whatever it was that she was told goes into being a network TV leading lady, she\u2019s learned it in spades.", "description": "Five years after her star-is-born moment in \u201cFargo,\u201d the \u201cEmergence\u201d star tells us how she fought typecasting, body-shaming, and sexism to become a leading lady on her own terms.", "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569286307/190923-Fallon-Allison-Tolman-tease_h38hby", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
