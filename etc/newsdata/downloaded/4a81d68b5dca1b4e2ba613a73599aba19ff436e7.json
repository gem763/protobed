While the president arguably could say more, he has criticized China\u2019s conduct toward Hong Kong \u2014 most recently, in front of the entire world at the United Nations.\n\nButtigieg told the audience at the debate: \u201cIn a place like China, the people of Hong Kong rise up for democracy and don\u2019t get a peep of support from the president.\u201d\n\nBut that is simply untrue.\n\nThe president told the UN last month:\n\nAs we endeavor to stabilize our relationship, we\u2019re also carefully monitoring the situation in Hong Kong. The world fully expects that the Chinese government will honor its binding treaty, made with the British and registered with the United Nations, in which China commits to protect Hong Kong\u2019s freedom, legal system, and democratic ways of life. How China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future. We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader.\n\nOne could argue that the Trump administration could say and do more about Hong Kong.\n\nThe same is true of CNN and the New York Times \u2014 the co-sponsors of the debate \u2014 who failed to ask a single answer about China or Hong Kong. No other Democratic candidates mentioned Hong Kong at the debate, either.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
