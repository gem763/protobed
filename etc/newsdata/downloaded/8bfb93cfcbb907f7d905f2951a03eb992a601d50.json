As a result, I tried to beat my hair into submission to do what I thought it should do. I straightened it, I dyed it, I fried it.\u2019\n\nFeeling noticeably more confident about her hair, Tracee has released her new Pattern Beauty haircare line, which specifically caters to people with 3B to 4C hair types.\n\nTracee\u2019s launched her own haircare line Pattern Beauty (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThe TV star felt pressure to straighten her curly hair (Picture: WireImage)\n\nLet\u2019s face it, Tracee can rock any hairstyle (Picture: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhich group you fall into, is based on the look, feel and texture of your hair.\n\nBut Tracee was surprisingly met with scepticism with some apparently questioning whether she had the \u2018credibility\u2019 to start her own haircare line.\n\n\u2018[The journey] has been fraught with many disappointments, me running up against many of the things that were exactly what made me feel bad about myself,\u2019 Tracee explained.\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t have the credibility to do this, you need to partner with a professional\u201d, and me attempting to explain that I, like many women of colour and people with curly hair, have become our best experts because the industry has not supported us.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
