Such a comment is in reference to Pete\u2019s year long relationship with Rhona \u2014 which came to an end earlier this year as the couple realised that, in spite of being in love with one another, they wanted different things.\n\nOf course, the interesting thing about Cain\u2019s comment is that Rhona is portrayed by Jeff\u2019s real-life wife, Zoe \u2014 which is something that viewers wasted little time point out on social media.\n\nCain mentionin Rhona in Emmerdale. \u2014 damo18 (@damo184) October 22, 2019\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t even keep hold of the vet\u201d Cain mate that\u2019s your other wife \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude09 #Emmerdale \u2014 Emmerdale News (@News4Emmerdale) October 21, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it was nothing more than a fleeting mention \u2014 as the drama continued for Cain as he sought vengeance on Pete in subsequent scenes \u2014 it certainly didn\u2019t go unnoticed with viewers.\n\nInterestingly, this isn\u2019t the first time that Emmerdale has made reference to Jeff and Zoe\u2019s real-life relationship either, as \u2014 a couple of years back \u2014 Rhona revealed that Cain would be her fantasy one-night-stand.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Cain made an attempt to chat Rhona up when she first arrived in the village all the way back in 2001.\n\nThe drama continues in the Dales tonight, as Cain seeks revenge on Nate after Peter informed him that the new farmhand was having an affair with his wife.\n\nEmmerdale continues Tuesday 22nd October 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Viewers were quick to notice Cain's comments.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cain-dingle-and-rhona-goskirk-in-emmerdale_1571750847.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
