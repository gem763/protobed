Trump and California v. Trump. The American Civil Liberties Union filed the two lawsuits, which challenge the legal rationale Trump used in February to declare a national emergency at the southern border and reallocate funds for a wall there.\n\n\u201cIAVA is speaking out on behalf of service members and their families,\u201d CEO Jeremy Butler said in a statement. \u201cRegardless whether you support or oppose the border wall, it should not come at the expense of our service members and their families.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe group, which has about 425,000 members, said it filed its brief in opposition to the $3.6 billion in moved military construction funding, \u201cwhich was set aside to help military service members and their families. Instead, the funds are now being diverted to the controversial border wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cIAVA takes no position on the constitutionality of President Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration or the wisdom of building a border wall. Nevertheless, IAVA strongly opposes requiring military service members and their families to pay the cost of funding the wall,\u201d a statement accompanying the brief said.\n\nThe move is one of several efforts meant to block Trump\u2019s use of the construction funds for his wall.\n\nIn the Senate last week, Democratic-sponsored legislation tried and failed to reverse Trump\u2019s use of military base project dollars by attempting to override his veto of a resolution that would have ended the emergency declaration.\n\nThe House tried in March, also unsuccessfully, to override the president\u2019s initial veto.\n\nIAVA, meanwhile, argues that the diversion of funds \u201cexacerbates a longstanding military construction budget crunch, with profound consequences for military service members and families.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon on Sept. 4 released a list of military construction projects that would see some of their funding go toward the wall, including schools and hurricane-destroyed bases.\n\nIAVA contends that many of those deferred plans will make service members stationed in the United States and abroad less safe.\n\nAmong the gutted tasks is a $16 million undertaking needed to revamp a rail holding area at an ammunition plant in Indiana, where service members \u201ccurrently work in violation of Army safety standards while handling and storing explosives.\u201d\n\nAnother is a $37 million project for a specialized Air Force facility in Maryland meant for unloading hazardous cargo and a range for bomb-defusing training.\n\nThe IAVA brief also claims that service members and their families will be denied basic living necessities and emergency services because of the funding shift.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the Air Force needs $41 million to replace a failing central heat power plant boiler at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, where winter temperatures reach 65 degrees below zero,\u201d the brief says.\n\nThe list also includes nine canceled school projects in the United States and overseas.\n\nThe existing schools \"all suffer from varied states of disrepair and overcrowding,\" such as at the middle school at Joint Base Andrews, Md., \u201cwhich has a waitlist of 115 children, suffers from mold and pest infestations as well as sewage backups and heating and ventilation failures.\u201d\n\nBechtel Elementary School in Germany is described as \u201cin failing condition\u201d and \u201cdoes not meet U.S. fire suppression standards and needs extensive infrastructure work ranging from electrical branch circuits to lighting to plumbing and piping.\u201d\n\nThe brief presses the courts to cancel the president\u2019s diversion of funding and reinstate the money back to the intended projects.\n\n\u201cEven if Congress decides to fund these projects again in later years, that would lead to the deferral of other high-priority military construction even further down the line,\u201d IAVA argues.\n\n\u201cService members are used to discomfort. ... But they should never be asked to work in unnecessarily unsafe or harmful conditions, or to wait even longer for basic facilities that are already long overdue. That is the result of the funding diversions, and this Court should bear that result in mind as it considers the issues before it,\u201d IAVA adds.", "description": "A prominent veterans association on Monday evening backed a pair of lawsuits against President Trump\u2019s move to divert millions of dollars in military funding to his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/borderwall_061819getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
