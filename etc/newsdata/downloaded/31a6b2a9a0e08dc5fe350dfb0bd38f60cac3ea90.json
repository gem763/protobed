Meanwhile Jeb Bush has collected nearly $125,000 so far from 2012 donors to Obama.\n\nThe chart above gives the clearest view of where party donors of old are placing their newest bets. While Obama donors overwhelmingly favor Hillary Clinton (no surprise), Newt Gingrich donors are giving the most to Ted Cruz this time around. Rick Perry bowed out of the 2016 race in September. During the 2016 cycle, his 2012 supporters gave more to fellow Texan Ted Cruz than they did to Perry himself.\n\nThe money above represents that given to the campaign committees of candidates for president. It excludes money giving to political action committees and so-called super PACs, which are legally separate from the campaigns, but increasingly count for a vast proportion of campaign spending. Campaigns are only required to disclose donations of $200 or more, so small donors to 2012 candidates are not represented in these figures.\n\nWith open fields in both parties, donations to candidates in 2011 far outpaces the equivalent period from four years ago. Donors have shelled out $166,000,000 to presidential campaign committees so far this cycle, compared to $106,000,000 during the equivalent period in the previous cycle.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://timeinclabs.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/donors_fullscreen.png"}
