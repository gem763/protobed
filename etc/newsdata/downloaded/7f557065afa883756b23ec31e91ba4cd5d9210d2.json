After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\nColeen set up a plot to expose Rebekah (Picture: Jean Catuffe/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColeen continued: \u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nColeen captioned the statement: \u2018This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it\u2026\u2026\u2019\n\nThe mum-of-four, who is married to Wayne Rooney, has yet to post the alleged screenshots.\n\nRebekah fired back in her own statement, writing: \u2018As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this. I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me over the years can vouch for.\n\n\u2018If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reality star continued: \u2018I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen and I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019\n\nShe concluded her post with a broken heart emoji.\n\nRebekah followed Coleen\u2019s personal Instagram (Picture: PA Wire)\n\nDanielle Lloyd supported Coleen, leaving a string of rat emojis under the statement and writing: \u2018on a serious note though who does that it\u2019s terrible.\u2019\n\nEngland footballer Toni Duggan also commented: \u2018Wow!! This is disgusting!!!! Hope your ok [sic].\u2019\n\nRebekah, 37, is currently pregnant with her fifth child, her second with footballer Jamie Vardy.\n\nThe WAG achieved further fame in 2017 when she appeared on I\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out Of Here!\n\nShe and Coleen became pals as their husband played alongside each other for England.\n\nJamie and Wayne were England teammates (Picture: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images)\n\nThe latest story Coleen alleges that Rebekah gave to the press was that her Cheshire home had flooded during Storm Lorenzo.\n\nThe report cited a source as saying that Coleen had pushed back the completion date on the renovation to the family home due to the damage.\n\nThe source said: \u2018The house is Wayne and Coleen\u2019s dream, so to see it being damaged has been horrible for them.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColeen also cited a story from Heat magazine, claiming that the star wanted to return to television.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Rebekah\u2019s rep for further comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
