If you find it a challenge to resist alcohol, it might mean that your alcohol dependence is more advanced than you think.\n\nYour alcohol consumption - friendly fun or a problematic independence? ~\n\nEver heard of OcSober? This is a challenge not to consume any alcohol for the entire month of October \u2013 October + sober, get it?\n\nMany people enjoy their drink of choice mainly in a social setting \u2013 that glass of wine with friends after work or a couple of drinks while gathered around a braai. OcSober is therefore more of a healthy, recreational \u201ccleanse\u201d than anything else. For most of us, it's also not that much of a challenge to give up booze for thirty days.\n\nBut if OcSober fills you with dread, and it\u2019s something you absolutely cannot imagine pulling off, you might need to rethink your relationship with alcohol.\n\nHow much is too much?\n\nStudies in the past have suggested that alcohol in moderation may have positive effects on heart health. Especially red wine has been touted for its health benefits because of the resveratrol it contains, i.e. the antioxidant that gives purple grapes (and red wine) its deep hue.\n\nHowever, if you're not careful, the amount of alcohol you consume can easily tally up to unhealthy amounts. According to Dr Donald Ford, a family physician from Cleveland Clinic, \u201ca little red wine\u201d can translate into \u201cseveral glasses\u201d, with the same applying to other drinks like hard liquor or beer.\n\nModerate consumption is defined as the following: a small glass (125ml) of wine, one can of beer (340 ml) or 25ml of spirits (40% alcohol per volume), according to the American Heart Association.\n\nBinge drinking, the most common form of excessive drinking, can be defined as follows, according to a previous Health24 article:\n\nFor women, consuming four or more drinks on a single occasion\n\nFor men, consuming five or more drinks on a single occasion\n\nHeavy drinking can be defined as:\n\nFor women, consuming eight or more drinks per week\n\nFor men, consuming 15 or more drinks per week\n\nThe red flags \u2013 are you more dependent on alcohol than you think?\n\nFor a lot of South Africans, a couple of drinks per week, or a weekend of binge drinking equates to nothing but innocent fun. But not only can excessive alcohol usage wreak chaos on your weight and overall health \u2013 you might be more dependent on alcohol than you think, without realising that there is a problem.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to drink large amounts of alcohol on a daily basis to have a drinking problem. If you drink too much too fast, you have a drinking problem,\u201d states Dr Joseph Janesz, an addiction specialist from Cleveland Clinic.\n\nHere are some of the things to look out for to determine whether you might have a more serious dependence on alcohol:\n\nYou absolutely can\u2019t face a social event without alcohol \u2013 you find social obligations without alcohol tedious and boring.\n\nYou often black out, lose control or suffer from hangovers because of the amount you drink.\n\nYou deny that you are drinking too much.\n\nYou\u2019ve had accidents, injuries or incidents related to excessive drinking \u2013 car accidents, a fall, fights or altercations because of drunkenness.\n\nIf you need to \u201cpre-drink\u201d or \u201cpre-game\u201d before going out, despite knowing that you will be drinking later.\n\nAccording to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), someone with problematic drinking habits will continue to drink, even when their health is taking strain and they know that their behaviour is problematic.\n\nWhere to find help if you suspect a drinking problem\n\nAlcoholics Anonymous South Africa is a helpful first step if you do admit that you have a drinking problem, even if you feel it\u2019s not that advanced yet. You can consult their website for more information or the nearest location to you.\n\nAvoid overdoing it\n\nWhether you agree with the consept of OcSober or not, there are ways to curb your alcohol intake. Not only will this be good for your weight, but also your overall wellbeing. Donna van Zyl, a registered dietitian, gave the following tips:\n\nAlternate your alcoholic drinks with a sugar-free low-kilojoule non-alcoholic drink, such as sugar-free frizzy drinks with lemon slices or a Rock Shandy (\u00bd sugar-free lemonade, \u00bd soda water, lemon and bitters).\n\nAdd soda water to alcoholic beverages, such as wine, to decrease the alcohol and kilojoule content.\n\nReduce volumes of alcohol by using smaller glasses and adding lots of ice to drinks.\n\nDrink slowly to reduce the number of drinks you consume per occasion.\n\nReconsider your mixers \u2013 instead of mixing your spirits with sugary drinks or tonic water, switch to soda water and a dash of lime.\n\nBesides making physical swops to cut back kilojoules and lessen your consumption, there are also times when you need to realise that alcohol doesn\u2019t have to be part and parcel of every social event:\n\nAsk yourself WHY you need to drink when surrounding yourself with specific people. Is it because of boredom or peer pressure?\n\nFind a physical activity that forces you to watch your intake, like committing to an activity such as a hike or a road race.\n\nWhen you drink, be mindful about it \u2013 ask yourself if you're enjoying that glass of wine because of the taste and experience, or whether you need it to take the edge off a stressful day, event or occasion.\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "For many South Africans, OcSober has started.
