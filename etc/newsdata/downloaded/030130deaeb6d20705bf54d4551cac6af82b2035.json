A backyard barbecue? A day to honor workers? A day to reflect on the battles waged by the union movement to help workers get a fairer slice of the pie their labors helped bake?\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about all the above, along with something else: big changes in a key corner of economic policy that are having a profound and positive effect on the most economically vulnerable worker. I\u2019m referring to developments in monetary policy as practiced by the Federal Reserve that are facilitating tighter labor markets, which, in turn, are helping to boost living standards for working people.\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not here to sugarcoat the outlook for American workers, who face blustering head winds from a set of trends that have broken against them. Any pro-worker, policy agenda must ameliorate those factors (I suggest how below). But it\u2019s a lot better to have that fight with unemployment at 4 percent vs. 6 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s still the case that the best, most direct way to raise the bargaining power of middle- and lower-wage workers is through union coverage, and the share of the workforce covered by unions is down from its peak of about a third in the mid-1950s to about a tenth today. Importantly, it\u2019s not that people don\u2019t want to be represented by unions: Just last week, Vox reported \u201csupport for unions is about as high as it\u2019s been in 50 years.\u201d\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t increasing support for unions translate to increased union membership? Because the power base in this economy has shifted strongly to forces that aim to suppress labor costs and boost corporate profits. As shown in a recent analysis by Heidi Shierholz, the rise and fall of unions over the past century is strongly, and negatively, correlated with the fall and rise of income inequality (the correlation is, in fact, -0.9, where -1 is a perfect, negative correlation). We\u2019re all correctly taught that correlation does not equal causation. In this case, however, I\u2019ll confidently assert that the causal linkages are real.\n\nThe surest way to meet the demand for more union coverage is to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, a smart, comprehensive measure that, if enacted, has real potential to reverse the negative trend in union membership. It\u2019s worth noting that among the Democratic candidates for president, former vice president Joe Biden (full disclosure: my former employer), consistent with his long track record of pulling hard for more union power, strongly supports the PRO Act.\n\nBut while unions are the most direct source of bargaining power, there\u2019s an indirect force that can still be tapped to help workers: full employment.\n\nWhen the job market gets tight and stays tight, a lot of good things happen to workers that don\u2019t occur in slack labor markets. By definition, tight labor markets mean low unemployment, so more job seekers find work. But such conditions are a big plus for the much larger group of incumbent workers, as well. Those wanting (or needing) to move from part-time to full-time work can more easily do so. As the unemployment rate fell about six points from its peak in this expansion (from 10 percent in late 2009 to just below 4 percent now), the share of involuntary part-timers fell four points and is now, at 2.5 percent, near its historical low point.\n\nWage growth also accelerated in tight labor markets, as workers have options they lack in weaker periods, forcing employers to pay more to get and keep the workers they need. That\u2019s one reason quit rates (voluntary separations), now at their highest point in this expansion, go up in recoveries. After a union, there\u2019s no more powerful bargaining chip than the opportunity to leave a bad job for a better job.\n\nThe figure below shows how nominal hourly wages of middle-wage workers respond to slack: They decelerated until the job market tightened up, at which point they started to climb. Again, no sugarcoating: The gains have been choppy, and when we adjust for inflation, as wage analyst Elise Gould shows in a new paper, the current tight job market is delivering less to workers than the last time we closed in on full employment in the latter half of the 1990s. (One reason is that productivity growth \u2014 output per hour \u2014 was faster back then, so employers could raise wages while shaving less off their profit margins.)\n\nStill, both of these high-pressure labor markets shared a critically important characteristic: The Federal Reserve accommodated the tightening. It sounds simple and obvious \u2014 why wouldn\u2019t the central bank do so? The answer is that the Fed, which moves its benchmark interest rate up and down to slow and speed the economy, has a mandate to balance the trade-off between tighter labor markets and higher inflation, i.e., the negative correlation between unemployment and inflation.\n\nThe problem with that formulation is that ever since the 1990s, that correlation has diminished, and labor advocates like me have argued for \u201clower-for-longer\u201d: Let the labor market run hotter for longer so its benefits can reach those left behind.\n\nWhat\u2019s so notable about the current moment is the top officials at the Fed are explicitly making these connections. In a speech just over a week ago, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell emphasized how the high-pressure job market was reaching people in \u201clow- and middle-income communities,\u201d and how it was leading employers to train \u201cworkers who lack required skills, adapting jobs to the needs of employees with family responsibilities, and offering second chances to people who need one.\u201d In words particularly germane to Labor Day, Powell argued that the Fed\u2019s \u201cchallenge now is to do what monetary policy can do to sustain the expansion so that the benefits of the strong jobs market extend to more of those still left behind \u2026\u201d\n\nTo be clear, the Fed\u2019s leaders haven\u2019t punted on their mandate to carefully monitor inflation, nor should they. It\u2019s just that they\u2019re not letting the phantom menace of price pressures that aren\u2019t in the data lead them to shut down a job market that\u2019s finally delivering some bargaining clout to those who need it more.\n\nSo here\u2019s my Labor Day message. There\u2019s no question that strong forces have long aligned against workers in this country. But these forces can be reversed by a potent combination of tight labor markets and growing unions. Together, they are a one-two punch that can knock out even the deepest-pocketed adversary who stands between working America and economic justice.", "description": "Strong forces have long aligned against workers in this country.
