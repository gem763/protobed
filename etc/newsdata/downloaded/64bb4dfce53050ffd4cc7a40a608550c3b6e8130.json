To ensure an audit is sound, the CPAB seeks access to any substantial work done abroad on the foreign operations of those companies.\n\nThis would usually entail asking an accounting firm to contact any \u201ccomponent\u201d auditors outside of Canada to access their working papers, Paradine said in an interview with the Financial Post. Some jurisdictions have restrictions on such information leaving the country, which the CPAB could try to gain access to by working with local authorities or by travelling there as part of the inspection, she added.\n\nBut in a report last week, CPAB noted that \u201ccertain countries,\u201d including China, are still blocking the regulator from inspecting audit work being done there.\n\n\u201cOn the matter of access to audit work performed outside of Canada, CPAB continues to experience barriers as we conduct our inspections,\u201d the report said. \u201cInvestors should be concerned when foreign laws and regulations impede or reduce the level of auditor oversight that they have come to expect in Canada.\u201d\n\nOn the same day its latest report was released, the Canadian Securities Administrators (which, along with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, created CPAB in 2003) published proposed rules that could compel some reporting issuers and audit firms to ensure the CPAB is given \u201cenhanced access\u201d to working papers, particularly in other countries.\n\nParadine said the proposals would help put the board\u2019s access on par with that enjoyed by its counterpart in the U.S.\n\nIt would not open up China, though, which has long irked outsiders over a lack of access to the audit files of Chinese companies. Relations between China and Canada have also become strained since the arrest of a Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. executive last year in Vancouver.\n\nAlthough the last correspondence was in February, the talks with China have not formally ended, Paradine said, adding that some personnel they had been speaking with may have left their positions.\n\nParadine said they were at the stage of drafting documentation, \u201cbut until you\u2019ve completed discussions, negotiations \u2026 it\u2019s hard to tell where it would have ended up.\u201d\n\nCPAB continues to experience barriers as we conduct our inspections CPAB report\n\nThe report released by the CPAB last Thursday was an overview of the audit quality assessments it had completed so far this year of Canada\u2019s four biggest public accounting firms: Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PwC.\n\nCPAB reported three out of the four firms (it did not say which) had seen improvements.\n\n\u201cIt is CPAB\u2019s expectation that audit firms should achieve a performance target of at least 90 per cent of files inspected with no significant findings by 2021,\u201d the report said. \u201cCurrently, one firm is meeting this target; we have observed that this firm is also the most advanced in formalizing its quality management systems.\u201d\n\nSignificant findings are \u201cdeficiencies in the application of generally accepted auditing standards that could result in a restatement of the company\u2019s financials,\u201d the report said.\n\nParadine said that the CPAB sees the 2021 goal as a realistic one because, at various times, they\u2019ve seen other members of the Big Four beating that target.\n\nOut of the 66 audit engagement files the board has reviewed so far this year (out of 72 due to be checked by the end of 2019), there were significant findings in 12, which was lower than last year.\n\n\u2022 Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne", "description": "Trade environment impacting access to audits of Canadian firms in China", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/a637850838.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
