Can Donald Trump really make good on his promise to build a wall along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexican border to prevent illegal migration? What\u0092s more, can he make Mexico pay for it? Sure, he can build it, but it\u0092s not nearly as simple as he says. (AP Photo/Russell Contreras)\n\nYou may have noticed in reports about illegal immigration that there\u2019s been a precipitous drop in apprehensions at the border. That\u2019s not because there are fewer being caught, that\u2019s because there are fewer coming across.\n\nThat\u2019s in large measure due to the cooperation deal that President Donald Trump struck with Mexico.\n\nIn fact, even CNN has had to admit Trump\u2019s success, as Newsbusters observed.\n\nIn an astonishing case of pigs flying, CNN actually ran article on Sunday by Catherine Shoichet and Natalie Gall\u00f3n, \u201cWhy some say Mexico already built Trump\u2019s wall \u2014 and paid for it.\u201d\n\nIn it they note that Mexico has effectively built the wall, that Mexico by marshaling thousands of their troops to prevent people from coming in and not going north to the U.S. is acting as the wall itself.\n\nAmong the things they have done:\n\nNearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico\u2019s northern border, where they\u2019ve set up 20 checkpoints, Mexican Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country\u2019s security strategy. At the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints.\n\nAnd it\u2019s worked.\n\nAsked to respond to claims that Mexico is effectively paying for the wall Trump wanted, foreign ministry spokesman Roberto Velasco told CNN that migration flows have notably decreased in recent months, and that efforts continue for a regional development plan to address the root causes of migration in Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. \u201cThe number of migrants presented before Mexican authorities has decreased by 70% from June to September,\u201d he said.\n\nThis all came after the threat of tariffs from Trump earlier in the year.\n\nCNN doesn\u2019t seem completely pleased while noting this success, quoting Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos, \u201cIt\u2019s true: President Trump is using Mexico. And, against all logic, Mexico is letting him get away with it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis has to change.\u201d\n\nWhy would you want to stop success? Because it doesn\u2019t align with the Democratic effort to open the borders?\n\nBut in this case, it\u2019s also to Mexico\u2019s benefit because they\u2019re protecting their own sovereignty as well as preventing folks from getting north to get to the United States.\n\nSo will other media pick up on this and give credit where credit is due?", "description": "CNN: Mexico Has Essentially Built Trump\u2019s Wall and Is Paying for It", "authors": ["Nick Arama", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Joe Cunningham", "Brandon Morse", "Alex Parker", "Sister Toldjah", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ap-border-wall-e1487542605382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
