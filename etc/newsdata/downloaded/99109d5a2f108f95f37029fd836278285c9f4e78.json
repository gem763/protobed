Before becoming the gunslinger everyone knows today, Favre had 70 touchdown passes and 51 interceptions in his first 47 games in Green Bay. His completion percentage was only 62 percent and he took 95 sacks.\n\nSAM DARNOLD'S PERFORMANCE VS. PATRIOTS GETS SPOOKY IN JETS BLOWOUT LOSS: 'I'M SEEING GHOSTS'\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a term that Mike Holmgren would say to me quite often, my first one, two, three years with the Packers,\u201d Favre said in an interview on SiriusXM NFL Radio. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new term.\u201d\n\nFavre said that \u201cseeing ghosts\u201d is part of the growing pains with young players. Darnold is only in his second season and had his worst performance of his career throwing for fewer than 100 yards and tossing four interceptions in the 33-0 loss.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing other than being a young player,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing exposed to a lot of stuff, and really not so much thrown to the wolves \u2014 I don\u2019t think Adam Gase did anything wrong. You\u2019ve got to go in and play.\n\nTOM BRADY 'SETTING UP TO MOVE ON' FROM PATRIOTS, NFL INSIDER THEORIZES\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to go with all your guns blazing, and if he makes mistakes, he makes mistakes. The key is that you learn from them, and you\u2019re going to make more... Over time, the thought is that you see less and less, and you become very familiar with your offense, and I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s often overlooked. I mean, this is a new offense to him, and it\u2019s not to Tom Brady and (Patriots offensive coordinator) Josh McDaniels.\u201d\n\nDarnold made the \u201cseeing ghosts\u201d comments in the second quarter of the game. The remark went viral on social media almost immediately after he said it.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nGase and running back Le\u2019Veon Bell both expressed their frustrations with the comment getting to air.", "description": "When Sam Darnold was caught saying he was \u201cseeing ghosts\u201d during Monday night\u2019s blowout loss against the New England Patriots, it resonated with a Hall of Fame quarterback.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
