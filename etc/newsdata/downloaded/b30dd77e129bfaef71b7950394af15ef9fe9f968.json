They are out on bond and are due back in court on Nov. 14th.\n\nDanby House \u2014 which has been under investigation by police since June \u2014 told WGHP they fired the three workers when they learned of the accusations and have implemented a more rigorous employment process.\n\nThe North Carolina Department of Health banned Danby House from accepting new patients, citing multiple \u201cdeficiencies\u201d they found in their own investigation, according to the Winston-Salem Journal.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
