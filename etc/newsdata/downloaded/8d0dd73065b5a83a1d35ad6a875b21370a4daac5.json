(Image: NBC Universal)\n\nAll of this has happened before, and all of this will happen again. Because literally, that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re rebooting Battlestar Galactica again.\n\nDeadline reports that NBC Universal has tapped Mr. Robot\u2019s Sam Esmail to headline a reboot of the beloved sci-fi series Battlestar Galactica for its newly unveiled streaming service. Which is called Peacock.\n\nYes, really.\n\nAnyway, so far not much is known about the reboot, other than Esmail\u2019s involvement and that it\u2019s now happening. NBC Universal has a long history with the series\u2014about the last remnants of humanity on the run from a sinister, overwhelmingly powerful race of robots called the Cylons \u2014 of course, having produced Glen A. Larson\u2019s original in 1978, which ran for just one season on ABC, and then produced Ronald D. Moore\u2019s beloved reboot, which aired on Syfy from 2004 to 2009.\n\nBut I guess, in this age of streaming wars, every company around looking to make their own platform is returning to past successes in the hopes of making it new again for streaming.\n\nIn the sci-fi realm Disney has Star Wars, CBS of course has Star Trek, Apple now has Jason Momoa. And now, NBC has Battlestar again.\n\nIn the wake of this news, Esmail took to Twitter to clarify his show is not a remake of the 2004 series, or seemingly even the 1978 version. Instead, it is a \u201cnew story within the mythology\u201d:\n\nBSG fans, this will NOT be a remake of the amazing series @RonDMoore launched because... why mess with perfection? Instead, we\u2019ll explore a new story within the mythology while staying true to the spirit of Battlestar. So say we all! \u2014 Sam Esmail (@samesmail) September 17, 2019\n\nWhat this actually means is unclear. Is it set in the same universe as the 2004 reboot? Is it a prequel like Caprica? Somehow a continuation to what was a pretty definitive end, whether you loved or hated it? We\u2019ll have to wait and see.\n\nPeacock is set to launch in the U.S. in April 2020.", "description": "All of this has happened before, and all of this will happen again.
