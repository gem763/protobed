Through art and a multimedia experience created by the university, the exhibit is intended to spark an international conversation about the meaning of liberty and how the concept of liberty has evolved.\n\n\u201cWhat we wanted to do with the Santa Croce team was to think about how we could bring the conversation into today\u2019s culture. We think about the 50th commemoration of May 4 and the lead up to the presidential election. How do we take this historical understanding of liberty and this partnership between Italy and the U.S. to create an international conversation about liberty today?\u201d said J.R. Campbell, director of Kent\u2019s Design Innovation Initiative who led the project with James Blank, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and David Hassler, director of the Wick Poetry Center.\n\nThe exhibit will feature an 80% to scale replica of Pio Fedi\u2019s \u201cLiberty of Poetry\u201d that is housed at the church and is said to have served as the basis for the Statue of Liberty. The statue honors Giovanni Battista Niccolini, a poet who inspired and supported the Risorgimento, the Italian struggle for self-determination.\n\nWith permission from the Vatican, Kent neuroscientist Robert Clements and Josh Talbott, both of whom have a background in 3-D imaging, traveled to Florence to 3-D scan the statue over a three-day period using technology from Exact Metrology. They then returned to Kent to process 30 to 40 gigabytes of data and create a blueprint for a 3-D printer.\n\nFreshmade3D, a Youngstown-based start-up company, printed the replica in three sections, so that the statue could be transported easily to New York and also fit in Ellis Island\u2019s small elevators and narrow corridors. Tamara Honesty, an assistant professor of scenic design, and a team of students painted the statue, which is made of a combination of sand and resin, to make it look like the original.\n\nThe exhibit also features the Wick Poetry Center\u2019s \u201clistening wall,\u201d an interactive screen where people can listen to and review documents from the Library of Congress focused on the ever-evolving interpretation of liberty and create and record their own interpretations. Wick originally intended the listening wall to be used for the May 4 commemoration and won a $50,000 grant from the Knight Prototype fund to create it, Hassler said.\n\nAdditional listening walls will be stationed at Kent\u2019s Integrated Sciences Building and at the Cathedral Santa Croce. User-generated content will be automatically synced between the three listening walls, allowing Kent residents to view and listen to international input.\n\n\u201cNow people around the world can speak to what they consider to be liberty and how they respond to these texts and documents, which I think is a really amazing thing,\u201d said Jessica Jewell, Wick program director.\n\nThe \u201cLiberty of Poetry\u201d replica will be on display in New York through April 26, 2020, at which point it will return to Kent State\u2019s Integrated Sciences Building just in time for the 50th anniversary of May 4, a mere coincidence, Blank said. Following the 50th commemoration, it will find a permanent home at the Design Innovation Hub.\n\n\u201cThe timing is everything. It\u2019s like somebody wrote the script and we just walked into it,\u201d Blank said.\n\n\u201cModern technologies have been used and created for looking at CT scans or teaching students how to look at chemical molecules, but they can also be applied to bringing art to the world from a sacred place on earth where the Renaissance began and where people were talking about democracy and self determination.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/35oTlqb\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Record-Courier, http://www.recordpub.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kent State's latest cross-discipline project will soon connect the university and city with art and history lovers in New York City and Florence, Italy.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Krista S.
