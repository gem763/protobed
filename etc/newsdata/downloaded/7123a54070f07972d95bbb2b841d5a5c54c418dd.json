We do not comment on rumors on a report that is not public,\u201d an Airbus spokesperson said. A spokesperson for the European Commission said Brussels would \u201cnot comment on leaks\u201d but said it has \u201ccommunicated to the United States that the European Union is ready to work on a fair and balanced solution for our respective aircraft industries.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. first filed a complaint in Geneva against the EU in 2006. Washington has estimated the amount of damage resulting from EU subsidies that are still in place at $11 billion.\n\nA parallel complaint by the EU, alleging illegal U.S. subsidies for Boeing, is running with some 6 months of delay. The EU expects the outcome of that case to give the bloc the right to retaliate with its own tariffs next year, and hopes to strike an agreement with Washington to lift the sanctions.\n\n\u201cIn the parallel Boeing case, we are expecting the WTO decision on the European Union sanction rights in the coming months,\u201d the Commission spokesperson said. \u201cThe mutual imposition of sanctions is counterproductive and damaging to our respective economies \u2026 The EU has, as recently as July, submitted concrete proposals to the US to which there has been no reaction so far. The EU\u2019s willingness to find a fair settlement remains unchanged.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: Sanctions\n\nAirbus\n\nTrade", "description": "The ruling ends a decades-long dispute.", "authors": ["Jakob Hanke"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/06/6a/abf4daa34bf288c7e53e996e5b37/19914-airbus-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
