Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told The Daily Beast on Tuesday that the Trump administration\u2019s so-called maximum pressure campaign on Iran isn\u2019t achieving its purpose.\n\n\u201cClearly what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working,\u201d Graham said, adding that the goal of the administration\u2019s Iran policy should be to deter Tehran from escalating tensions in the region.\n\nFollowing his phone call with The Daily Beast, Graham in a series of tweets called on the Trump administration to do more, saying the \u201cmeasured response\u201d by President Trump is \u201cseen by the Iranian regime as an act of weakness.\u201d On the same night as a Tuesday fundraising event in Silicon Valley, Trump tweeted back at Graham: \u201cNo Lindsey, it was a sign of strength that some people just don\u2019t understand!\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has for years carried out a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran, enlisting the Treasury and State Departments to annihilate the country\u2019s economy via sanctions. With each new month it seems as though the administration finds a new Iranian company or sector to punish financially.\n\nThat strategy has been put to the test in recent months. Earlier this summer the Trump administration accused Tehran of sabotaging tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. Since then, Democrats on Capitol Hill have called on Team Trump to change course, saying the campaign to deter Iran via sanctions was falling flat.\n\nOne of the main architects of the maximum pressure strategy was former National Security Adviser John Bolton, an openly hawkish politico who has supported the idea of American military action against the Iranian regime. With his departure, the Trump team has leaned increasingly on the Pentagon for guidance on Iran. Graham seems to be filling the Bolton void, calling on the president to take \u201cdecisive action\u201d against Tehran.\n\nDid Trump and Bolton Break Over Iran\u2014or the Leaks?\n\n\u201cThe problems with Iran only get worse over time so it is imperative we take decisive action to deter further aggression by the Ayatollah and his henchman,\u201d Graham tweeted Tuesday.\n\nThe divergence between Trump and Graham is notable given that the Trump administration recently enlisted the senator to engage with outside parties about what a new Iranian nuclear deal may look like.\n\nIn a previous interview with The Daily Beast, the senator said he spoke with the Trump team about the idea of asking the Iranian regime to agree to a so-called 123 Agreement\u2014a key, legally binding commitment that requires countries doing nuclear deals with the U.S. to sign on to nonproliferation standards. The U.S. has entered into those agreements with more than 40 countries.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has also been involved in conversations with the Trump administration on Iran strategy. Following Trump\u2019s tweet Tuesday night, Paul\u2019s chief strategist tweeted at Trump, saying of Graham, \u201cDRAG HIM.\u201d\n\nGraham told The Daily Beast on Tuesday that he had not spoken with Trump about the attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure but said the Israelis were \u201cincreasingly concerned\u201d about the situation.\n\n\u201cThis is a provocative regime that shoots its own people down in the street, that threatens the existence of the state of Israel. This is an enemy of mankind, and if you are not willing to take this enemy on, you will regret it,\u201d Graham said in an interview with The Daily Beast in August.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time the president found himself disagreeing on foreign policy with the senator, a former foe who has become a top confidant and sounding board for Trump.\n\nIn the days since the attack, Trump has indicated to those close to him that he favors restraint over military strikes, and certainly over starting a war with Iran. According to two people who\u2019ve heard the president say this, Trump has asked advisers and senior officials why the Saudis can\u2019t just \u201chandle it\u201d themselves, and has made clear he\u2019d prefer the United States not intervene militarily.\n\nThat could, of course, change very quickly, if recent history is any guide. In June, the president approved strikes on Iran\u2014strikes that were projected to kill at least dozens of Iranians\u2014only to call the whole thing off not long before the U.S. would have attacked Iran.\n\nOne factor driving Trump\u2019s reluctance to bomb or go to war with Iran lies in his desire to win re-election next year.", "description": "Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/GettySen.
