And if your first date is someone you met on a dating app and have no ties to, those feelings of awkwardness could be heightened: One study found that college-age students expected their first dates to be more casual and intimate when they knew their date as an acquaintance or friend first.\n\nStill, it's possible to make the most of a first date, even if you go into it as strangers.\n\nKelly Scott, a therapist at Tribeca Therapy, told Business Insider that she has integrated online-dating advice into some of her single patients' sessions to help them find quality first dates and understand why past experiences may have fallen flat. Here, Scott offers three steps she thinks all daters should complete when going on a first date.\n\nRead more: If you're the victim of an affair, you might want to revenge cheat. A therapist says the move could ruin your relationship for good.\n\nBe upfront about your deal breakers\n\nBefore you meet up with your date, or even before you match with someone on a dating app, it's important you're honest with yourself about the things you need in a long-term partner, Scott said.\n\nWhether you absolutely would never date a smoker, or you need to be with someone who also wants to start a family, knowing your deal breakers before you pursue a relationship will make the experience that much more fulfilling because you know you're not wasting your time (or your prospective date's time) with a dead-end experience.\n\nThough you won't necessarily bring up these deal breakers on your first date \u2014 Scott said they should come up naturally within your first few dates \u2014 knowing them ahead of your first meeting will help you keep your priorities straight and notice any red flags that suggest this person isn't right for you.\n\nRead more: How to prevent wedding-planning stress from ruining the big day, according to a therapist devoted to anxious brides\n\nScott said it's easy to get caught up in the whirlwind feeling of an exciting first date, but people should \"treat every interaction as collecting data\" when they're initially learning about a love interest. \"People misinterpret and ignore things to their detriment,\" she added, and may end up dating someone who turned out to be different from the person they thought they were.\n\nDon't take the date too seriously\n\nTake every good and bad interaction on your date with a grain of salt.

Whether you had an amazing time, an OK time, or a not-so-great time, Scott said you should find a nice way to tell your date where you see things going.\n\nIf you're not interested in going on another date, say something like, \"Listen, you're really lovely, but I'm not feeling it,\" Scott said. Say, \"Thank you,\" too.\n\nBeing so straightforward can be scary, especially in a time when it's so easy to hide behind a text or dating-app message, but it's considerate to be up front about your feelings. And for goodness sake, don't ghost a first date if you're not feeling it, even if you're fearful of how they'll respond.\n\nIf someone \"is intimidated by your forwardness, then that's not the person for you,\" Scott said.", "description": "First dates can be awkward, but if you know your deal breakers and don't put too much pressure on yourself, you're likely to have a good one.", "authors": ["Julia Naftulin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d950633cb9a5f12833db900?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
