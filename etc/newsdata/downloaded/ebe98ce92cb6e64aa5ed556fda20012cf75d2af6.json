Lots? We thought so.\n\nAnd that\u2019s mostly because couples will have lived together for many years before getting married, just to make sure they\u2019re doing the right thing\u2026 And along the way, they\u2019ve traded in their Sainsbury\u2019s Home kettle from uni for something a little more grown up.\n\nPeople are generally getting married later, and thus don\u2019t need the help \u201csetting up home\u201d anymore \u2013 so don\u2019t even think about buying the newlyweds something like as boring as an iron.\n\nConsidering the average wedding costs in the region of \u00a330,000 couples usually need help with the wedding, or the honeymoon. But for some guests, slotting some cold hard cash into a card feels impersonal, especially for really close friends and immediate family, who might want to opt for investment pieces, or something personalised.\n\nThere\u2019s still a huge market for wedding gifts, and we think it's more fun to think outside the box and find something more exciting than matching bath towel sets. Gift giving is at its best when it\u2019s something you know the couple will love, but won\u2019t have had the time or money to buy it.\n\nAnd in the age of renting, many people won\u2019t have bought the art prints they love in fear of damaging walls, and couldn't dream of spending a large chunk of their rent of a Le Cruset dish \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t love one.\n\nWe were looking for original products for couples from film, to gardening, travelling and art, covering different budgets, starting from a token \u00a315, as well as products from well-known brands worth investing in to small independent businesses we\u2019ve found on Instagram.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice.

Go for his n hers and monogram the luggage tags with their initials too. We love how beautifully these glide along the floor and the whole range is made from aerospace-grade polycarbonate that\u2019s incredibly light. There\u2019s lots of nifty bits inside like a little removable laundry bag, a little zip for your cables, a compression pad and integrated TSA locks on the outside. There\u2019s more than enough room for a week-long trip and certainly a two-week summer honeymoon. They\u2019re made to last and worth the investment for the serial holidaying couple. Dimensions: H64 x W46 x D24cm.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe White Company fine 5x7 silver photo frame: \u00a345, The White Company\n\nEvery newly married couple will want to frame at least a million (accurate estimation) of their special day snaps, and none will look better than in a silver plated frame with a black and white print. We love these from The White Company for its fine silver frame and large white mount: it\u2019s elegant and timeless and everyone will be drawn to it in the couple's house, plsu they won\u2019t stop staring at it for months, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nBuy now\n\nCotton Poet personalised duvet cover: From \u00a390 for a double, Cotton Poet\n\nThese 300 thread count bed sheets are designed in London and made in Portugal, and are super soft, with a luxurious looking and feeling silky sheen. We love the double cord stitching which contrasts and the discreet button fastening on the duvet cover. Our favourite of the nine colours to choose from is the dove grey. But what we love most about this set is that you can personalise it. Add initials of the newlyweds in the matching embroidered colour \u2013 just make sure you\u2019re certain on surnames. Pillowcases and sheets sold separately from \u00a327, and have Shakespeare's Hamlet quote: \"to sleep, perchance to dream\" embroidered in white cotton along the top. Bedding comes in a cute drawstring cotton bedding bag which is great for storage too.\n\nBuy now\n\nEleanor Bowmer it\u2019s love personalised rainbow print: From \u00a315, Eleanor Bowmer\n\nFrom one of our favourite artists is this cute print love heart that can be personalised with the couple\u2019s initials and wedding date.

With a choice of eight endangered animals, ranging from the brown throated sloth to the smooth hammerhead shark, 10 per cent from the sale of each jumper is donated to the relevant wildlife charity such as The Fox Project and Shark Trust. The brand\u2019s ethos is to \u201cwear and care\u201d at the same time. We also love that there\u2019s absolutely no plastic packaging used. Go for matching animals in different colours (and choose between the animal being in the centre of the chest or to the left) or vice versa for an adorable gift they\u2019ll wear all the time. We love the red fox and the orca whale the best.\n\nBuy now\n\nDibor personalised set of two wicker gardening tool baskets: \u00a399, Not On The High Street\n\nFor those who love to garden together these wicker basket sets come with everything they need to get next year\u2019s vegetables well on their way.

There\u2019s only 75 available of this one, and they\u2019re made with acrylic paint, pastel and pen on acrylic paper.

This one is about about as big as it comes from photographer Steve Curry, who documented countries and people from the Middle East to Myanmar over the course of his 40 year \u2013 and counting \u2013 career. He\u2019s best known for his photo of \u201cthe Afghan girl\u201d with her green eyes, dark hair and red shawl which was on the cover of National Geographic in 1984, and has apparently become one of the world\u2019s most recognisable photos. Photography and travel fans will love this book on Afghanistan, published in 2017, which features 140 images taken across a decade of visiting there, with incredible scenery and war-stricken backdrops. In 2004, he founded ImagineAsia which helps provide educational resources to children and young adults in Afghanistan.\n\nBuy now\n\nKodak Luma 350 smart HD ready mini projector: \u00a3370, Currys\n\nFilm buffs will take serious pride in their Friday night film club with one of these, but of course first it will be the wedding video going round on loop. We love how compact it is and of course, portable so when the weather\u2019s good, they\u2019ll even be able to watch films outside. It has a two-hour rechargeable battery, and it can even be projected from your phone, but you can also load films onto the microSD so you can go wireless, too.\n\nBuy now\n\nPersonalised Ordnance Survey map: From \u00a324.99, Stanfords\n\nUsing OS maps, Stanfords Travel bookshop have created a bespoke maps service centred around a sentimental place. Just use a postcode of either the couple\u2019s wedding location or where they met or got engaged and have their names added to the bottom too.

As with all of the brand\u2019s cookware \u2013 if looked after properly \u2013 it will last more than a lifetime, and is worth its weight in gold. This one is also so versatile and is technically a 4-in-1, as you can use it for casseroles, stir-frys, bake in it and use it as a roasting dish, plus you can use it to serve on the table too. It can be used in the oven, on the hob, under the grill and even on a bbq \u2013 weather permitting. Also, if you\u2019re lucky enough, you might be invited round and whipped up a feast in it, post wedding as a rather fitting thank you.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Wedding gift ideas\n\nWe love the Horzn Studios suitcase: they\u2019ll last a lifetime and the couples who constantly holiday will never want to part with them. Yes, it's a hefty price tag, but will be well-loved. For a token gift, go for Eleanor Bowmer's It\u2019s Love print, and for something inbetween, personalise the gorgeous Cotton Poet bed sheets.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
