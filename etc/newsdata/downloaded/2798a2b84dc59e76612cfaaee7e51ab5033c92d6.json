Until recently, following up with those impacted by Ebola was a difficult task for contract tracers.\n\n\u201cWe used to use paper, filling out a form each day for every contact,\u201d Kavira Kasomo, a contract tracer, said in a WHO article announcing the app. \u201cThen at the end of the day, we took the papers to our supervisors, who alerted the doctor if one of the contacts had signs of Ebola. It took a long time.\u201d\n\nWalking around neighborhoods carrying folders of documents would also raise suspicions from the local community, Kasomo added, with people fearful of being taken away and quarantined if they show any signs of the disease.\n\n\u201cSometimes when I was carrying papers, I would be chased away, and then I wouldn\u2019t be able to go back for days,\u201d added Jean-Baptiste Kahehoro, another contact tracer.\n\nGo.Data, a new application designed by the WHO, allows information they gather to be sent directly to their supervisors for analysis, which they argue is a \u201cmajor innovation in outbreak investigation tools for field data collection.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is particularly focused on case and contact data collection and management,\u201d says Armand Bejtullahu, the project leader at WHO and one of the leading designers of the app. \u201cThis allows the software to produce outputs, such as contact follow-up forms and dynamic visualization of chains of transmission.\u201d\n\nOther benefits of the technology are explained in detail by the WHO:\n\nAs well as speeding up contact tracing, Go.Data helps field teams make sure contacts are not lost. Sometimes, contact tracers are not able to visit all their contacts, perhaps because insecurity in the area prevents them from accessing a household or because of other issues. \u201cWhen a contact is missed,\u201d says Dr Papy Musakasombo, the head of the Mabolio health zone, \u201cwe can see that early enough to do something about it that same day.\u201d For the contact tracers, using a phone means they are less likely to encounter problems in the community. \u201cEveryone has a mobile phone,\u201d says Josu\u00e9 Nebese Kaseme, who is Kanyere\u2019s supervisor. \u201cIt\u2019s much more discreet and easier than carrying around a lot of paper forms.\u201d It also helps the contact feel at ease, he adds. For epidemiologists, the visual representation of the transmission chain created by the Go.Data software is particularly valuable. It allows them to understand more easily and comprehensively how the disease spreads: which activities, environments and types of interaction are associated with high or low transmission rates. This means they can tailor the intervention to more quickly interrupt the spread.\n\nThe app will soon be rolled out to other parts of the Congo in an effort to improve treatment of the country\u2019s current Ebola outbreak, which has affected around 3150 people (over 2,000 of whom have died) since it was declared on August 1st, 2018. However, the app\u2019s designers envision it eventually being used to treat all types of health epidemics all over the world.\n\n\u201cThe Ebola outbreak in the DRC is our major priority,\u201d says Bejtullahu. \u201cGoing forward, hopefully Go. Data can really revolutionize the way we tackle epidemics everywhere.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "The World Health Organization (WHO)\u00a0launched\u00a0an app to help contact tracers monitor cases of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/workers-clinic-ebola-beni-dr-congo-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
