It is channelled through so called \u201ccommunity\u201d groups \u2013 which are being funded by fossil fuel companies.\n\nQ&A What is the polluters project? Show Hide The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis \u2013 some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.\n\nThe investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months. The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute, calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: \"The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.\" One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures \u2013 so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change. Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.\n\nA new study of Facebook\u2019s advertising disclosure platform by InfluenceMap suggests oil companies and their trade groups have spent $17m directly on political social media advertisements since May 2018.\n\nExxonMobil spent $9.6m \u2013 by far the biggest sum \u2013 ConocoPhillips $910,000 and BP $790,000.\n\nThese ads include PR highlighting low carbon alternatives and at the same time involve direct lobbying against climate initiatives and the promotion of continued fossil fuel extraction in the energy mix.\n\nBP\u2019s \u201cpossibilities everywhere\u201d ad campaign on Facebook was launched just weeks after it joined big oil companies to use a \u201ccommunity\u201d group to fight against a bill restricting fracking in Colorado, known as Proposition 112.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest BP\u2019s Facebook ad\n\nProp 112 aimed to increase the distance fracking wells are set back from houses, schools and hospitals from 500ft (about 150 metres) to 2,500ft (760 metres).\n\nIt was designed to protect communities and the environment, and promote the transition from fossil fuels, according to those behind the bill.\n\nBut the campaign by a \u201cgrassroots\u201d group Protect Colorado helped to defeat the bill by a margin of 200,000 votes last November. Protect Colorado\u2019s Facebook page and website list it as a community organisation.\n\nOil firms to pour extra 7m barrels per day into markets, data shows Read more\n\nThey make no mention that the organisation was given $41 million by the oil and gas industry and its trade groups between January and December 2018, according to campaign declarations to the Colorado Secretary of State.\n\nBP gave Protect Colorado $300,000 in October 2018, a month after relocating its US onshore headquarters from Houston to Denver. The move was to help it tap the state\u2019s estimated reserves of 1.3bn barrels of oil and exploit increased production, which has made Colorado the country\u2019s fifth largest oil producer.\n\nGuardian analysis of Facebook\u2019s ad disclosure platform reveals Protect Colorado had an influence reach of up to 3.3 million impressions in the weeks before the vote, in a state with a population of about 5 million people.\n\nThe out-of-state fracking firms Noble Energy and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, based in Houston, Texas, put $6m each into Protect Colorado.\n\nThe oil and gas firm ConocoPhillips gave the group $1m, Denver-based Liberty Oilfield Services provided $749,000 and the Colorado Petroleum Council gave $4.5m to Protect Colorado.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A sign in Denver last year urges voters to reject Proposition 112. Photograph: David Zalubowski/AP\n\nAnne Lee Foster, the communications director at Colorado Rising, which raised $1.2m for its campaign promoting Prop 112, said: \u201cIt felt like an attack on our democracy, where you have these corporations spending millions and millions of dollars, often out-of-state interests, fighting citizens who are simply trying to protect their families.\n\n\u201cWe lost by 200,000 votes, so yes, 100% we believe the vote was swayed by the social media push they financed. They created doubt. They exploited people\u2019s fears that the setback would mean big job losses.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian contacted Protect Colorado but it failed to respond. The Guardian also contacted all the oil and gas companies involved in the campaigning.\n\nBP confirmed it had opposed Prop 112. \u201cBP is open to, and will continue to engage in, substantive discussions about regulatory efforts to address the impacts of oil and gas development.\n\n\u201cWe also remain committed to safe and reliable operations in Colorado \u2013 and everywhere we operate \u2013 as we work to meet society\u2019s demand for cleaner, better energy.\u201d\n\nAt the time of going to press there were no other comments provided.\n\nThe use of groups that term themselves grassroots community organisations but are funded by major companies is known as \u201castroturfing\u201d.\n\nIn 2014, a leaked document from the Western States Petroleum Association \u2013 the oil and gas trade body in states including Washington, Oregon and California \u2013 detailed the use of such community groups to push back against climate campaigners and the anti-oil agenda \u2013 something WSPA described as \u201cthe worst of times\u201d.\n\nResearch for The Guardian by InfluenceMap has uncovered various examples of so called astro turfing. Within the Facebook adverts, the funders tend to be disclosed as the named group behind the adverts with no information on who ultimately controls these groups. Only through further research does oil company support become more clear.\n\nIn Texas a campaign opposing new regulations on oil pipelines in Senate bill 421 is led by Texans for Natural Gas, which is listed as a community group on Facebook.\n\nIt describes itself as a \u201cgrassroots organisation\u201d that gives a voice to those who support Texas oil and natural gas production.\n\nThe Facebook ads against SB 421 are listed as being funded directly by Texans for Natural Gas. The small print at the bottom of the group\u2019s website states: \u201cWe are supported by five of the state\u2019s leading energy companies \u2013 Apache Corp, EnerVest, EOG Resources, Kinder Morgan and XTO Energy\u201d (a subsidiary of ExxonMobil).\n\nMeasure G, a bill to ban new fracking and conventional oil and gas wells in the California county of San Luis Obispo, but allow existing facilities to continue, was defeated last year after an extensive industry-funded campaign against the proposed law, which spent more than $160,000 on more than 500 Facebook adverts, according to the ad library.\n\nMajor oil industry corporations donated about $8m to the No on Measure G campaign, according to local campaign finance filings. Chevron donated half that sum, while Aera Energy, a joint venture between Shell and ExxonMobil, contributed $900,000.\n\nThe campaign in support of the measure raised only $243,000 in the same period.\n\nShell said it opposed Measure G because \u201cit would have shut down a century-old industry in the county, costing hundreds of local legacy jobs, millions in taxes to local coffers and cut off critical energy to an area of the country that has long struggled to keep up with growing demand.\n\n\u201cWhile we share the view that a low-carbon economy will only be possible through a combination of more renewables and biofuels, efficiency standards, CCS [carbon capture and storage] and a carbon tax, cleaner and more convenient hydrocarbons are still needed to provide a full suite of energy products for the growing global population \u2013 especially in areas of industry and transportation that are proving difficult to abate,\u201d a Shell spokesperson said.\n\nBetween September and November 2018, the No on Measure G campaign published several hundred Facebook adverts encouraging residents of San Luis Obispo to oppose the law, according to a Guardian analysis.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A No on Measure G ad. Photograph: Courtesy of No on Measure G\n\nMost of the adverts suggested the measure would cause economic damage, such as job losses, or an increased reliance on foreign oil, and suggested continued fossil fuel use was part of a \u201ctransition to a clean energy economy\u201d.\n\nLast year BP donated $13m to a campaign, also supported by Chevron, that successfully stopped a carbon tax in Washington state \u2013 $1m of which was spent on social media ads, research shows.", "description": "Industry funds \u2018grassroots\u2019 resistance to tougher rules while touting green credentials, study shows", "authors": ["Sandra Laville", "David Pegg", "Sam Cutler", "Michael Barton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1785b305cfeae014c2c7cfa1ee240950a8767dd/386_0_1785_1071/master/1785.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=821d71fe5d155eb82f9fda7bdbb00851", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
