You could easily fill a small- or medium-sized yard with the sound from one Move, and if you need to fill a bigger space, (or if you simply want to make the Move your primary home stereo, rather than an adjunct to a bigger Sonos system) you can always buy a second Move and link them together via Wi-Fi.\n\n(Sadly, though, you can\u2019t buy two Moves and link them into a Sonos surround system as left and right rears. It\u2019s one of the few limitations we found in our review.)\n\nThe Move is what might have once been called a \"luggable\" device, rather than a \"portable\" device.\n\nThat acoustic bigness, though, has been undermined somewhat by the need for the big handle at the back (indeed, by the need for the very notion of a \u201cback\u201d) of the speaker. The Move is much more directional than other devices you might compare it with, such as the Megablast or the Sonos One, and you really do need to be in front of it to hear it at its best. Apple\u2019s HomePod, though not as big and loud, has a bigger and cleaner soundstage.\n\nSimilar to the HomePod, the Move has a feature called \u201cAutomatic Trueplay\u201d, that uses its built-in microphones to recalibrate the speaker\u2019s audio whenever you pick up the device and move it.\n\n(The microphones are there for the Move\u2019s Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa features, which I won\u2019t go into now because a) we've reviewed them many times before and b) Google Assistant was malfunctioning on our review unit.)\n\nAutomatic Trueplay is a nifty, possibly important feature in a device designed to be moved around, and I wish we could say we heard the recalibration make a big difference (or indeed any difference) to the sound, but we couldn\u2019t.\n\nIf ever there was a technology company that designs its products to last, Sonos is it.\n\nWe put the Move in a garbage bin, in a glass tank, in all those places listed above, hoping to hear the magical moment when, 30 seconds after it is moved, the Move adjusts itself to suit its surroundings. I\u2019m sure that audiophiles will tell you that Automatic Trueplay is a big deal, but for us dull-eared Digital Life Lab technicians, the most noticeable result from our tests was the chewing gum that stuck to the base when we put the Move in a bin.\n\nMercifully, the base is made of silicone rubber, so the gum came off easily. The Move is a sturdy, well-built machine which, if it\u2019s anything like any of other Sonos speakers we\u2019ve reviewed, will last you a long time. And I mean, a long, long time. If ever there was a technology company that designs its products to last, Sonos is it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the exception of a CR100 Controller (which has been replaced by free mobile phone apps), all the Sonos equipment we bought for the Digital Life Labs 12 years ago is still in perfect working order and still perfectly up to date, thanks to firmware updates with every new feature over all those years.\n\nThat of course presents a challenge for portable devices. How do you ensure they\u2019re still working a decade from now, when rechargeable batteries last only two or three years before they no longer hold enough charge to be useful?\n\nUnlike the Apple HomePod, you need to point the Sonos Move at you, not away from you.\n\nTrue to its vision of non-disposable tech, Sonos has answered that challenge: the battery in the Sonos Move can be replaced simply by peeling back that silicone rubber base and undoing a few screws.\n\n(I say simply, but we couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it without risking damage to the silicone on our review sample. But I\u2019m sure that, when the time comes and Sonos has made replacement batteries available, there will be YouTube videos showing you how to do it.)\n\nThree and six and nine years from now, when you\u2019ve long since stopped caring about whether you can hear Automatic Trueplay or not, that\u2019s the feature you\u2019ll appreciate the most.\n\nUnlike just about everything else you buy today, the Sonos Move is not something that\u2019s destined for the garbage bin.\n\nSONOS MOVE\n\nLikes Big sound.
