The previous best came in 2011 against Seattle when Washington came back from a 5-1 deficit to win 6-5.\n\nBefore the game teams were 274-0 when ahead by six runs or more going into the ninth inning this season, according to several outlets.\n\nIt was the seventh walk-off win of this season for the Nationals (78-59), who remained 6 1/2 games back of the first-place Atlanta Braves but strengthened their hold on the top spot in the wild-card race.\n\n\u201cBoom! What can you say about the guys? They came right back,\u201d manager Dave Martinez said.\n\nMartinez has said all year his team doesn\u2019t give up. \u201cWe showed that today,\u201d said second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera, who had two hits and scored twice.\n\nJuan Soto had three hits and drove in three runs, and hit his 32nd homer of the year against Mets ace Jacob deGrom in the eighth to jumpstart the comeback.\n\nTrea Turner, who made a mental mistake on defense, had an RBI double in the ninth.\n\nAnthony Rendon had an RBI hit later in the inning and Zimmerman drove in two with a double as a pinch-hitter.\n\nTurner thought there were two outs when he failed to attempt a double play earlier in the game.\n\nThe Mets (70-68), after a 7-3 win Monday, had won 11 of the previous 17 games this year against Washington.\n\nBut their wild-card chances took a big hit on a night deGrom allowed four runs in eight innings and they hit four homers \u2014 three of them against a struggling Nationals bullpen.\n\nThe comeback overshadowed a rough start for Scherzer, who gave up four runs in six innings/\n\nBut he was upbeat about his third start since coming off the injured list.\n\n\u201cIt was a step forward. It was a good step,\u201d Scherzer said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
