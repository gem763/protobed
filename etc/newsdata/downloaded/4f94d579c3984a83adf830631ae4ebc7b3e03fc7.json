It's a new feeling, isn't it, when it's not Putin and Sobyanin but rather us deciding who will be deputy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's a good feeling. Let's get used to it.\u201d\n\nHe claimed candidates backed by his \u201csmart voting\u201d campaign would have won a majority if not for electoral fraud in four districts where the ruling party won narrow victories. The electoral commission has dismissed most of the hundreds of violations reported by independent observers around Russia.\n\nAlmost two dozen liberal opposition candidates were refused registration on technicalities this summer, prompting tens of thousands to repeatedly take to the streets. More than 2,700 were arrested.\n\nProtesters face off with riot police at a demonstration to demand independent candidates be registered Credit: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty More\n\nAll of United Russia's candidates ran as nominal independents given the party's poor ratings. Mr Navalny called on supporters to cast their ballots for a \u201csmart voting\u201d list of candidates, mostly communists, he believed had the best chance of defeating them.\n\nSeveral well-known Kremlin critics argued the tactic would help legitimise the unfair elections, but one survey suggested the majority of protesters agreed with Mr Navalny.\n\n\u201cWe are here for competition, we would like to choose someone,\u201d teacher Darya Kozyreva, a supporter of barred candidate Ilya Yashin, said after casting her vote for a communist endorsed by the smart voting campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, United Russia also attempted to claim victory in Moscow and around the country. The national party head said its candidates had \u201cknocked out everyone,\u201d winning the governorship in 16 regions and majorities in 12 of 13 regional parliaments.\n\nBut an analysis of preliminary results showed that United Russia had gotten on average 16 per cent fewer votes than last election and was set to lose parliamentary seats in almost all regions. This was despite allegations of ballot-stuffing and attacks on observers in St Petersburg and elsewhere.\n\nThe Khabarovsk region on the Chinese border became the first province where another faction would control the executive and legislative branches after the nationalist Liberal Democrat party won a parliamentary majority thanks largely to a popular governor it managed to elect last year.", "description": "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has claimed a \u201chistoric\u201d victory for his tactical voting campaign after Kremlin-backed candidates lost 13 seats on the Moscow city council following major protests and revelations of corruption.\u00a0 Candidates supported by the ruling United Russia party and mayor", "authors": ["Alec Luhn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9C3EJifyP9skSJ6e4LlFNg--~B/aD0xNTI1O3c9MjQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/c1e6b48790d007328755d69e2cccb176", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
