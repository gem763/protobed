Michael A. Taylor, who hit a solo home run in Game 2 on Saturday at St. Louis, had been in those spots with Robles out.\n\nRobles took swings in the batting cage Sunday and looked strong enough working out for manager Dave Martinez to plug the 22-year-old back in. Martinez didn\u2019t hesitate to say Robles would \u201cget a chance to play\u201d over Taylor when he was 100%.\n\n\u201cHe ran the bases (Sunday) and ran them at full tilt. He looked really good,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe\u2019s raring to go and excited to get back on the field.\u201d\n\nRobles singled in his first at-bat and scored on Adam Eaton\u2019s single in the third inning.\n\nRobles hit .255 with 17 home runs, 65 RBIs and 28 stolen bases during his first full season in the majors. He last played in Game 2 of the NLDS against Los Angeles.\n\nThe Cardinals made one lineup change after putting up just one run on four hits in the first two games. Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez started in right field, with Tommy Edman shifting to third base in place of Matt Carpenter.\n\n\u201cJos\u00e9 has just had good at-bats, putting good swings on the baseball,\u201d manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cJust looking to mix it up a bit, nothing too crazy, obviously. But Jos\u00e9\u2019s earned the opportunity to get in there and create some length in the lineup and in a spot where guys are doing their part in front of him and he can do some damage.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Victor Robles was back in the Nationals' lineup for Game 3 of the NL Championship Series after missing the previous five games with a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/14/bd5e76_nlcs-cardinals-nationals-baseball-70764-washington-nationals-victor-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
