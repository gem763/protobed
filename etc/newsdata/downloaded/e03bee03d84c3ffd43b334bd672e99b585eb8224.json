And on this basis it seemed important that we be able to meet with Javad Zarif to continue converging, operationalizing the conditions under which we can have a de-escalation of tensions and a pause that allows us to negotiate usefully.\"\n\nThe diplomat said a meeting between Iranian and U.S. officials is not on the agenda.\n\n\u201cWe are working in full transparency with the Americans and our European partners,\" said the diplomat.\n\nFrench officials have insisted for weeks that no Iranian officials would be invited to the summit. And the Biarritz airport is currently only open to summit traffic. But the senior French diplomat insisted that Zarif's visit is not part of the summit.\n\n\u201cZarif isn\u2019t invited to the G7, he\u2019s meeting with his counterpart,\" the diplomat said. \"It so happens that Le Drian is in Biarritz and it is useful that he see Zarif on the margins of the G7. But he\u2019s not invited to the G7.\"\n\nThis article has been updated.", "description": "No meeting with US officials planned, spokesman says.", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1163170908-1200x628.jpg"}
