Two of them died at the scene, while the third died later in hospital.\n\nRCMP say the preliminary investigation indicates speed may have been a factor and the driver is facing three counts of dangerous driving causing death. He was released on a promise to appear in Moncton provincial court on Dec. 13.\n\nNo names have been released, but Tamrakar said members of the Indo-Canadian community across the province have pulled together to do whatever they can to help.\n\n'Could barely speak'\n\nAtul Sancheti, president of the Indo-Canada Association of the Greater Moncton Area, said he rushed to the hospital Sunday night after being notified by Tamrakar and welcomed the 25-year-old passenger who had survived into his home.\n\n\"He was released from the hospital and didn't have any place to go and he was still in shock,\" said Sancheti.\n\nThe young man, who was visibly \"shaken up\" and in pain from undisclosed injuries, barely slept, he said. But he had the support of his roommate, who travelled from Saint John to be with him, and his brother-in-law flew in from Toronto on Monday.\n\nTamrakar said the man was still \"devastated\" at that time and \"could barely speak.\"\n\nRCMP continue to seek the public's help with the ongoing investigation into the fatal crash that occurred on Highway 2 eastbound near Moncton on Sunday. (Wade Perry/Twitter)\n\nThe president of the Association of Indo-Canadians Fredericton drove the young man and his brother-in-law to Saint John.\n\nTamrakar transported the driver after he was treated in hospital for a dislocated shoulder and released from police custody.\n\nThe drive back to Saint John was \"very quiet,\" said Tamrakar.\"We were all so sad.\"\n\nHe said he did his best to console the driver. He seemed \"OK,\" but Tamrakar arranged for another member of the society to check in on him later.\n\nRepatriation process started\n\nSancheti, who has been in contact with the victims' families in India, said they are grieving the tragic loss. He has been working with the funeral home to ensure all the required paperwork is sent to the Indian consulate in Toronto, which is arranging for repatriation.\n\nRCMP Sgt. Patrick Tardif said the three autopsies have been completed and he doesn't expect any delays in getting the bodies home to their families.\n\nThe investigation into the crash, which closed a section of the highway for more than 12 hours, is ongoing. Tardif said it could take another few weeks to complete the interviews with witnesses and review the accident reconstructionist's report.\n\nAnyone with information about the crash or who may have seen the vehicle, a 2018 silver coloured four-door Subaru Outback with New Brunswick licence NDZ 829, travelling on the highway prior to the crash is asked to contact Southeast District RCMP at 506-387-2222.\n\nNBCC officials declined an interview Tuesday.\n\n\"At this time, our thoughts are with the families and friends of those who lost their lives in this tragic accident,\" said spokesperson Tanya Greer.", "description": "A day of sightseeing in Moncton for five young men from India ended in tragedy Sunday, with three of them dead and the driver facing possible charges.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5269377.1567553798!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/amit-tamrakar-president-of-the-indo-canadian-society-of-saint-john.jpg"}
