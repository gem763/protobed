Biden. An intelligence community whistleblower had filed a formal complaint after becoming aware of the phone call and how it was handled, and Mrs. Pelosi agreed to launch an impeachment investigation after the White House tried to keep it from Congress.\n\nMr. Maher, 63, has regularly hammered Mr. Trump on his show since he started running for office, and he has repeatedly asserted that the president will not voluntarily leave the White House once his administration should be over.\n\n\u201cOnce fascists get power, they don\u2019t give it up. You\u2019ve got President Trump for life,\u201d Mr. Maher said on his show in 2016.\n\n\u201cI absolutely think he will not leave,\u201d Mr. Maher reiterated earlier this year.\n\nAmericans are roughly split in half with respect to impeaching Mr. Trump, according to recent polling. The results of NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist survey released Friday found that 49% of respondents approve of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, compared to 46% who disapprove.\n\nMore than 220 Democratic members of the House of Representatives, the vast majority of the caucus, have stated their support for moving forward with impeachment proceedings, meanwhile.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
