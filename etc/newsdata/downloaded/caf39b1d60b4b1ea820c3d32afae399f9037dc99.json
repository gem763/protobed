If, as expected, the majority vote in favour of the new bill, Greeks will have the right to decide their own gender identity at the age of 15.\n\nAnna Apergi, the Director of a transgender support association, suggested prostitution one of very few possible jobs for transgender people.\n\n\u201cOpening a bank account, picking up a parcel from the post office, renting a house. All this seems rather simple to most people but for us, transgender people, it is a nightmare. The hardest of all, is to find a job in the daylight.\u201d\n\nDespite being a transgender woman, legally Anna must comply with what is written on her identity card, which has a male name.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic moment. For so many years, transgender people were in the dark. With this bill, it\u2019s no longer the case. It\u2019s important, cause finally they state recognises our existence.\u201d\n\nThe Orthodox Church is firmly opposed to the proposed bill and has criticised the House Speaker who has said there should be separation of Church and State in the highly religious country.\n\nEuronews reporter, Apostolos Staikos, adds:\n\n\u201cPrejudice, racism, marginalisation. For decades, this has been the everyday life of transgender people in Greece. Some political parties and the Church strongly disagree with the bill. But for the transgender community, this is a first, big step leading to a better life.\u201d", "description": "Transgender identity is debated in the Greek parliament.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/392364/1000x563_392364.jpg", "published_at": "2017-10-09"}
