Not to say that there's anything wrong with that. It is a lovely jumper, just don't be surprised if you have a few curious glances whilst out shopping or taking tea.\"\n\nHaving initially overlooked the rude resemblance, FatFace took the reviews in its stride and issued the perfect response to the funny feedback.\n\n(Image: FatFace)\n\nReplying to the online comments, the retailer said: \"We've got to be honest, we feel like a bit of a melon... But whilst booby bunting wasn't quite the look our designers were going for, we\u2019re embracing it.\n\n\"That\u2019s why we\u2019re grabbing life by the boobs and donating 10% from the sale of this jumper to breast cancer awareness charity, CoppaFeel!\"\n\nThe product's online description has also been changed to 'Say hello to the jumper everyone is talking about' and repeats the pledge to donate a chunk of sales to charity.\n\nPeople were loving the brand's quick thinking, with one Twitter user saying: \"Well done FatFace!
