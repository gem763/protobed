It is an entity created as part of the controversial Algonquins of Ontario land claim that has been criticized by Algonquin First Nations in Quebec who question its legitimacy.\n\nSerr\u00e9 is on a voters' list drafted in 2015 to determine who could vote for the ratification of an agreement-in-principle. According to the document, his root ancestor is Marie Mitewamewkwe.\n\nAlso known as Marie Miteouamigoukoue and Marie Miteouamegoukwe, Mitewamewkwe is believed to be an Algonquin woman born circa 1631, according to Leroux's book. She died in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Que., on Jan. 8, 1699.\n\n\"[Mitewamewkwe] is likely the second-most well-known Indigenous ancestor in French-descendant genealogical circles today,\" wrote Leroux in his book.\n\nShe is cited as a root ancestor for people claiming to be M\u00e9tis in Quebec, Algonquin in Ontario and Abenaki in New Hampshire, he wrote.\n\nSerr\u00e9 told CBC News that he has Algonquin ancestry through four lines on his father's side and and at least one on his mother's side, but admits only one link is documented and the rest are part of family lore.\n\n\"The Catholic Church literally erased their past in the late 1850s and this is well documented,\" said Serr\u00e9. \"The Catholic Church would take kids from the reserves and so my two great-great-grandmothers were taken away.\"\n\nSerr\u00e9 said his paternal great-great-grandmother was a woman named Marie Metamakin (Serr\u00e9's spelling) who was a Weskarini Algonquin born in Trois Rivi\u00e8res, Que.\n\n\"Four generations, my Algonquin ancestry is,\" he said. \"That we could prove.\"\n\nDarryl Leroux is an associate professor at Saint Mary's University in Halifax. (CBC)\n\nSerr\u00e9 said he and his family have always felt Indigenous at their core.\n\n\"Growing up we considered ourselves more on the M\u00e9tis side \u2026 my grandfather's brothers and sisters lived off the land \u2026 and clearly if you look at pictures, you see a lot of resemblance to my great-great-grandmother,\" said Serr\u00e9.\n\n\"All my ancestry on all sides lived very poor, lived off the land.\"\n\nSerr\u00e9 said the documented connection runs through his father, Gaetan Serr\u00e9, his father's mother, Jeanne Aubin, and her mother, Marie Victoire Octavi Trudel. Serr\u00e9 said Trudel's mother was Marie Metamakin.\n\nCBC News took Serr\u00e9's lineage to independent Montreal-based genealogical researcher Dominique Ritchot. Richot followed the line and found that Trudel's mother was a woman named Josaphine Barette, whose parents were Vital Barette and Marcelline Lareau, who were married on Feb. 9, 1858, in Napierville, Que.\n\nCBC News approached Serr\u00e9 with Ritchot's findings last week. He responded Tuesday with a short statement.\n\n\"I am proud of my heritage as a citizen of the Algonquin First Nation in Mattawa-North Bay,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Liberal Party deferred questions to Serr\u00e9.\n\nThe Acadian-M\u00e9tis controversy\n\nIn a now-deleted section of Amanda Kistindey's profile on the Green Party's website, she identified as an Acadian-M\u00e9tis with \"strong ancestral heritage\" which has shaped her advocacy.\n\nLeroux said her claim as Acadian-M\u00e9tis also likely hinges on a more than three-century-old ancestor. Acadian-M\u00e9tis claims first surfaced in 1999 and in a 2001 court case, he said.\n\n\"It's an identity appropriation \u2026 this is very insidious because it's much harder to call out,\" he said. \"It's wrong because those same individuals are using this anti-colonial or de-colonial language to assert these identities.\"\n\nA screengrab of Amanda Kistindey's candidate profile on the Green Party website before it was changed. (CBC)\n\nIn an email to CBC News, Kistindey said that while she's never grown up on reserve or \"even really been immersed in the culture,\" she is proud of her ancestral heritage.\n\nWhile Kistindey did not respond to followup questions, the Green Party said in a statement it \"does not verify the background of our candidates who self-identify as Indigenous.\"\n\nThe statement said the party believes individual Indigenous nations and communities should have the authority to decide who is Indigenous, \"not Ottawa.\"\n\n'An attack on sovereignty'\n\nAccording to Leroux, one of the most dangerous manifestations of what he terms \"identity appropriation\" arises when groups form and claim some type of Indigenous ancestry in an effort to stop real Indigenous communities from asserting their rights.\n\n\"A number of white people used ancestors in the past to stop a territorial claim,\" said Leroux. \"To me, it's always an attack on sovereignty.\"\n\nLeroux devotes a chapter in his book to Quebec's M\u00e9tis Nation of the Rising Sun. According to Leroux, it's the largest self-identifying M\u00e9tis organization in the province, counting between 16,000 and 20,000 people as members.\n\nLeroux writes in his book that the Rising Sun group sprouted from opposition in 2006 to an agreement between the Mi'kmaq community of Gesgapegiag and the Quebec government over territorial hunting and fishing rights in the Gasp\u00e9 region.\n\nThe group has also looked to the Quebec courts for recognition as a constitutional rights-bearing M\u00e9tis community to hunt and fish. In August, the Supreme Court of Canada denied their case's application to leave for appeal.\n\nGreen Party candidate Jocelyn Rioux says on his candidate profile that he is the \"Aboriginal Chief for the Environment\" for the Rising Sun band council.\n\nRioux told CBC News via email that on his mother's side of the family, his ancestors are Huron-Wendat from Wendake, Que.\n\n\"I asked for a more accurate genealogy with the birth and marriage certificates. In my family, I've never asked myself whether I'm Indigenous, any more than African, Chinese or whatever,\" he said.\n\nJocelyn Rioux is a Green Party candidate in the Quebec riding of Rimouski-Neigette-T\u00e9miscouata-Les Basques. (www.jocelynrioux.ca)\n\nWhen asked why he identifies as M\u00e9tis rather than Huron-Wendat, he said it's because his family is still searching for his father's ancestry and that his mother's lineage isn't recognized under the Indian Act.\n\n\"It's a form of racism,\" said Rioux. \"But our nation did detailed genealogy studies and acknowledged many of our members could be recognized as First Nations.\"\n\nAs for Leroux's criticism, Rioux copied and pasted a section of the M\u00e9tis Nation of the Rising Sun's website on their history that states the presence of M\u00e9tis in the Gasp\u00e9sie dates back to 1760.\n\n\"I remember when I was young being tormented by other children for being Indigenous, and now it's adults who deny our identity. I imagine that the genocide continues to work in silence and true reconciliation is not here,\" he said.\n\nEastern M\u00e9tis or Mi'kmaq?\n\nIn an interview with CBC Nova Scotia earlier this month, Conservative candidate George Canyon said he identified as a member of the Eastern Woodlands M\u00e9tis Nation.\n\nWhen CBC Indigenous contacted the Conservative Party about Canyon's Indigenous identity, it sent a statement that said Canyon was \"proud of his Mi'kmaq heritage, but is not status.\"\n\nGeorge Canyon is the Conservative candidate for Central Nova in Nova Scotia. (Kiah Welsh)\n\nLeroux said the Eastern Woodlands M\u00e9tis Nation is \"perhaps the most fraudulent Acadian-M\u00e9tis organization\" and that Canyon is falsely claiming to be Indigenous.\n\nNeither the Eastern Woodlands M\u00e9tis Nation nor the M\u00e9tis Nation of the Rising Sun is recognized by the M\u00e9tis National Council (MNC).\n\nLast year, the MNC signed a memorandum of understanding with the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq Chiefs to educate the public about the \"legitimate M\u00e9tis Nation and Mi'kmaq issues.\"\n\nWill Goodon, housing minister for Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation, said unless a candidate has roots to the M\u00e9tis Nation in Western Canada, they are not M\u00e9tis.\n\n\"There is only one M\u00e9tis Nation,\" he said. \"It's absolutely clear, cut and dry. The Acadian people are Acadian people and they're not M\u00e9tis. And if your relations are Mi'kmaq, why don't you want to be Mi'kmaq?\"\n\nWill Goodon, with the Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation, says people claiming M\u00e9tis identity via a long-ago First Nations ancestor is a growing problem. (Lenard Monkman/CBC)\n\nIt's a growing problem that people think having a mixture of Indigenous and non-Indigenous ancestry makes a person M\u00e9tis, he said.\n\n\"It's not a catch-all phrase for people who have some Indigenous ancestry going back five, 10, 12 generations,\" said Goodon. \"They can be who they are, but they're not us.\"", "description": "The author of a new book, Distorted Descent:\u00a0White Claims to Indigenous Identity, says several federal election candidates identifying as Indigenous are basing their claims on a long-ago ancestor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5315535.1570658454!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/4-candidate-composite.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
