Several allies of the president coming to his defense today, amid increasing pressure over the phone call with the president of Ukraine. But Democrats say the investigation into whether the president abused his power is moving forward. And quickly. Tonight, Adam Schiff has confirmed the whistle-blower is ready to testify. The controversy sets up what could be a defining week for president trump and the race for the white house. Here's David Wright. Reporter: Today the president's defenders fanned out. Salem witch trials have more due process than this. Reporter: Lashing out at the impeachment inquiry. The president of the united States is the whistle-blower. And this individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government. Reporter: This weekend the president himself tweeted a defiant white house video, blasting the Democrats. They're trying to stop me because I'm fighting for you. And I'll never let that happen. We're moving forward with all speed and that's really what's important here. Reporter: One of the Democrats leading the congressional hearings, house intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff, says the whistle-blower who filed the initial complaint against the president is ready to testify, with precautions taken to protect that person's identity. So when do you expect to hear from the whistle-blower? Very soon. You know, it will depend probably more on how quickly the director of national intelligence can complete the security clearance process for the whistle-blower's lawyers but we're ready to hear from the whistle-blower as soon as that is done. Reporter: Today the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, named more than 30 times in the whistle-blower report, suggested he'll only cooperate with the congressional inquiry if the president says he can. Will you cooperate with the house intelligence committee? I wouldn't cooperate with Adam Schiff. If they put a neutral person in, who hasn't pre-judged the case, if they put someone in, a Democrat who hasn't expressed an opinion yet. So that's your answer, you're not going to cooperate? I didn't say that. I said I will consider it. You said you wouldn't do it. You won't cooperate with Adam Schiff. I said I will consider it. I have to be guided by my client. Reporter: A new ABC news/ipsos poll suggests that, for now, the public is giving congress the benefit of the asked how serious a problem is the allegation that trump encouraged the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son in that July phone call, 43% said \"Very serious.\" 20% said \"Somewhat serious.\" Former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said he's deeply concerned by the phone call. It's a bad day and a bad week for the president and this country if he's asking for political dirt on an opponent. Reporter: Tonight, house speaker Nancy Pelosi tells \"60 minutes\" the call is just part of the investigation. It is not just what happens in the call, it's part of the sequencing of events as well. You withdraw a couple hundred million dollars' worth of assistance to a country and then a couple of days later say, by the way, can you help me with my campaign, in other words, there's a sequencing there. David, we heard Adam Schiff in your report, the committee will move forward quickly. Congress is in a two-week recess, but the committee is still calling witnesses? Reporter: It is. And at a quick pace. They expect to hear from the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, and the former U.N. Special envoy to Ukraine. And they'll hear from the inspector general who called the complaint credible and of urgent concern. That testimony will likely be taken behind closed doors.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "A new ABC News/Ipsos poll finds 43% of the public think Trump's Ukraine phone call is a", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/WNT/190929_wn_wright_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
