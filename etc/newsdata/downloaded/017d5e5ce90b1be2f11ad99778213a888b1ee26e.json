To celebrate that time, they decided to re-record some of those tracks and compile them for the new album, Hey, I'm Just Like You. On this week's New Music Friday, we look at the youthful melodrama behind those songs and what Tegan and Sara found to feel good about. We also spin the reliably infectious new album from The New Pornographers, a lost record from John Coltrane, Sturgill Simpson's scuzzy concept album Sound & Fury, Laurie Anderson's deep dive into the Tibetan Book of the Dead and more.
