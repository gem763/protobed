Iran has also denied any involvement.\n\nBut if Iran was responsible for the attack it would fall in line with a cycle of events that in recent months as Tehran seeks relief from crippling US sanctions under the Trump administration's \"maximum pressure\" campaign.\n\nIran has been battling Saudi Arabia for regional supremacy and has reacted to the Trump administration's sanctions by seizing oil tankers in the region as the US has simultaneously accused it of using naval mines to sabotage tankers. But none of this has convinced Trump to ease up on sanctions. The Saudi attack, by contrast, sent shockwaves through global energy markets.\n\nAn expert said Iran may be simply trying to spike oil prices to raise pressure on the US to ease the sanctions and to punish the Saudis for supporting the US's campaign against Iran.\n\n'Iran is trying to raise the costs for the US and its partners for the economic pressure it's facing.'\n\n\"Assessments are still in the works, and it's important not to rush to judgment without international scrutiny. At this point, however, it does appear that Iran is implicated in the attack. If this is the case, it would certainly fit a pattern we've seen over the summer where Iran is trying to raise the costs for the US and its partners for the economic pressure it's facing, particularly the US sanctions that are significantly curtailing its oil exports,\" Dalia Dassa Kaye, a top Middle East expert at the RAND Corporation, told Insider.\n\nAccording to some reports, drones and more than 20 cruise missiles struck the Saudi oil facilities with precision \u2014 the kind of attack few insurgencies are likely to be able to mount.\n\n\"All signs point to Iranian responsibility,\" Michael Singh, a former senior director for Middle East affairs on the National Security Council under former President George W. Bush who's now at The Washington Institute.\n\n\"This is not merely because US officials seem to have intelligence indicating that this is so. The scale and precision of the attack suggests that a state, rather than one of the Middle East's many non-state militias, is behind it,\" Singh said. \"And few states if any besides Iran would have both the capability and motivation to mount an attack on Saudi oil production.\"\n\nSingh said Iran's denial of responsibility \"tells us little\" and characterized it as par for the course from a country that \"wants to inflict pain but avoid a broader conflict.\"\n\nIran wants leverage\n\nThe incident in Saudi Arabia occurs in the broader context of an impasse between the US and Iran over crippling economic sanctions that Tehran is desperate to find relief from. Since President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement \u2014 designed to keep them from building nuclear weapons \u2014 and reimposed sanctions, US-Iran relations have deteriorated and reached a boiling point this summer.\n\nThe US has sought to hit Iran where it hurts with sanctions designed to choke of the oil revenue that is its primary source of income; they went into full effect in May. Some countries, including China, have still taken oil from Iranian tankers and risked economic penalties from the US.\n\nRead more: Iran could take advantage of Trump's wishy-washy response to the Saudi oil field attacks\n\nThere's also another piece to this: Saudi Arabia and Iran have been at odds for decades, and are currently engaged in a proxy war in Yemen. Iran is backing the Houthi rebels in the war, who are fighting against the Saudi-led coalition.\n\nIn this context, there are many reasons for Iran to target the Saudi oil industry, given the kingdom is one of their top adversaries and a close partner of the US. Not to mention, Iran has already been blamed for oil tanker attacks in the region and has also been involved in the seizure of oil tankers in recent months \u2014 including on Monday.\n\nSingh told Insider there are at least four reasons why Iran would want to conduct an attack like this:\n\n\"First, and quite simply, to raise oil prices, which is not an insignificant consideration given the sharp reduction in the volume of Iran's oil exports.\" \"Second, to punish Saudi Arabia for its participation in the US 'maximum pressure' campaign.\" \"Third, to expose and widen a gap between the US and its regional allies by demonstrating American reluctance to act to defend its partners.\" \"And fourth, to generate pressure on the United States to relax its sanctions against Iran by stoking a sense of crisis.\"\n\n\"Iran's months-long campaign of regional escalation \u2014 attacks on tankers, pipelines, and now the Abqaiq facility \u2014 is linked to its nuclear escalation, in that it sees both areas as points of leverage against the US and our allies, and believes we will be hard-pressed to respond,\" Singh added.\n\n'If Iran is in the mindset it has nothing to lose, we can expect more provocations.'\n\nAn attack on major oil facilities impacting the global oil supply is a much bigger deal than tanker attacks and seizures, and could signal that more attacks of this magnitude are on the horizon as Iran seeks leverage in the stalemate with the US and other Western powers over sanctions and the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nIran has taken steps away from the deal over the past few months, raising anxiety among European countries scrambling to save the landmark agreement.\n\n\"This attack is particularly brazen, especially if it was launched directly from Iran rather than through regional proxies,\" Kaye said. \"But it's not terribly surprising given the escalation cycle we've seen since the US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement and the maximum pressure campaign.\"\n\n\"If Iran is in the mindset it has nothing to lose, we can expect more provocations, unfortunately,\" Kaye added. \"Presumably, Iranian leaders believe these types of activities can gain them leverage in the future, but it's a risky gambit when their actions are threatening global stability.\"", "description": "If Iran was responsible for the shocking attack, it falls in line with a pattern of dangerous escalations to harm the US for its harsh sanctions.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d81031a2e22af49080e1e02-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
