USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Washington Nationals' path to winning Game 5 of the World Series may look a little different now with Joe Ross starting in place of the injured Max Scherzer. But there's still a path.\n\nWith their ace sidelined by severe muscle spasms in his back and neck, the Nationals will turn to Ross \u2013 who pitched two scoreless innings against the Astros on Friday in Game 3.\n\nRoss probably won't go very deep into the game, working on just one day's rest.\n\n\"We're going to let him go as much as he can go,\" Nationals manager Dave Martinez said.\n\nHowever, the Nationals' two best relievers \u2013 Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson \u2013 have not pitched since Game 1 last Tuesday in Houston.\n\nIn putting together a possible game plan, Washington manager Dave Martinez's wish list probably includes two or three innings from Ross up front, and two each from Doolittle and Hudson at the back.\n\nThe key to pulling it off will be how Martinez deploys his bullpen for the innings in between.\n\nHe won't be able to work any platoon advantage because Doolittle and Game 4 starter Patrick Corbin (who's unavailable for Game 5) are the only left-handers on the World Series roster.\n\nRookie Tanner Rainey threw 13 pitches last night in Game 4. He figures to be in the mix for the middle innings when the Astros have a succession of right-handed hitters. He allowed a .526 OPS to them during the regular season, as opposed to a .942 OPS against left-handed batters.\n\nThe Nats will likely look to have Fernando Rodney to face left-handed batters because his signature changeup is effective against hitters on both sides of the plate. But Rodney threw 25 pitches in Game 4 and 15 in Game 3, so he may be limited to just one or two batters.\n\nWander Suero (nine pitches in Game 3, five in Game 4) will likely have to pitch for a third consecutive day.\n\nThe wild card in the mix is the Nats' starter in Game 3, Anibal Sanchez. Martinez said Sanchez will be available to pitch, if needed, on one day's rest -- probably for just an inning.\n\nOffensive benefit\n\nBecause the Nationals have leaned so heavily on their starting pitchers this postseason, they haven't needed a fully stocked bullpen. Their World Series roster has 14 position players and 11 pitchers.\n\nThat will give Martinez a variety of pinch-hitting options whenever the pitcher's spot comes around in the batting order. Facing Astros ace Gerrit Cole, the Nationals can't afford to give away outs. So don't expect a Nationals pitcher to step into the batter's box in Game 5 \u2013 unless the Nationals have the lead.\n\nWashington's pinch-hitters produced a .743 OPS during the regular season, the fourth-best figure in the National League. Their .337 on-base percentage was the league's second-best.\n\nIf they can keep the game close, those extra plate appearances by non-pitchers could be important.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nOne last thing to consider in the overall scope of the series: The Nationals need to win two of the final three games, no matter how they come.\n\nEven if they lose Game 5, they'll have a travel day for their bullpen to recover. And they have Stephen Strasburg waiting in the wings to start Game 6.\n\nWinning Strasburg's start was essential to their title hopes once they lost Game 4. So that part of the plan hasn't changed. The light at the end of the proverbial tunnel is if Scherzer can recover in time to start a potential Game 7.\n\nIf he can, then the duo of Strasburg and Scherzer could still lead the Nationals to their first World Series title \u2013 just in a different order than the Nats originally envisioned.", "description": "Despite not having ace Max Scherzer on the mound in Game 5, all is not lost for the Washington Nationals.", "authors": ["Steve Gardner", "Published P.M.
