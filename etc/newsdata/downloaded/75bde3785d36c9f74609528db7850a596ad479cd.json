If Mr. Trump had a shred of evidence against Mr. Biden or any legitimate governmental objective in view, he would have directed the Justice Department or State Department to work directly with Ukraine.\n\nHolding up military assistance to coerce Ukraine into investigating Mr. Biden is itself a grave, impeachable abuse of power if done for personal and political reasons. The inspector general made a reference to a promise to a foreign leader in the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint, though we don\u2019t yet know what it was. If Mr. Trump promised to reward Ukraine with military aid for finding dirt on Mr. Biden, that could constitute bribery, a separate constitutional ground for impeachment.\n\nIt\u2019s a violation of campaign finance law to solicit campaign help from a foreign country, as Mr. Trump knows well from the Russia collusion investigation. It\u2019s also Nixonian.", "description": "", "authors": ["Elizabeth Holtzman", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Impeachment-Trump-Watergate.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
