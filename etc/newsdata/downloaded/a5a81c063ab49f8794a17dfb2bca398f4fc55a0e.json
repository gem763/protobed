(ABC News) More\n\nThe family previously called for a meeting with Sacoolas in England, an unlikely occurrence after the woman fled the country and claimed diplomatic immunity.\n\nCharles said she \"initially\" thought the meeting was being held to sweep her son's death under the rug.\n\n(MORE: Family of UK teen killed in crash with US diplomat's wife says apology 'not strong enough')\n\n\"I did think they were trying to do that -- certainly by having Mrs. Sacoolas there,\" she told the Press Association. \"I think maybe they were thinking that would be enough for us. We're seven weeks on and it's just not enough.\"\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on Trump to intervene in the case after it created an uproar there after the diplomat's wife left the country apparently claiming diplomatic immunity.\n\nPHOTO: President Donald Trump speaks during a 'Keep America Great' rally at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minn. on Oct. 10, 2019.

There\u2019s tremendous anger over it. It\u2019s a terrible incident. There\u2019s tremendous anger, and I understand the anger from the other side very much,\u201d Trump said.\n\nPHOTO: RAF Croughton airbase where Harry Dunn died on Aug. 27 when riding his motorcycle from his home, in Northamptonshire, Britain a memorial is seen on Oct. 15, 2019.

And, frankly, a lot of Americans feel the same way. We have -- I was telling Boris, we have a lot of Americans that, you know, they side on the fact that, you know, you have two wonderful parents that lost their son, and the woman was driving on the wrong side of the road. And that can happen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen you get used to driving on our system and then you\u2019re all of a sudden in the other system, where you\u2019re driving -- it happens.\u201d\n\nABC News' Josh Hoyos and Morgan Winsor contributed to this report.", "description": "The family of Harry Dunn, a British teenager killed when the wife of an American diplomat crashed into his motorcycle in August, visited the White House Tuesday for a meeting with President Donald Trump, according to the White House.
