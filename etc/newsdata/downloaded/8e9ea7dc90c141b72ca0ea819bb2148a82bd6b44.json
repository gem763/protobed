Maybe.\n\nAfter a weekend of rumors, Tiffany & Co. released a statement saying that its higher-ups have \u201creceived an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from LVMH Moet Hennessy\u2014Louis Vuitton to acquire Tiffany for $120 per share in cash.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the offer would set LVMH back $14.5 billion\u2014the most it\u2019s ever paid for a company. The storied jewelry brand board\u2019s of directors will review the offer, and no official decision has been made.\n\nIn engagement ring parlance, the suggested deal is no \u201cShe said yes!\u201d Higher-ups at the jewelry retailer will take their time to negotiate. But a sale would be the beginning of a new era for the 182-year-old Tiffany and Co., and yet another example of LVMH gobbling up another prestige property.\n\nJust this year, the French fashion house launched Fenty, a label designed by the singer Rihanna. In 2017, CEO Bernard Arnault acquired Dior in a deal worth $13.1 billion; it also owns big names like Sephora, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, and Louis Vuitton.\n\nRepresentatives for Tiffany and Co. directed The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment to a press release the brand already published. LVMH did not respond to an inquiry.\n\nTiffany has held an indelible stamp on the imagination of many shoppers, partly due to its recognition as a cultural touchstone. The Fifth Avenue flagship served as inspiration for Truman Capote novella Breakfast at Tiffany's (and subsequent legendary Audrey Hepburn film), and Marilyn Monroe sang about the store in \u201cDiamonds Are a Girl\u2019s Best Friend.\u201d It is the namesake of Tiffany Trump, whose father Donald\u2019s most famous property rests adjacent to the store.\n\nBut such endorsements have proved not enough to save the struggling jeweler, which reported disappointing sales last holiday season, falling one percent from 2017. This year, the brand seems almost militant in publicizing its seasonal offerings, like its much ballyhooed $112,000 advent calendar.\n\n\u201c Existing brands and retailers need to evolve and understand how to do so efficiently, which for many means joining forces with others or becoming part of a larger group. There\u2019s strength in numbers \u201d\n\nExperts told The Daily Beast the LVMH safety net could help resuscitate Tiffany\u2019s, and that the famously cliquey fashion world tends to favor when brands consolidate.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s landscape is increasingly crowded and challenging,\u201d said Alexis DeSalva , a senior research analyst at the market insight firm Mintel. \u201cExisting brands and retailers need to evolve and understand how to do so efficiently, which for many means joining forces with others or becoming part of a larger group. There\u2019s strength in numbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cFashion conglomerates wield the power, as long as they are relevant,\u201d said Roseanne Morrison, fashion director of retail strategist company The Doneger Group. \u201cIt is about the survival of the fittest, especially as conglomerates recognize true artists and buy into their aesthetic. Investment trumps all.\u201d\n\nTiffany\u2019s seems to prioritize its heritage and instant name recognition over innovation. Though this year the brand made a bid for younger, cooler customers (who still can afford five-figure diamonds), through its collaboration with Lady Gaga, executives have been hesitant to accept that their industry is changing.\n\nThis year, Tiffany\u2019s addressed the need to responsibly source all diamonds but stopped short at offering lab-grown options, which are becoming increasingly popular for millennials desiring ethical (and cheap) engagement rings.\n\nAndy Hart, the brand\u2019s senior vice president of diamond and jewelry supply, told the trade magazine JCK that, \u201cOur position is lab-grown diamonds are not luxury material. We don\u2019t see a role for them in a luxury brand.\u201d Perhaps LVMH, which exists both to inspire change and make money, could push designers to reconsider.\n\n\u201cCustomers can identify brands and certainly have preferred brands, but that\u2019s generally as deep as consideration goes when making shopping decisions,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cWhether or not a brand was purchased by another company doesn\u2019t really matter when it comes down to it.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Shobert, vice president of marketing and digital strategy for retail insight company StyleSage, called marriage the \u201cperfect analogy\u201d for any potential acquisition.\n\n\u201cOn its own, Tiffany & Co. has accomplished a lot,\u201d Shobert said. \u201cBut because it\u2019s independent, it also has fewer resources to achieve its full digital and physical retail potential, as well as defend itself during an economic downturn. It has also had some wobbles in recent years, with fewer people buying engagement rings, trying to rebalance its high-low portfolio, and undergoing some rebranding.\u201d\n\nLVMH could help restore Tiffany\u2019s cachet and stabilize its bottom line, and in the process it could gain footing in the jewelry market, which Shobert called \u201carguably the weakest of all [LVMH] verticals.\u201d\n\n\u201c Tiffany\u2019s is about one-third the size of Louis Vuitton. Think about eating something that\u2019s one-third the size of your mass \u201d\n\nAlong with that, Tiffany\u2019s dowry of sorts contains its popularity in China and footprint of stores in the United States, which are no doubt attractive to a Paris-based powerhouse.\n\nEven though Tiffany\u2019s can stand to gain some protection, and maybe a little reputation rehab from LVMH, it delivers quite a bit of value to the company's portfolio.\n\n\u201cThis is a big thing for LVMH to acquire,\u201d Charles Beckwith, host of American Fashion Podcast, said. \u201cTiffany\u2019s is about one-third the size of Louis Vuitton. Think about eating something that\u2019s one-third the size of your mass.\u201d\n\nThe deal is still pending, but consider this news your official save the date for one very expensive wedding.", "description": "LVMH may be about to buy Tiffany & Co. for an estimated $14.5 billion.
