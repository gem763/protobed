At its 10th anniversary celebration this evening, the company unveiled a huge slate of upcoming games.\n\nThere are multiple League spinoffs, including a fighting game, digital card game, and animated series. There\u2019s also a mysterious, in-the-works shooter codenamed \u201cProject A\u201d that takes place in a brand-new universe. If the first 10 years of Riot were defined almost entirely by a single game, it looks like the next decade will be about building on that foundation.\n\n\u201cIt feels awesome,\u201d Riot co-founder Marc Merrill tells The Verge of the company\u2019s new lineup announcement. \u201cIt is a really exciting time as a developer when you\u2019ve been working on things for, in many cases, years, to finally start to expose those things to the rest of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a really exciting time as a developer.\u201d\n\nOf course, following up a game like League is an intimidating task. Despite its age, it still ranks among the most popular titles in the world, with an estimated 8 million daily players and vibrant professional leagues spanning multiple continents. That long-term success will inevitably put a lot of pressure on any follow-up game, but Merrill says that isn\u2019t necessarily the reason it took so long to announce Riot\u2019s next title.\n\n\u201cRiot is probably the biggest game company ever to only have one game,\u201d he explains. \u201cI think that there are very valid ways to look at that and critique it. On the flip side, I think there are very valid ways to talk about why that focus actually may be part of the secret sauce of the company\u2019s success.\u201d\n\nAccording to Merrill, the scale of League allowed the company to attract new people, which in turn made it possible to form new teams around specific projects. \u201cIn order to deliver and create incredible games, you need the best people, you need the best teams,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t do that overnight.\u201d\n\nAlong those same lines, the ongoing success of League gave the company the luxury of time. They didn\u2019t have to rush out a new game, but instead could figure out what made sense to tackle next. Merrill says that Riot\u2019s R&D department has explored many different ideas, the majority of which don\u2019t make it to the actual production phase.\n\n\u201cRiot is only going to do a few big games over time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt only makes sense to do something if we\u2019re confident that we can elevate the experience for players,\u201d he says. \u201cRiot is only going to do a few big games over time, because we want players to know what to expect from Riot in terms of commitment: quality of service, great IP, really high-quality gameplay.\u201d (He notes that smaller projects like animated shorts were a way to \u201cbuild the muscle\u201d for these more ambitious ventures.)\n\nOne of the more surprising announcements Riot made was the aforementioned \u201cProject A.\u201d Every other title the company spoke about today was related in some way to League, whether it\u2019s a card game set in the same fantasy universe or a 2D fighter starring familiar characters. But \u201cProject A\u201d goes in a different direction: it\u2019s a tactical shooter set in a brand-new universe. Merrill says the reason for this is simple: the world of League \u2014 in particular the silhouettes of its characters \u2014 wouldn\u2019t work for that kind of shooter experience.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the [intellectual property] needs to support the gameplay,\u201d Merrill says. \u201cIn many cases, League of Legends really enhances a particular game. We think that\u2019s true in Legends of Runeterra, we think that will be true in \u2018Project L.\u2019 With a super competitive tactical shooter, that has incredibly tight gunplay, where the skill ceiling is kind of an infinite curve, League IP would actually do a disservice to that game.\u201d\n\nAccording to Merrill, it also made sense to announce a group of games, rather than one title that would have the burden of being the game to follow up League of Legends. As the company looks toward its next decade, this was a chance to show a new direction for Riot, one that aims to build off of the success of League in a variety of ways. \u201cWe think that when people see it all together, rather than one in isolation, they\u2019re going to understand it more,\u201d says Merrill.", "description": "Riot announced a slew of new games today, including League of Legends: Wild Rift, Legends of Runeterra, and multiple secret projects.
