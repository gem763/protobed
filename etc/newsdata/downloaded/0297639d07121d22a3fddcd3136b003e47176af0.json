It includes more than 200 newly restored and some never-before-published photographs, as well as untold stories from filmmakers and exhibitors.\n\n\u201cMae West had this reputation countrywide as being this woman who worked nights in New York and had a very scandalous, very sexual life,\u201d author Mark A. Vieira told Fox News. \u201cPeople in polite society did not use the word \u2018sex.\u2019 The community standards were very, very different.\u201d\n\nBefore West tantalized moviegoers, she had long sparked plenty of controversies.\n\nThe New York Times previously reported her play \u201cSex\u201d opened in New York in 1926 in front of a full house despite the refusal of local newspapers to carry advertisements for it.\n\nSoon after, the blonde bombshell was targeted by the Society for the Suppression of Voice. Not only was West and members of the cast arrested in the theater, but she was also found guilty of a performance that \u201ctended to correct the morals of youth and others.\u201d The outlet shared West was fined $500 and sentenced to 10 days in prison.\n\nIn 1928, the cast of her play \u201cThe Pleasure Man\u201d was arrested onstage during the first performance, the outlet revealed. After a second raid two days later, West chose not to reopen it. The Los Angeles Times reported Paramount Pictures, desperate to make a major buck, offered West $5,000-a-week to star in 1932\u2019s \u201cNight After Night.\u201d\n\nAlthough she only had four scenes, the studio was impressed and bought her 1928 play \u201cDiamond Lil\u201d for her first leading screen role. The title was ultimately changed to \u201cShe Done Him Wrong.\u201d\n\nSTRUGGLED TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY IN HOLLYWOOD, SAYS FILM EXPERT\n\n\u201c[\u2018She Done Him Wrong\u2019] was a lightning rod,\u201d said Vieira. \u201cThe idea that Mae West could come to Hollywood and make films \u2014 that was an issue. And the posters\u2026 they emphasized her breasts tremendously. The idea of Mae West making films and the advertisement were a problem.\u201d\n\nNot only did West persevere, but she chose a \u201csensational-looking young man,\u201d an unknown actor named Cary Grant, to star alongside her. The New York Times noted West spotted Grant walking along the studio street and instantly knew he was her leading man.\n\n\u201cIf he can talk, I\u2019ll take him,\u201d she quipped.\n\nAccording to Vieira, \u201cShe Done Him Wrong\u201d is still famous for West\u2019s witty zingers, but its most famous line \u2013 \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come up and see me sometime?\u201d \u2013 has been misquoted over the years. The line that West actually purred to Grant is \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come up sometime and see me?\"\n\n'50S ACTRESS KATHLEEN HUGHES TELLS ALL\n\n\u201cThe misquote was happening right after the film,\u201d said Vieira. \u201cIt just worked on many levels.\u201d\n\nVieira shared audiences were immediately captivated by West, whose hourglass figure was draped in sheer, curve-hugging, diamond-embellished gowns that proudly flaunted her assets. Not only did \u201cShe Done Him Wrong\u201d broke box office records in the United States, but it drew audiences throughout the world and saved Paramount from bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cI would say 80 percent of that character is her,\u201d Vieira noted. \u201cInitially people thought those movie posters were awful, too vulgar. But when they saw the film, they realized she\u2019s hilarious\u2026 Mae was a very headstrong person and she knew her business. She wasn\u2019t going to let people run over her\u2026 and she definitely was not a one-man woman.\u201d\n\nWest\u2019s follow-up film, 1933\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m No Angel,\u201d became an even bigger sensation. The Los Angeles Times noted that after three more movies, West was earning the highest salary of any Hollywood star with $300,000 per picture and \u201can additional $100,000 for story or scenario.\u201d\n\nRUTA LEE RECALLS WORKING WITH FRANK SINATRA\n\nAnd West was proud to project sex on her own terms.\n\n\u201cThat was her agenda,\u201d said Vieira. \u201cThat was what she believed in. She thought it was good, it was healthy and she was going to do it.\u201d\n\nWest flourished in Hollywood, but never forgot her roots. From 1954 until 1956 she toured the country with a nightclub act where she surrounded herself with young musclemen. One of her gladiators, Mickey Hargitay, would go on to marry another Hollywood blonde bombshell who found inspiration in West \u2014 Jayne Mansfield.\n\nWest\u2019s last credit film was 1977\u2019s \u201cSextette,\u201d where the actress played a role she knew best \u2014 that of a glamorous silver screen sex symbol. West was 84 at the time.\n\nLUCILLE BALL'S GRANDDAUGHTER TELLS ALL\n\nAnd the woman who personified the sexual innuendo had zero regrets doing things her way.\n\n\u201cI lived like a man, in some ways \u2014 decided what I wanted and went after it,\u201d West once said, as reported by the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry. A friend of mine once wrote that I was \u2018self-enchanted but never self-deceiving,\u2019 and I hope that was always true. I got what I wanted. I still have it. Like I said a long time ago, \u2018a real star never stops.\u2019\u201d\n\nWest passed away in 1980 at age 87.", "description": "Mae West only knew two rules of playwriting \u2013\u00a0\u201cwrite about what you know, and make it entertaining\u201d \u2013\u00a0which is why she chose to write about sex.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-607437620.jpg"}
