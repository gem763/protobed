Words can't describe it,\" said Mark Garrett in an interview with London Morning host Rebecca Zandbergen.\n\n\"I'm sure it was a mumbled bunch of mess that I said to him. But in that time, my pain clouded my mind and my thoughts,\" said Carla Garrett.\n\nFollowing Xavier's death, the Garretts wrote and illustrated a book for kids who are dying, called 'My Love Will Follow You There.'\n\nThe book, 'My Love Will Follow You There' was written by Carla Garrett and illustrated by her husband Mark.\n\n\"That's why this book is so important now because it helps find those words,\" said Carla Garrett.\n\n\"This book is more than just talking about death with your child, but talking about their death, which makes it very different than a lot of other books that are out there...It's helping parents find the words to give their child permission to die and to gently guide them through that space between here and the place we go to next.\"\n\nXavier is survived by his twin sister, Mackenzie.\n\nOn this first day <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BackToSchool?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BackToSchool</a> I want to recognize all the kids going back today without their siblings \ud83d\udc9a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChildhoodCancerAwarenessMonth?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ChildhoodCancerAwarenessMonth</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/theemptyspace?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#theemptyspace</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/OS8XUzyhEy\">pic.twitter.com/OS8XUzyhEy</a> \u2014@mylove_wfyt\n\nSo far, the Garretts have printed 100 copies of the book, which have been mailed out to hospitals, hospices and families around Canada and the United States. The couple's dream is to give the books to families for free.\n\n\"We want to lovingly reassure them that they're loved even if they choose to go...We want it to bring comfort to the child who's suffered long enough and needs to hear it's okay to fly now,\" explained Carla Garrett, who says she misses her son's smile every day.\n\nGetting help to publish\n\nPrinting the books is costly though. A GoFundMe campaign raised the money to get the first books off the printer, but Mark Garrett said they'll need help to print more.\n\n\"We need companies, whether they're local or national to come forward to help fund these books. Our intention, our main goal is to make this resource available to anyone who needs it. We're not making any money off this book. If someone is purchasing a book, that money goes right back into printing new books,\" said Mark Garrett.\n\nMark, Mackenzie, Xavier and Carla Garrett (Submitted by the Garrett family)\n\nMark and Carla Garrett both say they miss their son's laugh and smile the most.\n\n\"Xavier was a loveable boy. His smile and laugh would just melt your heart. He loved music and he liked to read. He loved his video games. We miss him everyday,\" said Mark Garrett through tears.\n\n\"I can hear him still.\"\n\nMark and Carla Garrett appeared on London Morning on Monday, September 9.
