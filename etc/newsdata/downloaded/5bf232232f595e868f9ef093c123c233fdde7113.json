(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nPresident Trump has seen a flood of campaign cash since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched a formal impeachment inquiry into him. Now, the Maryland Republican Party is hoping for the same.\n\n\u201cDemocrat Obstruction Has Gone Far Enough!\u201d begins the fundraising email sent Friday by the Maryland GOP. \u201cNancy Pelosi isn\u2019t calling for the impeachment of President Trump because she thinks he violated any law. She is calling for impeachment because her radical left base is foaming at the mouth, demanding it.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection campaign raised about $13 million in the 24 hours after Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry, sparked by Trump\u2019s apparent efforts to prod Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 opponent.\n\nTrump is deeply unpopular among Maryland Democrats, who outnumber registered Republicans in the state about 2-to-1. But he has a 78 percent approval rating among Marylanders loyal to the GOP.\n\nHis fan base does not extend to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a fellow Republican, who has been sharply critical of Trump, and considered challenging him in the Republican primary. Hogan is in Australia on a trade mission. His spokesman said Friday that when asked about Trump during an interview Wednesday on SkyNews, after Pelosi (D-Calif.) made her announcement, Hogan said, \u201cI think most people just want to get the facts.\u201d\n\nTwo other Republican governors in blue states, Vermont\u2019s Phil Scott and Massachusetts\u2019s Charlie Baker, said Thursday that they support the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe email from the Maryland GOP asks for contributions to the MDGOP Impeachment Defense Fund, which it says will help \u201ccut through the media filter and get the truth out to voters across our state.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump needs his million-strong army of Maryland supporters like you to help us expose the Democrats\u2019 self-righteous fraud,\u201d the email reads. \u201cLet\u2019s put the radical left on notice that their stonewalling and deflection end now.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTwo Republican governors say they support impeachment inquiry of Trump\n\nPoll: Maryland GOP voters widely favor Trump over Larry Hogan for White House\n\nHogan will not challenge Trump, leaving Trump\u2019s GOP critics with limited options\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The party sent an email Friday asking for donations to protect Trump from the \u201cradical left.\u201d", "authors": ["Rachel Chason", "Reporter Covering Local Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zu9qmg5IQ3W0wdDsiQlCGJLod6s=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KLU25QHBL4I6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
