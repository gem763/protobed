(AP) - Tennessee cornerback Bryce Thompson will travel to the Volunteers\u2019 game at No. 9 Florida after getting arrested last month on a misdemeanor domestic assault charge.\n\nVols coach Jeremy Pruitt said Wednesday that Thompson will make the trip but noted that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the sophomore will play Saturday. Pruitt said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to play these other guys, and one of these days Bryce will be back in shape and be ready to play, but it\u2019s going to take a little time for that to happen.\u201d\n\nThompson was suspended after his Aug. 24 arrest and returned to practice last week.\n\nPruitt said linebacker Jeremy Banks also will make the trip. Banks was arrested early Sunday morning after a traffic stop, as police said he had an active warrant for failure to appear in court from an earlier charge of driving with a suspended license.\n\nBanks intercepted two passes last week in a 45-0 victory over Chattanooga.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tennessee cornerback Bryce Thompson will travel to the Volunteers' game at No. 9 Florida after getting arrested last month on a misdemeanor domestic assault charge.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/tennessee_thompson_football_30367_c0-285-3420-2279_s1770x1032.jpg?b3b60db73a9c0fee36a1eb63a3c63b74e59482c3", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
