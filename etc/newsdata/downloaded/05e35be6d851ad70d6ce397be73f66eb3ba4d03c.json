Or are you happy to remain a hypocrite?\" wrote Hamilton cast member Aaron Lee Lambert.\n\n\"Seeing as you've now been announced to be playing an LGBTQ character, I think you owe your LGBTQ peers an explanation.\"\n\n'Taken aback'\n\nOmooba said she was shocked to discover a bible reference posted years ago could leave her career in tatters.\n\n\"I was quite taken aback, I was like 'wow, people really think I hate them?'\" said Omooba.\n\n\"People were calling me 'homophobic' and then I started getting calls from the producers saying something like I should retract the statement or what I posted, or say sorry for what i posted.\"\n\nAt the time the show's producers wrote in a statement: \"Following careful reflection it has been decided that Seyi will no longer be involved with the production.\"\n\nCurve's chief executive Chris Stafford and artistic director Nikolai Foster told the BBC on Monday they stand by the statement but they had \"not received any notice of legal action\".\n\nOmooba claims as well as being dropped by the theatre she has also been dumped by her agent in light of the incident.\n\n\"I didn't think it was get this far, in terms of termination, in terms of me losing an agent. I've been trying to email agents, trying to get work and it's just no response.\n\n\"I didn't think it would escalate to this but now it has and I need to deal with it.\"\n\nThe BBC has asked the Global Artists agency for a comment.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
