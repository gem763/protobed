The company said a customer complaint triggered the recall.\n\nThe recall applies to Carolyn\u2019s Cookie Company\u2019s frozen cookie dough products of several flavors, including chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip toasted walnut, peanut butter chocolate chunk, double chocolate with sea salt, snickerdoodle and oatmeal chocolate chip. The products were packed in 22-ounce plastic pouches with date codes ranging from Sept 12, 2019, to March 29, 2020.\n\nCountry Baking Company\u2019s refrigerated cookie dough was also recalled. Those flavors are chocolate chip and Happy Trails packaged in 24-ounce cardboard sleeves, dated Sept. 18, 2019, to Sept. 25, 2019.\n\nThe California Department of Public Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cookie dough. Representatives for the affected cookie dough brands could not immediately be reached.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe labeling is necessary because people with severe food allergies to tree nuts or peanuts can experience life-threatening reactions if they unknowingly eat a product that contains them.\n\nCalifornia New Foods said it has begun reaching out to retailers who carried the products before they went out of production. It\u2019s unclear how many of the products are still in circulation.\n\nCustomers who bought the products can request a refund. Those with food allergies are urged to discard the products.", "description": "California New Foods said the impacted products are no longer in production or sold in stores, but could affect customers who already purchased and stored them.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/iStock-cookie-dough.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
