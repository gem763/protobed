European leaders are making encouraging noises but the devil is in the detail, and the clock is ticking.\n\nIf Mr Johnson doesn't have a deal by Friday night, a law passed against his wishes by MPs last month requires him to on Saturday ask the EU for a three-month Brexit delay.\n\nThe second job is to get any deal past parliament. After sacking 21 rebel MPs from the Conservative Party, Mr Johnson does not have a majority. He needs to keep his Brexiteers onside, and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), and win back his rebels plus some deal-hungry Labour MPs.\n\nThe DUP's parliamentary leader, Nigel Dodds, used an interview with an Italian newspaper at the weekend to start re-inking his party's red lines. The DUP, which is closely allied to the Conservatives, had been cutting Mr Johnson some slack; but he may be testing their limits.\n\n\"Northern Ireland must remain fully part of the UK customs union. And Boris Johnson knows it very well,\" Mr Dodds told La Repubblica. \"It cannot work because Northern Ireland has to remain fully part of the UK customs union.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDUP opposition would probably then infect a platoon of about two dozen die-hard Tory Brexiteers - leaving Mr Johnson reliant, as his predecessor Theresa May was, on potential rebel Labour votes.\n\nWith that in prospect, House of Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Brexiteer figurehead, wrote an op-ed in The Sunday Telegraph calling on Conservative MPs to back Mr Johnson and accept a compromise.\n\n\"As a Leaver, Boris can be trusted. He wants to take back control and has dedicated his political career to this noble cause,\" Mr Rees-Mogg wrote.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg uses a Sunday op-ed to urge Brexiteers to back PM Boris Johnson. Getty\n\n\"In the final stages of the Brexit negotiation, compromise will inevitably be needed, something even the staunchest Leavers recognise, albeit unwillingly.\"\n\nThe parliamentary sitting on Saturday has yet to take shape, as it depends what happens during the week. The only certainty is that a mass anti-Brexit demonstration is planned for London the same day, calling for a second referendum.\n\nThe referendum spectre hasn't gone way. Even if Mr Johnson comes to parliament with a deal in his pocket, it's now thought possible that a majority of MPs favours putting it to a referendum. Mr Johnson's plan is to move straight to an election.\n\nAccording to the Mail on Sunday, the Tory rebels might still try to force Mr Johnson to delay Brexit even if he does have a deal - probably with a view to having a referendum.", "description": "Hopes have risen that the British PM might find a deal with the EU that can also win a majority in parliament - but it's still all to play for.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2886%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_10%2C$y_41/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3a48cd5d18eba86fc5734063ddc7004ec450fbc9", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
