She also alleged her boss told her: \u201cWe don\u2019t think this is the right bank for you and what do you want to do about it?\u201d\n\nThe tribunal said it had not been persuaded that gender played no part in how bonuses had been set and that Macken, a former vice president at Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), had also been the subject of direct sex discrimination and victimization.\n\nIt dismissed a separate allegation of harassment.\n\n\u201cLeaving a witches\u2019 hat on a female employee\u2019s desk, in a predominantly male working environment, was an inherently sexist act that potentially reflects on the nature of working environment for the claimant and the approach that was taken to women,\u201d the London Central employment tribunal ruled.\n\nIt has yet to decide on the amount of a payout.\n\nA spokesman for BNP Paribas declined to comment.", "description": "A female BNP Paribas broker, whose boss repeatedly brushed aside her questions by saying \"not now, Stacey,\" has won a sexual discrimination and victimization lawsuit in a London employment tribunal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
