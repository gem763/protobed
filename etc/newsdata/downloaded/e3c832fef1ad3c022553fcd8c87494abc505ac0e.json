On Monday, columnist Max Boot took issue with Trump's \"coward\" label for the dead ISIS leader.\n\n\"A president who has never heard a shot fired in anger reveled in Baghdadi's last moments, even claiming 'he died like a coward... whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.' Trump could not possibly have heard \"whimpering and crying\" on the overhead imagery because there was no audio,\" Boot wrote in his piece. \"The assertion that Baghdadi died as a coward was, in any case, contradicted by the fact that rather than be captured, he blew himself up.\"\n\nBoot, a CNN analyst, also shared his assertion in a tweet, which he later deleted.\n\nMIKE POMPEO BLASTS THE WASHINGTON POST FOR 'APPALLING AND SICK' AL-BAGHDADI HEADLINE\n\nHe later clarified that the excerpt from his piece was removed and attempted to offer an explanation.\n\n\"An earlier version included a sentence questioning whether Trump was right to call Baghdadi a coward. That was removed b/c it wrongly conveyed the impression that I considered Baghdadi courageous. As I wrote Sun: Baghdadi was 'a sick and depraved man,'\" Boot tweeted.\n\nMany critics on Twitter mocked Boot, with some predicting his next column would be an outcry of Trump's praise for the military dog who assisted in the mission to take down al-Baghdadi.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Washington Post did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.", "description": "It appears The Washington Post isn't done offering questionable coverage in the death of ISIS leader\u00a0Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, publishing a new column that slammed President Trump for calling the deceased terrorist a \"coward.\"", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
