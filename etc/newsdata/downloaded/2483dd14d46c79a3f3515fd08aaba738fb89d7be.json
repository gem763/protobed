The allegations concern tax violations, money-laundering and licences given to Burisma during the period where Zlochevsky was a minister.\n\nRevelations in a whistleblower complaint that Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pressed the Ukrainians to pursue investigations into Burisma and the role of Hunter Biden have sparked an impeachment inquiry by Democrats in the House of Representatives. Trump faces allegations that he withheld U.S. military assistance for Ukraine to place pressure on Kiev to investigate his potential Democratic rival in next year\u2019s U.S. presidential election.\n\nGiuliani has alleged, without providing evidence, that Joe Biden pushed for the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor to end an investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky in order to protect his son.\n\nHunter Biden, 49 years old, has denied wrongdoing. In a public statement on Oct 13, his lawyer George Mesires said: \u201cDespite extensive scrutiny, at no time has any law enforcement agency, either domestic or foreign, alleged that Hunter engaged in wrongdoing at any point during his five-year term.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with ABC News aired Tuesday, Hunter Biden said in retrospect it may have been poor judgment to join Burisma\u2019s board while his father was vice president, but added: \u201cDid I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nBiden, in the interview added that he didn\u2019t discuss his business dealings in Ukraine with his father, other than one brief exchange in which his father told him \u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Hunter Biden didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nJoe Biden has also denied any wrongdoing, saying he called for the removal of then-chief prosecutor Viktor Shokin in 2016 because of his ineffectiveness in tackling corruption in Ukraine, a widespread problem that both the United States and the European Union had long highlighted.\n\nA spokesman for Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, Andrew Bates, said: \"Donald Trump is so terrified of running against Joe Biden that he sent his presidency into a tailspin by trying to blackmail Ukraine into intervening in our elections with universally-debunked lies.\u201d\n\nBurisma and Zlochevsky didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters in September, former Ukraine prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko said Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board when his father was vice-president raised no red flags. \u201cFrom the point of view of Ukrainian law, (Hunter Biden) didn\u2019t violate anything,\u201d Lutsenko said.\n\nUkraine\u2019s new general prosecutor Ruslan Ryaboshapka, who took over in August, said he was not aware of any wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. His office announced on Oct 4 that it was reviewing 15 previous investigations related to Zlochevsky but no decision had been taken on how to proceed against him or people related to him.\n\nThe White House declined to comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCEREMONIAL FIGURE\u201d\n\nZlochevsky, who founded Burisma in 2002, served as a minister under Ukraine\u2019s then-President Viktor Yanukovich from 2010 to 2012. Burisma then began adding high-profile names to its board, including Biden and a business associate of his called Devon Archer, in April 2014.", "description": "During his time on the board of one of Ukraine\u2019s largest natural gas companies, Hunter Biden, the son of former U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden, was regarded as a helpful non-executive director with a powerful name, according to people familiar with Biden\u2019s role at the company.
