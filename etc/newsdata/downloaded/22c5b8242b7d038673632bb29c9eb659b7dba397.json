He managed to return to his hotel room, where he called for help around midnight, according to a statement from the National Park Service.\n\nSiemers suffered severe burns to a significant part of his body. He fell into water that was 150 degrees when it was tested in August, according to park spokeswoman Morgan Warthin.\n\nRangers, per the statement, noted that Siemers may have consumed alcohol before his fall. They found Siemers' shoe, a hat and a beer can near the geyser, and blood nearby.\n\nWalking off the boardwalks by Old Faithful is illegal, punishable by up to six months in prison and a $5,000 fine. Siemers may face criminal charges.\n\nA statement from the Park Service adds that Siemers' injury is the first in a hot spring in two years, following an injury in June 2017. The most recent death took place a year earlier, in June 2016, when a man slipped into a hot spring after leaving the boardwalk.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.
