In that moment, as a man ahead of her in first class whooped with delight, Raphael decided to perform a small act of rebellion on the half-empty plane.\n\nShe took up space.\n\nTo another man who had moved up to take the aisle seat of her otherwise empty row, Raphael turned and deadpanned: No, he could not sit with her; she\u2019d booked the whole row for herself. This was, of course, a lie. But with the man suitably dispatched, Raphael spread herself out, pulled a coat over her Hillary T-shirt, and started to process the new reality of a Clinton loss and a Trump win.\n\nNow, almost three years later, Raphael is (nearly) done grieving. Instead, she\u2019s mobilizing.\n\nIn the last 18 months \u2015 in addition to acting in a Hollywood film with Charlize Theron (\u201cLong Shot\u201d) and filming seasons 5 and 6 of her Netflix show \u2015 Raphael co-founded The Jane Club, a women\u2019s space in Los Angeles designed specifically for working parents, and wrote a book, \u201dRepresent: The Woman\u2019s Guide to Running for Office & Changing the World,\u201d with former EMILY\u2019s List activist Kate Black to inspire women to run for office. The latter has been something of a self-described \u201cobsession.\u201d\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost Actor June Diane Raphael poses for photos after a taping of the HuffPost show \"Between You & Me\" in Los Angeles on July 12, 2019.\n\n\u201cI had become, after Trump\u2019s election, kind of obsessed with the idea of how this man won and also how public service and civic engagement is sometimes left or seen as left best for others to do,\u201d Raphael told me on HuffPost\u2019s \u201cBetween You & Me.\u201d \u201cAt the core of our country, I really believe in the idea of \u2018We the people\u2019 and people representing themselves. And I think if you really look at the way our government works, it is not representative of the vast majority of people who live here, and that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nSo it was perhaps not surprising that when I asked Raphael if she plans to run for office one day, she was unequivocal.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said, before launching into an impassioned dialogue about the LA public school system and wanting to understand more explicitly how it functions and where the roadblocks are.\n\nShe\u2019s also been driven by the need to restore order amid the chaos of the Trump presidency, she said. \u201cIt was a sense of our democracy is crumbling before my very eyes. And if this motherfucker can do it, why can\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nPolitical office isn\u2019t yet in danger of eclipsing Raphael\u2019s day job. \u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d will be filming a just announced seventh and final season. And she is set to star alongside Tracee Ellis Ross in the upcoming film \u201cCovers,\u201d directed by Nisha Ganatra (\u201cLate Night,\u201d \u201cTransparent\u201d).\n\nBut she makes it clear with her book that just because some people might dismiss her as another Hollywood actor talking about activism, that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to sit back and watch as many of the values she holds dear, particularly reproductive rights, are eroded.\n\n\u201cI would only get quiet if I didn\u2019t pay my taxes,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether someone likes it or not is their problem.\u201d\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost Raphael is speaking out because, she said, \"our democracy is crumbling before my very eyes.\"", "description": "\u201cOur democracy is crumbling before my very eyes.
