Would you do it?\n\nHell no!\n\nAnd yet this is exactly what\u2019s happening right now in the banking systems of Japan, Germany, France, and other European countries.\n\nNegative interest rates \u2014 where the lender gets paid back less than they\u2019ve loaned \u2014 now add up to 30%, (and counting), of the global tradable bond universe, according to JPMorgan (JPM). You may have seen for instance that Germany just sold the first negative yielding 30-year bond issue.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, yes, this is crazy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unusual and really distorting the global financial system,\u201d says Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities (DB). \u201cI spend all my time talking about it.\u201d\n\nThis is not going to end well\n\nNegative rates are counterintuitive, unprecedented \u2014 and to my mind \u2014 mind-bendingly insane and downright scary. They are like a parallel universe where everything you\u2019ve ever learned about finance and human behavior is turned upside down.\n\nNegative interest rates could spell serious trouble for the financial markets. Image: Getty More\n\nWorse, negative rates are being normalized by economists, bankers, and commentators.\n\nWorst, I have a funny feeling this will end badly. Negative interest rates have all the hallmarks of serious trouble for the financial markets; an anomaly growing in scale which seemingly came out of nowhere that is under-recognized, poorly understood and dismissed as not consequential. (Flashing red lights here.)\n\nIn the U.S. we aren\u2019t particularly aware of negative rates because they haven\u2019t made their way to our shores ... perhaps yet.\n\nYes, the U.S. ten year Treasury yields 1.59%, not close to 0%, but negative rates seem to be creeping ever closer. For instance, negative interest rates haven\u2019t come to U.S. corporate debt, but Euro-denominated bonds issued by the likes of blue-chips Apple (AAPL), McDonald\u2019s (MCD), and Pepsi (PEP) carry negative yields.\n\nAnd in Europe, it was postulated that negative rates would never fly in the consumer sphere in terms of banks paying back depositors less than they put in their savings accounts, but that\u2019s now changing. Banks in Denmark and Switzerland are now charging customers to hold deposits. And on the flip side, and also in Denmark, mortgages with negative rates are available. That\u2019s right, you get a mortgage from the bank, and the bank essentially pays you each month. A three-year adjustable rate mortgage priced at negative .28% there recently.\n\n\u201cHelt vildt,\u201d as the Danes might say. Translation: \u201cTotally nuts.\u201d\n\nA woman looks at an electronic stock board showing Japan's Nikkei 225 index at a securities firm in Tokyo.

It appears that negative interest rates are a modern phenomenon that was first implemented to spur sluggish economies that couldn\u2019t get traction coming out of the Great Recession. (Yes, brought to you by central bankers.)
