It is shameful that the authorities would attempt to present this punishment as anything other than what it is: an abhorrent form of torture.\u201d\n\nOne of the last times Iran cut someone\u2019s fingers off was in January 2018, when a 34-year-old was found guilty of stealing sheep, the BBC reports.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Islamic Republic also was criticized by Amnesty International last year after images emerged of a man being publicly flogged following a conviction for consuming alcohol at a wedding he attended as a teenager a decade earlier.", "description": "An Iranian man reportedly has had his fingers cut off after being found guilty of more than two dozen cases of theft.", "authors": ["Greg Norman"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/iran-amputation.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
