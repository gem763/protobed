You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFurthermore, Kantar noted \u201csmall reductions\u201d in the amount of money being spent on products such as meat, bottled drinks and beauty wipes.\n\n\u201cAs markets get wealthier, the focus on issues of environmentalism and plastics increases. In the future, we could expect to see the share of \u2018eco active\u2019 shoppers rising in countries that experience growing gross domestic product,\u201d Kantar stated.\n\nThe survey found that consumers in western Europe are the most likely to strive to reduce their impact on the environment.\n\nHowever, Chile was found to be the country with the most environmentally-conscious consumers, with 37 per cent of the study\u2019s Chilean participants saying that they are attempting to reduce their imprint on the environment.\n\nThe second most environmentally-conscious consumers came from Austria, while the third-most came from Germany, and the fourth-most came from Britain.\n\nAccording to Kantar, sales of fresh meat in Britain could fall by around four per cent in the next couple of years as the public becomes more aware of environmental issues.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

According to the United Nations Environment Programme, at current rates of pollution, there will likely be more plastic in the sea than fish by 2050. AFP/Getty 4/15 Plastics and other detritus line the shore of the Thames Estuary. In December 2017 Britain joined the other 193 UN countries and signed up to a resolution to help eliminate marine litter and microplastics in the sea. It is estimated that about eight million metric tons of plastic find their way into the world's oceans every year. Once in the Ocean plastic can take hundreds of years to degrade, all the while breaking down into smaller and smaller 'microplastics,' which can be consumed by marine animals, and find their way into the human food chain.

The Yamuna River, like all other holy rivers in India, has been massively polluted for decades now. The river that originates in a glacier in the pristine and unpolluted Himalayas, and flows through Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh before merging with the Ganges River in Allahabad, once used to be the lifeline of the Indian capital. Currently, it is no more than a large, open sewer that is choking with industrial and domestic discharge that includes plastic, flowers and debris and has virtually no aquatic life.
