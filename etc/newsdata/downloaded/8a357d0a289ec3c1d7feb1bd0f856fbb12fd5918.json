I want to know more so I can plan. Because at the moment, I cannot plan anything in my life. Joana Ferreira Dentist\n\nBut those who often slip under the public radar are the ones who will perhaps be worst affected by Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.\n\nEuronews reporter Val\u00e9rie Gauriat was in London to hear the concerns of some of them.\n\nLike Joana Ferreira, a dentist working in a private practice in the outskirts of London.\n\nShe came here from Portugal, four and a half years ago.\n\nOur team met her a few days before Theresa May unveiled proposals to protect EU expatriates\u2019 rights.\n\nThe young woman, and her romanian colleague, were highly concerned about their future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just worried about the living conditions, really,\u201d said Ferreira.\n\n\u201cAm I going to be able to work? Am I going to get a normal salary, like everyone? Am I going to be kicked out of the country? I don\u2019t know, nobody knows!\u201d\n\nJoana and her husband feel invested in the UK in more than one way.\n\nTheir three year old daughter was born here; they planned for her to grow up in the country.\n\n\u201cI just recently bought a house, just before Brexit happened, so I\u2019m wondering, what will I do now? Because even if I want to go back to Portugal I\u2019m not sure how to proceed Because now the house prices are getting down, so even if I sell my house today, I\u2019m afraid, financially, of being in a worse situation.\n\nI just feel very insecure of what\u2019s going to happen in the future. I really want to know more so I can plan. Because at the moment, I cannot plan anything in my life.\u201d, she said.\n\nDental nurse Alexandra has lived in the UK for the same amount of time as Joana.\n\nShe was working in another practice a year ago; and was fired the day after the Brexit referendum, with no justification.\n\nIt took her time to find a new job she tells us.\n\nShe enjoys working with Joana at the practice, where she was hired a few months ago.\n\nBut her fears that day were even greater than Joana\u2019s:\n\n\u201cI plan to stay in the UK, but at the same time I\u2019m scared. Because I don\u2019t know what will happen tomorrow,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou might be on a holiday, just a simple holiday and come back, and they might tell you that you can\u2019t come anymore. You don\u2019t have a visa, you can\u2019t prove that you built something here, and they might not let you come back.\u201d\n\nJoana and Alexandra\u2019s employer expressed concern: 60 percent of the staff at the four practices she manages are non-British EU nationals.\n\nSmita Mehra, Managing Director of The Neem Tree told Euronews: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very privileged because there have been no barriers to recruitment and barriers to working laws or working conditions. Now if that were all to change it would produce uncertain times, and so I\u2019m praying that things won\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nThe new plan regarding expatriates put on the negociation table in Brussels, does not lift all uncertainties.\n\nBusiness as well as people stands to lose out\n\nIt\u2019s a crucial issue for the many areas of the UK economy which rely heavily on the European workforce.\n\nThe UK\u2019s construction sector alone fears losing between 100,000 and 200,000 skilled and unskilled workers.\n\nOne of those keeping a keen eye on Brexit negotiations as they unfold is Azad Azam: his construction SME is already feeling the pressure.\n\nOne third of his employees come from Eastern Europe.\n\nSuch as, Florin, who\u2019s from Romania. He started working for Azad 6 months ago.\n\n\u201cWe did offer him a permanent position, as he\u2019s done really well he\u2019s incredibly skillful.\u201d says Azam.\n\n\u201cAnd as a result of that the contract I\u2019ve offered him is 3 years. He\u2019s got a family back home, he\u2019s got a wife, he\u2019s got a child, and his intention is to make the UK their permanent home.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, as a result of Brexit we\u2019re now in a position where the uncertainties created so many problems for him, we don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s going to be able to stay, he doesn\u2019t even know whether he\u2019s going to be able to stay,\u201d Azam says.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming increasingly hard to recruit qualified workers from the EU, he tells Val\u00e9rie Gauriat.\n\n\u201cThe impact of that now is that we can\u2019t increase our workforce the way we want to.\n\nIf we put job vacancies adds in the British press, we get no response,\u201d says Azad. \u201cNobody wants to be electricians nowadays, nobody wants to be a carpenter, nobody wants to be doing what Florin is doing, brick-laying.\u201d\n\nDemand for work has not dropped, and the company backlog is full.\n\nBut the Brexit says Azad, threatens the business he runs with his wife.\n\nThey\u2019ve recently had to turn down some of the biggest deals of his career \u2013 a 2,5 million pound construction contract for a series of luxury houses \u2013 because he couldn\u2019t find the workforce required.\n\nAdd to this the threat of the return of trade barriers and tariffs, and Azad finds himself between a rock and a hard place.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the construction industry you have a lot of materials coming from Europe.\n\n\u201cNow if we don\u2019t get the trade agreements that the government has suggested they\u2019re going to try to get, then all these supplies and all of those prices are just going to increase. Then we\u2019re not going to be even able to deliver the projects at the prices that we were previously going to, because everything is going to go up.\u201d\n\nWider economy in jeopardy\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations is already influencing economic forecasts.\n\nAccording to the Bank of England, the level of planned investment in the country could drop by 25 percent by 2019.\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry expects a strong slowdown in growth, by 2018 as well as a rise in inflation, which is already hitting consumers.\n\nThe gradual depreciation of the pound which followed the sharp drop in value after the referendum persists.\n\nWhile the exporters are reveling in the price hike, many importers are finding it hard to sustain.\n\n\u2018People carry on drinking through uncertainty\u2019\n\nTom Lowe and his brother founded the independent brewing company Fourpure four years ago, on the outskirts of London.\n\nMost of the raw material they use, such as hops, as well as equipment, is imported from the United States and Europe.\n\nTom told Euronews: \u201cOur kegs come from Germany. Overnight when the Brexit vote happened, they went from \u00a360 a keg to \u00a370 a keg, that\u2019s a \u00a310 uplift. We had 2,500 kegs coming in at the time. So you know, you can do the maths\u2026\u201d\n\nHowever, the brewer will not allow his spirits to be dampened by Brexit.\n\nThe company relies on growth to offset rising costs.\n\n\u201cI think as a small business we\u2019re nimble enough, we\u2019re agile enough to be able to make whatever comes our way work.\u201d, he tells Val\u00e9rie Gauriat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve invested in a new brew house, and that will help with economies of scale. Our key drive at the moment is to be as efficient as we can and to try to make sure that we don\u2019t have to raise prices too much for our customers\u201d\n\nThe family business is confident:\n\nbeer, like weapons, says Tom, is a bullet-proof industry\u2026\n\n\u201cPeople carry on drinking through uncertainty and also economic decline, or whatever is on the horizon.\n\nWe have to keep people fed, well.. watered, and we\u2019re excited about meeting people\u2019s needs, whatever happens off the back of the Brexit conundrum.\u201d\n\nLive updates from our Insiders team", "description": "Euronews looks at those set to lose the most from Brexit negotiations.", "authors": ["Val\u00e9rie Gauriat", "Joana Ferreira"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/374165/1000x563_374165.jpg", "published_at": "2017-06-23"}
