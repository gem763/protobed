The only survivor was 15-year-old Cassidy Stay, who was also shot in the head, but survived and played dead until Haskell left.\n\nProsecutor Samantha Knecht said: \u2018It\u2019s not a coincidence that he picked July 9, 2014 to go to the Stay\u2019s house. It\u2019s one year to the day and time he was served with a protective order. That\u2019s when the revenge in his heart began to grow.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaskell was found guilty of capital murder in September after jurors hear harrowing testimony from Cassidy.\n\nCassidy said she didn\u2019t immediately recognize her \u2018Uncle Ronnie,\u2019 but after she did, she begged him: \u2018Please don\u2019t hurt us,\u2019, telling the court that she knew \u2018how awful he was.\u2019\n\nHaskell was reportedly armed with a handgun that he outfitted with a home silencer made out of a pillow.
