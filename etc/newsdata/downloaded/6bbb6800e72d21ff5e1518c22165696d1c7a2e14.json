Always insert \u201calmost\u201d when mentioning this club. They make 98-percent chance feel like \u201cpick \u2019em.\u201d\n\nThe Chicago Cubs, in a state of utter collapse at rainy Wrigley Field, can\u2019t win. The Milwaukee Brewers, playing without lost-for-the-year superstar Christian Yelich, simply refuse to lose.\n\nLoss to last-place Marlins again shines light on Nationals\u2019 bullpen trust issues\n\nAs a result, the Nats find themselves in a situation that may define a baseball \u201cmixed blessing.\u201d Despite another blown-save loss in Miami on Sunday, this one by a score of 5-3, the Nats remain four games (and five in the all-important loss column) ahead of the Cubs, the closest team that could knock them out of the playoffs. The New York Mets are 4\u00bd back, the Philadelphia Phillies 5\u00bd back entering their game Sunday night. It\u2019s remarkable that any team can be in the Nats\u2019 seat \u2014 counting down its magic number to the playoffs \u2014 after burying itself with a 19-31 start.\n\nYet, because the Brewers have won 15 of 17, making up seven games on the Nats since Sept. 6, Washington has no idea where it would play a highly likely wild-card game Oct. 1. Would it be at Nationals Park or Milwaukee against a dogged Brew Crew that is now in a virtual tie with them for the first wild-card spot?\n\nThe Nats have a tiny edge \u2014 a one-game lead in the loss column. However, the Brewers have a more meaningful advantage \u2014 the homefield tiebreaker for a wild-card matchup \u2014 thanks to a 4-2 season-series win. How did they get it? Just point at their 15-14 win in 14 innings in August when the Nats blew an 11-8 lead in the ninth. Does that capture the mood and meaning of this season well enough?\n\nBefore anyone bemoans how the Nats blew a 4-0 lead (and a Stephen Strasburg win) in the eighth inning Saturday \u2014 before winning 10-4 in the 10th \u2014 or how rookie Austin Voth was cost a win when the Nats blew a 3-1 lead Sunday, please, stop to bow your head for the Cubs.\n\nNo Cubs team, not the worst of \u2019em, has been swept in four games at Wrigley Field by the hated St. Louis Cardinals since 1921. Well, it just happened again. At times, playoff spots are more about scoreboard watching than winning. Is the scoreboard in Wrigley still standing?\n\nManager Joe Maddon, who may soon be ex-Cubs manager Joe Maddon, tried eight relievers in a game against the Cardinals \u2014 twice. He called on $43 million August signee Craig Kimbrel twice in huge situations. On Thursday, Kimbrel gave up a first-pitch homer to lose the game. On Saturday, he gave up homers on his first two pitches to lose again. The Nats\u2019 MVP for September? Maybe Kimbrel.\n\nIn the annals of be-careful-what-you-wish-for, Kimbrel may now be the leader in the clubhouse. Since February, many Nats players and executives lobbied ownership to pony up for Kimbrel, despite his rocky second half in 2018. Fans, media and, for sure, me, said: Take a shot?\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nNationals\u2019 Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera should avoid MRI after tweaking right ankle\n\nBy Sunday, Maddon stuck with starter Yu Darvish, leading 2-1 in the ninth. Hope, still not a strategy. On the 110th pitch, Joe got the memo: Yu lose.\n\nNow, the Nats enter a week \u2014 with eight games in seven days \u2014 that is wrapped in layers of irony. Bryce Harper will come to town for five games in four days with his highly touted Phillies likely to be knocked out for the season by the Nats team that he left. In Philly, he\u2019s done almost a stat duplicate of his 2018 in D.C. And that tells a large story.\n\nWith 33 homers, 108 RBI and an .876 on-base-plus-slugging percentage entering Sunday \u2014 marks in which he ranked 30th, 12th and 44th in MLB \u2014 Harper has had a fine, typical slugging season for him. In FanGraphs\u2019 all-encompassing Wins Above Replacement, his value (4.3 wins) ranks 30th among everyday players. Also, 14 starting pitchers are worth more, too.\n\nSo, for the seventh time in his eight seasons, he has not been a \u201cgenerational\u201d player. The Nats have replaced perhaps half of his value in right field with Adam Eaton (2.3 WAR) while using $140 million to sign left-hander Patrick Corbin, whose 4.9 WAR is comparable to Harper\u2019s. Net-net, for one year, the Nats have used resources better without him. Check back annually for 12 more years.\n\nWhen the Nats rebuilt \u2014 without Harper, Gio Gonzalez, Daniel Murphy, Tanner Roark, Matt Wieters and several discarded relievers \u2014 they did a stellar job of fixing several positions and keeping others adequate. It was high-degree-of-difficulty juggling that has the Nats on track to win 89 games \u2014 seven more than last year \u2014 despite injuries.\n\nBut the bullpen is, to date, an epic fail, both in construction and in the ability of a second-year manager to minimize its weaknesses. We\u2019ll never know who might have done better \u2014 but many of us will wonder.\n\nThis eight-game final week, which seemed diabolically designed to put the maximum pressure on the Nats\u2019 pitching staff and its handling, will give a spunky but deeply flawed team a final chance to put itself in the best position for October \u2014 with a wild-card game at home. It\u2019ll be a fair fight. Milwaukee has an easy schedule. But it doesn\u2019t have Yelich.\n\nThe Nats, despite their shaky September, have had good fortune so far. Their toughest wild card-wild card matchup on paper \u2014 against Jacob deGrom and the Mets \u2014 is on life support in Queens.\n\nThe Brewers are a solid slugging team, but they have no dominant starter \u2014 on paper \u2014 to equal Max Scherzer or Strasburg. For the whole year, they have been outscored by two runs. In their past 102 games, the Nats have outscored their foes by 159 runs. The Brewers may have Josh Hader to close, but they\u2019re no juggernaut.\n\nFinally, in the best piece of dumb luck, the Cubs\u2019 collapse almost certainly means the Nats \u2014 if they give any sort of credible account of themselves at home this week \u2014 will have a game Oct. 1. As a result, their plan to use their Big Three starters out of the bullpen in the postseason \u2014 very selectively, but in the highest-leverage spots \u2014 may come into play.\n\nIf that Nats\u2019 bullpen gate does open on Oct. 1, the first man out may well be Corbin and his 224 strikeouts. Can everyone say, \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nNationals catcher Kurt Suzuki balancing health concerns with urgency of pennant race\n\nAnthony Rendon\u2019s MVP case is gaining momentum but running out of time\n\nPlayoff chases are fun, aren\u2019t they, Nats fans?
