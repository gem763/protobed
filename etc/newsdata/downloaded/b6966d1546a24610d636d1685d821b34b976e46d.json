It was enthusiastically pumping all the venom it could muster into our leader\u2019s hand. And it was my fault.\n\nI was in Madagascar as \u201cthe expert\u201d, so when I saw this pretty black-and-white snake beside the path on our night walk, I did the obvious thing \u2013 told Daniel to pick it up while I gave the group the benefit of my knowledge. \u201cYou see\u201d I explained, \u201cthere are no venomous snakes in Madagascar, so you can safely handle any of them\u201d.\n\n\u201cActually\u201d said Daniel, rather more knowledgeably, \u201csome species are venomous, including this cat-eyed snake, but they are back-fanged\u201d. He picked it up skilfully, but something went wrong and the snake managed to turn its head and sink its (back) fangs into Daniel\u2019s finger. It could hardly believe its luck at finally getting its teeth into a human hand, and was not going to let go in a hurry. The considerable efforts of two guides were needed to persuade it to release its grip.", "description": "Inspiration for your inbox", "authors": ["Hilary Bradt", "Founder Of Bradt Travel Guides"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/September/sifaka-iStock-501262128-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
