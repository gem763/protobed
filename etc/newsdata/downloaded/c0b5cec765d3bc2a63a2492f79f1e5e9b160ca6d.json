I will be up in arms. I refuse to lose my freedoms with constant surveillance of every little thing the government decides that I may or may not be doing wrong.\"\n\nParliament's joint intelligence committee on Thursday rejected the Morrison government's bill, sending the plan back to the drawing board.\n\nFirst introduced to Parliament in 2018, it was designed to enable a range of services to identify and cross-reference images of people's faces.\n\nPeter Dutton's Home Affairs Department would be given power to maintain a national database for the sharing and verification of facial images, helping state and federal government agencies and even some private sector organisations use images from driver\u2019s licences and passports for law enforcement.\n\nIn an age of growing surveillance here and around the world, facial recognition technology is being used to target protesters and criminals.\n\nCommittee chairman and Liberal backbencher Andrew Hastie, backed up by big names from both major parties, said improved safeguards were needed.\n\nA new version of the bill is likely to be considered by the committee in 2020.\n\nLabor made measured criticism, offering a constructive approach to help give cover to Liberal committee members who had stood up to their own government's plan, first proposed under Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaking 'us all potential suspects'\n\nUniversity of NSW academic Monika Zalnieriute said the scheme's original justification was to help identify suspects or victims of terrorism and criminal activity.\n\n\"The benefits of the proposed network seem to be small compared to its intrusive nature,\" she said.\n\n\"The officially purported benefit of preventing ID fraud seems to shrink even further when considering the danger of the scheme creeping into a nationwide surveillance infrastructure.\n\n\"Such mission creep seems to be particularly likely given that the scheme was agreed for fighting terrorism.\"\n\nSecurity at the Commonwealth Games included trials of facial recognition technology. AP\n\nDr Zalnieriute, part of the Allens Hub for Technology, Law & Innovation, said Western governments were experimenting with facial recognition technology, coming as China was expanding use to profile ethnic Uyghurs and monitor pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nShe pointed to a trial by Queensland police during the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games and testing in Perth and Brisbane.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice experimented at London's popular Notting Hill Carnival, with information disclosures sought by opponents later revealing a 98 per cent failure rate.\n\nNew York lawmakers this week began considering a plan to require businesses and landlords to disclose their use of the technology.\n\n\"The urgent question we need to ask is whether we want our government to rely on technology making us all potential suspects,\" Dr Zalnieriute said.\n\nMr Dutton maintains the laws remain badly needed.\n\n\"It's nothing about mass surveillance,\" he told Nine. \"It's about making sure that we can protect Australians who have their identities stolen.\"", "description": "An influential parliamentary committee sent the Morrison government back to the drawing board on the roll-out of facial recognition.
