It's a question of energy sovereignty,\" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told a news conference to present the report, in a rebuke of EDF's handling of its flagship projects.\n\nLe Maire said delays at Flamanville - which will take 15 years to get up and running instead of six, and cost almost four times as much as initially planned - were \"a failure for France's entire electricity and nuclear sector.\"\n\nSkills shortages were so severe that most of the weldings in the Flamanville project had to be done by foreign sub-contractors, Le Maire added.\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPPLIER STRAINS\n\nEDF, which is 84%-owned by the French state and aims be a global leader in nuclear energy, revealed in early October that the Flamanville project, started in 2006, would cost 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) more than previously expected.\n\nThe total bill now runs at 12.4 billion euros.\n\nEDF has had to contend with problems with some weldings, which it was ordered to repair by nuclear safety watchdog ASN.\n\nBut the audit also underlined the absence of a clear project leader for Flamanville from the outset.\n\nAnd while the company was tripped up by a changing regulatory backdrop to some degree, the report said EDF had a strained relationship with suppliers, and in particular Areva.\n\nNow known as Framatome and 75% controlled by EDF since 2018, Areva was long considered a rival.\n\nEDF Chief Executive Jean-Bernard Levy will have a month to present his proposals, Le Maire said. The minister reiterated his support to the former Thales boss, who has been at the helm of the utility since 2014, and said the government would check on how the action plan was being implemented by the end of 2020.\n\n\"It's true, France's nuclear industry is going through a difficult time,\" Levy told the same news conference, adding that EDF would \"double down on its efforts\".\n\nEDF has also had to hike its cost estimates for the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant it is building in Britain, and it recently encountered a separate problem with defective weldings at some steam generators of its reactors, although ASN subsequently ruled these could remain operational.\n\n($1 = 0.9014 euros) (Reporting by Bate Felix and Sarah White; Writing by Matthieu Protard; Editing by Mark Potter)", "description": "EDF must present an action plan within a month on how to tackle skills shortages and other problems that have caused delays at key nuclear projects and damaged the reputation of the industry, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Monday.  \"The nuclear sector has to get back on track.", "authors": ["Sarah White"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
