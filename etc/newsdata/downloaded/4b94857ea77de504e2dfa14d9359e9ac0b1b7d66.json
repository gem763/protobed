Lintao Zhang/Pool via Reuters\n\nAfter a hearing at a military tribunal, Kamto, wearing a dark suit and blue tie, was released to a crowd of cheering supporters in the capital Yaounde.\n\nBiya, who has governed Cameroon for nearly four decades, is seeking to calm unrest stoked by a disputed presidential election last year and a separatist insurrection that has cost close to 2,000 lives over the past two years.\n\nKamto, the head of the opposition Cameroon Renaissance Movement (MRC), finished runner-up to Biya in last October\u2019s presidential election but denounced the result as fraudulent.\n\nHe was arrested in January after leading protests which security forces dispersed with live bullets, and faced charges before a military court which his lawyers said could have carried the death penalty. [nL5N2082IG]\n\nThe government announced on Friday that some MRC members would be freed, saying Biya was determined \u201cto relentlessly pursue his efforts to find ways to peacefully resolve the disagreements confronting our country\u201d.\n\nBesides Kamto, about 100 other CRM members were released, lawyers involved in the case said.\n\n\u201cThis release is a good thing. It shows good faith,\u201d Felix Agbor, one of Kamto\u2019s lawyers, told Reuters. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s necessary to pardon others who have already been convicted.\u201d\n\nBiya also ordered 333 other prisoners arrested in the conflict with Anglophone separatists freed on Thursday as part of week-long talks aimed at ending the rebellion. [nL5N26O5B0]\n\nThe insurrection, which began as peaceful protests by English speakers against their perceived marginalisation by the French-speaking majority, now aims to create an independent state including Cameroon\u2019s two Anglophone regions.\n\nIt has emerged as the biggest security challenge of Biya\u2019s tenure, forcing half a million people from their homes.\n\nBut separatist leaders have rejected Biya\u2019s recent overtures to bring an end to the conflict and dismissed Thursday\u2019s announcement as a political stunt.
