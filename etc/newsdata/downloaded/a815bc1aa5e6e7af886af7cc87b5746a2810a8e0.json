Photo: AP/Shutterstock\n\nWith Friends\u2019 25th anniversary rapidly approaching at the end of the month, we wouldn\u2019t blame you if, say, you wanted to express your love for the sitcom by buying a whimsical peephole frame for your door or naming your new cat Gunther. What is not advisable, though, is trekking on a full bladder to the show\u2019s famed apartment exterior on the corner of Bedford and Grove Streets, and whizzing all over the door. We wish a reminder of such uncouth behavior would be unnecessary, but here we are. Now let\u2019s make this an educational moment. Because hidden within a New York Post article about how local West Village residents are pissed about a planned Friends outdoor couch installation, one resident summed up his irritation by recalling the near-constant public urination he deals with from the show\u2019s fans.\n\n\u201cWe have at least 400 tourists a day coming to look at that building. They take pictures all day and all night. I come outside and there\u2019s 20 people hanging out on my stoop or taking a pee around the corner,\u201d Rezar Skoda told the Post. \u201cTo close off the street or a section of the sidewalk would make it crazy.\u201d Despite Warner Bros. Television filing the correct permits for the nostalgic publicity stunt \u2014 which would close the entirety of Bedford between Grove and Barrow for an unknown amount of time \u2014 residents are pissed (heh) that a representative from the studio didn\u2019t show up to explain to logistics at a recent community-board meeting. \u201cWe are hopeful we can still move forward with the permit and create a unique experience for fans,\u201d Warner Bros. said in a statement. Just, please, hit up the toilet beforehand.", "description": "The \u201cFriends\u201d apartment has become an unlikely mecca for people (and we\u2019re assuming, fans) peeing around the building.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/03/03-friends-building.w1200.h630.jpg"}
