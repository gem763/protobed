(Mauricio Lima/The New York Times)\n\nTurkish forces began a long-anticipated cross-border assault on Wednesday against the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led militia, in northeastern Syria.\n\nThe dispute between Turkey and the Kurds has deep roots in regional power dynamics that have created a tangled web of interests. Further complicating the picture is the fact that the United States is an ally of both Turkey and the SDF, as the militia is known.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said the goal of the incursion was \u201cto destroy the terror corridor\u201d that he said Kurdish forces were trying to establish on his country\u2019s southern border, and to bring peace to the region.\n\nLeaders of the SDF and others in the region say the strikes are putting civilians at risk, and warned of an imminent humanitarian crisis. Kurdish groups on the ground shared photographs and videos of people fleeing villages as smoke rose from the site of strikes.\n\nTo understand the current conflict requires knowing the background of the dispute between Turkey and the Kurds, and how the United States fits into the dynamic.\n\nWho are the Kurds?\n\nThe Kurds are the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East. Despite their numbers, they are a stateless and often marginalized people whose homeland stretches across Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia.\n\nAfter World War I and the fall of the Ottoman Empire, many Kurds pushed for an independent Kurdish state, and promises were made in early treaties for the creation of a Kurdistan. But when the region was eventually divvied up, the nation never materialized.\n\nIn the years since, numerous attempts at nationhood have been largely quashed.\n\nHow does Turkey view the Kurds?\n\nRelations between the Turkish nation and the nationless Kurds have long been fraught.\n\nTurkey sees the rising power of Kurdish forces along its southern border as a threat, and Erdogan has for years made pronouncements of plans for a military intervention in the northern Syrian enclave.\n\nBut in fact, the roots of the dispute extend much further back, and they are intrinsically tied to a domestic conflict in Turkey.\n\nTurkey has been in conflict with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, known as the PKK, since it launched a violent separatist movement in the country in the early 1980s. Both Turkey and the United States consider the PKK a terrorist organization.\n\nAcross the border in Syria, an offshoot militia, the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, has been active since 2004. The militia, known as the YPG, has long sought to form an autonomous state for the Kurds.\n\nThe YPG and an associated militia of female fighters have been applauded by some in the West for their anti-Islamist stance. It has attracted a number of American and European volunteers to fight in its ranks during the battle against the Islamic State.\n\nBut the militia members have deep ties to the PKK, the Kurdish group that Turkey considers a terrorist organization, though its leaders play down the links.\n\nEarly in Syria\u2019s civil war, the militia had early success in establishing a peaceful enclave \u2014 they called it Rojava \u2014 in the north of the country.\n\nThe militia members eventually joined with other regional groups and grew into the SDF, which was instrumental in wresting large stretches of Syrian territory from the Islamic State, or ISIS, and ousting ISIS from its last foothold in Syria earlier this year.\n\nAs the SDF wrested back control of towns and cities across northeastern Syria from ISIS, Kurdish power grew. And as it did, Erdogan increasingly voiced concern.\n\nHow does the U.S. fit in?\n\nThe Turkish operation against the Kurds in Syria has left Washington stuck between two allies.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s announcement this week that he would be pulling troops from the country effectively greenlighted Turkey\u2019s incursion. Erdogan has long advocated a U.S. withdrawal from Syria and has urged Trump to pull his support from the SDF, most recently in a weekend phone call.\n\nThe United States and Turkey, which are NATO partners, have long been close allies.\n\nBut the Kurds and the United States also have a long history of cooperation.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition began working with the SDF in 2015, saying the Kurdish-led group was the most capable of pushing back the Islamic State militants who had seized large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria.
