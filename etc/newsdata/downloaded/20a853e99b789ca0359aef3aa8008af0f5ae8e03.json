The case involves a law firm, Seila Law, that refused to comply with a CFPB request for documents.\n\nThe firm challenged the agency's structure as unconstitutional, arguing that the bureau's director enjoys an illegal amount of independence from the president's executive branch authority.\n\nThe Trump administration and CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger have backed the challenge, which could transform or even dismantle the agency. Their support for the challenge has infuriated Democrats and the agency's allies.\n\nHouse Democrats urged the Supreme Court to reject Seila Law's appeal for a ruling, insisting that Congress did not infringe on separation of powers.\n\nI explain what this means for the future of the CFPB here.\n\nThe crux of the issue: The CFPB was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to police the financial sector for consumer fraud and abuse.\n\nDodd-Frank prevents the president for firing the CFPB director before his or her five-year term expires unless \"for cause,\" which is considered to be severe neglect or misconduct.\n\nSeila Law and the Trump administration argue that the \"for cause\" provision hinders the president's constitutional authority over the executive branch.\n\nA district court ruled in favor of the CFPB and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling, leading Seila Law to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nWhat happens next? We're not quite sure when the Supreme Court will hold arguments on this case, but the most likely outcomes are:\n\nThe court rules that the \"for cause\" provision is unconstitutional, but says it is up to Congress to fix it.\n\nThe court rules in favor of the CFPB, upholding its structure.\n\nThat said, the court could theoretically shut down the entire CFPB, but legal experts expect the court to take a more measured approach in line with Kavanaugh's opinion.\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\nWarren's surge brings new scrutiny to signature wealth tax: Sen.
