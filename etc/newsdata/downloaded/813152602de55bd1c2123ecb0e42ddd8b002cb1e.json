CLICK HERE to subscribe to the newsletter.\n\nTHE TOPLINE: President Trump Donald John TrumpGraham to introduce resolution condemning House impeachment inquiry Support for impeachment inches up in poll Fox News's Bret Baier calls Trump's attacks on media 'a problem' MORE announced Wednesday that his administration would lift sanctions on Turkey after Ankara agreed to stop an offensive in northern Syria and agreed to a permanent cease-fire.\n\n\"Earlier this morning, the government of Turkey informed my administration that they would be stopping combat and their offensive in Syria and making the cease-fire permanent,\" President Trump said in remarks from the Diplomatic Reception Room Wednesday morning.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump acknowledged the tenuous situation, adding: \"You would also define the word permanent in that part of the world as somewhat questionable. We all understand that. But I do believe it will be permanent.\"\n\nTrump said he has instructed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinOn The Money: Waters clashes with Trump officials over 'disastrous' housing finance plan | Dems jump into Trump turf war over student loans | House passes bill targeting anonymous shell companies Two new Trump executive orders will shape up Treasury and hold bureaucracy accountable Trump has floated Mnuchin, Conway for White House chief of staff: report MORE to lift sanctions on Turkey announced on Oct. 14, which targeted top officials and agencies in Ankara, as well as increasing tariffs.\n\n\"So the sanctions will be lifted unless something happens that we're not happy with,\" he said.\n\nTrump said that his administration would \"reserve the right\" to reimpose sanctions on Turkey, including increased steel tariffs, if Ankara falls short of its obligations, including protecting religious and ethnic minorities.\n\nTrump takes victory lap: The speech had the tone of a victory lap for Trump, even though he still faces widespread criticism for his withdrawal from Syria. He insisted he had kept his promises, arguing the U.S. had saved \"tens of thousands of Kurds\" in the short term alone.\n\nTrump dismissed the idea that the U.S. bears blame for any negative consequences, instead declaring that the newfound cease-fire was a product of his administration.\n\n\"This was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else. No other nation. Very simple,\" Trump said, flanked by Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoTrump hotel cancels Christian aid group's event to support the Kurds: report Pence on Syria: 'Our troops are coming home' House calls on Russia to release Paul Whelan or else provide evidence of wrongdoing MORE and national security adviser Robert O'Brien.\n\n\"We're willing to take blame and we're also willing to take credit,\" he added. \"This is something they've been trying to do for many, many decades.\"\n\nTrump vociferously defended his decision to pull U.S. troops from northern Syria and again asserted that the violent skirmishes between Turkish and Kurdish forces were necessary to get a cease-fire.\n\n\"Halting the incursion by military force would have required deploying tens of thousands of military troops against Turkey, a NATO ally,\" Trump said, cheering his \"good\" relationship with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\n\nTroop presence: Trump also confirmed he would leave a \"small number\" of U.S. troops in Syria near oil fields. He said the U.S. troops would be \"protecting\" the oil and \"deciding what we're going to do with it in the future.\"\n\nSpeaking later to reporters, a senior administration official would not specify the size of the residual force remaining in Syria but emphasized Trump's ultimate goal was to bring all U.S. troops home.\n\nWhat about the ISIS escapees: Trump said just a \"small number\" of ISIS prisoners have escaped, adding, without evidence, that they have been \"largely recaptured.\" He also said Kurdish Gen. Mazloum Kobani has assured him that prisoners remain under \"very, very strict lock and key.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperOvernight Defense: Trump's Syria envoy wasn't consulted on withdrawal | McConnell offers resolution urging Trump to rethink Syria | Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Hillicon Valley: Zuckerberg would support delaying Libra | More attorneys general join Facebook probe | Defense chief recuses from 'war cloud' contract | Senate GOP blocks two election security bills | FTC brings case against 'stalking' app developer Pentagon chief recusing himself from B 'war cloud' contract MORE said Tuesday in an interview with CNN that \"a little bit more than 100\" ISIS fighters have escaped, while special envoy James Jeffrey told a House panel Wednesday that \"we would say that the number is now over 100.\"\n\n\"We do not know where they are,\" Jeffrey added.\n\nHowever, the senior administration official, pointing to press reports, questioned where the number \"100\" came from on Wednesday, saying the U.S. had been assured by Turkey and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that the majority of ISIS fighters had been contained.\n\n\"My understanding and what we've been told by various parties in the region ... is that the SDF continues to hold the vast majority of the ISIS fighters that have been detained,\" the official said. \"It's obviously a fluid situation on the ground and we're monitoring it closely.\"\n\nYou don't have to go home, but you can't stay here: Questions remain about how the United States will continue its anti-ISIS campaign in Syria with most U.S. troops leaving.\n\nU.S. officials originally said the troops would move to western Iraq and conduct operations from there. But Iraqi officials, heeding the sensitivities of their constituencies at the appearance of a U.S. occupation, rejected that plan.\n\nAfter meeting with Esper on Wednesday, Iraqi officials said U.S. troops would have four weeks to stay in Iraq before they have to leave.\n\nCHAOS AT DEFENSE OFFICIAL'S IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY: House Republicans stormed a closed-door hearing Wednesday to protest Democrats' impeachment inquiry process, breaking up the deposition of a top Defense Department official who was testifying about Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n\n\"They crashed the party,\" said Rep. Harley Rouda Harley Edwin RoudaHere's what to watch this week on impeachment Testimony from GOP diplomat complicates Trump defense Ex-Trump aide on Russia testifies for 10 hours as part of impeachment inquiry MORE (D-Calif.), a member of the Oversight and Reform Committee, one of three House panels leading the impeachment probe.\n\nDozens of Republicans, including some members of leadership like House Minority Whip Steve Scalise Stephen (Steve) Joseph ScaliseMcCarthy on Trump's 'lynching' comparison: 'That's not the language I would use' House rejects GOP measure censuring Schiff This week: Tensions flare over Schiff, impeachment inquiry MORE (R-La.), barged into the secure hearing room in the Capitol basement where Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, was set to provide private testimony.\n\nFive hours later: Cooper's testimony finally started five hours after it was scheduled to begin.\n\nIt's unclear how the hours-long standoff was resolved.\n\nThe House Sergeant at Arms, Paul Irving, was seen going into the secure room around 2:30 p.m. But Democrats had rejected the idea that they would demand the physical removal of protesting Republicans, even as House rules stipulate that such depositions are limited to members of the relevant committees.\n\nCooper did not deliver opening remarks when her testimony finally began Wednesday afternoon, according to lawmakers in the room.\n\nInside the room: During the standoff, GOP Reps.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz Deborah (Debbie) Wasserman SchultzLawmakers from both sides of the aisle mourn Cummings DeLauro enters race to succeed Lowey as Appropriations chief Democrats walk tightrope in fight over Trump wall funds MORE (D-Fla.). She said the Democrats' impeachment probe has \"far too much fact for their comfort level, so they have to try to stop it from moving forward.\"\n\nWassermann Schultz said Cooper was not in the room at the time the Republicans entered. It's unclear, she added, what will happen next in terms of Cooper's testimony.\n\n\"It appears that they're refusing to leave,\" she said, referring to GOP lawmakers.\n\nCellphones: Some of the Republicans who barged into the hearing room were in possession of cellphones, a violation of the rules governing the so-called sensitive compartmented information facility, known as the SCIF, where the depositions have been taking place.\n\nSome Democrats were outraged by GOP lawmakers bringing cellphones and cameras into a secure room.\n\n\"In short they have compromised the security of the room. And they not only brought in their unauthorized devices, they may have brought in the Russians and Chinese with electronics in a secure space,\" Rep. Eric Swalwell Eric Michael SwalwellBill Press: Mulvaney proves need for daily briefings Mulvaney admission deals blow to White House impeachment defense Testimony from GOP diplomat complicates Trump defense MORE (D-Calif.) told reporters.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows Mark Randall MeadowsMulvaney faces uncertain future after public gaffes Testimony from GOP diplomat complicates Trump defense Obama: Cummings showed us 'the importance of checks and balances' MORE (R-N.C.), a member of the Oversight Committee and a key Trump supporter, suggested the concerns over the cellphones were overblown.\n\n\"There's no cameras or phones in the SCIF, so I think that those phones actually went in, just because everybody went in,\" Meadows told reporters. \"I can tell you I actually collected phones and brought them back out. You certainly want a secure environment but at the same time I think everybody wants to hear exactly what's going on.\"\n\nContext: The move by House Republicans comes a day after another witness, top diplomat William Taylor, testified that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country to conduct a pair of investigations -- one into 2016 election hacking, the other into the family of former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenSupport for impeachment inches up in poll Overnight Defense: Trump's Syria envoy wasn't consulted on withdrawal | McConnell offers resolution urging Trump to rethink Syria | Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Democrats say they have game changer on impeachment MORE -- that might have helped Trump's reelection campaign next year.\n\nScalise on Tuesday led more than 50 GOP members in a floor speech rally railing against impeachment efforts. The previous day, Trump called on Republicans to be more vocal in their defense of him as Democrats push forward with their impeachment efforts.\n\nREVELATIONS FROM MATTIS AIDE'S BOOK: Details are starting to come out from a book written by the former speechwriter for former Defense Secretary James Mattis James Norman MattisJohn Feehery: Mutiny on the Bounty Amash rips Trump over move to send troops from Syria to Iraq Defense chief says US troops leaving Syria will go to western Iraq MORE.\n\nRetired Navy Cmdr. Guy Snodgrass' book, \"Holding the Line: Inside Trump's Pentagon With Secretary Mattis,\" comes out next week, and reporters who got early copies are starting to write about it.\n\nAccording to a write up of the book in The Washington Post on Wednesday, Snodgrass wrote that Mattis said privately he'd \"rather swallow acid\" than watch the massive Fourth of July military parade that President Trump wanted.\n\nSnodgrass also wrote that Mattis felt \"iced out\" by the administration and used a disagreement last December over keeping U.S. troops in Syria as a \"pretext\" to resign, according to the Post.\n\nThe book also says that Trump wanted to \"screw\" Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos Jeffrey (Jeff) Preston BezosHillicon Valley: Facebook removes Russian, Iranian accounts trying to interfere in 2020 | Zuckerberg on public relations blitz | Uncertainty over Huawei ban one month out Amazon dumps million into Seattle elections Washington Post publisher: 'Corrosive' to liken unfavorable news to 'fake news' MORE by prohibiting Amazon from bidding on the Pentagon's $10 billion JEDI cloud network contract, a desire Mattis sought to stymie.\n\n\"We're not going to do that,\" Mattis reportedly told Pentagon officials. \"This will be done by the book, both legally and ethically.\"\n\nON TAP FOR TOMORROW\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper will speak at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels at 9:30 a.m. local time, or 3:30 a.m. Washington time.
