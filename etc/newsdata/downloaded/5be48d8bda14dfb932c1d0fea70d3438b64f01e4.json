If she was deported to Iran, \u201cthey will kill me,\u201d she said.\n\nMarkk Perete, undersecretary at the Philippine department of justice, said that \u201cthe only reason she was held at the airport - and we really don\u2019t call it detention - it is really restraining her from entering the Philippine territory, is only because of that Red Notice issued against her.\u201d\n\nHe added that the request had been made \u201cpresumably on account of a pending criminal case against her in Iran, and this case was filed by an Iranian national against her in relation to an assault that happened presumably here in the Philippines.\u201d", "description": "An Iranian beauty queen is seeking asylum in the Philippines, fearing for her life after Tehran demanded her extradition for a crime she claims she did not commit.", "authors": ["Nicola Smith", "Asia Correspondent", "Asa Bennett", "Tom Harris", "Eilis O'Hanlon"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/22/TELEMMGLPICT000213750743-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMG9jYnib85FJIfCc-bQYcY5qfRJwZg9W9F6qA0ytGtQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
