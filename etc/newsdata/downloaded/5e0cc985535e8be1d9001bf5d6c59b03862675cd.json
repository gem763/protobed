The survey found 11% undecided.\n\nThe purely hypothetical survey by the conservative-leaning pollster was described by HotAir.com as \u201chis favorite pollster seems to be throwing some shade his way.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome have speculated that if Joe Biden falters in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton will jump in. In a repeat matchup of the 2016 election, Clinton runs dead even with President Trump,\u201d Rasmussen wrote before going on to note that \u201ceven most Democrats don\u2019t want her to get into the race.\u201d\n\nRassmussen found that just 18% think that Mrs. Clinton should enter the race, just one-fourth the 71% share of likely voters who think she should not. But apparently, at least 27% of the electorate consists of people who don\u2019t think Mrs. Clinton should run but would vote for her if she did.\n\nMrs. Clinton has repeatedly ruled out a 2020 presidential bid, which would be her third.\n\nThe survey of 1,000 likely U.S. voters was taken from Thursday to Sunday and has an error margin of 3 percentage points.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
