I'm very excited. Coming into this, I really wanted to get a medal\" said Roxon.\n\n\"This place [London] has been very special in my career. In 2012, I came into those Games very nervous, I put a lot of pressure on myself, and I didn't perform at all like I wanted. So these Worlds were kind of my second chance to make things right, and to be able to stand on the podium tonight in this venue is very special.\"\n\nThe silver-winning performance also helped Roxon become the latest member of the 18-swimmer contingent to earn a nomination to represent Canada next summer in Tokyo.\n\nBronze-medal performance\n\nRoxon also contributed to Canada's second highlight of the night\u2014a bronze in the women's 4x100-m freestyle.\n\nAlong with teammates Abi Tripp of Kingston, Ont.; Aur\u00e9lie Rivard of St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que.; and Tess Routliffe of Caledon, Ont., the Canadians fended off a tough challenge from the Chinese to finish third with a time of four minutes, 30.09 seconds.\n\nWATCH | Canada finishes 3rd in the women's 4x100m freestyle:\n\nCanada finishes 3rd in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay with a time of 4:30.09. 8:18\n\nRoutliffe, who was competing in her first world championships, credited Rivard for getting the team into a winning position.\n\n\"Aur\u00e9lie just set me up perfectly. She caught up to everybody.\"\n\nGoing in third, Rivard overcame four rivals to put Canada in the lead at the 300-metre mark. Routliffe took it from there, holding off a furious charge from China in the final 50.\n\n\"I'm grateful that our coaches thought I could do this. It was an honour to be chosen as the anchor,\" said Routliffe.\n\nIt was Rivard's fifth medal of the week.
