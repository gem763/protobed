And nowhere is the divide as lopsided as in Iceland, where there are now two women in college for every man.\n\nThe reasons for this, its implications and the thorniness of dealing with it make this sparsely populated nation a laboratory for countries heading in the same direction \u2014 including the United States, where the number of women in higher education has also surpassed the number of men.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFifty years ago, 58 percent of U.S. college students were men. Today, 56 percent are women, Education Department estimates show. This year, for the first time, the share of college-educated women in the U.S. workforce passed the share of college-educated men, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that more women opt for college. It\u2019s that fewer men do, affecting their opportunities and lifetime earnings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crazy cycle,\u201d said Adrian Huerta, an assistant professor of education at the University of Southern California who focuses on college access and gender. \u201cWe know that when you have a college education, there are good outcomes with health. You\u2019re more likely to live longer. It matters for employment stability and civic engagement. You\u2019re less likely to rely on social services.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile still less than 3 percent, unemployment for men in Iceland is slightly higher than it is for women, the government agency Statistics Iceland reports.\n\nBut even in Iceland, the shrinking number of men in higher education has, until recently, attracted scant attention, said Eyjolfur Gudmundsson, rector of the University of Akureyri, where 77 percent of 2,389 undergraduates are women.\n\n\u201cWe are just now waking up and understanding that this is a problem,\u201d Gudmundsson said. \u201cThe world is waking up to it.\u201d\n\nYet some people still ask him why they should be concerned, Gudmundsson said.\n\n\u201cIt is of concern for the exact reason that we had concern 30 years ago about women not being represented in higher education in a fair way, or in the United States about ethnic groups and people of different backgrounds\u201d not going to college, he said he tells them.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a young male able to get a blue-collar type of a job with a decent wage [and not go to college], that means physical labor. What are you going to do when you\u2019re 50? What will be your opportunities then?\u201d\n\nThe trend also complicates efforts to fill jobs that require a college education. In the United States, it is worsening an already historic decline in university enrollment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not being discussed in the media,\u201d said Steinunn Gestsdottir, vice rector at the University of Iceland. \u201cBut policymakers are worried about this trend.\u201d\n\nThough there are slightly more men in Iceland than women, women earn more undergraduate and graduate degrees, including PhDs, according to the country\u2019s Directorate of Equality. Fifty-nine percent of women in the Reykjavik region have completed college, compared with 45 percent of men; outside the capital, the ratio is 40 percent to 19 percent.\n\nThe causes emerge in primary and secondary grades, with research showing that girls apply themselves earlier, whereas boys are more likely to drop out, impatient to begin earning money and unwilling to spend further years in school.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe boys want to have a car, but the girls want to think about their future,\u201d said Agnes Orradottir, a University of Iceland undergraduate.\n\nThere\u2019s a similar dynamic in the United States, Huerta said.\n\n\u201cYou have some teachers and counselors in rural and urban environments discouraging young men from going on to higher education \u2014 \u2018You\u2019re not college material, you should just go work,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nWhen the mismatch went the other way, there was a focus on pushing women to attend college. Even now, there are programs to nudge more women into traditionally male-dominated fields such as engineering and computer science, which threatens to push the gender ratio even further out of whack.\n\n\u201cWomen were told the reason you don\u2019t get paid the same is you don\u2019t have the education. So they went to university,\u201d said Katrin Olafsdottir, an economist at the University of Reykjavik who studies gender inequality. \u201cEveryone thought the men would be fine.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMale high school graduates have ample opportunities in Iceland to take decent-paying jobs in major industries such as fishing and construction work that seem to be underway everywhere, while female classmates choose professions such as nursing that require further education.\n\nThis division by gender in many professions is unusually pronounced in Iceland, known as a society that values equality, with a female prime minister, a law requiring employers to certify they pay male and female workers equally and a rule that at least 40 percent of corporate board members must be women.\n\nWhile men still predominate in engineering and computer science, they won\u2019t go into nursing; 98 percent of nurses here are women, at a time when the need for nurses is rising.\n\nAD\n\nWhen the nurses association announced last year that it would reimburse university registration fees for men who become nurses \u2014 about $605 a year, which is what students in Iceland pay for college \u2014 there were protests from women who questioned being excluded from getting the same incentive.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhy should I have to pay more [than a man]?\u201d University of Iceland student Claudia Magnusson asked.\n\nThis is not an issue only in Iceland. Women in China protested when universities made it harder for them to opt for certain majors in which they had begun to outnumber men.\n\nTo eliminate what the government calls \u201cextreme gender imbalance,\u201d universities in Scotland are working toward a 2030 target to make sure that no discipline has more than three-quarters of its students of one gender.\n\nAD\n\nThere are also shortages of teachers in Iceland, another job for which few men apply; at the University of Iceland, 91 percent of teaching students are women.\n\nThe teachers union, too, has tried to attract more men, but in this field, male role models may make the biggest difference. When the rock band that competed for Iceland in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2014 included two male preschool teachers, there was a brief increase in men who went into teaching.\n\nAD\n\nExperts say small steps like this may overcome stubborn stereotypes that channel men into some roles and women into others.\n\nIn fact, attitudes toward work have started changing \u2014 but more among women than men. At the University of Iceland, more women have begun to enter male-dominated disciplines such as electrical engineering.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat isn\u2019t happening is the other trend in the female-dominated departments,\u201d Gestsdottir said. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing men going into women-dominated subjects at the same rate. This is a very slow process.\u201d\n\nTo discourage dropouts, high school was shortened from four years to three, though the effect of this has been mixed. Many students and some observers say schools have simply crammed the same amount of teaching into less time, alienating already disaffected students.\n\nThose students are more often boys, said Ragnar Thor Snaeland, an undergraduate studying toward a law degree at the University of Iceland; he said he enrolled there because his parents, like most other parents in the Reykjavik suburb where he grew up, had gone to college and had expected him to go as well.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn the countryside or maybe places in eastern Iceland, I don\u2019t know if they have the same pressure there,\u201d said Snaeland as he took a study break on the small campus of tightly clustered and interconnected buildings.\n\nAt the University of Iceland, the student council president is a woman. So are the chairs of all nine of its committees.\n\nIn Magnusson\u2019s English major, there\u2019s one man among 25 women, she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t even hear from him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey tone down when there are more women,\u201d said Sandra Bjorg Ernudottir, who is studying ethnology, over nachos she was sharing with a friend at the campus bar.\n\nThere\u2019s no one way to bring the ratio back into balance, Gudmundsson said.\n\n\u201cSome of it will be positive discrimination. Some will simply be messaging. Some will be about thinking about jobs in a new way so both genders will see it in a new way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still just trying to understand the solutions, and I guess that\u2019s the same for the rest of the world.\u201d", "description": "In Iceland schools, an extreme example: Women outnumber men 2 to 1.", "authors": ["Jon Marcus"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7P9Hnc-P--K4BTnhKIuW20a4RN0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FZTR4UHXIYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
