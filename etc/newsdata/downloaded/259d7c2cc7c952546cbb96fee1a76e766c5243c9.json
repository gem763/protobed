All three major U.S. stock indexes closed Friday in the red, giving up earlier gains. President Donald Trump said there is no need for a trade deal with China before the 2020 election.

In today\u2019s After the Bell, we...\n\nSeptember Tranquility\n\nU.S. stocks ended Friday with losses as positive sentiment heading into the October U.S.-China trade talk turned sour again. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 159.72 points, or 0.59%, to close at 26,935.07. The S&P 500 has fallen 14.72 points, or 0.49%, to finish at 2992.07, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 65.21 points, or 0.80%, to close at 8117.67.\n\nPresident Trump said at a press conference on Friday that there is no need for a trade deal with China before the 2020 election and that he is not looking for a partial deal with Beijing, but something broader. It is not enough for China to just buy more agricultural products from the U.S., said the president. There has been speculation about a potential interim deal at the face-to-face meeting between the two countries planned for next month.\n\nChinese officials canceled a planned visit to farms in Montana next week. It was not immediately clear if the move was in response to President Trump\u2019s remarks, or if visits to other U.S. farm areas were also canceled.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nU.S. stocks dropped on the news, but both the Dow and the S&P 500 are sitting not far below their all-time highs.\n\nGlobal governments and central banks continued to come out with supportive policies in the face of a weakening economy. After the Central Bank of Brazil cut benchmark rates to a record low yesterday, People\u2019s Bank of China lowered its new benchmark lending rate for the second month in a row on Friday, and India reduced its corporate tax rate to one of the lowest in Asia. In a blog post today, Fed St. Louis President James Bullard wrote that U.S. manufacturing \u201calready appears in recession\u201d as many estimates of recession probabilities have risen from low to moderate levels.\n\nSo far, September\u2014historically known as one of the worst months for stocks\u2014turned out to be not so bad this year. The S&P 500 is up 2.2% for the month and was relatively stable for most trading days.\n\n\u201cOver the past two weeks we\u2019ve had the European Central Bank meeting, the Federal Reserve meeting, higher inflation, a historic jump in crude oil, Middle East turmoil, trouble in the repo market, and even multiple NFL quarterbacks sustaining major injuries,\u201d wrote LPL Financial senior market strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cYet, with all of those scary headlines, stocks are actually in the midst of one of the least volatile two-week stretches we\u2019ve seen in years.\u201d\n\nBut with the S&P 500 up near 3,000 points, the sea of tranquility might get rougher at any time, Detrick wrote on Friday. Investors should be on the lookout for the second half of September. On a historical basis, most of the weakness in September tends to come toward the end of the month. \u201cThings have been going well for equities in the face of some worrisome headlines, but don\u2019t get complacent, as the calendar could be one of the biggest near-term risks,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com", "description": "All three major U.S. stock indexes closed Friday in the red, giving up earlier gains.
