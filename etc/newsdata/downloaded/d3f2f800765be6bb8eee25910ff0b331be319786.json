This daring attack was claimed by the Houthis of Yemen but blamed on Iran by Saudi Arabia and the United States brought the Middle East to the brink of war. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in his initial statement held Iran responsible for the attack. President Donald Trump, while implying that Iran was the culprit, sent mixed messages. On the one hand, he declared that the United States is \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to retaliate for the attack. On the other, he stated that he would like to avoid war with Iran and would defer to the Saudis in making a decision about identifying the source of the attack.\n\nOn September 18, the Saudi defense ministry declared that the attack was \u201cunquestionably sponsored\u201d by Tehran and put on display the debris of drones and cruise missiles to demonstrate that they were of Iranian origin. A total of twenty-five drones and missiles were used in the strike launched, ministry spokesman Col. Turki al-Malki told a news conference. \u201cThe attack was launched from the north and unquestionably sponsored by Iran,\u201d he said, adding that Iranian delta-wing unmanned aerial vehicles were used in addition to cruise missiles. However, he went on to qualify his conclusion by saying that an investigation into where the attacks were launched from was still underway and the result would be announced at a later date. There has been no word since from Riyadh regarding the result of the investigation.\n\nNonetheless, most observers saw these attacks as an unprecedented escalation in the contest between Iran and Saudi Arabia for power and influence in the Middle East. They were also seen as a challenge to the United States by Iran since Washington is Riyadh\u2019s principal ally and Saudi Arabia\u2019s premier security prop. More important, the attacks appeared to be a part of the tit-for-tat moves that Washington and Tehran have made against each other since the United States announced its withdrawal from the JCPOA in May 2018 and the reimposition of draconian sanctions on Iran.\n\nIn retaliation Tehran has been gradually exceeding the limits it had accepted in the JCPOA on the level and quantity of uranium enrichment. The latest IAEA report issued on August 30 stated that Iran has accumulated 241.6 kilograms of enriched uranium and is enriching at the level of up to 4.5 percent. It had thus exceeded both a 202.8-kilogram limit on its enriched uranium stock and its 3.67 percent cap on the fissile purity to which it is allowed to refine uranium under the nuclear agreement.\n\nAlthough this is nowhere near the 20 percent mark that Iran had reached before signing the nuclear agreement, it was a clear signal that Tehran was willing to defy the limit imposed on it by the JCPOA unless the United States changed tack or the Europeans agreed to make up for the loss it suffered after its oil exports were cut off.\n\nSeveral incidents involving attacks on shipping in the Straits of Hormuz pointed toward Iranian complicity and a form of signaling that Iran would not hesitate to retaliate against American and allied facilities in the Middle East if it was attacked by the United States. The attack on the Saudi oil facilities fell within the same pattern although they were of a much graver nature. While the origins of the attacks may be a contested issue, it is clear that the weapons used were of Iranian make and that the Houthis or the Shia militia operating in Iraq could not have undertaken these attacks without the involvement of Iranian experts.\n\nHowever, this escalation seems to have produced unintended consequences. It seems Iran has been successful in sending the message that any attempt by the United States to attack Iran militarily would come at a great cost to the United States, then for its regional allies, in particular Saudi Arabia. This message was reinforced by the fact that while one heard a lot of bluster emanating from Washington the Trump administration failed to retaliate in concrete fashion for the attacks on the most sensitive Saudi targets.\n\nThis sequence of events has eroded the trust that the Saudis and other allies of the United States in the Persian Gulf had reposed in Washington that the latter will come to their aid if they felt their security was threatened. American inaction following the attacks on Saudi oil assets has sent the clear message that Trump does not intend to engage in another costly military involvement in the Middle East to provide security to its allies from their common foe, Iran. Furthermore, the message seems clear that the United States is unwilling to intervene militarily even to avert major global negative economic consequences such as disruption of oil supplies. Most observers in the Gulf perceive the American reluctance to act in the face of what they consider to be Iranian \u201cprovocations\u201d as a corollary of Trump\u2019s decision to keep the promise he made to the voters in 2016 to bring American soldiers back home. This interpretation has gained weight in light of the Trump administration\u2019s desperate attempts to find a face-saving formula through talks with the Taliban, so far considered to be international pariahs, to disengage from the Afghanistan imbroglio.", "description": "Saudi Arabia has been the kingpin of American strategy toward Iran.
