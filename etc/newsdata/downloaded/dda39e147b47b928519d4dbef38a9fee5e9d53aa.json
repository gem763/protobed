Illustration: Lauren Tamaki\n\nDoing the Most \ufeffis a special series about ambition \u2014 how we define it, harness it, and conquer it.\n\nAnanda Danielle Krettek is the founder and principal of the Google Empathy Lab \u2014 the mission of which, as she puts it, is to help Google create technology that works for our \u201cbeautifully real, messy human selves.\u201d Before that, she rose through the ranks on the design team at Apple, working under Steve Jobs. On any given day, her current job might involve creating new tools with Google\u2019s artificial intelligence team, talking to Bren\u00e9 Brown about vulnerability, or making a documentary film. (She recently worked with author and guru Ram Dass on new documentary called Becoming Nobody.) She lives in Los Angeles with her dog, Linus. Here\u2019s how she gets it done.\n\nOn her morning meditation routine:\n\nThere are basically two Danielles. There\u2019s one Danielle who, for periods of time, will get up at 6 a.m., meditate, and then swim or walk or wander. And that\u2019s when I feel like an exemplary human being. Like, I am doing it, yes! And then there\u2019s the other Danielle, which is far more often the case. She gets up about an hour later, and then lies under the thousand-pound duvet contemplating life with the dog, Linus, and being like, Let\u2019s just be lazy and pretend that\u2019s meditation.\n\nFor my actual meditation, I do a couple different things. Sometimes I sing, and sometimes I just try to sit in my apartment and get quiet. Or I\u2019ll walk down to the water in L.A. Or sometimes I just stay in bed. There\u2019s that funny thing that happens when you wake up in the morning, where for a brief moment you haven\u2019t remembered who you are yet, at the personality level. And I love that space. What I try to do with my meditation is prolong that state as much as possible. If I have that space of emptiness first thing in the morning, the day is always better. I\u2019m clearer, I have more grace, and the shitty version of me shows up later in the day.\n\nOn getting out the door in 15 minutes:\n\nEven though there\u2019s a lot of spaciousness in my morning routine, the actual getting ready for work and sitting down at the office only takes about 30 minutes from the end of my meditation. In terms of getting ready for work, I would love to pretend that it\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m so low maintenance and effortless.\u201d But really, I\u2019m lazy. I have long hair because I can just wash it and go. I probably take 15 minutes to get ready \u2014 it\u2019s just a quick shower, brush my hair, throw on mascara so that I look awake. And then I grab my dog, grab my laptop and my bag, and head out the door.\n\nOn inventing her own job:\n\nI did a lot of work for Nike when I was at the advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy, and that work eventually brought me to Apple, where I was for a very long time, under Steve Jobs during a real golden era of products. When Google brought me on, they actually didn\u2019t have a specific position for me because I was this oddly shaped thing. They were like, \u201cWell, let\u2019s let you find a role that is the shape you are.\u201d I started doing a lot of work for Creative Lab, and then I was at Google X for a while, where I started to chew on questions about the role of technology in our lives. And I started to build a framework for that, and the empathy lab grew out of it.\n\nOn managing stress at her job:\n\nMy job is still work. Google is still an office, and it\u2019s still a corporation, and we still have to do the hard thing and the boring thing and make tough decisions. What gets me through the hard and sticky stuff is feeling like what I\u2019m doing might actually help somebody. And not help with the big \u201cH\u201d \u2014 I mean help with things that make a person\u2019s morning suck a little less because one thing went really smoothly.\n\nOn being immersed in work:\n\nI went to Colorado College, where you study one thing really immersively for about three weeks and then take a five-day break. And that rhythm has stuck with me. I like to be deeply, intensively into something, to the degree where I\u2019m dreaming about it at night \u2014 eating, sleeping, and breathing it \u2014 for defined stints of time. It\u2019s like I have different modes. If I\u2019m in a research phase, I will be in very particular patterns, working kind of like Claire Danes in Homeland, stringing colorful paper on the wall, trying to figure stuff out. If I\u2019m in film mode, I\u2019m working with editing and looking at narratives that come forward. And when we\u2019re in product design, there\u2019s a lot of teamwork, a lot of meetings, a lot of whiteboarding. So whatever I\u2019m serving at the moment, I kind of shape-shift.\n\nOn how having a concussion taught her to prioritize:\n\nI had a concussion four years ago, and it taught me how to filter. For a little while afterwards, I would go to the grocery story and be like, Oh my God. 42 types of tomatoes. I can\u2019t deal. Or I\u2019d look at my device and I\u2019d immediately feel tired. I became very aware of my cognitive, emotional, and intentional load, and I still am. I hadn\u2019t been attuned to it before that because I didn\u2019t need to be. Now, I\u2019m able to notice when things feed me or drain me at a very subtle level. When I was younger, I used to be like, Oh, I should read this article because it\u2019s an important thing that smart people are reading. And now I\u2019m like, If I don\u2019t feel it, it\u2019s okay. There are plenty of other smart, thinking people that are going to do that instead. I allow myself to be interested in what I\u2019m interested in. Sometimes it\u2019s a documentary and sometimes it\u2019s a Pixar film. And sometimes it\u2019s trash television and US Weekly.\n\nOn dealing with her in-box:\n\nIn terms of my aesthetic vibe, I\u2019m an in-box-zero person \u2014 I\u2019m into Bauhaus, minimalist design \u2014 but I would be a crazy person if I tried to do that in reality. My practice with email is to not let it become the octopus that sucks out my brain and my will to be, because I hate it. It\u2019s so overwhelming. To manage the sheer weight of it, I label all the emails that come in with different colors. Things that are stressful to me, I put soothing colors on. Things that are exciting to me, I put hot colors on. So when I look at my email and see the gradient of emotion, I can recognize the feeling of my in-box without even having to read anything. That helps me be like, Well, I can handle this hot stuff right now. Or, Well, that\u2019s shit I don\u2019t want to do. I\u2019ll handle that when I have a little bit more time.\n\nOn dealing with anxiety:\n\nIf I\u2019m really stuck in my own mind and trying to process whatever I\u2019m neurotically obsessing about, it helps to get in the ocean. There\u2019s something about being in the water that washes me clean of all of my human bullshit. It\u2019s a reset button for me. That\u2019s my cheat. But if I\u2019m not in a place where I can do that, like if I\u2019m in New York, I go for a walk and try to tune into the rhythm around me, just to get outside of myself. In moments when I\u2019m stewing, it helps to tune into something else, which will usually carry me out of it.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s my dog, Linus. He\u2019s a magical healing creature. I rescued him here in L.A. 13 years ago, and he\u2019s now 14. He basically looks like a black-lab puppy, but he\u2019s got these Farrah Fawcett fringe ears. I think he\u2019s a beagle-cocker mix or lab-cocker mix. He is a wise soul.\n\nOn what motivates her:\n\nI don\u2019t identify as ambitious at all. Instead, I feel like I\u2019m this twirl of energy, and there\u2019s a creative force that comes through me. The creative process can feel like a super-neurotic shit show on a bad day. And it can feel like this beautiful, elegant, effortless, forming flow on a good day. The thing that really makes my heart beat is when someone tells me an intimate secret about themselves. People tend to do that with me. That\u2019s a sacred, precious thing.", "description": "Talking to Google Empathy Lab Founder Ananda Daneille Krettek about meditation, inventing her own job, and color coding her in-box according to stress level.", "authors": ["Charlotte Cowles"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/04/3-HIGID-Doing-the-Most-Anadada-Danielle-Krettek-feed-b.w1200.h630.jpg"}
