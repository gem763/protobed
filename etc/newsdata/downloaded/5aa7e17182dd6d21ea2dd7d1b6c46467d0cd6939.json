We made it. What a long, strange year it's been this week. (Evergreen, we know). Have a great weekend and we'll see you on Monday. Thanks for waking up with us.\n\nBeto O'Rourke made an impassioned and controversial case for gun control. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nThe Campaign\n\nJUST HOW FAR CAN GUN CONTROL GO AT THE BALLOT BOX?: \u201cHell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d Beto O'Rourke vowed on his home turf at the third Democratic presidential debate in Houston. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against a fellow American anymore.\u201d\n\nThe answer, received with thundering applause inside the room, was not what you might have expected from a former Texas lawmaker. But the Democrat has retooled his campaign (again), with a laser focus on guns in the wake of the shooting in El Paso, which is part of his former House district.\n\nTo this point, O'Rourke has been mired far into the second-tier of Democratic candidates. But his audacious gun buyback plan \u2014 which goes far further than his rivals \u2014 is a test of how far the rising issue of gun control will go at the ballot box and illustrates how the issue is changing the debate.\n\n\u201cSome politicians follow public opinion, some shape it. On guns tonight, Beto going all out to shape it,\u201d former Florida Congressman David Jolly tweeted.\n\nLegislative action on guns has been stalled for years \u2014 and continues to flounder as Trump waivers on expanding background checks \u2014 but outside activists and young people are coalescing around what appears to be an increasingly powerful issue in elections.\n\nDemocrats differed on just how far they would go to change gun laws in the wake of a summer of mass shootings:\n\nO'Rourke has proposed a mandatory buyback program, among other measures, and was also the first candidate to endorse the March for Our Lives gun-control program, \u201cA Peace Plan for a Safer America.\u201d\n\nhas proposed a mandatory buyback program, among other measures, and was also the first candidate to endorse the March for Our Lives gun-control program, \u201cA Peace Plan for a Safer America.\u201d Vice President Joe Biden defended his previous assertion that it's unconstitutional to eliminate assault weapons. \u201cLet's be constitutional. We've got a Constitution,\u201d he argued.\n\ndefended his previous assertion that it's unconstitutional to eliminate assault weapons. \u201cLet's be constitutional. We've got a Constitution,\u201d he argued. Sen. Kamala D. Harris. who has called for an executive order to implement background checks, chided Biden for his constitutional naysaying: \u201cWell, I mean, I would just say, hey, Joe, instead of saying, no, we can't, let's say yes, we can.\u201d\n\nwho has called for an executive order to implement background checks, chided Biden for his constitutional naysaying: \u201cWell, I mean, I would just say, hey, Joe, instead of saying, no, we can't, let's say yes, we can.\u201d \u201cAnd the idea that we would wait for this Congress, which has just done nothing, to act, is just \u2014 it is overlooking the fact that every day in America, our babies are going to school to have drills, elementary, middle and high school students, where they are learning about how they have to hide in a closet or crouch in a corner if there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school,\u201d Harris added.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said she thinks \u201cwe should start with a voluntary buyback program.\u201d\n\nsaid she thinks \u201cwe should start with a voluntary buyback program.\u201d Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) was pressed on how realistic his support for gun licensing is in a world where Democrats can't even pass universal background checks. He replied the issue of gun violence is \u201ca central issue to me,\u201d and that he wants to lead a movement on the issue.\n\nwas pressed on how realistic his support for gun licensing is in a world where Democrats can't even pass universal background checks. He replied the issue of gun violence is \u201ca central issue to me,\u201d and that he wants to lead a movement on the issue. \u201cWe must awaken a more courageous empathy in this country so that we stand together and fight together and overwhelm those Republicans who are not even representing their constituency. Because the majority of Americans, the majority of gun-owners agree with me, not the corporate gun lobby. It is time for a movement on this issue, and I will lead it,\u201d Booker added.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) discussed rolling back the Senate filibuster to get \u201canything done on guns\u201d: \u201cI was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster,\u201d she said onstage. \u201cUntil we attack the systemic problems, we can't get gun reform in this country.\u201d\n\ndiscussed rolling back the Senate filibuster to get \u201canything done on guns\u201d: \u201cI was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster,\u201d she said onstage. \u201cUntil we attack the systemic problems, we can't get gun reform in this country.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) doesn't support eliminating the filibuster but embraces \u201cpassing major legislation, the gun legislation people here are talking about.\u201d\n\nREMINDER: O'Rourke's plan is certainly pretty radical \u2014 at least compared to the current status quo \u2014 and risky politically. However, the latest polls do indicate that among Democrats especially, there's a chasm between public opinion and Congress on guns.\n\nPer The Post- ABC News poll that came out earlier this week, overwhelming majorities of Democrats support implementing \u201cred flag\u201d laws to disarm dangerous people, expanding background checks for all potential gun buyers, banning high-capacity ammunition clips with more than 10 bullets, banning the sale of assault weapons, and a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons for payment.\n\nBETO-MANIA FOR A NIGHT: O'Rourke's poised and passionate debate served as a reminder of the candidate that many Democrats first became enamored with during his failed 2018 Senate bid against Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.).\n\nIn the wake of the El Paso shooting, O'Rourke's raw and expletive-laden campaign has focused on curbing gun violence.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate told reporters after he was asked how Trump could make things better after the El Paso shooting. \u201cYou know the s--- that he\u2019s been saying. He\u2019s been calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. I don\u2019t know, like, members of the press: What the f---?\u201d\n\nTo kick off the debate, O'Rourke again called Trump out for his rhetoric: \" A racism and violence that had long been a part of America was welcomed out into the open and directed to my hometown of El Paso, Texas, where 22 people were killed, dozens more grievously injured by a man carrying a weapon he should never have been able to buy in the first place, inspired to kill by our president,\" O'Rourke said.\n\nHis \"Hell yes\" moment was followed by a viral riff on Warren's \"got a plan for that\" phrase:\n\nO'Rourke also last night called on credit card companies and banks \"to address gun violence by refusing to provide services for some firearms sales,\" reports the New York Times's Jacey Fortin.\n\n\"In a statement, Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign said he wanted the financial institutions to stop providing services for sales of assault-style weapons \u2014 or any firearms that are sold without background checks \u2014 and to stop doing business with manufacturers that produce assault-style weapons,\" per Fortin.\n\n\u201cHowever inadvertent or deliberate, credit card companies and banks profit off of those who terrorize our communities,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in an email to voters. \u201cAnd we know that in this moment, no one can sit on the sidelines. Everyone has a responsibility to do their part.\u201d\n\nDeath threats: After the debate, Briscoe Cain, a Republican Texas state legislator replied to O'Rourke's assault weapons buyback program on Twitter:\n\n\u201cMy AR is ready for you Robert Francis,\u201d Cain replied.\n\nThis is a death threat, Representative. Clearly, you shouldn't own an AR-15\u2014and neither should anyone else. pic.twitter.com/jsiZmwjMDs \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 13, 2019\n\nBeto's campaign reportedly referred the tweet to the FBI; and Twitter took down Cain's tweet for violating its policy.\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter. Not a regular subscriber?\n\nTHE TOP FIVE MOMENTS OF THE DEBATE: It was a weird one.\n\n1. Castro attacks Biden's memory: He went there. The question of whether Joe Biden has lost a step is whispered loudly and not so loudly by rivals. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro confronted it head on when he questioned Biden\u2019s memory during an exchange on health care.\n\nA number of Democrats said the attack was out of bounds: Former White House chief of staff Rahm Emmanuel said \u201cit was a disqualifier how he handled it.\u201d Fellow presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar said it was akin to \u201csomething like Donald Trump would tweet.\u201d And former White House senior adviser David Axelrod said \u201cit was personal to the point of being off putting.\u201d\n\nFormer White House chief of staff Rahm Emmanuel said \u201cit was a disqualifier how he handled it.\u201d Fellow presidential candidate Sen.

O, the love is in the air: They might not be singing \u201cCome back, Barack,\u201d but the candidates onstage clearly took note of concerns that the last debate was too harsh on President Obama\u2019s legacy by heaping praise on his tenure.\n\n3. Buttigieg talks about his coming out: Asked to describe the most significant professional setback he's faced, here's what the mayor said:\n\nTo bring about a better future, we have to know what we\u2019re about. This election is not about anyone running for office, it\u2019s about making things better for the people who trust us with their lives. Together, we will win a better era for our country. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/tii4Waj5MY \u2014 Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) September 13, 2019\n\n4. Yang promises free money: Entrepreneur Andrew Yang vowed to make history on Thursday night. He did not disappoint. In his opening statement, he promised to use campaign money to pay 10 adults $1,000 a month for the next year --- a test of his core universal basic income policy. However, there are questions on whether his sweepstakes-esque move would be legal.\n\n5. The dad jokes and one-liners: Yes, we canned. Starting out with Sen. Amy Klobuchar dropping \u201cHouston, we have a problem\u201d in her intro and continuing throughout the night a number of candidates tried their best to be the next comedian-in-chief. Some might want to stick to their day jobs.\n\nHarris compares Trump to the Wizard: \u201cBut the bottom line is this: Donald Trump, in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that guy in 'The Wizard of Oz,' when you pull back the curtain, it's a really small dude?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the bottom line is this: Donald Trump, in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that guy in 'The Wizard of Oz,' when you pull back the curtain, it's a really small dude?\u201d \u2026 And she also trotted out Obama\u2019s old slogan: \u201cI would just say: Hey Joe, instead of saying no, we can't, let's say yes, we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would just say: Hey Joe, instead of saying no, we can't, let's say yes, we can.\u201d Booker makes a bald joke: \u201cI'm the only person on this stage that finds Trudeau's hair very menacing, but they are not a national security threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm the only person on this stage that finds Trudeau's hair very menacing, but they are not a national security threat.\u201d And also has some hard feelings about penguins: \u201cAnd here's a bit of advice to everybody. If you're going to have a spectacular failure, have a documentary team there to capture it, because it made for an Oscar-nominated documentary called \u201cStreet Fight.\u201d But then, unfortunately, another setback. It lost in the Oscars to a movie called \u2018March of the Dagnab Penguins,\u2019 for crying out loud.\u201d\n\nLiterally LOLed at the hotel internet password for the GOP retreat-> pic.twitter.com/5AACL9l6u1 \u2014 Rachael Bade (@rachaelmbade) September 12, 2019\n\nAt The White House\n\nMEANWHILE IN BALTIMORE: Trump kicked off the House Republicans policy retreat just as the debate got started in the same city he trashed as a \u201crodent infested mess.\u201d\n\nTrump was fixated on his usual targets: Hillary Clinton, the media and the Democratic presidential candidates throughout a 70-minute speech. My colleagues Rachael Bade and Paul Kane were there.\n\n\u201cFor the first half-hour, Trump\u2019s speech slowly moved along at the pace of a State of the Union address. He ticked through what he considered GOP accomplishments \u2014 slashing thousands of rules, including the decision Thursday to scrap the Obama-era regulation on the wetlands and tributaries that feed into the nation\u2019s largest rivers \u2014 and through tax cuts,\u201d they report.\n\n\u201cTrump became more animated later on, going off script to rant about Democrats wanting to take away plastic straws and what he called their outrageous demands for how to recycle lightbulbs.\u201d\n\nTrump notably did not mention gun control, instead saying that \u201cRepublicans will always uphold fundamental rights to keep and bear arms.\u201d\n\nThe freshly elected North Carolina congressman, Rep.-elect Dan Bishop, was also preseent and provided his assessment of the electorate to the group:\n\n\u201cWhat I heard more than anything else from voters as I passed them in the district is that what the social Democratic Party is articulating not only stuns them, it frightens them \u2014 not only on the subject of being consumed with the idea of destroying this president . . . but also their policy proposals, which are outlandish,\" per Rachael and P.K.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.). (Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nThe Investigations\n\nDEMS MOVE FORWARD ON IMPEACHMENT: Or did they? \"Bristling over the \u201cI\u2033 word, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stopped short Thursday of saying the House is ready to launch an impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump, even as Judiciary Committee Democrats set the stage to do just that,\" the Associated Press's Mary Clare Jalonick and Lisa Mascaro report. \"By approving ground rules for impeachment hearings Thursday, the Judiciary Committee sparked the questions anew.\"\n\nWhat the Judiciary Committee is doing: \" ... Chairman Jerrold Nadler says there\u2019s no uncertainty about what his committee is doing: It\u2019s an impeachment investigation, no matter how you want to phrase it,\" Jalonick and Mascaro write. \"As the committee voted Thursday to approve guidelines for impeachment hearings, Nadler promised an 'aggressive' fall schedule, starting with next week\u2019s public session with Trump aide Corey Lewandowski.\"\n\n\" ...

Some call it an impeachment investigation,\" he said at the beginning of the hearing. \"There is no legal difference between these terms, and I no longer care to argue about the nomenclature. But let me clear up any remaining doubt: The conduct under investigation poses a threat to our democracy. We have an obligation to respond to this threat. And we are doing so.\u201d\n\nBut let me clear up any remaining doubt: The conduct under investigation poses a threat to our democracy. We have an obligation to respond to this threat. And we are doing so.\u201d One voice could change the debate: \"Rep. John Lewis has called Donald Trump an illegitimate leader and boycotted his inauguration, but he's remained conspicuously silent on demands for the president's impeachment,\" Politico's Kyle Cheney and Heather Caygle report. \"Despite his silence, advocates for Trump's removal see the civil rights icon \u2014 a man Democrats describe as the conscience of their caucus \u2014 as a singularly powerful potential ally, one of the last publicly undecided lawmakers who could change the calculus inside the Democratic caucus. And Lewis himself says an announcement on impeachment is almost at hand.\"\n\nThe Takeaway: This week has provided the strongest examples yet of how we are in the midst Schr\u00f6dinger's impeachment. The question now is just how long congressional Democrats can go without opening the box.\n\nMarianne Williamson Materializes On Stage In Cloud Of Purple Smoke With Message That DNC Polling Requirements No Match For Power Of Positive Thinking https://t.co/zmIzrO60wk #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/oxyAyLQetu \u2014 The Onion (@TheOnion) September 13, 2019\n\nIn the Media\n\nWEEKEND READS:", "description": "Will Democratic voters follow?", "authors": ["Jacqueline Alemany", "Anchor Of Power Up", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/a48eb0d8e6d383133e2b74214bbdf965-3273-2183-70-8-K6HOUOWVYUI6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
