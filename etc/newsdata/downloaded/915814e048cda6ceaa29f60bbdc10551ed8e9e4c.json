Big problems at St Mary\u2019s\n\nLeicester were excellent on Friday night \u2013 ruthless and clinical in attack and fluid in their build-up play \u2013 but that did little to mitigate Southampton\u2019s dismal performance.\n\nA 9-0 defeat \u2013 equalling the 24-year record in the Premier League \u2013 sent Southampton into the relegation zone and piled the pressure on manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, who now has a sizeable task on his hands to turn this around.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

There were a few thousand forlorn Southampton fans remaining by the end, left wondering what the future holds for the club.\n\nIf something doesn\u2019t change soon, relegation looks a real possibility.\n\n2. City motor on despite unconvincing display\n\nManchester City, as Pep Guardiola pointed out, were nowhere near their fluent best in the first half of Saturday\u2019s 3-0 win over Aston Villa.\n\n\u201cIf we play like we did in the first half we will be relegated,\u201d he said. Clearly, then, Guardiola was not impressed. City were restricted well by a stubborn Villa side and looked uneasy at the back, too, where more problems have arisen following the sending off of Fernandinho late on.\n\nThere was a transformation after the break, though. It took only a few seconds for Raheem Sterling to put the hosts in front and from then on the game escaped Villa. The fluid interchanges in the final third, the dominance in possession and constant pressing off the ball returned, and City eased to victory.\n\nThe Premier League champions remain on the tails of leaders Liverpool, and their ability to flick the switch and take the game away from opposition, even when not at their best, will worry Jurgen Klopp and his players after being hunted down last season.\n\n3. Silva\u2019s Everton woes continue\n\nMarco Silva would have been relieved last week when his side ended a run of four successive league defeats to beat West Ham at Goodison Park. It felt like a crucial three points, a win that perhaps, in the short term at least, saved the Portuguese\u2019s job.\n\nBut it has been almost forgotten in the wake of Saturday\u2019s game, a 3-2 defeat at Brighton that will have hurt everyone associated with the club. Everton twice led at the Amex Stadium, but a Neal Maupay penalty with ten minutes remaining and then an injury-time own goal from Lucas Digne consigned the visitors to another defeat.\n\nThe Toffees have yet to win away from home in the Premier League this season. They sit in 16th place, just two points above the relegation zone. And time is probably running out for Silva.\n\n4. Pulisic ready to play key role at Chelsea\n\nIt has been a relatively slow start at Chelsea for Christian Pulisic, who arrived from Borussia Dortmund with great expectations and enjoyed a pre-season that suggested he would slot in seamlessly at Stamford Bridge.\n\nBut he has been on the periphery for the opening weeks of the season, restricted to just three league starts prior to Saturday\u2019s trip to Burnley.\n\nAnd this was his first start since August. Pulisic was clearly eager to impress, driving a low finish into the bottom corner early in the first half before adding two more goals to complete a clinical \u2018perfect\u2019 hat-trick.\n\nChelsea have not been short of goals this season, but an in-form Pulisic could take Frank Lampard\u2019s side to another level.\n\n5. Impressive Sheffield United maintain strong start\n\nChris Wilder\u2019s side do not look overawed by the top flight. In fact, they look comfortable, capable perhaps of finishing in the top half of the Premier League table.\n\nThat is no mean feat for a newly promoted team, especially one with a relatively modest budget.\n\nSheffield United, on Saturday, backed up last week\u2019s hard-fought 1-0 win over Arsenal with a valuable point at West Ham, with Lys Mousset scoring his second goal in two games.\n\nIt leaves the Blades in seventh, with a foundation to build on. Ten games into the season is far too early to come to any conclusions, but the signs are positive for Sheffield United.\n\n6. Dubravka errors cost Newcastle\n\nIt looked, for a long time, like Newcastle would grind out a narrow victory over Wolves. They led late in the first half through Jamaal Lascelles and battled hard to keep the visitors at bay.\n\nBut a mistake from Martin Dubravka, of which there have been far too many in the last year, cost Steve Bruce\u2019s side two points. According to Opta, only Asmir Begovic has made more errors leading to goals than Dubravka\u2019s six since the latter made his debut in February 2018.\n\nIf Newcastle are to avoid the drop this season, they will need more consistent performances from their goalkeeper.\n\n7. Liverpool grind out another win\n\nLiverpool, despite having won nine of ten games this season, have not always eased to victory. They have had to battle to wins, to grind down their opposition.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Liverpool vs Tottenham player ratings Show all 23 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

The Reds fell behind almost immediately, but had the confidence and strength of character to turn the scoreline around.\n\nIt is another narrow victory, another victory by a margin of just one goal, but that will not concern Klopp. Liverpool seem to have winning down to a fine art.\n\n8. Xhaka the scapegoat at Arsenal\n\nGranit Xhaka is a divisive figure at Arsenal. He is the club captain, a technically-gifted midfielder capable of producing moments of brilliance.\n\nBut he is too often wild and erratic, too often anonymous when Arsenal need a leader. The reaction from the home supporters when he was withdrawn was one of contempt, and that is concerning for everyone at the club.\n\nIt is a sign of a growing feeling of uneasiness at Arsenal. The season so far has not been disastrous, but the club\u2019s fans expect far more than they are getting.\n\n9. Rashford and Martial inspire United to welcome away win\n\nUnited had not won away from home in the Premier League since February, an alarming stat for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nBut there were signs of real improvement at Norwich as Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford both scored \u2013 and both missed penalties \u2013 in a convincing victory.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

With Martial back, though, and Rashford returning to form, they are more direct in attack, a more focused threat.\n\nThis could be the start of a climb up the table for Solskjaer\u2019s side.\n\n10. Toothless Watford remain winless\n\nQuique Sanchez Flores appears to have addressed some of Watford\u2019s defensive issues \u2013 the Hornets have only conceded three goals in their last four league games after letting in eight at Manchester City \u2013 but the more pressing concern now is at the other end of the pitch.\n\nWatford, despite a couple of chances, could not find a way through against Bournemouth and remain without a win, rooted to the bottom of the table on five points.\n\nFlores needs to find some balance if he is to guide his side towards safety.", "description": "1.
