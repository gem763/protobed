Masked youths have hurled stones at security forces, who have responded with teargas and water cannons.\n\n\u201cOur flag is red, like the blood of the working class!\u201d chanted marchers in downtown Quito, where anti-Moreno and anti-IMF graffiti covered walls.\n\n\u201cMoreno out!\u201d and \u201cPolice murderers!\u201d some shouted.\n\nAuthorities have arrested nearly 700 people in a week of unrest, and dozens of police officers have been injured.\n\nMoreno has accused his former friend, mentor and boss Correa of seeking a coup with the help of his fellow socialist President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela.\n\nMoreno served as Correa\u2019s vice-president during his decade-long rule, but broke with him after winning election and moved economic policies to the right.\n\nFrom Belgium where he lives, Correa has been applauding the demonstrators but scoffed at accusations of seeking a coup. Maduro, himself immersed in economic crisis in Venezuela, also denied involvement in Ecuador.\n\nMoreno has support from the business elite and the military appears to remain loyal, but his popularity is less than half of what it was two years ago and Ecuadoreans are mindful that indigenous protests helped topple three presidents before Correa.\n\n\u201cI feel betrayed by Moreno,\u201d said printer and father of eight Luis Calvopina, 53. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to quit, but I do want him to reverse this stupidity that he has done.\u201d", "description": "Security forces fired teargas to break up hundreds of protesters marching in Quito against president\u2019s austerity measures", "authors": ["Reuters In Quito"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fa2aeb2b0a031daaf36a183b2308e1838e0554d/0_165_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c3b2c3e7c045230bb1b97fa5f5fdfaa", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
