'Anaerobic' means the bacteria doesn\u2019t need any oxygen to survive or grow.\n\nThis disrupts the balance of natural chemicals in the vagina, which may not be obvious is symptoms don't appear.\n\nThe condition is very common. Figures suggest it affects up to one in three women at some point in their life.\n\nWHAT IS BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS? Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge. It affects around one in three women at some point in their lives. Although it is not an STI, it does increase a woman's risk of catching a sexually-transmitted infection. BV is caused by a change to the delicate bacterial balance in a woman's vagina. The most common symptom is a fishy-smelling discharge, particularly after sex. There may also be a change to the discharge's colour or texture, such as it becoming grey or watery. But half of women with BV experience no symptoms. If a woman suspects she has BV, she should go to her GP or sexual-health clinic to confirm it is not an STI. Once diagnosed - via a cotton bud 'smear' - BV is usually treated via prescribed antibiotic tablets, or gels or creams. BV often returns within three months. Those who get it more than twice in six months will need treatment for up to half-a-year. BV can be prevented by using just water to wash the genital area and opting for showers over baths. Perfumed soaps, vaginal deodorants, douches, strong detergents and even smoking raise a woman's risk of the condition. BV is more common in those who are sexually active, have recently changed their partner or have 'the coil'. If 'caught' during pregnancy, BV can lead to a premature birth or miscarriage. Worried pregnant women should speak to their GP or midwife. Source: NHS Choices\n\nTreating bacterial vaginosis can become a vicious cycle. Antibiotics can kill off vital bacteria, or cause resistance.\n\nThe condition also often comes back, leaving affected women on a continuous cycle of antibiotics to try and keep the symptoms under control.\n\nMore than half of women successfully treated with BV find their symptoms return, usually within three months.\n\nHadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center experts recruited five women, aged 27 to 47. All had suffered from BV four or more times in the past year.\n\nThey had attempted to rid their symptoms with a range of antibiotics for prolonged periods of time, according to the findings published in the journal Nature.\n\nAll patients, who were only named as A, B, C, D and E, revealed BV had a significant negative impact on their life.\n\nThey spoke of how it had 'devastating consequences' to their relationships, sex lives and self-esteem.\n\nThree donor women were recruited, aged between 35 and 48, who had not been affected by BV in the five years before the study.\n\nDuring the procedure, vaginal fluid was collected using a spatula.\n\nThe collected discharge was evaluated to make sure the pH was in balance before being stored in below freezing temperatures (-80\u00b0C/-112\u00b0F).\n\nThe BV patients were treated with a weeks-worth of antibiotics prior to the transfer.\n\nThen the donor's sample was placed above the cervix - the neck of the womb - in a procedure taking less than an hour.\n\nA few rules were in place to ensure maximum success, such as no sex for a month and no douching for a week, as both can disrupt the vagina pH.\n\nVMTs were repeated if symptoms came back, as the BV patients were followed up weekly and then monthly.\n\nFour patients had long lasting improvements. Two patients received one VMT and saw improvements one week after transfer. They stayed in remission for 5.5 and 11.5 months.\n\nThe other two patients needed three VMTs, with long-term remission lasting four 11 months in one patient and 21 one months in another.\n\nThe fifth patient only had partial remission. The authors noted that she needed to take antibiotics for pharyngitis four weeks after VMT, at which point BV flared up again.\n\nRemission was measured as having a Lactobacillus-dominated microbiome, disappearance of symptoms, and a lower Amsel score.\n\nThe Amsel score includes four criteria - the presence of a grey, watery discharge, pH of the vagina being more than 4.5, a fishy odour before or after the addition of hydroxide - called the whiff test - and the presence of clue cells under the microscope.\n\nAccording to Amsel, if three of four criteria are positive, the patient has BV.\n\nThe authors said VMT is feasible to a long-term treatment, especially as there were not side effects reported.\n\nThey added that there needs to be further trials which use a placebo for comparison.\n\nDoctors at John Hopkins University in Baltimore have been given the go-ahead to do such a trial by the Food and Drug Administration.", "description": "Results of the trial in Israel showed the  transplant successfully treated four of women with severe bacterial vaginosis, leaving them in remission for up to 21 months.", "authors": ["Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19403528-0-image-a-4_1570463853370.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
