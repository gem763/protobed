I was a lot slimmer - though I was still big - but I realised I wasn\u2019t a better person, I wasn\u2019t suddenly beautiful, I wasn\u2019t suddenly amazing. I was still the same person, but a lot less happy.\n\nI was bullied a lot throughout my school years, and I hated my body - absolutely hated it. It really affected my mental health.\n\nWhen I was 10, I was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid, so each year I\u2019ve put on more weight. I was always really active, so it was strange. New lumps and bumps formed that I didn\u2019t know what to do with.\n\nBut one night someone commented on all of my pictures saying that I was fat and looked like someone from Star Wars.\n\nI messaged her and asked her why she was doing it. Why she found it fun to hurt someone like that. She replied, and later admitted that she had hang-ups about her own body. She said she felt fat.\n\nIt made me think that often people are just pushing their own insecurities out. Someone will look at me and think: \u2018I don\u2019t want to be that size, I wouldn\u2019t be happy that size, so why should you be happy when you\u2019re fat?\u2019\n\nIt makes me sad to think about people who are struggling so much that they think the only way to make themselves feel better is to put someone down. That\u2019s not the way. You can\u2019t be comparing yourself to other people.\n\nI know it\u2019s not easy, but the sooner you start to see yourself, how great you are, the better. You won\u2019t need to judge someone by their looks.\u201d", "description": "Six women talk about body positivity and their fat activism", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/vj/live/idt-images/shorthand-why_we_are_proud_of_our_fat_bodies/COVER-IMAGE-FB_mr9lb.jpg"}
