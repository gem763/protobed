We're in a world cup final and this is all you want to talk about.'\n\nMatthew Le Tissier has offered a withering appraisal of his old side's 9-0 defeat to Leicester\n\nThe legendary midfielder was at a rain-soaked St Mary's Stadium to witness the dismal defeat\n\nSoccer Saturday presenter Jeff Stelling wasted little time in quizzing Le Tissier about the game\n\nQuick-witted Stelling, who has a strong rapport with Le Tissier on the long-running scores update show, sent fellow guests Clinton Morrison, Paul Merson and Charlie Nicholas into hysterics by quipping: 'The interesting thing there is that Leicester scored more than the All Blacks.'\n\nAny comfort Le Tissier might have derived from England's sensational Rugby World Cup victory over New Zealand on Saturday morning subsided as the man who played an immaculate chip over Peter Schmeichel in October 1996 reflected on his club's predicament.\n\nAsked to describe the disastrous defeat that dropped Southampton into the Premier League relegation zone, Le Tissier rued: 'A total capitulation - a lack of any leaders or courage on the football pitch. And I also have to say a little bit of lack of organisation as well after going down to ten men.'\n\nThose words will be nothing new to Saints boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, who could be set for the sack following an opening to the season that has seen his side win only two of their first ten matches.\n\nLe Tissier attempted to change the conversation to talk about England's Rugby World Cup win\n\nThe pundit was soon chuckling as Stelling made mention of New Zealand's semi-final defeat\n\n(Left to right) Le Tissier, Paul Merson, Clinton Morrison and Charlie Nicholas saw the funny side\n\nTweeting on the night, Le Tissier asked Stelling if he could be excused from broadcasting duties in anticipation of the kind of humiliation that was swiftly wielded once the cameras rolled in the studio.\n\nLe Tissier was in his prime and on his way to a 20-goal season on the only other occasion a side has lost by nine goals in a Premier League match, when United beat Ipswich 9-0 at Old Trafford in March 1995.\n\nA thrashing was not entirely unexpected for Ipswich, who were visiting the champions and would finish bottom of the table by a distance. Southampton's home mauling on Friday, though, was a mortifying shock for a club who are expected to comfortably avoid relegation this season.\n\nWriting in the aftermath of full-time, Le Tissier said: 'Not sure if I've just witnessed an amazing performance or a completely abject one!\n\n'I suspect a bit of both. Well played Leicester City - ruthlessly professional.'\n\nPlease please please \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc I\u2019m feeling really \ud83e\udd2e https://t.co/b5WILbnZ0O \u2014 Matt Le Tissier (@mattletiss7) October 25, 2019\n\nResponding to his remarks, some of Le Tissier's following of more than 500,000 agreed with his sentiments and fondly reflected on his famous goal at former stadium The Dell.\n\nOne wrote: 'I sincerely hope the media team [at Southampton] resist posting any \"on this day\" clips reminding us what a great team we used to be.\n\n'The model is broken. We used to mix players of potential with 1st team players, now all we have left is just potential.\"\n\nSouthampton are seven goals behind fourth-bottom Newcastle because of the defeat and have played a game more than second-bottom Norwich, who are a point behind them. They are four points clear of Watford, who started the day bottom.\n\nLe Tissier became known for wonderful goals during his Saints spell between 1986 and 2002\n\nSouthampton's Ralph Hasenhuttl took responsibility for arguably the club's worst ever result\n\nBeleaguered Saints travel to Manchester City twice in the next week - first for an EFL Cup tie on Tuesday, then for a Premier League match next Saturday.\n\nSpeaking after the rout, Hasenhuttl admitted: 'It was not easy to watch for anybody who is following us and for anybody is a Southampton fan.\n\n'They did quite well to stay until the end and stay with us. We have to apologise for what happened today and stand up again.'", "description": "Le Tissier offered a suitably grumpy reaction when the pundit was swiftly teased by Soccer Saturday presenter Jeff Stelling following Southampton's Friday night defeat to Leicester.", "authors": ["Ben Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/14/20217192-0-image-a-29_1572097335654.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
