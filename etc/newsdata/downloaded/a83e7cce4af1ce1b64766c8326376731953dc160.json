In the months that followed, no action was taken against Halkbank for its alleged involvement in a massive scheme to evade sanctions on Iran. That changed when an undated indictment was unveiled Tuesday -- a day after Trump imposed sanctions over Turkey\u2019s military operation in northern Syria.\n\nIt marked an unusual intervention by a president to get his top cabinet officials involved in an active federal investigation. It\u2019s not clear whether Trump instructed Barr and Mnuchin to satisfy Erdogan\u2019s pleas or whether the president was simply tired of being asked about it.\n\nBut according to a third person who\u2019s familiar with Turkey\u2019s position, discussions over a deal that would resolve the issue out of court made little headway before Barr took over as attorney general in February and then became involved in the discussions.\n\nOver the summer, the White House sought to stop Erdogan and his aides from pestering Trump on the matter, according to a person who was briefed on a number of phone calls that took place and asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. In June, the person said, then-National Security Advisor John Bolton told a Turkish official, Ibrahim Kalin, that Trump wouldn\u2019t engage on the issue directly after delegating it and that Turkish officials should stop raising it with the president.\n\nIn a call at about the same time, Barr told his Turkish counterpart, Abdulhamit Gul, that he needed to reach a deal with the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, where the case was under consideration, or it would go to trial. He said Turkey\u2019s best option would be to accept a deferred prosecution agreement under which Halkbank would pay a fine and take steps to avoid further wrongdoing.\n\nAfter months of negotiations, Turkish officials ultimately refused because they believed doing so would constitute an admission of guilt, according to the person. A second person familiar with the discussions confirmed that Turkey refused to accept the deal but said there had been progress toward a resolution.\n\nPresident\u2019s Priority\n\nTrump\u2019s involvement and his decision to assign Barr and Mnuchin to address the sensitive issue, working with Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, reflected the degree to which the Halkbank case became a priority for the president.\n\nIn the end, U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against Halkbank, accusing it of fraud, money laundering and violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. It\u2019s unclear exactly when the Halkbank indictment was filed, raising questions about whether it was set aside until it became politically expedient for the Trump administration to unseal it.\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t have advance notice there was an indictment against the bank or when it was going to be unsealed, according to an administration official.\n\nJustice Department officials declined to comment when asked about Barr\u2019s efforts, and the Treasury Department declined to comment on Mnuchin\u2019s role. The White House declined to comment, and the State Department declined to discuss the part Pompeo played. Bolton declined to comment.\n\nThe politically explosive indictment came as Turkish-U.S. tensions are soaring over Turkey\u2019s military offensive in Syria after Trump\u2019s withdrawal of American forces from key border posts last week. On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence and Pompeo were due to travel to Ankara for talks with Erdogan over the conflict in Syria.\n\nThe charges against Halkbank also come after years of public and private lobbying by Erdogan and other top Turkish officials -- starting in the Obama administration -- to get the investigations into violations of Iran sanctions dropped.\n\nThe matter is the latest instance linked to Turkey in which Trump has pressed for a solution beyond the bounds of the courtroom. In multiple meetings in 2017, Trump urged then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to persuade the Justice Department to drop the case against Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader at the center of the scheme to violate the sanctions.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump assigned his attorney general and Treasury secretary to deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s repeated pleas to avoid charges against one of Turkey\u2019s largest banks, according to two people familiar with the matter.In an April phone call, Trump told Erdogan", "authors": ["Nick Wadhams", "Jennifer Jacobs", "Saleha Mohsin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
