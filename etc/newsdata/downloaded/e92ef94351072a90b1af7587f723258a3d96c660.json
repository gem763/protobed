They are beautiful, easy to clean and very versatile - you can bake bread in them, saute, braise, bake and cook on the stovetop with them. I like that even after cooking something that potentially could be very hard to clean, the mess washes away easily. Often, I will 'soak' the pot overnight before cleaning: I put a small amount of water in the dirty pot, put the lid back on, and the next day it will be a breeze to clean! The hardest thing about Le Creuset is deciding which pretty color to buy!\"\n\nYou can check out the entire Le Creuset sale here and get free shipping with orders over $49.
