We got tons of responses, but it was pretty clear which apps were going to be our top recommendations within the first batch of comments. Without further ado, here are the best RSS readers/news aggregators, plus a few alternatives for good measure.\n\nThe Best: Feedly\n\nScreenshot: Brendan Hesse\n\nFeedly got the most comments and upvotes from readers, which isn\u2019t surprising \u2014 it\u2019s one of the few RSS readers with a modern design and active support behind it. It\u2019s also packed full of features. As I said in a previous post:\n\nIts chronological feed, flexible search and organisation tools, and cross-platform syncing are all excellent, and it helped me wean off Twitter for news \u2014 and just about everything else. Since it\u2019s an RSS reader, Feedly can even be used to track YouTube and podcast subscriptions, blogs, and even newsletters in some cases. Oh, and both the web and mobile versions have built-in dark themes.\n\nThose of you who voted for Feedly cited its ease of use, customisable interface, and helpful collection tools as noteworthy, and that\u2019s just for Feedly\u2019s free version. A Pro version is also available for about $9/month that adds even more customisation options, lets you follow an unlimited number of sources, and gives users more granular search and tracking options like alerts for specific keywords.\n\nThere\u2019s also a \u201cTeam\u201d version that gives users the ability to create \u201cboards\u201d the can be accessed and edited by multiple users, plus integration with apps like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and more. It\u2019s worth mentioning that the free version is ad-supported, but these are mostly unobtrusive and kept to a minimum. (Feedly Pro and Team are entirely ad-free.)\n\nEven with the ads, Feedly\u2019s free version is difficult to top. However, some readers commented that they found it to be cumbersome to use and others said they disliked the layout options. I\u2019ll admit I needed to change some of the feed display options before I was fully on-board, but once I had my preferences locked in I haven\u2019t looked back.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to click with Feedly, our runner-up pick is just as worthy of your consideration.\n\nScreenshot: Brendan Hesse\n\nInoreader came in a close second, and if you do a cursory internet search you\u2019ll find plenty of debates over whether Inoreader or Feedly is the superior product. In my opinion, both are excellent choices and you\u2019ll get a great RSS reader and news aggregation solution whichever service you pick.\n\nThe free, ad-supported versions of both services are largely identical, though Inoreader allows up to 150 sources compared to Feedly\u2019s 100. Inoreader has a fairly similar user interface to Feedly \u2014 their dark themes are practically identical \u2014 though Inoreader\u2019s layout is more compact and faster to navigate. Inoreader also has a built-in podcast player that will play audio in the background while you read through your feed.\n\nWhile the basic service is entirely free, Inoreader also has paid options. Users can nix ads and follow up to 500 sources for $30 a year (about $2 a month), but in order to get the best features \u2014 like an offline mode, unlimited news sources, feed automation, and robust search/tracking features \u2014 you\u2019ll need to pony up $75 a year. Interestingly, Inoreader also lets users pick advanced features a la carte.\n\nThe rest\n\nThe vast majority of Lifehacker commenters were either Feedly or Inoreader users, and they are hands-down the best choices for most people. That said, a few other other RSS readers are worth highlighting:\n\nFeedbro - FeedBro is an RSS reader extension available for Firefox, Chrome, and other Chromium-based browsers like Edge and Vivaldi. It has a clean (but basic) interface you can customise, and it comes with tons of social media integration. It\u2019s entirely free and, unlike some other RSS add-ons, is fully standalone \u2014 meaning you don\u2019t need to sync it with another RSS service for it to work.\n\nOpen-source options: Vienna RSS and Tiny Tiny RSS - A couple of open-source choices \u2014 Vienna RSS and Tiny Tiny RSS (or TTRSS) \u2014 were also mentioned by readers. I\u2019m a sucker for open-source applications, and both Vienna and TTRSS lets users create self-hosted RSS readers. These will require a bit more technical skill than simply signing up for one of the other apps or add-ons above, but they\u2019re great options for protecting your data and having full control over your news feed.", "description": "A few days ago, I asked you for your favourite news aggregator apps.
