Over these two days in autumn, the prime minister will have his last chance to sign off an agreement, before parliament requests his office to seek a Brexit negotiating extension.\n\nQueen\u2019s Speech: 14 October\n\nA Queen\u2019s Speech \u2013 setting out the government\u2019s legislative programme and domestic agenda for the coming year \u2013 is technically off the cards given the Supreme Court ruling last week that Mr Johnson\u2019s prorogation of five weeks was unlawful.\n\nBut No 10 has announced that the prime minister will take another shot at suspending parliament next week, in order to have a Queen\u2019s Speech on 14 October.\n\nHowever, this time the suspension of the Commons will be for several days, rather than several weeks, something the Supreme Court would find acceptable as it is in line with precedent.\n\nBrexit Extension Act: 19 October\n\nIf no deal has been agreed by this critical deadline then Mr Johnson will be forced by law to seek an extension to the negotiations. The Benn Act outlines a letter that should be sent from Downing Street to EU leaders, requesting a Brexit delay until January 2020.\n\nThe prime minister has consistently said he will obey the law, but has repeatedly refused to engage with direct questions about respecting the Benn Act, which of course he has branded the \u201csurrender act\u201d.\n\nIf he does ignore the act, expect a battle at the Supreme Court to immediately follow. Or, as the ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve has argued, for the Queen to dismiss the PM.\n\nHalloween Brexit deadline: 31 October\n\nThe extension secured by former prime minister Theresa May \u2013 one that sealed her fate \u2013 will be a critical date in Johnson\u2019s premiership. Since running for the leadership in the summer, the Tory leader\u2019s key message has to been to sever the UK\u2019s ties with bloc by the 31 October.\n\nIf he fails to secure a deal, the Benn Act ensures he cannot deliver on his 31 October promise \u2013 avoid a no-deal scenario on Halloween.\n\nBut if the PM defies expectations and reaches an agreement with Brussels that the House of Commons finds acceptable, it is possible Mr Johnson will agree to a \u201ctechnical extension\u201d, so there is time for key pieces of legislation, and for the European parliament to ratify the deal.\n\nWinter general election\n\nThere has not been a winter election since 1974, but most insiders in Westminster expect the British public to head to the polls in the coming months. If a Brexit extension is secured, avoiding a no-deal exit, Jeremy Corbyn has said he will back an election at this point.", "description": "Addressing Tory delegates\u00a0in his first speech as party leader, Boris Johnson laid out his \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d ultimatum to Brussels, kicking off a critical month in the Brexit process.\u00a0 \u201cThere is now very little time in which to negotiate a new agreement between the UK and the EU under Article 50,\u201d the PM later wrote in his letter to Brussels. \u201cWe need to get this\u00a0done", "authors": ["Ashley Cowburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/11/boris-speech-3.jpg"}
