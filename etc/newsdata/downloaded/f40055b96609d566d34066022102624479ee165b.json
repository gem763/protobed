Last year, Mr. Silver told CNN that the \u201csense of an obligation, social responsibility, a desire to speak up directly about issues that are important\u201d is \u201cpart of being an NBA player.\u201d Taking note of a certain meekness in other corporate suites, he said, \u201cI think in this day and age, you really do have to stand for something.\u201d\n\nIt was entirely consistent with this ideal that the general manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, posted an image on Twitter on Friday night that included support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protests: \u201cFight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d Though Mr. Morey soon deleted it, the tweet quickly angered China\u2019s Communist rulers. They have been struggling to squelch the Hong Kong protestors, who want China to honor its commitments for democracy and rule of law in that semi-autonomous territory. The Chinese Consulate in Houston declared it was \u201cdeeply shocked by the erroneous comments\u201d and demanded the team \u201ccorrect the error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact.\u201d\n\nPathetically, the league immediately capitulated, essentially importing to the United States China\u2019s denial of free speech. It apologized to China, saying Mr. Morey\u2019s tweet was \u201cregrettable\u201d; a Chinese-language version called it \u201cinappropriate.\u201d The team owner rushed to disavow Mr. Morey\u2019s support for democracy, tweeting that Mr. Morey \u201cdoes NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets.\u201d Mr. Morey issued a groveling reconsideration that would have been welcome in a Communist Party criticism/self-criticism session.\n\nOf course, a lot of money is at stake. The Chinese Basketball Association immediately suspended relations with the Houston Rockets. Sponsors began pulling back from deals. Tencent, the Chinese digital rights holder for NBA broadcasts, dropped the team from streaming. The NBA is big business in China, where 500 million people watched games last season, according to the Associated Press, and where a new streaming deal alone will generate $1.5 billion for the league over the next five years.\n\nBut that\u2019s the point. China is attempting to enforce its version of the truth all around the world \u2014 bullying Chinese-language newspapers in Canada and the United States, patrolling the speech of its students abroad, demanding that foreign airlines and hotel chains wipe Taiwan off their maps. Some of its targets don\u2019t have the wherewithal to stand up to this assault \u2014 which is why the NBA\u2019s cravenness is so damaging. With all its financial muscle, its enormous popularity and its moral preening, if the NBA can cave so easily, who will resist the censorship of the Communist dictators?\n\nThose dictators will say, as usual, that Mr. Morey\u2019s tweet offended the \u201cChinese people.\u201d But because the Chinese people themselves are not free to speak out \u2014 since anyone in China expressing support for the Hong Kong movement is also punished \u2014 those claims should not be taken seriously. And if Mr. Silver really believes that \u201cyou really do have to stand for something\u201d \u2014 what will it be, if not freedom of expression in Hong Kong, in Houston and around the world?", "description": "In a reprehensible collapse, the league apologizes.", "authors": ["Editorial Board", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RJFGIzOrI0dO7UrVgtQ1bSwUMjs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O2ULNIXJHII6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
