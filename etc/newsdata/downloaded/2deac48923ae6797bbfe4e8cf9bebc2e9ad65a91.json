Some of the heavyweights scheduled to report this week include Procter & Gamble, UPS, McDonald\u2019s, Chipotle, Snap, Caterpillar, Boeing, Ford, Microsoft, PayPal, Tesla, Twitter, Amazon, Intel and American Airlines.\n\nThrough Friday, about 18% of the S&P\u2019s market cap reported earnings. \u201cEarnings are beating by 4.9%, with 78% of companies exceeding their bottom-line estimates. This compares to 5.4% and 71% over the past 3 years,\u201d Credit Suisse strategist Jonathan Golub pointed out in a note Friday.\n\nWhile earnings season has been off to a positive start with big banks delivering solid results, some strategists warn that it is too early to brush off concerns of negative earnings growth. \u201cAs any seasoned runner knows, an aggressive pace out of the gate may be difficult to maintain,\u201d Raymond James Chief Investment Officer Larry Adam wrote in weekly note to clients Friday. \u201cAs we cautioned last week, headline earnings were expected to decline 4% year-over-year (YoY) in 3Q19, and although earnings typically beat estimates by ~4%, it is likely to \u2018come down to the wire\u2019 on whether or not we can skirt negative earnings growth. The next two weeks should provide additional insights, as 284 companies representing ~66% of the market capitalization of the S&P 500 are set to report.\u201d\n\nAdam explained that the tech sector will be a key group to watch this earnings season and reiterated the firms positive outlook on the sector. \u201cThere are growing concerns that the slowdown in global economic momentum and the US-China trade war could start to impact the [tech] sector\u2019s earnings,\u201d Adam noted. \u201cEarnings expectations were revised lower by 1.46% in the preceding three months, but that is substantially less than the 3.87% downward revision for the broader market. Over the last ten quarters, the Technology sector has seen the second largest earnings beats at 6.8% and we expect similar success this quarter. Headline risk (e.g., anti-trust debate) could present an opportunity to add exposure, and we maintain our positive outlook on the sector as it has historically been the top performer in an \u2018insurance\u2019 rate cut environment.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the economic calendar for this week is rather light, and the Federal Reserve will be entering its quiet period ahead of its scheduled policy meeting at the end of this month.\n\nNew home sales and durable goods orders will be in focus for investors on Thursday.\n\nA construction site of new homes is seen at Leyden Rock in Arvada, Colorado. REUTERS/Rick Wilking More\n\nEconomists are expecting solid data for September\u2019s new home sales. \u201cNew single family home sales likely came in at a solid 700k [seasonally adjusted annual rate] in September, down slightly from the 713k [seasonally adjusted annual rate] print in August,\u201d Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note Friday. \u201cWe take signal from the a couple of indicators: (1) Single family housing starts were little changed in August and (2) the NAHB's present single family sales index rose two points in September. These both point to a solid September print for new home sales.\u201d\n\nDurable goods orders in September are likely to have been negatively impacted by the General Motors strike, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cThe preliminary September durable goods orders report should show a 1.3% decline in headline orders,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cMuch of this decline is likely due to the GM-UAW auto strikes, which contributed to a 0.7% mom drop in manufacturing production in September.\u201d Core capital goods orders are expected to remain unchanged in September.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow (^DJI) are just 1% from all-time highs, while the Nasdaq (^IXIC) is sitting about 2% from record highs.\n\nEarnings calendar\n\nMonday: Halliburton (HAL) before market open; TD Ameritrade (AMTD), Del Taco (TACO) after market close", "description": "Earnings will be the focal point for investors this week, as about a quarter of the S&P 500 companies gear up to report results.", "authors": ["Heidi Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/y9A.VYaUwunxIqjz.EJe2A--~B/aD0zNjAwO3c9NTQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/cfcc15f0-f351-11e9-badf-4d3b4fa4a3de", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
