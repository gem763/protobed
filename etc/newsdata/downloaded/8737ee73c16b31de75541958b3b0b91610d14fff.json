But the new reporting gets closer to confirming it.\n\nAD\n\nThe key revelation is that Mulvaney was the official who carried out Trump\u2019s directive to freeze the funds. This came a week before Trump\u2019s July 25 call, in which he pressured Zelensky to carry out \u201cinvestigations\u201d designed to undercut the fact of Russian sabotage of the 2016 election, and to manufacture smears of potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden.\n\nAD\n\nAs the Times puts it, Trump \u201cdirected\u201d Mulvaney \u201cdays ahead of the call to place a hold on the aid.\u201d\n\nBut did Mulvaney know why Trump had done this? The Times answers that question as follows:\n\nMr. Mulvaney has told associates that the administration paused the aid to try to push Ukraine to more robustly fight corruption, not in connection with pressuring Ukraine to uncover dirt on of Mr. Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nThis is supposed to be exonerating, but it\u2019s an important concession. If true, Mulvaney has privately acknowledged a direct link between the freeze of the military aid and Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to fight \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney is still maintaining that he didn\u2019t understand Trump\u2019s demand to investigate \u201ccorruption\u201d as a demand to carry out the political scheme Trump had hatched.\n\nBut there is already extensive evidence out there on the public record that renders this highly implausible.\n\nThe public statements\n\nFirst, there are the multiple public statements from Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani \u2014 and Trump himself.\n\nAD\n\nIn early May, Giuliani laid out the whole plot in an interview with the Times. Giuliani confirmed he planned to urge Zelensky to pursue investigations designed to fortify a conspiracy theory undercutting the fact of Russian interference, and to push a false narrative involving the role of Biden\u2019s son on the board of Ukrainian company Burisma.\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani claimed these things would be \u201cvery helpful to my client,\u201d i.e., Trump. And at the time, Giuliani repeatedly tweeted demands that Ukraine investigate Biden. Trump himself railed on Fox in May about the invented narrative of Biden corruption in Ukraine.\n\nAll that occurred before Mulvaney carried out Trump\u2019s directive to freeze the aid. It deeply strains credulity that Mulvaney would not have known about these things, or would not have understood their relevance to Trump\u2019s subsequent demands for an investigation of Ukraine \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe texts\n\nSecond, there are the texts released by Democrats. They show that just before the July 25 call, Ambassador Kurt Volker told an aide to Zelensky that the White House had indicated Zelensky could get a White House meeting \u2014 if he did an investigation that would uncover the supposed truth about 2016.\n\nAD\n\nThat confirms that just after the military aid was frozen, the White House and Volker were communicating that Trump\u2019s demand for investigations of \u201ccorruption\u201d was actually a demand to fortify Trumpworld\u2019s favorite conspiracy theory about 2016 \u2014 a key Trump political demand.\n\nAnd in multiple subsequent texts, Volker and Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who was operating at Trump\u2019s direction, worked to get what Sondland called the \u201cdeliverable,\u201d a statement from Ukraine pledging to investigate Burisma, the fabricated tale about Biden. Sondland is expected to testify Thursday that for months before the call, he was working to secure that commitment from Ukraine \u2014 to investigate Biden.\n\nAD\n\nIn these particular cases, the quid pro quo discussed was for the meeting. But what all this also confirms is that, by \u201cinvestigate corruption,\u201d Trump really meant, \u201cinvestigate Biden.\u201d Indeed, Ambassador William Taylor twice objected to what was happening on precisely those grounds.\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney almost certainly knew of all of this.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s role in meetings\n\nUnderscoring that further, The Post reports that Mulvaney was directly involved in numerous discussions with Sondland about the evolving plot, and sat in on meetings between Trump and Giuliani at precisely the time Giuliani was explicitly pushing for the Ukrainian investigation of Biden.\n\nIn this larger context, Mulvaney\u2019s private admission that the freeze in military aid was tied directly to Trump\u2019s demand for an investigation of \u201ccorruption\u201d becomes a lot more important. Because Mulvaney surely knew what \u201cinvestigate corruption\u201d really meant, it strongly suggests Mulvaney knew that for Trump, the military aid \u2014 which Mulvaney himself froze \u2014 also turned on whether Zelensky carried out those investigations Trump wanted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor this not to be true, Mulvaney would have had to be unaware of numerous public statements from Giuliani and Trump. He would have had to be clueless about what Sondland, Volker, Giuliani \u2014 and, of course, Trump \u2014 really wanted after being involved in multiple discussions with them that directly concerned how to make Trump happy with what Ukraine was doing for him.\n\nThat seems unlikely at best. And it suggests we\u2019ll be learning more soon enough \u2014 perhaps confirming that Sanders got the bigger story exactly right.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Bernie Sanders made an explosive charge about Trump.
