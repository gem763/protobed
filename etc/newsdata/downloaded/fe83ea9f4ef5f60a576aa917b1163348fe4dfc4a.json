This property was valued at US$3.2-3.5 million as at June 7, with US$2.3 million owed to the bank.\n\nMr Harvey is a US businessman who founded and manages two firms in the engineering and fabrication business in Ponca City, Oklahoma.\n\nOperating in Ponca City, the JV would have provided mechanical engineering, electrical and instrumental services, as well as specialised services to the oil and energy industries in the US.\n\nOn Monday, Mun Siong said that its executive director, financial director and solicitors in the US had been in discussions with the financial institution and Mr Harvey, but those talks were not conclusive.\n\nMun Siong said it is thus in its interest to withdraw from the JV, seeing as the loan agreements are between the financial institution and Mr Harvey\u2019s companies (with him acting as guarantor), and that such negotiations will likely be protracted.\n\nMun Siong will continue to seek business opportunities in the North America market.\n\nLast month, the group also incorporated Pegasus Advance Engineering (Netherlands) BV, a holding company for its interest in North America. The Netherlands holding company will be a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Mun Siong, and also owns 100 per cent of PAE US.\n\nShares of Mun Siong on the Singapore bourse\u2019s main board was flat at 4.2 Singapore cents as at 2.05pm on Monday.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - WATCH-LISTED Mun Siong Engineering has withdrawn from its proposed 75 per cent joint venture (JV) in the US with a businessman, it announced on Monday. .
