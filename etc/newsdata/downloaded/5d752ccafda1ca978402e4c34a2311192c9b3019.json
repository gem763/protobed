The prime minister, Boris Johnson, wrote to the retired high court judge this month saying he must publish the report no later than 30 October.\n\nThe inquiry said in a statement on Friday that core participants including the bereaved, survivors and families will receive the report 36 hours earlier \u201cunder strict embargo\u201d.\n\nHow Grenfell survivors came together - and how Britain failed them Read more\n\nThe original plan had been to publish this spring but it was delayed when the team realised it was a \u201cfar more complex and time-consuming task than originally anticipated\u201d. That led families to complain: \u201cA slow justice is a painful justice.\u201d\n\nThe focus of the inquiry so far has been on the events of 14 June 2017, encompassing the London fire brigade\u2019s response, the decision to order residents to stay put while fire engulfed the building and communication between residents and 999 emergency call operators.\n\nThe inquiry report is expected to draw conclusions about the leadership of the LFB, including its commissioner, Dany Cotton, who has already announced her retirement, and its preparedness for a cladding fire. Cotton angered survivors when she said planning for such an event was akin to planning for a \u201cspace shuttle landing on the Shard\u201d.\n\nIt also investigated in detail how the fire started in a fourth-floor flat and spread to the top of the building in less than 30 minutes through the largely combustible cladding system installed in 2016. Some of the bereaved and survivors who are core participants in the inquiry hope that Moore-Bick will reach a determination about whether or not the building met building regulations, something that has remained unclear since the disaster.\n\nThe second phase of the inquiry is due to start in January and will examine the lead-up to the night of the fire, including the decisions made by the owner of the 24 storey tower, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and the landlord, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenants Management Organisation, the architects Studio E, the contractor Rydon and the material suppliers including Celotex and Arconic.\n\nIt has already taken 200,000 documents and the conclusions are not expected until at least 2021, which means that any decisions on charges of manslaughter or corporate manslaughter by the Crown Prosecution Service are not likely to take place until after that.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Conclusions of public inquiry into fire that claimed 72 lives published on 30 October", "authors": ["Robert Booth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1282432e2a41b1e56856d8228ab2b951805deb9/0_62_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eae886b73413a29567a0cf0ca3f84069", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
