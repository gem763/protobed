Dean, 44, and Natalee Dean, 37, in a statement detailing the accident.\n\nJacob, an oil company worker, was contacted by Aghorn Energy to check on a pump house located in a rural area of Odessa.\n\nJacob Dean (pictured) and his wife Natalee Dean (pictured) died after consuming hydrogen sulfide at a pump house in Odessa, Texas\n\nJacob reportedly arrived to the scene, but was gone long enough for Natalee to become concerned about his whereabouts.\n\nKnowing where the pump house was, Natalee loaded the couples six-year-old and nine-year-old children into the family's car to go check on Jacob.\n\nUnbeknownst to his family and Aghorn Energy, the pump house was full of H2S gas and Jacob died after being consumed by the deadly fumes.\n\nAghorn Energy dispatched Jacob to the pump house location (pictured), but called authorities when they did not receive a status update from him\n\nHydrogen Sulfide H2S is a gas usually found during the production of crude oils and natural gas, according to OSHA. H2S can be extremely dangerous and kill people almost instantly. It is not recommended to rely on a sense of smell to identify H2S because it can cause people to lose the ability to smell the gas even though it is present.\n\nUpon arrival, Natalee left the children inside the car and walked to the pump house to look for Jacob.\n\nNatalee inhaled the gas and died as well.\n\nAn Aghorn Energy supervisor called law enforcement to have officers check the pump house location after not receiving a status update from Jacob.\n\nEmergency services and sheriff\u2019s officers determined the presence of H2S.\n\nSince the children stayed inside the car and were at a distance from the pump house, they only contracted a slight exposure to the gas.\n\nThe couple's children (left and right) contracted a slight exposure to the gas and were taken to a local hospital for treatment\n\nAuthorities removed the children from the scene, decontaminated them and took them to Medical Center Hospital for treatment.\n\nThey are currently in the custody of their grandparents\n\nThe investigation is still ongoing.\n\nAghorn Energy could not be reached for comments.", "description": "Jacob Dean, an oil company worker, died of gas poisoning at a pump house in Odessa, Texas, and his wife Natalee Dean was killed by the same fumes when she checked on him", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/12/20325194-0-image-a-7_1572353460855.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
