REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nMELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia will invest A$150 million ($101 million) in its companies and technology to help U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s bid for a moon landing by 2024 and subsequent U.S. missions to Mars, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said over the weekend.\n\nMorrison, visiting NASA headquarters in Washington, said the five-year investment plan would help businesses support U.S. automation systems, build equipment for space craft and play a role in mineral exploration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re backing Australian businesses to the moon, and even Mars, and back,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nThe announcement came after Morrison made a state visit to the White House on Friday, with the red carpet rolled out, signaling Australia\u2019s strong ties with the United States after a period of tense relations with China.\n\nThe investment is part of a broader Australian plan to beef up its space sector, with Morrison saying the government wants to triple the size of the sector to A$12 billion and create some 20,000 extra jobs by 2030.\n\nTrump, when asked at a joint news conference with Morrison about the U.S. space program, said the focus was on Mars.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stopping at the moon,\u201d he said, according to a transcript.\n\n\u201cThe moon is actually a launching pad. That\u2019s why we\u2019re stopping at the moon. I said, \u2018hey, we\u2019ve already done the moon. That\u2019s not so exciting\u2019. They said, \u2018no, sir, it\u2019s a launching pad for Mars\u2019. So we\u2019ll be doing the moon but we\u2019ll really be doing Mars.\u201d", "description": "Australia will invest A$150 million ($101 million) in its companies and technology to help U.S. President Donald Trump's bid for a moon landing by 2024 and subsequent U.S. missions to Mars, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said over the weekend.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432492182&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L017", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
