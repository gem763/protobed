I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning.\u201d\n\nBolton has continually supported and defended the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Critics have long panned his aggressive foreign policy approach and eagerness for war, both of which frequently clashed with Trump\u2019s own approach to military intervention.\n\n\u201cI thank John very much for his service,\u201d Trump said, noting that he plans to name Bolton\u2019s replacement next week. Charlie Kupperman, who was deputy national security adviser under Bolton, will fill in as the acting adviser.\n\nIn a tweet of his own, Bolton said he had offered to resign Monday evening but Trump responded, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham took issue with Bolton\u2019s apparent suggestion that he left voluntarily, claiming in a text to The Daily Beast that Trump had in fact demanded Bolton\u2019s resignation.\n\nThe national security adviser was expected to appear at a White House security briefing early Tuesday afternoon alongside Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nBolton, who served in the Trump administration for more than a year, has worked for every Republican president since Ronald Reagan. He was Trump\u2019s third national security adviser since his January 2017 inauguration, following Michael Flynn and H.R. McMaster. (Former President Barack Obama had three national security advisers over his two terms; President George W. Bush had two.)\n\nSome of the president\u2019s allies commended the decision to fire Bolton; Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said it was a \u201cnecessary action.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Democratic former Gov. Jerry Brown took a different tone: \u201cGood riddance,\u201d he said of the national security adviser.\n\nI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2019\n\n....I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2019\n\nBolton\u2019s departure follows reports of growing tensions between the national security adviser and the president earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI disagree very much with John Bolton. His attitude in the Middle East and Iraq \u2014 was going into Iraq,\u201d the president told reporters in June. \u201cI think that was a big mistake and I\u2019ve been proven right.\u201d\n\nAfter Iran shot down a U.S. drone in June, Trump called off a retaliatory military strike, calling it a disproportionate response. Bolton has long advocated for military action in Iran but did not publicly oppose Trump\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cI have two groups of people: I have doves and I have hawks,\u201d Trump said when asked on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d if his advisers were pressuring him into taking military action. \u201cJohn Bolton is absolutely a hawk. If it was up to him, he\u2019d take on the whole world at one time.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Bolton was reported to have torpedoed a potential summit between the Trump administration and Taliban leaders for which Pompeo had advocated, according to The New York Times. The leaders would have discussed a pathway to peace as U.S. military intervention in Afghanistan reaches its 18th year, pursuant to Trump\u2019s promise to roll back U.S. troop levels in the region.\n\nBolton\u2019s position on the potential peace plan frustrated Trump, The Washington Post reported.\n\nPrior to joining the White House, Bolton advocated for a preemptive strike on North Korea, though the president has often touted his diplomatic relationship with the country as one of the major successes of his presidency. When Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June, Bolton was notably absent.\n\nYet he did align with Trump on birtherism, the racist movement spearheaded by Trump, having once joked that Obama was a Muslim.\n\nThis story has been updated throughout.", "description": "The national security adviser's hawkish stance has been frequently at odds with the president's own approach to military intervention.", "authors": ["Breaking News Intern", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d1a35ee250000a81ae9c07c.jpeg?cache=ikrjazc1as&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
