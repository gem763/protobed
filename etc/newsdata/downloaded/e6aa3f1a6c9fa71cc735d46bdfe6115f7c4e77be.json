The report sent the S&P 500 surging above its record closing high, as the three major indices added to earlier gains after a batch of corporate earnings results.\n\nAt its highest point Friday, the S&P 500 rose to as much as 3,027.39, surpassing the closing high of 3,025.86 it reached in late July. It came within one point of its all-time intraday high of 3,027.98.\n\nHere\u2019s where the markets settled Friday:\n\nS&P 500 (^GSPC): +0.41%, or 12.26 points\n\nDow (^DJI): +0.57%, or 151.58 points\n\nNasdaq (^IXIC): +0.7%, or 57.32 points\n\n10-year Treasury yield (^TNX): +3.2 bps to 1.798%\n\nWTI crude oil prices (CL=F): +0.7% to $56.66 per barrel\n\nGold (GC=F): +0.19% to $1,507.60 per ounce\n\nIn a statement, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke Friday with China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He to discuss a phase one deal between both countries.\n\n\u201cThey made headway on specific issues and the two sides are close to finalizing some sections of the agreement,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDiscussions will go on continuously at the deputy level, and the principals will have another call in the near future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, investors weighed a mix bag of corporate earnings to the upside, shrugging off earlier declines after mega-cap Amazon (AMZN) reported a disappointing quarter. The Dow rose more than 100 points as shares of component company Intel (INTC) surged more than 8% after the chipmaker topped third-quarter expectations and guidance.\n\nThe busiest week for earnings season has provided investors with a mixed picture of the state of corporations. Against a backdrop of slowing global growth and ongoing trade concerns, the current slate of quarterly reports have managed \u2013 or in some cases failed \u2013 to navigate the choppy macroeconomic picture.\n\nEarnings misses from major bellwethers including Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM) for manufacturers, and Texas Instruments (TXN) for semiconductors, reinforced the woes felt by sectors most exposed to the current environment. But the weaker-than-expected reports this week were balanced out with strong results from other closely watched names like Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Blackstone (BX).\n\nAmid the deluge of reports, the three major domestic stock indices each posted weekly advances. The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, the Dow rose 0.7% and the Nasdaq climbed 1.9% for the week.\n\nEARNINGS: Amazon\u2019s shipping costs strike again\n\nAmazon (AMZN) missed third-quarter earnings expectations and gave a disappointing fourth-quarter forecast as higher shipping costs associated with one-day deliveries crimped margins during yet another quarter. Profit dropped on a year-over-year basis for the first time in more than two years during the period, coming out to $4.23 per share, versus the $4.59 expected, according to Bloomberg-compiled consensus data.\n\nOperating margins shrank over last quarter to 4.5%, from 2.9% in the second quarter and 7.4% in the first, and sales growth in its higher-margin Amazon Web Services business sank below 40% for a second consecutive quarter.\n\nTraders and financial professionals work on the floor on the New York Stock Exchange.

During each of the two quarters prior, it exceeded that amount. It also expects holiday-quarter revenue will be as much as $86.5 billion, short of the $87 billion consensus analysts were anticipating.\n\nVisa (V), on the other hand, topped expectations on the top and bottom lines for the third quarter. However, the stock fluctuated between gains and losses during overnight trading as investors considered the miss on cross-border volumes, an area where Visa is able to capture higher fees than domestic transactions. The company has also been shelling out more on incentives to lure bank and retail partners to its network.", "description": "U.S. stocks pushed higher after the Trump administration said it was making progress on a preliminary trade agreement with China.
