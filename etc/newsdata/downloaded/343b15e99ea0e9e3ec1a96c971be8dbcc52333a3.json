The league halted use of the word \u201cowner,\u201d calling it racially insensitive, and big-name coaches such as Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors and Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs have routinely blasted President Trump.\n\nBut since China\u2019s crackdown on the NBA after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey posted a tweet supporting democracy in Hong Kong, the league has been less than outspoken. Rockets star James Harden tweeted an apology \u2014 to China. Mr. Kerr told reporters he didn\u2019t have an opinion on the matter and declined to comment.\n\nMr. Trump weighed in Wednesday, accusing Mr. Kerr and Mr. Popovich of \u201cpandering to China\u201d while declining to offer advice to the league. \u201cThe NBA knows what they are doing,\u201d he said.\n\nJason Whitlock, right-tilting host of \u201cSpeak for Yourself\u201d on Fox Sports, said, \u201cThe NBA is strangling on its own hypocrisy.\n\n\u201cThey branded themselves as the social justice league \u2026 [but] you\u2019re not social justice activists; you\u2019re business people. Because when China tells you to shut the hell up, everybody shuts the hell up,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the NBA has drawn the spotlight this week, the league\u2019s troubles in China are hardly unique. They mirror the difficulties faced by other Western corporations seeking to cash in on China\u2019s billion-dollar retail market, second only to the U.S. market, as they learn that doing business with the easily offended Communist Party of China often means parking your convictions at the door.\n\n\u201cThis is pervasive across our economy, and the companies usually don\u2019t speak out,\u201d said Hudson Institute senior fellow Robert Spalding. \u201cIt\u2019s usually not public. But obviously, the NBA\u2019s a very public organization and really can\u2019t escape it.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s penchant for censorship has heightened amid global support for the thousands of protesters taking to the streets of Hong Kong, often leaving companies doing business in China with a choice between growing their bottom line and standing up for freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, they\u2019re in conflict,\u201d said Mr. Spalding. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem for the leadership of these companies: They have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profit, and the Chinese are basically destroying that. It really forces the companies to betray the principles and values of a free and democratic society.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the hotel chain Marriott International, which fired its social media manager last year after he \u201cliked\u201d a post listing Tibet as a separate country and the Shanghai Municipal Tourism Administration called for the company to apologize and \u201cseriously deal with the people responsible,\u201d as reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThis week, California-based Activision Blizzard stripped gamer Chung Ng Wai of his title and professional winnings in the Asia-Pacific Grandmaster tournament after he appeared at a post-victory press conference in a gas mask like those worn by protesters and shouted, \u201cLiberate Hong Kong!\u201d\n\nPosh jeweler Tiffany & Co. deleted an image of a Chinese model covering her eye \u2014 a symbol of the Hong Kong uprising since a protester was hit with a police beanbag in her right eye \u2014 even though the company said the photo was taken in May and was \u201cin no way intended to be a political statement.\u201d\n\nTech giant Apple, which provided a crowdsourcing app that lets Hong Kong protesters track police movements, came under vigorous fire this week in the People\u2019s Daily, an official paper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which called the American firm an \u201cescort\u201d for \u201crioters\u201d and said Chinese should boycott the company\u2019s products.\n\nMr. Silver, who was in Shanghai on a previously planned visit during the breach, was credited for taking a stronger free speech stance Tuesday after the league came under fire for its initial statement saying Mr. Morey\u2019s comments \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do know there are consequences from freedom of speech; we will have to live with those consequences,\u201d Mr. Silver said at a Tuesday press conference.\n\nMr. Popovich waded into the fray Wednesday, praising Mr. Silver for his \u201ccourage\u201d and calling him \u201ca very progressive leader\u201d without directly mentioning China.\n\nThat left an opening for Mr. Trump, who said Mr. Kerr was \u201cshaking\u201d and \u201ccouldn\u2019t answer the question\u201d and accused the coaches of kowtowing to China.\n\n\u201cI watch the way that Kerr and Popovich and some of the others were pandering to China, and yet to our own country, it\u2019s like they don\u2019t respect it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they don\u2019t respect it. I said, \u2018What a difference \u2014 isn\u2019t it sad?\u2019 It\u2019s very sad. To me, it\u2019s very sad.\u201d\n\nThe tension has spilled into the NBA preseason. Demonstrators from a human rights group called the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation protested at a Washington Wizards preseason game Wednesday night in the U.S. against the Guangzhou Loong Lions from China.\n\nBut the league and/or its teams seem to be siding with China in the U.S. too.\n\nWhen the Chinese team played Tuesday in Philadelphia, two 76ers fans were kicked out of the game for causing a disruption that the fans told reporters consisted of support for the Hong Kong protests. At the Wizards game, fans wearing \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d T-shirts had a large protest sign confiscated.\n\nTravis Weber, vice president for policy and government affairs at the conservative Family Research Council, said the NBA\u2019s response revealed a double standard.\n\n\u201cWe see corporate activism on issues where it\u2019s palatable in elite circles to act along socially liberal lines, yet on other issues where they can\u2019t so easily stand up, they seem them exposing their double standard,\u201d Mr. Weber said.\n\nWhile the NBA is trying to grow its brand in China, where the league is increasingly popular in a country with an estimated 300 million recreational basketball players, that\u2019s not the problem, the league\u2019s critics say.\n\n\u201cI understand businesses are in business to make money,\u201d Mr. Weber said. \u201cThe problem is not with them saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to pursue growth and profit.\u2019 The problem is when they portray themselves as socially enlightened actors and then don\u2019t act consistently with their principles.\u201d\n\nMr. Spalding praised the Trump administration\u2019s get-tough policies with China, including tariffs on its goods and withholding visas for party and business leaders. He said such actions are badly overdue after decades of policies aimed at enabling \u201cthe rise of China under the failed belief that they would democratize.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd of course, they took advantage of that because they had no interest in democratizing,\u201d Mr. Spalding said. \u201cAnd so instead, what they did was to create this very predatory environment that we\u2019re finally starting to wake up to.\u201d\n\n\u2981 James Varney and Adam Zielonka contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
