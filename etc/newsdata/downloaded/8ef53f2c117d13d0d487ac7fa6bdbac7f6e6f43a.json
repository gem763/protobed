He was later declared dead in hospital.\n\nKeith Stephens, from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, told local media that the hunter's death was \"one of the stranger things that's happened\" in his 20 years of working for the agency.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how long he left [the buck] there, but he went up to check it to make sure it was dead. And evidently it wasn\u2019t,\" Mr Stephens told local network KY3.\n\n\u201cWhen you get up there, be really careful around it because it may not be dead. But if you let them lay there for a while and they don\u2019t move, and he may have done that. We just don\u2019t know,\" he added.\n\nMr Stephens said that it was unclear whether Mr Alexander had died from the puncture wounds, or another cause, such as a heart attack.\n\nHe added that he believes there will not be an autopsy on Mr Alexander's body, so the actual cause of death may never be known.\n\nMr Stephens said he has only come across a similar incident one other time in the state, when someone was struck by a buck's antlers.\n\nHe said the injury was \"pretty significant\", but added that the person survived.\n\nThe Arkansas Game and Fish Commission said it advises that hunters wait around 30 minutes to check a deer is not moving before approaching it.\n\nThe wildlife agency said it has been searching for the wounded animal.", "description": "A hunter in the US was gored to death after a deer he believed he had shot dead got up and attacked him.", "authors": ["Rozina Sabur"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mqnPvhWTjIYzZ1SetdOTNg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/6b9a6b76ad11b1f7973b7e83c1604fa1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
