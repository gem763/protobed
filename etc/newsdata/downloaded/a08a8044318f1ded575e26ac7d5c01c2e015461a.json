For a moment the play looked open, but by the time Case Keenum\u2019s pass reached McLaurin, Dallas\u2019s Byron Jones had arrived. The ball was knocked away.\n\nMaybe if the throw had been a little more to the right . . .\n\nMaybe if McLaurin was another step ahead of Jones . . .\n\nMaybe the day would have turned out differently.\n\n\u201cThat would have been nice,\u201d Gruden said with a sad shake of his head after the Redskins\u2019 31-21 loss to the Cowboys at FedEx Field.\n\nInstead, it was the first miss in a day of misses in what is becoming a season of misses. Missed throws. Missed star players. Missed tackles. The Redskins insist they have the talent to be good, that they are just around the corner from the victory that will inspire the turnaround that will keep this season from careening into disaster.\n\nBut two games in, Washington is now 0-2, trampled by division rivals Philadelphia and Dallas, who have plowed through its defense in the middle and end of games with terrifying efficiency. \u201cDrove it down our throats,\u201d was the phrase Gruden used to describe the way Dallas ran for 213 yards and put up 474 yards of total offense Sunday.\n\n[The key moments from Redskins\u2019 31-21 loss to the Cowboys in home opener]\n\nThe coaches and players don\u2019t think they are getting things wrong. They still believe the defense is very good when completely healthy. They are sure the game plan is solid based on the openings players such as McLaurin are getting. They are certain they can go against potential playoff teams such as the Eagles and Cowboys and stop key players such as DeSean Jackson and Ezekiel Elliott, who have torn them apart in the first two weeks. If not for the misses . . .\n\nThey talk a lot about what they miss on offense without star tight end Jordan Reed, still out with a concussion, and running back Derrius Guice, who will miss at least half the season with a torn meniscus. They talk about what they have lost in defensive lineman Jonathan Allen, out since early in the first game with a knee injury, and Allen\u2019s backup, Caleb Brantley, who is on injured reserve. They say they miss cornerbacks Quinton Dunbar and Fabian Moreau, out on Sunday as well. And they expressed frustration at the circumstance that has left them signing players such as cornerback Aaron Colvin, who was added late Friday afternoon.\n\nGruden has been anxious to get Reed back on the field, and he said after last week\u2019s game that the losses of Allen and Brantley caused the rest of the defensive players to wear down, allowing the Eagles to run over them in the second half of the season opener.\n\n\u201cThis week was a little bit harder,\u201d Gruden said Sunday. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about your fourth defensive back [who] we just signed [Friday]. . . . We\u2019re a little shorthanded back there. Once we get our guys back I\u2019ll feel a little better about our secondary.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, \u201cWe can\u2019t give up 200 yards rushing to anybody. Anytime. Anyplace. Anywhere. So that\u2019s something we\u2019ve got to hone in on.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to focus on, however. Just like the first game, the Redskins played well early, putting together a powerful drive at the end of the first quarter that led to an Adrian Peterson touchdown at the start of the second. And then their defense was flattened. Dallas scored on five straight possessions, during which they rolled for a demoralizing 377 yards, four touchdowns and a field goal that turned a 7-0 Redskins lead into a 31-14 Cowboys advantage late in the fourth quarter. A McLaurin touchdown catch with 2:17 left made the game look much closer than it was.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of overcoming adversity,\u201d defensive tackle Tim Settle, Allen\u2019s replacement, said after the game. \u201cWhen your name is called you got to be able to step up. That\u2019s a part of being in this league. You got to be able to play. You got to be able to step up. You got to be able to make something happen when you step on the field.\u201d\n\nIn the end, there were too many misses. Not only did Keenum miss hitting McLaurin at the start of the game, he missed seeing a wide open Paul Richardson Jr., who had nothing but green turf between him and the end zone early in the fourth quarter. A touchdown would have brought the Redskins to within three points. Instead, Keenum forced a pass to Trey Quinn that was almost intercepted and threw wide of running back Chris Thompson on fourth and three on the next play.\n\n\u201cI totally missed Paul,\u201d Keenum later lamented after also blaming himself for another long throw to an open McLaurin that sailed out of McLaurin\u2019s reach.\n\nComplete those passes, and maybe it would have been a different game. Ultimately, they turned out to be more blown chances on an afternoon full of them.\n\nThe Redskins tried to stay positive afterward. They said the same things about how the season is not over, and how this is a young team that is regularly using seven rookies, started its No. 3 tight end and is still trying to survive offensively during left tackle Trent Williams\u2019s holdout.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find the [way] to overcome this and make things happen,\u201d safety Landon Collins said.\n\nStill, the season is in danger of slipping away after two ugly losses within the division. If something is going to change, it will have to be fast.", "description": "Little issues add up to big disappointment as Washington falls to 0-2 with a 31-21 home loss against Dallas.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins", "September At Pm", "Les Carpenter Returned To The Washington Post In", "Writes About The Washington Redskins."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6clV4fGXtW1RIQKqTCwy_lRQCoo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4R2UF5GX7MI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
