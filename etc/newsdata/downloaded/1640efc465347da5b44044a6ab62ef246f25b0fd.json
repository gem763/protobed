Then, of course I would ask the UK, to send a commissioner,\" explained von der Leyen.\n\nOn Monday, she will informally meet with the new French candidate, that Paris announced this week.\n\nThierry Breton would be in charge of the Internal Market... But some MEPs are already seeing potential conflicts of interest.\n\nSergey Lagodinsky, German Green MEP, member of committee that investigates conflict of interest of candidates said:\n\n\"Mr Breton is as far as I understand is an honorary civil servant of for example France Telecom, he is a CEO - as far as I understand from ATOS, which is an industrial new tech company, also very close to Siemens. And this is of course something very close to the area of the new commissioner.\"\n\nNew Hungarian candidate Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi will also meet von der Leyen next week.

And I really hope that this view will stay in the future,\" Hungarian MEP Andor Deli (EPP) told our reporter.\n\nRomania is yet to propose a replacement Commissioner candidate as the country is facing its own internal political crisis.\n\nThe Commission's celebrated gender balance is already at risk , as the two new nominees are both men.", "description": "New nominees, gender parity at risk - we look at how the new Commission is shaping up.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/81/60/1000x563_cmsv2_9b488562-c474-543a-b51b-22ed81fdc3dc-4258160.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
