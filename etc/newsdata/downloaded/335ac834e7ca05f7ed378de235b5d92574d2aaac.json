Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is a \u201ccougar\u201d who hired a male escort.\n\nThe event had the trademarks of many of their previously, notoriously inept political stunts, including attempts to smear former Special Counsel Robert Mueller and 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg with fake sexual assault claims. Those earlier, obviously fake smear attempts had become Twitter punchlines, and made Wohl and Burkman into laughingstocks even among many of their allies on the right.\n\nBut this time, the accuser they were touting was a retired Marine.\n\nKelvin Whelly, a self-described Marine-turned-male-escort, stepped up to the podium alongside Wohl and Burkman. Without any proof, he claimed to have engaged in a series of increasingly ludicrous sex acts with Warren after meeting her on male escort site \u201cCowboys4Angels.\u201d\n\nWohl and Burkman repeatedly leaned on Whelly\u2019s military service as a \u201ccombat veteran\u201d in Afghanistan as proof that his allegation was credible.\n\n\u201cAre you laughing at our troops?\u201d Burkman yelled at a crowd of hecklers who assembled on the street in front of Burkman\u2019s Alexandria townhouse that has become a familiar setting for their stunts. \u201cDo you think his service in Afghanistan is funny?\u201d\n\nIn the press conference, Whelly said he had served in Afghanistan in 2012 and claimed he was injured in combat but never received a Purple Heart because he didn\u2019t fill out the paperwork.\n\n\u201cIn 2012, we were stationed in Afghanistan,\u201d Whelly said.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Beast after the press conference, Whelly went further, telling a story about losing members of his group in combat after his convoy was hit by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan. Whelly even claimed to have been grazed by a bullet in combat himself, insisting that he bandaged the wound himself with duct tape.\n\n\u201cSome stuff happened. It\u2019s quite personal, it\u2019d take a lot more liquor for me to talk about it,\u201d Whelly said, his voice choking up. \u201cLost some men, essentially.\u201d\n\nAccording to Whelly\u2019s service record, though, his claim to combat service is not consistent with military\u2019s own information. Service records provided by the Marines Corps and reviewed by The Daily Beast confirm that Whelly was in the Marines from 2014 to 2016, but that he never deployed to Afghanistan or anywhere else.\n\nWhelly and Wohl didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Burkman claimed that Whelly\u2019s DD-214, the form listing his entire service record, wouldn\u2019t be available until later on Friday afternoon.\n\nThere are other reasons to question Whelly\u2019s story. Garren James, the owner of male escort site Cowboys4Angels, told Rolling Stone on Thursday that Whelly had never even applied to work at the company.\n\n\u201cEverything that he\u2019s saying doesn\u2019t even make sense,\u201d James later told The Daily Beast.\n\nJames added that Whelly\u2019s claim to have messaged Warren on the site was ridiculous, because escorts and clients can\u2019t communicate through Cowboys4Angels.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really not the type of guy that we would hire, even if he applied,\u201d James said. \u201cFor him to use our agency to try to get clout is just absolutely ridiculous.\u201d\n\nBut the most serious factual questions about Whelly concern his Marine service, and how his claim that he served in combat in Afghanistan conflicts with his service record.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why Whelly\u2019 claimed to be in the Marines in 2012, when his service records show that he joined in 2014. The 2014 date is further backed up by posts from the summer of 2014 on Whelly\u2019s own Instagram, which show him counting down the days until he went to Marine training in August 2014.\n\nDespite the fact that Whelly never served in Afghanistan, all three men frequently played up his bogus combat status to bolster the allegations against Warren. When a crowd of roughly two dozen hecklers pointed out that Whelly was obviously lying about his fake relationship with Warren and laughing shirtless Instagram pics they said cast doubt on his story. Burkman shamed them by pointing to Whelly\u2019s military record.\n\n\u201cYou owe respect for a Marine that\u2019s fought for his country,\u201d Burkman said. \u201cI think it\u2019s shameful behavior.\u201d\n\nWohl, who is facing a felony charge in California, urged Whelly away from the mic to \u201cshow these guys up\u201d and discuss his Marine service to shut down his detractors. Whelly went on to claim that he had served in Afghanistan in 2012.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to honoring service here, we don\u2019t play around,\u201d Wohl told the crowd, before attempting and failing to have a security guard remove a heckler from Burkman\u2019s sidewalk. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re going to keep impugning this serviceman\u2019s service, fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan\u2026\u201d\n\nWohl trailed off, and attempted to get one heckler questioning Whelly\u2019s service record with chants of \u201cstolen valor\u201d removed by a security guard. The security guard refused, on the grounds that the man was on a public sidewalk.\n\nCracks began to appear in the operatives\u2019 claims about Whelly\u2019s service even before the press conference began. In a tweet hyping up the event, Burkman claimed Whelly was a \u201cUSMC Combat Veteran who earned a Purple Heart in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nOnce at the podium, though, Whelly quickly corrected Burkman, claiming that while he had been wounded, he had never completed the paperwork required to receive the award.\n\n\u201cI do not have a Purple Heart,\u201d Whelly siad. \u201cYou have to put in for a Purple Heart, even if you\u2019re wounded, you have to put in for a Purple Heart.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t convince a number of veterans in the crowd, who began angrily accusing Whelly of fabricating his service record.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no stolen valor here,\u201d Wohl said.\n\nBurkman later deleted the tweet.\n\nWhelly elaborated on his fictitious Afghanistan service in an interview after the press conference with The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cNow this is a US Marine,\u201d Wohl said during the interview in an attempt to promote Whelly as a credible witness. \u201cWhere were you in Afghanistan? Were you in Kandahar?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was in Kandahar, how the fuck did you know that?\u201d Whelly responded. \u201cI did not tell you that. That\u2019s one thing I did not tell him. Kandahar Valley, 2012, was there for 9 months.\u201d\n\nWhelly told The Daily Beast that he had gone on excursions to meet with Afghan elders to gather information on the Taliban.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to talk to the people in the area, the village elders, obviously, because they\u2019ve a completely different culture than we do. We\u2019re trying to find out where \u201cTali\u201d is \u2014 Taliban. And they pretty much say, \u2018no no no, Tali not here.\u2019 We present them with money, they say, \u2018Taliban is there.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhelly claimed, in another allegation not backed up by his service record, that he had been manning a turret in Afghanistan when his convoy was hit by an IED. In fact, according to his record, Whelly, whose division was based in Hawaii, was likely thousands of miles away.\n\n\u201cWe got a firefight conflict from the left and right,\u201d Whelly said, his voice choking up. \u201cAn IED went off and we lost our guys.\u201d\n\nWhelly went on to claim that he had visited the funerals of Marines killed in Afghanistan and feeling the emotional pressure of the loss.\n\n\u201cIn the Marines Corps, we can\u2019t stop,\u201d Whelly said. \u201cYou lose men \u2014 it does matter, but the emotional aspect doesn\u2019t hit you until you have the time to sit down.\u201d\n\nWhelly also claimed to have been grazed by a bullet in combat, but never saw a medic over the injury, instead wrapping it in duct tape.\n\n\u201cI myself was shot, but I never wore a Purple Heart because I never admitted to being shot,\u201d Whelly said. \u201cNobody assessed my wound, I assessed my wound.\u201d\n\nWhelly said he needed to hastily dress the injury with duct tape\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m wounded, and I\u2019m on the turret, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s the main deterrent for those who are coming at my men,\u201d Whelly said. \u201cSo I have to keep them away. So my wounds didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nBurkman again cited Whelly\u2019s nonexistent combat service as a reason to take his bogus claims against Warren seriously.\n\n\u201cThis guy\u2019s wounded in Kandahar,\u201d Burkman said. \u201cThey should give him a chance to tell his story.\u201d", "description": "Kelvin Whelly claimed to be a Marine combat vet who took fire in Afghanistan.
