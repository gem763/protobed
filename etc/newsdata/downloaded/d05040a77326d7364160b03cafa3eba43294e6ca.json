One of the biggest critiques was made by celebrity hairstylist Vernon Francois, who blamed the incident on professionals who were incapable of styling black hair.\n\n\u201cThis beautiful young girl\u2019s #kinky hair appears to have had very little to no attention yet all of her counterparts have clearly sat in front of someone who was more [than] capable of styling other hair textures,\u201d Francois captioned a screenshot on his Instagram. \u201cMy heart breaks imagining yet another girl from my community sitting in front of a mirror being ignored by the team around her, left to her own devices because someone didn\u2019t know how to handle her texture.\u201d\n\nVideo: How to Tame Your Kinky, Coily, Curly and Wavy Hair\n\nThe hairstylist to celebrities like Lupita Nyong'o and Willow Smith went on to point out that the photos had to have gone through an extensive approval process before being published on the company\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s breathtaking to me that not one person looked at this shot and had the same reaction that the internet seems to be feeling since the campaign broke,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTHAT IS AN ISSUE.\u201d\n\nPlenty of others took to Twitter to share their thoughts about the model\u2019s hair.\n\nExcuse me @hm I just want to talk, because natural is fine but not doing her hair properly/at all is not... pic.twitter.com/smC6iyzyaq \u2014 shainanigans \ud83c\udf3b (@SimplyShai_xo) September 20, 2019\n\nApparently @hm thinks allowing this African American young lady\u2019s hair to look like this in their AD is acceptable! I find this disrespectful! This is a clear example that there are no people of color working at the higher level because they would have not allowed this#DoBetter pic.twitter.com/dpvyMwlyqc \u2014 Shannon Sheree (@ShannonSheree) September 20, 2019\n\nH&M AT IT AGAIN \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02\n\nThey wrong for that. Where the child mama? I hope she sue them for public humiliation, defamation of character, and discrimination \ud83d\ude24\n\nThey could had a stylist touch this child hair.

I don\u2019t understand even if the parents were dumb enough to leave their child\u2019s hair like this which I doubt. H&M is one of the biggest fashion retail stores in the world. They couldn\u2019t do anything about her hair?!

It ain\u2019t even about whether her edges need to be laid or not, but if sis hair can\u2019t be *styled* back into a puffball they could\u2019ve easily *styled* a lil fro \u2014 Breezy \u2728 (@BrieGotTheJuice) September 20, 2019\n\nOthers had a different perspective on the ad and shared screenshots of the other young girls photographed for the kids campaign \u2014 all of the young models featured had their hair sloppily pulled back or left down with some frizz.\n\nLet's add context https://t.co/Wqh8tNQCY5 \u2014 They call me (@Ic_ibz) September 20, 2019\n\nHonestly I was upset after seeing just the black girl.\n\nBut then I took my time to check the rest of the kids collection, and they violated every single kid \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02smh pic.twitter.com/aCdLSrBTbf \u2014 Hotgirlsummer is over\ud83d\udc86\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (@BaiiDa) September 20, 2019\n\nSome even criticized those taking aim at the black model, in particular, arguing the callouts targeted specifically at her could be perpetuating the idea that her natural hair isn\u2019t beautiful enough for the campaign while the messy look on other models hasn\u2019t caused the same outrage.", "description": "H&M is facing criticism after photographing a young black model with \"messy\" natural hair for a campaign.
