It doesn\u2019t sound like Clayne will ever be back, as his character seemingly met his end on NCIS: NOLA.\n\nAccording to TV Insider, Cade went missing after trying to help his girlfriend\u2019s son, who had started selling drugs. Lasalle went to Mobile, Alabama to search for Cade, and, unfortunately, they found him.\n\nView photos Photo credit: Skip Bolen More\n\nFirst they discovered a body that was\u2014gulp\u2014burned beyond recognition. So Loretta (CCH Pounder) worked her lab magic, and then sadly confirmed that it was Cade who didn\u2019t make it out alive. The NCIS franchise is certainly known for bringing people back from the dead (hello, Ziva), but it seems like a stretch to think we\u2019ll ever see Cade again, unless it's via a flashback.\n\nThat said, CSI: New York star Eddie Cahill is joining the cast in season 6, and his role is somehow related to Cade. Now that we know where Cade stands, we can start making guesses as to how Eddie is involved. Is he the killer? Is he the key to helping Lasalle unscramble the mystery? Will Lasalle do anything to make up for Cade\u2019s death?\n\nThere\u2019s obviously a lot to unpack here, so we\u2019ll leave you to conjure up your own theories about what\u2019s in store for Lasalle on NCIS: NOLA.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "This is the end of Cade.", "authors": ["Megan Stein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dipTvzhYLL.QOdL2OnQcCQ--~B/aD02MDI7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/country_living_105/81daa2ec24a9b36cf4ba6e00e55ea320", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
