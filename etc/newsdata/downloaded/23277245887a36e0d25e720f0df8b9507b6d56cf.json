Ron Johnson\u2019s conspiracy-filled defense of Trump.", "language": "en", "text": "On Friday, a powerful Republican senator indicated to the Wall Street Journal that he had been concerned this summer that President Trump was creating a quid pro quo with Ukraine by holding up military aid. But he appeared to regret sharing something so potentially damaging and immediately tried to walk back his statements.\n\nIt was probably not a coincidence then that on Sunday, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, went on TV to try to defend the president. But arguably, he did more damage to the president\u2019s cause by showing just how difficult it is to defend Trump.\n\nIn his interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Johnson refused to answer basic questions about why he was concerned about Trump, instead bringing up a completely unrelated conspiracy theory about a former FBI official. \u201cAnswer the question that I asked you instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you\u2019re not criticizing him,\u201d an exasperated host Chuck Todd says at one point.\n\nThe interview underscored that, to defend Trump amid revelations of a whistleblower complaint and diplomatic text messages alleging that the president used his power to pressure a foreign country for political gain, Republicans such as Johnson and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) increasingly have to ignore or ditch the facts altogether.\n\nHere are three key excerpts from the interview, taken from a rough transcript provided by \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nTODD: Let me start with something you told the Wall Street Journal late last week. You had said when Mr. Sondland \u2014 Gordon Sondland seemed to imply that \u2014 the frozen military aid was connected to a promise by Zelensky for investigations, you said, \u201cAt that suggestion, I winced. My reaction was, \u2018Oh God. I don\u2019t want to see those two things combined.\u2019\u201d Why did you wince and what did you mean by \u201cthose two things combined?\u201d JOHNSON: Well, first of all, your setup piece was \u2014 you know, typically, very unbiased. But, you know, let me first, before I started answering all the detailed questions, let me just talk about why I\u2019m pretty sympathetic with what President Trump has gone through. You know, I\u2019m 64 years old. I have never in my lifetime seen a president, after being elected, not having some measure of well-wishes from his opponents. I\u2019ve never seen a president\u2019s administration be sabotaged from the day after election. I\u2019ve never seen \u2014 no measure of honeymoon whatsoever. And so what President Trump\u2019s had to endure, a false accusation \u2014 by the way, you\u2019ve got John Brennan on \u2014 you ought to ask Director Brennan what did Peter Strzok mean when he texted Lisa Page on December 15th, 2016?\n\nThis is the first question in the interview, and Todd spends the rest of it \u2014 nine minutes \u2014 trying to get Johnson to answer it. As Todd goes on to say, it is a basic question. He\u2019s asking Johnson to repeat and elaborate on what Johnson told the Wall Street Journal: A high-level diplomat, Gordon Sondland, who appeared to be doing Trump\u2019s bidding in Ukraine, according to text messages, privately told Johnson that military aid was tied to Ukraine agreeing \u201cto get to the bottom of what happened in 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt that suggestion, I winced,\u201d Johnson told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cMy reaction was, \u2018Oh, God. I don\u2019t want to see those two things combined.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTodd wants to know why Johnson was unhappy with that. Johnson doesn\u2019t answer the question. He responds by lamenting that Trump didn\u2019t have \u201csome measure of well-wishes from his opponents\u201d and that his administration was \u201csabotaged\u201d and brings up former intelligence officials whom Trump has made conservative lightning rods. He is, in other words, reiterating Trump\u2019s talking points rather than criticizing the president.\n\n2. TODD: Senator\u2014 JOHNSON: \u2014Special counsel appointed that has hampered his entire investigation\u2014 TODD: Senator? JOHNSON: \u2014his entire\u2014 his entire\u2014 his entire administration. And now, once he\u2019s been\u2014 that was proven false, he would like to know and I would like to know and I know his supporters would like to know, where did this all come from? Who planted that false story? TODD: Senator\u2014 JOHNSON: Who leaked? You know, I\u2014 I have\u2014 I have my third letter into the Inspector General of the Intelligence\u2014 TODD: All right, Senator\u2014 JOHNSON: \u2014Committee, asking to just confirm\u2014 just confirm, are you investigating those leaks that Peter Strzok talked about in that\u2014 TODD: All right, Senator\u2014 JOHNSON: \u2014text to Lisa Page\u2014 TODD: \u2014I have no idea why\u2014 JOHNSON: We\u2019re gettin\u2019\u2014 no, that\u2019s\u2014 that\u2019s\u2014 TODD: \u2014why\u2014 JOHNSON: \u2014a setup. It is entirely\u2014 TODD: \u2014why a Fox\u2014 JOHNSON: \u2014relevant to this point. TODD: \u2014why a Fox News conspiracy, propaganda stuff is popping up on here.\n\nMore than anything, this section of the interview shows just how much Republicans in Congress think they need to ingratiate themselves to Trump.\n\nJohnson is a member of the Senate Ukraine Caucus and chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He also sits on the Senate\u2019s Foreign Relations Committee. In addition, he\u2019s a member of a separate but coequal branch of government. He had a vested interest in getting security aid to Ukraine approved by members of Congress in both parties. We know based on his own words that he was concerned that Trump was holding it up.\n\nYet, rather than acknowledge that on camera, Johnson tries to deflect by throwing out false summaries of the Mueller report \u2060 \u2014 that the allegations were \u201cproven false\u201d \u2060 \u2014 conspiracy theories that someone \u201cplanted\u201d the allegations of Russian collusion at the center of the special counsel investigation and by naming a former FBI official who was no fan of Trump but was ancillary to the investigations into his campaign. At one point, Johnson refuses to answer whether he trusts the CIA and the FBI, two agencies he oversees and works with in his role in the Senate.\n\nMore importantly, none of this has anything to do with Ukraine. Johnson was talking fast, tossing out these distractions like roadblocks to a journalist determined to get a legitimate answer.\n\nWATCH: @SenRonJohnson is asked why he winced.@chucktodd: \"I have no idea why we're going here. ... Can we please answer the question I asked you instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you're not criticizing him?\" #MTP pic.twitter.com/52ZbGaybhI \u2014 Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) October 6, 2019\n\n3. TODD: ... Why did you wince? JOHNSON: ... Because I didn\u2019t want those connected. And I wanted \u2014 I was supporting the aid, as is Senator Murphy, as is everybody that went to that initial inauguration. But here\u2019s the salient point of why I came forward. When I asked the president about that, he completely denied it. He adamantly denied it. He vehemently, angrily denied it. He said, \u201cI\u2019d never do that.\u201d So that is the piece of the puzzle I\u2019m here to report today that, unlike the narrative of the press that President Trump wants to dig up dirt on his 2020 opponent, what he wants is he wants is an accounting of what happened in 2016. Who set him up? Did things spring from Ukraine? ...\n\nI\u2019ve bolded the section where Johnson finally answers the first question Todd asked. Johnson allows that he did not want military aid and \u201cinvestigations into 2016\u201d connected. He said he wanted the aid to go to Ukraine, with no conditions. This is the second time Johnson acknowledges that he thought Trump was doing something with which he did not agree. Aside from this interview, Johnson has twice made clear that he knew about allegations of a quid pro quo \u2014 military aid for investigating election conspiracy theories held by Trump \u2014 and that he heard it from the highest levels of U.S. diplomacy with Ukraine.\n\nJohnson goes on to explain the reason he shared this in the first place. He was trying to say that he had asked Trump whether there was a quid pro quo, and Trump had denied it. It was his second apparent defense of Trump that missed the mark, and Johnson is struggling mightily to get out from under that.", "description": "After admitting that he finds the allegations against President Trump troubling, Johnson threw out conspiracy theories like roadblocks to avoid repeating it in an interview on NBC.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2SBDmF2civIfzgbunNd3W7Nk1r8=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-06-2019/t_4a5c14bb33e14d4e92ae0fe224e24489_name_20191006_sundayshow_thumbs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
