Mann and Warren recounted when they first met, which was on a late Sunday afternoon at an economics and law conference in Florida.\n\n\"Even from that distance, I was just drawn to her,\" he told CNN's MJ Lee. \"She was so just lively, so animated, so engaged. And I just fell for her from 25 yards out before even meeting her.\"\n\nThe two bonded over similar upbringings without a lot of money and their love for academia, as both Warren and Mann worked as college professors, CNN reported.\n\nRead more: Photos capture how Elizabeth Warren rose from a nearly broke Midwestern upbringing to a top Democratic presidential contender \u2014 and Wall Street's worst enemy\n\nMonths after they first met, Warren watched Mann teach a course at University of Connecticut. After the lecture room cleared out, Mann asked Warren what she thought of the class, to which she responded, \"'What can I say? Will you marry me?'\"\n\nAnd Mann said yes.\n\nThose close to the couple described Mann as more calm and soft-spoken, contrasting his energetic and passionate partner, and Warren said she wouldn't have it any other way.\n\n\"I don't want to be married to somebody like me,\" she told CNN. \"I want to be married to somebody like him.\"\n\nMann primarily plays a behind-the-scenes role in Warren's campaign \u2014 notably as a manager for Bailey, the couple's 16-month-old golden retriever. But Warren credits her husband as the person she unwinds with at the end of a long day of campaigning.\n\n\"I always know the last person I'll have a good conversation with, the last person I'll talk to before I go to sleep, is you,\" Warren said during the CNN interview.\n\nMann described his marriage to the senator as an \"adventure,\" and described how Warren becoming a leader in the 2020 Democratic pool has changed their day-to-day lives.\n\n\"Certainly back then, I had no idea what it would look like \u2014 only that we would do it,\" Mann told CNN. \"Every part of it remains an adventure, so I stand by that statement.\"", "description": "2020 candidate Elizabeth Warren and her husband discuss their relationship in the couple's first joint interview since the beginning of her campaign.", "authors": ["Lauren Frias"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9299992e22af54372dd857?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
