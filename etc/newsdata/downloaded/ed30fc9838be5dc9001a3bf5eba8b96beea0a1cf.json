The problem is far, far deeper, though, and it extends way beyond the local situation.\n\nThere is a kind of toxic debt embedded in much of the infrastructure that American built during the 20th century. For decades, corporate executives, as well as city, county, state, and federal officials, not to mention voters, have decided against doing the routine maintenance and deeper upgrades to ensure that electrical systems, roads, bridges, dams, and other infrastructure can function properly under a range of conditions. Kicking the can down the road like this is often seen as the profit-maximizing or politically expedient option. But it\u2019s really borrowing against the future, without putting that debt on the books.\n\nIn software development, engineers have long noted that taking the easy way out of coding problems builds up what they call \u201ctechnical debt,\u201d as the tech journalist Quinn Norton has written.\n\nLike other kinds of debt, this debt compounds if you don\u2019t deal with it, and it can distort the true cost of decisions. If you ignore it, the status quo looks cheaper than it is. At least until the off-the-books debt is revealed.\n\nPG&E\u2019s balance sheets are now fully on view, thanks to the company\u2019s massive liabilities from recent fires, which have landed it in bankruptcy court. Pressed by new climatic conditions, PG&E\u2019s system has entered a new era. Utility officials have admitted that large-scale power shutoffs\u2014during which tens or hundreds of thousands of people lose power for days\u2014will be a regular feature of fall life for a decade. Seeing as the company is in bankruptcy, it will probably keep asking to raise rates. So it\u2019s likely that PG&E customers will be living with higher rates, rolling blackouts, and the possibility of power lines starting new fires. And that\u2019s the optimistic scenario, which assumes that the company can actually scrape together enough money to upgrade its system. No matter what decisions anyone makes now, everyone hooked up to the grid in northern California is likely going to suffer worse service even as we all collectively pay more to harden the system against fire. This is what runaway technical debt looks like.\n\nAlmost everywhere you look in the built environment, there are toxic technical debt bubbles growing and growing and growing. This true of privately maintained systems like PG&E\u2019s and publicly maintained systems like Chicago\u2019s Department of Water Management. It\u2019s extremely true of roads: Soon, perhaps 50 percent of Bay Area roads will be in some state of disrepair, not to mention the deeper work that must occur to secure the roadbeds, not just the asphalt on top.\n\nThen there are the sewers and the wastewater plants. Stormwater drains. Levees. And just regular old drinking water. Per-capita federal funding for water infrastructure has fallen precipitously since the 1970s. Cities are forced to make impossible decisions between funding different services. And even when they do have the money they need, officials make bad or corrupt decisions. So, water systems in the U.S. have built up a trillion dollar technical debt, which must be paid over the next 25 years. The problem is particularly acute in the Great Lakes states. One investigation by American Public Media found that between 2007 and 2018, Chicago residents\u2019 water bills had tripled andCleveland\u2019s had doubled. In Detroit, a city with a median income of less than $27,000, the average family paid $1,151 for water. At these rates, poor residents are far more likely to have their water shut off, and the systems still aren\u2019t keeping up with the maintenance they need. Runaway technical debt makes it nearly impossible to pay the \u201cinterest,\u201d which is just keeping the system running, let alone to start paying down the principal or start new capital projects.", "description": "Climate change will soon expose a crippling problem embedded in the nation\u2019s infrastructures.
