Carl and Ellie from Up\n\nCarl and Ellie are officially one of the sweetest and most endearing couples in the history of cinema, so dressing up as them for Halloween could be a great way for you and your partner to demonstrate your love for one another.\n\nAdmittedly, this costume isn\u2019t very scary, but it\u2019s a winning costume idea for any avid Pixar fans.\n\n2. Eleven and Mike from Stranger Things\n\nTake a leaf out of the book of Modern Family star Sarah Hyland by dressing up as the telekinetic Eleven and the adorably sweet Mike Wheeler from hit show Stranger Things.\n\nIt was recently confirmed the sci-fi show would return for a fourth season, with speculation rife as to when it will drop.\n\n3. Hawaiian punch\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love a good pun?\n\nShow some love for the English language (in addition to affection for your partner in crime) with this witty and undeniably cheesy costume.\n\n4. The Doctor and the Tardis\n\nFans of Doctor Who have been showing the programme a lot of love since the Doctor regenerated to be portrayed by Jodie Whittaker in October 2018.\n\nAmong the Doctor\u2019s many companions throughout the show\u2019s 56-year history, one of the most popular pairings of the show is the Doctor and the time traveller\u2019s faithful Tardis.\n\n5. Tetris pieces\n\n\u201cYou complete me,\u201d Tom Cruise tells Ren\u00e9e Zellweger in the 1996 film Jerry Maguire.\n\nIf you feel the same way about your other half, then show it by dressing up as pieces from the addictive 1980s arcade game.\n\n6. Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction\n\nEver since Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Pulp Fiction was released, couples have taken Halloween as the perfect opportunity to dress up as John Travolta and Uma Thurman and to recreate their famous dance scene from the 1994 film.\n\nWhile this costume may be overdone, it\u2019s a classic and very easy to replicate.\n\n7. Baseball bat\n\nAnother punny costume, this time in the form of a popular American sport.\n\nIf you think your significant other is a catch, then this is the couple costume for you.\n\n8. Katy Perry and Left Shark\n\nWhile the media relishes writing about Katy Perry\u2019s relationship with Orlando Bloom, one of her most iconic partnerships came in 2015 when the singer performed at the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments of the performance came when a backup dancer, fondly known as \u201cLeft Shark\u201d, was spotted dancing in an uncoordinated manner on the stage, spawning a myriad of memes.\n\n9. Morticia and Gomez Addams\n\nIf you want to truly go peak Halloween, then donning the glad rags of Morticia and Gomez Addams of the Addams family is your best bet.\n\nThis couple has stood the test of time, first appearing in a television series in the 1960s.\n\n10. Kelly and Yorkie from 'San Junipero'\n\n'San Junipero' is one of the most highly rated episodes of science fiction series Black Mirror, winning two Primetime Emmy Awards in 2017.\n\nTake inspiration from the 1980s by dressing up as the episode\u2019s main characters Kelly and Yorkie, portrayed by Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Mackenzie Davis.\n\n11. Jack and Sally from The Nightmare Before Christmas\n\nIn 2017, Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum succumbed to their daughter\u2019s wishes by dressing up as Sally and Jack for Halloween, from Tim Burton\u2019s stop-motion animated musical The Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\nConsidering Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King of \u201cHalloween Town\u201d, this costume is undoubtedly the epitome of the festive occasion.\n\n12. Barbie and Ken\n\nIn 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z decided to dress up as Barbie and Ken for Halloween.\n\nIf this costume is good enough for one of the most influential couples in entertainment, then it\u2019s good enough for you.\n\n13. Harry Potter and the Golden Snitch\n\nIn Quidditch, the Golden Snitch is the most prized ball of them all, worth 150 points if caught by the team\u2019s Seeker.\n\nIf you have no idea what any of those words mean, then this probably isn\u2019t the costume for you and your significant other. However, if you\u2019re a diehard Potterhead (Harry Potter fan), then this look is definitely a Keeper.\n\n14. Sully and Boo from Monsters, Inc.\n\nTake a trip down memory lane by dressing up as Sully and Boo from Pixar\u2019s Monsters, Inc.\n\nAll you need is some pink and blue clothing, some hair bunchies, some purple spots and some horns. Simple.\n\n15.

Chuck Noland and Wilson the volleyball from Cast Away\n\nIn 2000, Tom Hanks was nominated for an Oscar for his role as Chuck Noland in the survival film Cast Away.\n\nWilson the volleyball, Chuck\u2019s only companion while stranded on a desert island for four years, was received so well by film audiences that it has its own IMDb page.\n\n17. Netflix and chill\n\nYes, this couple\u2019s costume has been done a million times over and is unequivocally clich\u00e9.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re lost for ideas, it\u2019s a safe bet and very easy to create from scratch.\n\n18. Marty McFly and Doc Brown from Back to the Future\n\nPay tribute to one of the most beloved films of the 1980s by dressing up as Marty McFly and Doc Brown from Back to the Future.\n\nWhile the time-travelling adventure may have been released more than three decades ago, one of its stars, Christopher Lloyd, hasn\u2019t ruled out another film in the franchise.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to be in a fourth film if they could come up with the right idea that extends the story and does it as well as the first three,\u201d he told Phoenix New Times in 2018.", "description": "With Halloween just around the corner, now is the time to put your creative hat on and start thinking about who or what you\u2019re going to transform into for the spookiest night of the year.
