What was Biden talking about?\n\nAfter all, the Medicare-for-all plan advanced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) calls for eliminating premiums, deductibles and co-pays. Yet Biden suggests the plan would raise deductibles.\n\nBiden\u2019s staff acknowledges that he misspoke, repeatedly, in this passage:\n\n* He meant to say the plan would double the federal budget, except for interest on the debt, not that it was twice the federal budget.\n\n* He meant to say a tax on employers was like a deductible from your paycheck. (The line he used in the last primary debate was: \u201cIt\u2019s going to cost you in your pay \u2014 there will be a deductible in your paycheck\u201d).\n\n* He meant to say the employer tax was 7.5 percent, not \u201c5 percent and 4 percent.\u201d\n\nBiden emphasizes the higher taxes that Medicare-for-all would impose while ignoring the fact that for many middle-class Americans (if you accept Sanders\u2019s math) the change may result in higher incomes and lower health-care costs. It\u2019s a classic political gambit to focus on only half the equation.\n\nRead the full check here.", "description": "Twelve candidates are on stage tonight at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, outside Columbus.
