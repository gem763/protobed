In response to the letter, a Facebook spokesperson stated:\n\nFacebook\u2019s culture is built on openness so we appreciate our employees voicing their thoughts on this important topic. We remain committed to not censoring political speech, and will continue exploring additional steps we can take to bring increased transparency to political ads.\n\nIn the letter, employees argued that Facebook\u2019s decision not to fact-check candidates\u2019 ads runs contrary to its two-year effort to fight misinformation on the platform. The letter also asked Facebook to better distinguish political ads from user-created content and to limit political advertisers\u2019 ability to address ads to focus on custom-designed audiences, such as targeting specific areas or ethnicities.\n\n\u201cCurrently we restrict targeting for housing and education and credit verticals due to a history of discrimination,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe look forward to working towards solutions together,\u201d the letter concludes. \u201cThis is still our company.\u201d\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
