The plan will undergo a period of public comment before being finalized, and environmental groups pledged court action to try to block repeal of the limits.\n\nThe proposal \u201cremoves unnecessary and duplicative regulatory burdens from the oil and gas industry,\u201d EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said.\n\nIt was the latest move by President Donald Trump to support oil, gas and coal output by unwinding environmental regulations put in place by his predecessor President Barack Obama.\n\nThe EPA said it will keep rules issued in 2012 that limit emissions known as volatile organic compounds that cause smog and also control methane emissions. EPA official Anne Idsal told reporters she expects methane emissions to fall in coming years due to the 2012 rule and as energy companies on their own minimize leaks of methane due to its value as the main component of natural gas.\n\nEnvironmentalists say energy companies do not always do enough to control leaks, especially whenever low natural gas prices make it cheaper to release the methane.\n\nSome large energy companies including BP and Exxon Mobil also favor robust federal regulation of methane. They reason that regulatory certainty is preferable to a patchwork of varying rules by states and legal challenges by environmentalists. BP has said it is already taking steps to limit methane emissions.\n\nTrump, who insists he is an environmentalist, has also relaxed rules on carbon emissions from vehicles and intends to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change.\n\nConcern about climate has spiked amid fires in the Arctic and the Amazon rainforest, melting of ice in Greenland, and as Hurricane Dorian threatened Florida. Democrats seeking their party\u2019s nomination in the 2020 U.S. presidential election will participate in a series of town halls on climate next week.\n\nSEE THEM IN COURTIn 2016, Obama\u2019s EPA issued the first rule specifically limiting methane emissions from new oil and gas fracking operations including transport equipment. Thursday\u2019s proposal would rescind that and specific regulations on existing sources of methane.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Pump jacks operate at sunset in Midland, Texas U.S. February 11, 2019.

API official Erik Milito said it would \u201cprovide the flexibility to develop and deliver affordable and reliable American energy.\u201d\n\nBut the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, 140 global institutional investors representing $5.5 trillion in assets at faith groups, pensions and unions, urged a wide range of energy companies to support the standard.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cThe removal of methane regulations deepens the threat from climate change, increasing economy-wide risks,\u201d the group said.\n\nEnvironmentalists vowed to sue the administration. \u201cIf EPA moves forward with this reckless and sinister proposal, we will see them in court,\u201d said David Doniger, a climate and clean energy specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.", "description": "The Trump administration on Thursday proposed rescinding Obama-era limits on oil and gas industry emissions of methane, one of the main pollutants scientists link to climate change, a move that drew backlash from environmentalists and institutional investors.", "authors": ["Timothy Gardner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190830&t=2&i=1424237641&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7S1BJ"}
