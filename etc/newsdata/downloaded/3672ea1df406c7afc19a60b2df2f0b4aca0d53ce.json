The antidote: handblown topaz glass fixtures by John Pomp Studios in sundry shapes. The unexpected array dangles a note of art-studio cool over the space, which otherwise features quartz countertops, white cabinetry and a pair of buttoned-up Jacobean stools.\n\nIn the last two years, Mr. Stringer has installed four examples of subtly mismatched pendant lighting\u2014typically fixtures of the same color family but in different shapes. The world of kitchen design is wearying of rote choices. \u201cEverything right now is about eclecticism\u2014making the space your own,\u201d said Matthew Quinn, author of \u201cQuintessential Kitchens and Spaces: Volume Two\u201d (Parrish Press). In a black and white kitchen, the Atlanta designer hung assorted shapes of Tom Dixon\u2019s Beat pendants, which are matte black with warm brass interiors. Using groupings of slightly divergent pendants is \u201can opportunity to break the rule but not shatter it,\u201d said Mr. Quinn.\n\nAnother way to distance a kitchen from the three-in-a-row setup that unimaginative condo developers rely on: Hang the fixtures at varying heights. \u201cThis gives a room more dimension. The eye is drawn to different levels, which makes the space look more 3-D,\u201d said New York designer Marina Hanisch.\n\nNonidentical pendant collections come in many hues, shapes, styles and finishes. Curiousa & Curiousa\u2019s open-ended Classic glass pendants come in five shapes and 23 jewellike colors. Said their British designer, Esther Patterson, \u201cThey hit the note of modern but are reflective of vintage and history.\u201d The iconic chandeliers of La Scala in Milan and Moscow\u2019s Bolshoi Theatre inspired the Neverending Glory Czech-crystal pendants for Lasvit. \u201cEvery single shape is different, but together you see the story behind the whole collection,\u201d said co-designer Jan Plech\u00e1\u010d.\n\nStrike a Mismatch 1.

Ms. Lambur noted that the house\u2019s relaxed modernist lines didn\u2019t require staid symmetry.\n\nLED technology enables the design of the aptly named SLAB lights designed by Lukas Peet, nearly flat acrylic rectangles swathed in a choice of cork or colored-wool felt, both sound-deadening. In a townhouse in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Tamara Eaton suspended three sizes of the lights in yellow, green and gray, the smallest at right angles to the larger. \u201cCabinetry can be very monotonous, right?\u201d the New York designer said. \u201cLighting is one of the very few things in a kitchen that can bring sculpture.\u201d\n\nOf course, you can mix up pendants yourself: Zero in on one style but buy a few companionable colors, or mingle similar designs from one brand. If you\u2019ve got a designer\u2019s help, you might even consider three very different fixtures that have some element in common. Orlando designer John McClain had nearly convinced a client to install three pendants that riff on circular forms in three different materials\u2014gray concrete, glass, and unlacquered brass\u2014over their modern kitchen. \u201cThey chickened out at the last second and went with a simple three or four pendants, matching, over the island. Yawn, yawn, yawn,\u201d said the dispirited Mr. McClain.\n\nTo do a m\u00e9lange successfully, Mr. Quinn recommends hanging quite a gang of lights. \u201cIf you have more than two, you start to see, \u2018Oh, this is intentional,\u2019\u201d he said. And because a mix can grab attention, follow the rules for standard installation extra-religiously. Keep dangling lights away from exposed ceiling beams to limit nettlesome shadows. And if your ceiling is less than 8 feet high, find a non-pendant solution.\n\nBut if all systems are go, be bold, said Mr. Quinn. \u201cI always advise clients to go a little wild with lighting, because it is one of the easiest things to change.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
