Getting coins out of the bank", "language": "en", "text": "Today, we are going to play a game. It takes place on a grid with an infinite number of rows and columns, and it starts with three coins in the top left corner of the grid, as illustrated here.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A snapshot of the top left of the grid, which has an infinite number of columns to the right, and an infinite number of rows below.\n\nThe game has one move. At any moment you can remove any coin, and replace it with two coins, one in the cell immediately below the removed coin, and one in the cell immediately to the right of the removed coin. For example, just say we remove the coin two along on the top row, the grid will now look like this:\n\nOne more thing: you are only allowed to remove a coin in the way described above if the cell below that coin and the cell to the right of that coin are empty. In other words, if a coin has an empty cell below it and an empty cell to its right, then you can remove that coin and replace it with two coins, one in the cell below it and one in the cell to its right. That\u2019s it. There are no more rules. Let\u2019s redraw the initial grid with a red line separating the four cells in the upper left corner. These four cells are called the \u2018bank\u2019.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Remember that the grid goes on forever to the right and downwards.\n\nThe challenge: design a strategy that gets all the coins out of the bank. If you can\u2019t, prove that it is impossible.\n\nGet some coins from your pocket or purse. Draw a grid. Play around with the coins on the grid. The challenge should be quite easy, right?\n\nWarning: this is a tricky puzzle. But it\u2019s worth the effort. The solution is spectacular, involving a simple insight. Well, simple, once you know it.\n\nThe problem was devised by the Argentine mathematician Carlos Sarraute. As the writer of a column about puzzles, I am constantly looking for new problems. Most of the time, what I come across are variations of puzzles I have seen before. This one, however, was completely new to me. It blew me away.\n\nPLEASE NO SPOILERS and I\u2019ll be back with the solution and a discussion at 5pm UK time today.\n\nIn other puzzle-related news, I have a new book out! So You Think You\u2019ve Got Problems? is a compendium of 200 of my favourite brainteasers, together with historical context and discussion of the mathematical ideas involved. I\u2019ve chosen puzzles I find especially ingenious, and that provoke feelings of wonder and surprise. It\u2019s out next month, but you can pre-order here.\n\nI set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I\u2019m always on the look-out for great puzzles.
