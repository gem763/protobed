The ministry will continue to investigate the potential spread of the ants.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Venomous fire ants could spread in Japan, as the recent discovery of about 50 queen ants at a Tokyo port suggests the invasive alien insect from South America has likely taken root, according to an analysis by a national research institute.
