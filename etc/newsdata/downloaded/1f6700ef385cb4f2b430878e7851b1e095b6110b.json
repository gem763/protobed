It adds that \"overweight and obesity continue to rise.\"\n\nFore said millions of children eat an unhealthy diet because they don't have a choice.\n\n\"The way we understand and respond to malnutrition needs to change,\" Fore said. \"It is not just about getting children enough to eat, it is above all about getting them the right food to eat. That is our common challenge today.\"\n\nUNICEF says \"financial incentives\" should reward the increase of healthy and affordable foods. It says \"financial disincentives\" on unhealthy foods can help improve children's diets.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nUNICEF report: https://features.unicef.org/state-of-the-worlds-children-2019-nutrition", "description": "One-third of children worldwide under age 5 \u2014 about 200 million youngsters \u2014 are either undernourished or overweight, undermining their full potential to grow and develop, the U.N. children's agency said in a report Tuesday.
