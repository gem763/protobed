REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\n\u201cThe Aeronauts\u201d reunites Felicity Jones and Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne as pilot Amelia Wren and real-life scientist James Glaisher in their hot-air balloon expedition to reach unrivaled heights.\n\n\u201cThe Aeronauts\u201d will have a mere two-week run in theaters starting Dec. 6, before launching on Amazon Prime Video, a shift from an earlier plan to debut the film exclusively in IMAX Corporation theaters for a week before a Nov. 1 theatrical release.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all changed, isn\u2019t it,\u201d Redmayne said to Reuters on the red carpet on Sunday, saying that streaming services like Amazon give access to people who do not live near cinemas or cannot get to them.\n\n\u201cBut obviously, I still love the experience of sitting in a dark room with other people and being bombarded with stories that you experience as a community,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I hope there\u2019s room for both.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, Cineplex Entertainment\u2019s 14-screen Scotiabank Theatre, one of the festival venues, is not screening any of Netflix\u2019s eight productions or Amazon Studios\u2019 seven films.\n\nThe theater is the venue for most of the festival\u2019s press and industry screenings. The two streaming services\u2019 press and industry screenings are held at the TIFF Bell Lightbox location, a spokeswoman for the festival told Reuters.\n\nCineplex prefers to screen movies from studios \u201cwho understand and appreciate the importance of the theatrical release model,\u201d a Cineplex spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.\n\nNetflix pulled out of May\u2019s Cannes Film Festival after organizers banned its films from competition for its refusal to release them in cinemas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made so many films that they just don\u2019t get seen that it\u2019s so lovely to be making something that you know it\u2019s so easy to access and people all over the world will be able to see it,\u201d Jones said on the red carpet.\n\n\u201cThe Aeronauts\u201d story is based on a Sept. 5, 1862, hot-air balloon expedition by Glaisher and balloonist Henry Coxwell which broke the world record for flight altitude.\n\nRedmayne and Jones co-starred in \u201cThe Theory of Everything,\u201d for which Redmayne won an Oscar for his portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking. Jones, who played Hawking\u2019s ex-wife Jane, was nominated for an Oscar.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re old friends,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think we really push each other. We probably drive each other crazy. We\u2019re both meticulous and detail oriented and we don\u2019t stop until we feel that we\u2019ve done something special.\u201d", "description": "Amazon Studios' \"The Aeronauts\" had its Toronto International Film Festival premiere on Sunday amid concerns about the impact of streaming service providers on the traditional theatrical-release model.", "authors": ["Nichola Saminather", "Robert Mezan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427729287&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8710L-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
