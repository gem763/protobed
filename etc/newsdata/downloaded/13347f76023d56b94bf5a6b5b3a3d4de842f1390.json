How Might It End?", "language": "en", "text": "Source: iStock/ZamoraA\n\nMany so-called \"Ethereum Killers\" (EKs) plan major announcements in the coming quarters. How it might change the competitiive landscape? Co-founder of Placeholder, a New York venture firm that specializes in cryptoassets, Chris Burniske, weighed in.\n\nMajor cryptocurrency exchange Binance, launched its own blockchain, Binance Chain, back in April, hosting its first project, Mithril (MITH), that moved from Ethereum (ETH) just a day later. A number of tokens followed, leaving the Ethereum blockchain. This is the type of action that some fear may spell Ethereum's demise. But Binance is far from being the only one to whom the Cryptoverse assigned the EK title. Many will remember that this list includes Tron, EOS, NEO, and Dothereum built atop Polkadot\u2019s technology - among numerous others.\n\nChris Burniske, discusses his expectations for asset prices and the prices of services offered by Ethereum Killers in his recent blog post. He says that \"a high density\" of EKs plan to launch their mainnets and release their assets to the crypto markets in the coming quarters. But it's important to observe and understand this transition of price discovery from the private to public markets, Burniske finds, given that \"many EKs carry billion-dollar anticipated launch values,\" and that the behavior of the new EKs \"will impact the development of the sideways market we\u2019re currently in, as well as the bull market to come.\"\n\nHe argues that:\n\nthe 2017 crypto bubble capitalized a lot of worthwhile experiments even if it was irrationally exuberant;\n\nmost of the EKs to face extreme downward pressure from their attempted listing prices, as has been the case with Algorand \u2019s ALGO and Hashgraph \u2019s HBAR, as most EKs set expectations too high in private markets, and are now attempting to maintain those valuations in a public market;\n\n\u2019s ALGO and \u2019s HBAR, as most EKs set expectations too high in private markets, and are now attempting to maintain those valuations in a public market; the most common means of evaluating cryptonetworks in relation is through their network values; for example, at the start of 2018, Ethereum had a network value higher than USD 130 billion, while un-launched but publicly traded EKs like Cardano and EOS were trading at USD 10-20 billion valuations and above;\n\nETH built liquidity slowly and mining created a cost floor;\n\nindependent of the number of stakeholders, the diversity of ETH's stakeholders is a defensible advantage:\n\nfor the last few years crypto has been stuck in a relatively high-cost innovation environment, but the EKs and Ethereum 2.0 may help it enter a lower-cost epoch.\n\nThe elements Burniske finds may weigh EKs down are:\n\ncontinued wishful thinking for similar valuations as Ethereum due to \u201csuperior technology,\u201d without understanding what\u2019s supported Ethereum\u2019s network capitalization to date; the market\u2019s potential intolerance of inflation, if EKs are unable to develop robust fee markets amongst their users; the emerging game-theoretic nightmare of EKs deploying relatively undifferentiated systems in a short period of time, spreading developers and investors thin, Burniske says.\n\n\u201cIt could get worse before it gets better, as many EKs come to market simultaneously, and supply outstrips demand in the near term,\u201d concludes Burniske, adding: \u201cWhile I don\u2019t expect the EK shakeout to be fun, the public markets checking the private markets is by design, and in the name of optimal allocation of capital and labor. Sometimes a fire must run through the forest in order for saplings to grow again.\u201d\n\nEventful October\n\nMeanwhile, at pixel time (16:15 UTC), ethereum trades at c. USD 163 and is up by 3% in the past 24 hours and down by more than 8% in the past week and by 15.6% in the past month.\n\nNot so long ago, at the beginning of this month, ETH rallied, jumped above the USD 190 level, and reached its highest price this month on October 9th with USD 194. It\u2019s still not its highest price in the last 30 days, though, as that honor belongs to the USD 198 reached at the end of the (in)famous September rally when the downwards correction was already underway.\n\nThat being said, since that highest October price so far, ETH started dropping and, save for the standard fluctuations, hasn\u2019t stopped going down since. In the last week, we\u2019ve seen it fall below USD 180, and fluctuating between USD 171 and USD 177. Its highest price in this period of time was USD 178 that was shortly held on October 17th. Its lowest price in a week was seen yesterday, when it dropped to USD 156.\n\nETH price chart:\n\nThree days ago, we\u2019ve also looked at Ethereum\u2019s Sentscore and found that this market sentiment measure too had dropped by 3.1%, from the score 5/10 to 4.9. It fell further since to the score of 4.8.\n\nMeanwhile, major crypto payments processor, BitPay, announced its support for ether back in September, but it confirmed two days ago that ETH support \u201chas come to the BitPay app and BitPay merchants everywhere.\u201d However, the Cryptoverse has also seen many discussions about ETH 2.0 and it\u2019s an ongoing topic. Angela Walch, a Professor of Law at St. Mary\u2019s University School of Law in San Antonio, and a Research Fellow at the Centre for Blockchain Technologies at University College London, tweeted that it\u2019s \u201cVery curious as to how plans to move to Eth 2.0 are factoring into ETH futures contract decision,\u201d adding \u201cSeems like much of what is known about Ethereum changes fundamentally w/ shift to Eth 2.0, & there is a lot of uncertainty about what the transition will look like.\u201d", "description": "Many so-called \"Ethereum Killers\" (EKs) plan major announcements in the coming quarters.
