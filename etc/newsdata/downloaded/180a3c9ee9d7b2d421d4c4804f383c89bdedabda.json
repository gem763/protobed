The unredacted document ruins the narrative that Trump threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine if they don't investigate his 2020 opponent Joe Biden.\n\nNo problem for Schiff, though. He took a few parts of the phone call out of context for his Twitter audience to suggest that Trump is a mob boss.\n\nThe transcript of the call reads like a classic mob shakedown:\n\n\n\n\u2013 We do a lot for Ukraine\n\n\u2013 There\u2019s not much reciprocity\n\n\u2013 I have a favor to ask\n\n\u2013 Investigate my opponent\n\n\u2013 My people will be in touch\n\n\n\nNice country you got there.\n\n\n\nIt would be a shame if something happened to her. \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 25, 2019\n\nSchiff added in a press conference on Capitol Hill that even if there was no explicit quid pro quo, Trump is still guilty.\n\nHouse Intel Chairman Schiff on Trump-Ukraine call memo: \u201cThe notes of the call reflect a conversation far more damning than I or many others had imagined.\u201d https://t.co/GvBzbbeYIi pic.twitter.com/kZ4mnL0du3 \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) September 25, 2019\n\nSchiff then really turned on the spin. While Trump may not have directly threatened the hold off on military aid for Ukraine, he did bring up Biden at a suspicious time.\n\nZelensky had just mentioned military support and \"immediately thereafter,\" Schiff notes, \"Trump said, 'I have a favor I want to ask of you' and would not let the subject go.\"\n\n\u201cThere is no quid pro quo necessary to betray your country or your oath of office,\" Schiff suggested. \"Even though many read this as a quid pro quo. I\u2019m not concerned whether it is a quid pro quo or not. Ukraine understood what this president wanted.\u201d\n\nBefore the call transcript was even released, Democrats used it to announce a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday. As of this morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi still hadn't read it.\n\nPer the request of Schiff and several others, the DOJ will also release the full whistleblower complaint. Schiff has already made up his mind about that document too.", "description": ".09/25/2019 19:23:30PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/340/80b9d8fe-155a-4a37-8e13-25d5df4004b7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
