Some animals, like cows and sheep, also produce and burp up methane - a powerful greenhouse gas.\n\nThe Committee on Climate Change's official recommendation to government is that a 20% cut in red meat and dairy is needed - the emissions from the other 80% will have to be matched by CO2 that has been captured and stored permanently in order to meet the net zero ambition.\n\nThe report implies a bigger shift in diets could be needed, and says one way to get people to change will be to emphasise the health benefits this could bring.\n\nAnother will be to give people much more information on the environmental impact of different foods. It calls for mandatory carbon impact labelling on products, on till receipts and via shopping websites and apps.\n\nOnce consumers understand the environmental impact of different food choices, the report argues, government should begin to increase the price of foods that involve high emissions. It suggests this could be done by cutting farm subsidies - more than 70% of which go to livestock - and by raising VAT on these products.\n\nHome heating\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Home heating burns a lot of carbon\n\nHome heating is the single biggest challenge in terms of reducing UK emissions, according to Chris Stark of the Committee on Climate Change. It accounts for 21% of a household's carbon footprint and it will be costly to bring it down.\n\nWith 30 million homes and 30 years to decarbonise, he argues, \"simple arithmetic\" suggests we need to \"decarbonise\" one million homes every year, starting now.\n\nThe Behaviour Change report has a whole catalogue of policy recommendations here. As with electric vehicles, decarbonisation of UK electricity creates opportunities for low-carbon heating systems, in particular air-source heat pumps, which extract heat from air outside the home and removes cold air from inside.\n\nThe report recommends a \"rebalancing\" of the tax and regulatory costs on energy, which currently falls more heavily on electricity than gas.\n\nVAT on installation of insulation and low-carbon heating systems should be removed.\n\nAt the same time, consumers need to be offered a range of incentives to encourage the use of low-carbon technology.\n\nAccording to Chris Stark: \"We haven't even started nibbling away at that heat challenge in any real sense. We need a real plan, and the sooner we do the cheaper it will be overall.\"\n\nTransport\n\nImage copyright Murray Mika/Transport for London Image caption Cycle lanes can cut the risk of accidents\n\nTransport currently accounts for 34% of a household's carbon footprint.\n\nThe report calls for a major programme of investment in the rail and bus network, with lower ticket prices and investment in safer cycling.\n\nIt says what's needed is a \"modal shift\" to public transport, walking and cycling and believes the public can be encouraged to do this, in part, because of the health benefits it would bring.\n\nHowever, it recognises the UK's progress in decarbonising electricity creates an opportunity for consumers to reduce emissions by switching to electric vehicles and urges greater subsidies for new electric car purchases.\n\nElectricity companies need to be encouraged to introduce smart EV charging systems so customers can charge their vehicles when electricity is cheap or when renewable power is plentiful and there needs to be a massive rollout of charging infrastructure along motorways and in towns and cities.\n\nAviation\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Measures to cut flight numbers are needed\n\nHere the report says policy-makers need to focus on the 15% of the population that are estimated to take 70% of flights.\n\nIt calls for an \"Air Miles Levy\" to discourage what it calls \"excessive flying\", something the Committee on Climate Change has already proposed.\n\nThe idea is to penalise frequent flyers while not raising prices for people taking an annual holiday.\n\nIt says air miles and frequent flier rewards schemes have to go and passengers need to be given much more information about the emissions generated by flights.\n\nThe BBC Panorama programme Climate Change: What Can We Do? is on BBC One on Monday 14 October (except BBC Scotland)", "description": "The experts tell us that small, easy changes alone will not be enough to combat climate change.", "authors": ["Justin Rowlatt", "Chief Environment Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A004/production/_109046904_1ed3c82b-805a-4553-af7c-bc9c45ec0bc6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
