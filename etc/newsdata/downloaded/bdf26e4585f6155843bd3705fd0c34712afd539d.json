I think Japan is a country that\u2019s really well prepared for different types of natural weather incidents and situations like earthquakes, and when you come and live here there\u2019s an education as soon as you get here.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I\u2019ve actually been here in Miyazaki when one hit and everyone gets on with it, they take the necessary safety precautions and then get going again as soon as they can afterwards.\n\n\u201cI think here in Japan, they\u2019re very resilient people and they\u2019re prepared for different types of incident. They\u2019ve had to go through a lot from some of the earthquakes, but that is one of the things that struck me when I moved here, straight away you get an education wherever you are.\n\n\u201cPeople tell you where there are friends and ex-pats here that will talk to you for different services for what you need, like having everything in the cupboard for what you needed if there is an earthquake so that you\u2019ve always got that. My little boy was always taught at pre-school if he heard the earthquake alarms what to do and he\u2019d straight away climb under the table. People would practice whatever and it\u2019s a country that\u2019s really prepared for things.\u201d\n\nWhile England were able to get straight out of the capital to flee the clutches of Hagibis, many friends, family and fans have not been so lucky. World Rugby have provided information on how to best prepare for the natural disaster and the appropriate news services to follow for latest safety updates.\n\nFor England hooker Jamie George, he was relieved to see his parents leave Tokyo on Thursday to head for safety, while his girlfriend has joined other partners and wives of the squad to leave the capital, but the forward still harbours concerns for the safety of those left there and facing the worst.\n\n\u201cI know people who have flown here just for the weekend,\u201d said George, referencing to the risk of them not seeing any rugby at all despite spending thousands to come to Japan. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously gutted for those guys, trust me we\u2019d much rather be playing as well but I think as difficult as it is it\u2019s a very difficult circumstance, isn\u2019t it?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve have to with the magnitude of the typhoon that\u2019s coming take that into account as well. It\u2019s hugely disappointing for those guys, but it\u2019s just the way it is unfortunately.\n\n\u201cMy parents actually left on Thursday when we found out there wasn\u2019t going to be a game, they\u2019ve flown back to be with my brother who lives in Bangkok, and then my girlfriend headed out of Tokyo with a few of the other girls. They\u2019re a bit out of Tokyo so we don\u2019t have anyone there at the minute, but I\u2019ve got a couple of mates there who are trying to wait it all out.\u201d\n\nWith their game against France on Saturday cancelled, the England squad were put through their paces in a physical training session in front of the Miyazaki public, though Billy Vunipola and Jack Nowell did not train with the rest of the 31-man party as they continue their rehabilitation from injury.", "description": "England\u00a0coach Steve Borthwick expressed his concern for the safety of millions it the firing line of Typhoon Hagibis including friends and family, with the largest tropical cyclone in 60 years bearing down on the Japanese capital.
