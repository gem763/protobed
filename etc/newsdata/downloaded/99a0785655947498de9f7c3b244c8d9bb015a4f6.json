REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian/File Photo\n\nThe hotly-anticipated match between the two old rivals on just the second day of the tournament is set to ignite the World Cup and Hansen is rightly wary of the Springboks following their Rugby Championship victory earlier this year.\n\nUnder Rassie Erasmus, South Africa have seen a dramatic uptick in form and have only lost once in their last seven matches, including a draw with New Zealand in July.\n\nHowever, Hansen is the most experienced coach in world rugby and will be ready to exploit any chances South Africa give his players.\n\n\u201cTheir defensive system has changed a lot. They roll the dice big time,\u201d Hansen said on Monday after training.\n\n\u201cTheir wingers come in off their wings - that\u2019s what rolling the dice is. And they\u2019re good at it. Very, very good at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want them to roll a couple of ones, rather than a pair of sixes,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I do know, South Africa will give us opportunities because they roll the dice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we good enough to take them? Will the weather allow us to take them? We\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d\n\nBIG TEST\n\nWith Italy, Namibia and Canada the other teams in Pool B, regardless Saturday\u2019s result New Zealand and South Africa expect to continue their records of qualifying for the quarter-finals at every World Cup in which they have featured.\n\nHansen was quick to point out Saturday\u2019s match would not define the entire campaign.\n\n\u201cLogic will tell you whoever wins this game, probably wins the pool,\u201d said Hansen.\n\n\u201cBut as we found it in 2011, you don\u2019t have to necessarily win the pool to get into the final. France did it the other way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world (if you lose), and it doesn\u2019t mean you are going to win the World Cup or get into the final because you win this game.\u201d\n\nStill five days out from the match, it is crucial that Hansen keeps a lid on his players\u2019 excitement.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big test match, a big box of chocolates at the end of the week,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t eat them on Sunday (yesterday) because there will be none left for Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to take our time and get our clarity, get our intensity building during the week and arrive Saturday full of energy.\u201d", "description": "New Zealand will be looking to capitalise on any unnecessary risks South Africa choose to take in their World Cup opener on Saturday according to boss Steve Hansen, who is hoping to lead the All Blacks to a third consecutive title in Japan.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430451309&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0V6-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
