It was a Negro League dynasty.", "language": "en", "text": "The Washington Senators last won Major League Baseball\u2019s World Series in 1924 against the New York Giants, four games to three. They went back to the championship round in 1933 but lost to New York, this time in five games.\n\nBut Washington\u2019s last World Series team was the 1948 Homestead Grays, who defeated the Birmingham Black Barons, four games to one, to cap perhaps the most dominant stretch of baseball in American history.\n\nAD\n\nThe Grays, who called both Western Pennsylvania and the District home, won nine straight Negro National League pennants from 1937 to 1945 and 10 pennants in 12 seasons from 1937 to 1948, considered a greater feat than winning a World Series because the championship matchups were not always an annual event. The 1948 series was the last one played, and while the circuit was waning, the talent remained imposing. The Grays started Hall of Famer Buck Leonard at first base. The Barons started a 17-year-old Willie Mays in center field.\n\nAD\n\nWith the Washington Redskins using Griffith Stadium to host the Pittsburgh Steelers, the teams met for Game 1, a 3-2 win for Homestead, in Kansas City, Mo., then split Games 2 and 3 at the Barons\u2019 home park in Birmingham.\n\nThe Redskins were hosting the New York Giants again at Griffith Stadium, so the Grays and Barons stayed on the road, this time meeting in New Orleans. But the Grays didn\u2019t need home-field advantage. They mopped up the Barons, 14-1, then returned to Birmingham for the decisive Game 5, a 10-6 Grays win that took 10 innings. Homestead scored four runs in the 10th to break open a 6-6 tie.\n\nAD\n\nThe District hasn\u2019t hosted a World Series game since 1945, when the Cleveland Buckeyes defeated the Grays in Game 3 at Griffith Stadium, 4-0. The city hasn\u2019t hosted a World Series victory since 1944\u2032s decisive Game 5: Homestead Grays 4, Birmingham Black Barons 2.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Washington\u2019s MLB legacy is average at best \u2014 the three franchises to play in the District have a combined .465 winning percentage \u2014 the city\u2019s baseball fans can turn to the Grays\u2019 legacy: three World Series titles and 12 inductees to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, including Leonard, Josh Gibson (known in baseball lore as the \u201cBlack Babe Ruth\u201d) and James \u201cCool Papa\u201d Bell.\n\nAnd while mostly white crowds endured the jeer, \u201cFirst in war, first in peace, last in the American League\u201d as the first iteration of the Senators posted 41 losing seasons in the 60 years before the team moved to Minnesota, mostly black crowds rooted on a consistent winner at Griffith Stadium.\n\nAD\n\nThe Grays played a fast style of baseball: lots of balls in play and lots of stolen bases. Gibson batting from the right side of the plate and Leonard from the left side made for the \u201cmost feared batting twosome in Negro Baseball,\u201d as Leonard\u2019s Hall of Fame plaque reads.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe played a different kind of baseball than the white teams,\u201d Bell told biographer Shaun McCormack in the book \u201cCool Papa Bell.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe played tricky baseball. We did things they didn\u2019t expect. We\u2019d bunt and run in the first inning. Then when they would come in for a bunt, we\u2019d hit away. We always crossed them up.\u201d\n\nBy 1940, the Grays adopted Washington as their \u201chome away from home\u201d and in subsequent years played more games in the District than at Pittsburgh\u2019s Forbes Field. In the mid-1940s, with the Senators mostly middling, the Grays were in their prime: They won 76 percent of their games in 1943 and boasted a roster with five Hall of Famers. They batted .330 as a team with a .458 slugging percentage, according to the database at Seamheads.com, both tops in the Negro National League.\n\nAD\n\nAnd games at Griffith Stadium were a tremendous draw for Washington\u2019s African American fans. Griffith Stadium was practically in the heart of the black community and next to the campus of Howard University. Surrounding the ballpark was one of the city\u2019s middle class and upper middle class black neighborhoods, home to government workers, local business owners and university professors, said Brad Snyder, a law professor at Georgetown University and author of \u201cBeyond the Shadow of the Senators,\u201d a history of the Grays and Negro baseball.\n\n\u201cIt was D.C.\u2019s black social scene,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cand the ballpark is the middle of that social scene.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Homestead Grays were looked at as a spectacular team,\u201d said Ted Knorr, founder of the Society for American Baseball Research\u2019s semiannual Negro League Research Conference. \u201cThis was the team, with Gibson and Leonard and their two personalities, in the Negro National League.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Grays\u2019 crowds were exceptional, too. Tight government controls on gasoline during World War II made getting out of the city almost impossible, Snyder said, so local residents flocked to the ballpark for summer diversions. Washington was a stop on major railways, while Pittsburgh was further west. There was no point, Snyder said, for the team to go back to Forbes Field.\n\nBut by 1948, things had changed. Homestead started four players at least 35 years-old; the lineup\u2019s average age was 31. The Barons started seven players 30 or younger. And that series also marked the final days of the Negro Leagues. Jackie Robinson had joined the Montreal Royals, the Brooklyn Dodgers\u2019 minor league team, in 1946. He broke the major league color barrier in 1947.\n\nAD\n\nBy 1948, seven black players were in the major leagues and more were in the minors. Alongside accounts of the Negro World Series games, black newspapers published stats for Robinson, Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella and Cleveland Indians outfielder Larry Doby with equal fervor.\n\nAD\n\nThe Negro National League shut down after the 1948 World Series. The Negro American League continued on an informal basis into the 1960s, but its final season as a major league, one comparable in talent to major league baseball, probably was the year of Washington\u2019s last championship.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "While Washington\u2019s MLB legacy is average at best, the city\u2019s baseball history is bolstered by the Grays\u2019 legacy.", "authors": ["Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jrV-o2pMBCI_zzPY6Z_qGRqfed0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/24EYWWYMMFGP5PBSI2V6PSFARA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
