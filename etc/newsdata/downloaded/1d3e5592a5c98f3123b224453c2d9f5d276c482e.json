I just kind of fell by her, not really thinking anything else,' he said.\n\nHe emerged to find his wife lying on the ground outside next to their dog, which had also been shot.\n\nABC reports that he told them she often ran with her dog because she did not feel safe doing so alone and that she slept with a weapon under pillow.\n\n'She really loved justice... there was another side that would be taking it personal.

Falan, said the island's 'spirit is broken' by the news of Bergeron's death.\n\n'Today marks a tragic day in our history. We are under the watchful eyes of the world. It is with great sadness that I report the death of Yap's acting attorney general, Rachelle Bergeron,' Falan said.\n\n'On behalf of all the citizens of Yap, both here and abroad, I offer our united heartfelt condolences to her husband, her family and friends, and colleagues. Her loss will be greatly felt by all who knew her.\n\n'Yap's spirit is broken by this senseless and heinous act.'\n\nBergeron was from Wisconsin and first moved to Yap in 2015 to take a job as assistant attorney general. She had previously worked in Washington, New York and India.\n\nShe and Hammerling were just days away from celebrating their first wedding anniversary when she was killed.\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia, located about three-quarters of the way from Hawaii to Indonesia, has close ties with the U.S. under a compact of free association, and the U.S. dollar is its primary currency.\n\nAccording to a US Department of State 2019 Crime and Safety report, serious or violent crimes in Micronesia are incredibly rare, however there are regular reports of petty crimes against travelers.\n\nCollins said Bergeron's husband called him a few minutes after the shooting at 7:15 pm and he arrived about the same time as the police.\n\nBergeron had been shot in her upper leg and her upper chest and was unconscious, Collins said. He and a nurse used a blanket to move Bergeron onto his flatbed truck and they drove to the hospital.\n\nCollins said that he doesn't know who shot Bergeron but that some of those she had prosecuted might hold grudges. He said he considers Yap a safe place and doesn't lock his car or worry when walking at night.\n\nHe said Bergeron had a passion for fighting for justice for those who had been abused, especially women and children. Her husband is a pilot with Pacific Mission Aviation, a Christian missionary organization in the region where Collins also works.\n\nAnother friend, Julie Hartup, who lives in nearby Guam, said the couple were hoping to start a family soon.\n\nShe said she had joined the couple and their families in July for a celebration of their marriage, when they retook their vows. She said Bergeron's father gave a speech about how his daughter had always wanted to be a voice for the voiceless, and to give strength to those who didn't have it.\n\n'Her family came out for a couple of weeks, and she was showing them the island, how pretty it was,' Hartup said. 'It was quite joyous for everyone.'\n\nBut she said Bergeron was feeling the strain of her new role, which she had taken on in January, and was eager to return home.\n\nHartup said it was hard to believe what had happened to her friend.\n\n'She had a fun laugh; she loved her dogs; she loved going running; she really cared about the community,' Hartup said. 'She was trying her hardest to do the best job she could, and ultimately somebody took her life for being so good at her job.'\n\nA GoFundMe has been set up by Bergeron's family to help with funeral costs.\n\n'We grieve with Simon in his terrible loss and pray that he will have strength through the loss of his best friend and the person that had brought him so much joy and true happiness,' organizer of the fund, Joe Adams, wrote.", "description": "Rachelle Bergeron, 33, was shot three times on Monday as she returned home from a jog with one her dogs on the tiny Micronesian island where she lived with her husband.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith", "Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/18/19846648-0-image-a-24_1571332078664.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
