There\u2019s even an entire state backing the apple launch.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t about iPhones.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s an actual apple, grown in an orchard. Growers insist, however, that the Cosmic Crisp is no ordinary apple, and is worthy of the hype.\n\n\"It's a really good apple,\" said Kate Evans, the British director of the Washington State University\u2019s Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center \u2013 one of only three publicly-funded apple breeding programmes in the US.\n\nThe other two centres, she told The Telegraph, are at the University of Minnesota and Cornell University, in upstate New York.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ultra-crisp apple, it\u2019s relatively firm, it has a good balance of sweet and tart and it\u2019s very juicy.\"", "description": "Launched in time for Christmas, the marketing blitz could not be more carefully choreographed.", "authors": ["Harriet Alexander", "Con Coughlin", "Julie Burchill", "Stephen Pollard", "Daniel Hannan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000213311459-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
