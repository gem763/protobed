Venkat\n\nShares of several Indian state-owned enterprises including a petroleum refiner and a shipping company surged on a report that the government is planning to sell its entire stakes in the firms.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd. (500547.BY), Shipping Corp. of India Ltd. (523598.BY) and Container Corp. of India Ltd. (531344.BY) added nearly 116.76 billion Indian rupees ($1.65 billion) in combined market capitalization within minutes of trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Tuesday.\n\nMedia reports citing Reuters said that a government panel has approved the sale of state stakes in the companies, which if successful, would be the biggest privatization by the government since 2000.\n\nA Ministry of Finance spokesperson didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe Indian government currently owns 53.29% stake in BPCL, 54.8% stake in Container Corp. and 63.75% in Shipping Corp.\n\nShares of Bharat Petroleum, which has a market capitalization of INR1.08 trillion, are up 5.8% in midmorning trade after hitting as high as 8.8%. Shipping Corp. which rose as much as 14% is up 6.4% and Container Corp. which hit a high of 6.5% within minutes of trading is 4.7% higher.\n\nContainer Corp has a market capitalization of INR380 billion, while Shipping Corp has a market capitalization of INR21.71 billion.\n\n\"This is likely to go to the cabinet for final approval. If approved, this would mark a significant shift in government's stance on disinvestment which has, thus far, been limited to either smaller stake sales in the open market or inter-state owned enterprises transactions,\" Citigroup said in a note.\n\nWrite to P.R.
