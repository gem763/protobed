The shutdown, which would affect 36 counties, would be the largest wind-related blackout in California to date, according to The Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cPG&E will need to turn off power for safety several hours before the potentially damaging winds arrive,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWinds of this magnitude pose a higher risk of damage and sparks on the electric system and rapid wildfire spread. The fire risk is even higher because vegetation on the ground has been dried out by recent wind events.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPG&E urged customers to prepare for a shutoff lasting 48 hours or longer, noting that \u201cpower cannot be restored until the dangerous weather has passed, safety inspections of de-energized lines are complete, and damage to the system has been repaired.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe understand that a longer shutoff would be very difficult for our customers,\" PG&E Corporation CEO and President Bill Johnson William (Bill) Leslie JohnsonLargest California utility reports broken power line near wildfire origin Rolling blackouts sweep through Northern California, could hit southern part of state Republicans storm closed-door hearing to protest impeachment inquiry MORE said in a statement. \"We are already working to minimize the length, including amassing a force of field personnel from PG&E, plus contractors and other utility companies, to be ready to tackle the inspection, repair and restoration process as soon as the weather passes.\"\n\nStrong winds have already wreaked havoc in California, helping fuel a 21,900-acre wildfire in Sonoma County. The cause of the fire is still unknown, but some suspect that PG&E transmission lines are to blame.\n\nThe company has been shutting off power to customers to avoid fires sparked by electrical lines.
