Photo: FX\n\nRyan Murphy\u2019s American Horror Story returns this week with its ninth installment, subtitled \u201c1984.\u201d What craziness does the man who turned Lady Gaga into an immortal and Jessica Lange into a witch have up his sleeve? How could the show keep topping itself? We don\u2019t know, except that we know it will.\n\nFrom its very first season, retroactively subtitled \u201cMurder House,\u201d American Horror Story has been earning headlines with its willingness to \u201cgo there\u201d in ways that other shows never even consider. Murphy\u2019s program has never quite gotten the credit it deserves in terms of craft and screenwriting, but it certainly gets a ton of attention on social media in the WTF department. Part of its success (maybe too big a part lately?) is dependent on shock value: What will AHS do to get people buzzing this week? It\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s still such a smash hit; you have to watch it live to know what everyone is talking about on your timeline, so you seek out the insanity every week.\n\nAfter eight seasons of chaos, it\u2019s a good time to look back at 12 moments that shocked American Horror Story viewers, picking out some of our favorites, by which we mean \u201cthings that still haunt us in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\n12. \u201cAsylum\u201d \u2014 Santa Is Coming to Town\n\nThe second installment of American Horror Story is widely considered the best, blending three-dimensional characters with a truly insane narrative involving mad scientists and a skin-wearing serial killer. The chaotic setting also allowed the writers to do something truly nuts by casting Ian McShane as a murderous version of Santa Claus. The star of Deadwood plays a psychopath who murders a charity Santa with a gun, taking his costume and heading out to commit a twisted home invasion, in which he ties up, threatens, and murders a family. Santa has been turned into a villain in horror movies before, but never with so much malevolent glee as McShane finds in this bit part.\n\n11. \u201cCult\u201d \u2013 Ally Kills Ivy\n\nA roller coaster of a season reaches its most unforgettable moment near the end in this riveting scene starring Sarah \u201cQueen of AHS\u201d Paulson and Alison Pill. Their characters, Ally and Ivy, first seem to have reconciled all their issues, but the conversation gets heated and ugly as the scene goes along. But what first looks like another domestic squabble in a season that had a few too many of those becomes much darker when Ivy coughs up blood. Ally has murdered her as vengeance for all the shit Ivy put her through all season. It may not have the bonkers imagery of rubber men or twisted clowns, but it\u2019s a shocking scene nonetheless.\n\n10. \u201cHotel\u201d \u2013 Lady Gaga Goes Hunting\n\nMurphy & Co. have a habit of introducing new characters in splashy, fascinating ways, but their best to date may still be in the premiere of \u201cHotel.\u201d Well into the first episode, we finally meet the Countess (Lady Gaga) and Donovan (Matt Bomer) as they\u2019re preparing to go hunting, finding a couple to swing with, and then murder, basically covering their naked bodies in the couple\u2019s blood. It\u2019s all brilliantly set to the great \u201cTear You Apart\u201d by She Wants Revenge, a song so perfectly used that it sounds written for the scene. Quite a way to welcome people to \u201cHotel.\u201d\n\n9. \u201cFreak Show\u201d \u2013 Everybody Loves a Clown\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pick one WTF moment related to John Carroll Lynch\u2019s clown named Twisty, a TV creation that\u2019s so unsettling that he could scare even Pennywise. A solid case could be made for his origin story later in the season, in which we learn about how he tried to kill himself with a shotgun but only mutilated everything below his upper lip. But we\u2019ll never forget the first sighting, when he attacks a young couple on a picnic, slicing up the man and kidnapping the woman. Twisty is one of the most, well, twisted creations in AHS history, and this scene is much of the reason why.\n\n8. \u201cMurder House\u201d \u2013 The Rubber Man Can\n\nIt all started here. It was a gentler, less daring time on TV when American Horror Story premiered on October 5, 2011, and viewers were instantly captivated by the weirdest show basic cable had ever produced \u2014 even if it is funny to consider how tame this season looks now compared to what Murphy & Co. had up their bloody sleeves for the seasons to come. In the series premiere, Connie Britton\u2019s Vivien Harmon is startled to see a man in a rubber suit, thinking it\u2019s her husband Ben. It was most definitely not, and the shock of it set the template for all the American Horror Story installments to come.\n\n7. \u201cFreak Show\u201d \u2013 Elsa\u2019s Background\n\nThere are no clips of this that can be posted online for a reason \u2014 it\u2019s hard to believe it was even on television. Elsa, the David Bowie\u2013singing ringmaster played by Jessica Lange, has one of the darkest backgrounds in the history of AHS, as we see in a flashback clip in episode four. It turns out that not only was Elsa a dominatrix in the past, but she lost her legs as a part of a torture-porn video in which they were amputated during a twisted, depraved film shoot. It\u2019s a moment that\u2019s hard to forget in the history of AHS, and actually was kind of a gross-out turning point for a lot of viewers \u2014 a scene that might\u2019ve gone too far.\n\n6. \u201cCoven\u201d \u2013 Minotaur Sex\n\nThe list of Oscar-nominated actresses who have had sex with a minotaur onscreen is comprised of exactly one: Gabourey Sidibe. You could pick an entire dozen WTF scenes from \u201cCoven,\u201d but the most unforgettable moment has to be when a mythical creature summoned by Marie Laveau encounters Sidibe\u2019s Queenie, and, well, things get kinky. Honestly, this is one of those you-can\u2019t-do-that-on-television moments in AHS history that feels a bit more designed for shock value than anything else (although that could really be said about almost all of \u201cCoven,\u201d a season that starts at 11 and never turns down the volume.)\n\n5. \u201cAsylum\u201d \u2013 Shelley Becomes a Rasper\n\nThis might be the creepiest thing in the history of television. A child on a playground finds what remains of Shelly (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny), the nymphomaniac who has been turned into a hideous creature known as a Rasper by the malevolent Dr. Arden (James Cromwell). Her first appearance, found by \u201cAnne Frank\u201d earlier in the season, is perhaps the most truly shocking, but something about putting this creature in a playground setting makes this scene more unforgettable. It\u2019s in that child\u2019s scream.\n\n4. \u201cHotel\u201d \u2013 Addiction Demon Gets His Fix\n\nBefore the season premiered, Ryan Murphy built excitement by claiming that they had filmed \u201cthe most disturbing scene we\u2019ve ever done\u201d for the season premiere. Anyone who saw \u201cAsylum\u201d and \u201cCoven\u201d immediately sat up in their chair, wondering how that was even possible. It turned out he was referring to a sequence from the premiere, in which an addict played by Max Greenfield visits the hotel and encounters what would become known as the Addiction Demon: a hideous riff on season one\u2019s rubber man, faceless but with a sharp, violent dildo, which he then uses to rape his prey.\n\n3. \u201cRoanoke\u201d \u2013 Going Viral\n\nWidely considered the worst season of AHS simply because it was so wildly inconsistent \u2014 it often felt like they made it up as they went along \u2014 \u201cRoanoke\u201d still contains one of the most legitimately terrifying sequences in the history of the show. Taissa Farmiga\u2019s Sophie Green is a fan of the \u201cMy Roanoke Nightmare\u201d show-within-a-show and mounts Go Pros to her friends and herself to go investigate herself. The result is that we get to see her death from a first-person POV, including the image of someone looking down to see they are being set ablaze. It\u2019s nightmare fuel.\n\n2. \u201cMurder House\u201d \u2013 I See Dead People\n\nOne of the first truly shocking moments in AHS history is also one of its most heartbreaking as Taissa Farmiga\u2019s Violet discovers the very hard way that she has something in common with Bruce Willis from The Sixth Sense. There\u2019s a reason she hasn\u2019t been able to leave the house \u2026 it\u2019s because she\u2019s dead, and the serial killer Tate proves it to her by taking her to the basement and revealing her own rotting body. Harsh and unforgettable.\n\n1. \u201cAsylum\u201d \u2013 The Basement\n\n\u201cAsylum\u201d peaks with the revelation that Zachary Quinto\u2019s Dr. Thredson is actually the vicious, Leatherface-esque serial killer who has been lurking throughout the entire season, something we learn along with poor Sarah Paulson\u2019s Lana, who has been kidnapped and locked in his basement. It\u2019s bad enough that Thredson forced gay aversion therapy on her, but now he\u2019s killed her girlfriend and is using her teeth as a part of his mask. It gets worse when it\u2019s revealed that Thredson has been having sex with Wendy\u2019s corpse, and then proceeds to rape Lana. Excuse us. We need to go take a shower just after writing that sentence.", "description": "From its very first season, Ryan Murphy\u2019s FX series American Horror Story has been earning headlines with its willingness to \u201cgo there\u201d in ways that other shows never even consider.", "authors": ["Brian Tallerico"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/17/17-twisty-the-clown-ahs.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
