He also called the local police.\n\nFBI special agent Christopher Combs told the Associated Press that Ator made \"rambling statements about some of the atrocities that he felt that he had gone through.\"\n\nCombs said Ator had just been fired from his job at Journey Oilfield Services.\n\n\"He was on a long spiral of going down,\" Combs said. \"He didn't wake up Saturday morning and walk into his company and then it happened. He went to that company in trouble.\"\n\nOdessa police chief Michael Gerke told reporters that both Ator and his employer called police before the shooting.\n\nRead more: Photos show thousands of people gathered in Odessa, Texas for an emotional tribute to the victims of Saturday's mass shooting\n\n\"Basically they were complaining at each other because they had a disagreement over that firing,\" he said, according to NBC News.\n\nBy the time police arrived at Journey Oilfield Services' offices, Ator had already left.\n\nUnaware of Ator's calls to the FBI and police, a Texas state trooper tried to pull Ator over for failing to use a turn signal during a lane change.\n\nAt that point, Ator pointed an AR-style rifle at the trooper, fired at his vehicle, launching a police chase in which he fired at random. The chase ended when police killed Ator.\n\nOdessa officials said on Monday that the victims in the shooting were between 17 months old and 57 years old. Victims include mail carrier Mary Granados, 29, and 15-year-old high school student Leilah Hernandez.", "description": "Police killed Seth Ator in Odessa, Texas, after he gunned down 7 people and injured around two dozen others on Saturday in a shooting that spanned 10 miles.", "authors": ["Kelly Mclaughlin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6ed2dbf4fc244075128e14-2732-1366.jpg"}
