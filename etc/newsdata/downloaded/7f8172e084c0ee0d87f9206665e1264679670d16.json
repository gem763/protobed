Our cars are getting five-star reviews around the world, and everybody likes to be part of a success story, so people are really proud of that\u2026 morale\u2019s very good and confidence is high.\u201d\n\nAnother Hit to Project Fear as Ferry Bosses Say Industry \u2018Sufficiently Prepared\u2019 for No Deal #Brexit https://t.co/4Aw9ig3Ewe \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 5, 2019\n\nFlewitt did suggest that McClaren were concerned about possible disruption to supply chains in the event of a clean, no-deal break with the EU \u2014 although he described the potential impact as \u201cshort-term\u201d \u2014 but stressed that the real issue was not so much no-deal trade terms in and of themselves but the fact that businesses are still in the dark about whether they are looking at a no-deal Brexit, a negotiated Brexit, or no Brexit at all with just days to go until the current October 31st deadline.\n\nSimilar comments have been made by Nigel Wonnacott of Brittany Ferries, who has been clear that No Deal does not present any serious issues and that even a single week would \u201cabsolutely\u201d be enough time to prepare for it \u2014 but the issue is that three years on from the 2016 vote for Brexit there is still no clarity as to whether or not the United Kingdom will even leave the EU, thanks in large part to the efforts of Remain-voting politicians who never accepted (or only pretended to accept) the result of the referendum and have been working to undermine or outright overturn it ever since.\n\nBiggest Poll Since EU Referendum Shows Big Public Majority for Honouring Brexit Vote https://t.co/eeExQyIDPW \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 18, 2019\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "The CEO of supercar maker McLaren has insisted Brexit will not stop it succeeding -- and it will stay in the UK where it was \"born and bred\".", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/mclaren-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
