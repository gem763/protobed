Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, told reporters.\n\nHe added, \"There was probably as much talk as anything about what will our lives be like through that trial.\"\n\nGraham reportedly pushed for Republicans to issue a signed statement describing Trump's July 25th call with the Ukrainian president, during which he asked Ukraine to \"do us a favor\" by investigating Joe Biden and his son, as \"unimpeachable.\" But other Republicans said the declaration could make Trump think that any GOP members who don't sign it are open to his removal.\n\nMcConnell has confirmed that a Senate trial would take place six days a week and he reportedly wants the trial to conclude before Christmas.
