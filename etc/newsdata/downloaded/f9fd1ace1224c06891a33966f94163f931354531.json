Bush, pointed out to 2016 presidential embarrassment Evan McMullin that under his reading of the law, Barack Obama should\u2019ve been impeached when he was caught on a hot mic telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he\u2019d have \u201cmore flexibility\u201d after the 2012 election.\n\nFleischer\u2019s back-and-forth with the Egg McMuffin started with this tweet where he questions if Trump\u2019s comments is impeachable in the first place:\n\nThis Army officer working at the NSC was right. The POTUS mention of the Bidens was inappropriate. The question now is: was it a crime? Was it an impeachable offense? That\u2019s the only issue that matters. https://t.co/hBz2m8a72s \u2014 Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) October 29, 2019\n\nEnter the Never-Trump conservative from Utah:\n\nAccording to 52 USC 30121, it\u2019s illegal to solicit the contribution of a thing of value from a foreigner in connection with a federal election. As you know, campaigns pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for opposition research and communications related services. It was a crime. https://t.co/9pUWmuARxx \u2014 Evan McMullin (@EvanMcMullin) October 29, 2019\n\nAnd not just any crime, but an attempt by Trump to cripple the American people\u2019s ability to vote him out of office by again enlisting the help of a disinformation campaign by a foreign power. This is a direct, illegal attack on our elections and freedom. It MUST be impeachable. \u2014 Evan McMullin (@EvanMcMullin) October 29, 2019\n\nAnd, BOOM:\n\nThen you need to impeach Obama, who sought help in his re-election when he asked Russian Pres Medvedev for \u201cspace\u201d until Election Day, after which he would have \u201cmore flexibility\u201d on missile defense. O sought to help himself. Trump sought to weaken an opponent. Same core issue. \u2014 Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) October 29, 2019\n\n***", "description": "Boom.", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Am On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/obama_flint_ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
