The question is: what names are likely to come out on top when the streaming wars are all set and done (20:20-23:50).\n\nTo close out the episode, each analyst provides their stock of the week: KB Home (NYSE: ) for Jesse (23:50-25:30) and Nike (NYSE: ) for Clement (25:30-27:00).\n\nFind us on Twitter for feedback @Investingcom, @BellRingersPod, @JesseCohenInv, and @ClemThibault!\n\nDisclaimer: At the time of writing, neither Jesse nor Clement own shares in any of the companies mentioned.
