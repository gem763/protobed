Nevertheless, about a quarter (24 percent) of voters who identify as Democrats or tilt towards the party are against impeaching and removing Trump.\n\nThe poll also found that the number of registered voters who are against Congress holding impeachment hearings on Trump exceeds those who are in favor, noting, \u201c[Forty-six] percent think that there is enough cause now for Congress to hold hearings on the impeachment of President Donald Trump, while 49 percent say there is not enough cause, and 5 percent say they do not know.\u201d\n\nThe number of registered voters who stand against holding impeachment hearings has decreased from 59 percent in January to 49 percent now.\n\n\u201cIn April 2019, 29 percent said there was sufficient reason for impeachment hearings, and 65 percent said there was not,\u201d the Marquette Law School pointed out, adding, \u201cIn January 2019, 33 percent supported and 59 percent opposed hearings.\u201d\n\nAgain, a majority of independent voters (53 percent) agreed with voters who identify as Republicans (86 percent) or lean towards that party (77 percent) that there is not enough cause for Congress to be conducting impeachment hearings on Trump.\n\nSo far, House Democrats pursuing the impeachment inquiry have conducted all depositions behind closed doors, prompting vigorous criticism from Republicans.\n\nThe Marquette Law School poll lags behind national polls that found a majority of Americans support the impeachment and removal of Trump. Some national surveys on the Democrats\u2019 secret impeachment proceedings, however, have been discredited.\n\nThe law school poll \u201cis a reminder that the national poll results we\u2019re seeing are a bit different than in the attitudes in top battleground states for 2020,\u201d NBC News acknowledged.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Marquette Law School Poll noted that its recent survey \u201cis the most extensive statewide polling project in Wisconsin history.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis poll interviewed 799 registered Wisconsin voters by landline or cell phone, Oct. 13-17, 2019,\u201d it added. \u201cThe margin of error is +/-4.2 percentage points for the full sample.\u201d\n\nThe poll did find that among those Wisconsin voters who say they have read the transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, more than half believe there is enough reason to hold impeachment hearings.\n\n\u201cAmong those who have read the transcript, 51 percent think there is enough reason to hold impeachment hearings, compared to 42 percent among those who have not read the transcript\u201d the Marquette Law School pointed out. \u201cForty-six percent of those who have read the transcript think there is not enough reason to hold hearings, compared to 50 percent among those who have not read the transcript.\u201d\n\nTrump won Wisconsin in 2016. Echoing the results of a poll published in August, the new poll places Trump\u2019s overall job approval in Wisconsin at 46 percent.\n\nSlightly more than half (51 percent) of Wisconsin registered voters disapprove of Trump\u2019s performance, while two percent say they don\u2019t know.\n\nNearly half (48 percent) of Independent voters joined Republicans (91 percent) and those who lean towards that party (76 percent) in giving Trump a favorable job approval rating.", "description": "The majority of registered voters in battleground Wisconsin believe Congress should neither impeach nor remove President Trump from office.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/donald-trump-rally-louisiana-gov-race-101119-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
