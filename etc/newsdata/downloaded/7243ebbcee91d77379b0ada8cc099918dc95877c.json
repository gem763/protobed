The parliament has singled out financing of solid fossil fuels such as coal, saying this could not be called \u201csustainable\u201d in any way.\n\nThe Council and Commission want a more wide-ranging law, that would not have a specific list of green investments, leaving the door open for nuclear energy, for example, to be considered sustainable.\n\nBoth the Council and parliament hope the regulations and a general law can be established by the end of 2021 and come into force by the end of 2022.\n\nBut without a specific list of what is a green investment and what is not, lawmakers complain that the process could delay the law\u2019s implementation.\n\nAny delay on introducing eco-labels on financial investments could deter investors from buying green bonds and eco-friendly assets.\n\nBrussels proposed the law as part of a plan to make Europe the world\u2019s first climate neutral continent by 2050 but also to widen the market in green bonds and securities.\n\n\u201cSustainable finance is a great opportunity for the euro,\u201d Thierry Roland, head of global banking at HSBC Europe, told a conference in Brussels in September, as the market for green bonds is mostly denominated in euros, unlike many other assets which are priced in dollars.\n\nLast week, the EU launched new rules and standards for trillions of dollars of private and public \u201cgreen\u201d investment together with China, India and several other countries at an meeting of International Monetary Fund in Washington D.C.", "description": "European Union countries and lawmakers will start negotiations to set standards on sustainable investments on Wednesday, with a battle expected over whether oil, coal and nuclear fuel can count as \"green\"", "authors": ["Jonas Ekblom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
