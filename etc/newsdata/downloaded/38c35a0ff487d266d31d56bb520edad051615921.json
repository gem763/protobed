Among other things, he suggested that China be invited as a partner to the undertaking, as part of what he called the \u201cSpace Exploration Alliance.\u201d\n\nThe very next day, in a speech before this year\u2019s International Astronautical Conference, Vice President Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceHow Turkey sees its Syria invasion GOP lawmaker: Trump administration 'playing checkers' in Syria while others are 'playing chess' Clinton trolls Trump with mock letter from JFK to Khrushchev MORE seemed to disagree. According to Space.com, Pence presented a vision of an international space exploration effort that was wide of the one Aldrin proposed.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, our vision is to be a leader amongst freedom-loving nations on the adventure into the great unknown,\" he said. \"The United States of America will always be willing to work closely with like-minded, freedom-loving nations as we lead mankind into the final frontier.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe qualifiers \u201clike-minded\u201d and \u201cfreedom-loving\u201d would rule out a number of potential partners, but especially China. China is many things, but it certainly does not consider its interests aligned with the United States and does not love freedom, not even a little.\n\nChina also does not respect property rights, another aspect of exploring space that Pence mentioned. \u201cAs more nations gain the ability to explore space and develop places beyond Earth\u2019s atmosphere, we must also ensure that we carry into space our shared commitment to freedom, the rule of law, and private property,\u201d he said, according to Geek Wire,\n\nChina\u2019s war against freedom has been well documented in the media. The Beijing government has been herding China\u2019s Muslim Uighurs into reeducation camps to break their separate ethnic identity. China is also developing a so-called social credit system that will gather information on its citizens using the internet and surveillance cameras. Then the Chinese government will reward or punish its people based on how closely they adhere to officially approved behavior.\n\nThe people of Hong Kong have risen against these and other restrictions in almost daily demonstrations, many of which have turned violent. The police have reacted with extreme savagery. But the demonstrators have thus far been undaunted. So far, China has not loosed the People\u2019s Liberation Army on Hong Kong, as it did 30 years ago at Tiananmen Square.\n\nChina\u2019s abhorrence of freedom has extended to people and organizations that are not under its sovereign authority but who do want to do business with it. Chinese censors ensure that Hollywood movies and TV shows do not depict China in an unfavorable light. The controversy that occurred when the general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team tweeted support for the Hong Kong demonstrators is another example. The controversy has severely affected the National Basketball Association and has shown the lengths that Beijing will go to control expressed opinion in the West.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPence\u2019s implication is clear. A country must love freedom, the rule of law and property rights to be a suitable partner for America\u2019s new effort to explore the heavens. Such countries include Canada, Japan and Australia. Despite America\u2019s desire to go back to the moon and on to Mars, to paraphrase the line from Apollo, \u201cin peace with all humankind,\u201d China would be excluded.\n\nIs the United States, therefore, in a de facto space race with China? Very likely, though only as long as NASA and its partners are allowed to run it. Considering China\u2019s desire to dominate both the heavens and the Earth, a space race with an alliance of like-minded, freedom-loving nations and commercial companies would not be a bad thing.\n\nThe United States and its allies being in a space race with China speaks to one of the reasons NASA has been charged with getting astronauts back to the moon by 2024 and not by the previous date of 2028. The sooner that the American-led space alliance is on the moon, the more likely that America and her allies will be there to greet the Chinese if and when they arrive.\n\nThe longer that NASA\u2019s return to the moon is delayed, either by technical problems or by partisan politics, the more likely that the reverse will be true. Americans walked on the moon 50 years ago, so if China wins a moon race, it would be a punch to the gut. American space policy should be predicated on avoiding that possibility at all costs.\n\nMark R.
