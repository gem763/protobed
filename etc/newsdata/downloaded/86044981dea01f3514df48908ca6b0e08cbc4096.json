A few:\n\nIt appears these repeated conflicts over policy, along with Bolton's famed willingness to engage in ruthless bureaucratic maneuvering, ended the tenure of Trump's third national security adviser in three years.\n\nIt also set the stage for what could be the strangest and most risky political gambit of his administration so far: Direct talks between the US and Iranian presidents.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani and US President Donald Trump.

All the better if it can be contrasted with the 2015 nuclear deal struck by the Obama administration.\n\nBut Iran hardliners make up a substantial portion of Trump's political bedrock whom he would risk upsetting. This group includes those who are the staunch allies of Israel, Iran's biggest foe in the region.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-US National Security Advisor John Bolton deliver joint statements in Jerusalem in June 2019. safrir Abayov/Pool via REUTERS\n\nAny meeting that occurs without Bolton's hardline and deep experience with trying to have Iran bombed will likely worry these supporters deeply.\n\nIn Israel itself, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu f aces the most perilous election of his career next week. He has long flaunted his close relationship with Trump, and is one of the few US allies to unambiguously embrace the president.\n\nDirect talks with Iran by an American president desperate for a public win would deeply unsettle this key political and diplomatic base of Trump.\n\nThe White House still contains advisers, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who have long held hardline views on Iran. However, Pompeo has made it a signature of his tenure to avoid at all costs clashing with Trump, a contrast with his predecessor Rex Tillerson.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivers a statement in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, on Tuesday. Reuters\n\nNetanyahu's announcement that he would annex the Jordan River Valley, which is about a third of the occupied West Bank, came just as the Bolton's departure was announced.\n\nThat move, immediately lauded by many on the Israeli right, gives wavering supporters a potential consolation prize if Trump abandons a hard line on Iran.\n\nRead more: Meet John Bolton, an architect of the Iraq War who just got fired from his job as Trump's National Security Adviser\n\nIt's unclear, however, if this would be enough for Israel's most hardcore supporters in the US, who also provide Trump with his most stable political allies.\n\n(It is also far from certain that an Israeli annexation would work \u2014 the UN responded by saying that any annexation would have no standing in international law.)\n\nHow this base would respond to Trump attempting to renegotiate the nuclear treaty with the Iranians without Bolton and other like-minded hawks is far from certain.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that Trump has now cleared the way to try and deal with Iran, and other opponents like North Korea, completely on his own terms.", "description": "With John Bolton out, Trump could pursue a meeting with Iran's Hassan Rouhani.
