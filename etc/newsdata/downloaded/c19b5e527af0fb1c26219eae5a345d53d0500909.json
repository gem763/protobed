The cereal maker has teamed up with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) for their anti-bullying campaign, \"All Together,\" and they're doing just that \u2014 putting six cereals together in one box.\n\nThe new purple box features mascots from six Kellogg's brands \u2014 from Tony the Tiger to Toucan Sam \u2014 to help promote inclusion and togetherness.\n\nThe cereals won't actually be mixed in with each other. The box is a variety pack featuring mini boxes of Kellogg's favorites: Raisin Bran, Rice Krispies, Corn Flakes, Frosted Mini Wheats, Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops.\n\n\"We all belong together,\" Kellogg's writes on their website. \"So for the first time in history, our famous mascots and cereals are offered exclusively together in the same box for All Together Cereal. It's a symbol of acceptance no matter how you look, where you're from or who you love. We believe that all people deserve an environment where they can be their best selves.\"\n\nKellogg's first announced the \"All Together\" cereals for GLAAD's \"Spirit Day\" in 2018, according to The Advocate.\n\nThe limited-edition box was relaunched for 2019 Spirit Day, a day to promote anti-bullying by encouraging people to wear purple and support a more accepting world for LGBTQ youth, according to Kellogg. Kellogg will also donate $50,000 to GLAAD.\n\nGLAAD celebrated Spirit Day on October 17, with millions of people wearing purple to raise awareness. It is unclear how long the purple cereal boxes will be available.", "description": "Tony the Tiger, meet Toucan Sam", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/18/46561691-cb95-4beb-bb5c-ea4f82e9803b/thumbnail/1200x630/92537cd54b3ed4a9874676afedb0fea7/kellog-copy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
