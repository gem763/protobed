The fourth weekend of Warner Bros.\u2019 hit \u201cJoker\u201d and the second session of \u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil\u201d will probably be battling for the top spot at somewhere between $15 million and $20 million. \u201cJoker\u201d has shown impressive staying power with $256 million domestically in its first 20 days.\n\nThe second weekend of Sony\u2019s \u201cZombieland: Double Tap\u201d will likely wind up in third place in the $10 million to $15 million range. The horror-comedy sequel has topped $33 million in its first six days.\n\n\u201cBlack and Blue,\u201d released through Sony\u2019s Screen Gems, is projected to gross $6 million from 2,062 theaters during its first three days of release. Directed by Deon Taylor, \u201cBlack and Blue\u201d follows a rookie cop (Naomie Harris) who inadvertently captures the murder of a young drug dealer on her body cam. \u201cBlack and Blue\u201d cost $12 million to produce.\n\n\u201cCountdown\u201d will debut at 2,675 theaters amid expectations in the $5 million range. The PG-13 movie follows a nurse who downloads an app that predicts when a person is going to die and finds out she only has three days to live. It carries a $6.5 million price tag.\n\nAlso debuting this weekend is the long-delayed historical drama \u201cThe Current War,\u201d which looks to collect $3 million over the weekend at about 1,000 locations. The Weinstein Company was originally on board to distribute the movie following its premiere at the 2017 Toronto Film Festival, but it got shelved and sold after sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein were brought to light and the studio was shuttered.\n\n101 Studios, former Weinstein executive David Glasser\u2019s company, is handling the film, which stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Thomas Edison and Michael Shannon as George Westinghouse.\n\nSony is bringing back Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood,\u201d with 10 additional minutes of footage, to 1,674 locations starting on Friday. The movie has taken in nearly $140 million in North America since its release on July 26. It was playing in less than 100 venues last weekend. With the 10 additional minutes, the run time will be two hours and 51 minutes.\n\nLionsgate is expanding the reach of \u201cScary Stories to Tell in the Dark\u201d to 1,567 sites, adding more than 1,300 venues on the pre-Halloween weekend.\n\nOverall 2019 domestic box office has totaled $9.08 billion, down 5.4% as of Oct. 23, according to Comscore. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with Comscore, said the lag will persist.\n\n\u201cIn the continuing saga of a most tenacious year-to-date box-office deficit, a host of newcomers take on the daunting task of trying to somehow get the revenues going in a positive direction,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, it may not be in the cards with the year-ago second weekend performance of \u2018Halloween\u2019 exhibiting Michael Myers-type strength with a $31.4 million result, plus \u2018A Star Is Born\u2019 and \u2018Venom\u2019 bringing the heat as well.\u201d\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
