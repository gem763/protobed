Others reluctantly pulled the lever for Trump. Still others opposed his candidacy, adopted the label \u201cNever Trump,\u201d or even endorsed Hillary Clinton.\n\nYet more than two years later, we speak with one voice: There is no returning to the pre-Trump conservative consensus that collapsed in 2016. Any attempt to revive the failed conservative consensus that preceded Trump would be misguided and harmful to the right.\n\nWe give credit where it is due: Consensus conservatism played a heroic role in defeating Communism in the last century, by promoting prosperity at home and the expansion of a rules-based international order. At its best, the old consensus defended the natural rights of Americans and the \u201ctranscendent dignity of the human person, as the visible image of the invisible God\u201d (Pope John Paul II, Centesimus Annus) against the depredations of totalitarian regimes.\n\nBut even during the Cold War, this conservatism too often tracked the same lodestar liberalism did\u2014namely, individual autonomy. The fetishizing of autonomy paradoxically yielded the very tyranny that consensus conservatives claim most to detest.\n\nAmerica\u2019s public philosophy now puts great stock in \u201cthe right to define one\u2019s own concept of . . . the mystery of human life,\u201d as Justice Anthony Kennedy, the libertarian conservative par excellence, wrote while upholding the constitutional \u201cright\u201d to abortion. But this vast leeway to discover the meaning of existence extends to destroying the freedom and lives of others (the unborn child\u2019s, in the case of abortion).\n\nYes, the old conservative consensus paid lip service to traditional values. But it failed to retard, much less reverse, the eclipse of permanent truths, family stability, communal solidarity, and much else. It surrendered to the pornographization of daily life, to the culture of death, to the cult of competitiveness. It too often bowed to a poisonous and censorious multiculturalism.\n\nFaced with voters\u2019 resounding \u201cNo!\u201d to these centrifugal forces, consensus conservatives have grown only more rigid in their certainties. They have elevated prudential judgments and policies into sacred dogmas. These dogmas\u2014free trade on every front, free movement through every boundary, small government as an end in itself, technological advancement as a cure-all\u2014foreclose debate about the nature and purpose of our common life.\n\nConsensus conservatism long ago ceased to inquire into the first things. But we will not.\n\nWe oppose the soulless society of individual affluence.\n\nOur society must not prioritize the needs of the childless, the healthy, and the intellectually competitive. Our policy must accommodate the messy demands of authentic human attachments: family, faith, and the political community. We welcome allies who oppose dehumanizing attempts at \u201cliberation\u201d such as pornography, \u201cdesigner babies,\u201d wombs for rent, and the severing of the link between sex and gender.\n\nWe stand with the American citizen.\n\nIn recent years, some have argued for immigration by saying that working-class Americans are less hard-working, less fertile, in some sense less worthy than potential immigrants. We oppose attempts to displace American citizens. Advancing the common good requires standing with, rather than abandoning, our countrymen. They are our fellow citizens, not interchangeable economic units. And as Americans we owe each other a distinct allegiance and must put each other first.\n\nWe reject attempts to compromise on human dignity.\n\nIn 2013, the Republican National Committee released an \u201cautopsy report\u201d that proposed compromising on social issues in order to appeal to young voters. In fact, millennials are the most pro-life generation in America, while economic libertarianism isn\u2019t nearly as popular as its Beltway proponents imagine. We affirm the nonnegotiable dignity of every unborn life and oppose the transhumanist project of radical self-identification.\n\nWe resist a tyrannical liberalism.\n\nWe seek to revive the virtues of liberality and neighborliness that many people describe as \u201cliberalism.\u201d But we oppose any attempt to conflate American interests with liberal ideology. When an ideological liberalism seeks to dictate our foreign policy and dominate our religious and charitable institutions, tyranny is the result, at home and abroad.\n\nWe want a country that works for workers.\n\nThe Republican Party has for too long held investors and \u201cjob creators\u201d above workers and citizens, dismissing vast swaths of Americans as takers unworthy of its time. Trump\u2019s victory, driven in part by his appeal to working-class voters, shows the potential of a political movement that heeds the cries of the working class as much as the demands of capital. Americans take more pride in their identity as workers than their identity as consumers. Economic and welfare policy should prioritize work over consumption.\n\nWe believe home matters.\n\nFor those who enjoy the upsides, a borderless world brings intoxicating new liberties. They can go anywhere, work anywhere. They can call themselves \u201ccitizens\u201d of the world. But the jet-setters\u2019 vision clashes with the human need for a common life. And it has bred resentments that are only beginning to surface. We embrace the new nationalism insofar as it stands against the utopian ideal of a borderless world that, in practice, leads to universal tyranny.\n\nWhatever else might be said about it, the Trump phenomenon has opened up space in which to pose these questions anew. We will guard that space jealously. And we respectfully decline to join with those who would resurrect warmed-over Reaganism and foreclose honest debate.\n\nSohrab Ahmari\n\nNew York Post\n\nJeffrey Blehar\n\n\n\nPatrick Deneen\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame\n\nRod Dreher\n\nThe American Conservative\n\nPascal-Emmanuel Gobry\n\nEthics and Public Policy Center\n\nDarel Paul\n\nWilliams College\n\nC.
