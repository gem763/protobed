It\u2019s almost like they built this facility to host this event,\u201d he said.\n\nIt appears that only Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, the Republican mayor of Miami-Dade county, received any kind of heads-up, and that a quick phone call from the White House office of intergovernmental affairs barely 45 minutes before Mulvaney took the podium, according to an assistant.\n\nClimate crisis will not be discussed at G7 next year, says Trump official Read more\n\n\u201cI did not know it was going to be announced,\u201d said Juan Carlos Bermudez, the mayor of the city of Doral.\n\n\u201cWe had a conversation with the White House in late June, a very brief one, on the possibility of this coming to Doral but I did not receive a phone call before the announcement. I found out just like you found out.\u201d That is, via the live televised briefing.\n\nSimilarly, the Miami-Dade police department, the largest law enforcement agency in the south-eastern US, had also been out of the loop.\n\n\u201cNada. Zilch,\u201d the spokesperson Alvaro Zabaleta told the Miami Herald when the newspaper asked what advance notice had been received.\n\nZabaleta\u2019s colleague, detective Angel Rodriguez, admitted to the Guardian on Friday: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a whole lot of information right now. As the weeks go by, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be getting more.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile William Talbert, the head of the Greater Miami convention and visitors bureau that will play a lead role in accommodating tens of thousands of fans for next year\u2019s American football Super Bowl, was another who found out from television news.\n\nHe told the Herald he had not checked to see what other events might be on in Miami at the same time as the G7, at the Trump National resort in Doral, from 10 to 12 June, 2020.\n\nThe suddenness of the announcement raised concerns over security, with some experts doubting the authenticity of the selection process the White House said it followed to find a venue, or whether the 800-acre, 643-room facility had received an appropriate federal security vetting. The Secret Service, which would be responsible for such a review, did not return an inquiry from the Guardian.\n\nThe decision to host the event at his own resort has also led to accusations that Trump will profit personally, an allegation Mulvaney denied. In May it was revealed that Trump\u2019s profits from Doral had plummeted, while this summer the president was forced to deny reports that the resort was infested by bed bugs.\n\nBermudez, the Doral mayor, said his city would now be working closely with the Secret Service and White House to prepare for the event, and had already switched more than $300,000 in city funds to pay for police overtime and equipment and other resources he said would be needed.\n\nHe also said he hoped Trump would rethink a decision to keep any discussion of the climate crisis off the G7 agenda.\n\n\u201cWhen you have an opportunity for a summit of this type, there\u2019s a valid argument to discuss all the issues that impact not only us but the six other countries and the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cClimate change is an important issue to us in south Florida and Doral. I hope that democracy in the Americas and issues like climate change that the seven countries can discuss will be discussed.\u201d", "description": "Announcement came as a surprise to city and police that will host and protect world leaders at US taxpayers\u2019 expense", "authors": ["Richard Luscombe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67cf1eb10e89270291cca9d048dcf63996d2d172/122_643_5143_3087/master/5143.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f05d9fc0bcc3e70f23b411640b5fd89e", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
