Disappointment among rank and file at the failure to prevent the plant shutdowns and block GM from moving work to Mexico could be challenges for union leaders as they seek to have the deal ratified.\n\nIn 2015, rank and file UAW workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV <FCHA.MI> rejected the first version of a contract. This time, UAW leaders are keeping workers on strike pay of $275 (213.9 pounds) a week while they decide on the tentative agreement.\n\n\"Our members will make this decision,\" UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said at a press conference at the Detroit building where GM is based. \"It is their contract. It is in their hands.\u201d\n\nGM hopes the deal can be approved expeditiously. \"We encourage the UAW to move as quickly as possible through the ratification process, so we can resume operations and get back to producing vehicles for our customers,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nGM shares closed down 1.3% at $36.19 on Thursday, after a modest rally on Wednesday following the UAW's announcement it had reached a tentative contract deal.\n\nOn Wall Street, reaction to the proposed agreement, the highlights of which the union released, has been muted. \"We continue to believe that if this is ratified, it is a fairly solid outcome for GM,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note Thursday. \"The financial implications of the deal don\u2019t look too onerous.\"\n\nThe strike began on Sept. 16, with UAW negotiators seeking higher pay for workers, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues included the fate of plants GM has indicated it may close, the use of lower-paid temporary workers and GM's production of vehicles in Mexico.\n\nThe strike cost GM an estimated $2 billion according to analysts, hurt auto suppliers and played a role in U.S. manufacturing output falling more than expected in September.\n\nThe longest nationwide strike against a Detroit automaker since 1970 became a political event. Democratic presidential candidates joined UAW picket lines, eager to win union votes in Midwest swing states. For his part, U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on GM Chief Executive Mary Barra before the strike to preserve jobs at a car plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that she had targeted for closure.\n\nHowever, under the deal, GM will move ahead with closing Lordstown and two parts plants in Baltimore and Warren, Michigan. Workers from Lordstown on Thursday were outside GM's Detroit headquarters, where UAW leaders were meeting, to protest the planned agreement.\n\nGM also appears to have dodged a significant addition to its long-term balance sheet liabilities by agreeing to make a one-time cash distribution to UAW members eligible for pensions.\n\nThe union said GM has agreed to put \"new product\" in the company's Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant as part of the deal. Details were not provided in the UAW summary but sources have said the plant will build electric trucks.\n\nSeparate from the UAW deal, GM on Thursday confirmed plans for an electric battery plant near the Lordstown complex that could eventually employ 1,000 people. Sources have said the battery plant would be a joint venture, where the workers are represented by the UAW and earn in the range of $15 to $17 an hour.\n\nThe Trump administration praised GM's push to create jobs in Ohio.\n\n\"The White House is strongly committed to a vibrant and sustainable manufacturing future for Lordstown, one that involves the maximum use of that footprint,\" Peter Navarro, a White House trade and manufacturing policy adviser, told Reuters.\n\n\n\n\n\nLORDSTOWN'S DISPLACED WORKERS\n\nGM has said it plans to sell the Lordstown plant to a group affiliated with electric truck startup Workhorse Group Inc <WKHS.O> that would initially employ 400 people - barely a tenth of the workforce Lordstown had when it was operating on three shifts. A Workhorse spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nStory continues", "description": "DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Thursday workers at General Motors Co  will stay off the job while they vote on a proposed contract that delivers higher pay for full-time workers and better terms for temporary workers, but allows the automaker to close three U.S.", "authors": ["Paul Lienert", "David Shepardson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uKadxzvh.zeKzfsIazI22g--~B/aD0zMDM7dz00NDk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/reuters.com/ce016b9dc0c94e29a13a5a74bc0fb499", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
