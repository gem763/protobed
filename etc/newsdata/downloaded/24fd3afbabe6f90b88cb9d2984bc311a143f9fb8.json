If the government mentioned [a withdrawal] in June it would have stopped already,\" he told reporters, referring to the protests.\n\nHong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index jumped after the report, trading up about 3.3 per cent. The property index also jumped six per cent.\n\nThe withdrawal of the draft legislation was one of the protesters' key demands. Lam has said before that the bill was \"dead\" but she did not withdraw it.\n\nHong Kong returned to China under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that allows it to keep freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, like the freedom to protest and an independent legal system, hence the anger at the extradition bill and perceived creeping influence by Beijing.\n\n'Unforgivable havoc'\n\nLam told business leaders last week that she had caused \"unforgivable havoc\" by introducing the bill and that if she had a choice she would apologize and resign, according to a leaked audio recording.\n\nAt the closed-door meeting, Lam told the group that she now has \"very limited\" room to resolve the crisis because the unrest has become a national security and sovereignty issue for China amid rising tensions with the United States.\n\nIn leaked audio recordings obtained by Reuters, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam can be heard saying she has caused \"unforgivable havoc\" for introducing a controversial extradition bill. 0:32\n\nChina has denounced the protests and warned about the impact on Hong Kong's economy\n\nChina denies it is meddling in Hong Kong's affairs but warned again on Tuesday that it would not sit idly by if the unrest threatened Chinese security and sovereignty.\n\nRiot police fired beanbag guns and used pepper spray \u2014 both anti-riot weapons \u2014 on Tuesday to clear demonstrators from outside the Mong Kok police station and in Prince Edward metro station, with one man taken out on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face, television footage showed.\n\nVideos showing the man being apprehended by the police in the station have been widely shared on social media with protest groups and activists saying it is evidence of the police brutality they say is widespread and needs to be investigated.\n\nThis still image taken from a handout video obtained by Reuters shows police detaining a protester at a metro station in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong police are due to hold a news conference at 4 a.m. ET.\n\nThree men, aged between 21 and 42, were taken to Kwong Wa Hospital late on Tuesday, a hospital authority spokesperson said.\n\nTwo, including the man stretchered out of Prince Edward station, were in a stable condition and one had been discharged, she said.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam will announce on Wednesday the formal withdrawal of an extradition bill that triggered months of unrest and has thrown the Chinese-controlled territory into its worst crisis in decades, Hong Kong Cable Television and other media said.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5269558.1567580699!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1171845469.jpg"}
