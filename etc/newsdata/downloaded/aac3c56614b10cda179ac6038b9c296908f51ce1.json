And if someone has a sprained ankle, you're not going to push on him more. With us, once our brain gets to a point of spraining, people do everything to make it worse.\"\n\nAt a recent Sunday Service in Utah, West defended his decision to back Trump; last October, he delivered a lengthy soliloquy to a president who many deem racist, telling him he loved him to the dismay of many Democrats and fellow artists.\n\nOn Thursday, he offered another explanation: \"For the greatest artist in human existence to put a red hat on was God's practical joke to all liberals. Like, 'No! Not Kanye!'\"\n\nIn that wide-ranging interview aired with Apple Music, West also said a 10th, \"Sunday Service\" inspired album could drop on Christmas.\n\nREAD MORE: Kanye West claims he will one day be US president\n\nConsidering the shambolic Jesus Is King rollout, fans probably shouldn't plan a listening session under the tree just yet.\n\n\"The more I am in service to God, I just clear my head and just wake up more empty every day and let God do the driving and just use me as he may,\" West said in the interview.\n\n\"You make plans and God laughs.\"", "description": "Critically acclaimed rapper, award-winning producer, fashion designer, Donald Trump supporter, Kim Kardashian's husband - messiah?", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2876/3c1503720b8e47a89bc556b46a32a419.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
