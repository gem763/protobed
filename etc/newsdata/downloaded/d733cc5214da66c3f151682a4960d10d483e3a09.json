REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nAsked after a speech at Kansas State University how Washington had been promoting an end to the oppression of Uighurs in China, Pompeo told an audience there: \u201cInsufficiently, because it\u2019s still going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to have this U.N. General Assembly in the third week in September. We\u2019ll do a number of gatherings, where our efforts will be to get other countries to sign up to help us call out this activity,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\n\u201cWe want freedom for those folks. We have lots of challenges with China, but this is about their fundamental unalienable rights for those particular individuals.\u201d\n\nPompeo, an evangelical Christian who has portrayed himself as a champion of religious rights, reiterated past comments, saying that the treatment of the Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in China \u201cmay well end up being one of the worst stains on the world this century.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s of that magnitude,\u201d he said, adding that the challenge was to \u201crally the world\u201d against it.\n\n\u201cWe have done so today with some success, but not nearly enough, to call this out and work with the Chinese government, to convince them - to convince the Chinese Communist Party - that this isn\u2019t in their best interests ... that it\u2019s not the right way to treat ... other human beings,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nIn his speech, Pompeo charged that over the past two years in its western region of Xinjiang, China had \u201ctried to brainwash coming on one million Uighur Muslims in internment camps ... to renounce their culture and their faith.\u201d\n\nHe dismissed Chinese claims that the camps were meant to \u201ceducate and to save\u201d people influenced by religious extremism.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCHINA DEFENDS RECORD\n\nChina has consistently denied any mistreatment of Uighurs in what it calls vocational training centres, which it says have been extremely successful in combating extremism and violence.\n\nHundreds have died in unrest in Xinjiang in recent years, blamed by Beijing on Islamists and extremists. Rights groups and exiles say the violence is more a reaction against China\u2019s suppression of the Uighur people.\n\nIn a speech on tackling extremism in Xinjiang\u2019s capital Urumqi on Friday, China\u2019s deputy propaganda minister Jiang Jianguo said the world had a responsibility to come together to counter terrorism, state news agency Xinhua reported.\n\nThe international community should \u201cclearly oppose \u2018double standards\u2019 in countering terrorism and extremism, and further form a consensus and cooperate against terrorism and extremism,\u201d Xinhua cited Jiang as saying.\n\nThough the United States has ramped up criticism of China\u2019s measures in Xinjiang, it has refrained from responding with sanctions over the issue, amid on-again-off-again talks to resolve a bitter and costly trade war.\n\nThe Trump administration has been considering sanctions against Chinese officials, including Xinjiang\u2019s Communist Party chief Chen Quanguo, a member of the Chinese leadership\u2019s powerful politburo, since last year, but has held off amid Chinese threats of retaliation.\n\nSome in the U.S. Congress and other critics have been dismayed by Trump\u2019s apparent tendency to place efforts to resolve the trade dispute above human rights concerns.\n\nA White House official said on Friday that a major speech by Vice President Mike Pence that had been scheduled for June and expected to take a tough line on Beijing had been rescheduled for the fall.\n\nThe official, who did not want to be identified, said the tone of the speech would be dictated by the needs of the moment.\n\nLast October, Pence shocked some China watchers with a speech in which he laid out a litany of complaints against Beijing, chastising China for building \u201can unparalleled surveillance state\u201d and its treatment of the Uighurs.\n\nChina said on Tuesday it had lodged stern representations with the United States about previous comments by Pompeo about Xinjiang.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry said Pompeo was just repeating his old narratives to accuse China, which China firmly opposed.", "description": "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday the United States would use the United Nations General Assembly this month to persuade countries to help \"call out\" China over treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority.", "authors": ["David Brunnstrom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427104658&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8601M", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
