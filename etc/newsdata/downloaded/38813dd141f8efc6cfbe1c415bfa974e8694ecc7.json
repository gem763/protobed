Refiners also replenished stocks ahead of the national day holidays,\" said Seng Yick Tee, senior director of consultancy SIA Energy.\n\nAutumn is typically high season for refined oil consumption in China as people travel during the three-day mid-Autumn festival in September and the \"Golden Week\" National Day holiday in early October.\n\nHeavy industries, such as steelmaking and metal smelting, which are major consumers of diesel, also maintain high operating rates ahead of the winter.\n\nAnalysts expect average profit margins in September and October at oil refiners in China to hold around 250 yuan to 300 yuan ($35 to $42) a tonne, the same as during June to August.\n\nTee, however, said growth in imports in the fourth quarter may slow due to ample stockpiles and a lack of spare strategic reserve tank space.\n\nChina's customs data showed the country also exported 5.68 million tonnes of refined oil products in September, up 39.6% from a year earlier, as refiners worked to fill their annual export quotas before the end of the year.\n\nExports for the first three quarters were 47.76 million tonnes, up 8.3% from the same period last year.\n\nTotal natural gas imports in September rose 7.3% from the same period last year to 8.18 million tonnes, according to Reuters calculations based on the customs data, as the country is pushing harder to store gas before households in northern China turn on heating systems in early November.\n\nEntering the fourth year of an anti-pollution campaign, Beijing plans to add 4.93 million households to its gasification scheme this year. Over 2017 and 2018, nearly 10 million households switched from coal-fired heating equipment to gas- or electric-powered systems.\n\n($1 = 7.0709 yuan) (Reporting by Muyu Xu in Beijing and Chen Aizhu in Singapore; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Tom Hogue)", "description": "BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Oct 14 (Reuters) - China's crude oil  imports in September rose 10.8% from a year earlier as refiners  ramped up output amid stable profit...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
