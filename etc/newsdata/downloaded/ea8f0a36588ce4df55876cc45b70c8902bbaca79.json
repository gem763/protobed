But HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones won big in its final season, taking home a total 12 Emmys out of its record 32 nominations, including the statue for Outstanding Drama Series. The network\u2019s other big success story was the limited series Chernobyl, which nabbed a total of 10 statues, finishing comfortably ahead of Netflix\u2019s much-lauded When They See Us. The final tally in the HBO vs. Netflix tally was 34 to 27 in favor of HBO. Meanwhile, Amazon Prime cleaned up across the comedy categories thanks to the dynamic duo of Fleabag and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Here\u2019s Yahoo Entertainment\u2019s recap of the night\u2019s high, low and head-scratching moments.\n\nThe cast of \"Game of Thrones\" appears on stage to present an award at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards.

(Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)\n\nRight around the time that Ozark pulled off a shocking upset in two categories where Game of Thrones appeared to have an iron-clad grip on victory \u2014 Directing and Supporting Actress \u2014 some wondered whether the HBO\u2019s show\u2019s watch as an Emmy favorite had ended. But in the end, the fantasy series claimed the Emmy Throne, with its fourth win for Outstanding Drama Series. That puts Game of Thrones amongst such illustrious company as Hill Street Blues, L.A. Law, The West Wing and Mad Men, all of which were members of the four-timers\u2019 club. GoT also tied its own Emmy record with a dozen wins in a single season.\n\nLook, we can argue all day about whether or not Game of Thrones deserved to win the Outstanding Drama statue for its controversial final season. But what\u2019s absolutely not up for debate is that Emmy voters yet again missed their chance to honor a member of the show\u2019s terrific cast beyond perennial winner, Peter Dinklage. Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, Gwendoline Christie and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau were just a few members of the ensemble who deserved a statue at some point during the show\u2019s eight-season run only to be repeatedly passed over. At least showrunner D.B. Weiss took a moment to give them a shout-out after the show won Outstanding Drama: \u201cYou make everything we write better.\u201d Hey, he said it \u2014 not us!\n\nWhile many prognosticators (us included) predicted that HBO\u2019s Veep would enjoy a final season sweep, the second and last season of Amazon Prime\u2019s Fleabag proved first in Emmy voters\u2019 hearts. Creator and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge won dual statues for Outstanding Writing and Outstanding Actress \u2014 breaking Julia Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s near-perfect streak of Veep victories in that category \u2014 and the show itself claimed the Outstanding Comedy Series statues over its Amazon Prime streaming mate The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. \u201cThe reason I do it is for this,\u201d Waller-Bridge said during one of her many trips to the stage, half-jokingly referring to the Emmy in her hand.\n\nHIGH: Bryan Cranston saved the Emmys\u2026 intro\n\nView photos Homer Simpson is projected on screen at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards. (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) More\n\nFor a brief moment, it looked like Homer Simpson was about to break the cartoon barrier by becoming the first animated leading man to host the Emmys. But the usual Springfield luck held up, and the Simpson family patriarch wound up plunging through the stage floor. Into the fray leapt Black-ish star Anthony Anderson, who raced backstage to find a replacement \u2014 with a brief stop to bag some statues for himself and his mom. While that bit fell flat, Anderson did find the intro\u2019s hope and savior in the form of Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston, who took the stage and delivered the kind of earnest speech that an actual host would have had to sell in between jokes. \u201c50 years ago, Neil Armstrong walked on the moon and through the power of television, 600 million people in 53 million households walked with him. Not a bad rating.\u201d Not a bad way to begin the night either.\n\nLOW: Thomas Lennon\u2019s not-so-colorful commentary was a major bummer\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that Cranston couldn\u2019t stick around to comment on the proceedings as they unfolded. Instead, that task fell to Reno 911! mastermind Thomas Lennon, whose attempts at deadpan humor proved to be DOA. Apart from a well-aimed riposte at Felicity Huffman\u2019s jail time (\u201cHopefully those two weeks are going to fly right by,\u201d he said), most of his \u201cjokes\u201d fell flatter than his remake of The Odd Couple. It\u2019s a shame that Neil Patrick Harris apparently skipped watching the Emmys: unlike Rachel Bloom, Lennon would have deserved some mean Tweets from the former Doogie Howser.\n\nHIGH: Step out of line and salute Alex Borstein\n\nShe may have won her second Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy, but Marvelous Mrs. Maisel star Alex Borstein provided one of the night\u2019s most dramatic moments. During her acceptance speech, the actress took a moment to honor her grandmother, a Holocaust survivor who literally faced death in the face and lived to tell the tale. As Borstein told it, her grandmother was told by a Nazi soldier that the penalty of stepping out of line might be a bullet, but she took that fateful step anyway. \u201cAnd for that I am here and for that my children are here,\u201d her granddaughter said proudly. \u201cSo step out of line ladies \u2014 step out of line.\u201d\n\nLOW: They shoulda cut the mic on The Masked Singer\n\nView photos Nick Cannon, left, and Ken Jeong present at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards. (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) More\n\nLook, it only makes sense that Fox would want to hype the return of its breakout reality hit The Masked Singer. But giving the show such prominent placement on the red carpet, followed by an extended \u2014 and extremely unfunny \u2014 onstage appearance by turban-sporting host Nick Cannon and judge Ken Jeong, made us less than eager to learn the identity of Season 2\u2019s masked singer. \u201cAnd that is a career wrap on Ken Jeong,\u201d the actor joked after his and Cannon\u2019s TikTok-assisted bit bombed. Not if you get a mask, Ken\u2026\n\nHEAD-SCRATCHER: Why did only HBO shows get proper goodbyes?\n\nHBO stalwarts Game of Thrones and Veep went off the air within a week of each other, and the Emmy producers invited the casts of both shows onto the stage for a rousing farewell. But what\u2019s The Big Bang Theory \u2026 chopped liver? CBS\u2019s blockbuster sitcom also signed off for good in May, but it was relegated to a montage of other recently-] concluded shows, including Gotham and Jane the Virgin, that apparently didn\u2019t merit the HBO treatment. We\u2019ll say this: Twitter liked the Jane the Virgin finale a whole lot more than the Game of Thrones finale.\n\nHIGH: Patricia Arquette makes it personal\n\nAccepting her Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie, Patricia Arquette gave a moving tribute to her sister, transgender activist Alexis Arquette, who died of HIV-related causes in 2016. And she made it clear that the rights her sister fought for are far from won. \u201cTrans people are still being persecuted,\u201d Arquette said. \u201cThey\u2019re human beings \u2014 let\u2019s give them jobs. Let\u2019s get rid of this bias we have everywhere.\u201d\n\nLOW: They can\u2019t all be Hamilton\n\nWhen Lin-Manuel Miranda takes the stage, awesome things are generally guaranteed to follow. But that was decidedly not the case with the \u201cvariety show\u201d-themed musical number the Hamilton superstar was conscripted to introduce. The ill-conceived routine managed to waste the considerable talents of Adam Devine and Samantha Bee, and dragged out the Masked Singer cast one more time. Let it be known that Miranda\u2019s appearance doesn\u2019t equal an endorsement.\n\nHIGH: We see you, Jharrel Jerome\n\nView photos Jharrel Jerome accepts the award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for \"When They See Us.\" (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) More\n\nThe When They See Us star \u2014 and newly minted Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie \u2014 brought the crowd to their feet by reminding them that the subjects of Ava DuVernay\u2019s hit Netflix series are no longer the Central Park Five: they\u2019re the Exonerated Five. The real-life Five, whose miscarriage of justice was brilliantly dramatized on screen, were in the audience for that moment and their hard-earned freedom was never sweeter.\n\nHEAD-SCRATCHER: Who was DJing the awards?\n\nWe can only assume that the Emmy afterparty started early in the music booth, because the choices of song cues were downright bizarre all night long. In what world does a DJ cue up Ray Charles after the nuclear disaster series Chernobyl wins a statue? Forget it, Jake \u2026 it\u2019s Emmytown.\n\nHIGH: Michelle Williams is unequaled when it comes to making the case for equal pay\n\nFosse/Verdon star Michelle Williams regularly calls attention to the Hollywood pay gap, and never fails to eloquently express why it\u2019s time to pay actors and actresses equal amounts for equal work. The actress highlighted her signature issue again \u2014 one she\u2019s hand first-hand experience with \u2014 while accepting the Emmy for Outstanding Actress in a Limited Series or Movie. After thanking FX for paying her the same salary as co-star Sam Rockwell and ensuring she had all the materials she needed to properly portray Broadway legend, Gwen Verdon, she turned her focus to what the rest of the industry can do. \u201cThe next time a woman, and especially a woman of color \u2014 because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white, male counterpart\u2014tells you what she needs in order to do her job, listen to her. Believe her, because one day she might stand in front of you and say thank you for allowing [her] to succeed because of her workplace environment and not in spite of it.\u201d\n\nHIGH: We\u2019ll have what Natasha Lyonne is having\n\nRussian Doll may hav ended the night empty-handed, but the Netflix show\u2019s co-creator and leading lady, Natasha Lyonne, was living her best life all night long. Seated next to her off-camera beau, Fred Armisen, the actress was a veritable fountain of classic reaction shots \u2014 just like Jack Nicholson used to be at the Oscars. You\u2019ve heard of Orange Is the New Black? Well, we\u2019re here to tell you that Natasha is the new Jack.\n\nLOW: We wouldn\u2019t have chosen the Emmy ending for Bandersnatch\n\nThe bloom appears to be off the Black Mirror\u2019s black rose. The show\u2019s experiment in \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d storytelling, Bandersnatch, received middling reviews upon its release last December and its win for Outstanding Television Movie was met with a collective shrug online. Here\u2019s a branching path for you to follow: Netflix is about to release another Black Mirror interactive movie. Do you: (A) Watch; (B) Not Watch; (C) Binge Stranger Things again.\n\nHIGH: The category is\u2026 LOVE\n\nBilly Porter has always been a red carpet champion: now he\u2019s officially an Emmy champion. The Pose star received 10s across the board from voters, and made history as the first openly gay black actor to take home the Outstanding Actor in a Drama statue. And Porter didn\u2019t miss the opportunity to mark the occasion with his always-fabulous eloquence. Opening with the James Baldwin quote \u201cIt took many years of vomiting up all the filth I\u2019d been taught about myself, and half-believed, before I was able to walk on the earth as though I had a right to be here,\u201d Porter went on to stirringly declare: \u201cI have the right. You have the right. We all have the right!\u201d\n\nLOW: Not every show can go host-less\n\nView photos Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel speak onstage during the 71st Emmy Awards. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images) More\n\nThe Oscars made the right call to leave the \u201chost\u201d slot unoccupied, but Fox\u2019s strangely paced Emmys telecast was crying out for an emcee to keep the proceedings moving along. Professional hosts Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel argued early on that hosts shouldn\u2019t be optional (\u201cThis show sucks!\u201d they proclaimed), and by the end of the night we came to agree with them. Thanks guys! Your reward is getting to host the 2020 Emmys!\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment", "description": "\"Game of Thrones\" had big wins and big losses. \"Fleabag\" scored a surprising upset.
