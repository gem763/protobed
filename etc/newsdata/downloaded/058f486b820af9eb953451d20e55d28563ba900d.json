Using donor sperm is a process that\u2019s changed a lot in recent decades, as Alexa Tsoulis-Reay explored in a 2016 feature for the Cut \u2014 and when Jenny and her wife started looking, the experience was a little like online dating, or shopping.\n\nJENNY: It was a hundred percent online. The only time we went to the clinic was to pick up our big canister of sperm. I\u2019ll tell you, we were so excited when we started \u2014 by the time it took us a year and a half to conceive, we weren\u2019t so excited, but I still have a picture of that canister in the back seat with a seatbelt.\n\nEventually, the contents of that canister allowed them to have their beloved child. They were a family! They went to parties with other families. And one day, at one party, they found themselves in the backyard, talking to the other lesbian couple in attendance.\n\nJENNY: They had just moved to California and they had moved two blocks away from us and they seemed awesome.\n\nThey got along right away, and the other couple had a kid who was a year younger than theirs, so naturally they decided a playdate was in order.\n\nJENNY: We had invited them to our house for some wine. And in the lesbian community, you joke about what is your donor number \u2014 you throw it out. And we were joking that our kids looked so much alike that \u2026 I mean, a lot alike.\n\nOn her phone, Jenny had saved a screenshot of their donor\u2019s profile.\n\nJENNY: And so I brought it up on my phone and said, is this your donor? Really joking, thinking there\u2019s no way that it would be. And my new friend pretty much lost it.\n\nWe had just met these people, and they share the same donor? It was really, really freaky. How does that happen? With someone that just moved two streets down from me, that is in my circle of friends \u2014 and they\u2019re brothers.\n\nThis was not part of the plan when Jenny and her wife brought their canister of sperm home to start a family.\n\nJENNY: I actually thought it was like a one-in-a-thousand or -million chance it could happen, considering that the bank says they only give up to 25 family units around the world. And that means, if you\u2019ve just guessed, 25 family units, an average of two children \u2026 that\u2019s 50 siblings around the world.\n\nOK, Jenny thought. This is a crazy fluke. There is NO WAY this is going to happen again.\n\nJENNY: And then it did.\n\nTo hear what came next (and what came after that), click above, and subscribe wherever you listen.", "description": "On this week\u2019s Cut podcast, host Molly Fischer discusses ever-growing family trees with surprise sperm-donor siblings.", "authors": ["The Cut"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/16/16-cut-podcast-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
