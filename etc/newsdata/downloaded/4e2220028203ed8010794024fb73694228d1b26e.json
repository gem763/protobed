No matter how you look, you should have the same freedom at the person next to you. And it\u2019s also about equality.\u201d\n\n\u201cAddressing small parts of inequality can make a big difference in how people are treated on a day-to-day basis, and I thought free the nipple was just one small step closer to how it should be,\u201d she added.\n\nFort Collins has opted to not appeal the case to the Supreme Court, making this the end of the road for now.\n\n\u201cI think the council as they articulated in their 4-3 vote, really just thought as a matter of priority, no guarantee of success or that the Supreme Court would even take it up, that the money was just better spent on other city priorities,\u201d Fort Collins Deputy Director of Information Tyler Marr said.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not set in stone. The 10th Circuit ruling opposes a 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017, which upheld Chicago\u2019s topless ban and made women going topless illegal in Wisconsin, Indiana and Illinois.\n\nAndrew McNulty, attorney for Ms. Hoagland and Ms. Six, said the ruling addresses equal rights, but not everyone agrees.\n\nPeg Williams of Boulder, Colorado, told the network: \u201cI guess as a woman, I mean, I do think we deserve equal rights in everything, so I guess that would count, too. But I think if women who choose to do that, they might be asking for a little bit of trouble.\u201d\n\nGeorge Langel of Fort Collins said there is a contradiction between the two laws.\n\n\u201cJust seems like a contradictory of laws a woman can expose her breasts, but a man can\u2019t go in an alley behind a dumpster and take a pee without coming up on criminal charges,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
