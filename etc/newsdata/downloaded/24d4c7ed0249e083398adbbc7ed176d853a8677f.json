Listen and read through our weekly hot takes here.\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nMs Nina feat. Tomasa del Real, \"Y Dime\"\n\nMake no mistake: neoperreo is for the women. On \"Y Dime,\" Argentinian Ms Nina and Chilean Tomasa del Real flex their power as DIY pioneers while celebrating the same sexual prowess often associated with classic reggaeton.\n\n\"Te agarro y te doy rakat\u00e1,\" Tomasa offers against a bachat\u00f3n-inflected backbeat before the two clarify that this proposition doesn't include traditional feminine domestic bliss: \"Se lo hago bac\u00e1n, pero no cocino / Sabes por las u\u00f1as de tu gata fina.\"\n\nBorn quintessentially of the Internet, neoperreo fuses a digital, public sense of self that is unashamed and strives to be inclusive of all identities. Released on independent staple label Nacional Records, highlights the strides reggaeton is taking not only on YouTube and on the radio, but in the freakier, warehousier corners of the Internet. \u2014 Stefanie Fern\u00e1ndez\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nSky, J Balvin, Jhay Cortez, MadeinTYO, \"Bajo Cero\"\n\nSongwriter-producer Sky (Alejandro Ram\u00edrez) arguably possesses the monopoly the world's most ubiquitous, stylized reggaeton production as J Balvin's right-hand since the La Familia days a decade ago. Last summer, he made his first foray into lead artist territory with his single \"Karma\" featuring Balvin and Ozuna, and now delivers ice-cold production and verse on \"Bajo Cero,\" a sauntering trap tune with old friends Balvin and Jhay Cortez as well as an English verse from rapper MadeinTYO. A flute flutters in and out of the chorus that, with the help of the unspecified-high-stakes-bar-situation in the video, elevates Balvin's pining melody to Blade Runner levels of ambiance and cool-toned sound and color. \u2014 Stefanie Fern\u00e1ndez\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nFrank Garcia Y Su Son Samario, \"Peque\u00f1as Poes\u00edas\"\n\nFrank Garcia was named after Frank Sinatra by his father. Like a character from a novel by fellow Colombian Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Garcia in fact eventually fulfilled his destiny by becoming a singer in the idyllic beach town of Santa Marta. By 8 he was singing folkloric music, but when his beloved mother passed when Frank was 13, he turned inward and started putting his emotions on paper.\n\n\"Peque\u00f1as Poes\u00edas\" is the first single from his debut album as a leader after cutting his teeth as a musician in Colombia's competitive national music scene. The easy going texture of his voice is a perfect companion for the easygoing Afro Cuban (salsa) groove of this story of infatuation. An impressive first glimpse at a musician we're going to keep an eye on. \u2014 Felix Contreras\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nBeck, \"Tarantula\"\n\nThe film Roma continues to impress after it received 10 Academy Award nominations this week. To add to that juggernaut, the film's director, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, has teamed up with some folks from the music world to create and album called Music Inspired By The Film Roma.\n\nThe complete album is to be released on Feb. 8 and we get a sneak preview with a single released by Beck called \"Tarantula,\" a song that finds the vocalist surrounded by a lush string arrangement and a choir of voices on a track that hints at the loneliness displayed by the lead character in the film. Other artists featured on the upcoming album include an eclectic roster of artists ranging from Ibeyi to Patti Smith. \u2014 Felix Contreras\n\nThis playlist is updated weekly.", "description": "This week's Alt.Latino playlist stretches the boundaries of the conventional.
