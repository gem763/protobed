It feels somewhat poetic then, that the two sides will go head-to-head on Saturday night.\n\nAlmost like a TV talent show. Win and you survive for another week, lose and it will be time to pack your bags.\n\nThe managers in question are AC Milan boss Marco Giampaolo and Genoa's Aurelio Andreazzoli with Milan sat 16th and Genoa sat 18th. One point separates them after six games.\n\nAC Milan boss Marco Giampaolo is believed to have one game to save his future at the club\n\nLosing 3-1 at home to Fiorentina last time out was nothing short of a catastrophe for Milan. There was no other way to sugar coat it.\n\nGiampolo has historically started slowly at clubs - Empoli and Sampdoria never hit the ground running under him - before his philosophy became embedded in the group and he then got great results.\n\nHe has produced an entertaining brand of football in previous jobs which saw him seen as a largely popular choice to replace Gennaro Gattuso. That popularity, however, is waning by the game.\n\nResults have been poor and the board are likely to press the trigger if it goes awry against fellow strugglers Genoa.\n\nHe faces Genoa's Aurelio Andreazzoli, a manager who is also a game away from being sacked\n\nFormer Milan striker Andriy Shevchenko has been heavily linked - and was at the San Siro to watch Atalanta v Shaktar Donetsk on Tuesday - and would no doubt jump at the chance to play the hero in what is fast becoming a season to forget. Especially with bitter rivals Inter top of the pile.\n\nAnd so you have Giampaolo sweating on his future in one dugout and on the other side you have the bespectacled Andreazzoli.\n\nTalk of his sacking has been around for weeks. It says something that the board have held off this long really. A 4-0 rout away at Lazio did nothing to help his cause with former Milan boss Gattuso allegedly primed and ready to step in should Andreazzoli get the boot.\n\n'What we do need is to rely on our style of football during difficult moments and realise that is the only way forward,' the Genoa boss said recently.\n\nWhile he may think the only way forward is to follow his beliefs, the club board, should they get turned over on Saturday, will beg to differ.\n\nCONTE BACK TO HAUNT HIS OLD SIDE\n\nThere are some Juventus fans who will never forgive Antonio Conte for taking charge of rivals Inter Milan.\n\nThe fan-bases are bitter rivals in the north of Italy and add to the fact they are the two stand-out contenders for this season's title, there will be plenty of spice in Sunday's Derby D'Italia.\n\nAs Juventus boss Conte won four out of six derbies against Inter, always emerging unscathed when he was in the dugout at the San Siro.\n\nNow on the opposite side, he is looking to preserve Inter's 100 per cent start to the domestic season: six wins from six, 13 goals scored and just two conceded.\n\nMaurizio Sarri's Juve tripped up on the road by drawing a blank against Fiorentina. Trip up again against their biggest threat to the title and Conte's popularity rating in Turin could drop through the floor.\n\nAntonio Conte is ready to come back and haunt old club Juventus as he faces them with Inter\n\nATALANTA'S HOME COMFORTS\n\nWEEKEND FIXTURES POSTPONED Brescia v Sassuolo SATURDAY SPAL v Parma (2pm) Hellas Verona v Sampdoria (5pm) Genoa v AC Milan (7:45pm) SUNDAY Fiorentina v Udinese (11:30am) Atalanta v Lecce (2pm) Roma v Cagliari (2pm) Bologna v Lazio (2pm) Torino v Napoli (5pm) Inter Milan v Juventus (7:45pm)\n\nAfter another night to forget in their maiden Champions League campaign - a last-minute strike from Shakhtar Donetsk saw them slip to a 2-1 defeat - Atalanta will be grateful to finally return home.\n\nTheir European games have been taking place at Milan's San Siro - a place they will never truly settle at. Bergamo is home and on Sunday lunchtime, they finally go back.\n\nMany of the games so far have been away - perhaps a deliberate decision given the renovation at their ground - but the two 'home' matches against Torino and Fiorentina took place at Parma's Ennio Tardini. They failed to win either.\n\nGian Piero Gasperini's side have shown no sign of a European hangover this season, scoring the most goals from the opening six Serie A games and back at the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d'Italia, La Dea will be determined to return with a bang.\n\nLecce's two wins so far have both come on the road - at Torino and SPAL - and they would love nothing more than playing the party-poopers on Atalanta's return to Bergamo.\n\nAtalanta want to forget another Champions League defeat as they finally return to Bergamo\n\nELSEWHERE... MERTENS CHASES MARADONA\n\nDries Mertens can barely stop smiling these days.\n\nThe Belgian is starring for Carlo Ancelotti's side and has a club legend's record in his sights - none other than Diego Armando Maradona.\n\nMertens can beat Maradona's tally of 115 goals for the club when Ancelotti's side travel to face Torino on Sunday afternoon.\n\nHaving sat out the 4-1 rout against Lecce on gameweek four, Mertens has four goals from the other five Serie A games so far and is determined to go and land the top scorer gong come the end of the season.\n\nDries Mertens is looking to beat Diego Maradona's all-time scoring total as a Napoli player\n\nWhile Mertens is chasing a place in history - he would go second on the all-time list at the club behind Marek Hamsik (121 goals) - other clubs are seeking a win by any means possible.\n\nRock-bottom Sampdoria face a must-win trip to Hellas Verona as Eusebio Di Francesco continues to battle to save his job.\n\nFour goals scored and 14 conceded isn't helping his cause right now - it has to change, starting on Sunday.\n\nSPAL are also in trouble, even at this early stage. They host a Parma side full of confidence, currently in ninth following a dramatic late win against Torino last time out.\n\nRoberto Inglese was the hero two minutes from time to break the visiting hearts. With SPAL's confidence already incredibly fragile, further anguish against I Gialloblu could set them back for weeks.\n\nElsewhere, Fiorentina welcome fellow strugglers Udinese, Radja Nainggolan gets a reunion with Roma as Cagliari travel to the Stadio Olimpico and Bologna take on free-scoring Lazio.\n\nAnd finally, Friday night's clash between Brescia and Sassuolo has been postponed as a mark of respect following the death of Sassuolo's owner and president Giorgio Squinzi.", "description": "Two managers have been told they have one game to save their jobs.
