Although illnesses including anxiety and depression aren\u2019t a new phenomenon, research proves that mental health issues are at an all time high \u2014 and national health services, like the NHS, are struggling to keep up with the growing need for more accessible resources.\n\nMultiple studies have proven that technology, specifically social media, is detrimental to people\u2019s mental wellbeing. However, tech is taking on some of the responsibility to help those struggling with their mental health. One project is the \u201cFlow\u201d app, developed by the Malm\u00f6-based medical device company, Flow Neuroscience. The chatbot therapist aims to help those struggling with their mental health while they wait to be seen by a medical professional.\n\nThe free app, which is currently available on iOS \u2014 set to launch on Android within the month \u2014 engages users in daily conversations to offer self-help techniques, mood tracking features, curated videos to better visualize mental health, and meditation and mental exercises.\n\nThe app was created by a team of clinical psychologists and machine learning experts and is based on the latest psychology and neuroscience research. The virtual therapist guides users through 18 sessions on why sleep, exercise, nutrition, and meditation are the main pillars in recovering from depression while gathering mood data to offer personalized behavioral therapy.\n\nScreenshot from a conversation with the virtual therapist.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018always-on\u2019 source of therapy provided by Flow ensures people get the help they need as quickly as possible,\u201d Daniel Mansson, Clinical Psychologist, CEO and Co-Founder of Flow said in a press release. \u201cFlow can provide anonymity without the fear of being judged by others. This is great as some people feel anxious when it comes to talking about their depression to another human.\u201d\n\nWhile there\u2019s hundreds of apps out there to help you better understand meditation and mindfulness, there\u2019s been little innovation in regards to treating depression. However Flow has been approved in the UK and EU to treat major depressive disorder effectively. The chatbot also works alongside Flow\u2019s headset, a behavioral therapy brain stimulator to treat depression without the need for medication.\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine and the British Journal of Psychiatry, outline that brain stimulation \u2013 of the type used in the Flow headset \u2013 had a similar impact to antidepressants but with fewer and less-severe side effects.\n\nDepression is associated with lowered activity in an area in the front of the brain, as explained by the video above. According to Flow\u2019s findings, 24 percent of its users overcame their depression completely while 41 percent felt at least 50 percent better after 6 weeks of brain stimulation treatment.\n\nCurrently, Flow is in talks with the NHS to potentially make its headset available on prescription, but for the moment it costs \u00a3399 in the UK.\n\nAs the company outlines, this type of behavioral therapy may not work for everyone, just like prescribed medication doesn\u2019t. While technology may not be the answer to diagnosing, treating, and preventing mental health illness, it\u2019s exciting to see how innovative technology is being used for good while reducing some of the strain placed on the NHS.\n\nRead next: UN-backed chocolate bar comes with a free blockchain token \u2014 and a choice", "description": "The \u201cFlow\u201d app aims to help those struggling with their mental health while they wait\u00a0 to be seen by a medical professional.", "authors": ["Cara Curtis"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2F200-calories-2-3.png&signature=0c2ec8a1c0fdfacb811aedfa159a6a2b", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
