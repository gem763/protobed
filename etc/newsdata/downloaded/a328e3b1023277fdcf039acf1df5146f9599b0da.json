Respondents were told several different occupations, among them U.S. president, and asked if social media companies should penalize a person in that position if they are found to have circulated offensive content from their account.\n\nSeventy-four percent of people surveyed said the U.S. president should face some sort of repercussions if he or she shares offensive content online: 36% said they should be temporarily suspended in such a situation, and 38% said they would have be outright banned.\n\nThirteen percent of respondents said the U.S. president should be neither suspended nor banned for sharing offensive content on social media, and 13% said they had no opinion.\n\nRespondents answered nearly identically in response to similar questions about other occupations, however. Nearly eight-in-ten people surveyed said that politicians, business leaders, journalists, movie stars and celebrities who share offensive content on social media should be accordingly banned or suspended, suggesting respondents largely agree that posting offensive content on social media should result in some sort of repercussion regardless of the person responsible.\n\nConducted by Morning Consult, the same survey of 2,200 adults found that 59% want the government to have a hand in crafting the content moderation policies used by social media companies, and that only 10% reported currently having a \u201cgreat deal of confidence\u201d in companies successfully removing offensive content from their platform.\n\nMr. Trump is a prolific and popular Twitter user, and he regularly relies on the platform to instantly reach millions of social media followers. Critics of the president have previously called his tweets into question, however, including posts that have teetered on violating the platform\u2019s terms of service.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar, Minnesota Democrat, called on Twitter to suspend Mr. Trump after he shared a tweet last month that falsely implied she had been dancing during the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\n\u201cThe President of the United States is continuing to spread lies that put my life at risk,\u201d Ms. Omar tweeted in response. \u201cWhat is Twitter doing to combat this misinformation?\u201d\n\nMore recently, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was pressed by a White House hopeful last week to suspend Mr. Trump\u2019s account after he tweeted a series of attacks targeting the intelligence community whistleblower that triggered Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\n\u201cThese are blatant threats,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris, California Democrat, said regarding Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets about the whistleblower. \u201cWe need a civil society, not a civil war.\u201d\n\nTwitter does not screen or remove potentially offensive content, but it may consider targeted abuse or harassment as a violation of the platform\u2019s rules, according to the company.\n\nThe company announced in June new policies in June for tweets that might violated the platform\u2019s policies but might otherwise be in the public\u2019s interest, including tweets from certain government officials. Twitter said it would add a notice to those tweets \u201cto provide additional context and clarity,\u201d adding that they would also not be \u201calgorithmically elevated.\u201d\n\nFacebook has since come under fire from for allowing an ad placed by Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign attacking Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, meanwhile. Both the Biden campaign and Democratic National Committee took issue with the ads and said they should be removed for being misleading, but Facebook said in a letter this week that the ads do not violate any of the platform\u2019s policies and will accordingly remain running.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
