Then he was steamed.\n\n\u201cI looked at the label, and it wasn\u2019t rice at all. It was cauliflower,\u201d said Mr. Hillman, a Republican state legislator who grows rice at his farm in Almyra. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Well, how can they get by with this?\u2019\u201d\n\nHis bill requiring \u201ctruth in labeling\u201d for edible agricultural products was approved in March as the ranching and farming industries sought to protect their brands from being confused with the many plant-based items cropping up on supermarket shelves.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has another word for it: censorship.\n\nACLU attorneys were in federal court Monday on behalf of Tofurky seeking to block the Arkansas law, which prohibits fake beef, poultry, pork and rice makers from adopting labels with terms associated with the real stuff.\n\nThat would include Tofurky favorites such as \u201csausages,\u201d \u201cbrats\u201d and \u201croasts,\u201d even though CEO Jaime Athos insisted that consumers opt for such foods \u201cnot because they are confused or misled, but because they are savvy and educated about the health and environmental consequences of eating animal products.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhrases like \u2018veggie burger\u2019 are well-established in common vernacular and help consumers choose a plant-based alternative that works best for their favorite dishes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope to block this unconstitutional law from being enforced so that consumers can continue to have access to familiar plant-based products in Arkansas, and ultimately across the United States.\u201d\n\nArkansas is one of eight agricultural states to enact laws against \u201cmisleading\u201d labels on synthetic and plant-based foods in the absence of national rules on the growing cornucopia of faux meat and dairy products.\n\nSales of plant-based meat and milks grew by 17% last year, outpacing total retail food sales, which increased by 2%. The fake meats accounted for $684 million in sales, while the \u201cmilks\u201d made from almonds, cashews, soy beans and more reached $1.8 billion, according to the Good Food Institute, a trade association for the industry.\n\n\u201cSooner or later, the FDA and the USDA are going to have to come out with standards,\u201d said Mr. Hillman. \u201cThat was an impetus behind this bill. If enough states would call attention to this problem, they would have to do something.\u201d\n\nThe trend is expected to heat up as fast-food chains introduce their own meatless patties. Burger King is selling the Impossible Whopper, and McDonald\u2019s is test-marketing its Garden Gourmet Incredible Burger in Germany.\n\n\u201cLabel censorship will result in misleading labels and fewer options for consumers,\u201d said the Good Food Institute, a plaintiff in the Arkansas case.\n\nColin Woodall, CEO of the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, argued that the meatless products are piggybacking off years of branding and advertising by ranchers, citing, for example, Beyond Meat\u2019s \u201cBeyond Beef\u201d products, or other non-meat items labeled \u201cbeefy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not believe any of these plant-based products should use the term \u2018beef\u2019 at all,\u201d Mr. Woodall said. \u201cBeef is something that has been associated with us for millennia, and what they\u2019re trying to do is replicate or imitate without coming up with their own nomenclature.\u201d\n\nChanging common food names has happened before. U.S. farmers rebranded the \u201calligator pear\u201d as the \u201cavocado,\u201d sending sales soaring, although backers of plant-based foods call it unrealistic to demand that the industry create new terms for commonplace items such as \u201chamburgers\u201d and \u201chot dogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one knows what a \u2018veggie disc\u2019 is, and to force our client to use such a label is absurd and unconstitutional,\u201d said Brian Hauss, staff attorney for the ACLU\u2019s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. \u201cThis law is creating consumer confusion and censoring businesses from communicating truthfully about their products.\u201d\n\nThe Arkansas bill has been blasted as an effort by the Farm Bureau and cattlemens associations to beat back competition, but Mr. Hillman insisted it\u2019s just common sense. His bill had virtually no opposition as it rolled through the state General Assembly. It passed the Senate by a vote of 31-3 and the House by a vote of 87-4.\n\n\u201cBurger King is now selling meatless hamburgers. They\u2019re very upfront about it, they say exactly what it is, there\u2019s no meat, and I say, more power to them. If that\u2019s what the public wants, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to give them,\u201d Mr. Hillman said. \u201cBut don\u2019t sell one thing and call it something else. Don\u2019t sell a Cadillac and call it a Chevrolet.\u201d\n\nIn its response, the Arkansas attorney general\u2019s office argued that the request for a preliminary injunction is unnecessary given that the state has opted not to enforce the law until the legal battle is resolved. It also said the case is unlikely to succeed on the merits.\n\n\u201cAs an initial matter, Tofurky\u2019s misleading commercial speech is not protected by the First Amendment,\u201d said the brief.\n\nOther states approving truth in labeling laws are Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. In February, the ACLU reached a settlement with Missouri officials after challenging the state law.\n\nMr. Hillman said the Arkansas legislation, Act 501, is the most innocuous of the state laws because it doesn\u2019t include faux dairy products and imposes fines of $1,000 per violation, but no criminal penalties.\n\n\u201cIt was probably the uncontroversial thing that I have done,\u201d said Mr. Hillman. \u201cI don\u2019t want to punish anybody. I just want people to label their stuff right.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
