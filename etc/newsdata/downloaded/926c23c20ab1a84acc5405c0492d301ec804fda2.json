Buttigieg then jumped into the fray, saying, \u201cThe damn bill that [Sanders] wrote, and that Senator Warren backs \u2026 doesn\u2019t trust the American people.\u201d\n\nThe digs became more personal from there. Biden attacked Sanders directly for his leftist politics, saying, \u201cLet me tell you something: For a Socialist, you have a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.\u201d\n\nIt all crescendoed with Julian Castro saying Biden\u2019s plan would require a buy-in, while his own would not. \u201cThey do not have to buy in! They do not have to buy in!\u201d Biden shouted in response.\n\n\u201cYou just said that two minutes ago!\u201d Castro said, adding what might have been a jab at Biden\u2019s age: \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d\n\nIt makes sense that the candidates would let their major schisms play out in the health-care space. It\u2019s one of the few domains in which their views reflect a total difference in kind, rather than in degree. The next question was about racism, which nearly everyone agrees is bad. But the Democrats fundamentally disagree on what to do about health care in America. Biden and a few others want to improve on Obamacare, while Warren and Sanders want to completely overhaul the system and replace it with U.K.-style single-payer. The vision that prevails will affect Americans\u2019 lives in sweeping ways.\n\nPlus, perhaps they\u2019ve learned from the winner of the 2016 election that the nice guy doesn\u2019t always finish first in politics. The Democrats are willing to try to get through to voters\u2014even if it\u2019s by using brashness and sarcasm.\n\nAfter the tense exchange between Castro and Biden, Buttigieg raced in to be the civility police: \u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d he said. \u201cThis reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s called the Democratic-primary election, Pete,\u201d Castro retorted.\n\nThat it is, and if tonight is a guide, it\u2019s heating way up.", "description": "In the latest Democratic presidential debate, the candidates stopped being polite and started getting real.", "authors": ["Olga Khazan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_1174325155/facebook.jpg?1568340768", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
