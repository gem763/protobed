This second scandal, it seems, proved too much for some supporters. The party won just over 16 percent of the vote in Sunday\u2019s election, significantly lower than expected and nearly 10 points below its result in 2017. A renewed coalition with the \u00d6VP\u2014which, rather than being harmed by Ibiza, made significant gains\u2014is theoretically still possible, but has become much less likely; FP\u00d6 leaders all suggested they planned to go into opposition and rebuild.\n\nTo be clear, this is what\u2014at least under normal political circumstances\u2014is supposed to happen to a political party entangled in not one but two major corruption scandals. But Sunday\u2019s result also showed that, come what may, the FP\u00d6 effectively has a relatively high electoral floor: a voter base of about 15 percent of the population that, no matter the scale of its scandals, stands by it. That number may be lower than the party had hoped, but it would still be the envy of its populist far-right counterparts in many corners of Europe\u2014and is higher than the last time the FP\u00d6 found itself in the midst of a government collapse.\n\nYascha Mounk: A Russia scandal even populists couldn\u2019t stomach\n\nPost-Ibiza Austria is a study in the extent to which populist politicians can hold onto their base in the face of scandal\u2014something the United States, after two and a half years of President Donald Trump in the White House, knows quite well. A combination of the FP\u00d6\u2019s quick damage control, its ability to consistently portray itself as a victim, and its voters\u2019 skepticism of mainstream media and fierce, long-standing loyalty to the party have helped it hold onto its core base of die-hard supporters.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, the results were pretty bad,\u201d Mario Misch, an FP\u00d6 supporter from Vienna, told me at the party\u2019s election-night event as he nursed a beer. \u201cBut still, we didn\u2019t lose\u2014we actually won, because the party still had voters, and those voters stand by their decision.\u201d\n\nMisch said he never considered changing his vote or staying home: \u201cThere\u2019s no other party that has policies like the FP\u00d6,\u201d he said, \u201cand the FP\u00d6\u2019s policies are actually how I want to live my life.\u201d\n\nThough Sunday\u2019s results were a clear disappointment for the FP\u00d6, the party\u2019s recent history shows things could have been far worse. Back in 2002, when the party\u2019s far-right wing staged an internecine takeover, bitter infighting helped drop the FP\u00d6\u2019s support to just 10 percent, compared with 27 percent in 1999.", "description": "Austria\u2019s Freedom Party was caught up in not one, but two major pre-election scandals, and suffered at the polls.
