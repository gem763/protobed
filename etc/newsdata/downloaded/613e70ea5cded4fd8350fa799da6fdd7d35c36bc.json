Rather\u2019s forged documents claimed to prove that then-President George W. Bush had gone AWOL while serving in the Texas Air National Guard.\n\nAfter a bunch of everyday people on the Internet debunked those documents, the era of New Media was born.\n\nWhat died, though, was any hope for the CBS Evening News to regain its stature. Eventually, Rather was fired. Since then, the telecast has remained in third place, but nothing as bad as what we are seeing now with Norah O\u2019Donnell at the helm.\n\nThe New York Post:\n\nIn the last week alone, O\u2019Donnell\u2019s total viewers plunged 17 percent to 5.1 million, according to Nielsen. Among viewers in the crucial demographic ages 25 to 54 that\u2019s coveted by advertisers, the drop was a heart-stopping 25 percent. The slide has steadily accelerated during the past month, with weekly ratings in the key age group falling between 20 and 29 percent versus a year ago. That\u2019s far steeper than the single-digit drops during the year-and-a-half tenure of her predecessor Jeff Glor, who was pulling down $2 million a year, according to a source.\n\nO\u2019Donnell earns $7 million per year \u2014 well, \u201cearns\u201d is probably not as accurate as \u201cis given for reasons that have nothing to do with production or performance.\u201d\n\nHere are the stark numbers for the 2018-2019 season so far:\n\nABC\u2019s World News Tonight: 8.6 million\n\nNBC Nightly News: 7.9 million\n\nCBS Evening News: 5.8 million\n\nAnd that 5.8 million dropped to 5.1 million last week, and that number has been sinking steadily since O\u2019Donnell replaced Glor in July.\n\nThe problem is not that O\u2019Donnell is a woman. For the five or so seasons she anchored World News Tonight, Diane Sawyer\u2019s ratings were good to great and climbing as she exited.\n\nNo, the problem is O\u2019Donnell, who has all the warmth of a great white shark.\n\nGranted, Glor wasn\u2019t exactly lighting the world on fire, but his unceremonious firing has dropped the network from \u201chonorable\u201d to \u201cdismal\u201d in just a few short months.\n\nAs I wrote previously, moving O\u2019Donnell from the third place CBS This Morning to the CBS Evening News made next to no sense. If she didn\u2019t shine in the morning, what made CBS believe she would do any better in the evening?\n\nIt\u2019s like CNN\u2019s decision to move Chris Cuomo from his failed morning show to what is now his failed evening show.\n\nBut, you know, while the media would like to attract viewers, the far-left political agenda comes first, which is why leftists like Cuomo and O\u2019Donnell are allowed to fail upwards.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
