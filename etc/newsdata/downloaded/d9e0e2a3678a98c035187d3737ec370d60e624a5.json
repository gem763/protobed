(AP) - To hear Ben Platt describe it, producer Ryan Murphy\u2019s pitch for him to star in the new Netflix series \u201cThe Politician\u201d had all the planning, precision and vision of a successful presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018OK, the show is called \u2018The Politician.\u2019 The character\u2019s Peyton Hobart. This is the content of the character. I want Gwyneth Paltrow to play a mother. The world\u2019s going to look like this. This is going to be eight episodes. If we go this many seasons, you\u2019ll end up here,\u201d Platt said of their meeting.\n\nPlatt signed on after hearing Murphy\u2019s description of the character: a \u201cborderline sociopathic-egomaniacal-ambitious witty man.\u201d It\u2019s a departure from Platt\u2019s star-making role, the sweet, socially awkward title character of \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so, to me, that was, as an actor, the most delicious possible possibility,\u201d Platt said.\n\nPlatt\u2019s Hobart will go to any lengths to achieve his dream of becoming president of the United States. But, first, he must win over voters in his high school election, which is a lot harder than it sounds.\n\nMurphy, the Emmy-winning producer behind \u201cGlee\u201d and \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d offered Platt other enticements, including an executive producer credit.\n\n\u201c(That) allowed me to have some sort of creative ownership over it that I have been able to have in the theater, but not really anywhere else as of yet,\u201d the Tony Award winner said. \u201cAnd so that was really attractive to me.\u201d\n\nPlatt wasn\u2019t the only actor who Murphy wooed with a perfect pitch. Jessica Lange, who has won two Emmy Awards starring in Murphy\u2019s \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d series, said the producer knew just how to get her to sign on.\n\n\u201cHe reels me in because he knows what I like and what\u2019s going to kind of trigger my imagination right away,\u201d said Lange, who plays the shady grandmother of Hobart\u2019s running mate. \u201cSo, then he\u2019ll drop the couple things here and there, you know: \u2018She went to Hollywood. She wanted to be Vanna White. She\u2019s from West Virginia. She got pregnant when she was a teenager. She was . \u2018 And I can see it all coming. And it\u2019s never a surprise to me, but it\u2019s always tremendously entertaining. So, you know, I end up saying, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn addition to Platt and Lange, the series that debuts Friday adds the star power of Paltrow and Oscar nominee Bob Balaban.\n\nMurphy crams the first eight episodes of \u201cThe Politician\u201d with so much political scandal that the series could be perceived as over the top.\n\nBut not today, Lange said.\n\n\u201cOur politics have somehow devolved into such an absolute (expletive) show,\u201d she said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t make it more absurd than it is in reality. I mean, you couldn\u2019t make this story up that\u2019s going on in America right now. So, you know, as weird as Ryan wants to spin this story, it\u2019s not going to get weirder than what is actually happening.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "To hear Ben Platt describe it, producer Ryan Murphy's pitch for him to star in the new Netflix series \"The Politician\" had all the planning, precision and vision of a successful presidential campaign.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mike Cidoni Lennox"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/britain_the_politician_premiere_13980_c0-142-3400-2124_s1770x1032.jpg?c52a0096a216a79ba5fcf65096afe65401717e03", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
