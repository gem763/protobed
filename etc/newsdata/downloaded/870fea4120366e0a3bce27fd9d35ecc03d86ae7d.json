But that doesn\u2019t absolve the Bidens.", "language": "en", "text": "But here is what is incontestably true: Joe Biden had a conflict of interest. His son took a position with a Ukrainian natural gas company, despite having no experience in Ukraine or natural gas, the very same month the elder Biden visited Kiev and urged Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. As Yoshiko Herrera, an expert in Russia and Eurasia policy at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, put it, \u201cconflict-of-interest rules should have applied. If Biden is working for the Obama administration on Ukraine, his son should not have been on the board of a company there that could be affected by U.S. policy spearheaded by his father.\u201d\n\nThe latest spin is that there is nothing to see here because, as Reuters reports, the investigation of Burisma \u201cfocused solely on activity that took place before Hunter Biden, son of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, was hired to sit on its board.\u201d Did it occur to anyone that maybe that is precisely why Burisma hired the American vice president\u2019s son? According to the New York Times, Biden\u2019s hiring \u201callowed Burisma to create the perception that it was backed by powerful Americans.\u201d As Robert Weissman, president of the progressive watchdog Public Citizen, has said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to avoid the conclusion that Hunter\u2019s foreign employers and partners were seeking to leverage Hunter\u2019s relationship with Joe, either by seeking improper influence or to project access to him.\u201d The revelation that Hunter Biden accepted a job with a Ukrainian company that was under investigation while his father was taking the lead in fighting corruption in Ukraine is damning, not exculpatory.", "description": "", "authors": ["Marc Thiessen", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Yes-Trump-Did-Something-Wrong-That-Doesnt-Absolve-Bidens"], "top_image": ""}
