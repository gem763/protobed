I wish the NBA would acknowledge that,\" Pompeo said during a speech in Nashville.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver further angered China by defending Morey's right to speak out, but the NBA still pressed ahead with its tour, though in a stripped-down form with every scheduled media or public event cancelled.\n\nThe league said Friday it would be unfair to force the teams to field media questions in China on the \"complicated and unprecedented situation.\"\n\nThe NBA has run into what many other foreign businesses also have learned the hard way -- Beijing demands they respect Chinese political sensibilities if they want access to its huge market.\n\n\"But if you give in (to China) too much, you start to anger your core (US) demographic,\" said Mark Dreyer, who runs the China Sports Insider website.\n\n\"It's almost a lose-lose for the NBA.\"\n\nOn the court, the mood has been more positive, with fans wildly cheering the players, especially Lakers superstar LeBron James.\n\nShenzhen authorities issued a public notice banning provocative banners or gestures at the game.\n\nBut, as in Shanghai, some individuals in Shenzhen expressed their anger at the league.\n\nSome users posted pictures on Chinese social media burning their game tickets outside the venue Saturday, while others arrived in t-shirts bearing messages like \"Hong Kong, Taiwan, and my soul belong to China.\"\n\nThe NBA is expected to largely survive the crisis due to its dominant position as perhaps the most popular sports league in China, where giants billboards showing players like James and Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry are common.\n\n\"There are too many smart people on both sides who will find a way to move past this,\" Dreyer said.", "description": "The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 91-77 on Saturday to conclude a pre-season China tour that leaves behind big questions over the future of a...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/15/wire-19628952-1570892265-374_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
