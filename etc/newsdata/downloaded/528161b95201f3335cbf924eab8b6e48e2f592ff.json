As Ben is left terrified for her safety, he insists to Martin Fowler (James Bye) that he helps him save Lola \u2013 and get revenge.\n\nIt\u2019s clear to all that Ben is not ready to back down in his battle with Kheerat (Jaz Deal) and Jags (Amar Adatia) but perhaps he has underestimated them as they aim to hit him where it hurts.

But will this just anger the Panesars more and will Martin regret becoming involved?\n\nIt remains to be seen what happens to Lola and how Ben will repay his new enemies for them crossing a line with him but this is just the next step in a long running feud. Meanwhile, Martin realises he is trapped as Ben reminds him of everything he has on him \u2013 not only does he have evidence that Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) attacked Phil (Steve McFadden) but now Martin is almost as deep as him in the crime war with the Panesars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKheerat will make it clear to Ben that they won\u2019t stop at kidnapping Lola either as a chilling threat puts Lexi in the firing line.
