(Edward Wood/Flickr)\n\nToday was a \u201cstep down\u201d kind of day. We stepped from summerlike conditions back toward something more typical for this time of year. We\u2019ll take another step tomorrow, and it\u2019s one that will deliver us a delightful day.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: Clearing skies and decreasing humidity should lead us to a seasonably cool night. Most spots end up in the 50s, but it will be closer to 60 in the urban centers. Some parts of the north and the west could even sneak an upper-40s. Winds are light out of the north and northeast.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Wednesday): Clouds were a bit stubborn today, but that shouldn\u2019t be the case tomorrow. Skies will be partly to mostly sunny, and humidity will be low. Add in highs in the mid-70s to near 80, and I dare you not to call in sick (or take a long lunch). Winds will be out of the northeast around 5 mph to 10 mph.\n\nSee Matt Rogers\u2019s forecast through the weekend.

The average first 40s low there comes Sept. 12. Last year, it wasn\u2019t until Oct. 12. Inside the Beltway, we still may have a ways to go. The average first low in the 40s for the District comes along Oct 4.\n\nIn the meantime, here\u2019s some snow in the mountains of California on Monday. Think cool.\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
