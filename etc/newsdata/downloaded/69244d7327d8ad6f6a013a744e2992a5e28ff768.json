The sector has also seen a 36 per cent growth in compound annual growth rate by NLA.\n\nThat being said, pace of growth might slow to 15 per cent due to a higher base and tighter vacancies, the real estate firm said in a report out on Tuesday.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nFlexible workspaces now account for 5 per cent of Central Business District (CBD) Premium and Grade A offices, said the report.\n\nIn terms of distribution, 83 per cent of flexible workspace resides in the CBD, 12 per cent in the city fringe and 5 per cent in the suburban area.\n\nWithin the CBD, 52 per cent of co-working spaces are located in Raffles Place or New Downtown, followed by 22 per cent at Shenton Way or Tanjong Pagar. City Hall takes up 16 per cent of the distribution, while Orchard Road takes up 7 per cent and Beach Road and Bugis takes up 3 per cent.\n\nWhen it comes to market share, the leading co-working operator in Singapore is WeWork which holds a 22 per cent share of the pie or 850,000 sq ft in portfolio size.\n\nNext is IWG at 16.6 per cent with 640,000 sq ft, followed by JustGroup at 12.8 per cent and 498,000 sq ft.\n\nAfter consolidation in the sector, the top seven operators now hold 65 per cent of the market share, with the top three \u2013 WeWork, IWG, and JustGroup \u2013 sitting on 51 per cent of the space.\n\nColliers said bigger operators have been scaling up their portfolios aggressively, while some of the smaller operators with no economies ofscale were either acquired or squeezed out. Based on its research, most of the closures came from small-sized, single-space operators, with an average floor space of 7,500 sq ft.\n\nColliers\u2019 head of research Tricia Song said Singapore is considered \u201cone of the most mature\u201d markets in Asia for flexible workspace. She added: \u201cWe believe it will continue to advance and expand, given the still-low penetration rate of 5 per cent.\"\n\nDue to the competitive landscape, average desk cost fell 12 per cent to US$573 per month, from a year ago. Colliers added that desk rates could also decline further, with lower space allocation per desk to maintain margins. This is due to a trend seen in London which is regarded as the most mature flexible market in the world.\n\nTo expand, operators may also expand into fringe areas of the retail or hotel space due to tight vacancy in the CBD.\n\nContinued consolidation is expected in the industry through continued collaboration between landlords and flexible workspace operations; as well as mergers and acquisitions among smaller operators, or international operators looking to enter new markets.\n\nThe outlook on the sector would also \u201cchange significantly\u201d should conventional landlords launch their own co-working products and enter the market as opposed to offering long-term leases to established operators.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Real Estate - CO-WORKING spaces\u00a0now take up 3.7 million square feet (sq ft) in net lettable area (NLA) of Singapore's commercial space, tripling from 1.2 million sq ft in 2015 to become\u00a0one of the top six occupier sectors, said Colliers International. .
