It is frankly bizarre that Monica\u2019s entire backstory was that she used to be fat. Ross should probably have been given a restraining order for breaking into his ex-girlfriend\u2019s house.\n\nThe age of comfort TV: why people are secretly watching Friends and The Office on a loop Read more\n\nBut complaining about the show\u2019s quality, rather than its politics, seems to miss the point. I love Friends. I watched every episode as it aired, and have rewatched many since. I will undoubtedly do so again. It is also \u2013 by any objective, technical standard \u2013 not that great. And that\u2019s entirely OK.\n\nFriends\u2019 success has never relied on it being the best of its genre. It\u2019s a classic in part because it doesn\u2019t worry about such things; it offers simplicity, a perfect formula of effortless wellbeing.\n\nThat\u2019s why all the think pieces questioning whether Friends is as good as Seinfeld are misdirected; the suggestion being that \u201cproving\u201d Friends is inferior is somehow a hot burn. Expecting Chandler Bing to hold up to one of the wittiest comedies of all time is like asking my pyjamas to get the same reception as a Dior dress. One is fluffy comfort and the other world-class, but when I\u2019m 20 minutes into a KFC family bucket, nothing beats my elastic waistband.\n\nFriends\u2019 fans are the noble champions against high art: that on the right day, watching Dirty Dancing can be just as valuable as Citizen Kane. Enjoy the endless re-runs without shame. The One where Friends is Analysed to Death is not an episode any of us need to see.", "description": "There are, of course, valid criticisms to be made regarding the politics of the 1990s sitcom.
