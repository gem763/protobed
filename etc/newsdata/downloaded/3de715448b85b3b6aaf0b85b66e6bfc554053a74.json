The company known as China\u2019s Tesla did it in four.\n\nThe bleeding continues. Shanghai-based NIO Inc. is poised to report Tuesday that it lost another 2.6 billion yuan ($369 million) \u2014 around $4 million a day \u2014 during the second quarter, according to the average of two analyst estimates. That would bring accumulated losses at the company, which is backed by technology giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., to about $5.7 billion since William Li founded the carmaker in 2014.\n\nCost overruns, weak sales, and major recalls have led NIO to plunge 74% since its market value hit a record $11.9 billion about a year ago. More broadly, the company\u2019s reversal of fortune illustrates why concerns are mounting that China created an electric-vehicle bubble that may be about to burst.\n\n\u201cThis year and the next, there\u2019s going to be a lot of card-shuffling for these EV startups,\u201d said Siyi Mi, an analyst at BloombergNEF. \u201cBefore, venture capital chased after them, but it\u2019s not the case any more.\u201d\n\nTotal EV sales in China, where half of the world\u2019s electric cars are sold, fell for the first time in July after the government scaled back subsidies. Deliveries dropped again in August, raising doubts that one of the final pillars of strength in China\u2019s broader auto market, which has fallen 14 out of the past 15 months, is wavering.\n\nChina has gradually scaled back subsidies for new-energy vehicles \u2014 all-electric, fuel-celled autos and plugin hybrids \u2014 since 2017 to help the industry stand on its own two feet and avoid a bubble. That\u2019s undermined growth, prompting the likes of top Chinese electric-carmaker BYD Co. to warn recently that earnings will wane.\n\nAt NIO, pressure is building for it to raise more funds. The carmaker is seeking to reduce its workforce by 14% to 7,500 by the end of the month, according to the company. Incidents involving batteries catching fire or spewing smoke forced NIO to recall about 4,800 vehicles -- more than 20% of all the cars it\u2019s ever sold. Second-quarter deliveries dropped from the preceding three-month period.\n\nThe company also scrapped plans for a manufacturing plant in Shanghai after the government opted to provide financial support to Tesla. Instead, NIO farms out production of its ES6 and ES8 cars to Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Co.\n\nAnd even though Tencent and Li each plowed $100 million into NIO this month, the capital-intensive nature of the automobile industry means that \u201cthis much money won\u2019t last long,\u201d said Bill Russo, founder and CEO at Automobility Ltd., a Shanghai-based auto advisory firm.\n\nLi has played down his company\u2019s challenges, saying in an interview in June that NIO\u2019s stock rout was \u201cno big deal\u201d and that investors needed to understand that making new cars costs money.\n\nBut money is in short supply for the carmaker, which is now counting on receiving as much as 10 billion yuan in funding from an investment firm backed by the Beijing city government.\n\nAnother looming challenge for NIO is Tesla, which plans to start production in China later this year, allowing the U.S. company to cut prices of its vehicles sold in the country.\n\n\u201cNIO didn\u2019t position itself in the right place,\u201d said Yale Zhang, founder and CEO of AutoForesight. \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic about its future in the long run.\u201d\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Chunying Zhang in Shanghai at czhang714@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at ycho2@bloomberg.net, Will Davies\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.It took Tesla Inc. about 15 years to rack up $5 billion in losses.
