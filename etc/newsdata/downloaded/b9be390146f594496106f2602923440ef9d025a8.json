Mueller pointedly said he was not exonerating Trump of obstructing justice.\n\n\"He's gone rogue.\" \u2013 Speaker Pelosi says about AG Barr on @Morning_Joe. https://t.co/JOdgggn4Ej \u2014 MSNBC (@MSNBC) September 27, 2019\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going rogue,\u201d Pelosi said of the attorney general, although the Justice Department insists he was unaware the Republican president had said he would help investigate a political rival.\n\nSee: \u2018Coverup\u2019 blared from the headlines after release of whistleblower\u2019s complaint against Trump", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi voiced concern on Friday over President Donald Trump\u2019s comments that suggested retaliation against people who helped an...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS222_pelosi_ZG_20190927105500.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
