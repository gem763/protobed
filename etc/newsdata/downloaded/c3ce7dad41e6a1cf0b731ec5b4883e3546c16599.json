Mark Milley told reporters that he has personally ensured Turkey has \u201cexplicit grid coordinate detail\u201d of the location of all 1,000 U.S. troops stationed in Syria.\n\n\u201cWe have been in coordination with them,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is fully aware that we are the United States military. We retain the right of self-defense. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines will defend themselves. That\u2019s clear and it\u2019s unambiguous with anybody.\u201d\n\nMr. Milley\u2019s sharp comments come just hours after Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned that American troops in Syria could still be in danger.\n\nIn a Thursday phone call with Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, Mr. Esper warned of \u201cserious consequences\u201d for Ankara if military action continues. The secretary also said that despite President Trump\u2019s decision to pull American special forces from the area, U.S. personnel could still be in harm\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cSecretary Esper made it clear that the United States opposes Turkey\u2019s uncoordinated actions as they place at risk the progress made by the Defeat-ISIS Coalition,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Jonathan R. Hoffman said in a statement detailing the call. \u201cWhile the secretary reaffirmed we value our strategic bilateral relationship, this incursion risks serious consequences for Turkey. The secretary also reiterated his strong concern that, despite U.S. force protection measures, Turkey\u2019s actions could harm U.S. personnel in Syria.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump announced Sunday that about 50 American special forces would exit a key buffer zone along the Turkey-Syria border. Days later, Turkey launched a military assault against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northern Syria.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces are a key American ally in the fight against the Islamic State, but Turkey considers elements of the group to be terrorists.\n\nU.S. military officials say they\u2019re in close consultation with their Turkish counterparts but that so far there are no indications that Ankara is taking its foot off the gas.\n\n\u201cI have no indication they are willing to stop,\u201d Mr. Esper told reporters Friday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
