I had no income for five years and we had used all our savings.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cAll the benefits stop\u00ad\u00adped and I had absolutely nothing. No husband, no income, nothing. It was such a shock.\n\n\u201cI lived on Universal Credit for six months. It was horrible to be that low.\u201d\n\nSteph said former PM\u2019s wife Cherie, 65, helped out but it was \u201cdifficult having to ask for handouts\u201d.\n\nFour-times wed Tony had often- strained relationships with many of his eight daughters, some of who initially refused to accept his diagnosis.\n\nSteph \u2013 who cared for him alone in Todmorden, West Yorks, almost 200 miles from Cherie in Buckinghamshire \u2013 had a daily battle for funding.\n\nShe often had to fork out for expenses not covered by Tony\u2019s care plan. She said: \u201cI wanted to give him a quality of life while he could still enjoy it.\n\n\u201cThese packages don\u2019t take into account the needs of the human being. Instead it\u2019s a one-size-fits-all approach.\u201d\n\n(Image: Chris Bull)\n\n(Image: Rex)\n\nShe added that a lack of support for carers was increasing the misery of hundreds of thousands who have a relative with the disease.\n\nShe said: \u201cWhen he was diagnosed I was told to just take him home and look after him.\n\n\u201cThere are at least 800,000 people with dementia in this country.\n\n\u201cTying to find what you\u2019re entitled to is a nightmare.\n\n\u201cThis disease is already causing untold misery for these people but this is added to by the bureaucracy of the system which denies people help.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be like that when looking after someone so ill. The system leaves you bitter and resentful from the lack of understanding.\u201d", "description": "Steph Booth, 64, was married to Tony Booth, from Till Death Us Do Part, for 23 years until his death at 85 in 2017", "authors": ["Amy Coles", "Image", "Pa", "Chris Bull", "Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650402.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Prime-Ministers-wife-Cherie-Blair-2009.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
