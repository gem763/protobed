However, Libra differs from many cryptocurrencies as it is centralised in its nature against the founding member companies, in a similar way that fiat currencies are centralised against a central bank,\u201d Ana Bencic, president of digital exchange Nexthash, told The Independent.\n\n\u201cDue to the ... circle of multi-billion dollar companies essentially managing their own currency, it is not surprising that central banks are cautious of money moving in this direction. It will be interesting to see the result of these talks and whether governments or Libra will make any adjustments to accommodate it within the online global economy.\u201d\n\nThe meeting in Basel, Switzerland, will involve representatives from the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve, according to officials who spoke with the Financial Times.\n\nFacebook previously said that it welcomes feedback from global regulators, claiming that it announced Libra long before its intended release date in order to address any potential issues.\n\n\u201cIn the nearly three months since the intent to launch the Libra project was announced, we have become the world\u2019s most scrutinised fintech effort,\u201d a spokesperson for Libra told The Independent last week.\n\n\u201cWe welcome this scrutiny and have deliberately designed a long launch runway to have these conversations, educate stakeholders and incorporate their feedback in our design.\u201d", "description": "Facebook faces further scrutiny over its plans to launch its own currency, with representatives of the tech giant set to meet with global regulators on Monday.
