REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest yoghurt maker said cool weather in August had hit sales of water in Europe, while yoghurt sales were weak in the United States and Russia, taking the shine off strong baby food sales in China.\n\n\u201cWe close the third quarter somewhere below where we wanted to be,\u201d Chief Finance Officer Cecile Cabanis told analysts, adding: \u201cWe do not control the weather.\u201d\n\nShe expressed confidence that Danone\u2019s sales would accelerate in the fourth quarter with strong growth expected in baby food in China along with a further expansion in sales of its plant-based business that makes products such as soya yoghurt. She said water sales would improve in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter\u2019s performance.\n\nDanone is now aiming for 2019 group like-for-like sales growth of 2.5%-3% against a previous forecast of around 3%.\n\nThe company still expects an operating margin above 15% for 2019, putting it on track for its 2020 goals of an operating margin of above 16% and like-for-like sales growth of 4-5%, Cabanis said.\n\nBy 0854 GMT Danone shares were down 7.8% at 72.42 euros.\n\nJefferies analysts said: \u201cQ3 like-for-like has missed materially and FY 2019 top line guidance has been trimmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHitting the lower end of sales guidance implies like-for-like growth of 3.7% in Q4, relative to consensus 4.5%.\u201d\n\nDanone, whose yoghurt brands include Actimel and Activia, had third-quarter sales of 6.418 billion euros ($7.1 billion).\n\nThis marked a like-for-like rise of 3.0% that was below analysts\u2019 expectations for 3.8% growth, but was an acceleration from 2.5% growth in the second quarter.\n\nSTRONG CHINA PERFORMANCE\n\nChina contributes about 30% of sales to the Danone\u2019s Early Life Nutrition business, which makes infant formula and general baby food products.\n\nThis division\u2019s sales in China returned to growth in the second quarter after a slump in the first quarter partly due to lower birth rates. Growth accelerated further in the third quarter to more than 20%, marking the highest ever quarter in terms of net sales.\n\nSales in China were helped by a focus on more premium products, an expansion towards cities where Danone has a bigger presence, and an increase of sales via E-commerce.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Yoghurt by French foods group Danone in Nice, France, January 16, 2017.
