Earlier this month, Sen. Kamala Harris called on Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump for tweets that specifically targeted a whistle-blower, in what Harris claimed was a violation of Twitter\u2019s terms of service. Twitter did not suspend Trump\u2014nor will it take action against other world leaders, according to a new company blog post. Instead, if Twitter decides a politician\u2019s tweet broke the rules, it will leave it on the site, accompanied by a disclaimer.\n\n\u201cIf a Tweet from a world leader does violate the Twitter Rules but there is a clear public interest value to keeping the Tweet on the service, we may place it behind a notice that provides context about the violation and allows people to click through should they wish to see the content,\u201d Twitter\u2019s announcement reads.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kelly Weill", "Thedailybeast.Com Twitter-Details-Policy-That-Allows-Political-Figures-To-Break-Its-Rules"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
