And the junior from suburban Columbus got leaner and meaner, taking more than 30 pounds off his 6-foot-9 frame and building muscle. He\u2019s down to 255 and says he has more flexibility and stamina than ever.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s two different people,\u201d he said of the before and after.\n\nHis older brother Andre, the only scholarship senior for the No. 18 Buckeyes, certainly sees it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely been moving better, jumping better,\u201d Andre Wesson said. \u201cHis body has definitely changed.\u201d\n\nThe Buckeyes, ranked 18th in the preseason AP Top 25 poll, are going to need the experience and maturity provided by the brothers Wesson. Some of third-year coach Chris Holtmann\u2019s most talented players will be freshmen this season, and the team\u2019s fortunes likely will depend how quickly they can be coached up.\n\nThey include a trio of four-star prospects, including point guard D.J. Carton, who could be one of the best Ohio State players to come along in years.\n\nStill, all the youth on the roster makes Holtmann a little anxious, especially after having to utilize true freshmen guards Luther Muhammed and Duane Washington Jr. in 34 and 35 games, respectively, last season.\n\n\u201cOld wins in college basketball,\u201d Holtmann said. \u201cMature talent wins in college basketball. By mature I\u2019m not saying necessarily age because that\u2019s not always the case. Mature talent wins consistently at the highest level of college basketball, so it\u2019s our job to get our group mature as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s no question the Buckeyes will have more talent than last season.\n\nWHERE ARE THE POINTS?\n\nKaleb Wesson was the team\u2019s leading scorer last season, averaging 14.6 points but also frequently getting into foul trouble and showing frustration at getting double-teamed by opponents that knew slowing him down was the key to beating the Buckeyes. As far as returning scorers, Andre Wesson was next at 8.6 points, with Muhammad and Washington averaging 7.6 and 7 points, respectively.\n\n\u201cI think you could look at their growth as important as anything with our team right now,\u201d Holtmann said of that sophomore pair. \u201cAre they going to learn from their freshman year where they had some really good moments and moments where they struggled?\u201d\n\nMEET THE NEW GUYS\n\nBesides Carton, four-star freshmen E.J. Liddell and Alonzo Gaffney will need to play significant roles, Liddell, a 6-foot-6 forward, was a two-time Mr. Basketball in Illinois. Gaffney, a 6-foot-9 Cleveland native, turned down scores of offers from other big schools to play at Ohio State. At 6-foot-10 and 220 pounds, Ibrahima Diallo will be another much-needed big man inside. A native of Senegal, he played prep school basketball in California. Carton and CJ Walker, who sat out last season after transferring from Florida State, will be the point guards.\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE?\n\nGuards C.J. Jackson and Keyshawn Woods moved on.\n\nWHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?\n\nHoltmann patched together undersized lineups all last season, especially after losing forward Kyle Young to a leg injury. That left Kaleb Wesson as the only true post player on the roster, and it showed as the Buckeyes dropped five in a row and six of their first seven conference games after the calendar flipped over to 2019. They finished 20-15 (8-12 in the Big Ten), won a game in the conference tournament and another in the NCAA Tournament before being flattened by Houston in the round of 32. Young is healthy now and expected to play a big role.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nGuard Musa Jallow is out indefinitely after arthroscopic surgery on his right ankle. Carton sprained his ankle in a scrimmage but is expected to be OK.\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nThe Buckeyes open Nov. 6 at home against Cincinnati. The first big test will be against No. 10 Villanova on Nov. 13. And they\u2019ll be challenged in December with matchups against No. 9 North Carolina, Penn State, Minnesota and No. 2 Kentucky.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/MarchMadness and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Mitch Stacy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mitchstacy\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After a disappointing rollercoaster of a season, Ohio State's gifted big man, Kaleb Wesson, explored the possibility of leaving school early for the NBA.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mitch Stacy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/ohio_st_preview_basketball_10578_c0-301-5722-3638_s1200x700.jpg?459d2e8b01b5c06f380697b29de1cb3667009390", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
