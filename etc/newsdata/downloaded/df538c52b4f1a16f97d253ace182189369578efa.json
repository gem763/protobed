Good Days agreed to pay $2 million while PAN Foundation agreed to pay $4 million. Neither admitted wrongdoing.\n\nGood Days in a statement said the settlement will allow it to concentrate on providing help to people in need of life-saving medications. PAN said the settlement involved \u201clegacy matters\u201d rather than its current operations.\n\nDrug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in the government\u2019s Medicare healthcare program for those aged 65 and older. Companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent.\n\nBut the government has alleged that various drugmakers have used charities like Good Days and PAN as means to improperly pay the co-pay obligations of Medicare patients using their drugs, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.\n\nThe department said Good Days, previously known as the Chronic Disease Fund, from 2010 to 2014 conspired with companies including Novartis AG, Astellas and Questcor, now owned by Mallinckrodt Plc , to pay kickbacks to Medicare patients.\n\nPAN similarly permitted four companies including Bayer AG , Astellas, Dendreon Pharmaceuticals and Amgen Inc to use it as a conduit to pay patients kickbacks, the government alleged.\n\nAstellas and Amgen in April agreed to pay $100 million and $24.75 million, respectively, to resolve related claims. Mallinckrodt is fighting a lawsuit by the Justice Department over its donations to Good Days and denies wrongdoing.\n\nRepresentatives for the other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.", "description": "Two charities will pay $6 million to resolve claims they operated as pass-throughs for seven pharmaceutical companies to pay kickbacks to Medicare patients using their high-priced medications, the U.S. Justice Department said on Friday.", "authors": ["Nate Raymond", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
