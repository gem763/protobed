Meanwhile, others, including NYT, AP, and Politico, buried that point in the middle of the article.\n\nBefore resigning from his position at State last week, McKinley had worked as a diplomat for more than 35 years, serving as an American ambassador to Afghanistan, Colombia, Peru, and Brazil.\n\nAlthough his testimony on Wednesday lasted more than five hours, it was shorter when compared to the depositions of other impeachment inquiry witnesses.\n\nCiting an official involved in the investigation, NYT reported that McKinley appeared for a deposition voluntarily, adding that House Democrats did not issue a subpoena.\n\nMcKinley testified that he was \u201cdisturbed\u2019 by claims that Trump urged foreign governments to investigate his political rivals.\n\nOne of his former colleagues released excerpts of his testimony to the press, National Public Radio (NPR) acknowledged. McKinley testified:\n\nI was disturbed by the implication that foreign governments were being approached to procure negative information on political opponents. I was convinced that this would also have a serious impact on foreign service morale and the integrity of our work overseas.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have called on House Democrats pursuing the impeachment probe to release the transcripts of depositions, to no avail. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), the leader of the impeachment investigation, has pledged to release all the transcripts but refused to say when.\n\nSo far, House Democrats have conducted all depositions in private.\n\nGOP lawmakers have also blasted Democrats for cherry-picking evidence and releasing bits and pieces of testimony that fit their impeachment narrative.\n\nMcKinley reportedly told lawmakers he quit his position over frustration with Pompeo\u2019s refusal to defend career diplomats, particularly former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nThe Trump administration removed Yovanovitch from her ambassador position. She serves as a State Department fellow at Georgetown University.\n\nMcKinley said:\n\nSince I began my career in 1982, I have served my country and every president loyally. Under current circumstances, however, I could no longer look the other way as colleagues are denied the professional support and respect they deserve from us all.\n\nPompeo has pushed back against criticism that he is not standing up for State officials amid the impeachment probe, saying the investigation has incited a \u201csilly gotcha game.\u201d\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), who witnessed McKinley\u2019s testimony, spoke to reporters outside the closed-door deposition room, saying the former State official praised Pompeo.\n\n\u201cI think most of this is a concern by a colleague for an ambassador that he held in high regard,\u201d Meadows reportedly declared. Pompeo listened in on the July 25 call between President Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart that triggered the impeachment probe.", "description": "A former Latin America expert at the State Department with no direct knowledge on Ukraine gave a iclosed door mpeachment probe deposition.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Michael-McKinley-Testifies-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
