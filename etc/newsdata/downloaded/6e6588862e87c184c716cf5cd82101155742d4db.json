(AP/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nJimmy Butler was more than ready for the start of training camp on Tuesday morning.\n\nSo much so, in fact, that Butler showed up to the gym at Keiser University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for the first of the Miami Heat\u2019s training camp two-a-days at 3:30 a.m. \u2014 when the majority of Americans were still sound asleep, and rightfully so.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cJust a little extra work while y\u2019all in your third dream. I like to get it in,\u201d Butler said, via the South Florida Sun Sentinel. \u201cHow did I get in today? I clocked in at 3:30. You\u2019re asleep, right?\u201d\n\nButler signed a four-year, $141 million deal with the Heat this summer in free agency. He said last week that it was the culture surrounding the organization that drew him to South Florida, that he needed it in his life.\n\nClearly he\u2019s embraced that fully, and just couldn\u2019t wait any longer on Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cI just want to compete,\u201d Butler said, via the South Florida Sun Sentinel. \u201cI just want to hoop. All the training is cool, but I want to get out there with my guys, talk a little bit.\n\n\u201cBut more than anything, just compete. I think that\u2019s why we do what we do over the summer. For real, it\u2019s loading up for this. I think today was a good start.\u201d\n\nThe 30-year-old averaged 18.7 points and 5.3 rebounds last season, the majority of which he spent with the Philadelphia 76ers. He\u2019s now undoubtedly one of the most experienced players on Miami\u2019s roster, joining Udonis Haslem and Goran Dragic in leading what is otherwise a fairly young locker room.\n\nWhile it\u2019s still early \u2014 the Heat don\u2019t officially open the season until they host the Memphis Grizzlies on October 23 \u2014 coach Erik Spoelstra said he\u2019s already seen Butler\u2019s incredible drive rubbing off.\n\n\u201cThe thing that also is notable about that is he has a Hall of Fame work ethic,\u201d Spoelstra said, via the South Florida Sun Sentinel. \u201cThat\u2019s not something of myth. That\u2019s something that\u2019s well earned and it\u2019s real. I think he also respects that he\u2019s walking into a gym where there\u2019s several guys that are right there with him, step for step in terms of worth ethic.\n\n\u201cThey may not be coming in at crazy hours like he comes in, but they're putting in time and putting in a lot of extra time.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "While most of the United States was sound asleep, Jimmy Butler was already in the gym on Tuesday morning in South Florida.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/s5Feef1D3NEvcCHiQvxzVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/73Njez4IDu0V011W5TCDjw--~B/aD0zMjgzO3c9NDkyNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/0b7283a0-e4f7-11e9-bbff-ce284999739c"}
