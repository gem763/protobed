The IAAF have tried to pass off their crowd figures by claiming this bizarre trip to the desert will win new hearts and minds, but Neil Black\u2019s team had less flexibility \u2013 a missed target is a missed target.\n\nThey were set a goal of seven to nine medals by UK Sport, as first revealed by Sportsmail in February, and when the music stopped on Sunday, they were on five. In other words, their worst haul since 2005.\n\nAdam Gemili was one of several Team GB stars to narrowly miss out on medals in Qatar\n\nTeam GB also missed out on a medal in the women's 4x400 metre relay after Jamaica's appeal\n\nThe women\u2019s 4x400m relay team finished fourth on the final evening, having initially won an appeal against Jamaica to take bronze, only to then lose a counter-appeal, and later the corresponding men\u2019s quartet botched a switch between Toby Harries and Rabah Yousif, meaning they didn\u2019t finish the final.\n\nIt will put severe pressure on Black, the UK Athletics performance director, at a time when he is already facing serious questions over the 2015 review that cleared Mo Farah to keep working with Alberto Salazar.\n\nThat will be his biggest challenge in forthcoming conversations with the new CEO and chairman at UKA in Zara Hyde Peters and Chris Clark respectively. But the medals will not be the assistance they may have been.\n\nTeam GB ended the World Championships in seventh place after picking up just five medals\n\nBlack said: \u2018There\u2019s a lot to feel really good about. But the reality is the medal tally is not that which we would have wanted.\n\n\u2018It could be better, it should be better. We\u2019ll obviously be talking with UK Sport. Our relationship with UK Sport is really positive. It\u2019s a working together, it\u2019s reviewing, planning, what have we learnt, what are we going to do about it, how do we convert the nearlies into medals.\u2019\n\nThe highs of the Championships from a British perspective are easy to spot \u2013 Dina Asher-Smith stole the show, while Katarina Johnson-Thompson pulled off an incredible result in taking the heptathlon title. When set against the fact there was only one individual medallist at London 2017 \u2013 Farah \u2013 that is progress.\n\nThere were some success stories, led by Dina Asher-Smith and Katerina Johnson-Thompson\n\nDina Asher-Smith was Team GB's shining light with one gold and two silvers on the track\n\nKaterina Johnson-Thompson won gold in the women's heptathlon with a stunning display\n\nBut just as Black pointed to the relays that bailed him out in London \u2013 four medals in two days \u2013 here they managed only two, with silvers in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s.\n\nIn the post-mortem, it ought to be of concern that so many of the athletes touted to step up from London 2017 failed to do so. Black made a play in the aftermath of that home event of the 19 finishes between fourth and eighth and what it signified in terms of potential medallists in waiting. Of them, only Asher-Smith stepped up to medal and, more worryingly, the number of finishers between four and eight in Doha dropped to 11.\n\nThere were good performances that didn\u2019t yield podiums \u2013 Adam Gemili, Holly Bradshaw, Callum, Jake Wightman and Laura Muir among them.\n\nBut athletes seen as fringe contenders such as Andrew Pozzi, Lynsey Sharp, Morgan Lake and two of the relay teams fell well short. So did far too many others.\n\nUK Athletics performance director, Neil Black, won't be smiling after missing medal target\n\nAs a whole you can ask hard questions of where this team stands, with \u00a327m funding for the Olympic cycle and Tokyo 2020 only nine months away. The answers might not be convincing, but for spin they might use the IAAF as an example.\n\nThe international governing body have been saved to extent by strong crowds in the final few days and will point to them as justification of a so-called mission to bring new fans to the sport. But that does not excuse the shambolic sight of empty victory laps for both 100m champions in the early days, nor does it quantify what proportion of the inflated crowds were bussed in spectators on freebies.\n\nDespite the further farce of the marathon runners dropping like flies after midnight in a dangerous climate for distance running, Coe was defiant on Sunday.\n\n\u2018It is pretty clear to us that on athlete performance this is the best world championships that we have ever had,\u2019 he said.\n\nClutching at straws, really. The mistake should not be repeated.", "description": "RIATH AL-SAMARRAI IN DOHA: While Seb Coe was scratching around for for ways to sell these World Championships as a success, the folk leading the British team couldn't spin the same yarn.", "authors": ["Riath Al-Samarrai For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/21/19370332-0-image-a-7_1570393718658.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
