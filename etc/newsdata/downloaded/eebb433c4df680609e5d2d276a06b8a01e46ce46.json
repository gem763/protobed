Read more\n\nShortly before 10pm on a Friday, Newton bounces around her kitchen, steaming kale and packing take-out boxes into a tote bag. Newton is working for herself in a business she created called Meals 4 Heels, a one-of-a-kind food service that delivers fresh, nutritious bowls to sex workers and strippers during late-night hours.\n\nAfter 13 years of living in Portland and hustling in food service, Newton launched Meals 4 Heels in January. Her ex-girlfriend is a stripper and she has several friends who work in the industry. She quickly noticed that no one was looking out for their basic health needs \u2013 like sustenance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re known for our food carts and strip clubs, but yet the human aspect is missing,\u201d said Newton. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense why there hasn\u2019t been something like this.\u201d\n\nBetter eating is just a part of a wider discussion on wellness and labor rights and conditions taking place in some of the country\u2019s strip clubs. Just as in more conventional workspaces, there is now a debate over workers\u2019 rights, the complex pros and cons of contract work and a struggle to wrest better terms from employers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cha Cha plus chicken sausage, a dish produced by Meals 4 Heels.

According to research by Priceonomics, the city boasts 54 and has more than twice as many strip clubs as it has public restrooms. That is largely because Oregon\u2019s constitution protects \u201cobscenity\u201d under the first amendment. Moreover, zoning laws state that businesses cannot be denied locations based on their sexual content or nature.\n\nYet despite their numbers, strippers and sex workers are rarely free from disparagement \u2013 in many instances their industry is the first to face harassment and the last to be protected.\n\nFor Newton, Meals 4 Heels is her way of putting a diverse and caring face on Portland\u2019s sex industry, while nourishing its workers.\n\nFrom an online menu, clients can choose from several south-western and Mediterranean-inspired bowls, like the GTP ($Gettin That Paper$), a gluten-free and vegan dish that includes roasted cauliflower and sweet potato noodles; or the Freegan Vegan, piled with roasted yams, apples, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and brown rice. Almost all ingredients are organic and locally sourced.\n\n\u201cThe menu is curated for dancers,\u201d said Newton. \u201cNo legumes, low on nightshades, low garlic, onions and acids, so they\u2019re not gassy or breathing garlic. I keep that in mind.\u201d\n\nNewton does all the prepping and cooking herself and delivers to about 20 clubs. She\u2019s also running a GoFundMe campaign to help cover costs and wants Meals 4 Heels to be recognized as a business of color in America\u2019s whitest city.\n\nAt Riverside Corral, a strip club in Portland\u2019s south-east neighborhood, a dancer who uses the stage name Plum ordered the Verbal Tipper, which comes with lemon pepper couscous, massaged kale, pickled veggies and marinated artichokes.\n\nWhat she likes most about Meals 4 Heels, said Plum, is \u201cthe delivery, number one. And it\u2019s so nice to have food that\u2019s healthy that\u2019s not going to make me fart or shit my pants. And it\u2019s just made with love.\u201d\n\nJulie Flores, a stripper at Club Rogue, said her favorite was the Cha Cha Cha, which blends brown rice, citrus slaw, black olives, avocado and tortilla chips.\n\nSexual revolution: the underseen art and activism of queer sex work Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a really good, clean option for us,\u201d said Flores. \u201cWhere I work, we just have fried shit, like wings. So [Meals 4 Heels] provides wholesome meals that fuel our bodies, because every time I come home I feel like I just did a workout.\u201d\n\nLate-night employees would be hard pressed to find food options that are open at 2am and not teeming with trans fats and cholesterol.\n\nBut a healthy diet is just one of the issues facing Portland\u2019s sex workers and strippers.\n\nMatilda Bickers, a former stripper, and Amy Pitts, another dancer, sued Portland\u2019s Casa Diablo strip club in 2015, citing unpaid wages and harassment, on the part of the customers and employees. They settled out of court.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A strip club in Portland, Oregon, which has more strip clubs per capita than any other US city.

One of her most publicized platforms is lobbying for strippers to be classified as employees in Oregon.\n\nMost strippers in the US are deemed independent contractors. They\u2019re paid in tips, rather than an hourly wage or salary.\n\n\u201cMany of them prefer the freedom to schedule their own shifts, wear whatever they want, do the job in the way they want, work for competitors even,\u201d said the labor lawyer Rich Meneghello. \u201cNow if they became employees, a lot of that freedom goes away.\u201d\n\nBut freedom also means contractors don\u2019t pay into social security or Medicare, are not eligible for sick leave, overtime or unemployment benefits and are not protected in the same way as employees from workplace harassment.\n\nIn addition, as contractors, strippers essentially have to pay to work, through what are called stage or house fees. They can range anywhere from five dollars to well over a hundred. It\u2019s a \u201cpay for the pole\u201d policy that is typically meant to cover expenses like advertising and club maintenance.\n\nIf they\u2019re late to a shift, get sick or don\u2019t make enough in a night to pay those fees, the stripper then owes \u201cback rent\u201d to the club.\n\nIn January this year, a Democratic state senator, Kathleen Taylor, introduced a bill that would have classified strippers as employees. The bill was eventually laid to rest, marking the third attempt to get this type of legislation passed.\n\nAccording to a study by Portland State University, because Portland strippers don\u2019t require a permit, can perform fully nude, allow clients to touch them with consent during private dances, and, as contractors, lack protection from workplace agencies, \u201cthe research suggests that exotic dancers are at risk of experiencing various forms of violence while at work with limited resources to turn to for help\u201d.\n\nOf 33 strippers who participated in the study, 32 reported experiencing some form of violence while at work, while 84% reported they had experienced \u201cunwanted groping, rape, forced or coerced unwanted sexual acts\u201d.\n\nElle Stanger, who dances at Portland\u2019s Lucky Devil Lounge, is fiercely committed to maintaining her independent contractor status. She makes good money, has control over her performances and schedule, and keeps all her earnings from private dances.\n\nBut she recognizes that her club is not all clubs, which means there\u2019s no silver bullet solution.\n\n\u201cI just want to caution people to be wary of a quick fix approach to labor problems, when the issues tend to be so different in some cases,\u201d said Stanger.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Elle Stanger has been co-organizing the Portland Slutwalk since 2014. It\u2019s a demonstration against sexual violence and victim-blaming.

At first sight, it sounds good.\n\nBut Stanger, who co-hosts the sex worker industry podcast Strange Bedfellows, has been asking for feedback from strippers in California who have recently become employees. According to Stanger, the majority say the bill is damaging to their industry, claiming lower earnings and fewer bookings.\n\nStanger foresees clubs forced to fire dancers, simply because they won\u2019t be able to afford their wages.\n\n\u201cI heard from dancers who said: \u2018I was deemed too fat for my club.\u2019 Or due to racist management practices, they cut a lot of dancers of color,\u201d said Stanger.\n\nAaliyah Topps, who danced in Seattle, said she believed club managers and owners favored Caucasian strippers. \u201cI know multiple girls who aren\u2019t allowed back to the club due to back rent and most of these are women of color. They don\u2019t advertise women of color on any flyers, posters or websites,\u201d she said.\n\nTopps is part of a coalition called Strippers Are Workers, which formed in the summer of 2018 through the not-for-profit Working Washington. It was co-founded by the dancer Angelique, who declined to offer her last name. She works at one of the only clubs in Seattle that is not owned by D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, which runs roughly 132 strip clubs in 41 states. It owns 11 of Washington\u2019s 14 strip clubs.\n\n\u201cMore and more customers were becoming aggressive, they were starting to not pay for services,\u201d said Angelique of why she started the coalition. \u201c[The clubs] were treating us like employees in terms of scheduling us, having control over our work and setting our prices, which is illegal.\u201d\n\nThe coalition took its complaints to the Washington legislature last October. Topps, who stripped at D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, testified about the lack of running water at the club, having to use a portable toilet as a restroom, harassment from management, and the $140 to $200 stage fees the dancers had to pay the club per night, which can quickly become back rent.\n\nThis May, Strippers Are Workers succeeded in getting House Bill 1756 passed. It\u2019s a landslide piece of legislation for the sex worker industry that requires Washington strip clubs to install panic buttons in VIP rooms; offers a Know Your Rights training for dancers who apply for a business license; creates a record and \u201cblacklist\u201d of violent customers; and establishes an advisory committee to help implement and enforce the bill.\n\nMake yourselves at home: the meaning of hospitality in a divided world Read more\n\nThe efforts in Washington echo another reform movement in Minneapolis. In August, its city council unanimously voted in a new ordinance that mandates adult entertainment workers receive a copy of their contracts, prohibits retaliation against those who report violations and requires businesses to post customer conduct and workers\u2019 rights information.\n\nBack in Portland, Nikeisah Newton knows the importance of lifting up those who are sidelined \u2013 as a gay, black woman working for the sex worker industry: \u201cIt\u2019s all about marginalized groups. We\u2019ve got to take care of each other.\u201d", "description": "Meals 4 Heels is offering healthy late-night takeout for sex workers and strippers, and it\u2019s just part of a discussion on wellness and working conditions in the industry", "authors": ["Melanie Sevcenko"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07778749811d7418adb054b80a2058b0efe9f846/40_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=de6f51dd0112981974d93233462946d6", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
