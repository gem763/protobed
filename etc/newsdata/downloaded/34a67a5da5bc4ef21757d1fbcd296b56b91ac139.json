His wife, Susan L. Oberg, posted to his Instagram that the actor was recovering from some sort of incident, but she did not go into detail about what happened. Days later, she posted an update that he was \u201cwinning the fight\u201d but made the announcement today that he\u2019d died on Saturday. \u201cMy light, my heart, my true love, my King, the other half of my soul, Sidney, passed from this realm on to the next,\u201d Oberg wrote in the photo caption. \u201cHe has returned to the Universe, a shining star in her heavens. He was my angel, my husband, my best friend and always will be. He adored his family, his friends, and his fans. This came as a shock to all of us.\u201d She concluded by saying, \u201cGoodnight, my love. We will find each other again, next time. I love you.\u201d\n\nHaig started acting in the 1960s, appearing on various television shows and in films like Blood Bath and the science-fiction classic THX 1138. His most high-profile role came after he started collaborating with Rob Zombie, taking the role of the mad clown Captain Spaulding in House of 1,000 Corpses, a defining entry in the hardcore-horror era of the 2000s. He reprised that role in the sequel, The Devil\u2019s Rejects, and was meant to play a starring role in Zombie\u2019s final film in the trilogy, 3 From Hell, but his health prevented him from being able to participate beyond a cameo role.\n\nZombie said of Haig\u2019s condition around the time of that film\u2019s production, \u201cThe movie that I prepped to make, and was getting ready to start shooting, it was Captain Spaulding, Otis, and Baby, the three originals,\u201d the director explained. \u201cBut three weeks out from shooting, I got a call from Sid Haig. He had been in the hospital, and he had just had surgery, and he was now recovering in a rehabilitation facility. I\u2019m like, holy shit, this is a serious business. So I went to see him, and he had changed drastically from the last time I saw him. Because Sid, he\u2019s big and burly, and now he\u2019s tiny as a skeleton. So I was like, oh man. I kind of realized, yeah, he\u2019s in rough shape.\u201d\n\nHaig was beloved in the horror community and a familiar presence on the festival and convention circuit. He was 80 years old.\n\nAwww so sad about Sid Haig. From Spider Baby to Captain Spaulding he created a strong iconic presence in all his roles. In person he was warm and kind and all will remember how devoted he was to his fans. Too soon gone but so bold and brilliant we will never forget. #Rip \u2014 Barbara Crampton (@barbaracrampton) September 23, 2019\n\nVery sad to hear about Sid Haig\u2019s passing.

An enthralling storyteller. A class act. One of a kind. An historical landmark that will missed forever. pic.twitter.com/1YSYbE1p69 \u2014 Tom Savini (@THETomSavini) September 23, 2019\n\nLet history record that just last month Sid Haig showed up for the Scares That Care charity event, flying cross country and taking care of his fans even when he was having trouble walking. He loved the horror family as much as horror loved him.@Shudder @kinky_horror pic.twitter.com/ghgro55VcY \u2014 Joe Bob Briggs (@therealjoebob) September 23, 2019", "description": "Sid Haig, a favorite actor of Rob Zombie who starred in films like House of 1,000 Corpses and The Devil\u2019s Rejects, is dead at 80 years old.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/23/23-sid-haig.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
