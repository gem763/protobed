What was particularly supportive of a dovish Fed is that there was no wage growth. Zero wage growth means no inflation and that means that rates can be cut without fear of fanning inflationary pressures.\n\nAlso, this morning both President Trump and Larry Kudlow have hinted at the possibility of positive surprises in next week's negotiations with China. Talks commence on Monday and Tuesday at the staff level with the principal parties scheduled to meet on Thursday and Friday.\n\nAt this point, the market is largely held hostage to the news flow that emerges from these talks next week. It makes for very difficult trading since there really is no way to know what might hit or to even know when we can expect some news. The bears would love to press their bets but the potential for a big spike on some positive developments carries too much risk. The bulls are equally handcuffed because the reaction will be swift and ugly if negotiations fall apart as they have in the past.\n\nTo add to the complexity we still have problematic technical conditions. Many of the badly broken stocks that bounced earlier this week are starting to roll over again. I see weakness in the recent IPOs, biotechnology, and some other groups as well. Strength in Apple (AAPL) is helping to offset the relative weakness in small caps. Breadth is running about 4-3 positive which reflects more mixed action indicated by the DJIA.\n\nThe indices are squeezing the bears that are focused on market direction but the bulls that are trying to do some individual stock picking are having a very hard time finding pockets of positive momentum to trade.\n\nI've made a few minor moves while I continue to look for better technical action but there just isn't much there. I see no reason to be in any rush to build positions.\n\n(Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club. Want to be alerted before Jim Cramer buys or sells AAPL?
