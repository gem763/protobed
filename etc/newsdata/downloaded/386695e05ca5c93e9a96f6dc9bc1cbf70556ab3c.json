Uyghur-Americans, however, must weigh their desire to speak freely with the potential torture and murder of their loved ones in Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cUyghurs outside of China are also subject to extraterritorial surveillance and coercion,\u201d Turkel noted. \u201cOur latest report on this issue documents these ongoing and flagrant violations of federal law on U.S. soil. They are telling us, \u2018We are watching you. Wherever you go, still you are a Chinese.'\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though you are outside of China, [that] doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t do something to you because they have your friends, children, parents, and relatives,\u201d he noted. \u201cAgents of [a] foreign power are surveilling and terrorizing our own fellow American citizens with threats to send their remaining family members to the camps if they speak out about what is happening in their homeland.\u201d\n\nAsked by commission member Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) to describe his personal experience, Turkel said he does not expect to ever see his parents again and that China may kill them to punish him for appearing before Congress.\n\n.@nuryturkel, Chair of the Board for the @uyghurproject, during this morning's @CECCgov hearing: \"Even testifying at this hearing may cost the lives of my parents, but you know, it\u2019s the right thing to do\u2026because speaking for the voiceless people is very empowering.\" pic.twitter.com/gdFv0z21uN \u2014 Senator Rubio Press (@SenRubioPress) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cTwo things I thought that I was over with when I arrived in the United States and became a U.S. citizen: one, that I would never talk about my past history of being born in a reeducation camp; some 40 some odd years later, we are talking about similar circumstances,\u201d Terkel responded. \u201cTwo, that I should be able to speak my mind. That is not happening to its full extent\u201d:\n\nThe last time I saw my mother was when she was here in 2004 for my law school graduation \u2026 My father is 80 years old, mom is 68, I don\u2019t think that I will ever see them again unless China\u2019s government allows them to spend the rest of their lives here with their three American citizen grandchildren. It\u2019s been difficult. It would be disingenuous to say that I have a normal life. I don\u2019t. I would like to go back to what my life was two years ago \u2026 At least I was able to check up on my family members \u2026 because of this software that the Chinese government forced Uyghurs to install on their phones, the Uyghurs have been disconnected. Even testifying at this hearing may cost the lives of my parents. But, you know, it\u2019s the right thing to do. I have to speak out. It helps me to overcome the sense of anxiety, sense of guilt, sense of desperation, despair, because speaking as a voice for the people is very empowering.\n\nRubio responded by noting that every American company doing business with China is complicit in the harassment of U.S. citizens like Turkel and the widespread human rights abuses in China \u201cbecause your partner [in business] is the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\n\nRubio used the recent controversy surrounding the NBA\u2019s silencing of Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey for his support for Hong Kong protesters as an example of the corrosive impact Chinese communism has on American businesses. The NBA currently hosts a \u201ctraining camp\u201d in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang.\n\nSeveral others at the hearing provided examples of how China\u2019s human rights atrocities affect America and Americans on a routine basis. Congressman Thomas Suozzi (D-NY) recalled the story of Dan Zhong, convicted in March of enslaving Chinese workers in Brooklyn.\n\n\u201cA jury in Brooklyn convicted the head of a Chinese construction firm for engaging in a conspiracy to provide forced labor of Chinese laborers here in the United States of America,\u201d he noted. \u201cPeople were working 14 hours a day, seven days a week, without receiving pay \u2026 right here, in Brooklyn!\u201d\n\nZhong previously worked as a diplomat for the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nAdrian Zenz, a non-resident senior fellow in China Studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, testified to the commission that the Xinjiang concentration camps include facilities used for slave labor and that China provides significant subsidies to Chinese companies to engage in slave labor in the region.\n\nChina is \u201cturning its internment campaign into a business of oppression \u2026 they will be able to undercut global prices and turn \u2018Made in Xinjiang\u2019 into a multi-billion-dollar business model,\u201d Zenz warned.\n\nBoth Turkel and Zenz noted the example of Hetian Taida, a Chinese corporation that the U.S. government recently banned from importing goods into the country, as many of its goods are believed to be made by Uyghur, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz slaves.\n\n\u201cHetian Taida shipped 1.2 million items of baby pajamas and baby sleeper blankets with the destination of Costco, and Costco was going to sell it on their website,\u201d Zenz told Congress, noting that China produces a fourth of the world\u2019s cotton, and Xinjiang produces 84 percent of that.\n\n\u201cIt extremely disturbing that U.S. companies were still sourcing from the company,\u201d Turkel said of Hetian Taida. \u201cTwo weeks ago, baby clothes produced by Hetian Taida were on the shelves at Costco. \u2026 It\u2019s hard to understand how the goods got on the shelves in the first place.\u201d\n\nTurkel urged Congress to help \u201cend the unwitting complicity of the American public\u201d in enslaving the people of Xinjiang by limiting the import of Chinese products, because, \u201cgiven this system of intimidation and terror both inside and outside of China, corporate supply chain due diligence is impossible.\u201d\n\nReports of the reality of the Xinjiang concentration camps are few and far between, and mostly come for Kazakhs and Kyrgyz people whose relatives managed to levy their ethnic identity to get nations like Kazakhstan to get them out. Sayragul Sautbay, a Kazakh woman who escaped slavery in a Xinjiang concentration camp, told Haaretz in a story published Thursday that she was forced to teach Mandarin, which is the only language Beijing recognizes as authentic \u201cChinese,\u201d and regularly saw inmates beaten, tortured, bloodied, used for medical experiments, and raped.\n\nOn one occasion, she told the newspaper, she and about 200 others were forced to witness a gang rape by police, and those who winced or seemed uncomfortable were punished with torture:\n\nOne day, the police told us they were going to check to see whether our reeducation was succeeding, whether we were developing properly. They took 200 inmates outside, men and women, and told one of the women to confess her sins. She stood before us and declared that she had been a bad person, but now that she had learned Chinese she had become a better person. When she was done speaking, the policemen ordered her to disrobe and simply raped her one after the other, in front of everyone. While they were raping her they checked to see how we were reacting. People who turned their head or closed their eyes, and those who looked angry or shocked, were taken away and we never saw them again. It was awful. I will never forget the feeling of helplessness, of not being able to help her. After that happened, it was hard for me to sleep at night.\n\nOther women who have escaped say they have been subject to forced sterilization, forced abortions after multiple rapes, and had their organs screened for viability as an unwilling donor. Survivors say that young men were also raped and sterilized.\n\nChina claims the camps are \u201cvocational training centers\u201d for people vulnerable to becoming jihadists and calls all survivors of the camps liars.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Uyghur-Americans face regular threats from the Chinese Communist Party on U.S. soil, Nury Turkel, a Uyghur-American attorney, told Congress.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Nury-Turkel-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
