(Brendan McDermid/Reuters)\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) announced on Sunday that the whistleblower at the center of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump may not testify before Congress due to concerns over the person\u2019s safety.\n\n\u201cOur primary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected,\u201d Schiff told interviewers on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation.\n\nSchiff explained that Democrats may be able to gather enough evidence to impeach Trump without revealing the person\u2019s identity.\n\nTrump blasted Schiff\u2019s comments on Twitter on Monday morning .\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff now doesn\u2019t seem to want the Whistleblower to testify. NO!\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWe must determine the Whistleblower\u2019s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly called on House Democrats to reveal the identity of the whistleblower. \u201cI do not know why a person that defrauds at the American public should be protected,\u201d the President tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nThe whistleblower initially came forward with concerns about a July phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky based on second hand accounts of the discussion. Trump subsequently released a transcript of the call revealing that he asked Zelensky to investigate corruption allegations against Joe Biden.\n\nDays before the July conversation, Trump delayed a military aid package earmarked by Congress for Ukraine. The timing has caused Democrats to suspect that Trump withheld the aid package to pressure Ukraine to conduct an investigation damaging to his political rival.", "description": "Adam Schiff announced on Sunday that the whistleblower at the center of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump may not testify before Congress.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Rich Lowry", "Jim Geraghty", "Mairead Mcardle", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Andrew C.
