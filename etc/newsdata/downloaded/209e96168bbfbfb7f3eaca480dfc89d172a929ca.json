Benson faces up to life in prison when he is sentenced on Dec. 20.\n\nSampson, who was a popular aide at Fort Hunt Elementary School and a graduate student at George Mason University, had returned home from a night out and was on the phone with his friend Patrick Cuffey when the violence unfolded.\n\nCuffey testified at a January preliminary hearing that he heard Sampson say to someone, \u201cHey, are you good?\u201d Cuffey then heard a single shot. The gunfire was followed by a gurgling sound, but not another word from Sampson.\n\nCuffey eventually called 911, but Sampson was pronounced dead on the scene at the Cityside apartments. He was robbed of personal items.\n\nBlake Woloson, an attorney for Benson, said his client was regretful about what happened.\n\n\u201cHe feels bad about what happened to the young man,\u201d Woloson said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t his intention that anyone get shot. It\u2019s a tragedy for everyone.\u201d\n\nTre\u2019Sur Hawkins, of the District, is slated to stand trial on first-degree murder in the case in November.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Investigators say the victim,Tarreece Sampson, came upon two men breaking into cars and was shot.", "authors": ["Justin Jouvenal", "Reporter Covering Courts", "Policing", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
