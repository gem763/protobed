And today I want to show you something that\u2019s both a superfood and adaptogen\u2014reishi mushroom has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for thousands of years for its dozens of health benefits.\n\nIf you are a regular reader, you are familiar with the term \u201csuperfoods\u201d\u2014nutrient-loaded foods that take the extra step of helping prevent or abate chronic diseases and aging.\n\nAnd you also may remember reading about \u201cadaptogens,\u201d which are foods and supplements that help counter the negative effects of physical, mental and emotional stress.\n\nReishi mushrooms can decrease inflammation, fight anxiety, boost your immune system, help lull you to sleep, heal damage to the liver, and much more. Western medicine has largely ignored the wonders of the reishi mushroom, but right now it\u2019s turning its attention to the mushroom because of its ability to fight prostate cancer.\n\nRead on to learn more about reishi mushrooms and the best ways to incorporate them into your diet.\n\nAn Ancient, Effective Medicine\n\nFor millennia, reishi mushrooms only grew on an extremely small percentage of deciduous trees, making them exceptionally rare and highly sought after. Ancient Chinese writings in the Shennong Benaco Jing (Divine Farmer\u2019s Classic of Pharmaceutics) describe the mushrooms as beneficial to one\u2019s qi (life force) in several areas of the body\u2014liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.\n\nTurns out that those authors weren\u2019t too far off. Now that Western medicine is catching on (a mere 2,000-some years later!), reishi mushrooms are cultivated on hardwood logs and sawdust chips because of their booming popularity around the world.\n\nNumerous studies back the writings in the Shennong Benaco Jing. I\u2019ll get to them in a little bit but first I want to talk about something very unique about the reishi mushroom that even the ancient Chinese didn\u2019t recognize.\n\nI\u2019m talking about prostate health.\n\nReishi Mushrooms and Prostate Health\n\nAmerica\u2019s prostate health is collectively getting worse. According to the American Cancer Society, about one in seven men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. Nearly 3 million men have prostate cancer right now. About six out of ten prostate cancer cases are found in men older than 65 years old. All totaled, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men.\n\nBut there is good news within this. Prostate cancer is very treatable and preventable, and reishi mushrooms can help. Here\u2019s how they work.\n\nIsraeli scientists found that molecules extracted from reishi mushrooms blocked the action of the male sex hormone androgen upon cancerous cells. That\u2019s an important finding because otherwise androgen would stimulate cancerous cells, multiplying the number of them.\n\nPopular drugs for prostate cancer, notably Flutamide, also attempt to interfere with androgen receptions. But reishi extracts do the same thing for far less and with minimal side effects. And, even better, it worked better than Flutamide in the study.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that current studies on reishi mushrooms and prostate cancer are in the preliminary stages. That means that it\u2019s important to wait for additional studies before you hang your hat on reishi as a cure.\n\nBut there are two things about reishi mushrooms that hold a lot of promise.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nFirst, it\u2019s not a medication. It\u2019s a gift from the earth to the medical community. Reported side effects have been generally mild, such as respiratory dryness and itchiness and nosebleed.\n\nSecond, reishi mushrooms already have a wide array of clinically-proven health benefits. And I suspect that additional studies will only increase that number.\n\nHow Reishi Mushrooms Help Your Entire Body\n\nSo don\u2019t take reishi mushrooms just for your prostate health. Take them for your entire health!\n\nReishi mushrooms contain several active healing ingredients that go to work immediately after you consume them.\n\nFor example, triterpenes are acidic substances that can switch off your body\u2019s response to allergies. Polysaccharides prevent formation and development of cancer cells. Plant sterols can prevent absorption of cholesterol into your intestines\u2014thus lowering levels of LDL cholesterol.\n\nDozens of studies conducted separately on three different continents concluded that reishi mushrooms can protect you from an impressive array of diseases and illnesses such as:\n\nDiabetes\n\nFatigue\n\nCommon infections such as urinary tract and bronchitis\n\nLiver disease\n\nInflammation\n\nFlu\n\nAutoimmune disorders\n\nTumor growth and cancer\n\nFood allergies\n\nDigestive problems\n\nStomach ulcers\n\nAsthma\n\nSkin disorders\n\nHeart Disease, hypertension and high cholesterol\n\nSleep disorders\n\nThat\u2019s one powerful mushroom! Again, it\u2019s worth repeating that these conclusions come from separate studies\u2014and those studies show very few and extremely mild side effects.\n\nHow to Incorporate Reishi Mushrooms Into Your Diet\n\nAdding reishi mushrooms to your soups and salads is a great idea. I\u2019m a huge proponent of eating locally sourced, organic and non-GMO food.\n\nThat said, don\u2019t expect to find reishi mushrooms at your local grocery store or farmers market. But you can find them at a lot of online retailers, usually in several forms\u2014many of them organic, non-GMO too.\n\nYou can buy them dried, but they don\u2019t last as long nor do they have the concentrated benefit you can get from concentrated powders, extracts, and supplements.\n\nReishi powder can be added to smoothies, soups, and teas. You may need add a few other ingredients to offset the bitter taste that reishi mushrooms can leave, even as a powder.\n\nMy preference is supplement form. It\u2019s just easier to take and easier to remember to take! Look for a supplement with 6 mg/daily.\n\nIf You are an Older Guy, Consider this Fungi\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that as modern medicine advances, the more it seems to incorporate what was considered cutting-edge practices thousands of years ago. Many of them are natural, effective, and are less likely to produce side effects than lab-developed medicines. Add reishi mushrooms to that lot. Head to toe, they are one of the healthiest things you can eat.\n\nIf you are a man over the age of 50, your chances of getting prostate cancer increase every year. Studies show that reishi mushroom extract can prevent cancerous cells in your prostate from binding and multiplying. And separately, reishi\u2019s anti-inflammatory and immunity superpowers can prevent diseases and illness from taking hold in your body to begin with.\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
