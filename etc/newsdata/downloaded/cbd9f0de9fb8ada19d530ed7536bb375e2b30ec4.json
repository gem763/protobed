NSW Transport Minister Andrew constance speaking to a Committee for Economic Development of Australia event in Sydney about the electrification of the city's bus network. Constance highlights the dangers of pollution on city residents and calls for the industry to electrify the entire fleet. \"Making the switch to an entirely electric bus fleet will deliver hug benefits to our community,\" Constance says. (AAP Video/Michael Wade)\n\nThe NSW Transport Minister wants to clean up Sydney and prevent \u201cscary\u201d levels of air pollution by going electric where possible, including when it comes to the city\u2019s increasingly in-demand buses.\n\nAndrew Constance today also urged the federal government to \u201ccough up a lot\u201d to help fund the city\u2019s new driverless train projects.\n\nThe minister told the Committee for Economic Development of Australia that diesel vehicles were a major contributor to toxic conditions and London had sought to tackle the problem by creating low emission zones and the largest electric bus fleet in Europe.\n\nBus patronage in Sydney has increased by 50 per cent in six years with demand growing faster than for train services.\n\n\u201cWe have to meet these challenges head-on and learn from cities like London and be proactive,\u201d Mr Constance said in Sydney.\n\n\u201cEverything, as much as possible, should be electrified.\u201d\n\nThe minister said some electric buses were already running in Sydney\u2019s inner west, with more to come in Randwick, but almost 8000 diesel buses are in operation across the city.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m challenging the industry to begin an ambitious transformation of our bus fleet from particulate-emitting diesel to zero-emission buses,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf leading European cities can do this so can we.\u201d\n\nThe Berejiklian government announced last week it was privatising Sydney\u2019s remaining state-run bus services although it used the term \u201cfranchising\u201d.\n\nMr Constance said with the construction of new Metro projects the city would go from being a car city to a train city \u201cquite literally overnight\u201d.\n\nHe suggested NSW could build the Metro West project alone but, eventually, federal funds would be needed.\n\n\u201cThere comes a time when we will need our friends in Canberra to make a contribution to Metro trains in the city,\u201d the Liberal MP said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting in billions of dollars worth of infrastructure now around the new western Sydney airport and the feds want that infrastructure open before the airport.\n\n\u201cSo, on that basis, I believe they need to cough up \u2014 and cough up a lot.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Mr Constance denied the Berejiklian government was breaking an election pledge by privatising the remaining state-owned bus routes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not selling the buses, or the depots, we are making sure that they remain the belongings of the people of NSW,\u201d Mr Constance told reporters, adding the government would continue to regulate timetables and Opal fares.\n\nThe government is opening all 13 of Sydney\u2019s metropolitan bus contracts to competitive tender over the next three years, including the remaining three state-run regions \u2014 in the city\u2019s northwest, north shore and northern beaches as well as the eastern suburbs \u2014 by early 2020.\n\nPremier Gladys Berejiklian ruled out more privatisations just days before the state election in March.\n\nNSW Labor leader Jodi McKay says the decision to now privatise the remaining state-run buses is tantamount to a lie.\n\n\u201cThe premier went to the election on a lie,\u201d Ms McKay said in a statement last week.\n\n\u201cShe said no further privatisations and yet here we are, just months after the election, and she is busy selling off our precious public assets.\u201d\n\nThe opposition leader said selling the buses wouldn\u2019t help commuters but would \u201cline the pockets of the private sector\u201d.", "description": "The NSW Transport Minister wants to clean up Sydney and prevent \u201cscary\u201d levels of air pollution by going electric where possible, including when it comes to the city\u2019s increasingly in-demand buses.", "authors": ["Jodie Stephens"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cfabc67a0d5e3e8690d13b1f33f2f3da?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
