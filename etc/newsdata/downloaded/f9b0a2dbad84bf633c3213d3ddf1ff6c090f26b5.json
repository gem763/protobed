Photo: Scott Angelheart/NBC\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know much of anything about a brand-new late-night show only one week into its run, but there are a few suggestive takeaways from the first week of NBC newcomer A Little Late With Lilly Singh. Like almost every late-night show ever launched, it will need some time to settle into itself, but the first week suggests that Singh is charismatic and original enough to pull it off.\n\nThe task of launching a new late-night show is both impossible and straightforward: Singh had to introduce herself to a new audience while also making it seem as though she\u2019d always been there. Hosts need to define what their new show will be, and definitions are tough because the act of defining something always feels like pointing out all the other things it could be, and is trying hard not to be. Starting a new late-night show, especially for a woman of color in a business almost entirely dominated by white men, seems to require a demonstration of effort and self-consciousness \u2014 a bi woman of color, in late night! A person not named Jimmy sitting behind an interview desk! \u2014 while also coming off as unselfconsciously effortless. It is impossible.\n\nSo it\u2019s not surprising that when faced with an impossible task, the first week of Lilly Singh\u2019s A Little Late did have some bumpy moments. The least impressive segments were the ones that felt most directly aimed at introducing Singh to the audience. There was an opening sketch about who Singh is, and the fact that viewers should not change the channel when confronted with a woman sitting behind a late-night desk. There was a bit from an imaginary game of Truth or Dare, where Singh was dared to host her own NBC late-night talk show. There was an old-timey introductory segment where Singh, dressed as a \u201950s sitcom housewife, told her viewers what to expect from the show. \u201cIf you hear something you think is funny, an appropriate response would be to laugh!\u201d Singh says, before adding that it\u2019s less appropriate to slide into her DMs and comment \u201ckinda funny, could be hotter.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to blame Singh and A Little Late for all the overdetermined introduction material. She is different than the usual late-night host, and yes, there will certainly be some viewers who do exactly the things those segments are meant to either prevent or mock. They will fall asleep some time during Seth Meyers\u2019s show, wake up to see a Tamil-Canadian woman hosting a late-night show, make a snort of disapproval, and turn the TV off. Or, just as Singh predicts, they will comment relentlessly on her physical appearance.\n\nMaybe those segments will go some ways toward stopping that reaction. Maybe they will tell new viewers a little about who Singh is, and make them think twice about dismissing her out of hand. But if the intent is to persuade new viewers to seek out Singh\u2019s A Little Late, the less explicitly introductory stuff from Singh\u2019s first week makes a much, much stronger argument for the show.\n\nSingh\u2019s opening monologues do not feel especially practiced, but her story about being afraid of pot and then getting way too high one time was a much better introduction to Singh\u2019s sense of humor than anything you could glean from the stuff meant to tell the audience who she is. It\u2019s a self-deprecating story, the kind of thing that can be a sneakily effective way to communicate self-confidence while also seeming not to. It is closer to the elusive \u201ceffort without seeming effortful\u201d impression that the occasion demands: Singh was awkward, enthusiastic, open, anxious, excited, laughing at herself, laughing at everyone else, and fully in command of the arc of the story. I would happily watch more of that sort of thing than another rap segment where someone gets on a table and rhymes \u201cI know you\u2019re used to only Jimmys in your spotlight / but I\u2019m gonna throw some melanin in your late night.\u201d\n\nEven better and more promising for Singh\u2019s show in the long run is that within the first week she demonstrates that she\u2019s a funny, fast, and magnetic interviewer. Her conversation with Mindy Kaling is great; her interview with Tracee Ellis Ross is perfect. She pushes Ross on the kinds of things that feel human and funny and is absolutely the kind of conversation that\u2019s more likely to happen between two women. Ross gives specifics about how she takes amazing photos of herself while going on solo vacations, and when Singh shares one of her own selfies, it miraculously does not feel like an obvious stunt photo (which is absolutely how it would\u2019ve felt on Fallon or Kimmel). Singh pushes Ross to talk about how she\u2019s tested all of her own hair-care products in the shower. They both come off as hilarious and impressive.\n\nBased on the glimpses of A Little Late that came through during the first week \u2014 the moments that did not have This is the first week of this show! stamped all over them \u2014 A Little Late may have a chance of finally puncturing the Big Three networks\u2019 late-night boys\u2019 club. But there\u2019s one additional thing to watch for the future. In the past year, Fallon\u2019s ratings have dipped while Colbert\u2019s have risen, and that pendulum swing is often attributed (at least partly) to Colbert\u2019s willingness to take on political news that Fallon often avoids. At least for now, Singh appears to be trying to walk a middle ground. In her opening rap she says outright that she will not be talking about Trump, and in the \u201950s housewife segment, she again states that although A Little Late will not be a show about politics, \u201cwe may touch on social issues that are important to me.\u201d\n\nTaking on \u201csocial issues\u201d while declaring politics a no-go zone is a curious and fuzzy line to draw. I understand wanting to make the distinction. \u201cSocial issues,\u201d in this construction, are about daily life, and \u201cpolitics\u201d are the abstract ideas that make everyone mad. Singh may be able to walk that line, bringing up things like abortion access and marijuana legalization without touching the third rail by connecting that thought to \u201cpolitics.\u201d It\u2019s a disingenuous line to draw, though, and it will be curious to watch how it plays out in the long term. For now, A Little Late looks like it could be exactly the sort of thing late night needs: a new voice in a medium that\u2019s long overdue for an overhaul.", "description": "Reviewing the first week of YouTube star Lilly Singh\u2019s new NBC late-night show, \u201cA Little Late With Lilly Singh.\u201d", "authors": ["Kathryn Vanarendonk"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/23/23-lilly-singh-tracee-ellis-ross.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
