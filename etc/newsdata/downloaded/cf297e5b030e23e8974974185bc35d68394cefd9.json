It's Called Trump Towers'", "language": "en", "text": "As even Republican lawmakers and foreign policy experts reel over Donald Trump\u2019s unilateral decision to abandon Kurdish allies to an assault from Turkey in Syria, the president himself apparently has an explanation: \u201cI have a little conflict of interest\u201d concerning Turkey.\n\nTrump made the comment in a Breitbart News interview in December 2015 during his presidential campaign when asked how he would handle Turkey and Syria.\n\n\u201cI have a little conflict of interest \u2019cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul,\u201d Trump boasted in response. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendously successful job. It\u2019s called Trump Towers \u2014 two towers, instead of one, not the usual one; it\u2019s two. And I\u2019ve gotten to know Turkey very well. They\u2019re amazing people, they\u2019re incredible people. They have a strong leader.\u201d\n\nHe said then that the situation was \u201ccomplicated,\u201d adding, \u201cI thrive on complicated.\u201d Trump did not reveal what he would do in the region if he were to become commander in chief.\n\nTrump still owns Trump Towers in Istanbul, and the \u201cstrong leader\u201d then was the same as now: President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThough his continuing business interest in Istanbul is widely known, his own admission that it represents a conflict of interest is startling. Critics have long argued that Trump, as presidents traditionally do, should divest from his businesses to avoid conflicts of interest that threaten to put his personal benefit ahead of the nation\u2019s.\n\nIn a late Sunday phone call with Erdogan, Trump suddenly agreed to let Turkey occupy a strip of northern Syria, currently controlled by ethnic Kurds who have been America\u2019s most effective allies in battling the so-called Islamic State. Now supporters fear a U.S.-enabled slaughter of the Kurds, who have a centuries-long dispute with Turkey over self-rule.\n\n\u201cEveryone was absolutely flabbergasted by this,\u201d retired Adm. James Stavridis said Monday on MSNBC, referring to the Pentagon perspective on Trump\u2019s action. \u201cNobody saw it coming, and that is a real problem when you\u2019re trying to conduct not only foreign policy ... but also military operations. That kind of whipsawing effect is extremely detrimental, not only in this tactical situation but strategically, as our planners try and prepare in other theaters, from North Korea to Afghanistan.\u201d (See the video above at 9:18.)\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Monday that Trump\u2019s decision had nothing to do with the Trump Towers Istanbul complex.\n\nCheck out Trump\u2019s Breitbart interview about his \u201cconflict of interest\u201d below.
