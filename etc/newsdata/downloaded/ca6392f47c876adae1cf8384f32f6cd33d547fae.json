He\u2019s married to Sydel Curry. His brother-in-law is superstar and teammate Stephen Curry.\n\nAnd he\u2019d really like to stop talking about the latter two aspects of his life, rather focusing on the former.\n\nLee is entering his third season of NBA time and his second with the Golden State Warriors, which has meant most of the questions he\u2019s faced are about playing with his famous brother-in-law. After practice on Thursday, Lee, who turns 27 in a matter of days, laid out how he\u2019d like things to go this year.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day my name is Damion Lee. It doesn\u2019t matter who I\u2019m married to.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI want people to respect that for me.

It doesn't matter who I'm married to. I played basketball before I've been married to who I am [married to]. \"I want people to respect that. I work hard for this s\u2014. At the end of the day, I've battled. I've battled. I'm battle-tested. Going through a broken hand, two ACLs. \"I've gone through a lot of s\u2014 during my career to get me to this point. And I don't want anyone in the media to disrespect me, disrespect my family, disrespect the front office here in Golden State for believing in me, for knowing my abilities.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nLee\u2019s journey has taken many turns. After a four-year career at Drexel, during which time he briefly met Sydel, he played a year at Louisville, but sanctions kept the Cardinals from the NCAA Tournament. He went undrafted, was signed and then waived by the Boston Celtics and spent a season in the G League. When he tore his left ACL with the Maine Red Claws, years after injuring his right ACL, he asked to be traded to Santa Cruz, the Warriors G League squad, to be closer to his girlfriend.\n\nHe had two 10-day contracts with the Atlanta Hawks in 2017-18, married Sydel in September 2018 and played for the Warriors on a two-way contract. Per the San Francisco Chronicle, the organization began scouting him in his Drexel days. He\u2019ll play on another two-way contract this season.\n\nSeth Curry, Stephen\u2019s younger brother, also went undrafted and played in the G League, including with the Santa Cruz Warriors. Unlike Seth, who is currently in Portland, Lee was faced with the constant Curry questions since his famous brother-in-law was seats away form him on the same bench.\n\nIt\u2019s an easy, and interesting, narrative in Year 1. But with Year 2 around the corner and the Warriors filling some large shoes, Lee is finished with it.\n\n\"I just want to lay that out on the line right now that going forward this year, there's no family questions. When I'm here in between the lines \u2014 my 9-to-5, this is my job \u2014 I'm thankful, I'm blessed, I'm healthy, I love my family. \"Everyone knows that I don't have any beef with the media, I can answer any question, but at the end of the day there\u2019s no family [questions], there's nothing of that sort because I worked hard to get to the spot that I am.\"\n\nDamion Lee, that seems fair enough.\n\nGolden State Warriors guard Damion Lee is done with the Curry family ties talk.
