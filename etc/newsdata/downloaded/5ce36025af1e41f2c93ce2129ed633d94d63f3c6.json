Beijing says there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\n\nThe comments came after another weekend of mass protest marches that descended into violent clashes between riot police and protesters. To date over 2,000 people have been arrested for taking part in the demonstrations. The government last week enacted emergency legislation for the first time in almost 50 years to crack down on the wearing of face masks at protests and have so far arrested 77 people.\n\nCritics worry that the emergency legislation, which gives Lam unlimited powers, could be used to further crackdown on civil liberties, with authorities already floating the possibility of curfews and internet censorship.\n\nBeijing has been taking a back seat in relation to the protests in Hong Kong so far, fearful that military intervention would further damage the city\u2019s reputation as a financial and commercial hub. However, China\u2019s military is ready to act if necessary.\n\nIn August, China moved thousands of troops into Hong Kong in the dead of night, calling it a routine rotation. But a month later, envoys and security analysts claimed that the move was not a rotation, but a reinforcement, and that Beijing had quietly doubled its troop contingent inside the city-state.\n\nOn Sunday, for the first time in the four-month protest movement, a few hundred people targeted a People\u2019s Liberation Army barracks in the city with laser lights. The protesters dispersed after the military unfurled a banner similar to that used by the police warning the protesters that if they didn\u2019t stop, they would be detained.\n\nREAD: Hong Kong's face mask ban made the protests a whole lot worse\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that the Chinese military will be seen on Hong Kong streets any time soon. Last month, Lam told a group of businesspeople that China had \u201cabsolutely no plan\u201d to deploy People\u2019s Liberation Army troops on Hong Kong streets.\n\n\u201cI don't believe there is widespread anxiety in the community that the PLA is going to be deployed very soon,\u201d Emily Lau, a former pro-democracy lawmaker in Hong Kong, told VICE News. \u201cIt is not something that people are very alarmed and disturbed by it. But people know at the back of their mind that if things get completely out of hand, of course, the Chinese will step in.\u201d\n\nCover: Protesters throw back tear gas at police in Hong Kong, Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019.
