In a statement shared on Twitter, the group said it was \u201cstaunchly opposed to Chick-fil-A setting up shop in the UK and certainly in Reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe chain\u2019s ethos and moral stance goes completely against our values, and that of the UK as we are a progressive country that has legalized same-sex marriage for some years, and continues to strive towards equality,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe group cited infamous comments Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy made in 2012 about believing in the \u201cbiblical definition of the family unit.\u201d It also pointed to the company\u2019s donations to organizations such as the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which says in its statement of faith that marriage is \u201cexclusively the union of one man and one woman.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChick-fil-A has defended its giving, telling Business Insider that the money given to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes funds camps its foundation has hosted through a partnership with the organization.\n\n\u201cThese kids are important to us,\u201d Rodney Bullard, the company\u2019s vice president of corporate social responsibility, told Business Insider. \u201cWe develop relationships with them over the years to where there is a crisis, they actually come to people, in part to people in our staff.\u201d\n\nProtests of the U.K. location continued Saturday even as news spread that the location would close. In videos shared on social media, activists waved rainbow flags and used a microphone to announce that Chick-fil-A is \u201cnot welcome here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou may be closing down six months\u2019 time, but we have a message for you,\u201d one man said. \u201cYou will not be opening anywhere else in the U.K. And if we do see you on our soil, we will stand up and we will challenge you again.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "A spokesperson said the company had always planned to operate the U.K. location for a limited time.", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mLzSM-nmaNn2MM2xCZducLkrA_E=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UD4LSRXSVMI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
