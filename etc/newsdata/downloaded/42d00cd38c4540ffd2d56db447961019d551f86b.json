Henrik, 28, won the European title in the 1,500m in 2012 and Filip, 26, the European title over the same distance in 2016.\n\nTheir compatriot Karsten Warholm, defending champion in the 400 metres hurdles, comfortably reached the semi-finals by winning his heat as did his major rival Rai Benjamin of the United States.\n\nWarholm ran the second-fastest time in the event at the Weltklasse meeting in Zurich last month.\n\nDespite the searing heat in Doha, the heats were run in pleasant spring-like conditions thanks to the air-conditioning at the Khalifa stadium.", "description": "The Ingebrigtsen family's dream of having three brothers in the 5,000 metres world championships final remained alive on Friday after Jakob, the youngest of the trio, won an appeal after being disqualified in his first heat.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434681113&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q1W8", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
