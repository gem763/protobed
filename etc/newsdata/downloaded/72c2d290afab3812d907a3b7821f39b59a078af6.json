However, other members of the Libra Association, including Visa and Mastercard, have been reluctant to publicly endorse the project in recent weeks.\n\nPayPal\u2019s move now risks opening the floodgates for other members of the association, a group of payments and cryptocurrency firms, telecoms operators and non-profits, to distance themselves from the project.\n\nThe company\u2019s loss is a particular blow to Facebook because of the strong links between the two companies. David Marcus, the head of Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency unit, once ran PayPal and the company handles payments on Facebook.", "description": "PayPal has become the first company to officially quit Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency, just four months after being announced as one of its founding members.", "authors": ["James Titcomb", "Laurence Dodds"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000212017196-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
