I\u2019m just not able to confirm that one way or another.\u201d\n\nMcKenzie also rejected reports that the mission had to be sped up because of Trump\u2019s order to withdraw U.S. forces from northeastern Syria earlier this month. \u201cAbsolutely not. We chose the time based on a variety of factors \u2014 weather, certainty, lunar data, a variety of things like that,\u201d McKenzie said, adding that the withdrawal order \u201cwas not a limiting factor.\u201d\n\nAs they did with al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden following his death in a 2011 Navy SEAL raid, U.S. troops disposed of the ISIS leader\u2019s remains at sea. \u201cFollowing collection of samples for formal DNA analysis, Baghdadi\u2019s remains were buried at sea,\u201d McKenzie said, noting that this would prevent the site of his death from becoming a \u201cshrine.\u201d\n\nThe Defense Intelligence Agency confirmed Baghdadi\u2019s identity by comparing the DNA to a sample collected when he was a prisoner of U.S. forces in Iraq in 2004, McKenzie explained, saying that results proved his death \u201cbeyond a shadow of a doubt.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c7/72/d72edd6147948750c2b18dfda7bf/191030-mackenzie-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
