He\u2019s now reconsidered.\n\nAndy Byford, the widely lauded New York City subways chief, resigned last week, multiple sources told POLITICO on Thursday. He's now reconsidering.\n\nSince he sent his resignation letter to Ronnie Hakim, managing director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, officials have been trying to talk him back from the ledge. They appear to have had some success, though as of Friday morning, Byford had yet to officially rescind the letter.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"I'm not going anywhere and I remain laser focused on improving day-to-day service for millions of New Yorkers and delivering a transformed transit network,\" Byford said in a statement provided by the MTA. \"The historic $51 billion capital plan provides a golden opportunity to further transform the subway and bus network \u2014 with unprecedented investments in accessibility \u2014 and my team and I are totally focused on achieving that. The Governor and I are on exactly the same page about the need to dramatically improve the transit system in New York and we now have the plan and the funding to do that.\"\n\nThe reasons Byford elucidated for resigning were basically twofold, according to one source: He\u2019s tired of having to help organize gubernatorial-driven conferences about signaling and technology, which distract him from his job of improving subway and bus service, and he\u2019s disinclined to preside over possible service cuts or layoffs.\n\nThe MTA is considering reducing the size of its workforce and cutting service on one of Brooklyn's busiest bus lines, even as Gov. Andrew Cuomo is also imposing new operational costs on the MTA in the form of 500 new cops.\n\nA spokesperson for the governor had no immediate comment.\n\nByford\u2019s shot across the bow comes even as Cuomo has made an effort in recent months to paper over his differences with the subway chief, whom he had a hand in hiring. The governor has recently adopted a warmer tone \u2014 in public and in private \u2014 when mentioning Byford, leading to talk of a rapprochement, as POLITICO reported in September.\n\n\u201cByford leaving would be a huge loss for New Yorkers,\u201d said Nick Sifuentes, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. \u201cIf Byford leaves, it\u2019s hard to imagine who would want to fill that role that would be able to do it anywhere near as well as him.\u201d", "description": "Since the subways chief sent his resignation letter to MTA's managing director, officials have been trying to talk him back from the ledge.", "authors": ["Dana Rubinstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8a/31/9845776f4cb8be1a2c4aa3f3087f/27935673568-a474104539-o-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
