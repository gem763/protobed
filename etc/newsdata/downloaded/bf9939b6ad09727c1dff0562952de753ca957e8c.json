Thursday's decision means that preparations for the European Public Prosecutor's Office, which will tackle crimes related to the EU budget, can press ahead.\n\nThe move is a big win for the European Parliament \u2014 in particular the centrist-liberal Renew Europe and center-right European People's Party \u2014 who fought K\u00f6vesi's corner. It is also a victory for French President Emmanuel Macron, who reversed his own position over the summer and backed K\u00f6vesi rather than his countryman Bohnert.\n\nBut it's a blow for the Romanian Social Democrats (PSD), who last year had K\u00f6vesi sacked as head of the National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA).\n\nThe decision was a victory for \"all Romanians who in the last years supported the anti-corruption fight and defended the rule of law, especially in the difficult moments,\u201d K\u00f6vesi told Romanian broadcaster Digi24.\n\nRomanian opposition politicians were quick to claim credit for K\u00f6vesi's victory: One group, USR PLUS Alliance, which is part of Renew Europe, wrote on Facebook that it was its MEPs who had \"made the difference that led to today's positive vote.\"\n\nPresident Klaus Iohannis, a former member of the opposition National Liberal Party and who hopes to stay in his post after November's election, said he is happy about K\u00f6vesi\u2019s victory.\n\n\u201cToday's result is an important victory for Romania, especially since it was obtained despite the fact that the PSD government has tried permanently to block the candidacy of a professional, recognized for her fight against corruption and in the defense of the rule of law,\u201d he said in a statement. Iohannis was forced to fire K\u00f6vesi as the chief of the national anti-corruption body last year after being ordered to do so by the Constitutional Court at the request of the justice minister.\n\nBut it was Macron who ensured K\u00f6vesi's victory when he took the unusual step of abandoning his own candidate as part of a strategy to empower liberal groups in the EU's eastern states.\n\nNominating K\u00f6vesi for the top prosecutor post also allowed Macron to make the case that a citizen of a newer member country will now hold an important post in the bloc, despite eastern countries having no senior position in the European Commission or European Council.\n\nRomanian politicians have high hopes for K\u00f6vesi.\n\n\"The EPPO must be established quickly, so it can start tackling the scourge of corruption & defending the rule of law in Europe,\" tweeted Romanian opposition politician Dacian Ciolo\u0219, who leads Renew Europe in the European Parliament.\n\nBut expectations among K\u00f6vesi's most ardent supporters could face a reality check. The new institution's competence is limited to crimes related to the EU budget, tackling corruption or fraud connected to EU funds, and issues such as cross-border VAT fraud \u2014 a very different kind of work from her time in Romania.\n\nNevertheless, Romanian Prime Minister Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103 maintains that K\u00f6vesi is the wrong choice for the job.\n\nRomania\u2019s image would suffer if pending accusations against K\u00f6vesi prove to be true, D\u0103ncil\u0103 told Romanian radio station Europa Libera. \"We all have to be equal before the law and it's important that before occupying a position, one should be able to clarify all the accusations pending against one's person,\" she said.\n\nK\u00f6vesi was indicted earlier this year on charges of bribery, abuse of office and false statements and was briefly banned from leaving the country. Romania\u2019s High Court lifted the travel ban shortly after.\n\nThe former DNA chief told Digi24 she thinks the accusations have been laid to rest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a too beautiful day for the Romanian justice [system] to enter into a public debate with politicians who attack us,\u201d she said.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s coverage of the EU budget, tracking the development of the seven-year Multiannual Financial Framework.
