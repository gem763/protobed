My arthritis was acting up pretty bad.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Joan MacDonald)\n\n\"I could barely walk up and down the stairs and I hadn't even been to the gym in several months because my knee that I had replaced was really hurting me.\n\n\"My daughter was becoming concerned about my health and asked me to join her annual transformation program. Well, she pretty much told me to join it, to be honest.\n\n\"I started out pretty overwhelmed as it was all online, and I had to get an iPhone and learn all about apps. I was in tears at times, ready to throw in the towel, but luckily, I was too darn stubborn.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Joan MacDonald)\n\n\"My daughter and son-in-law would coach me through again and again, how to use my phone. You could say it took a village.\n\n\"To be honest, I think what really helped me was that this time I was okay to go slowly, and just take my time.\n\n\"Trust me, I had lost a lot of weight before, many times in fact; I had tried Weight Watchers and Counterweight to great success, but the weight always came back.\n\n\"I am now one hundred per cent off of my medication, including my heart medication for high blood pressure, my acid reflux medication and my medication for high cholesterol.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Joan MacDonald)\n\n\"This fitness journey will undoubtedly improve my quality of life as I move deeper into old age. I'm very grateful for that.\n\n\"I feel much better about myself now and getting compliments from younger men and women sure boosts the self-esteem.\"\n\nJoan has also changed her diet: before she would eat two slices of toast with jam and coffee for breakfast, a sandwich and fruit salad for lunch, meat and vegetables and dessert for dinner and she would snack on sweets, chocolates or nuts.\n\nNow she sticks to a healthier meal plan: egg whites, cheese, meat, vegetables and bread or half a bagel for breakfast, coconut milk, protein powder, fruit and ice blended for a smoothie for lunch and for dinner she now has meat, vegetables and a salad.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Joan MacDonald)\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Joan MacDonald)\n\nShe now says that her new look has prompted attention from younger men who give her compliments that have boosted her self-confidence, including her husband who has noticed a change in her.\n\n\"I was on a meal plan set up by Michelle with 'X' number of calories; primarily protein, carbs and good fats and as the weight and inches came down my intake of food went up,\" she said.\n\n\"I also went to the gym four or five days a week and followed her exercise programme which changed every four weeks and I did daily cardio.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Joan MacDonald)\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Joan MacDonald)\n\n\"It has changed the way I feel about myself; people at my gym would approach me and compliment me on the changes they saw in me.\n\n\"I feel much better about myself now and getting compliments from younger men and women sure boosts the self-esteem. My husband started remarking about how good I looked, and my family was so proud of my efforts.\n\n\"I have an easier time staying away from junk or fast foods and as for exercise, I will keep at it because there's always room for change and improvement.\n\n\"People are very complimentary and somewhat surprised that I've kept it off this long and I'm still changing; I have more muscle definition now than when I first lost the weight.\n\n\"For those who truly feel at a loss, I'd say change one thing with your food intake and one exercise to do and each week add something new. Don't expect miracles right away, take it slow and steady but keep building.\n\n\"For those who prefer a challenge, go to a gym and if possible get yourself a legitimate trainer, someone who can help with food as well and you will achieve results faster.\"", "description": "Once Canadian fitness fanatic Joan MacDonald discovered she could use her iPhone to plan her meals and workouts she began shedding pounds fast", "authors": ["Liana Jacob", "Image", "Mdwfeatures", "Joan Macdonald"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20644489.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-iPhone-OAP-Transformation.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
