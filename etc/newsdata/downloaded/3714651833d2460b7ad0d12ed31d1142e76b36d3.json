You can't rule out having a general election if Parliament cannot pass this deal and is still stuck, and you cannot rule out a second referendum.'\n\nA small group of protesters had formed outside the hotel prior to Mr Cameron's talk, and he was repeatedly interrupted during the event.\n\nAt one stage, as he discussed the reasons for calling the 2016 referendum, one woman stood up and shouted: 'I think the good people of Harrogate came here to hear an apology from you.'\n\nAs other audience members responded with a mixture of angry boos and applause, a man called out: 'Apologise for ruining our country.'\n\nIt came after the author had described the three years following the referendum as 'very painful for the country'.\n\nWhen Mr Cameron was at one stage discussing ways to unite the country following the division of the referendum, another man interrupted and shouted: 'Your policy of austerity did absolutely nothing to bring this country together.'\n\nWhen the man spoke across him as he attempted to respond, the former Conservative party leader quipped: 'You can pay \u00a335 to shout at me in here, or you can shout at me outside for free afterwards.'\n\nThe comment prompted cheers from the remaining members of the crowd.", "description": "The ex-prime minister made the remarks during a\u00a0talk which was repeatedly interrupted by protesters criticising his decision to call the 2016 referendum - which he lost.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/12/19881858-0-image-a-33_1571398854773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
