On May 8, the U.S. accused China of backtracking on almost all aspects of a deal, and two days later more than doubled tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods. That set off months of escalation in which ease side raised duties on the other's goods.\n\nZezas says it\u2019s important to \u201cseparate the signal from the noise\u201d when trying to decipher if a \u201creal deal\u201d is coming together. He says the signal would be \u201cmeaningful concession\u201d preceded by one of three circuit breakers:\n\nWeakness in risk assets A slowdown in economic data Increased political risk\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAny of these would create incentives for one or both sides to make concessions on core issues,\u201d Zezas wrote, adding that he doesn\u2019t think that any of the elements are there yet.\n\nEquity markets in the U.S. remain strong, with the S&P 500 less than 1 percent from an all-time high. While China\u2019s Shanghai Composite is 10 percent below its April peak, it has been rallying in recent weeks.\n\nBoth countries have seen their GDP growth slow since the trade war began.\n\nChina\u2019s GDP expanded just 6.2 percent in the second quarter, its weakest since 1992, and is expected to slow further without a resolution to the trade war.\n\n\u201cWith more extensive and higher U.S. tariffs activated, we expect stiffer headwind on Chinese exports,\" which will thwart investment in expansion such as new factories and become the catalyst for policy turnaround, a team of Hong Kong- based economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote on Sept. 4. They see China\u2019s growth slowing to 5.7 percent in 2020.\n\nBut the U.S. economy has been slowing down too. Second-quarter GDP grew at a 2 percent annualized rate, down from 3.1 percent the prior quarter. That's considerably less than President Trump's goal of 3 percent to 4 percent economic growth.\n\nSal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, sees the U.S. economy\u2019s growth slowing to 1.9 percent in the third quarter and getting weaker into next year.\n\n\u201cEconomic growth is expected to stay modest at 1.6 percent in Q4 and 1.8 percent in 2020, with the drag from trade protectionism tempered by easier monetary policy and about $50 billion of new federal spending announced in the July budget deal,\u201d he wrote.\n\nPolitical risk appears to be limited in both countries as Trump\u2019s poll numbers have remained steady and Chinese President Xi Jinping has been granted the ability to remain president for life.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cUnless those circuit breakers are tripped in the coming months, we\u2019d expect the tariffs to eventually take effect (even as another delay of the upcoming October 15 tariffs remains a distinct possibility), keeping pressure on risk assets over the medium term,\u201d Zezas concluded.", "description": "There are three circuit breakers that you need to pay attention to.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/trumpxikm-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
