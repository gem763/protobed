Phillip Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) reacts to entrepreneur Andrew Yang on Sept. 12, 2019, during a Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by ABC at Texas Southern University in Houston.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said fellow 2020 presidential contender Andrew Yang is challenging other candidates to be \u201cmore innovative\u201d when asked about her reaction to his money giveaway announcement at the latest Democratic presidential debate Thursday night.\n\nDuring his opening statement on the debate stage at the historically Black Texas Southern University, Yang said his campaign will give away $1,000 a month to randomly selected families over the course of a year to test his universal basic income proposal.\n\n\u201cThis is how we will get our country working for us again, the American people,\u201d the entrepreneur said.\n\nThe audience cheered for Yang, who then pointed to the crowd in a playful manner.\n\nAs the TV camera panned over to South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Harris could distinctly be heard laughing in the background. A smiling Buttigieg then said after a pause: \u201cIt\u2019s original, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d\n\nWatch the sequence here:\n\nOn Friday, CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota asked Harris her thoughts on Yang\u2019s money giveaway moment, noting that the senator could be heard laughing after Yang announced it.\n\nHarris responded by saying that she takes \u201cjoy\u201d in \u201chearing people with innovative ideas and who are questioning the status quo and willing to challenge it.\u201d (Watch the entire debate on ABC News here.)\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s healthy for our democracy,\u201d Harris continued. \u201cAnd one of the things I like about Andrew Yang is he is constantly raising ideas and approaches that have not typically been on that debate stage, and I think he is challenging all of us to think about how we can be more innovative, and I admire that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all fun and games until Andrew Yang passes you in the polls. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 12, 2019\n\nYang\u2019s Thursday night announcement aligns with the universal basic income proposal central to his campaign: Give every U.S. citizen over the age of 18 guaranteed payments of $1,000 per month.\n\nHis proposal aims to address the impact of growing automation, which he argues threatens to cause widespread unemployment.\n\nThe next Democratic presidential debate is slated for Oct. 15, and possibly Oct. 16, depending on how many candidates qualify.", "description": "The California senator was asked about her reaction to the entrepreneur's plan after she was heard laughing on the debate stage.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7c2c362300005805531c79.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
