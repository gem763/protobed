But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered, and for good reason. When it comes time to actually get something done \u2014 whether that\u2019s editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family \u2014 the laptop is often the ideal device for the job.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say there haven\u2019t been advancements in the world of laptops or notebook computers. We no longer have to deal with inch-plus-thick clunkers that weigh upwards of seven pounds and last less than two hours away from an outlet. The modern laptop is lightweight, sleek, efficient, easily portable, and powerful enough to get most computing tasks done.\n\nWhat separates a good laptop from a great one is how it balances power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. It should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad \u2014 after all, those are the two biggest reasons you\u2019d choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren\u2019t distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for almost anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in. Increasingly, it should have a touchscreen to provide more flexibility with how you are able to interact with the laptop.\n\nNaming \u201cthe best laptop\u201d is a little different than naming the best phone or tablet. Needs for laptops can vary widely. Some people need to do intense video editing and should pony up for a pro machine. Others just need a reliable keyboard and a few windows, so something less powerful will do. Some might want a super light laptop that can sometimes double as a tablet. Some will want a portable gaming machine capable of running all of the latest titles. Here, we\u2019re talking about the best all-around product: a traditional laptop that will work well doing most things for most people, and even stretch to handle more intensive tasks on occasion.\n\nThere are plenty of great options in the Windows PC world, complete with the latest processors and designs, but Apple\u2019s MacBook lineup has been plagued with keyboard reliability issues, which makes them hard to enthusiastically recommend. Still, if you have your heart set on buying a macOS laptop for familiarity or compatibility reasons, we have a pick for you, too.\n\nThis guide does not include gaming laptops; if that\u2019s something you\u2019re looking for, we have a separate guide for that. This article will be continually updated as new laptops are released and reviewed, so be sure to check back if you\u2019re not in the market right now.\n\nThe best laptop right now: Dell XPS 13\n\nDell\u2019s XPS 13 is the best overall laptop available right now. It has a very compact and portable design, a reliable keyboard, a great trackpad, excellent performance, and a wide variety of configurations at various price points. It can handle almost any kind of productivity work you might need to do, whether that\u2019s taking notes in classes all day long or slogging through emails in an office. It can also handle photo editing and even some light video editing from time to time.\n\nDell has been using the same design on the XPS 13 for years, so it probably looks rather familiar. But the latest model finally addressed the biggest problem with the XPS 13\u2019s design: the webcam placement. Dell used to put the webcam below the screen, which would provide horribly unflattering angles for video calls. For the 2019 refresh, Dell finally moved the camera up to the top bezel above the display and it works just as well as any other laptop\u2019s webcam. It\u2019s a surprisingly good quality camera as well, and though it doesn\u2019t support Windows 10\u2019s facial recognition login system, Dell provides a quick and easy-to-use fingerprint scanner embedded in the XPS 13\u2019s power button.\n\nThe XPS 13 starts well under $1,000, but our recommended configuration will likely cost slightly more than that. That includes a quad-core Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a 1080p, touchscreen display. There is a 4K touchscreen option, which does look beautiful, but isn\u2019t really necessary at this size and will provide worse battery life compared to the 1080p version. The other thing that\u2019s not worth paying for is the higher-end Core i7 processor: the XPS 13 is a thin and light computer, which means it will not be able to easily cool more powerful processors, negating their advantage. (This advice goes for basically every laptop in this segment.)\n\nOne advantage of having the non-touch display is longer battery life. In our tests of the 4K panel, we saw over eight hours of use between charges. If you\u2019re using the 1080p display, you can expect an even longer battery life.\n\nOverall, the XPS 13 is just a great balance of all the things that make a great laptop, with very few compromises to get there. Dell is likely going to revamp its XPS line in the near future, but until that happens, you really can\u2019t go wrong with the mature and capable XPS 13.\n\nThe Mac option: Apple MacBook Pro 13 (two USB-C ports)\n\nIf you are looking for a Mac laptop and are unable or unwilling to consider a Windows PC, then the best option available now is the latest version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro. This model has two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports (which distinguishes it from the more expensive models with four ports) and a quad-core Core i5 processor. Our recommended configuration has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage and is priced just under $1,500.\n\nThe MacBook Pro is more expensive than Apple\u2019s entry-level laptop, the MacBook Air. But it justifies that cost with much better performance and quieter operation, without adding too much weight or bulk to its design. It is able to handle lots of browser tabs, virtual desktops, and frequent multitasking with ease, and it can hold its own with photo and light video editing, too. As with the XPS 13, it is not worth spending more to upgrade to the higher-end processor; as long as you\u2019re getting a quad-core Core i5 chip, you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nThe Pro also includes the Touch Bar, a touchscreen strip just above the keyboard that replaces the traditional row of function keys. Opinions on the Touch Bar are decidedly mixed, and many owners don\u2019t find it to be any more useful than the old function keys for adjusting screen brightness and volume. There are some neat things you can do with it through third-party apps, and we don\u2019t think its existence is enough to tank the MacBook Pro.\n\nThe Pro\u2019s keyboard is a different story, however. The Pro still has the extremely low-profile butterfly switch keyboard found on the prior model and every other MacBook you can buy right now, but it has been revised with the \u201cnew materials\u201d and dust shield that Apple introduced in later iterations. This has the effect of making the keyboard slightly quieter to type on, but these changes are primarily to improve the reliability of the keyboard, so it\u2019s less likely to succumb to stuck or doubling keys because a tiny piece of dust got lodged in the switch.\n\nIn response to years of reported keyboard problems, Apple is now offering a four-year warranty and free repair service for any customer that experiences the following issues with their MacBook\u2019s keyboard:\n\nLetters or characters repeat unexpectedly\n\nLetters or characters do not appear\n\nKey(s) feel \u201csticky\u201d or do not respond in a consistent manner\n\nWe applaud Apple for acknowledging the issue and providing support for customers affected by it. But without a clear answer on whether it has addressed the fundamental design that causes these issues, it\u2019s quite possible that the problems will come back over time. That means that you\u2019ll likely have to go through the process of getting your laptop fixed when the keyboard fails at some point, which is a hassle, even if it\u2019s free.\n\nOther options\n\nIf you don\u2019t like Dell\u2019s XPS 13 or the new MacBook Pro, there are a lot of other laptops to choose from. Some might be better options if you\u2019re a gamer or an artist who wants something to draw on, while others are even more light and portable than our top picks.\n\nOur review of Apple MacBook Air (2019) Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Touch ID for login\n\nTrue Tone display looks great\n\nThin, classic design Bad Stuff Processor can sometimes struggle\n\nUSB-C ecosystem still a hassle\n\nCan you really trust this keyboard?
