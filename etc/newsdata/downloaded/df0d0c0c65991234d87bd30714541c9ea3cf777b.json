The former New York mayor has hardly made any secret of his quest. The Washington Post reported in May, \u201cTrump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani had a lengthy meeting last week with a former Ukrainian diplomat as part of aggressive efforts aimed at gathering information to undermine Democrats in the United States.\u201d Giuliani did not deny the report.\n\nIn August, The New York Times reported on further meetings in Madrid: \u201cMr. Giuliani said he was acting on his own as a private citizen, with the knowledge and assistance of the State Department. He would not say whether Mr. Trump approved\u2014or is aware of\u2014the effort.\u201d According to State, the department put Giuliani in touch with an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the aide\u2019s request.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that Trump didn\u2019t know his personal lawyer was traveling to Spain to gather dirt on his leading Democratic rival, though even if he didn\u2019t explicitly know, it hardly matters. As Jeffrey Goldberg has written, and as Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report reinforced, Trump operates in the manner of a Mafia boss, knowing what he can leave implicit for aides to do.\n\nRead: Trump\u2019s plea for Russia to hack the U.S. government\n\nBeyond that, the Zelensky administration would have reasonably concluded that Giuliani was acting at Trump\u2019s behest as well as on his behalf. Zelensky would also have known the precarious position he is in, with Russia menacing his country; and he would have known about Trump\u2019s many positive statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin, including shrugging his shoulders at the annexation of Crimea. Beyond that, Ukraine was directly trying to obtain $250 million in aid from the United States\u2014which Trump could approve or stop.\n\nAt a press conference earlier this month, after Vice President Mike Pence met with Zelensky, a reporter asked Pence, \u201cDid you discuss Joe Biden at all during that meeting yesterday with the Ukrainian president? And No. 2, can you assure Ukraine that the holdup of that money has absolutely nothing to do with efforts, including by Rudy Giuliani, to try to dig up dirt on the Biden family?\u201d Pence flatly denied discussing Biden. But he never answered the second question. A few days later, the Trump administration released the money to Ukraine, and Zelensky thanked Trump.\n\nToday the Daily Beast quoted an aide to the Ukrainian interior minister saying that the country would investigate Biden if asked by the United States.\n\n\u201cClearly, Trump is now looking for kompromat to discredit his opponent Biden, to take revenge for his friend Paul Manafort, who is serving seven years in prison,\u201d Anton Geraschenko said. \u201cWe do not investigate Biden in Ukraine, since we have not received a single official request to do so.\u201d", "description": "Just like in 2016, the president\u2019s most egregious misconduct is unfolding in the open.", "authors": ["David A.
