Earlier he said the British approval process needed to be completed before the EU parliament would fully vote on it.\n\nWith time tight before Thursday\u2019s last slated session of the EU parliament, a technical extension of the Oct. 31 date likely would be needed.\n\nThe next EU plenary beyond next week would be Nov. 13, necessitating at least a two-week extension for the EU final approval.\n\n___\n\n4:15 p.m.\n\nThe British government looks set to try again next week to get Parliament to back its divorce deal with the European Union, after lawmakers voted to delay the decision.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg says the government will seek a debate Monday on its Brexit-implementing legislation that would effectively be a vote to approve the deal.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether that would be allowed under House of Commons rules against holding repeated votes on the same question. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said he would make a ruling Monday.\n\nLawmakers voted Saturday to withhold their approval for the Brexit deal until all legislation to implement it has been passed.\n\nIn the meantime, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is required to ask the EU to delay Britain\u2019s departure, currently scheduled for Oct. 31.\n\nJohnson is still aiming to get the deal approved by Oct. 31 so no delay is necessary.\n\n___\n\n3:50 p.m.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki says his country does not see Saturday\u2019s vote by British lawmakers as a rejection of the Brexit deal but rather as a delay.\n\nMorawiecki said in a Twitter message immediately after the vote that Poland \u201cwill support a positive approach on EU level to @BorisJohnson government proposal.\u201d\n\nHe added that, for the 27 EU leaders \u201cAvoiding chaotic, no-deal #brexit should be our top priority.\u201d\n\nThe EU leaders will have to decide on any extension to the Oct. 31 deadline.\n\n___\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nThe European Union says it is up to the U.K. government to tell the 27 EU member states \u201cas soon as possible\u201d what action it will take after the Brexit deal was not voted on Saturday.\n\nEU Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said the EU executive took note of the vote and did not suggest a course of action.\n\n\u201cIt will be for the UK government to inform us about the next steps as soon as possible,\u201d she said on Twitter.\n\nHad the deal been approved, the EU parliament had planned to back the Brexit deal by Thursday evening.\n\n___\n\n3 p.m.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he will push ahead and try to leave European Union by Oct. 31.\n\nHe said Saturday he is not daunted or dismayed by a vote delaying approval of the new Brexit deal, and said there will be no new negotiations with the EU.\n\nHe says he still believes he can command \u201coverwhelming\u201d support for the new Brexit divorce plan and will introduce the required legislation to make that happen.\n\nJohnson says he is not compelled by the law to negotiate any further with the EU.\n\n___\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nBritish lawmakers have voted to postpone a decision on whether to back a Brexit deal with the European Union, throwing a wrench into government plans to leave the bloc at the end of this month.\n\nAt a special session of Parliament intended to ratify the deal, lawmakers instead voted 322-306 to withhold their approval until legislation to implement the agreement has been passed.\n\nThe vote is a major blow to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and means he has to ask the EU to delay Britain\u2019s departure. Parliament previously passed a law compelling him to do that if a deal had not been passed by Saturday.\n\nThe move is intended to ensure the U.K. can\u2019t crash out of the EU without a deal on the scheduled Oct. 31 departure date.\n\nThe government still hopes it can pass the needed legislation by the end of the month so the U.K. can leave on time.\n\n___\n\n1:40 p.m.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Theresa May, whose Brexit deal was rejected by Parliament three times, says she is backing the agreement struck by her successor Boris Johnson.\n\nMay told lawmakers she had a \u201cdistinct sense of deja vu\u201d as Parliament debated whether to back Johnson\u2019s EU divorce deal. She resigned in frustration after lawmakers repeatedly threw out her Brexit agreement.\n\nJohnson\u2019s deal is similar to May\u2019s in some ways but contains a different arrangement for maintaining an open Irish border.\n\nMay said Parliament should pass the deal and let Britain leave the EU on Oct. 31. She said \u201cpeople want certainty in their lives. . If you want this country to move forward then vote for the deal today.\u201d\n\n___\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nTens of thousands of anti-Brexit protesters are marching through London as lawmakers debate Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s new European Union divorce deal.\n\nProtesters, many wearing blue berets emblazoned with yellow stars symbolizing the EU flag, poured out of subway trains and buses for the march to Parliament Square on Saturday.\n\nIn one side street, a group of demonstrators with bells strapped to their legs and wielding sticks performed a traditional English morris dance and chanted: \u201cMorris, not Boris!\u201d to cheers from onlookers.\n\nOne of the dancers, Kate Fisher, says \u201cdemos that are fun and joyful are more effective.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the mood was less cheerful.\n\nSarah Spoor, who cares for her two children with disabilities, choked back tears as she said she is \u201cdistraught\u201d at the prospect of Britain leaving the EU.\n\n___\n\n11:50 a.m.\n\nThousands of Brexit opponents are gathering in central London to call for Britain to remain part of the European Union.\n\nThe crowds are planning to converge on Parliament Square as legislators are voting on Brexit departure plans put forth by Conservative British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nMany carried signs calling for a halt to the Brexit process that started with a 2016 referendum in which British voters narrowly backed taking Britain out of the 28-nation bloc.\n\nProtester Bruce Nicole, a vicar from Camberley southwest of London, said the Brexit deal would harm Britain.\n\nHe says \u201cI fervently believe that we should remain in the EU.\u201d He adds \u201cI am British but I am also European. I don\u2019t believe the current deal offers any benefits at all.\u201d\n\n___\n\n10 a.m.\n\nOpposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has told Parliament that the Brexit deal on which lawmakers are voting risks jobs, rights, the environment and the health service.\n\nThe Labour Party leader told Parliament Saturday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s new deal is substantially worse than the one it replaces, which was voted down three times.\n\nCorbyn says it removes protection for workers\u2019 rights and the environment and replaces them with empty promises. He says it would also reduce Britain\u2019s commitment to fighting climate change.\n\nHe also warns it would hurt British manufacturing.\n\n___\n\n9:50 a.m.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told Parliament that his new Brexit deal can heal the rift in British politics and unite warring factions.\n\nHe used a rare Saturday session to plead with lawmakers to back the new plan.\n\nHe says it would \u201ctake back control\u201d of Britain\u2019s borders, fishing and trade and preserve the gains of the Good Friday agreement that helped end violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nJohnson faces a close vote on his plan with opposition parties determined to block it.\n\n___\n\n9:40 a.m.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to get Parliament to approve his Brexit deal with the European Union has been thrown into doubt.\n\nLawmakers will first vote on whether to withhold approval until legislation to implement the agreement has been passed. That would bring another law into play that would force Johnson to seek a Brexit delay from the European Union.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow said would allow a vote on an amendment that essentially puts the vote on the deal off until another day.\n\nThose behind the amendment say it will remove the risk that the U.K. could stumble out of the bloc without a deal on Oct. 31 because the law is not in place.\n\nThe vote is due later Saturday.\n\n___\n\n8:40 a.m.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan faces what is expected to be an extremely tight vote as Britain\u2019s Parliament prepares for its first Saturday session since the 1982 Falklands war.\n\nAt stake is a new divorce plan agreed between the British government and the other 27 European Union nations at a summit Thursday.\n\nJohnson hopes for success in getting a fractious Parliament to back the deal after his predecessor, Theresa May, failed three times to get lawmakers behind her plan.\n\nJohnson does not have a parliamentary majority but he is hoping to woo some opposition Labour Party lawmakers to his side.\n\nHe said in The Sun newspaper on Saturday that a vote for the plan would bring a \u201cpainful chapter in our history\u201d to an end.", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Brexit (all times local): 4:20 p.m. The European Parliament's chief Brexit official says expert legislators will assess the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/19/3c7ff0_britain-brexit-04525-britain-prime-minister-boris-johnson-stands-left-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
