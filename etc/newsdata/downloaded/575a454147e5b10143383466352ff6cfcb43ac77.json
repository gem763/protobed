It could also mean increased security restrictions at the ballpark for what is expected to be a capacity crowd.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals lead the Astros 2-0 in the best-of-seven series, with Game 3 scheduled for Friday night and Game 4 on Saturday, both in Washington. The Nationals would have to lose at least one of those games for there to be a Game 5 on Sunday.\n\nTrump made his remarks while presenting auto racing icon Roger Penske with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor, in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump could face a mixed reaction from the crowd, including the potential of boos. In 2005, then-Vice President Richard Cheney threw out the first pitch at the Nationals\u2019 first game in Washington, at RFK Stadium, and was booed at a time when there was growing public opposition to the war in Iraq.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the president of this country. If he want to come to the game, it\u2019s something that he want to do,\u201d Nationals pitcher Anibal Sanchez said. \u201cOf course everybody has to respect that situation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump has attended at least four sporting events since taking office.\n\nHe stood on the field for the national anthem at the college football national championship game in January 2018, at a time when he was publicly criticizing former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for having knelt during the anthem in protest of police tactics in minority communities. Trump left at halftime and missed the thrilling finish in Alabama\u2019s overtime victory against Georgia. He also attended the Army-Navy football game later that year in Philadelphia.\n\nAD\n\nHe also handed out a trophy at the President\u2019s Cup golf tournament in 2017 and watched a Grand Sumo tournament in Tokyo during a state visit to Japan this past spring.\n\nTrump has thrown out a ceremonial first pitch on a few occasions before becoming president, including in 2004 when he landed in his Trump-branded private helicopter on the field for a Somerset Patriots minor league game in Bridgewater Township, N.J.\n\nAD", "description": "The president did not confirm whether he would throw out the ceremonial first pitch in the series between the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros.", "authors": ["David Nakamura", "Reporter Covering The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/exzfaORXzGXa5KI9YHLN6iVj8ww=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H7B7T5XWU4I6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
