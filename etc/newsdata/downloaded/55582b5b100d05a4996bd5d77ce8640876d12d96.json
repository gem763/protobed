When the acclaimed sportswriter\u2019s publisher asked him to pen a biography of Babe Ruth, he figured he had nothing to add to the slugger\u2019s story. But he did focus in on one aspect of the Bambino\u2019s life: his ability to inspire wonder like nobody else, save for the most famous magician of all time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a century since he was at his height and yet he\u2019s still the guy that you can go to almost anybody anywhere, any country and say, \u2018Houdini,\u2019 and they know who he is,\u201d Posnanski tells InsideHook about the genesis of his new book, The Life and Afterlife of Harry Houdini. \u201cI realized he\u2019s absolutely everywhere and we don\u2019t even think about it. You start seeing dogs that escape from yards, babies that escape from cribs, somebody who pulls off some weird crime and they\u2019re a Houdini. A pitcher who gets out of a bases-loaded jam or a quarterback who gets out of a sack, he\u2019s like a Houdini. That\u2019s what made me think. \u2018All right, this is a book.\u2019\u201d\n\nOut Oct. 22, Life and Afterlife is a departure for the author, whose other books have all been about sports, such as The Soul of Baseball, about Negro League legend Buck O\u2019Neil and Paterno, an inside look at the legendary coach that Posnanski was writing when the Penn State scandal hit. But, as Posnanski sees it, the escape artist isn\u2019t all that different from some of the all-time great athletes like Jordan and Brady, not to mention Trump, in his larger-than-life legacy and drive to win at all costs. We asked him to explain that and more about the magician, the Paterno controversy, and how a baseball player become the next wonder-inspiring superstar.\n\nThe Surprises of Houdini\n\nHad Posnanski known how many books were written about Houdini before his, he says he might not have even tried his hand at writing Life and Afterlife. But his ignorance on the subject matter ends up driving the narrative, as the author discovers how much is still unknown about Houdini\u2019s life, including how he pulled off a famous 1904 escape from the \u201cMirror cuffs,\u201d a unique set of shackles that London\u2019s Daily Mirror had specifically made for the magician.\n\n\u201cEverything surprised me,\u201d says Posnanski. \u201cI knew so little going in. One was what depths he was willing to go to create this character that is Houdini. Fifty years after his death, [his devotees] still didn\u2019t know where he was born. They created this whole magical-community committee to find out and they went all over the country, to Budapest, to Germany, all these different places and searched for anything resembling a birth certificate. Fifty years that guy had everybody convinced he was born in the United States and he was wasn\u2019t! And it\u2019s such a small thing in so many ways \u2014 I mean, he came here when he was 4 \u2014 but that surprised me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second biggest surprise was that there was still a mystery,\u201d he adds. \u201cCopperfield was the first person I talked to about it, but talking to multiple magicians and people who studied this their whole lives, every one of them saying, \u2018We don\u2019t know how he got out of the Mirror cuffs.\u2019 A hundred years later, we still don\u2019t know! We have theories, we have opinions. There\u2019s still this one thing he did that even people who have unmasked him in every possible way don\u2019t really know how he did it.\u201d\n\nThe Athletes With Houdini Personalities\n\nJust like a player who feeds off of trash talk and treats every opponent like they killed his dog, Houdini\u2019s competitive streak in the magic world was vicious. It wasn\u2019t enough for him to be the best at his craft \u2014 he needed to silence, and often humiliate, his rivals, both onstage and in the press.\n\n\u201cIt really is this constant need to win, to defeat anybody who\u2019s trying to try to imitate him or put him down. It did remind me of athletes in the sense that I think great athletes \u2014 many of them, not all of them \u2014 have to go to this dark place in order to be that good. Michael Jordan was absolutely ruthless. He constantly had to feel like he was being slighted and would invent little grudges. That was very Houdini-like. Tom Brady is the same way. He\u2019s been talking about getting drafted in the sixth round for 20 years. He still needs that energy to keep finding the next level. It can be a pretty negative energy, and I think it was for Houdini, especially after he became a success. He really did have to keep finding new fights.\u201d\n\nThe Similarities to Trump\n\nLike the President, Houdini was a master manipulator when it came to the media, using newspapers to hype his act with fake controversies and other outright lies. Also like Trump, his need for attention and to always be right, no matter the evidence to the contrary, wasn\u2019t just an act.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re different in many ways, but in the way that Houdini was a showman and created this character, the similarities are dead on,\u201d Posnanski says. \u201cHoudini could never stop being this character and Trump is exactly the same. Trump created this persona that whatever percentage of the country is in love with and he never backs off of it. He\u2019ll tell as many stories as he has to and he will not let go of a single thing. The weather map, Houdini would\u2019ve done the same thing. If Houdini said the hurricane was going to hit Alabama, he would have gone to the ends of the earth to say he wasn\u2019t wrong. \u2018You build a box, I\u2019ll get out of it. You come with cuffs, I\u2019ll get out of those.\u2019 It was always, \u2018You challenge me and I will win,\u2019 and, boy, that\u2019s Trump to a T, right?\u201d\n\nHow Baseball Can Get Another Transcendent Star\n\nOne of the biggest knocks against baseball now is how the game doesn\u2019t have megastars the way it used to, certainly nowhere near the likes of Ruth. Though television and social media make it impossible to achieve the Babe\u2019s brand of mystique, Posnanski is sure that MLB will soon have more players whose personas are larger than the game.\n\n\u201cOne point of reference is Mike Trout, this otherworldly, once in a 50-year span type of player, and how he\u2019s not really treated that way,\u201d says Posnanski. \u201cHe\u2019s a private person. He\u2019s not somebody who\u2019s interested in becoming that. Houdini wanted to become famous, Houdini wanted to become immortal, and he worked at it day and night. Reggie Jackson, there\u2019s an example \u2014 he was a much, much more famous player than he was great player. He drove it every day: did every commercial, did broadcasting, gave crazy, outlandish quotes. He wanted to become famous and he did it.\n\nIt\u2019s much harder to do now. When you get to the top, the pressure only builds. Then everybody\u2019s like, \u2018What\u2019s your next act? What\u2019s your next crazy statement?\u2019 and you have to keep going and going. Some people can keep finding new ways to push the envelope, but most can\u2019t. A baseball player who wanted that \u2014 to not only be a great player but be famous, in the zeitgeist \u2014 could do it. They just have to be creative and willing to be out there, all the time.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Joe Posnanski author of \"The Life and Afterlife of Harry Houdini,\" on what the illusionist can teach us about modern America.", "authors": ["Dan Reilly"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-536063283.jpg?fit=1119%2C800", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
