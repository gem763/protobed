I do not think we should abandon the Kurds,\u201d he told a reporter for Politico.\n\nSenate Republican sources said the Pentagon has warned Turkey not to advance into northern Syria, despite interpretations of Trump\u2019s decision to pull back U.S. forces as a go-ahead signal.\n\nTop Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman on Monday said the Defense Department has \u201cmade clear\u201d that \u201cwe do not endorse a Turkish operation in Northern Syria.\u201d\n\nThe following day, Hoffman disputed reports that Trump made his decision without consultating Defense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperOvernight Defense: Trump defends Turkey amid fierce criticism | Senators demand briefing on Syria decision | Turkey confirms strikes on Syrian border | White House says it won't cooperate on impeachment inquiry Top Democrats warn against withdrawing from treaty that allows observation flights over Russia Pentagon insists it was consulted ahead of Syria move MORE and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, adding that U.S. troops were repositioned in Syria to ensure their safety.\n\n\u201cSecretary Esper and Chairman Milley were consulted over the last several days by the President regarding the situation and efforts to protect U.S. forces in Northern Syria in the face of military action by Turkey,\u201d Hoffman said in statement.\n\nHe said the Defense Department continues to hold the position that \u201cestablishing a safe zone in Northern Syria\u201d is the best way to maintain stability.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Turkey has chosen to act unilaterally. As a result we have moved the U.S. forces in Northern Syria out of the path of potential Turkish incursion to ensure their safety,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cWe have made no changes to our force presence in Syria at this time.\u201d\n\nTrump, in a set of mixed messages conveyed via Twitter, threatened to retaliate against Turkey if the country goes too far. But he did not specify what kind of action would cross the line.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey,\u201d Trump tweeted Monday.\n\nThe flurry of events left lawmakers befuddled about Trump\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a sense of waiting to see what the administration is actually going to do,\u201d said a Senate Republican aide who called the situation \u201cclear as mud.\u201d\n\nGOP aides said Trump\u2019s announcement caught Capitol Hill by surprise and appeared to be made off the cuff after a phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is now scheduled to visit the White House in mid-November.\n\nBrett McGurk, a former member of Trump\u2019s national security team, told NPR that the president\u2019s sudden decision to withdraw from Syria appeared made \u201con a haphazard basis after a single call\u201d and called it \u201calmost unprecedented.\u201d\n\nGraham and Coons, in their letter to Senate leaders, raised concerns \u201cthat this was an abrupt decision taken in the face of reported opposition from military and diplomatic leaders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that it is imperative that the Department of Defense, State Department, and the Intelligence Community provide an all-members classified briefing on this decision as soon as possible,\u201d they wrote.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut another one of Trump\u2019s closest allies, Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulOvernight Defense: Republicans urge Trump to reverse course on Syria | Dems subpoena Pentagon in impeachment probe | North Korea talks falter Trump defends Syria move: 'It's time to come back home' McConnell warns Trump against withdrawing troops from Syria MORE (Ky.), defended the president\u2019s action and criticized fellow Republicans for rebelling.\n\n\u201cThey always want to stay at war.

Leaving 300 or 400 people in an area that are vulnerable could lead to catastrophe,\u201d Paul said Monday on Fox News.\n\nIn the House, Democrats said they were looking at several options to push back against Trump\u2019s latest foreign policy move, which caught leaders of both parties by surprise.\n\n\u201cMultiple committees are looking at possible legislative efforts to put the House on record against the president\u2019s outrageous decision,\u201d said a Democratic leadership aide.\n\nWhile House Republicans have not sided with Democrats on many measures critical of Trump, it seemed possible that the Syria decision could be an exception.\n\nThe Senate voted 70-26 in February to advance a resolution authored by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMurkowski warns against rushing to conclusions on Trump impeachment Overnight Defense: Trump defends Turkey amid fierce criticism | Senators demand briefing on Syria decision | Turkey confirms strikes on Syrian border | White House says it won't cooperate on impeachment inquiry McConnell blasts House Democrats over handling of impeachment inquiry MORE (R-Ky.) expressing strong opposition to the precipitous withdrawal of troops from Syria or Afghanistan.\n\nMcConnell reminded Trump of that in a statement Monday, urging him \u201cto exercise American leadership to keep our multinational coalition to defeat ISIS and prevent significant conflict between our NATO ally Turkey and our local Syrian counterterrorism partners,\u201d referring to Kurdish forces.\n\nA second Senate Republican aide said there could be language added to the annual National Defense Authorization Act to influence Trump\u2019s Syria policy.\n\nBut a Republican spokeswoman for the Senate Armed Services Committee noted the bill is still under negotiation and declined to speculate on what might be included in the final version.\n\nThe House version of the legislation limits military spending until the secretary of Defense submits to the congressional committees a detailed report on the military mission to combat Islamic militants in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe House bill also requires the secretaries of Defense and State to submit to Congress plans for providing assistance to vetted Syrian opposition forces.\n\nAside from the defense authorization bill, Congress could pass other measures, from ratcheting up sanctions on Syria to sanctioning foreign individuals who provide support to the Syrian government.\n\nNone of those bills, however, would reverse Trump\u2019s decision on Syria.\n\nBut Graham on Tuesday endorsed the threat of sanctions against Turkey to safeguard against a military strike against Kurdish forces.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey moves into northern Syria, sanctions from hell \u2013 by Congress \u2013 will follow. Wide, deep, and devastating sanctions,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nEllen Mitchell contributed.", "description": "Republicans are in a full-out revolt against President Trump over his decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, a move broadly seen as putting the lives of Kurdish allies at risk.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_100319upi_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
