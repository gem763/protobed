On cue, the New York Times on Sunday published a \u201cpreviously unreported story\u201d claiming that as a Yale undergraduate at a \u201cdrunken dorm party,\u201d Mr. Kavanaugh had his pants down while friends pushed his genitals \u201cinto the hands of a female student.\u201d The accusation is similar to Deborah Ramirez \u2019s assertion last year in the New Yorker about another drunken Yale party.\n\nWhat has happened since is familiar. No sooner is the \u201cbombshell\u201d story dropped than it starts to look like a dud. It emerges, for example, that this new allegation isn\u2019t really new\u2014the Federal Bureau of Investigation and senators knew about it during Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings\u2014and the Times never spoke to the man who had made the charge, Max Stier.\n\nOn Monday the Times added a humiliating \u201ceditors\u2019 note\u201d admitting its story omitted a crucial fact: The purported victim declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall such an incident. That hasn\u2019t stopped the Democrats\u2019 2020 candidates\u2014including Cory Booker, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Kamala Harris, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg \u2014from calling for the justice\u2019s impeachment.\n\nIn short, the \u201cnew\u201d accusation fails for the same reason the earlier ones did: lack of evidence. Any fair-minded reading of \u201cJustice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court\u201d by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino would lead to the conclusion that the accusations that Mr. Kavanaugh is a sexual predator remain at best unsubstantiated and at worst fabricated. And one way to read Sunday\u2019s Times story is as confirmation that, after a year of investigation, the evidence for Christine Blasey Ford \u2019s allegation of sexual assault is as thin ever.\n\nThe Times story was adapted from a new book on the case by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, both reporters for the paper. But as Ms. Hemingway has written, their book did contain a bombshell: a statement from Ms. Blasey Ford\u2019s high-school friend Leland Keyser, who was pressured to corroborate the claim that Mr. Kavanaugh had tried to rape Ms. Blasey Ford. \u201cI don\u2019t have any confidence in her story,\u201d Ms. Keyser told Ms. Pogrebin and Ms. Kelly.\n\nWith no evidence, the prospects for unseating Justice Kavanaugh are nil. So why the continuing assaults? Because if you throw enough mud, it leaves a stain. Ms. Blasey Ford\u2019s lawyer, Debra Katz, laid this out in an April speech at the University of Baltimore:\n\n\u201cHe will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important. It is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine.\u201d\n\nThese remarks\u2014suggesting that Ms. Katz\u2019s client had motivations other than the truth\u2014surfaced only this month with the release of Ryan Lovelace \u2019s \u201cSearch and Destroy: Inside the Campaign Against Brett Kavanaugh.\u201d Mr. Lovelace\u2019s scoop cries out for follow-up reporting, but the Times won\u2019t touch it.\n\nThis is what Democrats do when they believe there could be a fifth vote to overturn Roe, the 1973 decision that upended the laws of all 50 states to legalize abortion. It\u2019s why Sen. Ted Kennedy in 1987 slandered Judge Robert Bork as a man working for an America where \u201cwomen would be forced into back-alley abortions\u201d and \u201cblacks would sit at segregated lunch counters.\u201d It\u2019s why Judge Clarence Thomas was savaged in 1991, when he faced his own last-minute inquisition over alleged sexual harassment. And it\u2019s why the assassination of Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s character continues.\n\nA new documentary on Justice Thomas\u2019s confirmation, called \u201cHigh-Tech Lynching\u201d and airing Wednesday on FoxNation, reveals why smears can still be effective even if they have been discredited or have failed to derail a nominee. At the time of the Thomas vote, a Gallup poll showed Americans found Mr. Thomas more credible, by a 2-to-1 margin, than his accuser, Anita Hill. But when allies assured him he had been vindicated, Justice Thomas wasn\u2019t buying.\n\nThe new justice told his friend Armstrong Williams that he won confirmation because African-Americans remained loyal to him. In 15 to 20 years, he predicted, \u201cI guarantee you the opinion of me will be unfavorable among that community\u201d because \u201cthe liberal media special-interest groups will stop at nothing.\u201d\n\nAs if to underscore his point, the documentary features Sen. Orrin Hatch saying that Joe Biden \u2014then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2014had told him he didn\u2019t believe Anita Hill. Now that he\u2019s running for president, Mr. Biden has flipped the Thomas narrative, apologizing to the woman he told Mr. Hatch he didn\u2019t believe. For good reason: Most Americans didn\u2019t believe her, either.\n\nIt\u2019s good that folks are exposing the flimsiness of the latest allegations against Justice Kavanaugh. But those making and propagating these charges aren\u2019t interested in getting to the truth. And they ought to be called out as the smear merchants they are.\n\nMs. Katz puts it well: It\u2019s all about the asterisk.\n\nWrite to mcgurn@wsj.com", "description": "Christine Blasey Ford was motivated by politics, her lawyer asserted in April.", "authors": ["William Mcgurn"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107588/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
