The study also found that strict email policy could be harmful to employees with \u201chigh levels of anxiety and neuroticism.\u201d Researchers said some employees feel the need to respond to a \u201cgrowing accumulation of emails\u201d otherwise they can end up feeling overwhelmed.\n\nDr Emma Russell, a senior lecturer in management at the University of Sussex Business school, told the BBC: \u201c[Blanket bans] would be unlikely to be welcomed by employees who prioritise work performance goals and who would prefer to attend work outside of hours to get their tasks completed.\n\n\u201cPeople need to deal with email in the way that suits their personality and their goal priorities in order to feel like they are adequately managing their workload.\u201d\n\nSome companies have already taken steps to ensure their staff are not spending too much time on their emails out of work hours. German carmaker Volkswagen has configured its email systems to only work half an hour before the working day begins to half an hour after it ends, and it is switched off during weekends, to decrease stress among its employees.\n\nIn France, new legislation came into force in 2017 requiring companies with more than 50 workers to draw up a charter setting out the hours when staff are not supposed to send or answer emails. The law was designed to tackle burnout.\n\nBut researchers are now saying a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d email policy won\u2019t work and employers should consider all personalities in the workplace.\n\nAccording to the government\u2019s Health and Safety Executive\u2019s Labour Force Survey, stress, depression or anxiety accounted for 44 per cent of all work-related ill health cases in 2017/18 and 57 per cent of all working days were lost to due to ill health.\n\nChecking our emails outside work makes it difficult to maintain boundaries between our jobs and personal lives. Emma Mamo, Head of Workplace Wellbeing at Mind\n\nEmma Mamo, Head of Workplace Wellbeing at Mind, told Refinery29: \u201cDespite our busy lives, modern technology means that many workers are now contactable around the clock. Checking our emails outside work makes it difficult to maintain boundaries between our jobs and personal lives. Employers and managers need to ensure this relentless email-checking culture doesn\u2019t become the norm.\n\n\u201cThe causes of work-related stress and poor mental health vary from one employee to another. That\u2019s why Wellness Action Plans can help. Drawn up with your manager, these simple tools facilitate conversations about mental health and help identify each of your unique causes of poor mental health, as well as agreed steps to be taken, and can be shared with other colleagues.\u201d\n\nEncouraging a clear work/life balance is imperative, she added, as staff will be \u201chappier, healthier, and more likely to be loyal and productive if their workplace proactively promotes mental wellbeing.\u201d\n\nSome companies, including Mind, have already implemented rules when it comes to viewing emails outside of working hours. The mental health charity actively discourages its employees from sending or reading work-related emails between 8pm and 8am.\n\nDashDividers_1_500x100\n\n24-year-old PR executive Leena Chauhan said joining a company which actively promoted switching off after working hours \u201cchanged her life\u201d.\n\nShe told Refinery29: \u201cOur boss is a very hard work/play hard type of person and she sees that when you leave work, work is over. She says there is no time for emails in your personal time.\n\n\u201cWorking like this has dramatically changed my life. I was so unhappy in my previous roles because I was expected to answer emails day in and day out, and I used to cry all the time because I was conscious that I would be considered bad at my job. I wouldn\u2019t eat or sleep and didn\u2019t care about my appearance. I was severely depressed.\n\n\u201cI lost friends because of my job and because I lacked the time to be able to see them and when I did see them, I was constantly checking my emails and snapping at them. I wasn\u2019t present with my family because I was always on my phone, it was so unhealthy.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "Banning workers from checking their emails outside of office hours can be more harmful to your mental health, a new study has claimed.
