Shah was spotted sitting on the presidential chair inside the committee room of the top government office.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched an investigation on the same day.\n\nIn an appearance on ARY News\u2019 morning show Bakhabar Savera, when asked how she got access to the government office, the artist said she didn\u2019t take any prior permission from the ministry nor anyone took her inside.\n\nThe TikTok star shared she used to visit the Prime Minister\u2019s Secretariat during Nawaz Sharif\u2019s tenure. She has also been to the national assembly.\n\nSources, however, told ARY News that Hareem Shah\u2019s entry record shows that she entered the office by registering herself as a visitor like other people. Her entry into the committee room was made possible through some staffer\u2019s help who has also been identified.\n\nThe TikTok platform, which allows users to create and share videos of 15 seconds, is particularly popular with teenagers.\n\nOwned by Chinese firm ByteDance, TikTok claimed some 500 million users globally last year, making it one of the most popular social apps.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "TikTok star Hareem Shah broke silence for filming a controversial video inside Foreign Ministry on Wednesday for which she received a lot of backlash.", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hareemshha-tiktok.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
