The best business schools always choose a great deal of diversity.\n\n\u201cThe richness of the learning that comes through the way people from different backgrounds think about problem-solving in a business is one of the attributes you get through the full\u2011time program.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEMBA and MBA alumni believe the course has improved their career prospects, but EMBA grads have the edge when it comes to seeing an improvement in the way they perform their current job. Two out of three EMBA graduates believe they can do their current jobs more effectively, against 55 per cent of MBA graduates.\n\nFor Tim Sleep, Australian managing director at executive talent firm Odgers Berndtson, simply undertaking the study says a lot about potential candidates.\n\n\u201cI think any senior executive who has demonstrated continuous learning throughout their career is a positive, and the MBAs and EMBAs both tick that box,\u201d he says. \u201cThe challenge, though, is that it\u2019s becoming an increasingly competitive market.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is people are hiring more and more for mindset over skill set, so there\u2019s more of a focus on, \u2018Are you curious? Do you have a propensity to understand what's going to win in the market tomorrow?\u2019\n\n\u201cAn MBA or EMBA is good, it demonstrates the type of character you have, but you\u2019re rarely hired for the skills that you learn on that course. Are they valuable? Can they be of use? Sure, but that\u2019s more by luck than by design.\u201d", "description": "The high cost of an EMBA is offset by the value of the close networks it offers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3116%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_240%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ff0701fd6a091a8af4f6c1113b0e9027b5f45700", "published_at": "2019-08-19"}
