They included free blowouts for more than 800 customers, videos playing in stores, Hulu branding, and gift boxes featuring hair ties, nail polish and other items assembled by digital lifestyle publisher PopSugar Inc., which initiated the effort.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nPopSugar separately enlisted Barry\u2019s Bootcamp fitness centers in August to promote the new Adidas Boost shoe, putting the shoes on trainers\u2019 feet and displaying them in stores. Barry\u2019s Bootcamp didn\u2019t actually offer the shoes for sale, though.\n\nDrybar, which has also helped hype Netflix Inc. and clothing retailer Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M) stores, aims to do one or two such deals each month, according to Chief Marketing Officer Sarah Hoffmann. The work helps draw attention to Drybar\u2014but brings in money instead of drawing down the marketing budget, she said.\n\n\u201cWe are known for the experience we provide when you come in and get your blowout,\u201c Ms. Hoffmann said. \u201cWe can find ways to elevate that by sharing movies, beverages and other experiences\u2014and partner with movie studios and others to bring these experiences to our customers.\u201d\n\nDrybar has an executive on its marketing team dedicated to such partnerships; Barry\u2019s Bootcamp has two people on its team focused on the projects.\n\nPopSugar is looking to strike ad deals with two more physical chains this year, said Chief Revenue Officer Geoff Schiller. The new pacts, like those with Barry\u2019s Bootcamp and Drybar, will last at least a year, Mr. Schiller said.\n\n\u201cMost bricks-and-mortar retailers don\u2019t have media and advertising revenue streams on their business plans,\u201d Mr. Schiller said. \u201cThis is an opportunity to provide a secondary, incremental revenue stream.\u201d\n\nThe outlets and PopSugar share revenue from the marketers, the companies said. The deals also include the distribution of sponsored videos and other content on PopSugar sites and social channels.\n\nBut Barry\u2019s Bootcamp and Drybar are courting sponsorship deals beyond PopSugar as well.\n\nFor film studio Universal Pictures, Drybar promoted \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets 2\u201d with custom videos in its stores, free blowouts and a \u201cbark bar\u201d for dogs in some locations.\n\nBarry\u2019s Bootcamp, meanwhile, has hosted after-class parties sponsored by tequila brand Don Julio in its studios.\n\n\u201cWhen you consider that communications and marketing teams, in general, have expenses with some measurable [return on investments], it\u2019s nice to get a check from a brand to pull off an experiential activation,\u201d said Vicky Land, vice president of communications and brand strategy for Barry\u2019s Bootcamp. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something we expect to grow.\u201d\n\nPopSugar\u2019s \u201cexperiential\u201d business, which includes its annual event PopSugar Play/Ground and other physical marketing installations such as these deals with Barry\u2019s Bootcamp and Drybar, will account for about 16% of the company\u2019s overall revenue in 2019, said Mr. Schiller. About 22% of PopSugar clients included a physical marketing element in their deals this year, the company said.\n\nWrite to Sahil Patel at SahilPatel@wsj.com", "description": "Barry\u2019s Bootcamp LLC and Drybar Holdings LLC have signed deals with publisher PopSugar Inc. to create in-store marketing programs, from which they will share ad revenue.", "authors": ["Sahil Patel", "Sahil.Patel Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-113626/social"}
