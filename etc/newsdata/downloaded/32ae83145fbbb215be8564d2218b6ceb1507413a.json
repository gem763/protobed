It requires vast amounts of computer processing power and is therefore extremely energy intensive.\n\nRecent estimates suggest that the mining network that supports bitcoin uses as much energy as the entire nation of Ireland and some scientists claim it has put the world on the brink of an environmental disaster.\n\nA 2018 study published in Nature Climate Change found that the carbon emissions produced by the vast energy demands of bitcoin could push global warming above 2C in just two decades.\n\nWhile clean energy mining solutions do exist, such as in Iceland and Norway, the majority of operations are based in China, where coal-generated electricity is cheap.\n\nChina claims to be cracking down on unlicensed cryptocurrency mining operations, however it is not clear what measures are being taken.\n\nIn August, another significant mining operation in the country suffered a catastrophe when the Poolin mining farm was destroyed by floods in the Sichuan province.", "description": "A\u00a0fire at a\u00a0major bitcoin mining farm in China has destroyed millions of dollars worth of equipment, according to reports.
