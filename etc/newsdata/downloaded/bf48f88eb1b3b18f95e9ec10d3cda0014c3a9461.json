Her oxygen levels continued to fall.\n\n\u201cThe doctor told my grandmother he\u2019d never seen anything like it,\u201d Stoyanov said.\n\nThe doctors placed her on a ventilator and took a biopsy of her lungs.\n\nThe meeting Tuesday night included Stoyanov and speakers from the district and Summit County Public Health. Revere schools have taken an aggressive stance against vaping among students, placing detectors in the high school and middle school.\n\nStoyanov first started to notice symptoms on Aug. 27.\n\nJust 10 days earlier, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control had announced it was investigating 94 cases of vape-related illnesses around the country. It was the first mention of the illness most people had heard.\n\nAs Stoyanov\u2019s condition declined and her doctors scrambled for answers, her grandfather suggested she tell them about her vaping. She spent 16 days in the hospital.\n\nStoyanov was confident vaping wasn\u2019t the cause, but she told doctors she had smoked e-cigarettes and used THC cartridges.\n\n\u201cI was the first case they had seen,\u201d she said.\n\nThings began to make sense.\n\nStoyanov remained on a respirator and doctors started to give her steroids to help her damaged lungs repair.\n\nStoyanov still isn\u2019t sure what particular cartridge or e-cigarette caused her illness. But she has some clues.\n\nDoctors told her she had vaped vitamin E acetate into her lungs. Many of the now 1,479 cases have that in common. Bootleg THC cartridges are another common denominator.\n\n\u201cI thought I could tell the real from the fake,\u201d Stoyanov said. \u201cYou think you can trust where you\u2019re getting them, but you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAs Stoyanov recovered, she underwent breathing therapy and a multitude of tests.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like needles,\u201d she said. \u201cI was pricked with needles five or six times a day.\u201d\n\nWhen her nurse, whose children attend Revere Local Schools, asked her to speak, Stoyanov said yes.\n\nShe had trouble walking again and had to do rehab work.\n\nTuesday, she told her story, talking calmly about what she had been through.\n\nShe said she may have long-term damage to her lungs, but the medical community isn\u2019t sure, yet. Only time will tell.\n\nHer message to young and old at the meeting: Don\u2019t vape.\n\nTo date, 33 people have died of the vape-related illness, according to CDC reports.\n\nStoyanov was almost one of the first.\n\nWhen her doctor talked to Stoyanov\u2019s grandmother, he said as much.\n\n\u201cHe told her they had come very close to losing me,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Akron Beacon Journal, http://www.ohio.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A 21-year-old Canton woman who nearly died from a vaping illness brought her story to Revere High School on Tuesday night before a small but engaged audience.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Alan Ashworth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/25/exchange-vaping-womans_ordeal_11785_c0-101-1800-1151_s1200x700.jpg?81f11ee552a9106aeed5f77e9dd95ce0e451b003", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
