Mandatory Credit: Steve Flynn-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Arians said when asked if Winston would be replaced. \u201cI look at the reasons why. What happened? If it happens again, yeah, it\u2019ll concern the hell out of me.\u201d\n\nTampa Bay fell to 2-4 with the 37-26 \u201chome\u201d loss to Carolina. Winston has thrown 10 interceptions for the season, and his 68 career picks and 87 turnovers are the most of any quarterback since 2015.\n\nMore QB news\n\n\u2014Panthers quarterback Cam Newton is expected to be practicing when Carolina returns from this week\u2019s bye, ESPN reported. Kyle Allen is 4-0 as the starter this season in Newton\u2019s absence and has yet to throw an interception, leaving the team with a potentially huge decision.\n\n\u2014Cleveland\u2019s Baker Mayfield, who went to the locker room with a hip injury in the third quarter but returned in his team\u2019s loss to the Seattle Seahawks, \u201cwill be fine,\u201d Browns coach Freddie Kitchens told reporters. The Browns have a bye this week.\n\n\u2014Tennessee Titans coach Mike Vrabel told reporters that he needs more time to decide who will start at quarterback in Week 7, but he added that he plans to make a decision in time to inform his team Tuesday if it will be Marcus Mariota or Ryan Tannehill.\n\n\u2014Miami Dolphins coach Brian Flores said that Josh Rosen remains his starting quarterback despite being benched in a loss to the Washington Redskins, but he did not close the door on giving the job back to veteran Ryan Fitzpatrick at some point.\n\nSeason-ending injuries\n\n\u2014Seattle coach Pete Carroll told reporters he suspects second-year tight end Will Dissly will be lost for the season after sustaining an Achilles injury against Cleveland. Dissly has 23 catches for 262 yards and a team-high four touchdown receptions.\n\n\u2014The Rams announced that starting guard Joseph Noteboom will miss the rest of the season after tearing the ACL and MCL in his right knee during Los Angeles\u2019 20-7 home loss to the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n\u2014Pittsburgh defensive end Stephon Tuitt will undergo season-ending surgery for a pectoral tear sustained Sunday night against the Los Angeles Chargers, ESPN\u2019s Chris Mortensen reported.\n\nMore injury updates\n\n\u2014The Rams places starting cornerback Aqib Talib on injured reserve with fractured ribs, meaning he is eligible to return to action no earlier than Dec. 15 game against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n\u2014Chicago placed guard Kyle Long on injured reserve because of a hip injury, the fourth straight season in which he has landed on injured reserve. It is possible that Long will miss the rest of the season.\n\n\u2014Cowboys wide receiver Amari Cooper, who left Sunday\u2019s loss to the New York Jets in the first quarter, has a thigh bruise that should not be a long-term issue, NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport reported. If Cooper cannot play against Philadelphia next weekend, he will get extended rest with Dallas on a bye in Week 8.\n\n\u2014Houston Texans starting right tackle Tytus Howard sprained the MCL in his left knee in a victory over Kansas City and reportedly expected to miss several weeks. However, he is expected to avoid surgery, and he should return at some point this season.\n\nComings and goings\n\n\u2014Tom Brady said on his weekly radio appearance he won\u2019t ask tight end Rob Gronkowski to end his retirement to return to New England. Gronkowski, 30, hasn\u2019t filed his retirement papers yet, and team owner Robert Kraft told NFL Network last week that he can \u201cpray and hope\u201d that Gronkowski will decide to play again. Also, the Patriots are reportedly expected to re-sign veteran tight end Ben Watson after releasing him last week.\n\n\u2014Veteran linebacker Zach Brown, who last week made disparaging remarks about Minnesota quarterback Kirk Cousins before Cousins and the Vikings pounded the Eagles on Sunday, was released on Monday. After the game, Brown was reluctant to talk about Cousins, other than, \u201cHe did a great job today. He played good, you know? Hats off to him.\u201d\n\n\u2014The Indianapolis Colts announced that All-Pro linebacker Darius Leonard and defensive back Clayton Geathers cleared concussion protocol and returned to practice.\n\n\u2014Veteran Arizona Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson announced his return from a six-game suspension for violating the league\u2019s performance-enhancing drugs policy with a tweet: \u201cGOING TO WORK!!!!\u201d ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported Sunday that at least three teams had called Arizona to inquire about Peterson\u2019s availability.\n\n\u2014Titans first-round draft pick Jeffery Simmons is expected to begin practicing for the first time this week. The defensive tackle has been sidelined since tearing his left ACL in February.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians said Monday that Jameis Winston will remain his team's starting quarterback despite throwing a career-worst five interceptions Sunday in a loss to the Carolina Panthers in London.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1440974945&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E05A-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
