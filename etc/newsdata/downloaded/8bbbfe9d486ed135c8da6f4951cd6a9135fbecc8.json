Larry Hogan writing book about his tenure, cancer fight", "language": "en", "text": "The book will be co-written with Ellis Henican, a syndicated columnist and cable news contributor. Henican already has co-authored several books, including the memoirs of former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, a close friend of Hogan, and former Florida governor Charlie Crist.\n\nAD\n\nEach was viewed \u2014 at one point or another \u2014 as rising a star in the Republican Party.\n\nSuch books are often the precursor to bid for higher office, though Hogan has indicated no such plans. Hogan, who twice won election in a state dominated by Democratic voters, is term-limited.\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this year, he seriously considered challenging President Trump in the Republican primaries. He ultimately declined, disappointing the president\u2019s Republican critics who had been wooing Hogan to run.\n\nThe governor pledged to remain part of the national conversation about the future of the GOP, saying he would stay close to mainstream donors and the party power structure.\n\nAD\n\nSince then he has expanded his national profile through his work as chair of the National Governors Association and launched an advocacy group called An America United, which he said would work to rally support around nonpartisan priorities such as infrastructure.\n\nThe promotional materials for Hogan\u2019s book said it \u201crecounts the heartwarming journey of how he overcame the odds, from winning a long-shot election for governor to surviving non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and offers bold, open-minded answers to remedy today\u2019s bleak politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a completely open look at my whole life,\u201d Hogan told the Baltimore Sun. \u201cPeople are going to read it and say, \u2018I did not know that about the governor.\u2019 Hopefully it will be an interesting read.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The Maryland governor\u2019s book, \u201cStill Standing,\u201d is expected to be released in June.", "authors": ["Erin Cox", "Local Reporter Covering Maryland State Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-b9-hqKAsbrf0IeSe-0MQwuofwc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LDES7PVP3QI6TIGJNUWXQGHT3I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
