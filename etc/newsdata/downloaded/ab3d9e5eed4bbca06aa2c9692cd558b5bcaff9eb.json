Here's how they're trying to fix it.", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 There aren\u2019t many national polls in which former Vice President Joe Biden is in danger of being eclipsed by entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Except when it comes to support from young voters.\n\nIndeed, the internet-friendly, dark-horse candidate recently netted 8 percent support from voters 18-34 years old according to a recent Quinnipiac poll \u2014 and Biden was only two points ahead. Both, however, were far behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who netted 31 and 25 points respectively.\n\nYoung voters veering left in this pack of primary challengers is nothing new; back in June, polling of young voters showed Warren as their No. 1 pick, with Sanders following close behind. Biden tied for fourth place with California Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\nCritics of youth turnout often harp on the fact that young voters don\u2019t turn out. Their gripe has been grounded in some truth, but current trend lines reflect a far more motivated electorate. Millennial and Gen Z voters showed up in record numbers in the 2018 midterms, with a combined 30.6 million ballots, a quarter of midterm totals. While there\u2019s not an abundance of polling on the predicted turnout of Gen Z and millennials in 2020 (though Pew estimates they\u2019ll make up 10 percent of eligible voters), young voters have been keeping a close eye on the race.\n\nThe same Quinnipiac poll indicates that a combined 75 percent of 18- to 34-year-old respondents have been paying either \u201ca lot\u201d or \u201csome\u201d attention to the race, passing the combined enthusiasm for the next eldest subset of voters.\n\n\n\nBiden with supporters in Clear Lake, Iowa.

The campaign who pays attention this time around could see the same gains.\u201d\n\nBut insurgency is built on, if anything, ideas. And the newest crop of young voters are motivated by bold and hyperliberal solutions to health care access, racism, income inequality and immigration. Campaigns not directly addressing these issues might render themselves unpopular said Abby Kiesa, director of impact at the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), an arm of Tufts University dedicated to studying the political life of young people in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIf we see some differentiation between Biden and Warren and Sanders, it might very well be because of those issues and the importance that younger generations put on issues over party,\u201d said Kiesa.\n\nYoung voters seem more attracted to progressive candidates who speak \u201creally explicitly about racism and about inequality\u201d said Kiesa, and often find themselves left out of mainstream political conversation \u201cbecause in every election cycle we see that campaigns obviously target people who they think are going to vote and vote for them. And so that leaves a whole bunch of young people out.\u201d\n\nBut the Biden campaign doesn\u2019t find their own standing among young voters concerning, at least compared to their considerably higher national averages.\n\n\u201cWe feel really good about what the average is, about the young voters that turn out to his events in the first four,\u201d deputy campaign manager Pete Kavanaugh said, referring to Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any cause for concern. You\u2019re always going to have some changes, obviously, across demographics, but we still think he appeals to young people.\u201d\n\n\n\nKavanaugh added that their team made considerable efforts to focus on college campuses, and the campaign has positioned paid staff in early voting states to ensure that their youth mobilization results in high primary returns. According to Team Biden, Iowa\u2019s youth reach director will have five more full-time campus organizers aim to expand Students for Biden across the state, and a key component of South Carolina\u2019s youth vote director is to engage students at in-state historically black colleges and universities.", "description": "There aren\u2019t many national polls in which Joe Biden is in danger of being eclipsed by entrepreneur Andrew Yang.
