He had arrived at Heathrow airport, packed and ready for the 14-hour slog back to Phnom Penh, and at that point another season at the Cambodian club Svay Rieng felt like a trade-off he could just about stomach. The football there offered few real prospects but he had enjoyed the lifestyle and, after such an uncertain year and a half since leaving Southampton, surely his happiness was the most important thing.\n\nNext Generation: after five years, how has our first full class of picks fared? Read more\n\nBut something did not quite feel right. Doubts had crept in during three weeks back home; \u201cI want to progress in my career\u201d was a thought he could not shake and it grew stronger as he sat in the terminal, the vision of the bumpy, sandy pitches and iffy facilities in south-east Asia looking less appealing by the minute. He rang his agent, Nick Mccreery; then rang him again and again. \u201cShould I get that on that plane?\u201d was the recurring question and when the answer came it was the one that, deep down, he had wanted to hear.\n\nNow Willard is on his post-season break after eight months spent with the Icelandic second division club Vikingur Olafsvik, which feels a world away from the steam and bustle of his old home. \u201cIt\u2019s only got just under 1,000 people but, you know what, I like it,\u201d he says of the eponymous village, out on a limb in Iceland\u2019s far west, where he has quietly begun getting things back on track. \u201cIt\u2019s a good place just to concentrate on your football, no distractions, and that\u2019s why I went there. It\u2019s been great to be part of and I\u2019ve enjoyed every game. Because I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m progressing and showing it on the pitch.\u201d\n\nWillard scored 12 times in 22 league games last season, an impressive record for a winger, and was named in the division\u2019s team of the season. There is no kidding: this is not what he had imagined five years ago when, on his 17th birthday, he signed professional terms with the Saints after showing the promise that would earn him a place on the Guardian\u2019s inaugural Next Generation list that year. But he feels he is regaining the momentum that was crudely halted in the manner so many young players endure each year.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see it coming to be honest,\u201d he says of the day in May 2017 when the Premier League club cut him adrift. He was no longer a regular in the Under-23s, for whom he had debuted at 16, but he felt Claude Puel, the senior team\u2019s manager at the time, had taken a liking to him. \u201cIt was quite strange, but that\u2019s just how it is. The more I wasn\u2019t playing for the Under-23s I was thinking \u2018maybe it\u2019s not going to work out\u2019 but then the next day I\u2019d be training with the first team and the manager would be talking to me. So it was a bit of a shock.\u201d\n\nHe is quick to stress that he bears no grudges. Martin Hunter, who coached Southampton\u2019s second string at the time, preferred other wide players but Willard says the pair got on well. \u201cIt\u2019s a sport full of opinions, and you can only try and change someone\u2019s,\u201d he says. \u201cI did what I could do.\u201d\n\nThe problem, and perhaps the most important issue facing the majority of academy products at top-flight clubs today, was what came next. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what direction to go in after I left,\u201d he says. \u201cThe agent I had at the time wasn\u2019t giving me the advice I needed and I had nowhere to go, really. I had in my head that I was going to prove Southampton wrong and get back where I need to be, but I didn\u2019t know what to do so it was hard.\u201d\n\nAlmost a year of bobbing around in non-league with Maidstone, Eastbourne and Welling ensued. For a 20 year-old who had never been out on loan, or experienced much beyond the pristine surfaces and intense technical drills at top-level training grounds, the experience was \u201cbrutal, a completely different game, you just can\u2019t compare the two\u201d. He knew he could quickly be swallowed up in the remorseless to-and-fro so found a move to the Swedish lower leagues with IFK H\u00e4ssleholm. That was, on the bright side, an early chance to fulfil his ambition of playing overseas but the team only trained three times a week and when Svay Rieng\u2019s Irish manager, Conor Nestor, called in the summer of 2018 he decided to gamble on the complete change of scene.\n\nIt has all posed a different mental challenge to the one that, trailed as a prodigy at Southampton, he now realises he found difficult to handle. \u201cAt the time I was young and I had a lot of pressure on me,\u201d he says. \u201cI was the first person in my age group to sign professionally and the club had put a lot into me. I felt I had a lot to give back but perhaps it got to me. You\u2019re 16 and about to sign that contract, thinking \u2018I\u2019m going to be a star here and break into the first team\u2019. But obviously it\u2019s not as easy as that and when I got to 18 or 19 it was tough, I struggled. My family were so supportive but other people around me were negative and it wasn\u2019t the best. I was listening to the wrong people.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch Harley Willard in action.\n\nHe thinks that, at that stage of a nascent career, environmental factors can be the difference between academy products thriving and, in some cases, dropping out of football altogether. \u201cWhen you\u2019re happy, confident and everything around you is good, you play your best football,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re wanting to learn and progress, wanting to succeed so badly, and it happens to you because people can see it and they help you more. You get one chance, and if you take it then it could be you.\u201d\n\nThe example of Marcus Rashford, another of the 2014 Next Generation picks, is particularly pertinent to Willard. The pair met while he was on trial at Manchester United, shortly before joining Southampton from Arsenal\u2019s youth setup in 2013. They became friendly, hanging out together in the Trafford Centre on occasion, and he believes the England forward\u2019s meteoric rise is proof of what can happen when that opportunity is seized.\n\n\u201cIt looked like we were both going down the same route: youth team, reserve team, first team,\u201d he says. \u201cHe took his chance and now look at him. When you have that happiness, confidence and good people around you the only way is up.\u201d\n\nFor Willard, those elements are now back in place. He does not rule out returning to Olafsvik, the place that brought the joy back, but his return from the brink has not gone unnoticed. Clubs in Iceland\u2019s top flight would take him but there has been interest from Scandinavia and the Dutch second division, too. The sense, at last, is that the tide has turned.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Willard (left) in action for Southampton against Kyle Walker-Peters of Tottenham Hotspur during a Premier League 2 match on September 23, 2016.

But when I look back now I\u2019m happy I went through the struggle and think that was the making of me, going through the bad times and knowing things can\u2019t get much worse than they were then. Now I\u2019m on the way up, starting to get a bit of success, and I know what I need to do.\u201d\n\nThe penny appears to have dropped, to some extent, for young English footballers and their representatives that foreign leagues are a logical next step from the academy education. Willard feels his technique has been allowed to shine in Iceland and is, unsurprisingly, eager to champion moving abroad as an option for others seeking a second chance today.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d advise it for anyone if they get released or things don\u2019t work out,\u201d he says. \u201cI think a lot of players will succeed with it. Hopefully things work first time but, if not, then don\u2019t give up because there\u2019s always a path for you.\u201d\n\nEven if it took a dramatic change of heart before passport control, Willard\u2019s now seems awash with possibility once again.", "description": "The winger, who was part of the Guardian\u2019s first Next Generation in 2014, talks about rebuilding his career after being released by Southampton", "authors": ["Nick Ames"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c819338b2fa0ef4070415194a5758f8f23956bb7/0_275_4827_2896/master/4827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c1b272692202e305afeb4c76493f209d", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
