[Photo/Xinhua]\n\nNext year, China will celebrate the end of poverty. This will mark the accomplishment of over 40 years of continuous and consistent efforts, policies, and programs aimed at lifting the whole rural population in China out of poverty.\n\nWhile China will rightly celebrate the achievement, the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-around way, xi\u01ceo k\u0101ng sh\u00e8 hu\u00ec, is far from being completed.\n\nThere are five challenges that China will still need to face after 2020.\n\nFrom absolute to relative poverty\n\nBy 2020, it is expected that no one in China will live in absolute poverty under the country's present poverty line. However, according to the Commission on Global Poverty, if a $3.2 per day poverty line is adopted (the typical poverty line in lower-middle-income countries), 96 million people\uff0dor 7 percent of the population\uff0dwould still live below this threshold in China. If a poverty line of $5.5 per day is adopted (the typical poverty line in upper-middle-income countries), 373 million people\uff0dor 27 percent of the population\uff0dwould still live in poverty. This represents a significant portion of the population.\n\nBringing these people above these thresholds represents the first challenge for China in the years after 2020.\n\nShock-proofing achievements\n\nAlthough the people that were living below the poverty line before 2020 will be brought out of poverty by 2020, they will still remain vulnerable to shocks. Serious diseases or other unforeseen events, the loss of a job or long periods of unemployment, the costs of children's education, unfavourable weather events or fluctuations in price commodities\uff0dparticularly for those households engaged in agriculture, may easily push this segment of the population back into poverty. Although above the poverty line, these people are at risk of falling back into poverty.\n\nSimilarly, those people that were just above the poverty line before 2020, and as such were not the target of the extensive poverty reduction programs that were implemented in the country in the past years, may be equally vulnerable to the same shocks.\n\nMaking these two categories of people\uff0dthose that were below, and those that were just above the poverty line\uff0dmore resilient to shocks, ensuring that those that were out of poverty prior to 2020 remain out of poverty, and preventing those that were brought out of poverty from falling back into poverty\uff0dor, in other words, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the poverty reduction achievements\uff0dis the second challenge that the country will need to deal with in the next few years.\n\nReducing inequalities\n\nAlthough absolute poverty will be eliminated, inequality (between urban and rural areas, between the western and coastal provinces and\uff0dwithin the same province\uff0dbetween the better-off and worst-off counties, and between different groups within the society\uff0dwith women, the elderly, the children, and ethnic minorities being the most vulnerable groups) will still persist after 2020.\n\nDespite the rapid growth of farmers' incomes, according to last year's Statistics Bulletin on National Economic and Social Development, the average urban income is still almost three-times higher than the average rural income. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the average income in the eastern region of China is still almost two-times higher than in the western region, and the average income in the \"nationally defined poor counties\" is more than 30 percent lower than the average national rural income. Data from the Chinese Household Income Project suggest that average income of women is 20 percent lower than that of men.\n\nAlthough the GINI coefficient in China (the coefficient that measures inequality in a society) has been decreasing since 2010, according to the World Bank, suggesting some improvements as far as equality in the society is concerned, its value remains relatively high\uff0dconfirming that inequality remains a major issue in China today.\n\nSignificantly reducing these inequalities will be the third challenge for China after 2020.\n\nEasing financial burden\n\nThe financial burden of poverty reduction efforts on public finance has been tremendous.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Finance, it is estimated that the government has spent over 1 trillion yuan on poverty reduction programs over the past 3 years, and that the percentage of fiscal expenditure for poverty reduction reached 2.2 percent in 2018(about half of the annual military expenditure).\n\nThis was certainly justified by the pursuit of the highest social goal\uff0dbut it made poverty reduction extremely demanding on public resources. A similar effort is certainly not sustainable over time.\n\nMaking poverty reduction achievements financially sustainable, that is to say sustainable without heavily depending on the injection of public resources, is the fourth challenge for China after 2020.\n\nDeveloping rural areas\n\nLast, addressing rural poverty and providing the entire rural population with the minimum income necessary to meet the minimum living requirements was a moral imperative for China. However, addressing rural poverty should not be the ultimate goal of a society.\n\nThe next challenge for China is to further develop the rural areas, both economically and socially, making them attractive for people to live in.\n\nThis should be the medium-to long-term objective that Chinese society should set in 2020 for the decades to come.\n\nAddressing extreme poverty is the first, important step toward achieving a moderately prosperous society\uff0dbut it is not the last. A society that is not poor is not necessarily wealthy. The path toward a moderately prosperous society is still long, and several challenges still have to be addressed in order to fulfill the Chinese dream. However, the direction is clear, and so are the challenges ahead. With vision, commitment and determination there is no doubt China will succeed in achieving that goal, as it succeeded in eradicating poverty.\n\nThe author is country director and representative for China, International Fund for Agricultural Development.
