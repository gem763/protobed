The Medium/Large band was already attached, and I changed out the Medium/Large with the Small/Medium band that Apple also included with the watch.\n\nHere's how you can swap out your Apple Watch band for another band:\n\nCheck out the products mentioned in this article:\n\nHow to change your Apple Watch band\n\n\n\n1. Turn over your Apple Watch so that its screen faces down.\n\n2. Find the band release buttons. There's one for the top band and one for the bottom. They are thin oval buttons at the very top and bottom of the back side of the watch.\n\n3. Press the band release button and, as you're pressing, slide the band across in either direction to remove it.\n\nHold the band release button and slide that side's band out of place.

Kerry Wan/Business Insider\n\nHow to correctly fasten your Apple Watch band\n\n1. Make sure it fits closely (but not uncomfortably) against your wrist. The watch needs to be in contact with your skin to allow the sensors to do their job and optimize watch performance.\n\n2. Apple recommends tightening your Apple Watch during workouts (for more accurate reads and safety, presumably), and loosening the band post-workout.\n\n3. Wear your Apple Watch the way you'd traditionally wear a watch. Apple notes that the sensors only work when the watch is worn on top of your wrist.\n\nWhich bands work with Apple Watch, and where to find them\n\nWhether you have a 1st generation Apple Watch, the latest Series 4, or anything in between, you can use an Apple Watch band designed for any of these models \u2014 as long as it corresponds to the case size (height) of your watch.\n\nApple notes that bands for 38mm and 40mm are compatible and work interchangeably, and the same goes for 42mm and 44mm cases.\n\nNo Apple Watch band will fit on every watch, but some sizes will match. Kerry Wan/Business Insider\n\nWhile Apple offers a variety of in-house bands that you can purchase from its site, you can also equip your Apple Watch with third-party bands, which can cost significantly less than Apple's bands.\n\nCheck out the video version of this article on YouTube:\n\nRelated coverage from How To Do Everything: Tech:", "description": "Learning how to change your Apple Watch band by replacing it with a new band is any easy way to customize your device to match your style.", "authors": ["Abigail Abesamis"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d14e3cbdaa9540e284ab163?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
