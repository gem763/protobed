(AP) - How much freedom will Aaron Rodgers have in coach Matt LaFleur\u2019s offense? Will he be able to change plays at the line of scrimmage?\n\nLaFleur said Monday that Rodgers will have a \u201cgreen light\u201d to change plays in order to put the offense in the best position to succeed.\n\nAs the Rodgers audible-related questions continued Tuesday, LaFleur, visibly annoyed, looked to put an end to all the chatter.\n\n\u201cYou guys just will not stop with this audible thing,\u201d the first-year coach said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. What do you guys want me to say?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had adjustments within our plays, it\u2019s just we called it something different,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cAnd the fact that I didn\u2019t call it an audible, everyone\u2019s running wild with it. It\u2019s comical to me. But like I\u2019ve said, I feel good with what we\u2019ve got in our plan, how we\u2019ve gotten to this point and I\u2019m confident that he\u2019s got a total command and control of what we\u2019re trying to get done.\u201d\n\nThe questions will likely be answered on the field Thursday night when LaFleur, Rodgers and the Packers open the regular season in Chicago.\n\nRodgers will face the same defense that forced him out of the game and into the locker room in the second quarter of the season opener last season.\n\nAfter having his left knee evaluated, the two-time MVP returned in the second half and threw three touchdown passes to help the Packers overcame a 20-point deficit in a thrilling 24-23 win at Lambeau Field.\n\n\u201cThat was an exciting game, one that ranks up there for me in all-time games and best experiences on the field,\u201d Rodgers said on Sunday.\n\nBut that was last year.\n\nThis is a new year and a new offense.\n\n\u201cI think everybody needs to understand this is going to be the first iteration of our offense and because it\u2019s a new scheme and there are new pieces, this is going to grow from this point,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI\u2019m excited about the stuff we have in and the stuff we\u2019ve been working on in camp. There\u2019s going to be even more. I think that\u2019s the exciting part.\u201d\n\nThe crucial part for the Packers will be keeping Rodgers upright. Linebacker Khalil Mack and the Bears\u2019 defense had four sacks in last season\u2019s opener and another five when the teams squared off again in Week 15.\n\n\u201cAnd the thing is, it\u2019s not just Mack,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a couple guys that are like that. That\u2019s what makes it so challenging. You focus on one guy and the next thing you know, you\u2019ve got (linebacker Leonard) Floyd or (defensive tackle Akiem) Hicks in your backfield as well. They\u2019ve got a lot of good pieces across their defense that you have to account for on each and every play.\u201d\n\nChicago defeated Green Bay 24-17 in the December 2018 matchup and clinched the NFC North.\n\nThe Bears held Rodgers without a touchdown pass and put an end to his NFL-record streak without an interception in the rematch. Rodgers\u2018 had thrown 402 passes before getting picked off by safety Eddie Jackson.\n\n\u201cObviously it starts up front, being able to protect and try and control the line of scrimmage and slow those guys down,\u201d Rodgers said.\n\n\u201cObviously they added a great young linebacker to the mix last year in (Roquan) Smith, they\u2019ve got a couple of Alabama boys in the back end with Eddie and now (safety) Ha Ha (Clinton-Dix) and very solid, solid corners who are veteran players now and we\u2019ve played against them for a number of years now.\u201d\n\nChicago signed Clinton-Dix to a one-year deal in March after the former Pro Bowler spent his first four-plus seasons as Rodgers\u2018 teammate. Rodgers said the Bears having Clinton-Dix will definitely add a new wrinkle to the rivalry.\n\n\u201cHe was a lot of fun to be in the locker room with, to go to battle with, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s talking about different things with my eye control or eye movement or pocket movement - different things that I like to do,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be fun to play against him.\u201d\n\nNOTES: The Packers placed TE Jace Sternberger on injured reserve. Sternberger had an ankle injury and was seen walking through the locker room on Tuesday with a boot on his left foot. \u2026 ILB Oren Burks (chest) and WR Darrius Shepherd (hamstring) did not participate in practice on Tuesday. \u2026 CB Ka\u2019dar Hollman (neck) remained in a red, no-contact jersey and was limited. CB Tramon Williams (knee) was also limited.\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "How much freedom will Aaron Rodgers have in coach Matt LaFleur's offense?
