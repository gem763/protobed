He said his administration \u201cwill begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately.\u201d\n\nThe striking reversal raises further doubts about Mulvaney\u2019s future in the chief of staff job. He held a news conference Thursday announcing the choice of Doral for the summit. He insisted his staff had concluded it was \u201cfar and away the best physical facility.\u201d Mulvaney said the White House reached that determination after visiting 10 sites across the country.\n\nDays after being the face of the selection, Mulvaney again held a national stage, but this time said: \u201cI think it\u2019s the right decision to change.\u201d\n\nAt the news conference Thursday, Mulvaney acknowledged a quid pro quo was at work when Trump held up U.S. aid to Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine\u2019s investigation of Democrats and the 2016 elections. Mulvaney later claimed his comments had been misconstrued, but not before drawing the ire of the president and frustration from other senior aides.\n\nTrump had been the first administration official to publicly float the selection of his property to host the summit when in August he mentioned it was on the shortlist and praised its facilities and close proximity to Miami\u2019s international airport.\n\nHis comments, more than a month before the announcement, drew instant criticism from good-governance groups and Democrats, who said it raised concerns that Trump was using the White House to boost his personal finances\n\nThe vociferous criticism only intensified with Thursday\u2019s announcement, drawing wide condemnation from Democrats and even some Republicans. Trump insisted he would host the summit at cost, though he refused to disclose financial details. The annual heads-of-state gathering would at minimum have provided goodwill value to his property.\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to an emailed request Friday seeking details on how it would calculate its charges to the federal government, such as whether it would include the full cost of upgrades to buildings that could benefit the resort for years to come.\n\nNoah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said Trump\u2019s reversal Saturday \u201cis a bow to reality, but does not change how astonishing it was that a president ever thought this was appropriate, or that it was something he could get away with.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Mulvaney had discounted Camp David, the government-owned presidential retreat, as the site for the summit, claiming, \u201cI understand the folks who participated in it hated it and thought it was a miserable place to have the G-7.\u201d He added that it was too small and remote for the international summit.\n\nMulvaney listed more than a half dozen states visited in the screening, including Tennessee, North Carolina, Hawaii and Utah. But convention, economic development and tourism officials in several of those states said they were unaware of any visits, and some didn\u2019t even know their state was in the running.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office in Hawaii said a \u201cgeneral search\u201d had been done, but didn\u2019t think any specific site had been considered. In Utah, where Mulvaney said two places had made a final list of four sites, the governor\u2019s office said it was not aware any venue there was under serious consideration.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Bernard Condon in New York contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump dropped plans to hold an international summit at his Doral resort in Florida after realizing \"it looks lousy\" to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/20/b3cb5e_trump-doral-16964-2017-file-image-video-shows-trump-national-doral-in-doral-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
