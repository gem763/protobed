The resolution recognizes the role Kurdish allies have played in the fight against the Islamic State, condemns the Turkish incursion in Syria and asks Trump to reconsider his invitation to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to visit the White House.\n\nMcConnell added that he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by media reports that the Trump administration is considering keeping a military presence Syria to maintain pressure on ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow them to establish safe havens and solidify their networks,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cJust about every place that President Trump tried to lead from behind provides reminders that there are certain kinds of leadership only America can contribute.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s move to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria earlier this month incited rare GOP revolt against his administration. McConnell penned an op-ed in the Washington Post Friday calling the decision a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d \u2013 though he did not mention Trump by name -- while Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has introduced new sanctions on Turkey with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.). The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will also hold a hearing Tuesday afternoon with James Jeffrey, the State Department's special representative for Syria engagement.\n\nMcConnell said Tuesday that while he was open to the Senate considering sanctions, he urged caution in using \u201cthe same tools against a democratic NATO ally that we would against the worst rogue states.\u201d\n\nDespite McConnell\u2019s resolution, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) reiterated his calls Tuesday for McConnell to take up the House resolution, which passed with significant support from House Republicans.\n\n\u201cI wish our colleagues would show the same courage,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIf the House resolution is tough enough for House Republican leadership, surely it\u2019s good enough for the majority of Senate Republicans.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/68/1d/13d8a1f34898bf3418a547c11de0/191022-mitch-mcconnell-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
