So what went wrong?\n\nIt was certainly not a victory but neither was it a clear defeat for the Conservatives on election night.\n\nThe country elected a Liberal minority government with a projected 155 seats out of 338. The Conservatives got 122, according to the CBC election tracker.\n\nBut the Conservatives edged out the Liberals in the popular vote - 34.5% to 33%.\n\n\"Let's remember this feeling, coming close but falling just short,\" Conservative leader Andrew Scheer told supporters in Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe party made some gains, sweeping the prairies and picking up seats in New Brunswick, Ontario and British Columbia. That leaves the Conservatives with 24 more seats now than they had in 2015.\n\nThere was a point in the campaign when it seemed they would win.\n\nWith scandals like SNC-Lavalin and revelations about blackface haunting him, Mr Trudeau had never been weaker. Days before the election, some polls projected the Conservatives would win the most seats.\n\nNow the party will be outflanked on the left.\n\nThe New Democratic Party, with 25 seats, has said it will not work with the Conservatives.\n\nAnd the Green Party, with three seats, refuses to support any oil or gas pipelines - key issues for many in the west, where oil and gas industries make up a large part of the economy.\n\nIt is a no-win scenario for many, says Adrienne Ivy, a rancher from Saskatchewan who attended the Conservatives' viewing party on election night.\n\n\"The idea of a minority government is a little unsettling for everyone since it's the unknown,\" she said.\n\n\"Western Canada is feeling extremely alienated already, and the results we're seeing today only further that to a higher degree.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"Canadians voted in favour of a progressive agenda\" - Justin Trudeau's victory speech\n\nThe loss comes at a time when the Conservative Party is trying to prove that a centre-right party can govern, as populist or right-wing parties win power elsewhere.\n\nMr Scheer favoured economic arguments over ideological ones, campaigning on the promise of lower taxes and balancing the budget but avoiding divisive social issues.\n\nAlthough as a devout Roman Catholic he opposes gay marriage and abortion personally, he says he would not bring the issues to a vote if the Conservatives were in power.\n\nMost notably, in comparison with his conservative foreign counterparts, Mr Scheer has avoided the kind of anti-immigrant rhetoric that propelled the rise of Donald Trump in the US.\n\nDevinder Shory, a former MP from Calgary, Alberta, who was born in India, says there is no reason why immigrants should not be part of a Canadian conservative movement.\n\n\"I believe the Canadian values and all the ethnic values, the new immigrant values are Conservative values,\" he said. \"We believe in working hard and lowering taxes.\n\nWhen then-Conservative MP Maxime Bernier criticised Canada's \"extreme multiculturalism\", Mr Scheer censored him, leading Mr Bernier to quit the party to form the People's Party of Canada.\n\nThat gamble did not pan out for Mr Bernier, who lost his seat and failed to get a single candidate elected.\n\nBut that does not mean there is no populist movement in Canada.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How important is bilingualism on the campaign trail?\n\nIn Ontario, the Conservative provincial government of Doug Ford toppled a long-held Liberal government with promises to repeal progressive sex education in public schools, cut the fat in government and stem the tide of refugees crossing at the US border.\n\nMr Scheer did not go to Mr Ford for provincial campaign support, which many speculated was because he was afraid Mr Ford's message would scare moderate voters.\n\nBut there are voters in the party who might like to see some of his style make its way back.\n\n\"I'm tired of being called names just because I disagree with uncontrolled borders,\" says mother Melanie Burns, who recently moved from Ontario to Saskatchewan to raise her four-year-old in a more conservative province.\n\nNow the party must decide how much to listen to people like Melanie and Mr Ford, or whether the centre can hold.", "description": "The Conservative Party have failed to unseat Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party from power.
