The child is crying and he tries to calm her by giving her small sips of water.\n\n\"Today, my daughter is constantly vomiting. I brought her here hoping someone would see her. I don't know if it is cholera or an infection,\" he said.\n\n\"We are very poor. Before the war, I worked in Saudi Arabia. Today, I have no job, house nor the possibility of moving. Our situation is disastrous, we have only God's help,\" said the father of 11 children.\n\nAhmed said they do not have nutritious food to give the children. \"They eat just flour every day. Sometimes they don't get vegetables or fruit or milk for weeks.\"\n\nThe thing that makes him suffer the most, he said, is feeling like a beggar. \"The war took away my dignity.\"", "description": "War-ravaged Yemenis, mainly children, suffer from malnutrition as humanitarian groups warn of unsafe drinking water.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/23/79d98c08f3b94fae8ca79f7166da6a98_18.jpg"}
