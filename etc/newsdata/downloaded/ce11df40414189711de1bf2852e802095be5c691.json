We don\u2019t want to get into a Cold War with China or Russia ... it is very unsafe for a hair-triggered world that is going to put 2 billion more people on the face of the earth by 2045. China has to be dealt with smartly.\"\n\nBaker questioned Hagel on whether President Trump's strong-arm approach to China is a winning move, or if tariffs are rebounding and hitting the American consumer as much as Beijing.\n\n\"I disagree with the president when he said trade wars are easy to win.\" Chuck Hagel, former Secretary of Defense under President Obama\n\n\"I don\u2019t know what history books he\u2019s referring to, but that\u2019s never the case,\" Hagel said. \"There are severe consequences in a trade war for everyone.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"But are we just putting our hands up if we don\u2019t take them on with tariffs?\" Baker pressed.\n\n\"No, of course not,\" Hagel responded. \"You have more than just one alternative ... But we\u2019ve got a fundamental issue here that\u2019s probably bigger than any of the issues, that we can\u2019t do anything about, and that\u2019s China is a communist authoritarian government. That\u2019s a structural problem beyond our ability to negotiate.\"\n\nTrade tensions escalated between the U.S. and China last week when Trump threatened to raise duties on $250-billion worth of Chinese goods from 25% up to 30%, and increase tariffs on another $300 billion in products from 10% to 15%. The president then urged American companies to leave the world's most populist country and move their operations back to the United States.\n\nChina seemingly softening their stance on retaliatory tariffs earlier this week when Gao Feng, a spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce, said China is willing to calmly resolve the trade dispute with the U.S. and is against any further escalation in tensions.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nTrade negotiations are set to continue in September with both sides convening face-to-face in Washington.", "description": "Chuck Hagel, the former Secretary of Defense under President Obama, said a cold war with China is possible of tensions aren't diffused.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/ap_17089303293172-1-5.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
