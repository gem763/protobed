It values the company at just under $8 billion, compared to the $47 billion that SoftBank reckoned it was worth in January, people with knowledge of the bid said on Monday.\n\nNot long ago, WeWork had been seeking to sell shares to stock investors to keep funding its growth. But that initial public offering was scrapped last month after Wall Street investors balked at its huge losses and unusual corporate governance structure.", "description": "The troubled shared office company scrapped an initial public offering and push out its chief executive last month.", "authors": ["Michael J.
