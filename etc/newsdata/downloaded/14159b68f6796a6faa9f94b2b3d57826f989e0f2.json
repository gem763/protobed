When life gets on top of us,\" William can be heard saying at the beginning of the clip.\n\n\"All over the country, millions of us face challenges to our mental health. At all ages, at all intensities, and for all sorts of reasons.\"\n\n\"Your brother, your mother, your friend, colleague, or your neighbor,\" Harry adds. \"Waiting. Wondering. Hoping. Hurting.\n\n\"We think there is nothing to be done, nothing we can do about it.\"\n\n\"But that is so wrong,\" Markle says.\n\n\"There are things we can do. From today, there's a new way to help turn things around. Every Mind Matters will show you simple ways to look after your mental health.\"\n\nMiddleton then says: \"It will get you started with a free online plan designed to help you deal with stress, boost your mood, improve your sleep, and feel more in control.\"\n\nThe commercial, which was written by \"Love Actually\" director Richard Curtis, reportedly caused the new NHS website to crash for a brief period after it aired on Monday evening.\n\n\"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have supported Every Mind Matters by voicing this special film showing how we can all look after our mental health,\" a spokesperson for the couples wrote on Instagram.\n\nThe content of the commercial won't be surprising to royal fans. After all, mental health is the primary focus of their \"Heads Together\" initiative, under which they launched the successful textline service, \"Shout.\"\n\nHowever, it marked the royal couples' first project together since Markle and Harry split from William and Middleton's Royal Foundation charity back in July.\n\nHarry and Markle are in the process of establishing their own charity, Sussex Royal, for which details are yet to be announced.\n\nRoyal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams previously told Insider that the charity is likely to focus on environmental issues, community, and gender equality, and will have strong links to the couple's social media.\n\n\"It is certainly a curious name for a charity but it has a contemporary feel to it and it ties in with their hugely popular Instagram account, which now has over 9 million followers. So this makes sense in a world dominated by social media,\" he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry's split from Kate Middleton and Prince William's charity is the latest sign of family rivalry, according to royal experts\n\nHere's how Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's first family royal tour is different from Prince William and Kate Middleton's\n\nHere's how the royal family would change if Meghan Markle and Prince Harry moved to the US", "description": "The \"Fab Four\" reunited to narrate a \"special film showing how we can look after our mental health,\" which aired in the UK on Monday evening.", "authors": ["Mikhaila Friel"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9c7582695b585b064c428b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
