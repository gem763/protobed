However, this still represented an all-time third-quarter record for net adds.\n\nShares of Netflix rallied from Wednesday\u2019s closing level, adding 10.4% to $316.53 following the release.\n\nNetflix also signaled it was taking strides to stem its free cash outflow as it spends heavily on content. In the third quarter, free cash flow totaled -$551 million, versus -$859 million in the comparable year-ago period. The company reiterated its guidance for free cash flow of about -$3.5 billion for the full year, and expects that free cash flow will improve in 2020 versus the current fiscal year.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, however, Netflix\u2019s guidance was light on virtually all major measures.\n\nThe streaming giant expects to add a total of 7.6 million global subscribers in the final three months of the year, well below current consensus for 9.23 million adds. And guidance for fourth-quarter earnings per share of 51 cents came in below expectations for 82 cents a share, and fourth-quarter sales guidance of $5.44 billion was short of expectations by $70 million.\n\nNetflix\u2019s stock has been under considerable pressure since its last earnings report, when the company reported a loss of domestic paid subscribers for the first time since 2011. Shares were down 22% since reporting second-quarter results in July through Wednesday\u2019s close, versus a little-changed S&P 500.\n\nNetflix downplays \u2018noisy\u2019 streaming wars\n\nHow Netflix stacks up against its emerging competitors. More\n\nNext month, the pool of streaming services available to consumers is set to become more crowded. Disney (DIS) is set to launch its eponymous streaming service, Disney+, on November 12, priced at $7.99 per month. Apple\u2019s (AAPL) streaming platform will launch November 1 at a starting price of $4.99 per month. Netflix\u2019s standard service currently costs $12.99 per month. That\u2019s in addition to other players already in the space, including Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video.\n\nThe specter of new entrants into the over-the-top streaming space has been an overhang for Netflix \u2014 an effect the company went out of its way to minimize in its Q3 report.\n\n\u201cThe launch of these new services will be noisy,\u201d Netflix said in its statement announcing third-quarter earnings. \u201cThere may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we\u2019ll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity.\u201d\n\nLast quarter, the company blamed a weaker slate of content, but not an increase in competition, for the miss on new subscribers.\n\n\u201cMany are focused on the \u2018streaming wars,\u2019 but we\u2019ve been competing with streamers (Amazon, YouTube, Hulu) as well as linear TV for over a decade,\u201d Netflix said Wednesday. \u201cThe upcoming arrival of services like Disney+, Apple TV+, HBO Max, and Peacock is increased competition, but we are all small compared to linear TV.\u201d\n\nThat said, many analysts believe the market can sustain multiple players \u2014 and Netflix will retain its dominance in the near term as the less established players build up their audience and content.", "description": "Netflix (NFLX) beat third-quarter earnings expectations, just before competitors launch a new batch of streaming services next month.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xzhFNuhJJ3tkE.g.eMm3Og--~B/aD01MTc7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2018-11/c065a800-f23b-11e8-bbd7-16ae4e4b99e9", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
