Trump officials last week held meetings on the issue just hours after White House adviser Peter Navarro dismissed the report as \u201cfake news,\u201d and zeroed in on how to prevent U.S. government retirement funds from financing China\u2019s economic rise, the people said.\n\nThe office of Larry Kudlow, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, convened a policy-coordination committee meeting last Tuesday, which also included officials from the National Security Council and the Treasury Department, the people added. An NEC spokesman declined to comment.\n\nThe yen strengthened against the dollar, U.S. stock futures went lower and bond yields extended declines.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the meeting, the administration\u2019s focus is now on ways to further scrutinize index providers\u2019 decision to add Chinese firms they consider a material risk for American investors. It\u2019s still unclear what legal authority the White House would rely on to force major indexes to drop certain Chinese companies.\n\nPension Fund\n\nAt least one of the issues under consideration is time-sensitive. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board in 2017 made a decision that by mid-2020 the international fund offered to workers in the government\u2019s pension would mirror the MSCI All Country World Index, which captures emerging markets, including China.\n\nSome U.S. lawmakers and China hawks outside the government have pushed the board to reverse that decision and, if necessary, have the administration use executive power to protect U.S. government workers. They argue that Americans are harmed by channeling money into Chinese firms that are allegedly involved in human-rights violations and at the center of U.S. national security concerns.\n\nThe change would expose almost US$50 billion in retirement assets of federal government employees, including members of the U.S. Armed Forces, to severe and undisclosed material risks associated with many of the Chinese companies listed on the index, opponents argue.\n\nBlacklist\n\nThe Commerce Department on Monday put a number of Chinese entities \u2014 including surveillance technology company Hikvision \u2014 on an export blacklist that prohibits American firms from doing business with them unless they have a U.S. government licence to do so. Hikvision, which is listed on the MSCI All Country World index, has been cited by Trump\u2019s advisers as one of several Chinese companies that presents a threat to American investors.\n\nIn response on Tuesday, a Chinese official warned it would retaliate.\n\nAs with most policy discussions in the Trump administration, the president\u2019s advisers have a range of opinions on the matter and haven\u2019t agreed on a path forward yet, people close to the deliberations said. The officials do seem to agree, however, that there\u2019s a political upside to engaging on the issue, the people added.\n\nThe White House is citing investor protection as the main reason for taking action and is carefully working to keep the matter separate from the ongoing trade negotiations that are set to resume in Washington this week.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at is U.S. investor protections, transparency and compliance with a number of laws,\u201d Kudlow told reporters Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s been complaints by the stock exchanges about this, the SEC has heard complaints, so we\u2019ve opened up a study group to take a look at it, but we\u2019re very early in our deliberations.\u201d\n\nTrade Talks\n\nAny action on capital flows could undoubtedly be seen as a negotiating chip by President Donald Trump, who has in the past put other issues on the table in the talks with Beijing.\n\nThe Office of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer isn\u2019t playing a key role in the discussions around capital flows because they are separate from the trade talks, two of the people said. A spokesman for Lighthizer didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nLighthizer, however, is Trump\u2019s point person in talks for a trade deal and any Chinese reaction to the investment limit plans would likely be taken to him in the context of the negotiations.\n\nThe options for investment limits that were initially discussed included forcing a delisting of Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges, imposing limits on investments in Chinese markets by U.S. government pension funds and putting caps on the value of Chinese companies included in indexes managed by U.S. firms, according to people familiar with and involved in the discussions.\n\nCapital Controls\n\nSince the deliberations first became public, administration efforts around delisting Chinese companies have been put on hold for now, the people said. A Treasury Department spokeswoman said Sept. 28 that option was not being contemplated \u201cat this time.\u201d She didn\u2019t address any of the other possibilities being examined and declined to offer any further details.\n\nKudlow on Monday also told reporters delisting plans were \u201cnot on the table.\u201d\n\nWhile the value of the pension fund and the money it would funnel into China\u2019s market next year is relatively small compared with the overall market and the value of Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges, the action has symbolic importance and could be interpreted as the first step in the U.S. government moving toward capital controls.\n\nIt\u2019s also a domestic winner for the White House, which would be able to claim that it stopped American armed forces and government workers\u2019 dollars from funding the rise of Chinese companies that Washington alleges have stolen intellectual property from U.S. firms to advance their technological lead over America. That fight is at the heart of Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing.\n\nSome Trump officials are still pushing for limits on the Chinese companies included in stock indexes managed by U.S. firms, though it\u2019s still an open question how that goal could be achieved. The hard-line advisers are concerned about indexes loading up on Chinese shares of companies that are subject to U.S. sanctions and therefore prohibited from doing business with the government. Those advisers consider it troubling that Americans aren\u2019t made aware of that material risk, people briefed on the talks said.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Sources say Trump administration is zeroing in on how to prevent U.S. government retirement funds from financing China's economic rise", "authors": ["Jenny Leonard", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/stocks.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
