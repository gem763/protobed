Instead, it was Brentford who claimed a deserved victory while the Rangers manager was left nursing a sense of injustice.\n\nHad Warburton\u2019s side won, they would have moved second in the Championship table, but the manner of Brentford\u2019s victory confirmed Thomas Frank\u2019s side are gathering their own momentum after claiming a third successive win.\n\nFor Warburton, though, the defining moment was the decision of referee Andy Woolmer to award Brentford a 60th-minute penalty after Bryan Mbeumo went down under a challenge by Josh Scowen. At that point, Rangers were level after Grant Hall had cancelled out \u00adOllie Watkins\u2019s opening goal, but Brentford restored their lead when Said Benrahma converted the \u00adpenalty and Watkins completed the win in added time.\n\n\u201cThat decision changes everything,\u201d Warburton said. \u201cYou have to be 100 per cent sure if you are going to give that. I can\u2019t say what I think or I\u2019ll get fined. But I am frustrated beyond belief. Josh pulls his leg away and holds his hand up.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame their player, players will do what they have to do. I thought [Burnley manager] Sean Dyche\u2019s comments this weekend were interesting. Players will do that if they get rewards. A VAR [video assistant referee] would not have given that, but we don\u2019t have that in the Championship.\u201d", "description": "Queens Park Rangers 1 Brentford 3", "authors": ["Ian Winrow", "Jim White", "Jason Burt", "Luke Edwards", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/28/214438545_PA_Queens-Park-Rangers-v-Brentford-Sky-Bet-Championship-Loftus-Road-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqttyRyXFeabwfmVyN1m33yYHVbdAUafXTUVjGtn8JTmk.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
