And when he does return he hopes Root is still at the helm.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely the man to take us forward. Absolutely, he\u2019s got a lot to give,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Ashes fourth Test: England player ratings Show all 11 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

A second unsuccessful Ashes campaign as skipper. Getty Images 4/11 Jason Roy - 4 Swapped positions with Denly after a torrid time at opener, making 22 and 31. Still looks a long way from proving himself a Test batsman. PA 5/11 Ben Stokes - 4 A crash back to earth after his unforgettable outing at Headingley. Could not produce a third batting miracle of the summer and injured his right shoulder after an expensive stint with the ball. Getty Images 6/11 Jonny Bairstow - 4 Another disappointing return with the bat for a man whose tank might just be empty after a huge workload. Solid with the gloves. Action Images via Reuters 7/11 Jos Buttler - 7 Gave a good account of his battling qualities in each innings in what was easily his best game of the series. Needs a major score soon to silence doubts but this was a start. Getty Images 8/11 Craig Overton - 5 Selected to some surprise ahead of Chris Woakes and Sam Curran, the Somerset man's home debut was a mixed bag. His seamers were only a notch above functional but he dug down for nearly three hours in forlorn pursuit of a draw. AP 9/11 Jofra Archer - 4 Wicketless for the first time in his short Test career in the first innings and down on pace before his juices started flowing midway through the match. Still a huge talent but the quietest of his three outings to date. Action Images via Reuters 10/11 Stuart Broad - 7 Continued his playground bullying of David Warner, dismissing him twice for nought, and took his series wicket tally to 19 with five in the match. No blame attached here.

But the team has been developing over the last few years and going into a big series like this you want a settled team that\u2019s fit and firing. I feel for Joe as he\u2019s not quite had that. It\u2019s been difficult.\u201d\n\nHead coach Trevor Bayliss ends his four-year reign at the end of the fifth Test and Anderson believes that represents a chance for Root to forge a new partnership with his successor.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see who England get in as the next coach and Joe and hopefully, whoever it is, he and Joe can hopefully take the Test team forward. We have shown signs what we can do, there have been signs of being a good Test side, but it\u2019s about making a good team on paper and putting it in practise on the field.\u201d\n\nAs for his own future, Anderson is strident. He has been asked questions about potential retirement plans for most of the last few years but his answers remain consistent.\n\nHe still loves the game and has no intention of turning his back on it, even after his recent fitness problems.\n\nThere is even a new target to aim for \u2013 taking his place in a tantalising pace attack with new star Jofra Archer and his long-time partner Stuart Broad.\n\n\u201cOne of the big frustrations about not playing is seeing the guys out on the field,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great to see Jofra taking to international cricket the way he has and Broady has been fantastic all series. He\u2019s shown his class all the way through.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to be a part of this bowling attack because I think we could have something special there.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m focused on trying to get myself fit again and try to get in shape for the winter. I have to try and get my body in as good shape as possible.\n\n\u201cI feel great, in as good condition as I\u2019ve been for a long time. It\u2019s just the calf that\u2019s been the hindrance. Get that working, strong again, and I\u2019m hopeful I can play a part in New Zealand or South Africa this winter.\n\n\u201cThe hunger is still there to go through that rehab process again. If there were any doubts, going through rehab can be tough mentally, but the fact I want to do it and am keen to get going again means I\u2019m still hungry.\u201d\n\nJames Anderson was speaking on behalf of \u2018The Test Experts\u2019 Specsavers, Official Test Partner for England cricket ahead of the final Test of the Specsavers Ashes Series at The Oval.\n\nPA", "description": "James Anderson believes Joe Root is still the best man to captain England\u00a0and has vowed to be part of the team\u2019s next chapter.
