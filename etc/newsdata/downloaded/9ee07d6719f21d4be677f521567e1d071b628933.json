Though Coach Ken Niumatalolo and offensive coordinator Ivin Jasper appreciate Perry\u2019s grit in trying to gain extra yardage, they also reminded him this week, with Air Force the next opponent, to protect himself.\n\nAD\n\nSally Jenkins: California law doesn\u2019t take from the NCAA. It keeps athletes from getting robbed.\n\nAfter all, the Midshipmen\u2019s triple-option attack, which leads all major college programs this season with 344.7 rushing yards per game, is greatly diminished without Perry directing it.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou try, but a lot of his stuff is cut-back,\u201d Niumatalolo said of instructing Perry to be more vigilant in avoiding contact. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like, \u2018Don\u2019t cut back anymore. Keep going to the sideline.\u2019 But it\u2019s such his nature, and Ivin\u2019s been trying to tell him, but he\u2019s obviously such a great cut-back runner.\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s got to remember, sometimes he\u2019s got to go down, man. Just keep going toward the sideline and get there.\u201d\n\nPerry had 91 yards and two touchdowns on 25 carries and completed 6 of 10 passes for 81 yards and a touchdown without an interception against the Tigers, the preseason favorite to win the West Division of the American Athletic Conference.\n\nAD\n\nHe leads Navy (2-1) in rushing with 275 yards and seven touchdowns, playing quarterback full-time after alternating between slot back and quarterback last year, when the Midshipmen limped to a 3-10 record for their fewest wins since Niumatalolo\u2019s first complete season in 2008.\n\nAD\n\nThey also failed in their bid to reclaim the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s Trophy for the first time since 2015, losing to both the Falcons, 35-7, in Colorado Springs, and Army, 17-14, in Philadelphia.\n\nPerry started at quarterback last year against Air Force (3-1), accounting for just 90 total yards in Navy\u2019s most lopsided loss since 2002 to its service academy rival to the west.\n\n\u201cReally, it comes down to Malcolm and just understanding,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cWe\u2019ve preached it. I\u2019ve talked to him about it. He\u2019s a competitive kid, just used to running, making all the cuts, stuff like that, but again he has to be smart, has to get down. He has to last the entire season for us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn 11 career starts at quarterback, Perry has carried 243 times for 1,505 yards and 20 touchdowns. He\u2019s one of five players in school history to have two 200-yard rushing games in a season (2017) and one of four with three in his career.\n\nAD\n\nHis 3,578 all-purpose yards are the fifth most at Navy, and Perry needs 383 rushing yards to become one of four Midshipmen players with at least 3,000 career rushing yards.\n\nThe others are academy legends Keenan Reynolds, Napoleon McCallum and Chris McCoy.\n\n\u201cObviously that\u2019s something I need to work on,\u201d Perry said of not taking unnecessary hits. \u201cCoach Jasper\u2019s in my ear about it a lot. I think it\u2019s something I\u2019ll get better at as the season progresses. My body\u2019s telling me to do the same thing, so I\u2019m going to have to find a better balance.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPerry was among a handful of major contributors on offense who missed plays in the Memphis game after getting hurt.\n\nStarting junior fullback Nelson Smith, the team\u2019s second-leading rusher, exited for good in the middle of the second quarter with concussion-like symptoms, and slot back Keoni-Kordell Makekau, a sophomore, departed in the third quarter after rushing for a career-high 101 yards.\n\nAD\n\nNiumatalolo indicated he expects those players to be available against Air Force, which has won four of the past seven meetings in the first leg of the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s Trophy series.\n\nThe Midshipmen have not lost at home to Air Force since 2011 and perhaps are in line to set another attendance record at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. The previous mark came in 2017 against the visiting Falcons, with an announced crowd of 38,792. Saturday\u2019s game has been announced as a sellout.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe do treat every game the same, but there is something special deep down about these games,\u201d said Navy center Ford Higgins, one of four senior captains. \u201cNot only do we represent us as a football team, but we represent the Naval Academy, and more so than that we represent the Navy and Marine Corps.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we take pride in, especially when we get another military academy coming in.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHoward QB Caylin Newton will redshirt and transfer after playing four games this year\n\nTennessee football player to police during arrest: \u2018Where I\u2019m from, we shoot at cops\u2019\n\nRichard Sherman hopes new California law \u2018destroys the NCAA\u2019\n\nMaryland\u2019s Lorenzo Harrison III to have knee surgery, further depleting running back corps\n\nAnalysis: Auburn deserves to be No. 1 in college football rankings\n\nAD", "description": "The senior quarterback is having a strong season heading into the Mids' first rivalry game, but to his coach said to protect himself \u201che\u2019s got to remember, sometimes he\u2019s got to go down, man.\"", "authors": ["Gene Wang", "Sports Reporter Covering Local", "National College Football"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1Wa85QBWb4tQLTUbIVVk7EjfjPo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BCIW2PXAZMI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
