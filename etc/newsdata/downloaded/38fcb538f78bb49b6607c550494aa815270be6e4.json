He had a grand slam against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Wednesday as the Nationals stormed back to win Game 5 in the NLCS 7-3 in 10 innings. He has struggled on defense but his bat is too good to be on the bench.\n\nKendrick hit .344 in regular-season play this year for the Nationals and .304 last season.\n\nThe 36-year-old from Florida has played first, second, third and left field during his time in Washington. The Nationals are looking to take a 3-0 series lead and aiming for first World Series berth in franchise history.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
