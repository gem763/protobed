When I think the response should be, \u2018We\u2019re doing nothing now and we\u2019re seeing people slaughtered in their schools, at work, at a Walmart, in a synagogue, in a church, at a concert. There is violence right now and it is horrifying and it is terrifying and it is terrorizing.\u2019.... We should be worried about that kind of violence right now.\u201d\n\nMcCain responded Thursday on Twitter by saying: \u201cBeto is the only man in all of Texas who would revise \u2018Come and Take It\u2019 to \u2018Please, Come and Take It.\u2019\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments came after a tour of Congregation Beit Simchat Torah in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday, where he met with immigrants and asylum seekers participating in the congregation\u2019s legal clinic which assists in the completion of asylum applications. After touring the synagogue, O\u2019Rourke spoke exclusively with The Daily Beast about his gun control plans, during which he urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to call Congress back into session to vote on gun control legislation.\n\n\u201cIf the urgency that people feel on this issue is not reflected in the leadership that they see in this country, then they begin to give up hope,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that can lead to more of the cynicism, can force people to give up hope, stop them from having faith in our ability to actually get something done and you know when you lose that faith, when you lose that hope and when you lose that drive, then you\u2019re no longer working towards that solution. I think that\u2019s a dangerous place for the country to be.\u201d\n\nSince returning to the campaign trail, O\u2019Rourke has made an effort to go to traditionally redder parts of the country, including a gun show in Arkansas and the most Trump-friendly part of Virginia. The approach has mirrored his somewhat improvisational Texas Senate run that took him to Republican territory throughout the Lone Star state. He maintains that in these face-to-face conversations, there is more openness to the issues he\u2019s discussing than what many in conservative media say. That includes things like a mandatory buyback program, which was implemented in Australia following that country\u2019s worst mass shooting and has resulted in a dramatic drop of gun-related deaths there.\n\n\u201cI think in a mandatory buyback, the vast majority of people will follow the law,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cNot everyone will agree with it, not everyone will like it. But I think that ultimately, they\u2019ll follow the law. And I think many will see this in the national interest. I listen to gun owners and non-gun owners alike who just who say that this current level of bloodshed and violent death in this country is unacceptable. Worries them, it worries their kids and they want to do something about it. And I can\u2019t escape the conclusion that even universal background checks and red flag laws and ending the sale of weapons of war would not be enough to significantly change the outcome.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke had not specifically built his presidential campaign around a push for national gun policy. The issue, instead, found him after his home city of El Paso witnessed a deadly mass shooting earlier this month. But the congressman also is maintaining his focus on other policies, as was evident by his decision to meet with asylum seekers before jetting off to the CNN climate town hall.\n\nAsked which of these issues, among the many others, he would prioritize first in the Oval Office, the Texas Democrat rejected the premise of the question and said it was vital to make progress on everything as soon as possible; though he specifically said \u201cit\u2019s hard for me to think of a more important issue,\u201d than climate change.\n\n\u201cIt is existential,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told The Daily Beast. \u201cIf we cannot get this right\u2014I think the trajectory now is by 2100, we will have warmed another four or four-and-a-half degrees Celsius\u2014my youngest son will be 88 years old and he\u2019ll be fucked.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated to include McCain\u2019s response.", "description": "The ex-congressman has championed a mandatory gun buyback proposal.
