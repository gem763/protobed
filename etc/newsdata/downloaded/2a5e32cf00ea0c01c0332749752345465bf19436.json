While Disney+ has mostly gotten buzz over the original shows they have in development, the fact is that the majority of their catalogue will be made up of Disney classics of yesteryear. And when we say classics, we mean \u201cmovies you probably forgot existed, if you knew they existed at all.\u201d Here are a few films that the official Disney+ Twitter account announced would be streaming, and, just to reiterate, these are real movie titles and not the products of a random old movie name generator: Justin Morgan Had a Horse (1972), Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971), and, who could forget, The Ghosts of Buxley Hall (1980). It\u2019s likely that amidst all the noise over Star Wars and Marvel on the new streaming platform, these forgotten classics may stay forgotten. But fear not: the ungodly long thread of every single obscure movie uploaded to the Disney catalogue is pinned to the official Twitter account of Disney+ for your reference. So just in case your VHS collection burns in a house fire, Disney+ has your back. Disney+ goes live on November 12, 2019.", "description": "Disney+ tweets out list of movies available for streaming on the platform in November, including Fuzzbucket and The Ghosts of Buxley Hall.", "authors": ["Charu Sinha"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/14/14-justin-morgan-had-a-horse.w1200.h630.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
