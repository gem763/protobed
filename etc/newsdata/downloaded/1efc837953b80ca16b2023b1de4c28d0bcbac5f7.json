Even before Durham received his new powers, Democrats and others had expressed concerns that Trump wanted to weaponize the Justice Department to further his political aims.\n\nUntil now, Durham, who heads the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Connecticut, has been doing a review into U.S. counterintelligence activities conducted by the CIA, FBI and other agencies before and after the 2016 election, especially related to Trump\u2019s campaign and the early days of his presidency.\n\nU.S. Attorney General William Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee in May he was concerned there may have been improper spying, though he added at the time he didn\u2019t have any concrete evidence. Shortly after the hearing, Barr appointed Durham to lead the review.\n\nSince then, Barr has displayed a strong personal interest in advancing the probe, including traveling twice in recent months to ask Italian intelligence officials for help. He also has been in contact with Australian and British officials.\n\nTrump has ordered intelligence agencies to cooperate with the review and gave Barr wide authority to declassify documents.\n\nFBI and CIA officials have said that they conducted legal and court-authorized surveillance when they learned of the Russian interference. But Trump and his allies contend that the surveillance -- which they call spying -- was an illegal operation to damage his campaign and presidency.\n\nIronically, the impeachment inquiry began over Trump\u2019s activities involving Ukraine. A conspiracy theory promoted by some conservatives holds that Ukrainian operatives, and not Russians, tried to influence the American election to help Trump\u2019s opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Chris Strohm in Washington at cstrohm1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Kevin Whitelaw at kwhitelaw@bloomberg.net, John Harney\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into whether Donald Trump or his 2016 presidential campaign was illegally spied upon, according to a person familiar with the matter, escalating the controversy surrounding an inquiry that has remained largely secret for months.John", "authors": ["Chris Strohm"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
