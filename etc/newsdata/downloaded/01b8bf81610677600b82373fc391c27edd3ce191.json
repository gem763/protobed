The Indian government has denied any excess of force and said all allegations against the paramilitary are thoroughly investigated.\n\nThe Pakistani prime minister will press the international community \u201cforcefully\u201d during the general assembly speech on Friday, foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said.\n\nMr Khan will \u201chighlight the ongoing atrocities in Kashmir and the responsibility of the international community to avoid a genocide there\u201d, Sardar Masood Khan, president of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir, told The Guardian.\n\nIndia, however, is insistent that what it does with its part of Kashmir is an internal matter, not for discussion on the UN stage.\n\nAt a press conference in Delhi, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale said the general assembly was an opportunity for Mr Modi to talk about India\u2019s \u201cglobal role and global expectations\u201d.\n\nIt is certainly set to be a busy week for the prime minister. His packed agenda for the week ahead is expected to include an address to the 2019 Climate Action Summit beginning on Monday, as well as a series of events reviewing the progress of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nHe will be handed the 2019 \u201cGlobal Gatekeeper Award\u201d at an event by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in recognition of the Swachch Bharat programme building toilets across the country.\n\nMr Modi will also host a special event on Gandhi\u2019s legacy. This year India marks the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s birth on 2 October.\n\nAnd he will be the keynote speaker on Wednesday\u2019s Bloomberg Global Business Forum, taking part in a Q&A session moderated by Michael Bloomberg.\n\nAs for Kashmir, \u201cthere will be no discussion on it and we will not discuss it\u201d, Mr Gokhale said. \u201cIf [Pakistan] wish to dwell on this issue in the speech by their prime minister then they are welcome to do so.\n\n\u201cOur prime minister will focus on what the UN General Assembly\u2019s high level segment is meant to focus on\u2026 what we are doing for development, for security, for peace and our expectations and aspirations of other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nIndia may be seeking to shut down any talk of Kashmir on the global stage, but there are expected to be several events throughout the week involving Mr Modi and Donald Trump where that might be easier said than done.\n\nMr Trump has offered several times in recent months to \u201cmediate\u201d or to \u201chelp\u201d India and Pakistan reduce tensions over Kashmir, despite India\u2019s repeated insistence that the only international talks it will consider on the issue will be with Islamabad directly.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr Modi kicked off his US visit with an event in Texas for just some of the estimated 4 million-strong Indian diaspora living in America.", "description": "India will refuse to entertain any conversations about the fraught situation in Kashmir during the upcoming week of talks at the UN General Assembly, government officials say.Pakistan, meanwhile, will make it a priority to raise the issue at any opportunity, most significantly during prime minister Imran", "authors": ["Adam Withnall"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VSyl3BVrBHDMvtE6Qvdbog--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/631bf663e551efe3ea39675529403f6e", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
