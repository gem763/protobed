Moore-Gilbert is accused by Iranian authorities of \u201cspying for another country\u201d.\n\nNegotiations over the fate of the university lecturer are \u201cvery long term\u201d, Payne said.\n\n\u201cShe has been detained for some considerable time and has faced the Iranian legal system and has been convicted and sentenced,\u201d the minister said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t accept the charges on which she was convicted and we would seek to have her returned to Australia,\u201d Payne added, declining to comment further on the case.\n\nPayne has maintained the cases of those detained were not related to diplomatic tensions.\n\nAustralia said in August it would join a US-led naval coalition to escort commercial ships in the Gulf, after a spate of attacks blamed on Iran but that Tehran denied.\n\nHowever, that announcement is believed to have come after the arrests.\n\n\u2013 Prisoner swap proposal \u2013\n\nNews of the release of the King and Firkin comes just weeks after an Iranian woman arrested in Australia and sentenced in the United States was returned home.\n\nNegar Ghodskani was sentenced last month in Minneapolis to 27 months in prison for violating sanctions against Tehran, but was released following time served in custody in Australia and the United States.\n\nAfter her extradition to the US, she confessed to participation in a conspiracy to illegally export technology to Iran in breach of sanctions, according to the US Justice Department.\n\nShe was pregnant when she was arrested in 2017 in Australia where she was a legal resident. She gave birth while in Australian custody and her son was sent to Iran to live with his father.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in April floated a potential prisoner swap with a British-Iranian mother being held in Tehran.\n\nHe suggested exchanging Ghodskani for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, in jail in Tehran for alleged sedition.\n\nZaghari-Ratcliffe has also been separated from her daughter while in custody.", "description": "Sydney (AFP) \u2013 An Australian travel-blogging couple detained in Iran on spying charges have been released and returned home, Canberra said Saturday,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/813a08_pair-had-travelling-overland-australia-britain-detained-in-iran-australian-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
