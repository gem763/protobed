Take, for instance, movies like Get Out, A Quiet Place and Paranormal Activity which are (mostly) gore-free.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a scary movie\u2060 without all the blood and stabbing\u2060, we have a few suggestions. Beginning with a few staff favourites, below you\u2019ll find our list of gore-free films that won\u2019t leave your stomach churning.\n\nNight of the Living Dead (1968)\n\nHear us out: If you\u2019re looking for a non-gory classic, George A. Romero\u2019s Night of the Living Dead might be your answer. It\u2019s largely because of this film that we now have shows like The Walking Dead\u2014or basically any modern movie with zombies. As for blood and gore, it\u2019s a mild movie by today\u2019s standards.\n\nMisery (1990)\n\nKathy Bates is a national treasure and Misery is proof of that. The film is a two-hour exploration of one fan\u2019s obsession and mostly free of jump-scares and gore. Spoiler alert\u2014when she starts strapping James Caan\u2019s character to the bed, it\u2019s probably best to look away.\n\nThe Craft (1996)\n\nIn the late 90s, the mainstream horror genre largely belonged to bloody dramas centered around young people, as in films like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer\u2014but few come close to the campy high school drama, The Craft. Watch it because of how weird and wonderful it is.\n\nThe Blair Witch Project (1999)\n\nIn The Blair Witch Project, you won\u2019t see any blood or gore\u2014but that\u2019s exactly what makes this film particularly terrifying. The film is largely about your imagination\u2014and what\u2019s scarier than that?\n\nGremlins (1984)\n\nIf you want something a little lighter than your standard horror flick, Gremlins is a good place to start, as a film that explores what happens when a bunch of Furbys come to life and wreak havoc.\n\nAnd in case you haven\u2019t found something you\u2019re look for just yet, here are even more ideas:", "description": "If you\u2019re the kind of person who gets squeamish at the sight of blood, you might think that horror movies  aren\u2019t for you\u2014but you should know that the genre isn\u2019t all gore and guts.
