Speaking on BBC Radio 4 earlier this week, he also said that the bill put forward by Hilary Benn and others \u2013 intended to rule out a no deal Brexit unless parliament consents \u2013 would cost British taxpayers \u00a31bn a month. That\u2019s based on the fact that we would be paying into the EU budget for longer.\n\nThis is an example of how a claim can be misleading without necessarily being incorrect. It needs more context.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It relies on the assumption that under no deal, the UK won\u2019t pay the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d agreed with the EU. And it completely ignores a pretty fundamental point: that no deal itself would have significant costs.\n\nThe \u201cdivorce bill\u201d agreed by Theresa May\u2019s government already includes the UK\u2019s normal payments into the EU budget until December 2020. The legislation currently before parliament itself proposes an extension only until January 2020.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

And so, leaving with a deal in January 2020 wouldn\u2019t cost more in EU budget contributions than leaving with a deal in October 2019 would.\n\nThis has already happened once: the original settlement was around \u00a339 bn, but this is now down to \u00a333bn, largely as a result of extending Brexit from March to October this year.\n\nThe government could of course plan to try and renegotiate this financial settlement before 31 October, but we aren\u2019t aware of any indication so far that they hope to do this. The government position is that it still wants to leave with a deal, and any renegotiation efforts are focused on the question of the Irish backstop.\n\nIf Johnson is comparing the cost of any extension to a no-deal exit at the end of October, then his figure of \u00a31bn for monthly EU contributions is in the right ballpark. However, as BBC Reality Check has pointed out, this doesn\u2019t factor in payments received from the EU, which would reduce the amount by about a quarter.\n\nIt\u2019s also not entirely clear that leaving with no deal would mean we could avoid paying the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d, something which Boris Johnson has said several times would be his plan in a no-deal scenario.\n\nWhen Full Fact looked at this question earlier this year, we found that under international law it\u2019s not clearly set out that the UK has to pay anything once it has left the EU. However, the EU would be within its rights to take the case to the International Court of Justice on the grounds of the UK\u2019s repeated commitments to pay, and the outcome of such a case would be hard to predict.\n\nLike a lot of what\u2019s said by all sides in the Brexit debate, context is everything. While not necessarily wrong to compare the potential cost of an extension to a no-deal exit, it\u2019s misleading to do so given that the government\u2019s stated intent is still to leave with a deal.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re going to make such a comparison, then you do need to actually compare the costs of both things \u2013 you need to factor in the fact that no deal itself will have both direct costs, and a broader economic impact. Most studies predict that the negative economic effects of leaving the EU will exceed the benefits of not having to pay the EU membership fee.\n\nTom Phillips is editor of Full Fact, the UK's independent fact checking charity", "description": "In Boris Johnson\u2019s first prime minister\u2019s questions yesterday he claimed it would cost a net \u00a31bn per month for Britain to stay in the EU beyond 31 October.", "authors": ["Tom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/12/eu-citizens.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
