She counts fellow legends Iggy Pop, Debbie Harry and Alice Cooper as close friends.\n\nAnd while many older rock stars have called it a day, Suzi, whose on-stage leather outfits were inspired by Elvis, is still going strong after more than five decades on the road and 55 million-plus record sales.\n\nYet it is a royal encounter that is \u00aduppermost in her mind when we talk to her in a swanky lounge of London\u2019s Hard Rock Hotel. She met Prince Charles at a Prince\u2019s Trust event in the mid 80s and it turned out he was a big fan.\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\nSuzi chuckled as she recalled her \u00adencounter with her unlikely admirer.\n\nShe said: \u201cHe was meeting all the \u00adperformers, and while walking past me he said loudly, \u2018You have the best legs since Tina Turner.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was speechless \u2013 my jaw fell open. I should have said \u2018thank you,\u2019 but I froze. It was an honour but I handled it like a bumbling idiot.\u201d\n\nThe feisty star has not always been so retiring. She once threw old pal Iggy Pop out of one of her gigs.\n\nShe said: \u201cI thought we were going to jam but he was out of it and started going crazy. I had to have him removed because he was being so nutty. I\u2019m sure he forgives me, though.\u201d\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nSuzi does not think of herself as a hell-raiser and has never taken drugs. .\n\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019m really square \u2013 my husband calls me the \u2018mild one\u2019, not the \u2018wild one\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d drink, play poker and dance but I was too much my mother\u2019s daughter to go off the rails.\u201d\n\nBut she did trash a hotel room.\n\nShe recalled: \u201cIt was the end of a seven-month tour, and everybody went nuts. I cut open my pillow and snowed everyone with feathers and we blew up a TV.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was the time she shot Alice Cooper in the face. Alice, now 71, and Suzi were having a fight with dart guns in a hotel.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nShe said: \u201cHe peeked out from behind a TV, my arrow hit him between the eyes. He said his first thought was, \u2018good shot\u2019, and the next was, \u2018ouch\u2019.\u201d Suzi\u2019s hot stage image was not intentional but did attract unwelcome \u00adattention from men. She said: \u201cIt was never about being sexy. I just thought a tight suit would hold everything in one place.\n\n\u201cDuring one gig a guy was making rude gestures with his tongue.\n\n\u201cSo I moved over, swung my guitar and whacked him on the head. I made it look like part of the show. He was disgusting \u2013 but he paid the price.\u201d\n\nSuch a gutsy \u00adnature helped Suzi cope in the male-dominated world of rock.\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nShe said: \u201cMy attitude was, \u2018I\u2019m a bass player. Do you have a problem with that?\u2019 It won me respect, but even to this day, if somebody p**ses me off, I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Don\u2019t f**k with me.\u2019\u201d\n\nToday she believes singers\u2019 attitudes have changed for the worse.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s like, \u2018how many clothes can you take off?\u2019 I don\u2019t like it. We have this #MeToo movement but women go on stage \u00adembarrassingly naked. How does that make sense?\u201d On the subject of #MeToo \u2013 sparked by sexual assault claims against film producer Harvey Weinstein \u2013 Suzi\u2019s views are \u00adsurprisingly blunt.\n\nShe said: \u201cIf I was an actress and had a work meeting with a producer in his room, that would ring a warning bell.\n\n\u201cAnd if he then walked out of his bathroom in a \u00adbathrobe\u2026 would any \u00adwoman with half a brain stay?\u201d Suzi insisted it\u2019s \u201can entirely different matter\u201d if there is a sexual assault.\n\nShe said: \u201cThey should be strung up by their balls. But don\u2019t put yourself in stupid \u00adsituations. I\u2019m all for empowering women and equality but don\u2019t be dumb.\u201d\n\nNew docu-film Suzi Q charts the \u00adtrailblazer\u2019s rise to the top after she started a band with her sisters called the Pleasure Seekers aged just 14.\n\nShe struggled to get a record deal after moving from Detroit to London in 1971 but her eventual breakthrough produced massive hits with memorable TV \u00adappearances on Top of the Pops.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nEssex-based Suzi married her lead guitarist, Len Tuckey, in 1976. They had two kids, Laura, now 37, and Richard, 34, who she always took on tour with her as youngsters.\n\nShe said: \u201cI had to take fertility drugs to have them and I didn\u2019t go through two \u00adcaesareans just to leave them at home.\u201d Suzi once spoke of her anguish over having an abortion, aged 18, following a fling with a record exec, but said: \u201cI have only one regret in life, and that\u2019s the fact I didn\u2019t go back to the States to see my mother in the last week of her life.\n\n\u201cMy producer said, \u2018Don\u2019t go \u2013 you can\u2019t handle it.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Maybe he\u2019s right.\u2019 But in all honesty if I had that choice again, I would go.\u201d\n\nAfter splitting from Len she wed tour promoter Rainer Hass in 1993 \u2013 but they have never lived together in 26 years. \u201cWe go back and forth between the UK and his home in Germany. It keeps the romance fresh and I like my own company.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nSuzi\u2019s not worried about ageing and has no interest in plastic surgery.\n\nShe said: \u201cI embrace ageing. You can\u2019t reverse the process. We\u2019re all going to get old. So many people look like they saw the same doctor. I don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nSo does she have to work out to squeeze into those catsuits? She said: \u201cI don\u2019t need one.\n\n\"On stage I wear a heavy guitar under hot lights, and I\u2019m basically \u00adjogging, singing and playing for two hours. No gym workout can do that.\u201d\n\nSuzi once won Rear of the Year \u2013 and she rubbishes claims that is sexist. She said: \u201cI\u2019m proud. If you have a nice ass, so what? Political correctness is stupid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a good backside, and I\u2019m still shaking it at 69.\u201d As well as bossing it on stage, Suzi memorably starred in US sitcom Happy Days as the sister of Fonzie, played by Henry Winkler.\n\nShe is still good pals with Winkler and said: \u201cI love him \u2013 he gave me plenty of clues on set. He\u2019s intelligent and could have been a great \u00adpolitician.\u201d Suzi would like to act more and be on Strictly Come Dancing .\n\nBut she has turned down I\u2019m A Celeb at least nine times. One thing is for \u00adcertain, Suzi has no \u00adretirement plan. She said: \u201cMy dad worked until he was 89, so I\u2019m still a baby. I\u2019ve got 20 years in me yet.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The world\u2019s first female rock megastar is now a 69-year-old grandmother but is still \u00ad\u201cshaking her ass\u201d and happy to talk about sex and drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll", "authors": ["Anna Pointer", "Image", "Tim Merry", "Mirrorpix", "Daily Record", "Rex Shutterstock", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20465861.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Suzy-Quatro.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
