They were outstanding.\u201d\n\nWhile overall pleased with the performance, Hansen was also happy that several of his players like prop Atu Moli, who played the full 80 minutes, and centres Sonny Bill Williams and Jack Goodhue had got some solid game time under their belts.\n\nWilliams was especially influential, creating havoc in the Canadian defence while a clever kick set up Beauden Barrett\u2019s try and he provided the final pass for Ioane to score.\n\n\u201cHe played really well tonight, he\u2019s got a kicking game, I think he\u2019s done that kick about four times and we\u2019ve scored four times from it,\u201d Hansen said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been working hard, and he\u2019s injury free and we\u2019re starting to see the old Sonny.\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks face Namibia in Tokyo on Sunday before finishing the pool phase against Italy in Toyota City on Oct. 12.", "description": "All Blacks coach Steve Hansen's plan to win their third successive World Cup has started to bear fruit with a scintillating spell of precision rugby at pace when they scored 28 points in 10 minutes against Canada on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436264980&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9113Q"}
