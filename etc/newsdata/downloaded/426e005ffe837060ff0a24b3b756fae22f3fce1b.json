The decomposition of functions into these modular units provides the operators the flexibility to scale them independently; scalability and flexibility that wasn\u2019t possible with 4G EPC.\n\nMavenir has invested heavily in developing the 5G Core solution from the ground-up on cloud-native principles that can still be retrofitted on EPCs. The solution encompasses all the major 5G core elements, such as AMF, SMF, UPF, NRF, UDSF, PCF, UDM, UDR, NSSF, AUSF, BSF, N3IWF, SCP, SEPP, and SMSF. All these functions are implemented as micro-services in containers. In addition, Mavenir is also building remaining 5G core functions, NEF, 5G-EIR, NWDAF etc.\n\nThe Mavenir 5G Core also combines 4G EPC functionality and offers a \u2018Converged Mobile Core\u2019 solution that supports both 4G and 5G subscribers. In addition, the Mavenir 5G Core supports all Standalone (SA) and Non-Standalone (NSA) options. This includes 5G SA Option 2 and Option 5, as well as 5G NSA Option 4 and Option 7. With this comprehensive solution, operators will be able to support in parallel existing 4G subscribers, deploy new commercial grade 5G use cases and reap the benefit of a full array of features and capabilities that 5G promises in early 2020.\n\nMavenir\u2019s investment in building the 5G Core in a future proof way has generated tremendous interest from service providers around the globe. Mavenir\u2019s 5G Core is being tested at Tier-1 operators in Asia Pacific, Europe and in North America.\n\n\u201cMavenir is engaged with almost all the leading operators in all regions that are showing eagerness in being early adopters and taking advantage of a truly cloud-native microservices-based 5G Core solution,\u201d said Pardeep Kohli, Mavenir\u2019s President and CEO. \u201cThis 5G Core allows mobile operators to move directly to next generation technology instead of investing in older 4G elements and Mavenir has the resources and plans to continue to develop the entire scope of 5G Core portfolio.\u201d\n\nAdded Kohli, \u201cThis 5G Core solution, along with Mavenir\u2019s recent announcement of 4G/5G OpenRAN, affirms the fact that Mavenir is a truly end-to-end network provider.\u201d\n\nAt Mobile World Congress Los Angeles, Mavenir will be showcasing the deployment of 6 different 5GC CNFs. Mavenir\u2019s 5G Core solution will be demonstrated along with automation to deploy the Container as a Service (CaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) based on Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) open source components. To complement the leading edge 5G Core solution, Mavenir has developed automation of deployment and configuration of the CaaS, PaaS and 5G Core Container Network Functions (CNFs).\n\nRequest a meeting or learn more here.\n\nAbout Mavenir:\n\nMavenir is the industry\u2019s only end-to-end, cloud-native network software provider.
