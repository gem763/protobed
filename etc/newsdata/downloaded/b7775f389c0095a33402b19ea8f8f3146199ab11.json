Yesterday, the Inspector General sent a letter to Congress alerting Capitol Hill that his reporting process on the probe of the FBI\u2019s actions in Operation Crossfire Hurricane was \u201cnearing completion.\u201d Michael Horowitz explained that he is waiting for some final determinations on classification, but doesn\u2019t anticipate the need for multiple versions of the report:\n\nJustice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz told Senate and House lawmakers Thursday that the process of finalizing his report into potential Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuses ahead of the 2016 presidential election was \u201cnearing completion,\u201d according to a letter obtained by Fox News. The \u201clengthy\u201d draft report \u201cconcerns sensitive national security and law enforcement matters,\u201d Horowitz wrote in the letter, adding that he anticipated \u201cthe final report will be released publicly with few redactions.\u201d \u2026 \u201cAfter we receive the final classification markings from the Department and the FBI, we will then proceed with our usual process for preparing a final report, including ensuring that appropriate reviews occur for accuracy and comment purposes,\u201d Horowitz wrote in the letter. \u201cOnce begun, we do not anticipate the time for that review to be lengthy.\u201d\n\nThat still sounds as though the publication of the report is a few weeks off, at least. Earlier, sources had thought that Horowitz would be able to publish as early as last month, and certainly before Thanksgiving. That would have put it ahead of Democrats\u2019 attempts to impeach Donald Trump, although the grounds for that action have shifted almost entirely away from the Russiagate probe that Horowitz is investigating.\n\nThat timing might complicate the White House\u2019s ability to push back against impeachment, but it\u2019s not slowing down the expansion of the probe. In fact, Fox News reported last night, Horowitz\u2019 report will explain why US Attorney John Durham has transformed his review into a full-fledged criminal investigation:\n\nU.S. Attorney John Durham\u2019s ongoing probe into potential FBI and Justice Department misconduct in the run-up to the 2016 election through the spring of 2017 has transitioned into a full-fledged criminal investigation, two sources familiar with the investigation told Fox News on Thursday night. One source added that DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s upcoming report on alleged FBI surveillance abuses against the Trump campaign will shed light on why Durham\u2019s probe has become a criminal inquiry. Horowitz announced on Thursday his report would be available to the public soon, with \u201cfew\u201d redactions. The investigation\u2019s new status means Durham can subpoena witnesses, file charges, and impanel fact-finding grand juries.\n\nThe rest of the Fox report mainly regurgitates what\u2019s already been known about the issues surrounding both investigations. Last night, however, some chatter erupted that Durham and Horowitz might have taken a keen interest in how the case against Michael Flynn developed. Flynn\u2019s new attorneys filed motions to dismiss Flynn\u2019s earlier guilty plea and the case itself over alleged FBI misconduct that only recently came to the defense\u2019s attention. Sidney Powell accused the FBI of cooking the Flynn interview records to create a false obstruction case:\n\nBREAKING \u2013 new @SidneyPowell1 filing in the Flynn case.

The part about former DNI James Clapper leaking to Washington Post columnist David Ignatius would also be very, very interesting \u2014 if actually corroborated by evidence. Filings in court do not necessarily mean evidentiary support, a point to keep in mind at all times, but something seems to have captured the attention of both investigators. And this might not be all of the catalyst for the Durham decision, or even a major part of it. We just won\u2019t know until we read the Horowitz report \u2026 whenever that happens.\n\nCriminal probes are quite the rage these days at the DoJ, however, and not just those targeting the president\u2019s opponents. Politico reports that the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has become at least a subject, if not a target, of a DoJ criminal probe. That could make his presence around Trump even more awkward than it already is:\n\nHis responsibilities are shrinking as Donald Trump\u2019s TV-friendly personal attorney. His efforts to dig up dirt on the president\u2019s political opponents have landed his highest-profile client in a congressional impeachment investigation. And two of his foreign-born business associates are headed to trial on charges that are part of a broader effort by federal prosecutors eyeing Giuliani himself. The scrutiny isn\u2019t just coming from the previously known probes by FBI agents and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office based out of Manhattan, according to two people familiar with the investigation. The criminal division of the Justice Department in Washington has taken an interest in the former New York mayor, too, meaning an expansion of resources that indicates the politically sensitive probe into the president\u2019s personal attorney is both broader and moving at a faster pace than previously understood. \u2026 \u201cHe appears to be a subject, if not a target of an active investigation. So to have him be a part of the legal team would be troublesome to say the least,\u201d said Greg Brower, who served as the FBI\u2019s top liaison to Congress until 2018. \u201cAt best, it\u2019s a messy situation and more likely it\u2019s just completely dysfunctional.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then how long can Giuliani continue as Trump\u2019s attorney? Granted, this might be a ploy to separate them, but (a) Trump\u2019s got enough resources to hire an entire fleet of white-shoe attorneys to look after his interests, and (b) Giuliani has been a trainwreck for Trump anyway. Trump should have cut Giuliani loose months ago, a move which might have allowed the White House to distance itself from Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine meddling and the political damage it did. It\u2019s too late for that kind of pawn sacrifice now, but there seems to be little to know value in keeping Giuliani so close to Trump now.\n\nUpdate: James Clapper only found out about the criminal probe last night while he was on the air with Anderson Cooper, and he seems pretty flummoxed by it. Other than questioning the timing, the former DNI doesn\u2019t have much to say:\n\nHe did seem a bit nervous, no? Given Clapper\u2019s long record of honest and forthright public service, what has he got to be nervous about?", "description": "But: DoJ's criminal division now looking at Giuliani, too.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/durham.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
