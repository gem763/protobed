You\u2019re not going to be allowed to use it against your fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nThe former Texas congressman was asked Friday by the seemingly confused MSNBC host Willie Geist how he would implement his plan to take military-style weapons out of the public realm. O\u2019Rourke responded that people would simply be required to comply with the law he\u2019s proposing, which would introduce a mandatory buyback program for semiautomatic weapons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s expecting Americans to follow the law,\u201d said O\u2019Rourke, who has made gun violence a central issue in his bid for the presidency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not voluntary,\u201d he said later. \u201cIt is mandatory. It will be the law.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Beto O'Rourke explains his assault weapon confiscation remarks at the Democratic debate on @Morning_Joe.\n\n\n\n\"It is mandatory. It will be the law.\"https://t.co/mk9iA5ygPg pic.twitter.com/nKjFNPo2n4 \u2014 MSNBC (@MSNBC) September 13, 2019\n\nBut it will not lead to \u201cfederal agents knocking on doors\u201d to seize the weapons, as Geist suggested it might.\n\n\u201cAs with many of our laws, we don\u2019t go door-to-door searching people\u2019s homes to see if they are in fact breaking the law,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\n\u201cBut congressman, you know, the law is that those guns are legal right now,\u201d asked Geist, apparently not grasping that O\u2019Rourke was discussing a different reality. \u201cSo how would they be breaking the law by owning those guns?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause by working with Congress ... we\u2019re going to change the law so it will no longer be legal to hold one of these,\u201d O\u2019Rourke replied.\n\nMilitary-style weapons like the AR-15 and AK-47 have been used repeatedly in many of the country\u2019s most deadly mass shootings \u2015 including last month\u2019s massacre in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hometown of El Paso, Texas, that claimed 22 lives.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re shot with one of those high-impact, high-velocity rounds, it blows a hole out your system the size of an orange. It shreds everything inside. Then why is it OK to leave 10 million of them on the street if you agree that it is a potential instrument of terror?\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nBeto O'Rourke: 'Hell Yes, We're Going To Take Your AR-15'\n\nLate Night Hosts Nail The Most Meme-able Moments From The Democratic Debate\n\nAnalysis: Joe Biden Looks Like A Front-Runner, Until He Doesn't\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
