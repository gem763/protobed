For many mayors who end up in the president's crosshairs, it's a balancing act as they try to determine how to ward off criticism as well as Trump administration policies they think may be harmful while not jeopardizing federal funds earmarked for city projects.\n\nNational Los Angeles Has A Homeless Problem, Now The Trump Administration Is Getting Involved Los Angeles Has A Homeless Problem, Now The Trump Administration Is Getting Involved Listen \u00b7 3:56 3:56\n\nFor example, Trump raised plenty of hackles with his recent comments about the homeless in California hurting the prestige of Los Angeles and San Francisco. Darrell Steinberg, chairperson of California's State Commission on Homelessness and Supportive Housing, calls the president's statements hypocritical.\n\n\"This is a president who is calling for the elimination of the Community Development Block Grant Program which is a primary source of funding for affordable housing,\" says Steinberg, who is also the mayor of Sacramento.\n\nLast week, Steinberg signed a letter on behalf of California's big cities, along with California Gov. Gavin Newsom. It asked the president to increase housing vouchers by the thousands for the state's low income residents. Steinberg says its time for any adversarial relationship between cities and the Trump administration to end.\n\n\"When it comes to homelessness there's only one thing that matters and that is bringing as many people under a roof as possible and helping them reclaim their lives,\" Steinberg says.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration rejected California's request. HUD Secretary Ben Carson wrote back, saying that the federal government is doing its part.\n\nHomelessness though is just one issue where the president's been on the attack He's also disparaged big cities led by Democrats for a variety of other problems. Recently, he blasted Baltimore for its economic and crime problems. He's been particularly harsh in condemning \"sanctuary cities\" for putting limits on cooperating with ICE, the country's immigration agency. Trump tried to block some of those cities, including Chicago, from receiving Justice Department funds often used to hire police officers and obtain services that law enforcement could not otherwise afford. He lost that battle in court.\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot says obviously the city needs help from the federal government, \"but we are not going to compromise our values in pursuit of federal dollars.\" Lightfoot says the president loses nothing by attacking cities, \"because he's not going to get any votes of large urban centers like the city of Chicago \u2014 some \u2014 but nothing that's actually going to profit him.\"\n\nIn Albuquerque, N.M., federal money helped fund a bus expansion program. Mayor Tim Keller says the city is appreciative of federal funds, but they only make up a small percentage of Albuquerque's nearly $1 billion budget.\n\n\"We're talking about less than .01 percent of our budget. So we're not worried about that funding\" because, Keller says, the city can get those dollars elsewhere. \"But also we believe in the rule of law and that's why we've joined the lawsuits with the U.S. Conference of Mayors to resist against the president trying to leverage funding for equipment for our law enforcement folks in exchange for immigration policy.\"\n\nWhile the relationship between Trump and some big cities remains adversarial, Bryan Barnett, the head of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and also mayor of Rochester Hills, Mich., says the goal is to actually be partners with the president.\n\n\"Our first posture is always to collaborate and work together and find a shared success,\" Barrett says. \"But if need be we will make sure our voices are heard and that we represent the people who live in our cities,\" Barnett says.\n\nNo rapprochement is likely anytime soon. More than two dozens cities and states are joining California and suing the Trump administration over rolling back emission standards.", "description": "Mayors of some of the cities the president targets say they aren't worried about jeopardizing federal funding and will continue fighting the rhetoric and policies they believe will harm urban areas.", "authors": ["Cheryl Corley"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/23/ap_19230678454967_wide-ca9be1036c020b3ab2594fe337dfae6981af96cd.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
