(Lucas Jackson/Reuters)\n\nThe NRA\u2019s problems have little to do with the typical criticisms hurled at it by its biggest detractors.\n\nThe National Rifle Association has big troubles. It\u2019s wildly in debt. The attorney general of New York \u2014 where the NRA was founded in 1871 and where it remains incorporated \u2014 is investigating the tax-exempt status of what she has called a \u201cterrorist organization.\u201d The NRA\u2019s longtime chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, is in a bitter feud with its outgoing president, Oliver North. Accusations are flying, including of attempted extortion and misuse of perhaps millions of dollars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the surface, the NRA\u2019s problems have little to do with the typical criticisms hurled at it by its biggest detractors. To them, the villainous NRA is too rich, too powerful, and too well-run, not an outfit drowning in red ink and dysfunction. But it turns out that its real problems, in part, may stem from its outsized ambitions.\n\nFor most of its history, the NRA was a sporting club dedicated to teaching gun safety and promoting hunting and marksmanship as a pastime. It was founded by two Union Army officers who had noticed that the Confederates tended to be better shots. In the 1930s, it started to dip its toes into lobbying, but in favor of limited gun control. The NRA, for instance, supported the Federal Firearms Act of 1938, which established federal gun licensing requirements. It wasn\u2019t until the mid-1970s, after passage of the federal Gun Control Act, that new leadership at the NRA made lobbying for gun rights central to its mission.\n\nStill, that mission was notably bipartisan. Working from the common-sense assumption that gun rights would be better protected if support came from both parties, the NRA once supported candidates on either side of the aisle. In the 2000 campaign cycle, it spent $372,000 on some 66 Democratic incumbents. But by 2016, it contributed to just four.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happened? The easy answer is that as the GOP increasingly embraced gun rights, the Democrats embraced gun control \u2014 or the other way around. Which side is guilty of policy extremism depends on your views on gun policy. Asking which side is guilty of rhetorical extremism is pointless, because both are. The NRA is not a \u201cterrorist organization,\u201d but neither are its opponents a horde of anarchists, socialists, and goons, as the NRA\u2019s media arm often portrays them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe GOP-NRA alliance came downstream from two larger social shifts. The first is the \u201cBig Sort\u201d \u2014 shorthand for how American society has self-organized not just into \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d regions, but also worldviews. The end of the NRA\u2019s bipartisan lobbying strategy simply reflected the facts on the ground. In 1989, 64 percent of Republicans had a favorable view of the NRA, and so did 49 percent of Democrats. Today, those numbers are 88 percent and 24 percent, respectively.\n\nThe second reason is that the parties are weaker than they have ever been. The common assertion that Republican politicians are pro-gun because they\u2019ve been bought off with NRA blood money is mostly a paranoid conspiracy theory. The NRA doesn\u2019t actually give very much money to politicians, at least compared with, say, organized labor or trial lawyers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat the NRA does do \u2014 incredibly effectively \u2014 is organize and inform voters, mobilizing them to vote reliably for philosophically aligned candidates. Historically, that was a function of political parties, but now it\u2019s been largely outsourced to special-interest groups such as the NRA but also Planned Parenthood for the Democrats. These groups are motivated to get out the vote, but they\u2019re also incentivized to monetize the voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe net effect has been for these interest groups to go all in for the culture war \u2014 which is highly effective for fundraising \u2014 and take our elections with them.\n\nNRA folks today inveigh against \u201cthe socialists\u201d with the same vehemence they used to reserve for gun-grabbers. UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, author of Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America, observes that NRATV, the online media outlet of the NRA, has strayed far from the gun lane. \u201cNow it\u2019s focused on immigration, race, health care,\u201d he told The New Republic. Dana Loesch, an NRA spokeswoman, has called the mainstream news media \u201cthe rat bastards of the earth\u201d who deserve to be \u201ccurb-stomped.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way since William F. Buckley came out in favor of the Brady Bill.\n\nPolitical parties once had the desire and resources to manage their own brands \u2014 keeping activists and interests at a more healthy distance. Those days are gone. Parties \u2014 and the institutions that really run them \u2014 are simply uniforms for combatants in the culture war. In such a climate, it\u2019s no surprise that things such as good corporate governance became an afterthought at the NRA.\n\n\u00a9 2019 TRIBUNE CONTENT AGENCY LLC", "description": "The NRA doesn\u2019t actually give very much money to politicians.
