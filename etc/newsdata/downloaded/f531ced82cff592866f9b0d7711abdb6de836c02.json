More than ever, designers are championing individuality and personal expression on the catwalk and within each collection \u2014 even with hair and makeup; at many shows the beauty look was customized to each model rather than uniformly applied. The old rules, such as creating merchandising groupings and repeating fabrics and silhouettes a certain number of times to communicate cohesion, are not as strictly adhered to anymore.\n\nStill, there are a number of visual themes and design ideas that seem to connect the best collections of the season, and trends that seem to resonate from New York to London, and beyond. Here are the fashion trends you'll be seeing everywhere come Spring/Summer 2020.\n\nHead-to-toe colour\n\nMany designers embraced bright colours, particularly orange, for Spring/Summer 2020. Others stuck with saturated but more muted hues, but used them in bold, head-to-toe combinations (accessories included!). As seen at shows including Boss, Max Mara, Balenciaga and Herm\u00e8s, this trend is one way to create impact with easy-to-wear pieces that, on their own, might not be considered as fashion forward.\n\nBoxy blazers\n\nOversized blazers have been trending for a few seasons, but for spring you may want to look out for woven jackets with wide, exaggerated shoulders that look like they're sticking out a bit. There might even be some shoulder pads involved! We spotted this tailored trend at Balmain, Chlo\u00e9, Proenza Schouler and other shows.\n\nThe key to pulling off this look for real life? Layer the OTT blazer over something fitted or abbreviated, like a slip dress or tailored shorts. Did we mention that short suits are also in fashion next season?\n\nPolka dots\n\nPerhaps it's the Zara dress effect? Or, more likely, we're seeing polka dots in all sizes everywhere for Spring/Summer 2020 because they're fun and easy to wear. And, it's a versatile pattern that complements both avant-garde designs and more traditional, retro-inspired garments. As seen at Sacai, Michael Kors, Altuzarra, Dries Van Noten, Maison Margiela and several other collections, this might just be the one trend you'll see everywhere come spring.\n\nHave a few polka dot items in your wardrobe and want to give them a quick update? Try mixing different-sized patterns in one outfit, or matching a white-on-black with a black-on-white pattern.\n\nWaistcoats and vests\n\nPerhaps it's time to reconsider the 3-piece suit. Vests and waistcoats \u2014 which are similar pieces, except that the latter is intended to be worn with a shirt under and is usually offered as part of a 3-piece suit \u2014 were ubiquitous on the catwalks in the last month, after years of being out of fashion in womenswear.\n\nThere were classic, tailored versions presented at Saint Laurent, Rag & Bone and Gucci, whereas at Celine and Tommy Hilfiger casual vests are also shown layered over a loose-fitting blouse.\n\nBra tops\n\nBeyond the crop top, we spotted countless bra and tube tops everywhere for Spring/Summer 2020 for both day and evening. At some shows, they were worn solo, whereas in other collections the bras were styled under oversized blazers as a top or shirt alternative. And if you're not comfortable showing so much skin, at Dion Lee they were even layered on top of a lightweight, sheer knit.\n\nFlap shoulder bags\n\nDrawstring bags, micro bags and oversized totes are still trending, but it was the classic, single-flap shoulder bag that ruled the accessories scene for spring at shows like Christian Dior, Coach 1941, Fendi, and Valentino. Made in long-lasting leather, these structured bags are perfect for everyday wear, and it's also a great bag to invest in if you're only going to buy one designer accessory, thanks to the style's functionality and timeless appeal.\n\nPro tip: This is the perfect time to look online and in vintage stores for a similar, second-hand version from some of the same designers.\n\nStatement eyewear\n\nDesigners embraced both sunglasses and optical glasses with abandon this season. And not just classic styles with a simple logo \u2014 the best eyewear was quirky, colourful, and added a ton of personality to every outfit. In particular, the ones at Acne Studios, Bottega Veneta, Givenchy, Gucci, and Stella McCartney stood out.\n\nIf you're not looking to invest in new eyewear, another way to update your glasses for the season is to add a bold chain. Believe it or not, those are going to be in fashion, too.\n\nTruc Nguyen is a Toronto-based writer, editor and stylist.
