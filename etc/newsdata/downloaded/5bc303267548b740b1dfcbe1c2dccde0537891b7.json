It said the shipments index fell, the new orders index rose and the employment index climbed 17 points. The average workweek index fell and so did the prices paid index and the prices received index.\n\nThe future general activity diffusion index rose to 33.8, 13 points higher. The Philly Fed said that more than 43% of firms think activity over the next six months will expand. The future indexes for capital spending, new orders and shipments all rose and the future employment index decreased.\n\nWrite to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 17, 2019 09:34 ET (13:34 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
