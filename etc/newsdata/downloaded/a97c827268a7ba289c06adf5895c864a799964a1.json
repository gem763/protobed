Afterwards we talked about why he shared this story, what his intentions were by doing so and if this was something he had seen himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s important that the kids understand the power of their words so that they can relay their own reality, but also inspire change.\n\nRecurring themes are aspirations, independence, dreams and generally ideas and values that help them feel belonging.\n\nWhen the focus is on foster care specifically, stories range from being about gratitude for their foster carers to \u2018wanting to go home\u2019 because they feel invisible.\n\nI try not to be too preachy as the kids are smart enough to know what they want from their music, and I never force the words from them. I\u2019m only there to guide them with their message and intentions.\n\nThe hardest aspect is usually the transition from foster care to independent living \u2013 many young people tell me that they don\u2019t get enough support (Picture: Ric Flo)\n\nYoung people will often open up if you pay attention to their interests.\n\nFor instance, there was one particular person who wasn\u2019t very engaged with writing rap songs, but always talked about Fortnight, so I told him to just write about that, in whatever shape he wanted. That became the starting point \u2013 then we brainstormed on other things that he could use for his writing.\n\nThe fact that the young people do this as a group activity also opens up conversations about their experience, which then allows them to digest their own and other people\u2019s stories. This way, they know that they\u2019re not alone in how they feel.\n\nThey\u2019re also encouraged to be team players; it\u2019s pretty difficult for one new songwriter to make a decent song in a day, but between a group of six to eight people, they\u2019re given more room to try different ideas and improve their flow.\n\nEvery young person has a unique story; sometimes their parent isn\u2019t fit to look after them because of domestic violence and some have an illness that prevents them from being able to take care of their kids.\n\nSome of them have even formed music groups and collectives together \u2013 I\u2019m happy that the impact has gone beyond our workshop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe main point of the workshops is to give young people a positive, creative experience that not only informs who they are, but speaks a language that they enjoy and creates music that they can cherish beyond this experience.\n\nIf there is enough funding, they do on occasion perform their songs at the annual \u2018Looked After Children\u2019 awards. Some have also worked with Soundstorm Music Education Agency and performed their pieces at a festival.\n\nEvery young person has a unique story; sometimes their parent isn\u2019t fit to look after them because of domestic violence and some have an illness that prevents them from being able to take care of their kids.\n\nThe hardest aspect is usually the transition from foster care to independent living. Many tell me that they don\u2019t get enough support.\n\nArtists who have been in similar positions \u2013 in foster care or homeless \u2013 should hone into their stories to help young people who need someone to look up to.\n\nThey should make it clear that \u2018I have had mad experiences just like you but don\u2019t let that determine your future\u2019 so that these kids become determined to make changes in their lives.\n\nRap as a creative expression can boost young people\u2019s confidence, self-esteem and sense of belonging, as well as expand their interest in English literature, poetry and storytelling.\n\nThrough empowering music, I want to change the narrative of foster kids from being labelled victims to resilient young superheros.\n\nRic Flo is one third of the Hip Hop trio Jungle Brown, which has just released its second album \u2018Full Circle\u2019 on Mr Bongo Records.\n\nMORE: The earlier we educate children about what it means to be LGBT the better\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: If children can, why can\u2019t we confront our prejudices?\n\nMORE: I want kids in care to read this and know they can exceed society\u2019s expectations", "description": "Ric Flo used rapping as a way to cope when he was a foster child and now runs workshops for kids who have gone through similar experiences.", "authors": ["Ric Flo"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/52608924_2555986147751982_6539828577133658112_o-0e66_1570795107.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
