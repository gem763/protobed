MORE\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria would not embolden Tehran.\n\nWhen pressed repeatedly by senators on the Foreign Relations Committee, special envoy Brian Hook said Trump\u2019s retreat from Syria would not affect the administration\u2019s so-called maximum pressure campaign against Iran.\n\n\u201cWe are very comfortable with our Iran strategy in Syria,\u201d Hook told the committee.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump\u2019s decision \u201cdoes not hurt our Iran strategy,\u201d he added.\n\nPressed again later in the hearing, Hook said \u201cwe do not believe that it changes the dynamic with Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s decision with respect to Syria is not going to change our Iran strategy or the efficacy of it,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has ordered all U.S. troops in northern Syria to withdraw, paving the way for Turkey to launch an offensive against Kurdish forces that were instrumental in the U.S.-led fight against ISIS.\n\nIn the wake of that decision, the Kurds have made a deal with Syrian government and Russian forces to move into the area to protect them from Turkey.\n\nU.S. officials have long said one of the goals of the U.S. presence in Syria was to curb Iran\u2019s influence in the Middle East. Tehran has troops in Syria supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country\u2019s 8-year civil war.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Hook claimed that \u201cour forces in northeast Syria have never had an Iran mission set.\u201d\n\nDespite Hook\u2019s insistences, senators in both parties were unconvinced.\n\n\u201cI presume Iran was smiling from ear to ear as Turkey rushed into Syria,\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyDemocrats fear Ohio slipping further away in 2020 Poll shows Michelle Obama would lead in New Hampshire if she entered 2020 Democratic race Trump's GOP impeachment firewall holds strong MORE (R-Utah) said.\n\n\u201cThings are not better for Iran in the Middle East as we have gone, as Turkey has hit the Kurds and the Kurds have now allied with Assad?\u201d a disbelieving Romney pressed Hook. \u201cSurely Assad is stronger. And this isn\u2019t good for Iran?\u201d\n\nHook responded, saying: \u201cOur military is in Syria for ISIS. Our diplomacy is focused on Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear you, but diplomacy has impact if there\u2019s a military that\u2019s strong and in the region,\u201d Romney replied. \u201cThat\u2019s a dramatic perspective on your part, that Iran is not celebrating what\u2019s happening in Syria.\u201d\n\nSen.
