Common Drug Test Can't Tell the Difference", "language": "en", "text": "In June of 2018, Mark Pennington received troubling news from his ex-girlfriend, with whom he shared custody of their 2-year-old son. She had taken a hair follicle from the boy, she said, and had it analyzed at a lab. A drug test had returned positive for THC, the intoxicating compound in marijuana; evidently their son had been exposed to it, presumably in Pennington\u2019s presence. He was told that, from then on, he would be permitted to see the child only once a week, and under supervision.\n\n\u201cI was mortified,\u201d Pennington recalled recently. \u201cMy jaw hit the floor. I just knew from the bottom of my heart I hadn\u2019t gotten any THC in my son\u2019s system.\u201d\n\nHowever, Pennington had been providing his son with honey infused with cannabidiol, or CBD, a nonintoxicating compound that, like THC, is found in varying amounts in the plant known as cannabis. THC is federally illegal and until recently so was all cannabis.\n\nBut in December, the Farm Bill legalized hemp \u2014 cannabis that contains less than 0.3% THC. With that, CBD became legal. It can now be found at stores across the country, in everything from tinctures and massage oils to coffee and makeup. Pennington, who lives in Colorado, where growing hemp for CBD has been legal since 2014, worked for Colorado Hemp Honey, a company that sells CBD-infused raw honey across the country.\n\nPennington was despondent about possibly losing custody of his child, until he spoke with Frank Conrad, the chief technology officer and lab director at Colorado Green Lab, a scientific consultant to the cannabis industry. Conrad directed him to a little-known study published in 2012 in the Journal of Analytical Toxicology that showed that a common forensic drug testing method could easily mistake the presence of CBD for THC. In short, the drug testing lab may have erred; it was entirely possible that the CBD Pennington had given his child had caused the drug test to produce a false positive for THC.\n\nTwo chemists with Cascade Chemistry, a private chemical-research company in Eugene, Oregon, independently reviewed the study for The New York Times and confirmed the validity of the potential drug testing problem.\n\nWith Conrad as an expert witness, Pennington won equal custody. Now, on behalf of his son, he plans to sue the lab that did the drug test, to raise awareness of the problematic testing method, which could have broad implications for average Americans as CBD becomes mainstream.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even estimate how many people this is going to screw over,\u201d said Conrad, who has worked on a handful of cases similar to Pennington\u2019s. (He is not working with Pennington on the lawsuit against the lab.) In one case Conrad consulted on, a couple in Florida was charged with marijuana possession after a CBD-infused gummy bear tested positive for THC. Another client was arrested for violating his parole after testing positive for THC, when he claimed he had only used CBD.\n\nIn every court case in which Conrad has explained the problem with this specific drug testing method, prosecutors have dropped the charges.\n\n\u201cAnyone who\u2019s on probation getting a random urine test \u2014 if this happens to them and they\u2019re taking CBD oil, they\u2019re going back to jail,\u201d Conrad said.\n\nBruce Houlihan, director of the Orange County, California, crime lab and chair of the emerging drugs and opioids committee for the American Society of Crime Lab Directors, expressed concern.\n\n\u201cIf any labs are using this method, they\u2019ll have to be careful,\u201d Houlihan said. He added that there was no way to estimate how many drug testing labs might be accidentally mistaking CBD for THC, because forensic labs generally determine their methodology in house.\n\nIt is also difficult to estimate how many people in a year have suffered negative consequences, such as the loss of a job or parental rights, after testing positive for THC, because most drug testing data is private. Even data that is public can be difficult to parse. For instance, in many locales, official statistics around \u201cdrugged driving\u201d do not distinguish between drivers who test positive for THC and those who test positive for other drugs, such as cocaine or methamphetamine.\n\nNonetheless, a drug test that identifies CBD as THC could have serious consequences. Even in states that have legalized marijuana, it remains legal for employers, child protective services, public housing authorities and other entities to test for THC. And in a survey conducted earlier this year by the investment bank Cowen, 7% of adults in the U.S. \u2014 17 million people \u2014 reported using CBD.", "description": "In June of 2018, Mark Pennington received troubling news from his ex-girlfriend, with whom he shared custody of their 2-year-old son.
