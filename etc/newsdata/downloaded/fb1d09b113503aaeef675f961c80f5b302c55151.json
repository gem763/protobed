The gloss to a win that bolstered West Ham\u2019s early season positivity came late on when Aaron Cresswell picked out David de Gea\u2019s top corner with a beautifully executed 25-yard free-kick and, in a heartbeat, the United inquest could begin.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r had injury problems and they would worsen when Marcus Rashford was forced off with a groin complaint. But the team he sent out singularly failed to impose themselves, lacking tempo and incision in the final third. This was a performance scarred by sloppiness, by errors, and the club\u2019s away days woes go on. They have lost four and drawn three of their last seven Premier League games away from Old Trafford, equalling their longest run in the competition without a win.\n\nWest Ham have not enjoyed a particularly good recent record against the established top six \u2013 this was only their fourth win in 21 fixtures \u2013 but the home crowd could bellow out the Ol\u00e9s at the end while United\u2019s Ole cringed in embarrassment.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nUnited had suffered here last September in a 3-1 defeat that widened the cracks of the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho era and it was a similar story again. Mourinho was watching as a TV pundit and it is fair to say he would not have wanted to dwell on that day, when he started with Scott McTominay on the right of a back three and watched his one-paced team show a basic lack of hunger and drive.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r played McTominay in a central midfield two alongside Nemanja Matic \u2013 in the continued injury-enforced absence of Paul Pogba \u2013 believing that it gave United the foundation to play but one of the big questions was always going to be whether his lineup had the energy and creativity to hurt West Ham. Anthony Martial was also unavailable and from the early stages it felt as though Rashford would have to feed on scraps. So it proved.\n\nManuel Pellegrini\u2019s team had a nice balance, with Declan Rice in front of the back four and menace from the flanks in Yarmolenko and Felipe Anderson. West Ham have often proved a tough nut to crack this season and for long spells the action meandered.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andriy Yarmolenko scores his side\u2019s first goal.

Daniel James turned sharply to find Rashford and, when Issa Diop missed his slide challenge, the United striker had yards to sprint into. Rice, though, had read the danger. He eased back and across to snuff out Rashford, a celebration of understated efficiency.\n\nWest Ham sought to keep the back door closed by whatever means necessary, with Angelo Ogbonna taking out Andreas Pereira to collect a yellow card as United broke and Diop flattening James after misreading a ball. Mark Noble was high and late on Aaron Wan-Bissaka in the 74th minute and was perhaps fortune to receive only a booking.\n\nChelsea v Liverpool: Premier League \u2013 live! Read more\n\nWho could find the key to the defensive lock? It was West Ham with a move of precision and quality just before half-time. With Pereira standing off him, Noble found Anderson and he was in perfect sync with Yarmolenko. When Anderson flicked the ball on his teammate was already on the move, using his first touch to power away from Harry Maguire. Yarmolenko\u2019s finish was angled low into the far corner.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r sent his players out early for the second-half \u2013 a telltale sign of managerial dissatisfaction \u2013 but things got worse for him when Rashford pulled up in the 59th minute with a groin problem. He had played virtually every minute of United\u2019s season up to that point, including the full game against Astana in the Europa League on Thursday. Did the strain get to him? With Mason Greenwood absent because of tonsillitis, Solskj\u00e6r sent on Jesse Lingard to lead the line.\n\nWest Ham could sit a little deeper and look to counter and it almost bore fruit when Anderson played a give-and-go with Yarmolenko before working De Gea at the near post.\n\nFor United, Juan Mata stretched but could not apply a decisive touch to a Pereira cross while Maguire shot low and too close to Lukasz Fabianski on 69 minutes after a corner had been worked to him. It was a bad miss \u2013 entirely in keeping with United\u2019s day.", "description": "A goal in each half from Andriy Yarmolenko and Aaron Cresswell secured a rousing 2-0 home win for West Ham over Manchester United", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb87daf4852bb75b2cdc488cdfad3c6b99a09252/285_114_3819_2292/master/3819.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=11dcdf36f91f4186d214c82dea8681ff", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
