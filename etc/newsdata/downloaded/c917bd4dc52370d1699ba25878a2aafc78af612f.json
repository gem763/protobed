This is, of course, a myth, but in the face of pervasive kawaii culture, the overwhelming social pressure to be thin, and the uniformity of idol groups like AKB48, it\u2019s not hard to see how this damaging idea gets perpetuated.\n\nThe \u201cideal Japanese woman\u201d is relentlessly depicted as adorable, fashionable, organized, submissive, straight, soft-spoken (think lovable Japanese darling, Marie Kondo), and above all else, of pure Japanese descent. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with this image, painting it as the definition for all Japanese women is.\n\nDespite this, these six modern women are evolving on the work of the renowned women who helped shape Japan\u2019s history by shaking up the stereotype and redefining what it means to be Japanese.\n\n1. Naomi Osaka: The title-winning tennis star representing Japan\n\nFlip on the TV and nine out of ten times you\u2019ll see a commercial featuring professional tennis player Naomi Osaka.\n\nRepresenting Japan, Osaka has risen to worldwide stardom in recent years for her mad skills on the court. At just 22 years old, she\u2019s the first Asian player to hold a top rank in the tennis singles category. In 2018, Osaka shocked the world when she defeated her idol Serena Williams in a controversial match.\n\nOsaka was born in Osaka (of course) but moved to the US when she was three, so she holds dual citizenship. However, because she lacks the pale complexion typical of Asian women\u2014her mother is Japanese and her father Haitian\u2014Osaka has received both praise and hate from her native country.\n\nAn animated ad created by Japanese noodle giant Nissin features a whitewashed version of Osaka. Despite Nissin apologizing and claiming they meant no harm, the ad caused quite the controversy. More recently, a Japanese comedic duo joked her skin \u201cneeded some bleach.\u201d Naomi\u2019s excellent Twitter response proves one can care about beauty without being superficial\u2014or racist.\n\nIt\u2019s as if, in order for Osaka to be accepted into Japanese society, some people are trying to change her appearance to force her to fit in. Yet, despite the hate, Osaka has won four titles, continues to be a strong representative of Japan in the world of sports, and is still kicking ass both on the court and in life.\n\n2.
