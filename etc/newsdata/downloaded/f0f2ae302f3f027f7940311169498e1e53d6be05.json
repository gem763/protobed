It\u2019s a terrible thing going on in our country \u2014 no crimes \u2014 it\u2019s an investigation in search of a crime.\u201d\n\nThe comparison came after Trump caused a furor earlier this week by comparing the impeachment inquiry to a \u201clynching.\u201d Tishaura Jones, the Democratic co-chair of the host group, the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center, condemned his comments as being \u201cin poor taste\u201d and \u201cinflammatory,\u201d but the group didn\u2019t disinvite Trump from delivering his speech at the historically black college.\n\nTrump used much of his address to defend his signature criminal justice reform law, after traveling down to South Carolina for a speech tailored to appeal to African American voters ahead of his reelection campaign.\n\nIn remarks at the 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum, a title that alluded to the landmark criminal justice reform legislation he signed into law last year, the First Step Act, the president acknowledged that criminal justice was not \u201cinitially\u201d a pillar of his first campaign.\n\nBut he told the audience that once he took office, he heard from \u2014 and was sold on the idea \u2014 by religious, local and law enforcement leaders who implored him to tackle injustices in the criminal justice system \u201con behalf of this forgotten community.\u201d\n\nThe president used much of his remarks to applaud local politicians in attendance at the event, and stepped aside multiple times to allow for a few words from several attendees who had been released from prison as a result of the First Step Act. He also brought up Alice Johnson, who was released from prison after intervention from Kim Kardashian West.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m standing here today saying this is what a second chance looks like,\u201d she told the audience.\n\nThe president was awarded the Bipartisan Justice Award at the top of his speech, telling the audience later that the prize would sit at a \u201cvery high level\u201d in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump touted his efforts to assemble \u201ca historic coalition\u201d of lawmakers last year to shepherd the First Step Act through Congress, an effort headed in the White House by Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner. \u201cWe had them so liberal you couldn't believe it and so conservative you couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Trump said of congressional supporters of the bill.\n\nKushner attended the speech and could be seen at the side of the room applauding frequently throughout Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nTrump was also accompanied on the trip by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who had previously represented a South Carolina district in Congress, HUD Secretary Ben Carson, national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), social media director Dan Scavino and Rep. Ralph Norman.\n\nThe conference will hear this weekend from a number of Democratic presidential candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\nTrump has been making a hard play to get African Americans to vote for him next year, even though he received only 8 percent of that group\u2019s vote in 2016. Late this past summer, the Trump campaign quietly reached out to prominent African Americans about joining a coalition to help increase Republican support in the black community.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign is telling African Americans they should disregard the president\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric and instead focus on the strong economy, the passage of criminal justice reform, record low unemployment among African Americans and the creation of Opportunity Zones designed to increase investment in poorer cities.\n\nTrump touted many of these accomplishments on Friday in a broader pitch to African American voters.\n\nHe finished his remarks with a pitch to African American voters similar to one he made ahead of the 2016 election: \u201cI\u2019m gonna say it: Vote for me. What the hell do you have to lose?\u201d he asked, citing statistics of low unemployment among African Americans.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

He argued that higher rates of unemployment can be a barrier to re-entering society from prisonand that the availability of jobs could lower rates of recidivism.\n\nOther efforts to attract African American voters have taken the form of numerous events at the White House in recent months. In September, Trump told leaders of historically black colleges and universities that his administration\u2019s commitment to helping them was \u201cbigger and better and stronger than any previous administration by far.\u201d And earlier this month, Trump also held an event with almost 300 young black supporters at the White House who broke out into chants of \u201cfour more years!\u201d\n\nBut such efforts come as one Quinnipiac University poll showed in July that 80 percent of African American voters believe Trump is a racist. Trump\u2019s attacks this summer on four freshman congresswomen of color and his barbs against the late House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, in which he called Baltimore a \u201crodent infested mess\u201d haven\u2019t helped matters. In the first year of his administration, he was universally condemned for saying there were \u201cvery fine people\u201d among the neo-Nazis and white nationalists who had marched in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nTrump has expressed doubts about the political benefits of his criminal justice reform efforts. He privately told campaign advisers late this spring that he wasn\u2019t interested in talking about the reform law because he didn\u2019t think it has resonated with his base. \u201cIt was clear he thinks it\u2019s a total dud,\u201d said a person familiar with the meeting. \u201cHe made it abundantly clear he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s worth talking about.\u201d He\u2019s also has accused Democrats of trying to steal credit for the bill.\n\nOn Friday, he appeared to allude to that sentiment, telling the audience that he was still unsure whether pushing the First Step Act was the politically popular thing to do. \u201cBut I know it was the right thing,\u201d he said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/3754/1155968404_6097887915001_6097890592001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
