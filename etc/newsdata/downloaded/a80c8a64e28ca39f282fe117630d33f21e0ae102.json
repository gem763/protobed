(AP Photo/Jim Young)\n\nShohei Ohtani\u2019s season is over.\n\nThe Los Angeles Angels designated hitter will undergo surgery on Friday to adress a bipartite patella in his left knee, the team announced Thursday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOhtani will have reportedly have an 8-12 week timetable to recover, so his season is over.\n\nA bipartite patella is a condition in which the patella, more commonly known as the kneecap, doesn\u2019t fuse together in early childhood and remains seperated. The condition \u2014 which occurs in 2-3 percent of the population \u2014 is often asymptomatic, but it was clearly a problem for Ohtani.\n\nAt 67-80 and 28 games out of first place, the Angels had little reason to keep Ohtani on the field.\n\nShohei Ohtani\u2019s half-season comes to an end\n\nThe Angels will certainly miss Ohtani, but they have plenty of reason to be more excited about seeing him take the field next year.\n\nEven though he played for much of the season, this was always going to be a limited performance from Ohtani due to his Tommy John surgery last year. Rather than use his two-way talents, Ohtani worked solely as a designated hitter this year.\n\nThe 25-year-old still performed quite well for a player in his position, hitting .286/.343/.505, 18 home runs and the first cycle from a Japanese player in MLB history. He figures to deliver even more value next year when he starts pitching again.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Angels phenom's season will end after a year of full-time designated hitter duty.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hmDflrqCic91ypIsKruIZw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AAZf1mXjQu6_zwdeqalOyQ--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/272e2fa0-d5a1-11e9-b6fe-86784a491ccc", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
