Boris Johnson is over three months into the job but has only got round to doing it the once.\n\nThe last time it happened, technically, was three weeks ago, at the precise moment he was giving his party conference speech, an unfortunate timetabling clash that was the direct consequence of his having tried and failed to shut down parliament.\n\nThat was considered a democratic outrage, at the time, but anyone tuning in today could hardly fail to see the upside in such a strategy.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe purpose of these occasions, we are led to believe, is for the whole house and, in particular, the leader of the opposition, to scrutinise the government by asking the prime minister difficult questions.\n\nTraditionally, Johnson\u2019s tactic in such situations, over many years in public life, has been to create what he calls a \u201cblonde wall of noise\u201d \u2013 to just overwhelm all would-be challengers with a tornado of bluster.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t work so well in the House of Commons as it does in television interviews, but he has a new tactic, which is equally effective. And that is just to lie.\n\nIt really works. How can anyone hope to land a blow on you when you\u2019ve liberated yourself from even the most basic requirement to say anything that anyone might conceivably think to be true.\n\nThere he stood, stating with complete clarity, on many occasions, that the government is still committed to \u201cleaving the EU by October 31st\u201d. As he spoke, the Conservative Party was sending out a little tub-thumping email to all its members, saying \u201cLabour has delayed Brexit again\u201d. He also spent the morning both in a meeting with Jeremy Corbyn, where the two of them failed to agree on a new timetable for Brexit, and on the phone to EU leaders, discussing the request for a delay to Brexit he had personally sent them, in a letter he had refused to sign, like an unimaginably petulant toddler.\n\nIt was, in its way, Prime Minister\u2019s Questions in the style of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\u2019s End. That movie loses much of its dramatic tension once death stops becoming an obstacle to life. How much edge is there to be found in a sword fight, for example, when the vanquished party just pops over the edge of the world and then comes back reborn?\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He is, at time of writing, \u201cstill committed to leaving the European Union on October 31st\u201d even though he knows it can\u2019t be done.\n\nAnd now that that can\u2019t be done, even though he\u2019s still claiming he\u2019s going to do it, he and his No 10 pals next ruse is to claim he will be \u201ccalling a general election before Christmas\u201d. He\u2019s already tried and failed to call one of those. There\u2019s absolutely no reason at all to imagine anything has changed that means he can just call one now. He can\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s all just noise and shouting. Say whatever you like in the hope that someone\u2019s listening. Doesn\u2019t matter that none of it\u2019s true because the person who hears it probably won\u2019t know that.\n\nThere will be a general election, at some point, and we know that this will be the strategy. Dominic Cummings has done it before and he\u2019ll do it again. Already we have seen the Conservatives\u2019 posters, pumped out on Facebook on Tuesday night and already shared 17,000 times.\n\n\u201cBoris\u2019s Brexit deal has passed parliament, but Labour have now voted to delay it,\u201d it says.\n\nIt is painful to have to point out that if it had passed parliament, it would already be law. It hasn\u2019t even come close to passing parliament. They know it, but they also know the people they want to lie to don\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s clear, right now, in late 2019, that big electoral events in big democratic countries happen at the mercy of social media, which nobody has yet worked out how to regulate or control.\n\nNo one quite knows when the general election is happening, but one thing we do know for certain. It will be yet another thermonuclear explosion of fear, lies and loathing. It is the Cummings way. The rest of us just have to live with the consequences.", "description": "A novel experience, on Wednesday at noon, when the prime minister rose at the despatch box for what is known as Prime Minister\u2019s Questions.
