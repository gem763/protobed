Coca-Cola rolled out two new Smartwater products, Smartwater Antioxidant and Smartwater Alkaline, exclusively on Boxed earlier this year. PepsiCo's Quaker Oats ran an A/B test on the platform, leading it to create new e-commerce packs for its products.\n\nRead more: Coca-Cola is debuting its new bottled water via the 'Costco for millennials' as Amazon tries to ditch water and other 'CRaP' products\n\n\"For us it's been great to be able to empower you ... and say, 'Hey, I want to spend this because I'm guaranteed a certain amount of ROI,\" Huang said. \"And we share that data ... how the packaging was, did folks really like it? What were the demographics of the folks that actually bought this?\"\n\nThe company has also started to build robotics for distribution centers and a front-end platform for shoppers, and it is growing its advertising business.", "description": "Boxed is giving brands and retailers analytics, data, and guaranteed return on investment on the platform, founder and CEO Chieh Huang said.", "authors": ["Tanya Dua"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c6c55a5342cca4ba13141fa-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
