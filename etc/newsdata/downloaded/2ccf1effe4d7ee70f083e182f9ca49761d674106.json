Sunday\u2019s game in Yokohama between host Japan and Scotland could also be scrapped, depending on the weather.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency is warning the powerful typhoon may bring torrential rain and strong winds to central parts of the country between Saturday and Sunday, coinciding with the last round of World Cup group games. It has urged people to take precautions to avoid potentially life-threatening danger. Airlines and train services anticipate cancellations in what is expected to be the most destructive typhoon of 2019.\n\nWorld Rugby tournament director Alan Gilpin said organizers had looked at all options, including moving the Yokohama and Toyota games to other venues, but it wasn\u2019t logistically possible in a fair way to all teams.\n\n\u201cWhile making every effort to put in place a contingency plan that would enable all of Saturday\u2019s matches to be played, it would be grossly irresponsible to leave teams, fans, volunteers \u2026 exposed during what is predicted to be a severe typhoon, Gilpin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken the very difficult decision but right decision to cancel matches in affected areas.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think it undermines (the quarterfinals) at all,\u201d he told a news conference.\n\nAll games canceled because of weather are logged as scoreless draws and each team will get two competition points, meaning Italy cannot finish better than third in Pool B and England will top Pool C without having to play France, despite both teams being unbeaten. Scotland needs to beat Japan to have any chance of reaching the playoffs. If the game is canceled, Japan and Ireland will advance to the knockout rounds.\n\nAll fans with tickets for a canceled match will receive a full refund. Organizers said every effort would be made to ensure all four matches on Sunday go ahead. A final decision is expected to be made Sunday morning.\n\nEngland coach Eddie Jones said he no problems with the tournament decision.\n\n\u201cOf course everyone is disappointed. We wanted to play France and we put a lot of work into that,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cWe have no issues, so we\u2019re getting on with it. It\u2019s a wonderful World Cup but you can\u2019t help typhoons.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s Pool D game between Australia and Georgia at Shizuoka and Saturday\u2019s game between Ireland and Samoa at Fukuoka will go ahead as scheduled.\n\nGilpin said all 20 teams were aware of the cancellation policies well before the World Cup kicked off, so he wasn\u2019t expecting any protests or legal comeback from teams deprived of games.\n\n\u201cAll the teams signed up to the participation agreement. They\u2019re well aware of the tournament rules,\u201d Gilpin said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a concern.\n\n\u201cWe always knew there would be risks (with the weather) but it\u2019s rare for there to be a typhoon of this size at this stage of the year. We have no regrets.\u201d\n\nThe logistics of moving 20 teams around a dozen cities and the geography involved diminished the possibility of last-minute changes to venues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complex. There\u2019s little flexibility, and that\u2019s why the tournament rules are as they are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some different opportunities if we have similar impacts in the knockout phase.\u201d\n\nTyphoon Hagibis had winds gusting up to 270 kilometers per hour (168 mph) Thursday morning. It is expected to weaken over cooler waters as it nears Japan\u2019s main island.\n\nJapan\u2019s central Pacific coast may see torrential rains beginning Friday and the high waves and tides may cause flooding. Japan is regularly hit by Pacific storms. Typhoon Faxai caused massive power outages in Chiba prefecture near Tokyo in September. Typhoon Jebi flooded a terminal and a runway at Kansai International Airport last year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The powerful typhoon that has caused the first ever cancellation of Rugby World Cup games has ended Italy's prospects of reaching the quarterfinals and could upset Scotland's chances of progressing to the knockout stages as well.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Pye"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/japan_asia_typhoon_44904_c0-86-2000-1252_s1770x1032.jpg?b05386dd4a3c1df68e87b552b7ec3fb2fc42b559", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
