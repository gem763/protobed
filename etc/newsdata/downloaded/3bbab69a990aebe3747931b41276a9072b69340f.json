However, this may have been due to improvements in the primary medical condition.\n\nThe authors suggest further research should study the effects of cannabinoids on anxiety and depression.\n\nAccording to the analysis, pharmaceutical THC - with or without CBD - worsened negative symptoms of psychosis in one study of 24 people, and did not significantly affect any other primary outcomes for the mental health disorders examined.\n\nIt also increased the number of people who had adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events, compared with placebo across all mental health disorders examined.\n\nScientists say there is a need for high-quality research to understand the effects of different cannabinoids on a range of outcomes for people with mental health disorders.\n\nThey highlight that their analysis and conclusions are limited by the small amount of available data, small study sizes, and the differences in findings between small studies.\n\nPress Association", "description": "There is inadequate evidence that cannabinoids relieve depression, anxiety disorders or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, scientists have said.", "authors": ["Nina Massey"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/15/istock-942439748.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
