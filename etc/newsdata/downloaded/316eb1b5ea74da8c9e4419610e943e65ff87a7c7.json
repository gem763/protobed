He worked on perfecting his beautifully gory looks for New York nightlife parties like Lady Fag\u2019s Holy Mountain and eventually began posting them to his @empty.pools Instagram account. Over the years, the elaborate masterpieces, made with materials like fake blood, chicken wire, glass, and piercings, have attracted him a notable following.\n\nBut before all the followers, Smith was a young punk kid with a love for graphic tees. He\u2019d make outfits by sewing together fabrics that he had screen-printed. He went on to chase a career in textile and print-making after attending the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, but realized that working in a textile design factory covered in sweat and paint wouldn\u2019t wholly satisfy his creativity. Slowly, Smith made his way into surveying the different ways of bringing his ideas to life. And before long, he\u2019d introduce a fresh way to wear and photograph jewelry, headpieces and various unconventional objects like pearls, metal, and paint.\n\nSmith views his art practice as one that exposes what\u2019s not under the mask, but what\u2019s beneath himself: a physical manifestation of how he\u2019s feeling, which ultimately becomes therapeutic. He allows his emotions to exist on the designs he decorates his face, only then exposed to his expertly-curated feed and now 100K+ followers on Instagram.\n\nHis username, \u201cempty.pools\" was inspired by a song he really liked by the musician Shlohmo. But, an underlying meaning of what Smith said some call his drag-like persona, empty.pools, represents less about its name and more about the internet.\n\n\u201cYou can have access to anything in the world online or through these channels and you can see it in front of your face, but it\u2019s not actually there,\u201d Smith said. So, Smith\u2019s concept is that, while a pool is meant to exist as something for fun and for celebration, the pool is empty. It\u2019s there, staring up at you, and you can\u2019t enjoy it.\n\nI asked Smith about his mindset and what the creation process of a look that he might upload to Instagram is like. He said it\u2019s all about purpose and planning, what he can do versus what we can\u2019t and how delving into his brain might offer the ability to make something so sublime not impossible.\n\n\n\n\u201cI like to explore different types of aesthetics,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf I\u2019m feeling crazy, sometimes, for me, the best thing is to just do something crazy, make something crazy. It\u2019s almost like getting it out and actually having it be on the forefront of myself. [For a look], I have the idea first, then I figure out the skill-set needed to do it second.\u201d\n\nFor his \u201cTechnologic\u201d look, he striped a rainbow pattern to his forehead, and draped it down around his jawline and his chin. Tiny multicolored lights pop around the center of his face, all placed above what projects a computer board or map. He is the machine, the power source. Then there\u2019s \u201cLove Lockdown\u201d, an elevated, campy troupe of airbrushed tattoos \u2014 a unicorn, Hello Kitty, a heart \u2014 that mix the whimsical nature, Renaissance-esque and all-around dark ambiance that Smith utilizes to inspire and generate his work.\n\nHe makes all his own designs. He produces the looks, from IRL to social media. He takes his own photos in his apartment (thank you self-timer), and he edits them on his computer. He\u2019s used scar wax to create special effects for looks like \u201cUnder the Skin\u201d \u2014 a \u201cfirst\u201d that tricks you into thinking he actually stuck sharp spikes through his cheeks. His images pull you in, but push you away \u2014 an almost shock effect caused from the beauty and the gross \u2014 and help depict Smith\u2019s fearless approach in expressing himself fully and artistically.\n\nPerformance in the public eye isn\u2019t without backlash, however. Comments claiming he\u2019s an alien or from hell \u2014 or that his art isn\u2019t art \u2014 drives a continued conversation around peoples\u2019 different interpretations of what art actually is. He breaks boundaries, and, with dedication, birthed his own rejection to pre-prescribed ideas of what art should or shouldn\u2019t be.\n\n\u201cI like the fact that I\u2019m so 'other,' I guess,\u201d said Smith. \u201cAnd I like that people like that. You don\u2019t have to place restrictions on yourself.\u201d", "description": "Artist Austin Smith's Instagram plays host to his fantastical creations, which include face piercings, tattoos, and fake blood.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dadcc045c1f5f000a31d042/social_lede/1571690633688-empty.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.5233xh;0xw,0.1887xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
