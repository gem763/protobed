I wanted to see if I could make that interesting and dramatic.\"\n\nDrifting away\n\n\"If you're an immigrant, you've likely come to a particular country for the sake of your children. You're willing to sacrifice for their sake. Then you find them drifting from you. You find that they judge you for your foreignness or how you misunderstand this new culture that you've brought them into. That's a particular type of pain that a parent would have to suffer. So there's a lot of that there in this book.\n\n\"There's father and children relationships in these stories \u2014 whether it's told from the perspective of the father or the child. It's trying to imagine my own father regarding me at a certain point in our lives and how he might have felt.\"\n\nSecond generation responsibilities\n\n\"When you're an immigrant child, you can feel like you've taken on a parental role, you're interpreting the culture and society for your parents who don't understand it as well as you can.\n\nYou feel a strong debt to your parents who have brought you over and now it's your turn to take care of them. -David Bezmozgis\n\n\"It's a class issue when you feel like if you've attained something, you have a responsibility for your family, be it your parents or your grandparents. It's true of a lot of immigrants who come here with very little. You feel a strong debt to your parents who have brought you over and now it's your turn to take care of them.\n\n\"That's an obligation that most children feel for their parents \u2014 or should under the best circumstances.\"\n\nDavid Bezmozgis's comments have been edited for length and clarity.", "description": "The Toronto writer's short story collection Immigrant City is a finalist for the 2019 Scotiabank Giller Prize.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4986688.1548092015!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/immigrant-city-by-david-bezmozgis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
