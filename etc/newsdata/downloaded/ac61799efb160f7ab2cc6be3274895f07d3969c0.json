He supposedly did this because he was essentially an unbeliever who thought that religion had no place in the public square.\n\nA couple of years ago, I teamed up with a pastor from Jefferson\u2019s home town of Charlottesville, Virginia, Dr. Mark Beliles, to write a book on the faith of our third president. The book is Doubting Thomas: The Religious Life and Legacy of Thomas Jefferson(MorganJames, 2014).\n\nThere are two main points to our book.\n\n1) Whatever serious doubts he may have privately held later in life, Jefferson was not a lifelong skeptic. In fact, when he was most productive and helpful to the country, he was from all outward appearances a practicing Christian. This would include when he wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom (1777, passed in 1786), which says that because of the example of the \u201choly author of our religion\u201d (Jesus), people should be free to believe or disbelieve.\n\n2) Regardless of whatever theological unorthodoxy he held (later in life), he did not believe in the separation of God and government\u2014which is the way the ACLU and other secularists try to portray him.\n\nFor example, on a regular basis, when he was president, Jefferson attended the Christian worship services held at the U.S. Capitol building\u2014services he approved of, which continued long after he was president.\n\nAs president, Jefferson took time one night in 1804 to cull through the sayings of Jesus as found in the four Gospels. Why did he do this?\n\nThe title he himself put on this unpublished work gives us a clue:The Philosophy of Jesus of Nazareth Extracted From the Account of His Life and Doctrines as Given by Matthew, Mark, Luke & John; Being an Abridgement of the New Testament for the Use of the Indians Unembarrassed with Matters of Fact or Faith Beyond the Level of Their Comprehensions.\n\nThis abridgment, clearly intended for the Indians, was not a biography of Jesus, only His \u201cphilosophy\u201d as the title states. As such it left out most material found in the Gospels that did not fit the goal of compiling a \u201cphilosophy,\u201d but there is no evidence of a motive to delete all of the miracles or evidences of Jesus\u2019 divinity.\n\nAs our third president, Jefferson had made the largest land addition in American history with the Louisiana Purchase. Suddenly, hundreds of thousands of Native-Americans, many of whom had never heard about Jesus, were added to American territory. He wanted them to benefit from the moral teachings of Jesus Christ.\n\nJefferson believed: \u201cOf all the systems of morality, ancient or modern, which have come under my observation, none appear to me so pure as that of Jesus.\u201d (Letter to William Canby, September 18, 1813).\n\nMuch thought in the Christian world has gone toward important theological matters like the nature of Christ (as fully divine and fully human), and the nature of the Godhead---Three Persons, One God (the Trinity). Jefferson felt (perhaps condescendingly) that such matters of theology and philosophy were beyond the Indians. As a result, he wanted to simplify Christ\u2019s teachings. He may have been misguided, but there\u2019s no evidence that his motive was secularization or anti-supernaturalism, as many today claim.\n\nJefferson wanted the Native-Americas benefit from Jesus\u2019 moral teachings--things we take for granted, like the golden rule (i.e., do unto others as you would have them do unto you, Matthew 7:12) or the command to love one another, as Christ loves us (John 13:33).\n\nThere is no evidence I am aware of that Jefferson ever published \u201cThe Philosophy of Jesus.\u201d There is evidence that around 1819, he created a second version of his private book, this time in English (the King James Version), in French, in Latin, and in Greek (the language of the Gospels). It was only published long after his death.\n\nApparently, he used this compilation of the teachings of Jesus for his own personal edification.\n\nHere are some miracles that remain the so-called \u201cJefferson Bible\u201d:\n\n\u2022Jesus sent His disciples to \u201cheal the sick,\u201d \u201ccleanse the lepers,\u201d \u201craise the dead,\u201d \u201ccast out devils\u201d (Matthew 10:8).\n\n\u2022He healed a man on the Sabbath (Luke 14:1-6);\n\n\u2022He raised Jairus\u2019 daughter from the dead (Matthew 9:18-25);\n\n\u2022He healed the bleeding woman (Matthew 9:20-22);\n\n\u2022Jesus healed two blind men (Matthew 9:27-31).\n\nJefferson\u2019s approach to the Bible, to strip away some of its rich doctrine in Christology or in the beauty of the Godhead, is not commendable or worthy of imitation. But contrary to what some atheists say today, Jefferson was not on a crusade to edit the miracles out of the Bible.", "description": "Once in a while, the myth that Thomas Jefferson edited .09/04/2019 19:39:13PM EST.", "authors": ["Jerry Newcombe", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2014/39/7fd40aa4-2823-414b-93e2-69b5b6a9a2dd.jpg"}
