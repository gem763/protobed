The charmed main character, \u201cthe Swede,\u201d is about to watch his perfect world implode; but the true tragedy, Roth insists (through alter-ego narrator, Nathan Zuckerman), was that he was never equipped to predict it, and that no one ever is \u2014 because the people we build our lives around are essentially unknowable. \u201cYou fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations,\u201d Roth, as Zuckerman, writes, \u201cwithout an overload of bias or hope or arrogance . . . and yet you never fail to get them wrong. . . . You get them wrong before you meet them, while you\u2019re anticipating meeting them; you get them wrong while you\u2019re with them; and then you go home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. . . . And yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of \u2018other people\u2019 . . . so ill-equipped are we all to envision one another\u2019s interior workings and invisible aims?\u201d\n\n[Review: \u2018Fleishman Is in Trouble\u2019 \u2014 and so is modern marriage]\n\nDeflating as it may be, I\u2019m often drawn back to this, mystified. Can you ever really know the people you know so well, or predict the ways their true natures will unfold? What are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people? \u201cFleishman is in Trouble,\u201d this summer\u2019s hit novel (and future TV series) by the celebrated profile writer Taffy Brodesser-Akner, left me flattened, too, for much the same reason. Is divorce, Brodesser-Akner seems to ask, always a function of getting other people wrong; of inevitably missing a million crucial things about them?\n\nOn the surface, the finely observed, inhalable debut novel is about Toby Fleishman, a 41-year-old Manhattan hepatologist and father of tweenagers finally getting his life back after divorcing his maternally resentful, social-climbing talent agent wife Rachel. But just as he\u2019s exploring a brave new world of dating app sexts and wildly available bedfellows, Rachel drops off the kids, heads to a yoga retreat and goes missing for weeks.\n\nThe real story of what happens to Rachel \u2014 and that of Rachel, herself \u2014 is likewise MIA for most of the book, as this is a book about a man, and all the grievances and slights he\u2019s finally empowered to combat. Brodesser-Akner, who\u2019s drawn comparisons to Roth for the novel\u2019s lust and neuroses and super-specific American Jewishness (and who\u2019s professed her die-hard love for the writer), employs her own Zuckermanesque alter ego, Libby Epstein, to narrate the summer of sexual freedom of her old study abroad pal, Toby. Where Nathan is wholly present in the beginning of \u201cPastoral\u201d and then retreats in later chapters to the role of omniscient narrator, Libby does the opposite, first piping up intermittently in service of examining Toby\u2019s life; and then revealing herself to be a singular character who\u2019s really examining her own.\n\n[Now that we\u2019ve all read \u2018Where the Crawdads Sing,\u2019 can we talk about the ending?]\n\nThe novel has drawn raves and sparked thoughtful conversations about where women fit into a male-centric narrative \u2014 and whether that\u2019s only after they\u2019ve managed to wedge themselves in. Libby lost touch with Toby after he got married, but the divorce finds him seeking to reconnect with old friends, spurring out-of-the-blue calls to her and their mutual friend, Seth. Libby\u2019s happy to have been gifted a portal to her freewheeling youth, as adulthood has consistently made her feel sidelined \u2014 first as an under-considered female writer at a men\u2019s magazine, and now as a suburban mom and housewife in New Jersey. (Broddeser-Akner also had an illustrious career at a men\u2019s magazine, GQ; and like Libby, grew up in Brooklyn and went to NYU and studied abroad in Israel and is a mom of two in New Jersey and has never quite kicked her smoking habit; and Roth really did grow up with a guy called \u201cthe Swede,\u201d but I digress.) Her domesticated existence resembles everyone else\u2019s in her neighborhood, making her feel unspecial, unseen; and the middle-aged phase of marriage has left her disillusioned. \u201cAt some point, I didn\u2019t remember when, I had taken all my freedom and independence, and pushed them across the poker table at [my husband] Adam and said, \u2018Here, take my jackpot. Take it all. I don\u2019t need it anymore. I won\u2019t miss it ever.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen Libby re-connects with newly single Toby, she asks him, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you been in touch?\u201d And he responds, seemingly to a different question: \u201cWe would fight in public. It was too embarrassing. She just didn\u2019t care who she started in front of.\u201d Wait, was he even listening? And had he ever been? By the time Libby realizes that Toby\u2019s clear and present needs had always been the throughline of their friendship \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m a real person with a soul and I could use a friend, too,\u201d she says to a dating app-immersed Toby \u2014 it\u2019s too late in their friendship to shake up the dynamic. \u201cWhat possible need could you have?\u201d he asks back.\n\n[You\u2019ve read \u2018Woman in the Window,\u2019 and you\u2019re ready to see the movie. So where is it?]\n\nSo Libby tells her own story. As does Brodesser-Akner: While the author herself is happily married \u2014 even as, she\u2019s joked, saying so indicates the opposite \u2014 she\u2019s revealed that her parents\u2019 divorce left her obsessed with the topic and in need of a way to delve in. Hence, the novel. Other details in the book are ripped straight from Brodesser-Akner\u2019s own life (if you\u2019re a fan, as I am, you\u2019ve seen them pop up in personal essays), helping underscore the way being a woman can feel like the rawest of deals. By the time Karen Cooper, Toby\u2019s patient, is diagnosed with Wilson\u2019s disease, a rare liver affliction, she\u2019d had her symptoms dismissed by an internist as depression, and sent away with a prescription for Zoloft. Brodesser-Akner has written of this very thing happening to her, of being repeatedly told her exhaustion was depression, until her doctor \u201cbegrudgingly\u201d did bloodwork and discovered she had mono. She knows plenty of other women, she\u2019s written, \u201cwho\u2019ve been dismissed by their doctors for being lazy and careless and . . . downright crazy.\u201d For Karen, whose disease could have been easily diagnosed from the early onset symptom of copper-colored rings around her irises, Brodesser-Akner told a book tour crowd in D.C., \u201cI liked the idea \u2014 it\u2019s kind of a hint \u2014 that if anybody had been looking her in the eye, they would have known about this long before it ever happened.\u201d How invisible can a person be?\n\nIn the last act, the novel finally shifts to Rachel\u2019s story. In a twist that\u2019s delighted readers, Libby runs into Rachel \u2014 who appears to have been willfully neglecting her kids, thus validating Toby\u2019s every condemnation of her \u2014 only to discover she\u2019s had a nervous breakdown. By this point, the female characters have learned that being a woman can feel like an affront \u2014 even for Toby and Rachel\u2019s 11-year-old daughter, Hannah, who gets kicked out of camp for texting a racy photo to a boy, who then sent it to everyone he knew. Yet Rachel\u2019s story feels singularly harrowing. Some combination of her brutal childhood and brutal experience of childbirth and her manic efforts to overcome both, finally broke her; and she\u2019s lost weeks of sleep and all sense of time, and is roaming the city sporting sweatpants, eye bags, a chop-job pixie cut she doesn\u2019t remember getting, and a stark swipe of red lipstick, the armor she\u2019s worn since college.\n\n[\u2018Little Fires Everywhere\u2019 is a nostalgia trip for \u201990s kids \u2014 but it\u2019s really all about the moms]\n\nToby\u2019s not a bad guy; and Brodesser-Akner never leads us there. But, she suggests, when you\u2019re stuck, tightfisted, inside your own story \u2014 unable to imagine that how you experience others is really how you experience yourself \u2014 the most unknowable person may be you, after all. \u201cThe fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway,\u201d Roth wrote. \u201cMaybe the best thing would be to forget being right or wrong about people and just go along for the ride. But if you can do that \u2014 well, lucky you.\u201d\n\nRachel Rosenblit is a freelance writer and editor in New York.", "description": "The novel has sparked thoughtful conversations about where women fit into a male-centric narrative.", "authors": ["Rachel Rosenblit", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/E8AyS3KVuMpFCE6lpEoO2Dhl60Y=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WZL5AQXDVMI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
