US officials have also indicated that its resources in the country are being diverted away from operations against Isis and are instead being focused on \u201cforce protection\u201d. In the meantime, the SDF said it had fought off a number of attacks by Isis sleeper cells, and expect to see many more.\n\nSome analysts have suggested that the Turkish incursion could already be helping Isis regroup. Nicholas Heras, a fellow at the Centre for a New American Security think and former outside adviser to the US military, called the Turkish campaign a \u201cboon to Isis\u201d.\n\n\u201cIsis has been under intense pressure from the SDF, which focused on breaking up Isis sleeper cells. Counter-Isis operations require significant amounts of intelligence and focus, which Turkey\u2019s campaign is disrupting,\u201d he told The Independent.\n\nBut the threat of sleeper cells is less of a concern than the possibility of a mass breakout by Isis from the SDF\u2019s makeshift jails. Kurdish officials have repeatedly sounded the alarm about the danger of such an event, and did so again on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis attack will definitely reduce and weaken the guarding system for those Daesh [Isis] militants in the prisons,\u201d said Badran Jia Kurd, an adviser to the SDF-affiliated civil authority in northeast Syria.\n\n\u201cThis could lead to their escape or to behaviours that may get out of the control of the security forces. The number of forces guarding the prisons is reduced the more the battles intensify. This poses a grave danger,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nA general view of the al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria (AFP/Getty) More\n\nThe SDF is currently holding some 12,000 captured Isis fighters, of whom around 1,000 are from European countries. Most were captured in the dying days of the Isis caliphate, the last remnants of which were destroyed by the SDF with US backing.\n\nThe question of what to do with such a large number of hardened fighters has troubled the international community in the months since the defeat of the Isis caliphate. European countries do not want their citizens to return, fearing they would be difficult to convict and might later carry out attacks. The SDF lacks a functioning justice system to try the rest.\n\nEuropean inaction on the issue has angered Donald Trump. In announcing his tacit support for the Turkish offensive into Syria, the US president suggested that Turkey would take custody of the Isis prisoners. But in the chaos of a conflict between the two sides, it is unclear how the transfer of prisoners would work.", "description": "In the days and weeks leading up to Turkey\u2019s military offensive in Syria, the Kurdish militia set to be at the receiving end of the operation issued a stark warning to the international community: If we are attacked, Isis will return.", "authors": ["Richard Hall", "Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jrfCzJZqvXD9BP7RtHpXCA--~B/aD0zNTA7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/f31506ef2aac40b3a42270193e83121a", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
