Yovanovitch from Kiev as an egregious abuse of the system by allies of Mr. Trump who were seeking to push aside a perceived obstacle, according to a person familiar with Ms. Hill\u2019s account. Ms. Yovanovitch told the investigators in closed-door testimony last week that the president had personally pushed for her ouster for months, based on \u201cfalse claims.\u201d\n\nThe removal of Ms. Yovanovitch has emerged as a key episode in the narrative under examination by the House as part of its impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump. A career diplomat, Ms. Yovanovitch was targeted by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, and other allies who were seeking to press Ukraine to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic rivals.\n\nMs. Hill\u2019s interview kicked off what promises to be another active week of investigation by the House, where Democrats opened a formal impeachment inquiry late last month based on an intelligence officer\u2019s whistle-blower complaint that alleged that Mr. Trump had abused his power to try to enlist Ukraine to interfere on his behalf in the 2020 election.", "description": "Fiona Hill, a former top adviser on the National Security Council, was prepared to tell House investigators that she objected to the removal of the ambassador to Ukraine.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/us/politics/14dc-impeach-sub/14dc-impeach-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
