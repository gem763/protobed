Armstrong Roberts/Retrofile/Getty Images\n\nWhether you\u2019ve attended 1, 2, 5, or 15 weddings this summer, you\u2019ve probably gifted a few sets of registry wine glasses or plates, or maybe contributed to that honeymoon excursion to Sorrento. But what about engagement gifts? A relatively new tradition \u2014 etiquette expert Elaine Swann estimates that they\u2019ve only become a thing in the past ten years \u2014 engagement gifts are typically smaller than wedding gifts, and given to those with whom you have a close relationship. \u201cAn engagement gift is something thoughtful, however typically not as significant as a wedding gift in size or cost,\u201d says Myka Meier, founder of Beaumont Etiquette and an etiquette instructor the Plaza Hotel Finishing Program.\n\n\u201cEngagement gifts are not required or expected,\u201d says etiquette expert Patricia Napier-Fitzpatrick, founder and president of The Etiquette School of New York. \u201cBut they\u2019re very common practice. I mean, who wants to go empty-handed to any kind of party celebrating someone?\u201d If you do want to give an engagement gift, the resounding advice from the etiquette experts we spoke to was that you should choose something that both people in the couple can enjoy. \u201cA gift could be anything thoughtful to commemorate the occasion, from a keepsake frame with the date on it to a gorgeous floral arrangement if they already live together,\u201d says Meier. If it\u2019s a couple that you don\u2019t know very well and still want to congratulate, the experts agreed that a card would be a sweet and inexpensive gesture. And of course, there\u2019s the old standby: \u201cWhen in doubt, nothing says celebration like a nice bottle of Champagne,\u201d says Meier. Here are some Strategist-approved engagement gifts, inspired by the etiquette experts\u2019 recommendations.\n\nFrames\n\nFramebridge The Stella Frame \u201cA lot of times we post pictures, but we don\u2019t print them anymore, so a really great gift idea is a printed photo in a beautiful frame that they can place inside their home,\u201d says etiquette expert Elaine Swann. \u201cIf you can download a photo from their social media site that has a pretty good resolution, you can give them a photo of the two of them together.\u201d Several of the other etiquette experts we spoke to seconded Swann\u2019s recommendation to gift a frame. Meier suggests \u201ca keepsake frame with the date on it,\u201d and we think this sleek frame from Framebridge, which has a customizable matte, is an attractive option. $85 at Framebridge Buy\n\nAnd if the couple is not the keepsake-with-date type, these frames make handsome alternatives \u2014 and like all of Framebridge\u2019s custom-frame offerings, you can send in a file from Instagram or Facebook, making it particularly easy to get that post from your friend\u2019s feed to the framer.\n\nMicca NEO 10-Inch Digital Photo Frame With 8 GB Storage For those who would prefer something on the techier side, you could give a digital picture frame, like this one, which is under $100 and lets you add photos from a USB. $90 at Amazon Buy $90 at Amazon Buy\n\nPhoto: Retailer Mixbook Custom Photo Album \u201cI think a photo album is a great gift for people getting married,\u201d says Napier-Fitzpatrick. \u201cThey could have one just for the engagement party, and one just for their wedding.\u201d We\u2019ve written about Mixbook\u2019s custom albums before, which you can put together by uploading pictures from your phone. And if you don\u2019t have enough pictures to put together an album, you can always send the couple a gift card so they can build their own. $45 at Mixbook Buy\n\nThrows\n\nEider & Ivory Brampt Herringbone Throw Swann suggests gifting a \u201cvery beautiful\u201d throw blanket that would be \u201csomething that they both can cuddle up in.\u201d When we talked to designers about the best blankets to give as gifts, herringbone throws were what they suggested as a \u201ctimeless gift\u201d that would appeal to recipients with all kinds of taste \u2014 and we think this one would make a classy engagement gift. $105 at Wayfair Buy\n\nThree Posts Hardwick Chunky Knitted Acrylic Throw $69 (was $99, now 30% off) If a chunkier knit is more the couple\u2019s style, this one comes in a bunch of neutrals that would go with most interiors. $69 at Wayfair Buy\n\nWicked Plush Throw Several of the experts we spoke to suggested giving customized gifts, with the couple\u2019s names monogrammed on them. This \u201cWicked Plush Throw\u201d from L.L.Bean is a bit more casual and definitely cozy, and can be monogrammed if you think the couple would be into some customized coziness. $30 at L.L.Bean Buy\n\nPendleton Washable Wool Blanket A classic plaid Pendleton blanket would make a nice gift for that couple who loves having a \u201crustic\u201d weekend in Hudson every fall. (This one can also be customized.) $440 at Macy's Buy\n\nVases\n\nNow House by Jonathan Adler Tall Cloud Vase, Pink \u201cA vase is always a nice gift,\u201d says Napier-Fitzpatrick, who suggested crystal as a \u201cgeneric\u201d option. If you want to give something a little more punchy, we\u2019re fans of these Jonathan Adler vases, which come in several pleasing shades of blue, green, and cream. From $28 at Amazon Buy From $28 at Amazon Buy\n\nBloomingville Tall White Ceramic Fluted Vase Another ceramic option, which we think looks like it costs a lot more than $31. $31 at Amazon Buy $31 at Amazon Buy\n\nCYS Cylindrical Vase A minimalist glass option that would fit in with just about any home d\u00e9cor style. $36 at Amazon Buy $36 at Amazon Buy\n\nIce buckets\n\nPottery Barn Harrison Ice Bucket with Tongs \u201cMy husband\u2019s nephew got married, and for the engagement party I gave them an ice bucket \u2014 not sterling silver, but a nice one, from the Pottery Barn \u2014 and a bottle of ros\u00e9,\u201d says Napier-Fitzpatrick. This Pottery Barn bucket seems like it would appeal to lots of different tastes, and has that sleek sterling-silver look without the high price tag. $79 at Pottery Barn Buy\n\nOld Dutch Hammered Ice Bucket with Liner and Tongs This ice bucket was named as an ideal holiday gift by Allen Katz, cofounder of New York Distilling Company, and we think it would also make a great addition to the apartment of a couple with a vintage-y aesthetic. $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nTop Shelf Personalized Stainless Steel Double Wall Ice Bucket with Tongs Meier suggests giving \u201can ice bucket with the family initials of the soon-to-be-married couple\u201d as a gift, and better yet, to include a bottle of wine. She says that if you\u2019re unsure if both people will take the same last name, it\u2019s a good idea to have their two first names engraved on the bucket. $69 at Bed Bath & Beyond Buy\n\nPlants and flowers\n\nThe Bouqs Company Bora Bora Orchid \u201cI always tell people not to take fresh flowers to a party because someone has to put them in water,\u201d Napier-Fitzpatrick says, and suggests bringing a plant, like an orchid, instead. Etiquette expert Jacqueline Whitmore seconded this recommendation, telling us that she brought an orchid to the last engagement party she attended. $69 at The Bouqs Company Buy\n\nCosta Farms Chinese Money Plant and Plant Stand This plant is known for sprouting \u201cbaby plants,\u201d which can be potted and shared \u2014 so if you\u2019re lucky, you might get your own plant out of this gift, too. $55 at Amazon Buy $55 at Amazon Buy\n\nCosta Farms Golden Pothos An easy-to-care-for plant that will live even if your friends forget to water it before they leave for their honeymoon. $33 at Amazon Buy $33 at Amazon Buy\n\nCoffee-table books\n\nOnly Human: Photographs by Martin Parr $44 (was $60, now 27% off) Swann suggests a coffee-table book inspired by the couple\u2019s shared interests as a thoughtful engagement gift. \u201cMaybe a photo book \u2014 you could do a little bit of sleuthing around and see if there\u2019s somewhere or something that they\u2019ve enjoyed,\u201d she says. This Martin Parr book would make a perfect gift for the couple who love people-watching. $44 at Amazon Buy $44 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Central Park: Original Designs for New York\u2019s Greatest Treasure $32 (was $50, now 36% off) And for the couple who frequent the New York Historical Society and spend Sundays in the park, a book about the creation of Central Park. $32 at Amazon Buy $32 at Amazon Buy\n\nShtetl in the Sun: Andy Sweet\u2019s South Beach 1977\u20131980 $37 (was $40, now 8% off) A book for the couple who aspire to retiring to South Beach. $37 at Amazon Buy $37 at Amazon Buy\n\nAn Atlas of Rare & Familiar Colour: The Harvard Art Museums\u2019 Forbes Pigment Collection $29 (was $38, now 24% off) For the artist couple who want to brush up on color theory. $29 at Amazon Buy $29 at Amazon Buy\n\nHerman Miller: A Way of Living $70 (was $90, now 22% off) And one for the couple who eagerly await the arrival of the MoMA Design Store catalog. $70 at Amazon Buy $70 at Amazon Buy\n\nCards\n\nCrane & Co. Congratulatory Greeting Card \u201cWe forget about cards, but people cherish cards,\u201d says Swann. \u201cThey cherish that you\u2019ve taken the time to go out and purchase something and then write great wishes for them in the card.\u201d These cards from Crane have a classic look to them and would be ideal for jotting down some well wishes. $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nPartay Shenanigans 50 Pack Congratulations Card And a multipack of \u201ccongratulations\u201d cards that will cover you through peak engagement season and possibly through next wedding season, too. $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
