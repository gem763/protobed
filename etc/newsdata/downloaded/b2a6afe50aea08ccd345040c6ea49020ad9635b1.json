What\u2019s more, the vast majority of the increase in self-employment in Canada has been in the form of unincorporated, one-person operations, which on average, earn 75% of the income earned by paid-employees.\u201d\n\nDemographics also play a role. Tal says population growth in Canada has been higher than the U.S. since 1980, accounting for 15 per cent of the widening of the gap.\n\n\u201cWith that extra population growth, we should have seen proportionally extra income growth, and that obviously is not happening,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTal also chalks up a big part of the gap to taxes, which account for 30 per cent of gross income in Canada compared to 10 per cent in the U.S. The discrepancy is mostly explained by the higher level of government-provided services in Canada.\n\n\u201cGrowth in gross income in the U.S. rose roughly at the same rate as net income. At the same time in Canada, net income rose more slowly,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that the impact of faster-rising taxes and other transfers to governments [such as CPP] in Canada have accounted for close to one-quarter.\u201d\n\nCanada also trails the U.S. when it comes to income in the form of interest, dividends, and rent.\n\nTal says if it weren\u2019t for Canada\u2019s overall underperformance, the household debt-to-income ratio would be closer to 150 per cent instead of the 170 per cent it is today.\n\nJessy Bains is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance Canada.
