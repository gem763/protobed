Democrats say no vote is necessary. Douglas Letter, a lawyer for the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee, contended Tuesday that a formal impeachment inquiry was underway for the simple fact that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says it is.\n\n\u201cWe have said it in our briefs and I am saying it to you now,\u201d Letter said. \u201cThe House under the Constitution sets its own rules and the House has sole power over impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has argued that judicial proceedings take place not in Congress but in court before a judge or magistrate. A Trump administration lawyer argued Tuesday that Democrats have had a \u201cshifting rationale\u201d in arguing why they need the documents, especially because the government had already turned over material from the investigation.\n\n\u201cWe feel that there has been really no showing of particularized need,\u201d said Justice Department lawyer Elizabeth Shapiro.\n\nLetter said the materials are needed for the impeachment inquiry to further investigate what Trump knew or said about Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election. He said the information already disclosed by the Justice Department, including limited summaries of FBI witness interviews, is woefully insufficient. He noted that the interview summary of one of the most crucial witnesses, former White House counsel Don McGahn, had not yet been disclosed.\n\n\u201cThis is not a situation of us getting all sorts of materials,\u201d Letter said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting almost nothing.\u201d\n\nIt was not clear when Howell might rule, though she repeatedly appeared skeptical of the Justice Department\u2019s reasoning for not disclosing the material. She said she was concerned that withholding the documents, coupled with the Justice Department\u2019s adherence to its policy that sitting presidents cannot be indicted, could result in the public never knowing what investigators found.\n\nThe judge ordered Shapiro to disclose by Friday whether the Mueller team disclosed grand jury information when it requested assistance from foreign countries during its investigation, and if so, how often that occurred. She said she was trying to establish whether the Justice Department was refusing to give Congress information it had already disclosed to other nations.\n\n____\n\nFollow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Lawyers for House Democrats urged a judge Tuesday to release secret grand jury testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation as Congress conducts an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eric Tucker"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/07/29/Trump_Russia_Probe_34470.jpg-5c319_c0-0-5472-3190_s1770x1032.jpg?84283544d3cc688d49296344fdb2455c1a0f271f", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
