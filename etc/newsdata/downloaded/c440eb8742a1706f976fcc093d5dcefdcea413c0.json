Sign up here.\n\nThe Trump administration slapped tariffs on roughly $110 billion in Chinese imports on Sunday, marking the latest escalation in a trade war that\u2019s inflicting damage across the world economy. China retaliated.\n\nThe 15% U.S. duty hit consumer goods ranging from footwear and apparel to home textiles and certain technology products like the Apple Watch. A separate batch of about $160 billion in Chinese goods -- including laptops and cellphones -- will be hit with 15% tariffs on Dec. 15. President Donald Trump delayed part of the levies to blunt the impact on holiday shopping.\n\nInvestors sought the safety of the yen, which edged higher against the dollar as currency markets opened for trading. The offshore yuan pared some losses to trade at 7.1682 per dollar Monday at 10:38 a.m. in Beijing after the PBOC set the fixing rate stronger than all estimates.\n\nAsian stocks fell with U.S. equity futures after the tariffs kicked in, even though the measures had been widely anticipated. S&P 500 futures opened 1% lower before paring losses, and Treasury contracts advanced.\n\nThe new tariffs imposed over the weekend is \u201ca turning point in the trade war\u201d with the U.S., an editorial in the Communist Party\u2019s tabloid Global Times wrote Sunday evening. The report said the tariffs on daily goods are to hit U.S. consumers directly, and it also showed Washington is almost at the end of its wits.\n\n\u201cThe US economy cannot sustain its superficial prosperity and is facing a bigger risk of decline,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cThe Trump administration has shot Americans in the foot. When more and more Americans feel the pain, maybe it will be time for Washington to recover rationality.\u201d\n\nWhile the Trump administration has dismissed concern about a protracted trade war, business groups are calling for a tariff truce and the resumption of negotiations between the world\u2019s two-largest economies.\n\nFace-to-face talks between Chinese and American trade negotiators scheduled for Washington in September are still on, Trump told reporters Sunday after returning from Camp David.\n\n\u201cWe are talking to China, the meeting is still on,\u201d Trump said. The president repeated the assertion that China, not the U.S., is \u201cpaying\u201d for the tariffs, and said that farmers hurt by Beijing\u2019s retaliation on U.S. agricultural goods are being made \u201cmore than whole\u201d by federal payments.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t allow China to rip us off anymore,\u201d Trump added.\n\nChina has repeatedly decried U.S pressure tactics, with signs that its officials are girding for a prolonged confrontation.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s determination to fight against the U.S. economic warmongering has only grown stronger, and its countermeasures more resolute, measured and targeted,\u201d according to a commentary by the official Xinhua News Agency after the tariffs kicked in. One thing that \u201cWhite House tariff men should learn is that the Chinese economy is strong and resilient enough to resist the pressure brought about in the ongoing trade war.\u201d\n\nCollateral Damage\n\nWhile Trump has repeatedly said China is paying for his tariffs, many companies and economists say that U.S. importers bear the cost -- and some of it is passed on to consumers.\n\nThe non-partisan Congressional Budget Office in August projected that by 2020, Trump\u2019s tariffs and trade war will reduce the level of real U.S. GDP by about 0.3% and reduce average real household income by $580.\n\nThat followed a JPMorgan Chase & Co. note to clients estimating that the latest round of tariffs will increase the average cost per U.S. household to $1,000 a year -- up from $600 for duties enacted last year. That estimate is in the low range because it was based on a duty rate of 10%, before Trump increased it to 15%.\n\nAbout 90% of California-based JLab Audio\u2019s headphones and other wireless products targeted for duties got hit Sunday, possibly hurting holiday sales and forcing a delay in hiring, CEO Win Cramer said. About 40% of the company\u2019s sales come in the fourth quarter, he said.\n\n\u201cIf I had hair, I\u2019d be pulling it out,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cI\u2019m really concerned about the financial performance of the business, knowing that if we continue to eat this cost, how much it hurts.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0The Trump administration slapped tariffs on roughly $110 billion in Chinese imports on Sunday, marking the latest escalation in a trade war that\u2019s inflicting damage across the world economy", "authors": ["Jenny Leonard", "Mark Niquette"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/slbt2c4mCAE6MpO4FWOMmw--~B/aD05NTI7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/4b721e4753788a4e5c0311c4e2c6b07e"}
