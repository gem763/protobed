On the table there is a mass of ethernet cables, many of which appear not to be plugged into anything.\n\nThe image is in stark contrast to the 2011 photograph, in which Mr Obama is not the focus of the overall image, and in which the national security team, dressed in less formal attire, appear tense and are focused on witnessing what is unfolding on an unseen screen out of shot.\n\nMembers of Barack Obama\u2019s national security team in the Situation Room during the operation that killed Osama bin Laden (White House) More\n\nThe differences have led many critics to accuse Mr Trump of staging the photograph, rather than it being a true depiction of what the situation room looked like at the time of the raid.\n\nBut is it really staged?\n\nIn a tweet, which has since been favourited over 50,000 times and retweeted almost 20,000 times in less than 24 hours, former White House photographer Mr Souza wrote: \u201cThe raid, as reported, took place at 3:30PM Washington time. The photo, as shown in the camera IPTC data, was taken at \u201c17:05:24\u201d.\u201d", "description": "In 2011, 10 years after the terrorist attacks in New York which destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Centre, the architect of the hijackings, Osama bin Laden, was killed by US special forces in a raid in Pakistan.The US Navy Seals carrying out the raid relayed live footage to the White House,", "authors": ["Harry Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/G1eYM_9DdYjW7X7HNb356A--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/28b72b3e9ceea67972e4bc588b253c90", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
