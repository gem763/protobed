Your Queen?\u2019\n\nAfter responding \u2018no\u2019, they kiss. The script, in a deviation from the aired episode, then says, \u2018[Dany] is desperate for a connection; she cannot remember a time she has felt this alone. She pulls back from the kiss and looks at Jon. This is complicated for him. He loves her. He disapproves strongly of what she\u2019s doing. He lusts after her. He fears her. She feels his ambivalence\u2019.\n\nDaenerys then replies: \u2018It disgusts you.\u2019\n\nAs Jon trails off, her expression \u2018hardens\u2019 before she says the line: \u2018All right then, let it be fear.\u2019\n\nIn the episode, Jon doesn\u2019t respond when Daenerys asks about being more than a queen \u2013 with the pair sharing a kiss, only for him to pull back and hurt Daenerys\u2019 feelings, who utters \u2018let it be fear\u2019.\n\nThe feast at Winterfell also plays out slightly differently in the script (Picture: HBO)\n\nWhile it\u2019s only a small detail which was cut, it could have gone a long way in driving home Daenerys\u2019 frustrations which resulted in her burning down King\u2019s Landing \u2013 something many fans believe was rushed in the aired episodes.\n\nInterestingly, another scene was trimmed which also would have helped emphasize Daenerys\u2019 loneliness, which saw Missandei and Grey Worm attend the feast of Winterfell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Daenerys notices the flirting between them, she compares it to the affection she receives from Jon, who is distracted and wrapped up in his own thoughts.\n\nGrey Worm is dismissed from the table when Missandei makes up a lie to be excused, with a key note in the script, noting: \u2018Dany is happy for her friend. But she\u2019s also aware that everyone seems to be having fun except for her.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s lonely and Varys clocks her loneliness.\u2019\n\nWhile some of these are stage notes, these small cut moments may have gone some way to conveying the transformation of Daenerys in a more effective way.\n\nEmilia Clarke has recently expressed how she feels \u2018heartbreak\u2019 at the fan backlash to season eight, on behalf of showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss.\n\nGame Of Thrones is available on Sky Atlantic and NOW TV.\n\nMORE: Amazon\u2019s Lord Of The Rings TV series casts Game Of Thrones star Joseph Mawle as villain\n\nMORE: Drogon presents a glaring plot hole with Daenerys\u2019 death in Game of Thrones", "description": "The scripts for the final season have been made available to the public.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SEI_51020860_1571744961.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
