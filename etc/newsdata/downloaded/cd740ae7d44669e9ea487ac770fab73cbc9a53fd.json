In the United States, juries have awarded huge monetary damages to people who say their cancer was caused by exposure to glyphosate. Bayer, which owns Monsanto, says the herbicide is safe when used properly, as does the US Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nNeumann Kaffee Gruppe (NKG), one of the world's largest traders, said glyphosate was one of a number of substances it monitored on the coffee it buys. Nestle buys some of its coffee beans from NKG. It was too early to say what consequences Nestle's tighter controls would have on NKG, a spokesperson said.\n\nNestle's NSRGF decision to increase the frequency of checks was unlikely to disrupt global coffee supply chains, a spokesperson said. \"This is not a new process, we are just reinforcing controls,\" the spokesperson told CNN Business.
