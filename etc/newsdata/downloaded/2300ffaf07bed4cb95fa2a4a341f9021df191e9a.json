Strong doll sales boost Mattel earnings", "language": "en", "text": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Leave it to Barbie. Strong sales of the popular dolls offset declines in infant and pre-school toys, helping Mattel report better-than-expected quarterly earnings Tuesday.\n\nBut even as its share price got a boost on the good news, the toymaker said it would restate some 2017 financial results after an internal investigation partially confirmed a whistleblower complaint but found no fraud by management.\n\nFollowing the probe, Mattel announced that Joseph Euteneuer would step down as chief financial officer and the company was conducting a search for a replacement.\n\nBesides the Barbies marching off the shelves, strong sales of \u201cHot Wheels\u201d cars, and action figures and games, boosted by popular \u201cToy Story 4\u201d products, fueled a more than tenfold increase in net income in the third quarter, which surged to $70.6 million from just $6.3 million in the year-ago period.\n\nExecutives also said a turnaround plan was on track after losses in 2017 and 2018, caused by a hit from the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bankruptcy and the loss of the key \u201cPrincess\u201d line of dolls to rival Hasbro.\n\n\u201cOur third quarter performance demonstrates the continued momentum of our multi-year turnaround and consistent progress in transforming Mattel into an IP-driven, high-performing toy company,\u201d CEO Ynon Kreiz said.\n\nMattel said an investigation by its audit board concluded that the company understated income tax expenses by $109 million in the third quarter of 2017, but overstated it by the same amount in the subsequent quarter, resulting in no impact to full-year results.\n\n\u201cThe investigation did not find that management engaged in fraud,\u201d Mattel said, but revealed \u201ccertain material weaknesses\u201d in internal controls.\n\nThe problem was due to \u201ca confluence of one-time events\u201d and that \u201clapses in judgment by management contributed to these failures.\u201d\n\nThe investigation did not find problems with Mattel\u2019s outside auditor, another question raised by the whistleblower.\n\nMattel said it would restate the 2017 results and its outside auditor replaced its lead partner and other members of its audit team.\n\nThe toymaker listed executive changes as part of its response to the investigation, including the departure of Euteneuer, who will exit after a transition period of up to six months.\n\nShares of Mattel surged 20 percent to $12.67 in after-hours trading.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Leave it to Barbie.
