When a Georgetown resident noticed it Sunday on her home security camera, she worried it might be a mountain lion in her yard.\n\nBut wildlife experts said the video, which became popular on social media, depicts nothing more than a domestic cat.\n\nTommy Wells, director of the District\u2019s Department of Energy and Environment, said Monday that city wildlife biologists looked at the video and determined it\u2019s not a mountain lion.\n\nMountain lions, Wells said, don\u2019t have stripes on their tails, and the proportions of the animal seen on video are \u201cmagnified by the camera.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident it\u2019s a common domestic cat,\u201d he said. \u201cThe camera appears to have distorted the size of a domestic cat.\u201d\n\nThe video took off on social media after Giulia di Marzo, a District lawyer, posted it to a Georgetown neighborhood blog, saying her security camera captured the animal about 4 a.m. Sunday. She wrote, \u201cdoes not look like a domestic cat \u2026 looks a lot like a mountain lion.\u201d\n\n[D.C. mountain lion alert generates jokes, but no sign of a giant cat]\n\nLiving near Rock Creek Park, she said she\u2019s used to seeing deer and the occasional red fox, but hadn\u2019t seen such a large catlike animal. She said she and some neighbors \u2014 one of whom has an eight-pound dog \u2014 became worried about their pets. Di Marzo has a 13-pound cat named Socrates that sometimes goes outside.\n\nDi Marzo said she showed the video to her parents, who live in Bethesda, Md., and have a 30-pound Maine coon cat. \u201cThis was not that,\u201d she said. They, too, thought it might be a mountain lion.\n\nShe posted on the neighborhood blog that if the large cat belonged to someone in the neighborhood, she hoped to \u201crule out that it\u2019s something more dangerous.\u201d Di Marzo said she noticed scratch marks on her fence from the animal.\n\nOn Monday, Chris Schindler, vice president of field services at the Humane Rescue Alliance in the District, said animal control officers patrolled the area after receiving reports stemming from the video but \u201cfound no signs of a big cat.\u201d In an email, he also said \u201cno other residents reported seeing a mountain lion or similar size animal in the area.\u201d He went on to say that \u201cwe have not had any confirmed sightings of mountain lions in the District.\u201d\n\nA National Zoo spokeswoman said the animal doesn\u2019t belong at that facility and that the zoo doesn\u2019t have mountain lions.\n\nSo rest easy, Washingtonians.\n\nDi Marzo said Monday afternoon she was \u201crelieved and happy\u201d to learn it was just a cat. She said she still hadn\u2019t heard from anyone who claimed to own the animal.\n\n\u201cWe asked if anyone owned a cat that looked like this. That was our main concern,\u201d she said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to cause fear or an uproar.\u201d\n\nWildlife biologists said the eastern cougar was declared extinct in 2011 and taken off the endangered species list in 2018. The closest mountain lion to the nation\u2019s capital might be a Florida panther, officials said.\n\nIt isn\u2019t the first time someone in the D.C. region thought a mountain lion was spotted. In 2013, a woman in Southeast Washington thought she saw one, but animal control experts found no signs. They speculated she might have seen a coyote or a deer.\n\n[What questions do you have about D.C. or the region?
