He flushed home two more dunks, the first off of beautiful ball movement in transition.\n\nLater, he showed off his acrobatics, going up and around a defender for a scoop layup.\n\nThe NBA world is already giddy for Williamson.\n\nThe Pelicans have shied away from hyping up Williamson too much. Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations David Griffin has called Jrue Holiday the leader of the team, so as not to put too much pressure on Williamson. Head coach Alvin Gentry said Williamson should not be compared to highly touted prospects of the past, like LeBron James.\n\n\"They shouldn't do that [comparing],\" Gentry said (via ESPN's Malika Andrews). \"We are not doing that. We are comparing Zion to Zion. We want Zion to be the best Zion Williamson that he can be. Not anybody else. We want him to be the best basketball player he can become using his name and no comparison.\"\n\nHe added: \"I know that it's inevitable that that's going to be the case, but we are not drinking that Kool-Aid.\"\n\nHowever, with Williamson already wowing crowds and drawing huge cheers in his first preseason game, it's likely that the hype will follow the No. 1 pick.", "description": "Zion Williamson lived up to the hype in his first game, putting on a show with three electric dunks, plus more.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9cab82754caa4ca9535ff5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
