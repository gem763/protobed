Getty\n\n\"Nobody wants to put the public to this inconvenience, particularly ... at this season,\" Mr Johnson said. \"[But] across the country there is a widespread view that this parliament has run its course\".\n\nMr Johnson's new plan to work with the pro-Remain minor parties needs only a one-line bill, which Mr Johnson is expected to introduce on Tuesday (Wednesday AEDT).\n\nThere's still some uncertainty: the Liberal Democrats want to maximise their concentrated vote in pro-Remain university towns by holding the poll early in the week of December 9, before students disperse home for Christmas.\n\nThis is shaping up as a deal-breaker for them, but Mr Johnson has thus far stuck firmly to his call that the election should be on Thursday December 12.\n\nAlso, the SNP might try to introduce an amendment lowering the voting age to 16, which Mr Johnson won't accept - and which would also complicate the authorities' ability to get the election organised this side of Christmas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEU agrees Brexit delay\n\nStill, the minor parties' announcement of their move prompted the European Union to on Monday agree to a three-month Brexit 'flextension', postponing the date on which Britain's membership lapses from October 31 to January 31.\n\nThe deferral is flexible because it could be shortened if a Brexit deal was settled earlier, the EU said. But there would be no further negotiations on the deal between Brussels and London.\n\nMr Johnson accepted the delay, writing a letter to the European Union later the same day (Tuesday AEDT) in which he urged the bloc's leaders to \"make clear that a further extension after January 31 is not possible\".\n\nLabour remains concerned that the EU's new extension leaves open the possibility of Mr Johnson abandoning his deal and resuming his thwarted push towards a no-deal Brexit, as the path of least resistance.\n\nMr Johnson may yet have to promise the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, both fiercely 'Remain' parties, that he won't pursue a no-deal Brexit.\n\nLabour isn't buying that. \"This is a prime minister who cannot be trusted,\" Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn told parliament ahead of the vote on Monday (Tuesday AEDT). \"Every promise this prime minister makes, he abandons.\"\n\nThe minor parties are probably supporting an election for politically expedient reasons - to capitalise on Labour's disarray over Brexit and thus poach seats - but are arguing publicly that even though there's a risk of a no-deal Brexit, an election is the only way out of the prolonged Brexit impasse.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats' willingness to back an election signals they may have abandoned as unrealistic the aspiration for a second Brexit referendum, which doesn't command majority support in parliament.\n\nThe campaign for a so-called 'People's Vote' later that same day lapsed into disarray, as senior figures tried to remove some of the organisation's key operatives in a dispute over tactics.\n\nThis only added to a sense that Mr Johnson, despite breaking his cornerstone 'do or die' promise to quit the EU on Halloween, will start the election campaign with the upper hand.", "description": "But the chances grow that the British PM will get his Christmas wish - a snap December election - after the smaller anti-Brexit parties play Santa.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.227%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2947349120fedd15bf6f1370dac7ae5ba5212236", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
