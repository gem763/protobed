However, BTC is still facing a lot of hurdles on the upside near $8,400 and $8,500.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nYesterday, BTC traded to a new weekly low near $7,770 against the US Dollar. Later, the price started an upside correction above the $7,850 and $7,920 resistance levels. Moreover, there was a break above the $8,000 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. During the rise, there was a break above yesterday\u2019s highlighted declining channel with resistance near the $8,060 level on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\n\nThe pair even climbed above the $8,200 resistance and tested the $8,350 level. A swing high was formed near $8,348 and the price is currently correcting gains. It is trading towards the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent rebound from the $7,770 low to $8,348 high. It seems like there is a rising channel forming with support near the $8,200 level on the same chart.\n\nIf there is a downside break below the channel support, the price could correct lower towards the $8,150 level. The main support on the downside is near the $8,050 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent rebound from the $7,770 low to $8,348 high is close to the $8,060 level to provide support.\n\nTherefore, dips towards the $8,050 level might find support in the near term. Any further declines could push the price towards $8,000 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent rebound from the $7,770 low to $8,348 high. On the upside, there are many hurdles near $8,350, $8,400 and $8,500. A successful close above the $8,500 resistance is must for the price to move into a positive zone.\n\nLooking at the chart, bitcoin is rebounding from the $7,770 swing low. However, the price is still trading well below the main $8,500 resistance area. In the short term, there could be another dip towards $8,150 or $8,050 before the price climbs above $8,350.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is slowly moving into the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is now correcting lower towards the 60 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $8,150 followed by $8,050.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $8,350, $8,400 and $8,500.", "description": "Bitcoin price is currently rebounding above $8,200 against the US Dollar.
