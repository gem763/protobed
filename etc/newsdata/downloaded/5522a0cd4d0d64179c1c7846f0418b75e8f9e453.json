The incident happened at an unregulated roundabout populated with civilian cars. Only by luck, no one was hurt.\n\nPhotos and videos from the site on the outskirts of Magas in Republic of Ingushetia in Russia\u2019s North Caucasus showed the self-propelled gun sitting upside down in the middle of the road, with a deformed muzzle.\n\nThe Pion suffered damage, which \u201cmade repair and further use of the self-propelled gun for its intended purpose impossible,\u201d because it wasn\u2019t properly attached to the truck, investigators said.\n\nThe driver fixed the hardware to the front part of the semitrailer with a metal chain, but failed to do the same for the rear part as stipulated in transportation rules. As a result, the metal chain at the front couldn\u2019t take the strain and was torn apart.\n\nhttps://t.co/Ql1pircuWQ\n\n\u0412 \u0418\u043d\u0433\u0443\u0448\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0421\u0410\u0423 2\u04217 \"\u041f\u0438\u043e\u043d\"... pic.twitter.com/NBGEI4PqQw \u2014 \u0424\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043c \u041c\u041c\u0413 (@forumMMG) March 15, 2019\n\nThe Defense Ministry said that Proskurin\u2019s carelessness cost it 24.4 million rubles (around $380,000) and filed a civil lawsuit against the soldier.\n\nThe driver acknowledged his guilt, but asked the garrison court to dismiss the ministry\u2019s lawsuit against him without prejudice.\n\nBut the judge ruled otherwise. On Thursday, he found Proskurin guilty of damaging military hardware due to negligence and ordered him to repay the full price of the Pion.

The system can fire 203mm shells at a distance of up to 47.5km (29.5 miles), and is capable of using nuclear ammunition.\n\nEarlier this year, another contract soldier, who drove a self-propelled Pantsir-S missile system without a proper license and caused it to overturn, escaped with a fine equal to his monthly salary. The damage was estimated to have been 17 million rubles (about $263,000).\n\nLike this story?
