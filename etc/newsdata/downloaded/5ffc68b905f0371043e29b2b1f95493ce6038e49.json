It's very surreal. When Mark and Travis asked me to play with them I was immediately thrilled and excited but also waiting for the joke.\n\n\"I thought someone was playing a joke on me. It's been that way. Avery beautiful joke. It hasn\u2019t been a joke at all. It's amazing.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nMark, who lived in London for three years and supported Chelsea, declared his love for the country.\n\nHe said: \"When we first stared coming over here, London specifically took in our trio before the rest of the world.\n\n\"This is very much a second home for me. I\u2019ve been in love with this country for a couple of decades now and love coming here.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nGood Morning Britain viewers took to Twitter after seeing the changed line-up.\n\nOne viewer said: \"What! Blink 182 on #GMB ! Would it be polite to say they\u2019ve certainly aged! why are they still trying to look 22\n\nAnother asked: \"Is that really the lead singer?\"\n\nA third said: \"He's not Tom the lead singer.... Stand in klaxon \"\n\n*Good Morning Britain airs weekdays on ITV at 6am", "description": "Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba addressed the confusion over their name - and GMB viewer spotted a change in their line-up", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20646182.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RLP_MDG_18766JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
