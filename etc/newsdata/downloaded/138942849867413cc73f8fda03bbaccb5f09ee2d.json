Inside were some of the ashes of Brian Mullins, a tow truck driver from Garland, Texas, who died earlier this year at age 39.\n\nSgt. Paula Pendleton of the Walton County Sheriff's Office said she cried while reading the notes, which included the phone number of the deceased man's family. His mother had placed four $1 bills in the bottle to help pay for the phone calls she hoped people would make to update her family on the bottle's journey.\n\n\"This bottle contains the ashes of my son, Brian, who suddenly and unexpectedly passed on March 9, 2019,\" one of the handwritten notes said. \"I'm sending him on one last adventure.\"\n\nA second note, written on wrinkled school paper, especially moved Sgt. Pendleton, whose husband died last year.\n\n\"When my father passed, I was 14-years-old,\" the message read. \"It has struck our whole family pretty hard and, so far, it has been a very hard road.
