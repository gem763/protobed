She said she rejected him.\n\n\n\nHer allegations (along with those of other notables who publicly spoke to the Times, such as Angelina Jolie) revealed a repeated pattern of sexual abuse at the hands of one of Hollywood's biggest producers, although Weinstein has denied the accusations.\n\nDuring the interview, Guthrie noted that She Said authors Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey credited Paltrow for being a major asset to their investigation. \"They said, 'Gwyneth Paltrow, behind the scenes, helped us move this piece when we were really stuck,'\" Guthrie told the actress.\n\nPhoto credit: Patrick McMullan - Getty Images More\n\nPaltrow also told Guthrie that her daughter played a part in her decision to speak out.\n\n\"I think also having a teenage daughter that's the love of my life and worrying about her going into the workplace, and feeling like if there was ever a chance that there could be a cultural shift on this stuff, I wanted to participate in,\" she said. \"I never could have imagined that collectively a shift this seismic would happen, but I feel proud that I have a small part in it.\u201d\n\nAt the time of Paltrow's initial allegations, spokesman for Weinstein told the Times, \"Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. He will not be available for further comments, as he is taking the time to focus on his family, on getting counselling and rebuilding his life.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The actress' daughter influenced her decision", "authors": ["Chelsey Sanchez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JkZ2KTV.fVEP1Mvix7D9gQ--~B/aD01MTQ7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_111/f76f444e93f728aca6d4defaa6624974", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
