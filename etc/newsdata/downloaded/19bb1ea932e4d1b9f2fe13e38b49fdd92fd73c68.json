On Broadway, there are fewer big-gamble musicals than last season, with producers opting for a steady supply of jukebox, from Tina Turner to Alanis Morrissette, but there are also straight play imports from London and summer theater festivals, as well improv rap, just to mix things up. Elsewhere, you\u2019ll find intriguing revivals, directors taking big swings, and of course, many gestating movie-to-musical adaptations.\n\nWhat We Think Will Be Great\n\nBy Sara Holdren\n\nSeptember\n\nHeroes of the Fourth Turning (Playwrights Horizons; previews 9/13)\n\nWill Arbery\u2019s vertigo-inducing Plano was one of the highlights of the spring. With Heroes of the Fourth Turning, the Texas-raised playwright dares to wade into some murky waters with the story of four young conservatives descending into existential chaos at a party in Wyoming. Arbery\u2019s writing is spooky and wry without being twee, generous without na\u00efvet\u00e9, and I\u2019m ready for his take on America\u2019s middle and its far right.\n\nScotland, PA (Laura Pels Theater; 9/14\u201312/8. Buy tickets here.)\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m psyched or nervous about Roundabout\u2019s new musical adaptation of filmmaker Billy Morrissette\u2019s 2001 riff on Macbeth, which sets Shakespeare\u2019s bloody tragedy in a sleepy Pennsylvania town where a burger-joint manager and his wife take matters (and deadly deep fryers) into their own hands. The movie is eerie, sly, gruesome fun, and features Christopher Walken in the Macduff role and Andy Dick as a Weird Sister \u2014 that\u2019s a tall, eccentric order for any adaptation, and it will be a creepy treat to see how the musical\u2019s vaunting ambition plays out.\n\nThe Inheritance (The Barrymore; previews 9/27. Buy tickets here.)\n\nElisabeth Vincentelli recently wrote about the frustrating discrepancy between Broadway\u2019s historical embrace of gay and lesbian stories, and she\u2019s not wrong. Even so, I find myself eager to see this epic two-parter inspired by E. M. Forster\u2019s Howards End. Matthew Lopez\u2019s exploration of lineage tells the story of a group of gay men in New York a generation after the aids crisis. Directed by Stephen Daldry, it\u2019s an ambitious attempt to continue Angels in America\u2019s \u201cgreat work,\u201d as well as winner of the 2019 Olivier for Best New Play \u2014 but truly, they had me at Forster.\n\nOctober\n\nHamnet (BAM Next Wave Festival; 10/30\u201311/3)\n\nThis year\u2019s Next Wave lineup \u2014 which features a deconstructed Swan Lakeand a Three Sisters riff played out in two different spaces, with one audience watching half the play as a live film \u2014 is full of fascinating stuff. Especially enticing is Hamnet, a new play by the Irish theater company Dead Centre that explores mortality, legacy, and longing through the eyes of a boy who died when he was 11 years old \u2014 and who happened to be the son of the most famous playwright of all time.\n\nNovember\n\nThe Crucible (Bedlam @ the Connelly; 11/8\u201312/29)\n\nThe ingenious, scrappy magicians of Eric Tucker\u2019s Bedlam dismantle and reassemble classics with a playful, rigorous hand. If their rendition of Arthur Miller\u2019s fiery McCarthy-era cautionary tale The Crucible is as invigoratingly actor- and argument-driven as their fierce, funny, stripped-down Saint Joan, it will probably cut closer to the heart of the matter than the show\u2019s last Broadway outing, levitation, live \u201cwolf,\u201d and all.\n\nFefu and Her Friends (Theatre for a New Audience; 11/16\u201312/8)\n\nThe wise and radical Cuban-American playwright Mar\u00eda Irene Forn\u00e9s died late last year, and it\u2019s thrilling to see her formula-defying plays popping up again. Encores! recently revived her absurdist musical Promenade, and this fall, Lileana Blain-Cruz takes on one of Forn\u00e9s\u2019s best-known works, the enigmatic story of a gathering of women at a New England country house in 1935. Perspectives are constantly shifting in Fefu, a landmark of feminist theater that grapples with internalized sexism.\n\nDecember\n\nKeep (St. Ann\u2019s Warehouse; 12/4\u201312/19)\n\nThe monologuist Daniel Kitson once made me weep profusely by sitting at a desk and reading a story about Santa. Also with a story about a weird lonely writer and a weird lonely woman and a weird lonely mouse. Also by talking about the flat he once lived in in London. He\u2019s unsentimental and heartbreaking, part comedian, part raconteur, and part solo theater magician, and I can\u2019t wait for this meditation on regret, hope, and \u201cthe inevitable sadness of ever holding on to anything.\u201d\n\nJudgment Day (Park Avenue Armory; 12/5\u20131/11)\n\nRichard Jones single-handedly convinced me that theaters should keep tackling Eugene O\u2019Neill with his invigorating 2017 production of The Hairy Ape. I\u2019ve already got palpitations about his return to the cavernous dream castle that is the Armory with this adaptation of a criminally underproduced masterpiece by \u00d6d\u00f6n von Horv\u00e1th about a station master whose fleeting inattention causes a tragedy that sends his community into a devastating spiral.\n\nWhat We Think Will Be Big\n\nBy Jackson McHenry\n\nSeptember\n\nFreestyle Love Supreme (Booth Theatre; previews 9/13. Buy tickets here.)\n\nBefore there was Hamilton, there was Freestyle Love Supreme, an improvisational music group created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, director Thomas Kail, and Anthony Veneziale. The evening is essentially a casual hang, with the promise of \u201cspontaneous and unannounced guests.\u201d\n\nThe Sound Inside (Studio 54; previews 9/14. Buy tickets here.)\n\nMary-Louise Parker returns to Broadway for \u2014 what else? \u2014 a harrowing interior drama in which she plays a professor who becomes uncomfortably close to a student.\n\nLinda Vista (Helen Hayes Theater; previews 9/19)\n\nOne of two Tracy Letts productions on Broadway this season (alongside The Minutes, premiering in February), this is a dark comedy about a 50-year-old man (Ian Barford) trying to recover from a divorce.\n\nSoft Power (Public Theater; 9/24\u201311/3. Buy tickets here.)\n\nImagine The King and I but with all the sweeping cultural assumptions reversed. That\u2019s what David Henry Hwang (M. Butterfly) set out to do with this musical, which depicts contemporary America from China\u2019s point of view.\n\nOctober\n\nCyrano (Daryl Roth Theatre; previews 10/11)\n\nPeter Dinklage arrives in town from Game of Thrones\u2013land to sing in a musical version of Edmond Rostand\u2019s 19th-century classic, with music from members of the National.\n\nTina: The Tina Turner Musical (Lunt-Fontanne Theater; previews 10/12. Buy tickets here.)\n\nIn the footsteps of Cher and Donna Summer and many others, Tina Turner gets her own bio-musical, a form that\u2019s practically its own genre at this point. Watch out for star Adrienne Warren, who earned an Olivier nomination for the part in London.\n\nNovember\n\nJagged Little Pill (Broadhurst Theatre; previews 11/3. Buy tickets here.)\n\nAlanis Morissette\u2019s songs are reassembled into an original story, written by Diablo Cody, about a family going through some seriously dark times. Think Mamma Mia! but gritty.\n\n*This article appears in the September 2, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
