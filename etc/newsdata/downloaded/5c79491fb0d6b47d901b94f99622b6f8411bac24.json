The union let the GM contract expire at midnight Saturday, but told autoworkers with Sunday shifts to report.\n\nThe union represents about 46,000 GM autoworkers at 55 facilities in the United States. No talks were known to be scheduled.\n\nA prolonged strike against GM could be painful for both sides, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor.\n\nUAW contract with GM expires: Union says 'significant differences' remain\n\nShutting down North American production costs GM about $400 million a day, said Dziczek. It\u2019s also a big sacrifice for UAW workers, who get only $250 a week in strike wages, she noted. The union had $721 million in its strike fund in 2018 and temporarily increased dues in March this year to boost it to $850 million.\n\nGM has 90-100 days of inventory for most of the vehicles that are in high demand, Dziczek said. Consumers might find it harder to get certain colors or trims after a couple of weeks, but dealers trade with each other and that will help.\n\n\u201cGM has enough inventory for a short strike of one or two weeks. After that it starts to get painful,\u201d Dziczek said.\n\nThe strike announcement follows a meeting Sunday morning of GM union local presidents from around the country, gathering in a Marriott hotel in the same building as GM's Detroit headquarters.The UAW said the nearly 175 union local leaders on the National Council voted unanimously to strike.\n\n\u201cWe are standing up for our members and for the fundamental rights of working-class people of this nation,\u201d said Terry Dittes, the union's GM department vice president. \u201cGoing into the bargaining season, our members have been very clear of what they will and will not accept in this contract.\u201d\n\nWhen GM face bankruptcy 10 years ago, Dittes said, \u201dOur membership and the American taxpayer stood up and made the hard choices and sacrifices for this company.\u201d\n\nHe said the union members have continued to build quality products that have led to big GM profits, so it is time for GM to step up.\n\nGM contract offer\n\nGM said its offer to the UAW included more than $7 billion in U.S. investments over the four-year life of a new deal, more than 5,400 jobs, higher pay and what the company said would be improved benefits.\n\n\u201cWe presented a strong offer that improves wages, benefits and grows U.S. jobs in substantive ways and it is disappointing that the UAW leadership has chosen to strike at midnight tonight,\" the company said. \"We have negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency. Our goal remains to build a strong future for our employees and our business.\u201d\n\nJack Barber, 57, of Clio leans out looking to get honks from passing cars for support as he and other UAW members from Locals 598 and 659 strike prior to the union leadership authorizing the autoworker strike in front of the General Motors Flint Assembly plant in Flint, Michigan on Sunday, September 15, 2019. More\n\nThe company said it offered improved profit sharing; what it called \"solutions for unallocated assembly plants in Michigan and Ohio\"; a ratification payment of $8,000 and enabling the union to \"retain nationally leading health care benefits.\"\n\n\"Unallocated assembly plants\" refers to GM's decision announced last fall that it would indefinitely idle four of its U.S. plants. The UAW vowed to leave no stone unturned in fighting to get new vehicles to build in those plants, which include Lordstown Assembly in Ohio, Detroit-Hamtramck and transmission plants in Warren and Baltimore.", "description": "The UAW contract with GM expired at midnight Saturday and the union on Sunday called for a strike of all 46,000 GM workers in the US.", "authors": ["Jamie L.
