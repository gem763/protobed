They also worried about damage to forecasters\u2019 morale. Jacobs\u2019s letter was a clear conciliatory effort to address those two concerns head-on.\n\n\u201cThe American people are depending on our agency,\u201d Jacobs wrote. \u201cThere is no question in my mind that we will continue to provide expert analyses and predictions to keep Americans safe, and that all our line and staff offices will support the American public during these events. Our work saves lives.\u201d\n\nJacobs added that he plans to visit forecast offices around the country to initiate a dialogue with staff.\n\nMichael Halpern, deputy director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, wrote in an email that Jacobs and NOAA are \u201ctaking the right steps to repair the damage\u201d from this whole saga.\n\n\u201cThe question will be whether Secretary Ross and the White House will make that same commitment,\u201d Halpern wrote. \u201cSo far, their silence has been telling.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats have launched an investigation into the matter, as have the Department of Commerce\u2019s inspector general and NOAA\u2019s acting chief scientist, Craig McLean. A key issue being probed is whether the NOAA statement violated the agency\u2019s scientific integrity policy.\n\nIn the closing line of his email, Jacobs touched on that very topic: \u201cOur team is committed to upholding scientific integrity.\u201d\n\nAndrew Freedman contributed to this report.", "description": "The email marked an apparent effort to repair damage from an unusual Sept. 6 statement that sided with President Trump rather than agency weather forecasters.", "authors": ["Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather", "September At Pm", "Jason Samenow Is The Washington Post S Weather Editor", "Capital Weather Gang'S Chief Meteorologist.
