The S&P 500 index\u2019s information-technology sector (which lost some of tech\u2019s biggest names in a sector change last year) is expected to see earnings decline more than 10%, mostly thanks to chips and the hardware and storage sectors.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: We are in an earnings recession, and it is expected to get worse\n\nSemiconductors are expected to have the worst results in all of tech, with earnings per share dropping a whopping 30% from last year\u2019s performance and sales projected to decline 11.5%, according to a FactSet survey of analysts\u2019 estimates that includes some reported numbers, such as last month\u2019s downbeat results from memory-chip kingpin Micron Technology Inc. MU, +1.97% MU, +1.97% MU, +1.97% in its data.\n\nMany analysts believe that those woeful third-quarter results reflect the bottom for the current semiconductor downturn, and companies have suggested the crunch is easing, including Micron in the season\u2019s first big tech-earnings test. Investors seem to believe it: The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index SOX, +2.05% has jumped nearly 38% this year, despite massive earnings and revenue declines.\n\nBut semiconductor companies suggested earlier this year that they should already be rebounding by now, and we still haven't seen it. A bounceback before the end of the year is far from a given because of the crosscurrents of a trade war with China, the PC upgrade cycle and the wait for 5G technology.\n\n\u201cHopefully we are at the end of the [down] cycle, but who knows,\u201d said Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein Research analyst who admitted that he was amazed at the continued high valuations of the semiconductor group overall.\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot of uncertainty,\u201d Rasgon said last week. \u201cThe trade talks are going every which way every day.\u201d He said he believes investors seem to have a bit of fear of missing out. \u201cThe sector is typically anticipatory,\u201d he said, adding that investors \u201care afraid not to be there\u201d when the news gets better.\n\nSee also: The five companies most at fault for the earnings recession\n\nThe news hasn\u2019t necessarily gotten better in the early days of this earnings season. Texas Instruments Inc. TXN, +1.77% gave a very disappointing fourth-quarter forecast and executives made comments about customer concerns that led at least one analyst to question the entire sector.\n\n\u201cI think we can\u2019t rule out, obviously, customers having built inventory in preparations for builds or concerns with the trade tensions, but the weakness that we saw wasn\u2019t limited to any region, so it was very broad-based,\u201d Dave Paul, TI\u2019s vice president of investor relations, told analysts Tuesday. TI Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi told analysts, \u201cThis thing we\u2019ve been in, it [has been] for four quarters and it\u2019s going to be longer than that.\u201d\n\nXilinx Inc. XLNX, +1.91% was projected to be an outlier with positive growth, but gave a light forecast and blamed the ban on sales to Chinese tech giant Huawei, as well as continued data-center issues.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a pause in hyperscale customer orders\u201d in the calendar fourth quarter, Xilinx Chief Executive Victor Peng told analysts, adding that he expects growth to resume in Xilinx\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter, which will be calendar first quarter.\n\nIntel Corp. INTC, +8.10% seemed to offer the relief that chip investors had been waiting for by showing 4% growth in its data-center business when a contraction was expected, and raising its guidance. But that surprise gain was in part due to $200 million of orders that came in for the third quarter instead of the fourth ahead of anticipated tariffs, and caused analysts to doubt that the momentum can continue. After flying higher in late trading Thursday, Intel fell back to even in regular trading Friday.\n\nEven with the doubts, though, chip companies might be in a better position than storage vendors. That subsector, officially known as \u201cTechnology Hardware Storage and Peripherals,\u201d is expected to fare slightly better than semiconductors, but that is largely because it includes Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.23% and HP Inc. HPQ, +1.23%.\n\nStorage companies such as Western Digital Corp. WDC, +2.87% , Seagate Technology STX, +1.20% and NetApp Inc. NTAP, +1.01% have been slammed by cloud service providers taking a breather in their build-outs. Western Digital, for example, has seen earnings per share decline more than 90% in each of the past two quarters, and is expected to report a 90%-plus decline yet again when it reports Oct. 30. Seagate\u2019s earnings are expected to drop about 47%.\n\nRead more about the mixed signals memory chip makers have given about a rebound\n\n\u201cWe felt that there would be a slowing in demand in the first half of this calendar year and then we expect the demand to increase in the second half of the calendar year,\u201d Robert Eulau, Western Digital Chief Financial Officer, told investors at a conference last month. \u201cAnd that\u2019s effectively what\u2019s played out and we\u2019ve done very well from a hard-drive standpoint with the hyperscalers, really pleased with how we\u2019re positioned there and the market share that we have.\u201d\n\nWith less than three months left in the second half that both chip companies and storage companies have said would bring about a rebound, we still haven\u2019t seen it. This column warned early this year that optimism about a second-half comeback for chips came with very little evidence, and so far we have still seen little to suggest a sustained recovery. Still, analysts expect the rebound to begin in the holiday season, with current projections calling for hardware earnings to move to growth in the fourth quarter while the decline in chips is expected to shrink to about 21% instead of this quarter\u2019s 30%.\n\nBut if semiconductor and storage companies can\u2019t hit those forecasts, and if TI and Xilinx end up being leading examples, the crosscurrents are likely going to suddenly go in the same direction: Down. And tech stocks could go right along with them.", "description": "Mixed signals from the companies that make core internal components of tech hardware \u2014 memory chips and storage devices \u2014 are fueling expectations for...", "authors": ["Therese Poletti"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT964_it_sec_ZG_20191024124637.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
