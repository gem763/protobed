If you look at the children of pathological narcissists, noted Baird, their symptoms look a lot like many of ours: \u201cAnxiety, foreboding, depression, anger, frustration, fear, bewilderment at the state of the universe.\u201d Their minds have been annexed; they doubt their perceptions. \u201cWhat they know to be real,\u201d he said, \u201cis itself challenged by this person\u2019s actions and statements and deeds.\u201d\n\n(Online, in fact, there\u2019s a shadow universe of children of pathological narcissists, who argue that \u201cwhat\u2019s happening on a national level is activating and retraumatizing a lot of people who have been gaslighted in the past,\u201d in the words of the writer and memoirist Ariel Leve.)\n\nNaturally there are limits to how far one can take this analogy. Trump got 46 percent of the vote in 2016, and polls say that roughly 43 percent of Americans still support him. They likely feel emboldened by the president, not traumatized by him. But the distressed-children model would explain why congressional Republicans who privately despise the president still support him in public. \u201cThey live in fear that the narcissist will turn on them,\u201d said Baird. So they try to manage the unmanageable. They keep two sets of books, function with two different brains, and buy in \u2014 at least partly \u2014 to Trump\u2019s grandiose message: You\u2019d be worthless without me.\n\nJournalists have a different problem. If pathological narcissists derive their power from attention, we ought not to give it to them. But under ordinary circumstances, almost anything that comes out of the president\u2019s mouth is considered news. Maybe it\u2019s time, in earnest, to re-examine this notion. An Australian journalist, recently writing for The Guardian, noted that we often render Trump more coherent than he in fact is, spinning word salads into orderly sentences, rendering caprice as deliberate policy.", "description": "To say that we find ourselves in a dysfunctional relationship is an understatement.", "authors": ["Jennifer Senior"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/12/opinion/12senior2/12senior2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
