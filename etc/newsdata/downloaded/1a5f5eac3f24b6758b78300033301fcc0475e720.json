Speaking to reporters in Nova Scotia on Thursday, Scheer said he initiated the process to officially renounce his U.S. citizenship in August. His campaign also said he has not renewed his passport as an adult. But Scheer still struggled to explain why he had never publicly mentioned his dual nationalities before.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com World Politicians-Around-World-Sometimes-Face-An-Awkward-Problem-Their-Us-Citizenship"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
