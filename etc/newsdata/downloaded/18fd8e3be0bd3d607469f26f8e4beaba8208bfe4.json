impossible for any individual who wished to protest to know which protest they could join and which they could not.\n\n\u201cThe condition clearly failed to distinguish between assemblies and protesters participating in assemblies.\u201d\n\nMs Kaufmann told the court the autumn uprising was \u201cintended to encourage multiple assemblies, by multiple groups, in multiple locations on multiple dates\u201d.\n\nThose bringing the action include Baroness Jenny Jones and Caroline Lucas MP, both of the Green Party, Labour MP Clive Lewis and campaigner and journalist George Monbiot \u2013 who was arrested after the ban came into force.\n\nBefore the hearing, Ms Lucas said: \u201cThe police use of a Section 14 order to ban all Extinction Rebellion protests across the whole of London was a huge over-reach of police powers.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is

They won\u2019t be silenced by a police crackdown, nor should they be in a free democratic society.\u201d\n\nThe Met contends the ban, which is no longer in place, was lawful and the only way of tackling the disruption caused by XR.\n\nLawyers for the force said it was \u201cclear and undeniable\u201d XR regarded the autumn uprising as a single protest and it was an \u201cestablished tactic\u201d of the group to \u201cmove around and change locations to frustrate law enforcement\u201d.\n\nThey said when the ban was imposed it was not possible for the police to keep the disruption caused by XR to an \u201cacceptable minimum\u201d, and indications were it would \u201ccontinue and evolve in worrying ways\u201d.\n\nIn documents submitted to the court on behalf of the Met, barrister George Thomas said: \u201cThis is not a passing inconvenience. It is not the price to be paid in a democratic society that embraces the freedoms of expression and assembly.\n\n\u201cIt is very serious disruption that has the potential to impact on public safety ... and a direct, adverse impact on huge numbers of residents, visitors or workers in central London.\n\n\u201cThese people also have rights that are to be balanced against the rights of the protesters.\u201d\n\nMr Thomas said the costs of policing the autumn uprising were in excess of \u00a320m, adding: \u201cAgain this is not the price to be paid for facilitating lawful protest.\n\n\u201cThe great majority of this has been incurred entirely unnecessarily, as a result of the need to respond to deliberate unlawful action by XR.\u201d\n\nFrom 7 October, the group staged 10 days of protests to call for urgent action on climate change and wildlife losses.\n\nThe Met used Section 14 of the Public Order Act initially to restrict the protest action to Trafalgar Square, but following \u201ccontinued breaches\u201d of the order, officers moved in to clear the area.\n\nThe force said 1,832 people were arrested, and more than 150 were charged with offences.\n\nXR\u2019s stated tactics are to cause \u201cmaximum disruption\u201d and to overwhelm the capacity in police custody, including by refusing bail after being arrested.\n\nLord Justice Dingemans and Mr Justice Chamberlain are expected to give their ruling on the case at a later date.\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "The Metropolitan Police\u2019s London-wide ban on Extinction Rebellion\u00a0(XR) protests was \u201can abuse of power\u201d, High Court judges have heard.
