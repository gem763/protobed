Free speech is under assault it seems, with students no-platforming guest speakers because they hurt their feelings. Political correctness is absolutely roiling higher education. Students are vandalising curriculums, forcing their teachers to replace white authors with those of colour, demanding trigger warnings ahead of classes on classic works of literature, and calling for safe spaces to be set up to exclude others for no reason other than their racial background or sexuality. You can\u2019t even clap at events any more because student unions think it\u2019s overwhelming for those with PTSD. The solution? Jazz hands, apparently.\n\nStudents accuse Goldsmiths University of watering down racism report Read more\n\nIt is likely that some of this is already familiar to you, if not in the detail then in the mood music. There is now a mini-industry within the media, often backed up by unquestioning politicians, based on the idea that Britain\u2019s universities are going to the dogs. But let me tell you about another crisis that you probably haven\u2019t heard of. In 2018, it was reported that the number of racist incidents in universities across the UK had surged by more than 60% in the two years preceding. A freedom of information request by the Independent showed a similar rise in the number of religiously motivated hate crimes at universities. Antisemitic or Islamophobic incidents were reported in 26 UK universities. The situation became so dire that the Equality and Human Rights Commission, a public body in England and Wales that promotes and enforces equality and non-discrimination laws in the UK, launched an official inquiry into what seemed to be an epidemic of racism. A Warwick University student discovered racial slurs written on bananas he had stored in a shared kitchen. In 2018, two 18-year-old men were arrested after a Nottingham Trent University student posted video footage of racist chants, including \u201cwe hate the blacks\u201d, outside her bedroom door in her student halls.\n\nIn July this year, another freedom of information investigation by the Guardian revealed not only widespread evidence of discrimination in higher education but, according to interviewees, an \u201cabsolute resistance to facing the scale of racism in British universities\u201d. Last week, senior staff at Goldsmiths, University of London, supposedly the wokest of Britain\u2019s colleges, said that its record of addressing racism was \u201cunacceptable\u201d after a report found that black and minority ethnic students felt victimised and unsafe.\n\nThis disconnect between reality and the myths is not a matter of sloppiness or poor reporting, it is ideological\n\nIncidents tend to receive public attention only when they are circulated on social media. Ayo Olatunji, the black and minority ethnic students\u2019 officer for University College London, told the Guardian in 2018: \u201cWe would hear about a case [every] day in the media if everything that happened went online.\u201d Instead, we hear about other things.\n\nWhat has cut through is not the widespread racism and the institutional failure to deal with it, but the PC \u201ccrisis\u201d, evidence of which is sometimes simply made up. In 2017, students wrote an open letter to the faculty of English at Cambridge University requesting that non-white authors be added to the curriculum. Four months later, following precisely zero complaints from fellow students or members of the faculty, the Daily Telegraph published a black female student\u2019s picture on its front page with the headline \u201cStudent forces Cambridge to drop white authors\u201d. This was not true. Not only had Cambridge not dropped any white authors, the open letter did not make any such request in the first place, nor was the featured student the sole signatory. A day after the story ran, the paper issued a correction on page two.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2018, the libertarian website Spiked published \u201cFree Speech Rankings\u201d of universities, which supposedly showed the extent to which censorship is rife on campuses. But writing in Times Higher Education, the University of Surrey\u2019s Carl Thompson called the rankings \u201cmisleading, ill-informed and worryingly influential\u201d. He found that \u201cabout 85% to 90% of Spiked\u2019s evidence each year amounts merely to human resources policies and codes of conduct, of a sort now standard in most large organisations and often required by law\u201d. That did not stop the Spiked research being widely quoted.\n\nElite universities are too obsessed with tradition to tackle racism effectively | Clive Nwonka Read more\n\nThis disconnect between reality and the myths circulating about Britain\u2019s universities is not a matter of sloppiness or poor reporting, it is ideological. University campuses have always made the establishment nervous, with student bodies easily able to organise around progressive causes. The targeting of these spaces is an old weapon in the culture wars, one that aims to discredit and discourage challenges to the status quo from the left, and from marginalised groups whose entry into the mainstream happens via higher education.\n\nBut students have somehow been vandalising academic freedom since at least the 1960s without bringing about a political coup run by ethnic minorities and queer people. The reality is that universities in the UK remain deeply conservative organisations that not only do not coddle students\u2019 minds, but also fail to protect them against the most basic violations. So I ask you again, have you heard about the real crisis on British campuses?\n\n\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Far from cracking down on every microaggression, institutions are failing in their basic duty to protect their students , says Guardian columnist Nesrine Malik", "authors": ["Nesrine Malik"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b6c69af35c5eacac05c8acae59c77e58ad5435a/0_112_3008_1805/master/3008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b71fba263d0b866d1e4b7d9a12aecaa4", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
