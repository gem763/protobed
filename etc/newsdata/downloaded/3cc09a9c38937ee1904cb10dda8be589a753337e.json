(See the video above.)\n\n\u201cThe prime example is Adam Schiff,\u201d the host said on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight.\u201d (This coming from a guy who called white supremacy a hoax.)\n\nCarlson was leading into Schiff\u2019s improvised version of President Donald Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, in which the president repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter as U.S. military aid was temporarily blocked.\n\nThen Carlson, who declared that it\u2019s \u201chard to believe\u201d that Trump\u2019s actions are an impeachable offense, ratcheted up his takedown of the California lawmaker.\n\n\u201cHe recently went into a kind of trance and delivered his own prophetic version of what he believed must have happened between President Trump and the president of Ukraine,\u201d said Carlson, who showed a clip of Thursday\u2019s congressional hearing chaired by Schiff. \u201d... Keep in mind, that isn\u2019t some guy babbling in the men\u2019s room at Starbucks. That is the man who chairs the mighty House Intelligence Committee. We trust him with the most sensitive information, and yet he is clearly, demonstrably mentally ill.\u201d\n\nRelated...\n\nDonald Trump Slams Fox News For His Brutally Bad Polling Numbers\n\nTucker Carlson: I\u2019d Never Let My Daughter Date A Feminist Man\n\nFox War: Tucker Carlson And Shep Smith Are Feuding On Live TV\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
