Her company, Shobana Jeyasingh Dance, is currently celebrating its 30th anniversary. Jeyasingh has collaborated with musicians, writers, film-makers, mathematicians and animators, among others. Her new piece, Staging Schiele, will tour from 18 October to Ipswich, Tewkesbury, Belfast and Huddersfield, ending at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, 4 and 5 November.\n\nStaging Schiele is inspired by the work of the Austrian artist Egon Schiele. What drew you to him?\n\nIt was happenstance. During my research for my last piece, Contagion (2018), which was about the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, I went to an exhibition of Schiele\u2019s work, and I realised he\u2019d been a victim. He was only 28 when he died. He was very prescient. In much of his early work he was interested in the body as a corpse, with the potential for decay. This was what was happening in Europe, with the war and then the pandemic.\n\nAnd he was an amazing graphic artist. He\u2019s a brilliant amalgam of rigour of line and the emotional narrative that comes from those lines. Contemporary dance doesn\u2019t have a story like ballet does, so choreographers are interested in the psychological landscape built out of elements like framing and line.\n\nSchiele\u2019s engagement with women interested me too. You mostly don\u2019t see a great sense of autonomy from the painted nude \u2013 she\u2019s neutralised by the painter. Schiele imparted a greater sense of agency, even though he painted women who were socially not very powerful \u2013 they were usually from working class or lower-middle class backgrounds.\n\nThe inspiration for your pieces is wide-ranging \u2013 Schiele, Rodin, the Spanish flu, La Bayad\u00e8re, to name a few. Do you have a favourite?\n\nIf I had to chose one, it would be In Flagrante (2014), a short dance film I made in collaboration with film-maker Ravi Deepres. It gave me a lot of satisfaction because it was a subject that gave me pause: I was commissioned to make a piece about cell division for an exhibition. I had to do a lot of learning, but I was working with the geneticist Dr Kim Nasmyth; the man was so passionate about his subject that it was easy to learn.\n\nThis year is the 30th anniversary of your company. How has the dance world changed in that time?\n\nWhen I started, there was huge public confidence in funding for the arts \u2013 there was a feeling that the core script of the nation included the arts. You\u2019d look to the Arts Council for funding. Now that\u2019s changed, for economic reasons more than anything else, and the funding model is closer to business than ever. I think branding has now become a much more potent concept for artists, not necessarily in the making of the art but in the delivery of the art \u2013 marketing, social media, how you get your audience.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t a choreographer, what would you be?\n\nI\u2019d love to be a film-maker. It\u2019s not dissimilar to being a choreographer. Instead of a camera frame, choreographers have the stage. The audience is still sitting there, it\u2019s the same gaze \u2013 you\u2019re dealing with light, bodies, perspective, in a similar way. But of course what the film-maker has is the luxury of structuring in retrospect \u2013 he can go away and work with his editor.\n\nThe best dance of the 21st century Read more\n\nWhat is your biggest professional triumph or disaster?\n\nOh, there were tons of disasters\u2026 Triumphs? When I first started the company, I made this piece called Romance\u2026 With Footnotes, in 1994 or 1995, and we won the Prudential awards for the arts \u2013 the prize money was \u00a3100,000! It was an amazing start for a very young company. That\u2019s an obvious triumph. But, also, one can\u2019t live on those triumphs for ever.\n\nFor more everyday triumphs\u2026 when we toured Contagion, it was shown at IWM North in Manchester, on a Saturday morning. There was a mother there with two very young kids who came to talk to me at the end. The six-year-old girl asked such amazing questions about what she\u2019d seen: I\u2019d engaged her in a 20-minute piece about the Spanish flu. I treasure those moments.", "description": "The choreographer on her new work inspired by Egon Schiele, the changing world of dance, and the allure of film-making", "authors": ["Ka Bradley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e77cd8544718a56320abb5801e3ad30f0a65feaa/0_241_2101_1260/master/2101.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2b4533f354a7a8a29bb4a6b1e62fddc", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
