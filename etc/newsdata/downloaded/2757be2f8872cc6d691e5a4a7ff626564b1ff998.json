The two sides are due to meet for a final day on Friday.\n\nNegotiators could agree to low-level \"early harvest\" agreements on issues such as currencies and copyright protections, despite increased irritants between the world's two largest economies, a US Chamber of Commerce official briefed by both sides said earlier on Thursday.\n\nMyron Brilliant, the Chamber's head of international affairs, said negotiators were \"trying to find a path towards the bigger deal\" with progress on market access and less controversial intellectual property and other issues.\n\n\"I believe that there's even the possibility of a currency agreement this week. I think that could lead to a decision by the US administration to not put forth a tariff rate hike on October 15.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump launched the trade war against China with demands for sweeping structural reforms, but Beijing has indicated it is not willing to fundamentally change the way it controls China's economy.\n\nSteady escalations of the tit-for-tat tariffs on Chinese and US goods in recent months have roiled financial markets and stoked fears of a global recession.\n\nStocks rose on optimism that talks would yield at least a partial truce, with the S &P 500 up 0.64 per cent and the Nasdaq up 0.6 per cent.\n\nThe mood surrounding the talks had soured earlier this week when the US government blacklisted 28 Chinese public security bureaus, technology and surveillance firms, including video surveillance gear maker Hikvision, over allegations of abuses of Muslim minorities in China.\n\nWashington also restricted visas for certain Chinese officials over the same issue and Beijing was said to be planning to tighten visa restrictions for some US nationals.\n\nThe two sides have been at loggerheads over US demands that China improve protections of American intellectual property, end cyber theft and the forced transfer of technology to Chinese firms, curb industrial subsidies and increase US companies' access to largely closed Chinese markets.\n\nWith Reuters\n\nAAP", "description": "US Commerce Secretary's visit to Australia has been cut short as news broke that President Trump would meet China\u2019s vice premier Liu He,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3624%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_57%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fcfb740a8b37e2eeb14ffea404519be58c721cba", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
