This is discrimination.'\n\nBatts formally filed a lawsuit against the school on Monday in Queens Supreme Court.\n\nA New York mother is suing a Catholic school after she says they discriminated against he 8-year-old sons cornrows\n\nImmaculate Conception Catholic Academy was supposed to be a clean slate for 3rd grade student Jediah, who previously spent three years in a low-performing public school.\n\nBatts spent $275 for the school registration fee and $250 for the school's mandated uniform, compete with a button down shirt and tie.\n\nJediah started at the pre-K through eighth grade school on September 4 and instantly feel in love.\n\nHis mother says he felt welcomed by his teacher and his fellow students accepted him.\n\nBut those happy would quickly shift by days end.\n\nWhen Jediah's grandmother arrived at the school to pick him up, the principal reportedly told her, 'we don't accept this,' while rubbing the boy's head.\n\nThe lawsuit against Immaculate Conception Catholic Academy was filed on Monday, October 28, at the Queens Supreme Court (pictured)\n\nJoan Batts, Jediah's grandmother, was bewildered by the principal's statement.\n\nShe told DailyMail.com: 'It was shocking. It really took me off guard.'\n\n'This is such an emotional situation.'\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, the school's handbook says boys must maintain hair that is: 'neat and trim, no longer than the top of the shirt collar. No designs, Mohawks, pony tail, braids, buns, no hair color.'\n\nJediah told his mother he didn't agree.\n\nBatts said: 'He loves his hair. He feels like it makes him look good, it\u2019s a part of him. He\u2019s a very smart boy.'\n\nPictured: Immaculate Conception Catholic Academy in Queens, New York, where Jediah was allegedly discriminated against\n\n'He knows what he wants and he\u2019s not going to let anyone change his mind about anything.'\n\nAnd Batts was indignant that the principal felt it was okay to say such comments in front of Jediah.\n\n'You\u2019re now making him feel like he\u2019s unacceptable,' Batts said.\n\nBatts, who was at an impasse, reached out to the principal in hopes that they could come to an agreement.\n\nShe didn't want to remove Jediah from a school he loved, but didn't want to sacrifice his hair to stay.\n\nUnfortunately, Immaculate Conception Catholic Academy refused to bend and stated they had five days to change Jediah's hair.\n\nCornrows (pictured) and other natural hairstyles have been protected from discrimination in New York since July of this year\n\nA school staff member reportedly told Batts that other Catholic schools would have the same protocol.\n\nBatts took the risk, pulling her son from Immaculate Conception and enrolled Jediah in another Catholic school.\n\nIn the end she found a public school that was a better fit.\n\nAt the time, a lawsuit was not on Batts mind.\n\nShe said: 'I was more concerned about finding him a new school. I fully felt like this wasn\u2019t right, but my head was like, the bigger issue is my son needs to go to school to get an education.'\n\nMeanwhile, Joan Batts was researching the law.\n\nNew York became the second state behind California to pass a law banning discrimination based on natural hair.\n\nThe NYC Commission on Human Rights released a Legal Enforcement Guidance on Race Discrimination on the Basis of Hair.\n\nPictured: a portion of the NYC Commission on Human Rights guidelines prohibiting discrimination against natural hair\n\nIt says: 'Bans or restrictions on natural hair or hairstyles associated with Black people are often rooted in white standards of appearance and perpetuate racist stereotypes that Black hairstyles are unprofessional.'\n\n'Schools may not infringe on students\u2019 free expression rights \u201cunless school authorities have reason to believe that such expression will \"substantially interfere with the work of the school or impinge upon the rights of other students.\u2019\n\n'Because natural hair and locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, fades, and Afros are a form of hair maintenance and cultural identity and expression most closely associated with Black people, no school covered under the NYCHRL may prohibit such styles in New York City.'\n\nOliver Koppell, Batts's lawyer, says the law does grant exceptions for religious doctrine.\n\n'But I\u2019ve never heard of hair being part of the Catholic religion,' he said.\n\nKoppell, whose office handles discrimination cases of all kinds, says this is the first case his practice will pursue that deals with race-based hair discrimination.\n\nHe told DailyMail.com that although it is not confirmed, this case may be the first of its kind in New York after the new law has been passed.\n\nBatts is suing to get back enrollment and uniform costs, as well as emotional damages.\n\nShe said: 'You\u2019d think a Catholic school is about Christ and love. What does a hairdo have to do with that?'\n\nOther institutions are addressing and accommodating grooming protocols to stop discrimination against natural hairstyles.\n\nAmong other institutions, the United States Army has reworked their grooming regulations to better include natural hairstyles after previously banning many of them\n\nIn 2014, the United States Army relented to harsh public criticism and allowed woman to wear two-strand twists and increased the size of acceptable braids.\n\nThree years later the Army lifted the ban on locs.\n\nNew policies state locs must: 'be of uniform dimension; have a diameter no greater than a half-inch; and present a neat, professional and well-groomed appearance.'\n\nMany states, including New Jersey, Michigan and Tennessee, have proposed legislation to ban race-based hair discrimination, in a number of spaces.\n\nThis includes the work place.\n\nCalifornia passed the CROWN Act, or 'Create a Respectful and Open Workplace for Natural Hair.'\n\nThe law, which prohibits discrimination based on texture, was unanimously passed by both chambers in California legislature.\n\nIt was signed into law on July 3.", "description": "Lavona Batts says her 8-year-old son Jediah was faced discrimination at the hands of his former Catholic school in Queens, New York, after school officials said he had to remove his cornrows", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20381048-0-image-a-31_1572448365587.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
