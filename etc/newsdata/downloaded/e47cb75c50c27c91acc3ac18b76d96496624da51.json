The most recent episode of Boomerang\u2019s Scooby-Doo and Guess Who? would disagree.\n\nIn \u201cWhat a Night for a Dark Knight\u201d (a nod to the very first episode of the original Scooby-Doo series) Scooby and the Gang make their way to Gotham City of all places, because it just so happens that Daphne has a close connection with her \u201cuncle\u201d Alfie Pennyworth.\n\nAlfred, Daphne explains, once worked as her family\u2019s butler for a summer before eventually becoming a Blake family friend who frequently played on their polo team. Daphne\u2019s certain that Alfred will be elated to see her, but just as the gang enters Gotham\u2019s city limits, they\u2019re run off the road by a recklessly-driving Batman who\u2019s hightailing it somewhere in the Batmobile.\n\nBecause the kids and Scooby are all fans, they\u2019re too busy being excited to consider the fact that one of the world\u2019s most famous superheroes sent them into a tailspin and almost made them crash into a boulder \u2014 and their giddiness doesn\u2019t wear off until they arrive at Wayne Manor to find the place in shambles and Alfred quite missing.\n\nIt\u2019s here that the Scooby-Doo-ness of Guess Who kicks in, because as best as the kids can tell, there\u2019s a mystery to be solved, and hunting for clues around big, creepy houses is kind of their thing. The problem, of course, is that Wayne Manor isn\u2019t just any old house, and the teens aren\u2019t alone. Batman (voiced by Kevin Conroy, because of course he is) is there with them, but if he were to immediately reveal his presence to the kids, it would raise a number of questions about why, exactly, he was there given that no one at the residence, including Bruce Wayne, seems to be present.\n\nFred damn-near outing Bruce Wayne, which is PEAK COMEDY. (Image: Boomerang)\n\nAs Mystery Inc. wanders through the Manor, they do end up stumbling across a number of clues about who broke in and seemingly kidnapped Alfred, and \u201cWhat a Night for a Dark Knight\u201d cleverly riffs on the old-school Scooby-Doo narrative trappings by framing Batman himself as the creepy monster lurking in the shadows. While there is a proper criminal behind all the mayhem, the episode leans into the aspects of Batman\u2019s presence that make him such a frightening person when he\u2019s trying to intimidate villains \u2014 albeit through the lens of that kooky, spooky style of classic Scooby-Doo cartoons.\n\nBatman has no reason to immediately assume that the kids themselves aren\u2019t responsible for the break-in, and so he approaches them the way he would any other gang of brightly-dressed weirdos who rolled up into Gotham in a garish van: he stalks them and carefully traps them all with a variety of bat-themed gadgets, before rounding them all up for interrogation.\n\nThe entire point of Scooby-Doo and Guess Who? is to mine comedy out of the idea of famous people crossing paths with Mystery Inc. and getting into hijinks. When these guest stars are real people, the humour comes from their ability to go with the general flow of Scooby-Doo style jokes. But with characters like Batman who come from worlds with their own established rules regarding incidents like this, what\u2019s funny is Batman\u2019s inability to immediately grasp the full picture of the situation.\n\nWhen Fred tries to explain to Batman that they\u2019re all detectives (kinda), Batman straight-up doesn\u2019t understand. One imagines there\u2019s part of him that reacts that way because he doesn\u2019t think children should be getting into that kind of trouble \u2014 but that\u2019d be a rather hypocritical stance for him to take (see: his sidekicks.)\n\nIn this particular instance, it definitely seems like he\u2019s really just trying to get Mystery Inc. out of his way. But the more Batman speaks with the teens and the dog, it becomes increasingly obvious that they aren\u2019t the culprits and that if Batman isn\u2019t careful, they\u2019re definitely going to figure out his secret.\n\nWorking together, Batman and Mystery Inc. identify someone who appears to be Robert Langstrom, a.k.a. the Man-Bat, as the person who kidnapped Alfred, but when Batman learns that Langstrom hasn\u2019t left his cell at Arkham, he finally realises that the mystery was always the sort of situation the teens were somewhat more equipped to understand.\n\nAs always with Scooby-Doo, the monster\u2019s just a guy in a suit who the teens end up running away and hiding from, before attacking him in a convoluted plan that involves costumes, a hose, and a falling chandelier that traps their assailant, giving everyone a chance to unmask him. Batman isn\u2019t at all surprised to find the Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill, because, likewise, of course) behind it all, comically beneath a mask that is also beneath a Man-Bat costume head, but not because he\u2019d deduced his identity on his own.\n\nBatman admits that Velma provided him the necessary information to crack the case, and the Joker bemoans that he almost certainly would have gotten away with his plan to hack into Bruce Wayne\u2019s back accounts after the kidnapping were it not for Scooby-Doo and those meddling kids kinda messing everything up for him. You know how it goes.\n\nBy the episode\u2019s end, none of Mystery Inc. lets on that they might have put two and two together and figured out that Bruce Wayne and Batman are one and the same, and it\u2019s likely for the best.\n\nThey\u2019d all probably make excellent new additions to the Bat Family, but to become that, they\u2019d have to go through all sorts of messed up traumas that they\u2019re much better off avoiding since they can help it. That kind of grim darkness isn\u2019t Scooby\u2019s speed, which is why one of the last things you see as \u201cWhat a Night for a Dark Knight\u201d is the Mystery Machine parked out front ready to drive off.", "description": "One would think that Batman, often said to be the world\u2019s greatest detective, would be able to figure out a simple mystery involving a criminal dressed up in an animal costume more efficiently than a gang of meddling teenagers and their creepy talking dog.
