This is a first.\u201d\n\nScientists suspect that further study of K2-18b could reveal even more molecules that are key to life on Earth, such as nitrogen and methane. They also say that further examination of more than 4,000 other exoplanets could reveal other similarly promising worlds.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star's mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star's core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow.

It\u2019s orbiting a completely different star, so it doesn\u2019t look like Earth.\n\n\u201cThe search for habitable planets, it\u2019s very exciting, but it\u2019s here to always remind us that this is our only home and it\u2019s probably out of the question if we will be able to travel to other planets.\u201d\n\nAlthough the planet sits in the habitable zone, scientists say that instruments available at present are not able to determine any signs of life.\n\nMany more observations are needed to be sure that it is habitable.\n\nScientists, who have published their findings in the Nature Astronomy journal after more than a year of work, believe that the water content could be as low as 0.01 per cent or as high as 50 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how much water there is; however, what these models clearly say is that there is an atmosphere and that there is water there,\u201d said co-author Dr Ingo Waldmann.\n\nResearchers do not think K2-18b is the only potentially habitable super-Earth and expect to find others with similar characteristics among more than 4,000 exoplanets that have already been discovered.\n\nThey hope that newer technology, such as the James Webb Space Telescope due to launch in March 2021, will unlock more secrets beyond our solar system.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to the next generation of telescopes and going even further,\u201d Dr Tsiaras added.\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "Scientists have found water vapour on a \u201csuper-Earth\u201d for the first time \u2013 in a major step forward in the search for alien life.
