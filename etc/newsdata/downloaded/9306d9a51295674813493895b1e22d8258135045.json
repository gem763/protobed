Along the same timeframe, job postings are up about 80%.\n\nKraft Heinz - Job Postings\n\nGeneral Mills isn't alone on this - which is what makes it a compelling trend. Kellogg (NYSE: ), one of its biggest competitors, has seen shares grow in value more than 13% so far this year - but its pace of job posting growth is matching that of General Mills (NYSE: ). Job postings from Kellogg grew 90% so far this year.\n\nFor our final chart - the picture of a company bucking the trend, and for all the wrong reasons. So far this year Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: ) shares have looked a little more Heinz than Kraft (that's an NFL joke, folks), as it were. Job postings have dipped more than 20%, as the stock slid by more than 34% this year.\n\nAbout the Data:\n\nThinknum tracks companies using information they post online - jobs, social and web traffic, product sales and app ratings - and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Thinknum covering: General Mills Inc, Kraft Heinz Co, Kellogg Company.
