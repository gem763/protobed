Companies should expect that breaking workplace laws will end in a public court enforcement outcome Sandra Parker, Fair Work Ombudsman\n\nWhile the review was triggered by the new EBA, the workers affected are staff who manage supermarket departments, such as the deli or fruit and vegetables, who are not covered by the agreement.\n\nInstead, they are paid an annual salary that is supposed to buy out their entitlements to overtime or other penalty payments.\n\nHowever, they are still entitled to the minimum pay set down in the industry award.\n\nThe review, conducted by big four accounting firm PwC, discovered that the department managers had been underpaid because they worked shifts that, under the award, entitled them to more money than they received in their annual salaries.\n\nSivaraman said the \u201cmonster\u201d scale of the underpayment, in both time and dollars, raised questions about Woolworths\u2019 management of staff pay.\n\n\u201cI think more questions have to be asked about how this happened because we are talking about a large, well-resourced company,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does show that this concept of contracting out of an award through an annual salary doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nParker said she was frustrated at the number of large corporations confessing to wage underpayment and would take it up with company boards.\n\n\u201cSome of these matters go back many years and several comprise millions of dollars owed to workers,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is simply not good enough.\u201d\n\nCorporate Australia exhibited poor governance and complacency and carelessness towards employee entitlements, she said.\n\nAnd she signalled a tougher approach from a regulator that has been criticised for its unwillingness to take legal action.\n\n\u201cWe encourage corporates to cooperate with us to rectify breaches, but they must understand that admission is not absolution,\u201d she said. \u201cCompanies should expect that breaking workplace laws will end in a public court enforcement outcome.\u201d\n\nThe announcement overshadowed the release of Woolworths\u2019 first-quarter sales growth that, driven by the success of its Lion King Ooshies and Discovery Garden checkout giveaways, comfortably beat that announced on Tuesday by its fierce rival Coles.\n\nComparable sales at Woolworths supermarkets rose 6.6% on the same period a year ago, easily trumping the 0.1% at Coles.", "description": "Supermarket giant to be investigated by ombudsman in what is believed to be Australia\u2019s biggest wages underpayment case", "authors": ["Ben Butler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f9196461e38c36ab4033af9ea6713ff1c633450/6_197_2988_1794/master/2988.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe04573521adab375cf62eceb91154e9", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
