KLAC, +0.58% rose 0.2% in premarket trading Tuesday, adding to the previous session's rise to a record close, after the chip equipment maker raised its dividend by 13% and added $1 billion to its stock repurchase authorization. KLA new quarterly dividend of 85 cents a share is up from 75 cents a share. Based on Monday's stock closing price of $151.19, the new annual dividend rate of $3.40 a share implies a dividend yield of 2.25%, compared with the yield for the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, -0.67% of 1.35% and the implied yield for the S&P 500 SPX, -0.31% of 1.95%, according to FactSet.
