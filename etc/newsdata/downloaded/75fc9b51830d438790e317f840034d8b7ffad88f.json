It's going to be a very special night for all involved, I can't wait.\n\n'It's definitely a symbol that we are all behind. It is galvanising us, bringing us together.'\n\nAustralia will wear their indigenous-inspired away strip when they face Uruguay on Saturday\n\nA culture clash brought an odd misunderstanding between Samoa and Japan on Friday.\n\nAt their captain's run ahead of Saturday's game against the hosts the Samoan players used their phones to take pictures of the Toyota Stadium - and were admonished by a local reporter for doing so, as he claimed it was not part of Japanese culture.\n\nProp Paul Alo-Emile said: 'We play in clubs in New Zealand and Australia and we are from Samoa and we want to take photos and take as much of this home with us (as we can).'\n\nUruguay have Luis Suarez's favourite drink to thank for their World Cup upset.\n\nLos Teros beat Fiji in the pool stage, and are looking to give Australia a bloody nose on Saturday - and back Agustin Della Corte reckons it's all down to the traditional herbal teas.\n\n'When we are travelling we have a lot of leisure time, we like to share a mate,' he explained.\n\n'Each one of us brings our thermos and mate (mug) but the yerba mate (the actual herb) came with the team - we brought 200 kilos!'\n\nUruguay are taking inspiration from Luis Suarez and drinking his favourite drink\n\nJapanese fans have innovative ways of getting their autographs. Wales trained with 120 school kids in Otsu on Friday, and were watched by around 1,000 others - and in order to have their memorabilia signed some supporters dangled balls and shirts from pieces of string so the players could reach them!\n\nNamibia might be rated as having zero chance of beating the All Blacks - but they are hoping for a regal performance having picked the wonderfully named Prince Rivaldo Gino \u01c3Gaoseb in their side.\n\nThat exclamation mark is not a typo - it's in the flanker's full name!\n\nIf they do not win at least there might be some laughs from, ahem, Helarius Axasman Kisting their fly-half!", "description": "WORLD CUP DIARY: Australia will wear their away kit against Uruguay on Saturday - a green shirt inspired by the indigenous people of their country.
