the honour of a state funeral, dozens of dignitaries attended and lay floral wreaths on her grave in Karachi.\n\nDr Pfau\u2019s selfless devotion, in particular her work in Pakistan, is the reason that Google has chosen to celebrate her today.\n\nThe tech-giant often honours prominent personalities and marks world events by replacing its standard Google image with sketches it calls \u201cdoodles\u201d.\n\nToday\u2019s doodle depicts the nun, who was a medical doctor, in her element \u2013 treating a leprosy patient inside a Karachi clinic.\n\nThe disease, a bacterial infection is now curable, but has historically led to the ostracisation and stigmatisation of those who suffer from it.\n\nPakistan\u2019s \u201cMother Teresa\u201d was born Ruth Katharina Martha Pfau - the fourth of five daughters born to Walter and Martha Pfau in Leipzig, eastern Germany in 1929.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in

This unscheduled stopover ended up becoming the trigger for her life-long devotion to people in the Asian nation affected by leprosy.\n\nShe paid a \u201clife-changing visit\u201d to the Marie Adelaide Leprosy Clinic in 1958 where she saw, for the first time, the debilitating effects of the disease.\n\nThe patient who made her decide to stay in Pakistan was a leprosy patient similar in age to her.\n\n\"I was at this time not yet 30, and he crawled on hands and feet into this dispensary, acting as if this was quite normal, as if someone has to crawl there through that slime and dirt on hands and feet, like a dog,\u201d she told BBC reporter Mark Lobel in 2010.\n\nA couple of years after her first visit, Dr Pfau raised funds to refurbish the leprosy clinic.\n\nShe eventually built up a network of more than 150 modern medical centres in the country, including physiotherapy units, workshops to create artificial limbs and built homes for the handicapped.\n\nShe also started Pakistan\u2019s first Leprosy Technicians\u2019 course in 1965 whilst educating the public to combat the stigma that was associated with the skin condition.\n\nThanks, in large part to her efforts, the World Health Organisation deemed leprosy was under control in Pakistan in 1996.", "description": "A German nun who became known as Pakistan\u2019s own \u201cMother Teresa\u201d, for her life\u2019s dedication to fighting leprosy, is being honoured in a Google Doodle on what would have been her 90th birthday.
