He suggested he would seek action on that election bill Wednesday if Parliament approves legislation to delay Brexit by another three-months.\n\n\u201cParliament is on the brink of wrecking any deal we might be able to strike in Brussels,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBecause tomorrow\u2019s bill would hand control of the negotiations to the E.U. And that would mean more dither, more delay, more confusion.\u201d\n\nWhile denying that he wanted an election, the prime minister added, \u201cIf the House votes for this bill tomorrow, the public will have to choose who goes to Brussels on October 17 to sort this out.\u201d British and E.U. officials are scheduled to meet next on Oct. 17.\n\nJohnson was selected as leader of Britain in July through a vote involving only dues-paying members of his party. A general election \u2014 putting all seats in the House of Commons up for a vote \u2014 could either sink his government or give him a popular mandate for his promise to leave the E.U. by Halloween, \u201cdo or die.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister would need the support of two-thirds of Parliament to schedule an election, which could happen as soon as Oct. 14. It would be Britain\u2019s third general election in five years.\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party was prepared to fight an election, but he first wanted Parliament to pass the delay bill and ensure that Britain won\u2019t abruptly crash out of the E.U. in October without a deal to manage the withdrawal.\n\n\u201cTonight we defeated Boris Johnson in his first Commons test and tomorrow we will legislate against his disastrous No Deal plans,\u201d Corbyn tweeted.\n\nAnalysts say a so-called no-deal Brexit could be economically damaging and lead to food and medicine shortages. Johnson has dismissed those predictions as fearmongering.\n\n[How Boris Johnson\u2019s push toward a no-deal Brexit is playing out in the E.U.]\n\nJohnson lost Tuesday\u2019s procedural vote by 328 to 301. That capped a humiliating day for the prime minister, who was appearing before Parliament for only the second time since taking Britain\u2019s top job. He was heckled mercilessly as he defended his hard-line Brexit stand.\n\nHe noted that Tuesday was the 80th anniversary of Britain\u2019s entrance into World War II and said, \u201cThis country still stands then as now for democracy for the rule of law.\u201d He was met with jeers.\n\nHe insisted that Britain was making progress in talks with European Union leaders about an orderly Brexit, which drew more mocking laughter.\n\nAs Johnson spoke, Conservative lawmaker Phillip Lee dramatically crossed the chamber to defect to the Liberal Democrats, explaining in a statement that Johnson\u2019s party had become \u201cinfected with the twin diseases of populism and English nationalism.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s theatrical move stripped Johnson of his single-vote working majority in the House of Commons, making it all but impossible for him to enact legislation and increasing his incentive to ask the nation\u2019s voters for a mandate.\n\nIn a sign of the economic uncertainty caused by the political turmoil, the British pound dropped to its lowest level against the dollar in 35 years, apart from a brief plunge in 2016 likely for technical reasons. It regained the lost value by the end of the day Tuesday.\n\nCatherine Barnard, a professor of European law at the University of Cambridge, said in a less-fractious era, Johnson might find other parties willing to cooperate with him. But, \u201cat the moment, nothing is possible at all,\u201d she said.\n\nThe British leader has stoked anger with particularly hard-nose tactics. He secured the queen\u2019s approval to suspend Parliament for five weeks as the Brexit clock ticks down and warned rebellious lawmakers from his party that he would kick them out and forbid them from running as Conservatives in the next election.\n\nThose rebels in Tuesday\u2019s vote included party grandees Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond, both former chancellors, as well as Nicholas Soames, Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson. Johnson idolizes Churchill and wrote a fawning biography of him.\n\n[Britain\u2019s Johnson threatens to purge rebel party members as Brexit battle heats up]\n\nSoames told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight program that he was told he\u2019d have the whip removed on Wednesday morning, after serving 37 years in Parliament. \u201cThat\u2019s fortunes of war,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew what I was doing, but I just believe that they are not playing straight with us. To say you want a deal is quite different from saying you want a deal that is achievable.\u201d\n\nSitting next to him on the same program, Clarke, who became a Conservative member of Parliament in 1970, said that the Conservative Party under Johnson has become the \u201cBrexit Party rebadged.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe E.U. flags of anti-Brexit activists fly as pro-Brexit activists stand with their placards and demonstrate near the Houses of Parliament in central London on Sept. 3, 2019.

Stop the coup!\u201d\n\nMany wore yellow stickers that read \u201cBollocks to Brexit.\u201d There were also pro-Brexit signs that read, \u201cRemain MPs are the only obstacle to a good deal\u201d and \u201cTraitor Parliament.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrexit is a bad idea,\u201d said Roger Horne, a retired accountant from London. Outside of the bloc, \u201cBritain would have to go on bended knee to either President Trump or the remaining E.U. I think we have greater power, greater influence in the E.U.\u201d\n\nReferring to Johnson\u2019s threat expel Tories who don\u2019t back him, he said \u201cmaybe Johnson is trying to turn it [the party] into some kind of religious sect.\u201d\n\nVal Bateson, 77, a librarian, holding a large red \u201cVote Leave\u201d placard, said that \u201cParliament has been fiddling about for three years and not implementing this even though they promised to do so.\u201d\n\nWhen a group of pro-E.U. protesters marched by chanting \u201cThis is what democracy looks like!\u201d Bateson said muttered under her breath, \u201cYou didn\u2019t get a majority, mate.\u201d\n\nLaura Hughes in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nThe shadowy strategist behind Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit push\n\nCould Boris Johnson\u2019s \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit break up the United Kingdom?\n\nFormer British leader joins bid to derail shuttering of Parliament amid Brexit crisis\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Rebels from Johnson\u2019s own Conservative Party helped take control of the Parliamentary agenda.", "authors": ["Kevin Sullivan", "Senior Correspondent Covering National", "International Affairs", "Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/004zrPI06ZbQeiM2q2KGDMGB05k=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RQVU7LWOGEI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg"}
