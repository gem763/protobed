Whether it\u2019s enough to advance the once beleaguered franchise past the second round of the playoffs for the first time - let alone win an NBA championship - remains to be seen.\n\nBut clearly these guys are already having fun.\n\nThere was a fishing trip and a paintball outing - yep, Patrick Beverley was so competitive he splattered his own teammates - that made early impressions in a season the Clippers hope will be their most memorable yet.\n\n\u201cIf we maintain that, we\u2019re going to get through anything,\u201d George said Sunday at the team\u2019s media day.\n\nLeonard and George may be the biggest fish on the roster, but neither caught the largest when several of the Clippers took to the water. That honor belonged to a woman on the boat.\n\nAnd what happened to their fish shown off on social media?\n\n\u201cLike anybody else would do,\u201d Leonard replied. \u201cHave someone else fillet it, cook it, and eat it.\u201d\n\nBut he and George don\u2019t expect to do all the heavy lifting this season.\n\n\u201cEverybody on the same page,\u201d George said of the collective mindset, \u201cand we go out as one.\u201d\n\nLeonard led Toronto to its first NBA title last season, and he ticked off the characteristics of a championship team: high character, sacrifice and will to win.\n\n\u201cGo out there as one unit trying to accomplish that one goal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about enjoying the journey and not getting ahead of yourself. You also have to stay healthy as well.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming season already feels different to Leonard. He\u2019s past the right quad injury from 2017-18 that hastened his departure from San Antonio and subsequent trade to the Raptors.\n\n\u201cThis year I\u2019m feeling way better than I was at the start of last season,\u201d he said, adding there\u2019s no plan yet for his load management.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the Clippers will be without George for their season opener Oct. 22 against LeBron James and the Lakers. He\u2019s still rehabbing from offseason shoulder surgery that followed an injury-plagued ending to his time in Oklahoma City. George will be with the team at training camp in Hawaii starting Monday, but won\u2019t participate in contact.\n\nCoach Doc Rivers was at the team\u2019s practice facility Sunday, but he didn\u2019t speak to the media.\n\nOther things to know about the Clippers:\n\nDEFENSE\n\nLed by Beverley, the Clippers brought a ferocious attitude on defense last season.\n\nHis prediction with Leonard and George on the floor?\n\n\u201cThat scrappiness attitude, but on steroids,\u201d Beverley said.\n\nThat being said, Beverley is making it a goal to cut down on his technical fouls.\n\nCount Lou Williams as a skeptic.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a way to tell Pat Beverley to chill out,\u201d he said.\n\nCOMING HOME\n\nLeonard and George are both glad to be back home. Leonard is from Riverside and George is from the high desert city of Palmdale, located north of Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I\u2019m unpacking instead of packing at this time is a surreal moment,\u201d George said.\n\nLeonard has already reached out to local schools with a large-scale donation of backpacks. Despite his low-key reputation, Leonard wants to be visible in the community and \u201cfor them to see me, for them to shake my hand.\u201d\n\nTHE YOUNG GUYS\n\nLeonard and George have been generous in sharing their knowledge with the younger Clippers, including Landry Shamet and Jerome Robinson.\n\nEven with George sidelined early, he\u2019s still an influence.\n\n\u201cSometimes guys don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d Rodney McGruder said. \u201cIt\u2019s just their presence.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kawhi Leonard and Paul George have already passed the chemistry test with the Los Angeles Clippers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Beth Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/clippers_media_day_basketball_31939_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
