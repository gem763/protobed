This memo, which I published internally at Google and has been read by over 11,000 Google employees, states clearly why we must continue to fight this bias.\"\n\nGOOGLE TARGETED IN NEW ANTITRUST PROBE BY STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL\n\nGlasson added that employees who bring up pregnancy discrimination are often silenced or forced to suffer consequences that damage their careers in the long term.\n\n\"With a goal of shedding light on pregnancy discrimination and advocating for needed public policy and other changes, I will move forward with legal action,\" she writes.\n\nTwo Google employees who helped to organize the 20,000-strong global walkout also alleged that the tech giant retaliated against them -- a claim that the search giant has denied. The massive walkout was in response to issues of sexual harassment, as well as pay inequity and racial justice.\n\nFORTNITE STAR USES RACIAL SLUR, BUT TWITCH ISN'T COMMENTING ON IT\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News reached out to Google for comment on this story.", "description": "A Google employee whose memo alleging discrimination against pregnant women went viral is moving forward with her claim against the company.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/getty-images-not-ok-google.jpg"}
