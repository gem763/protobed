Pictured are Leo Varadkar and Boris Johnson as WAGs\n\nAfter exchanging small talk about their partners and Downing Street\u2019s new dog Dilyn, the pair kicked out their aides and did not reappear for 90 minutes.\n\nWhat they discussed remains a tightly guarded secret, but there has been a total change in the relationship between Mr Johnson and his Irish counterpart, compared to Mr Varadkar\u2019s tense and scratchy dealings with Theresa May.\n\n\u2018Boris finds Leo very impressive,\u2019 says a source close to the PM. \u2018They get on very well.\u2019\n\nThe talks lasted long enough for both peckish Downing Street staff and their Merrion Street counterparts to put aside three years of tense talks and eat their bosses\u2019 prepared lunch. They were putting away the smoked salmon and suitably European prosciutto sandwiches, pasta and a cheeseboard meant for the premiers when the two leaders called them back into the room for further talks.\n\nMr Varadkar broke the ice as he sat down with Boris Johnson in the wood-panelled reception room of 19th Century Thornton Manor on the Wirral. \u2018You know this is where Coleen Rooney had her birthday party,\u2019 he said. \u2018Well, we get on better than those two,' Mr Johnson quipped back\n\n\u2018It was instantly clear there had been a breakthrough,\u2019 a Downing Street aide said. \u2018We were hopeful that the moment Leo set foot in England we might have a chance, but their smiles took everyone back a bit.\u2019\n\nExtra lunch had to be ordered when the pair had finally finished further talks in the grounds of the manor, while aides hammered out a joint statement that neither side had expected to be so positive just hours earlier.\n\nBut in reality their meeting was the product of weeks of delicate diplomacy behind the scenes, even if pugnacious No 10 aide Dominic Cummings\u2019 briefings against the EU garnered the most public attention.\n\nWAGs at war: Rebekah Vardy (left) has threatened Coleen Rooney (right) with legal action over her allegations of leaking Instagram stories\n\nFollowing a row over the leaking of details of a call with between Mr Johnson and Mrs Merkel on Tuesday, followed by a vicious briefing against Mr Varadkar\u2019s intransigence on Wednesday, it looked like all hope of a deal was dead.\n\nA 30-minute phone call between Chancellor Sajid Javid and his Irish counterpart Paschal Donohoe helped soothe tempers, but defenders of Mr Cummings insist there was \u2018method to the madness\u2019 and the hardline stance helped to \u2018bring the Irish to our table\u2019.\n\nHowever two other key Downing Street figures have been singled out for making the Liverpool summit happen \u2013 Brexit negotiator David Frost and Chief of Staff Sir Edward Lister.\n\nA Downing Street insider said: \u2018There has been a lot of nonsense floating around for the last few weeks that we haven\u2019t been trying to get a deal.\n\n\u2018In reality Frosty has been working his b******s off in Brussels since August, and Eddie has diligently won over the Irish, flying back and forth to Dublin under the radar for weeks.\n\n\u2018Three months ago Varadkar was saying no talks, no changes, nothing. But there he was, negotiating with the Brits in Britain.\u2019", "description": "Leo Varadkar broke the ice as the pair sat down in Thornton Manor on the Wirral where Coleen Rooney had her birthday party.
