Saving For the Next Vacation Gets Upgraded With New Travel ETF\n\n(Bloomberg) -- You can soon save for your next vacation with an exchange-traded fund focused on the companies that will take you there.\n\nThe ETFMG Travel Tech ETF, ticker AWAY, will track the performance of a gauge of companies that provide technology for hotel reservations, ride sharing and travel advice, according to a regulatory filing. Booking (NASDAQ: ) Holdings Inc. and Uber Technologies (NYSE: ) Inc. are among its biggest components.\n\nThose stocks have outperformed the benchmark measure of U.S. equities this month, defying concern over an economic slowdown. That\u2019s been possible in part due to an upbeat outlook for travel tech companies\u2019 growth prospects among younger generations. Travel and tourism have contributed a record $8.8 trillion to the global economy last year, according to a council that represents more than 170 industry companies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a theme that investors are interested in,\u201d said Andy Wester, an analyst at Proficio Capital Partners. \u201cTravel can\u2019t really be disrupted, there\u2019s always going to be a business getting from point A to point B.\u201d\n\nThe travel tech fund is the latest offering from ETF Managers Group, which also runs the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF, with investments in cannabis-related companies. The new fund\u2019s management fee was not disclosed.", "description": "Saving For the Next Vacation Gets Upgraded With New Travel ETF", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE7G0MD_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
