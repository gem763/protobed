(Charles Rex Arbogast/AP)\n\nAll eyes were on Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers in Thursday night\u2019s NFL season-opening game in Chicago, as he made his debut in the offense of his new head coach, Matt LaFleur, after sitting out the entire preseason.\n\nThe unveiling of the Rodgers-and-LaFleur combination was less than dazzling. But on a night in which the football was far from elegant and both offenses seemed stuck in the preseason, the Green Bay defense stole the show and the Packers beat the Bears, 10-3, Thursday evening at Soldier Field.\n\n\u201cThat [Bears] defense is gonna give a lot of teams struggles,\u201d Rodgers said in an on-field postgame interview with NBC. \u201cThey\u2019re a very talented team. I had a couple real bad throws. We were off, out of sync at times. But we\u2019ve got a defense.\u201d\n\n[Best bets for NFL Week 1: Take the Chargers, Rams and 49ers]\n\nLaFleur is known for his ability to coach offense. He was hired by the Packers as part of the league-wide search for clones of Los Angeles Rams Coach Sean McVay, the youthful offensive mastermind who had his team in the Super Bowl last season. LaFleur coached with McVay with the Washington Redskins and for McVay for a season in L.A. He is charged in Green Bay with getting Rodgers back to a league-MVP level of play and with getting the Packers back into the postseason after two straight non-playoff seasons that led to predecessor Mike McCarthy\u2019s ouster.\n\nBut LaFleur is 1-0 as an NFL head coach not because of anything his offense and Rodgers did, but because he was wise enough to retain defensive coordinator Mike Pettine, the former head coach of the Cleveland Browns, from McCarthy\u2019s coaching staff. The Green Bay defense was superb Thursday night as the Bears scored only on a first-quarter field goal by their new kicker, Eddy Pineiro.\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d LaFleur said at his postgame news conference, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a lot of room from improvement from the offensive side of the ball. ... I can\u2019t tell you how proud I am, though, of the effort we gave and to come out of here with the victory.\u201d\n\nThe Bears won last season\u2019s NFC North title because then-rookie head coach, Matt Nagy, pushed along the development of young quarterback Mitch Trubisky and their defense was dominant following the preseason trade for pass rusher Khalil Mack. The Chicago defense looked every bit as overwhelming Thursday night, sacking Rodgers five times.\n\nBut Trubisky and the Bears could do next to nothing on offense.\n\n\u201cObviously unacceptable,\u201d Nagy said at his postgame news conference. \u201cIt starts with me. ... We\u2019re gonna fix it. Our guys know that.\u201d\n\n[How Kyler Murray went from a 5-foot-5 high school star to NFL\u2019s most anticipated QB]\n\nTrubisky threw an end-zone interception to Packers safety Adrian Amos, formerly of the Bears, with Chicago driving toward a possible tying touchdown and extra point with just less than two minutes remaining. The Bears got the ball back deep in their own territory with 1:33 to play but went nowhere.\n\nThe two teams combined for 17 punts, eight of them by the Bears. Trubisky was sacked five times and threw 45 passes, while the Bears had only 15 rushing attempts. Tarik Cohen had no carries, although he did have eight catches. The pass-heavy approach was not effective.\n\n\u201cThree points is ridiculous,\u201d Nagy said.\n\nRodgers threw a second-quarter touchdown to tight end Jimmy Graham in an 18-for-30, 203-yard passing performance. That four-play touchdown drive by the Packers in the second quarter came after they had minus-12 yards of total offense during a first quarter in which they had three possessions and didn\u2019t manage a first down. The offense never really got going. Kicker Mason Crosby provided a fourth-quarter field goal and the defense did the rest.\n\nThis kind of football is to be expected during an era in which NFL teams, more than ever, keep their front-line players safely on the sideline during the preseason. The first few regular season games become, in effect, the preseason that the starting players didn\u2019t have. Offense is about timing and precision, and offenses spend the early portion of the regular season catching up to defenses.\n\nRodgers was supposed to play two preseason games but was a late scratch from a game in Baltimore because of back tightness and was withheld, along with other Packers starters, from a game against the Oakland Raiders in Winnipeg because of safety concerns about field conditions.\n\nSo it shouldn\u2019t be overly alarming that Rodgers and the Packers struggled on offense Thursday, especially against a defense as good as Chicago\u2019s. Even with those offensive struggles, the Packers were able to send an opening-night message that their defense just might be good enough so that Rodgers doesn\u2019t have to do it all. He has help.\n\nLaFleur kept Pettine and the Packers, uncharacteristically, spent freely in free agency to bolster their defense. Thursday\u2019s early returns were promising.\n\n\u201cWe kept saying in the huddle, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s pick our defense up. Let\u2019s just get one drive together,\u2019 \u201d Rodgers told NBC. \u201cWe were backed up. We finally put together a drive, got a field goal out of it. But it didn\u2019t matter. Those guys, Mike Pettine and his staff \u2014 unbelievable job. It\u2019s fun to watch. That was an incredible performance. I\u2019m really happy for Matt, his first win as a head coach. We\u2019ll get better. It\u2019s a long season. That\u2019s a great defense and we\u2019ve got to get a lot better on offense. But I\u2019ll say it again: We\u2019ve got a defense.\u201d\n\nGame updates:\n\nTrubisky throws interception: The Bears finally got their offense going. But as they moved toward a possible tying touchdown and extra point, Trubisky threw an end zone interception to Amos, formerly of the Bears. The interception came on a third-and-10 play from the Green Bay 16-yard line. (Packers 10, Bears 3 with 1:58 left in the 4th quarter)\n\nPackers add field goal: The Packers stretched their lead to 10-3 with a 39-yard field goal by kicker Mason Crosby with a little more than five minutes remaining. LaFleur opted against a fourth-and-two gamble from the Chicago 21-yard line after a 10-yard scramble by Rodgers on third and 12. LaFleur put the game in the hands of the Green Bay defense, which has been terrific all night. (Packers 10, Bears 3 with 5:15 left in the 4th quarter)\n\nBad challenge by LaFleur: The NFL regular season\u2019s first interference-related instant replay challenge came by LaFleur, and it was a bad one. LaFleur challenged a non-call on a catch by Chicago\u2019s Taylor Gabriel, seeking to have offensive pass interference called for the lightest of push-offs. LaFleur lost his challenge, but no matter. Gabriel was called for offensive pass interference \u2014 for a far more blatant push-off, drawing a flag on the field and not requiring a replay review \u2014 to negate a 50-yard catch later on the drive. The Bears faced a first-and-40 predicament from their own 27-yard line after that penalty, and ended up punting. (Packers 7, Bears 3 with 11:48 remaining in the 4th quarter)\n\nFourth-down gamble fails for Bears: The Bears have done very little on offense, and the fans at Soldier Field have demonstrated their displeasure with occasional boos. Chicago had a good scoring chance late in the third quarter after quarterback Trubisky\u2019s 27-yard completion to running back David Montgomery produced a first down at the Green Bay 33-yard line. But the Bears\u2019 drive fizzled from there. They had their second delay-of-game penalty on the possession. Coach Matt Nagy left his offense on the field on fourth and 10 from the 33, opting against a 51-yard field goal attempt, but Trubisky\u2019s scramble came up seven yards short of a first down. The Packers take their 7-3 advantage into the fourth quarter in what has been a less-than-compelling night of football. (Packers 7, Bears 3 at end of third quarter)\n\nPackers squander third-quarter chance: Points are scarce tonight, and the Packers squandered a third-quarter opportunity to add to their 7-3 lead. A 38-yard pass interference penalty called on Chicago linebacker Roquan Smith (and not challenged by Nagy) gave the Packers a first down at the Chicago 35-yard line. On third and five from the 30, Rodgers scrambled for a first down, recovering his own fumble at the end of that run. But that first down was negated by a holding penalty called on the Packers. They were pushed back further by a third-down sack of Rodgers and ended up punting. (Packers 7, Bears 3 with 10:51 left in 3rd quarter)\n\nPackers lead at half: The Packers lead, 7-3, after a first half dominated by the defenses. Rodgers had a first-half passer rating of 101.5 for the Packers after connecting on 13 of 20 throws for 137 yards and a touchdown. But Green Bay did little on offense other than a four-play drive at the beginning of the second quarter resulting in Rodgers\u2019s touchdown pass to tight end Jimmy Graham. The Bears, however, did even less against Green Bay\u2019s defense. The Bears managed only 98 yards of total offense in the half and scored only on a first-quarter field goal by Pineiro. LaFleur, perhaps sensing that it\u2019s shaping up as a defense-first night, went the conservative route late in the first half. The Packers left their offense on the field on a fourth-and-four play from the Chicago 46-yard line about a minute before halftime, but never snapped the ball and ended up punting. LaFleur\u2019s decision to retain Pettine as Green Bay\u2019s defensive coordinator is looking good so far. There were a few boos from the Soldier Field crowd directed at the Chicago offense very late in the first half. (Packers 7, Bears 3 at halftime)\n\nRodgers-to-Graham TD puts Packers in front: The Packers offense suddenly sprung to life in the second quarter. After totaling minus-12 yards on three first-quarter possessions, the Packers suddenly went 74 yards on four plays in 1 minute 35 seconds, and scored a touchdown. Rodgers had completions on all four plays. He connected with wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling for 47 yards to get the drive going, and he found Graham with an eight-yard lob for the score. Now it\u2019s Chicago\u2019s turn to get something going on offense. (Packers 7, Bears 3 with 13:08 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\nPackers have minus-12 first-quarter yards: The Green Bay offense had its preseason in the first quarter, apparently. The opening quarter of the NFL regular season is done, and the Packers managed minus-12 yards of total offense. Green Bay had the ball three times, and went three plays and out and punted all three times. Rodgers was sacked twice. Yes, the Chicago defense is good. But is it really that good? Rodgers said during the week that the fact he didn\u2019t play at all during the preseason would not be the reason that the Packers struggled on offense in the opener, if they struggled. There\u2019s room to wonder at this point. (Bears 3, Packers 0 at end of 1st quarter)\n\nBears actually make a field goal: The Bears\u2019 kicking misadventures ended their 2018 season courtesy of Cody Parkey\u2019s \u201cdouble-doink\u201d miss against the Philadelphia Eagles in the opening round of the NFC playoffs, and their search for a reliable kicker was the biggest story of their offseason. Parkey\u2019s replacement, Pineiro, thrilled the crowd at Soldier Field by connecting on a 38-yard field goal to give the Bears a 3-0 lead late in the first quarter. The celebration was somewhat short-lived, as Pineiro sent the ensuing kickoff out of bounds. The Packers need to get something going on offense. Before Pineiro\u2019s field goal, Green Bay went three plays on offense and out and punted for the second straight possession. The Chicago defense is dominating so far. (Bears 3, Packers 0 with 4:09 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nSlow start on offense for Green Bay: Everyone was waiting to see how Rodgers would fare in LaFleur\u2019s offense. One possession into the regular season, the answer is: not so great. The Packers, after receiving the opening kickoff, went three plays and out against Chicago\u2019s celebrated defense and punted. Rodgers was sacked on third down on a play on which the Packers also were called for holding. The Bears crossed midfield on their opening drive but also punted. (Packers 0, Bears 0 with 9:39 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nPostgame reading\n\nThe NFL season begins Thursday night with a traditional rivalry \u2014 and the debut of quarterback Aaron Rodgers in the offense of the Green Bay Packers\u2019 first-year head coach, Matt LaFleur.\n\nThe Packers face the Bears at Soldier Field in Chicago after the NFL decided, as part of its 100th anniversary celebration, to make the latest edition of this rivalry the season-opening matchup instead of having the reigning Super Bowl champion, in this case the New England Patriots, host the Thursday night lid-lifter.\n\nThis game will be particularly intriguing because Rodgers, after sitting out the entire preseason, will be playing in LaFleur\u2019s offense for the first time.\n\n\u201cIf we go out and we struggle, it has nothing to do with playing meaningless reps in the preseason,\u201d Rodgers said when he met with reporters this week. \u201cI really believe that. You\u2019re not facing a ton of gamelike situations in the preseason. If we go out and light it up, it\u2019s not because we rested in the preseason. Our performance will be based on our preparation this week, our experience and the way we execute on the field. And the same for them. \u2026 It\u2019s about execution in an intense environment, first game of the year. We\u2019ll be ready to play and we hope we can execute against a really good defense.\u201d\n\n[Aaron Rodgers can do it all. If the Packers got their offseason right, he might not have to.]\n\nRodgers had been scheduled to play two preseason games but missed one in Baltimore because of back tightness and another against the Oakland Raiders in Winnipeg because of safety concerns about the field conditions. But he said that his practice-field work in LaFleur\u2019s offensive system should not be dismissed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not nothing,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cYou\u2019re going against your own defense at full speed every day in practice. The game speed is obviously a step above practice speed. But it wouldn\u2019t matter who you\u2019re playing. It\u2019s the National Football League. It\u2019s a fast game and things happen quickly. You have to rely on your training, your experience in these situations. Again, most of those [Bears] guys haven\u2019t played a lot in the preseason, either. It\u2019s gonna be both teams trying to get accustomed to the speed of the offense and the defense, and who can adjust quickest and make the least amount of mistakes.\u201d\n\nRodgers said this will be only the \u201cfirst iteration of our offense\u201d and vowed that there will be growth as the season progresses. LaFleur was hired as part of the trend of teams hiring young, offensive-minded head coaches in the mold of Los Angeles Rams Coach Sean McVay. In LaFleur\u2019s case, he worked alongside McVay with the Washington Redskins and under McVay for a season in Los Angeles. LaFleur will try to get the Packers back into the playoffs after two straight misses, which led to Mike McCarthy\u2019s ouster.\n\nLaFleur can only hope to duplicate the year one success enjoyed last season by Bears Coach Matt Nagy. Nagy pushed along the development of quarterback Mitch Trubisky, and the Bears, after adding standout pass rusher Khalil Mack in a trade with the Raiders, rode the league\u2019s third-ranked defense to win the NFC North. That came even after a season-opening loss at Green Bay in which Rodgers returned from a first-half knee injury to lead the Packers back from a 20-0 deficit.\n\nThe Bears\u2019 season ended with an exasperating first-round playoff defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles in which kicker Cody Parkey missed a would-be winning field goal when the football clanked off both an upright and the crossbar. Parkey is gone, and the Bears hope that Eddy Pineiro takes a positive first step Thursday toward ending their kicking misadventures.\n\nRodgers said he expects a captivating season-opening show.\n\n\u201cThis is the National Football League,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cThere\u2019s great players on both sides. We\u2019ll both be ready to play and I expect the product to be good.\u201d\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nThe artifacts that defined the NFL\u2019s first 100 years\n\nCowboys didn\u2019t play hardball with Ezekiel Elliott.
