But, per the case report, the patient did not complete the injection course.\n\nHe developed hearing loss, likely due to decreased bone density in the inner ear and later developed blindness from nerve damage.\n\nThe patient was then \"prescribed the appropriate nutritional supplements and referred to mental health services for his restricted eating\" the case report described, adding that while his vision stabilized it did not improve.\n\n\"This patient likely suffers from ARFID, or Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, which is becoming a more recognized disorder, in which patients restrict their intake typically based on textural, color, or taste aversions to foods,\" Parekh explained. \"ARFID differs from anorexia in that it is not driven by body image or weight concerns. ARFID can be recognized in children with other sensory processing disorders and autism.\"\n\nMany afflicted with ARFID have less severe consequences, but not eating a varied diet may increase those risks.", "description": "The Bristol Medical School released a new case in which a teen who was a fussy eater resulted in health issues including blindness and hearing loss.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/white-bread-stock-gty-jef-190903_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
