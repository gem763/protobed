She travelled from around 350 to 400 yards on the wrong side of the road. It was a head on collision. We later lost him in hospital\".\n\nHarry's dad, Tim Dunn added: \"She was compliant with the police, she admitted at the time she was in the wrong. We know from the police she was going to stay in the country, she was permitted to stay here for three years.\n\n\"And then we didn't think this would be what is happening so to hear the news a few weeks after the funeral was devastating\".\n\n(Image: Universal News (Europe))\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\nAs we reported earlier, police chiefs have written to the US embassy in London to demand immunity is waived.\n\nNick Adderley, chief constable for Northamptonshire Police, said US authorities had been appealed to in \"the strongest terms\" to apply a waiver and \"allow the justice process to take place\".\n\nNorthamptonshire Police is leading investigations into the collision that killed teen Harry from Banbury.\n\nOfficers said the woman allegedly involved in the accident had left the UK, despite telling officers she did not plan to do so.\n\nThe US embassy confirmed the incident had involved a vehicle driven by the spouse of a US diplomat assigned to UK who had departed the country, adding that diplomatic immunity was \"rarely waived\".\n\n(Image: Justice4Harry)\n\nResponding to a question on Twitter on Sunday, Mr Adderley confirmed that he and Stephen Mold, Police Fire and Crime Commissioner for Northamptonshire, had contacted the embassy for immunity to be waived.\n\nSpeaking to ITV News, Mr Dunn's parents said they had been \"trapped in a living nightmare\" since their son's death.\n\nMum Ms Charles said they were prepared to travel to the US to seek a resolution to their situation.\n\nShe told ITV News: \"We're not going to be swept under the carpet.\n\n\"Harry always fought for what he believed in... we're going to carry on that.\"\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\nShe added: \"We'll go as far as we need to go, to get justice for our boy and to do our best to stop another family suffering\".\n\nThe teenager's father Mr Dunn said: \"We can't let our son die and then nothing be answered for.\"\n\nUnder Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, families of diplomats are granted immunity from arrest or detention, with the sending state able to issue a waiver of that immunity.\n\nAccording to the Crown Prosecution Service, the immunity does not apply to dependants of consular officials based outside of London.\n\nHowever, it is understood that some diplomatic staff and their spouses located outside the capital can get that immunity.\n\nRadd Seiger, a spokesman for Mr Dunn's family, said British authorities had asked their US counterparts for immunity to be waived \"several times\".\n\n(Image: Justice4Harry)\n\nHe said: \"They've been told the answer is no, we've learnt via the police.
