All claimed anonymous sources are anti-Kavanaugh while all but a tiny few on-record sources are downright effusive. Just interesting how highly they contradict each other. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nInteresting.\n\nThat\u2019s a good word for it.\n\nJust read anonymous anecdote \u2014 written in high dudgeon \u2014 that Kavanaugh once hit a \u201cpickup truck with his hands\u201d during night out at college with his friends. It made @Heminator and me laugh. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nSo basically, Kavanaugh was a normal college guy.\n\nWho knew?\n\nI\u2019m now reading about how a woman raised in Connecticut WHO WENT TO YALE lacked privilege. I get the authors are super-elites but uh \u2026.this rural Colorado girl who went to a state school on her own dime would like a word. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nTHAT POOR GIRL, SHE HAD TO GO TO YALE.\n\nAt least thus far, Ramirez doesn\u2019t accuse Kavanaugh of anything tangible. Same as original New Yorker in which nothing was actually alleged. Just carefully suggested. Yet in NYT today, authors alleged penis thrusting. Curious what basis for charge is. Important to focus on facts. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nFacts? What are these facts Mollie is speaking of here? The NYT wouldn\u2019t know a fact if one fell out of the sky, landed on their faces, and started to wiggle.\n\nSupporting evidence for this nothing story with no witnesses despite taking place, supposedly, at a large public event? Literally nothing. But she did tell mom, allegedly, years later, and I quote: \u201csomething happened at Yale.\u201d \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nWell, in that case, impeach the guy right now.\n\n*eye roll*\n\nThe authors of the \u201cinvestigation\u201d \u201creport\u201d that leftist Congresswoman Anna Eshoo found no partisan agenda in leftist accuser Blasey Ford. (her attorney later admitted on video she was motivated by her support of abortion) \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nHA HA HA HA HA HA\n\nThe timing on this \u2026 wow.\n\nI\u2019m actually kind of enjoying how bad this is \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nWe are too.\n\nThey are trying to say she is apolitical and even a former Republican (her friends reported she was \u201ccrazy liberal\u201d on social media prior to a professional scrub last year) \u2026 before admitting she literally took part in a pussy hat March. I\u2019m not exaggerating. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nFormer Republican. Next, they\u2019ll tell us she\u2019s a gun-rights activist who voted for Trump.\n\nFirst interesting news in the book? Facebook COO Sheryl Sandburg was helping Blasey Ford. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nThat figures.\n\nI haven\u2019t really complained about lack of corporate media coverage of our exhaustively reported and researched book. In part because it\u2019s a huge bestseller, so it seems wrong. But comparing it to the coverage of this (*shockingly* weak) book is making me want to complain. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nThe book notes, quietly, that the woman Max Stier named as having been supposedly victimized by Kavanaugh and friends denies any memory of the alleged event. Seems, I don\u2019t know, significant. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 15, 2019\n\nIt completely nukes the whole story.\n\nShocker.\n\nMy take on the NYT new Kavanaugh \u201cstoryline\u201d \u2014> Renewed need to discredit Trump SCOTUS appointees = RBG must be at risk of retirement pre-election 2020. The thought of another SCOTUS appointment terrifies libs. \u2014 Rudy (@USAfree123) September 15, 2019\n\nThe Left\u2019s new motto really should be, \u2018If at first you don\u2019t succeed, fail and fail again.\u2019\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2018Nonsensical hearsay\u2019: Matt Whitlock\u2019s refresher thread on why Ramirez/ Kavanaugh story COMPLETELY fell apart a must-read\n\n\u2018Some people made some ad\u2019: Ilhan Omar demands ABC apologize to AOC for anti-Socialism ad and it goes so wrong\n\n\u2018He got EXACTLY what he needed\u2019: Doctor contradicts Warren\u2019s claim \u2018nobody likes their health insurance company\u2019", "description": "And Mollie would know.", "authors": ["Sam Janney", "Posted At Am On September", "Sam J."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/epic-fail_new.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
