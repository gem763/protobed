A roadshow is the name for the series of meetings that startups have with potential investors immediately before a public offering.\n\nWeWork representatives did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Representatives for SoftBank, which is the biggest investor in the commercial-real-estate company, also did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nWeWork made its IPO paperwork public last month and, according to Bloomberg, had been trying to debut on the markets by the end of this month.\n\nBut the company saw significant pushback from investors, who were reportedly concerned about its valuation, business model, governance, and potential resilience in a recession. Last week, the company was considering going public with a market capitalization of as little as $10 billion, less than a quarter the $47 billion valuation SoftBank conferred on it as part of an investment in January.\n\nRead more: Why WeWork's $47 billion private valuation could be a key stumbling block for its IPO \u2014 and might even derail it completely\n\nWeWork's struggles to go public have reverberated back on SoftBank. Two of the biggest backers of the Japanese conglomerate's $100 billion Vision Fund are considering taking much smaller stakes in its planned follow-on fund, Bloomberg reported.\n\nGot a tip about SoftBank or WeWork?
