Their chronicle of the Corleone crime family remain to this day cinema classics.\n\nIn 1972 The Godfather was the highest grossing film of the year, earning nearly \u20ac122.6 million that year according to Box Office Mojo, which tracks box office movie revenues.\n\nThe film was so successful, it is still listed among the highest grossing films of all time.\n\nBut Paramount Pictures, the studio which bought the rights to the Godfather, took issue with Coppola\u2019s casting of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.\n\n\u201cI was told that having Brando in the film would make it less commercial than having a total unknown,\u201d Coppola said.\n\nThe studio insisted the two actors do numerous screen tests. Studio executives also thought Pacino was too short and wanted his role recast with Robert Redford or Ryan O\u2019Neal.\n\nCoppola himself was nearly fired by the studio.\n\nPacino told audience members, he had originally wanted the role of Vito Corleone\u2019s hot-headed son, Sonny, rather than the role of Michael who eventually develops into a ruthless crime boss.\n\n\u201cSo I thought, OK, let me just think about this for a second, and I flash on the book,\u201d said Pacino when Coppola cast him. \u201cRight away I\u2019m thinking as an actor does, you know, I thought, gee it\u2019s not a good role. It\u2019s Sonny the role I can play.\u201d\n\nDiane Keaton, who plays Michael Corleone\u2019s wife in the films said she hadn\u2019t seen the films in several decades, and took to the casts\u2019 reunion to compliment Coppola on his film.\n\nShe said the films were astonishing.\n\n\u201cFrancis, it was so beautiful,\u201d Keaton said. \u201cEverybody is so great in it, and the music is so \u2013 every choice you made was so authentically brilliant. I mean that. It\u2019s so unusual.\u201d", "description": "The director and cast of _The Godfather_ reunited in New York to mark the 45th anniversary of the iconic 1970's Oscar-winning mafia movie.", "authors": ["Pierre Bertrand"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/365679/1000x563_365679.jpg", "published_at": "2017-05-01"}
