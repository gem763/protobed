Life on earth is dying. We are living in the midst of the 6th mass extinction.\n\n\u201cGlobal warming causes major damage to the global economy and the natural world and engenders risks of catastrophic and irreversible outcomes.\u201d\n\nOther signatories include actors Ray Winstone, Jude Law and Steeve Coogan, as well as Spice Girl Mel B and comedian Ruby Wax.\n\nThe letter concludes with the celebrities saying they have been inspired by young climate campaigners, including Greta Thunberg, to speak out.\n\n\u201cAlongside these people who are already paying the price for our fossil fuelled economy, there are millions of children \u2013 called to action by Greta Thunberg \u2013 who are begging us, the people with power and influence, to stand up and fight for their already devastated future,\u201d the letter reads.\n\n\u201cWe cannot ignore their call. Even if by answering them we put ourselves in your firing line.\u201d\n\nThe comments come after several celebrities were criticised for supporting XR despite landing lucrative car sponsorship deals and holidaying on private jets.\n\nEarlier this year, Dame Emma Thompson was criticised after flying 5,400 miles from Los Angeles to London before taking part in an XR protest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to do my job without occasionally flying, although I do fly a lot less than I did,\u201d Dame Emma told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\n\nSimilarly, Sherlock star Cumberbatch was recently announced as the new ambassador for Indian car brand MG.\n\nLast week, he joined XR protesters sitting in the road to block traffic from entering Trafalgar Square.\n\nThe celebrity letter was released on the 10th day of XR protests in central London, which have targeted some of the busiest sites in the capital.\n\nOn Thursday morning, XR protesters were pulled from the top of trains by angry commuters as they targeted London\u2019s Tube network.\n\nParts of the Jubilee Line were shut down after a number of the climate activists climbed on to a train at Canning Town station. British Transport Police said there were two additional incidents at Stratford and Shadwell.", "description": "Celebrity supporters of Extinction Rebellion (XR) have called themselves \u201chypocrites\u201d for supporting environmental protests while living \u201chigh carbon lives\u201d.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/17/11/celebs-xr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
