It means nothing wasted or even recycled, while saving water that would usually be used to wash up too.\n\nThe capsules are available at bar Tay\u0113r + Elementary on London\u2019s trendy Old Street area. The bar has created three cocktails showcasing the Founders\u2019 Reserve whisky, which bypass glasses, ice and stirrers.\n\nPatrons can pop the 23ml capsule directly into their mouths, press it against their cheek and bite to release the measure. The sensation is said to be similar to that of popping a cherry tomato.\n\nThe Glenlivet is the first spirits brand in the world to team up with sustainable packaging start-up Notpla. The seaweed used grows at a speed of around a metre each day and contributes to de-acidifying oceans, said the brand.\n\nHowever, the design has come in for ridicule on social media, with many comparing the \u201cflavour explosion experience\u201d of The Glenlivet\u2019s cocktails to the Tide Pod Challenge, which swept social media in early 2018. The stunt dared people \u2013 usually teenagers \u2013 to record themselves attempting to eat a washing detergent capsule, resulting in a host of hospital admissions.\n\nMeanwhile, others derided the pods suggesting that given the opportunity, many drinkers would attempt to ingest the cocktails via orifices other than their mouths.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s for the best, in that case, that the limited edition range is only available until 13 October.", "description": "It means nothing wasted or even recycled, while saving water that would usually be used to wash up too.", "authors": ["Rachel Graham"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/49/26/1000x563_cmsv2_1c7cd3f8-3422-5961-9383-1944e0b8c9a2-4214926.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
