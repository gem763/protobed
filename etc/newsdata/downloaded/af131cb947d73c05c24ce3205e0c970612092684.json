(USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAll of this makes it easy to dismiss any notion the Steelers might be moving on from their future Hall of Fame quarterback. But we know the NFL is a cutthroat league, and there\u2019s a long history of teams separating from aging legends the moment a better option presents itself. Even Joe Montana, the former G.O.A.T. quarterback, got traded, while Peyton Manning, who has a statue in front of the Colts\u2019 stadium, was released before he was ready.\n\nThe 37-year-old Roethlisberger has seen enough in his 16 NFL seasons to understand this dynamic. But while Montana and Manning had their spots usurped by younger, former No. 1 overall picks in Steve Young and Andrew Luck, the man filling in for Roethlisberger is a second-year pro who was taken in the third round last year and has thrown only 19 career passes, all of which came in the second half of a home loss to Seattle in Week 2.\n\nStory continues\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free. Here\u2019s how.]\n\nThe best descriptor for Rudolph\u2019s play \u2014 12 of 19 passes for 112 yards, two touchdowns and an interception \u2014 this past Sunday: functional. He showed poise, often sliding or shifting away from pressure, especially on one of his touchdown throws to Vance McDonald. And he also has a knack for play-action, as his other touchdown came after faking a handoff with gusto to draw the linebackers in before delivering a strike behind them on a slant.\n\nYet, Rudolph\u2019s accuracy was also off a few times, including on some deeper throws. Whether it was because of ball placement or miscommunication with receivers, it must be more consistent. What\u2019s more, Rudolph also had a two-point conversion intercepted outright when he failed to spot a lurking safety under duress. In time, Rudolph should learn to see the field better \u2014 he\u2019ll need to if he wants to replace a legend as soon as next season.\n\nThe good news for Pittsburgh is that barring an injury, it shouldn\u2019t take long to get a good read on Rudolph\u2019s upside. He has an experienced o-line in front of him and a stud running back to hand off to, and while the receiving corps has been underwhelming, No. 1 target JuJu Smith-Schuster is sensational. Besides, like the great Bill Parcells once said, if a dog\u2019s got bite in this league, they\u2019ll bite as a pup.\n\nNow to be clear, nothing we saw from Rudolph on Sunday suggests a Patrick Mahomes-like revelation is coming. But the NFL remains the ultimate performance league, and if the Steelers rallied from their 0-2 start and refashion themselves as a run-first unit that capitalizes on Rudolph\u2019s strengths \u2014 which are selling play-action plays, something rarely used under Roethlisberger, and pushing it downfield \u2014 it\u2019s fair to wonder whether they\u2019d make a change at QB1 in 2020.\n\nOutside the Steelers doing the unlikely \u2014 since 1990 only 12 percent of 0-2 teams have rallied to make the playoffs \u2014 under Rudolph\u2019s stewardship, there\u2019s plenty of reason to believe Roethlisberger\u2019s job is safe.\n\nNot only would he cost $28 million in dead salary-cap money to release, the Steelers\u2019 recent decision to deal their 2020 first-rounder to Miami for versatile safety Minkah Fitzpatrick means they won\u2019t have the ammo to draft a premium long-term replacement for Roethlisberger next season in the event Rudolph turns out to be merely serviceable.\n\nSo in a weird way, while the trade was clearly a bet on Rudolph, it was also one on Big Ben, leaving him as an insurance policy of sorts \u2014 not that most in Pittsburgh would ever describe it that way.\n\nRoethlisberger is a legend in western Pennsylvania, someone who has a history of embracing challenges and proving people wrong. He has stated he wants to play out his contract, which runs on for two more seasons after this one, but to do it, the onus is on him to come back better than he was this year, as the Steelers\u2019 passing game stunk through the six quarters he played.\n\nYet, if NFL history is any indication, it will also require Rudolph \u2014 who just turned 24 this year \u2014 to prove incapable of being anything more than a solid starter during his 14-game audition. And no amount of preemptive strikes can change that.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "It's easy to dismiss any notion that the Steelers might be moving on from their future Hall of Fame QB.
