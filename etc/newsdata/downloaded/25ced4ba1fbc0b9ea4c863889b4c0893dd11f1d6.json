Today is an up day on a favorable tweet.\u201d\n\nMinutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s September meeting showed most policymakers supported last month\u2019s interest rate cut, and while all were generally more concerned with risks associated with the U.S.-China trade war and slowing global growth among other geopolitical issues, they differed on what that meant for the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cThere was some dissent in the vote, but everyone\u2019s together on the concept of monetary policy setting being data dependent,\u201d said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta. \u201cAnd recent data, particularly from the manufacturing sector, would continue to imply there\u2019s a good probability of a rate reduction at the October meeting.\u201d\n\nA man walks through the rain on Wall St. outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 9, 2019.
