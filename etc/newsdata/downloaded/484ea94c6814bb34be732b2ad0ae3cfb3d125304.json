Its former Kurdish allies immediately forged a new alliance with Assad\u2019s government, inviting the army into towns across the breadth of their territory.\n\nA Reuters cameraman on the Turkish frontier reported heavy bombardment on Tuesday morning of the Syrian border town of Ras al Ain where an SDF spokesman reported a fierce battle going on.\n\nU.S. military aircraft carried out a \u201cshow of force\u201d in Syria after Turkish-backed fighters came in close proximity to American forces during the Turkish offensive, a U.S. official told Reuters.\n\nThe official said U.S. military aircraft were flown over the area after troops in northeastern Syria felt the Turkish-backed fighters were too close. The Turkish-backed fighters dispersed after the show of force, the official said.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence will meet Erdogan on Thursday in Ankara, where he will urge Turkey to reach an immediate ceasefire in Syria and to work towards a negotiated settlement. Erdogan said he told Trump he will never declare a ceasefire in northern Syria.\n\n\u201cVice President Pence will reiterate President Trump\u2019s commitment to maintain punishing economic sanctions on Turkey until a resolution is reached,\u201d the White House said in a statement.\n\nAfter Trump announced a set of sanctions on Monday to punish Ankara, U.S. prosecutors hit Turkey with charges on the majority state-owned Halkbank [HALKB.IS] for taking part in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nA Turkish embassy official in Washington said the indictment did not contribute positively to the current state of U.S.-Turkey ties. Turkish and American officials had been in talks on the Halkbank case for at least a year.\n\nMORE U.S. SANCTIONS PRESSURE\n\nA senior Trump administration official said Washington would threaten more sanctions to persuade Turkey to reach a ceasefire and halt its offensive.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, a loyal Trump supporter who has nevertheless been highly critical of the president\u2019s troop withdrawal, said he would introduce on Thursday a bill to impose tougher sanctions on Turkey.\n\nThe measures announced on Monday - mainly a hike in steel tariffs and a pause in trade talks - were less robust than financial markets had anticipated, and Trump\u2019s critics derided them as too feeble to have an impact.\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian rebel fighters raise the Syrian opposition flag at the border town of Tel Abyad, Syria, October 14, 2019. REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi\n\nThe Turkish lira, which had fallen on the expectation of tougher U.S. measures, recovered after the sanctions were announced, as did its bond and stock markets, with traders noting that Trump had spared Turkish banks.\n\nBilateral trade between Turkey and the United States is relatively small - around a tenth the size of Turkey\u2019s trade with Europe. Washington\u2019s most effective form of economic leverage would be to hinder Turkey\u2019s access to U.S. financial markets, a step Trump has so far avoided.\n\nIn a potentially more damaging blow, German carmaker Volkswagen said it was postponing a final decision on whether to build a 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) plant in Turkey, citing concern over \u201ccurrent developments\u201d after international condemnation of the incursion.\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s announcement, the U.S. Treasury said on Monday it had sanctioned Turkey\u2019s energy, defence and interior ministers.\n\nACCUSATIONS OF BETRAYAL\n\nTrump has defended his reversal of U.S. policy as part of a plan to extricate the United States from \u201cendless\u201d wars in the Middle East.\n\nBut his critics cast it as a betrayal of the Kurds, loyal allies who lost thousands of fighters as the principal ground forces in Washington\u2019s battle against Islamic State.\n\nThe Kurdish YPG militia, the key component of the forces who fought Islamic State, is seen by Ankara as a terrorist group aligned with Kurdish separatist insurgents in Turkey.\n\nTurkey says it aims to defeat the YPG and create a \u201csafe zone\u201d where millions of Syrian war refugees now in Turkey could be resettled.\n\nThe United Nations says 160,000 people have fled their homes as Turkish forces advance. The regional Kurdish administration puts the number of displaced at 270,000.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council will likely meet on Wednesday to discuss the latest developments in Syria, diplomats said, the second such session since Turkey began its offensive.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nThe U.N. Human Rights office said on Tuesday that Turkey could be held responsible for war crimes by fighters under its direction, potentially including the assassination of Hevrin Khalaf, a leading Kurdish politician killed on the side of a highway on Saturday by gunmen who posted the incident on the internet.\n\nTurkish-backed fighters have denied blame for her murder.\n\nErdogan, who has pledged to continue military operations come what may, said Ankara was giving the world a chance to bring peace to the region.\n\n\u201cThe international community missed its opportunity to prevent the Syrian crisis from pulling an entire region into a maelstrom of instability,\u201d he wrote in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe European Union - and the world - should support what Turkey is trying to do.\u201d", "description": "Turkey pressed ahead with its offensive in northern Syria on Tuesday despite U.S. sanctions and growing calls for it to stop, while Syria's Russia-backed army moved on the key city of Manbij that was abandoned by U.S. forces.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441200790&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1JC", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
