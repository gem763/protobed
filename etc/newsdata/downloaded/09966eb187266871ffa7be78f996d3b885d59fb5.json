(VENN)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 In a bid to combine the huge market for video games with the booming medium of television, a pair of entertainment veterans are launching a network they say can merge the worlds in profitable ways.\n\nVENN, as the channel will be called, will offer esports and other gaming content on both digital and linear-television platforms. Launching in 2020, the venture has attracted investment from gaming fund Bitkraft and a range of industry personalities from Twitch, Blizzard Entertainment and Riot Games.\n\nThe network is a gamble that gaming needs the home, and production values, that old-school television provides.\n\n\u201cWe believe we are addressing an asymmetric opportunity,\u201d Ben Kusin, the entrepreneur who is co-founding the company with esports producer Ariel Horn, said in an interview. \u201cThis is a $150 billion industry but no 24-7 network to support it.\u201d\n\nGaming has become an entertainment juggernaut. The research firm Newzoo estimates sales will exceed $152 billion this year, with more than 2.5 billion gamers globally. Fortnite, the hugely popular online game, has more than 250 million accounts, according to creator Epic Games.\n\nVENN \u2014 which stands for Video Game Entertainment & News Network \u2014 will look to capitalize on this interest using a traditional television lens.\n\nEsports is the realm in which millions of people tune in to watch gamers play, either from their bedrooms or in more formal competitions. YouTube and the Amazon-owned streaming platform Twitch are among the space\u2019s dominant players. By working with producers and hosts, the VENN founders say they can give the industry a larger and more respectable mainstream platform and turn a profit besides.\n\n\u201cWe want to elevate and promote a culture that\u2019s been overlooked by traditional media,\u201d Horn said in the interview with Kusin. (Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.)\n\nThe entrepreneur, who once served as an executive at Vivendi Games, is the son of Gary Kusin, who founded the retailer GameStop. Horn has won Emmys for his esports productions.\n\nKusin didn\u2019t offer details on distribution for the network but said streaming and linear platforms were both on tap. Horn said it was too early to announce a programming slate or talent partnerships.\n\nThe pair did give general guidelines for its shows.\n\nAbout 50 percent of the content will be streamed competition, the partners said, including more polished forms of the competitions now available on the likes of YouTube. The other half will include gaming-related content in talk, magazine and other unscripted formats, with the potential for more high-end scripted content down the line.\n\nRevenue will come from subscriptions, cable operators and advertisers, and brand sponsors, the principals said. The company is building studio space in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nKusin said that despite the linear component of traditional cable operators, the network will \u201cprovide a hedge\u201d by seeking to live on various digital platforms, including potential competitors such as YouTube and Twitch themselves.\n\n\n\nVENN founders Ben Kusin, left, and Ariel Horn. (VENN)\n\nKusin and Horn hope to capitalize on a cult of personality that has sprung up around some esports athletes. \u201cGamers are celebrities \u2014 for a younger audience, meeting gamers is as exciting as meeting rock stars of traditional sports heroes,\u201d Horn said.\n\nLast month, when popular streamer Ninja switched his streaming home from Twitch to Microsoft\u2019s Mixer, it for a time made the app the third-most-popular on Apple, ahead of YouTube and Instagram.\n\nVENN has raised $17 million in financing from, among others, Bitkraft, Riot co-founder Marc Merrill, Blizzard executives Mike and Amy Morhaime and Kevin Lin, co-founder of Twitch, as well as BDMI, the venture arm of media giant Bertelsmann.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the landscape today, Twitch and YouTube offer highly talented players who often produce out of their living room,\u201d Bitkraft founding partner Jens Hilgers said in an interview. \u201cWhile it\u2019s super-authentic, it could benefit from climbing up the ladder.\u201d\n\nHilgers and other investors also noted that VENN would play an important role in talent discovery and information-gathering.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re someone interested in knowing what\u2019s happening in gaming this weekend, you have to do a lot of research. You have to know where it\u2019s happening; you have to know the niche sites to go to,\u201d said Merrill of Riot, which is behind the popular League of Legends franchise and its related competitions. \u201cIt will be great to have a place that does it all.\u201d Merrill said that Riot is not involved with VENN.\n\nInvestors also said a television network can now capitalize on many of gaming\u2019s interactive elements.\n\n\u201cThis opportunity interested us because we think it can go well beyond traditional television,\u201d said Keith Titan, a partner at Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments. \u201cYou can have interactivity and engage directly with fans \u2014 you can make it a two-way viewing experience,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cGaming culture is all about those personal connections, especially for millennials and Gen Z.\u201d Many of the shows will have a live component in which fans and gaming celebrities can interact, Horn said.\n\nPrincipals say VENN could resemble early MTV in its ability to leverage television to bring a youth culture to the mainstream \u2014 and leverage youth culture into television profits.\n\n\u201cThink of what TRL was like when it started,\u201d Kusin said, referring to \u201cTotal Request: Live,\u201d MTV\u2019s long-running and zeitgeist-defining pop-music show. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do here.\u201d\n\nMTV also used music as a tool to go far beyond music into politics and social issues, waters Kusin and Horn said they\u2019ve yet to test.\n\nVENN follows in the path of G4, a gaming-centric network that found a niche audience in the mid-2000s before changing its format. That network, VENN founders say, came about before the rise of esports, a crucial difference.\n\nStill, whether all this will be enough to take a medium that exists, almost by design, outside of legacy media remains unclear. The idea that many video-game fans crave more high-end production or traditional TV packaging remains untested.\n\nAlso an open question is whether a nongaming television audience will embrace the network, an obstacle even some investors admitted could be difficult to scale.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a false hope we can grow the audience that way,\u201d Hilgers said. \u201d I wish it could have that effect, but from the evidence I\u2019ve collected in the last years, I\u2019m just not banking on it.\u201d\n\nMerrill acknowledged the idea was less about being in the black right away and more about boosting the gaming community.\n\n\u201cI would say [immediate profit] is not the purpose of the investment,\u201d he said. \u201cMy primary motivation is to help elevate the culture of gaming.\u201d", "description": "Can old-school television and modern videogames be profitably combined?", "authors": ["Steven Zeitchik", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Entertainment In The U.S.", "September At Am", "Steven Zeitchik Covers The Business Of Entertainment For The Washington Post", "Examining The Industry'S Trends", "Challenges", "Issues", "Ideas.
