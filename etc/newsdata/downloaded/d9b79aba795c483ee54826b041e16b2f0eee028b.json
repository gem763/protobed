He couldn\u2019t. It looked like he was trying to grip a hot brick. He reached, grimaced and recoiled. The ball fell from the bench to the ground, and Brees walked away, defeated, staring at a thumb injury that spoiled the biggest game of this young NFL season.\n\nSadly, the repercussions could be much greater than having to watch the anticipated rematch of the NFC championship game turn into a sleepy, 27-9 Los Angeles Rams\u2019 victory. After the game Sunday, Brees exited Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum saying he was \u201cconcerned\u201d and intent on seeing a hand specialist immediately. Over the course of his 19 NFL seasons and record 74,845 passing yards, Brees hasn\u2019t been concerned about much more than the next play.\n\nSince becoming a starter in 2002, Brees has played in 265 of a possible 274 regular season games. He has missed just one game because of injury. Now, at age 40, he fears an extended absence after banging his throwing hand against the hand of Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald. And he is not the only aching signal caller.\n\nPittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger left the Steelers\u2019 28-26 loss to Seattle complaining of discomfort in his right elbow. He is concerned and seeking an MRI exam to determine the severity of his injury. That makes two Super Bowl-winning, Hall of Fame-bound quarterbacks in limbo. And just a week ago, Jacksonville\u2019s Nick Foles, another champion, suffered a broken collarbone.\n\n[Sean Payton is moving the Saints past the NFC championship game no-call, but he hasn\u2019t forgotten]\n\nA year ago, we delighted in a season of offensive innovation and sterling quarterback play, one that saw 17 players throw for at least 3,700 yards and nine throw for at least 30 touchdowns. From the emergence of Patrick Mahomes to the resilience of Andrew Luck to the persistence of Tom Brady, it was a fantastic year to witness quarterbacks of all ages and styles showcase their talent and diversify the game. Now, just two weeks into 2019, three significant starters are down, and there are indications all over the league that QB injuries could put a damper on this season.\n\nLuck retired at the end of the preseason, announcing that he was tired of the constant pain and rehabilitation. In additions to the injuries of Brees, Roethlisberger and Foles, two of the league\u2019s most promising young quarterbacks \u2014 Deshaun Watson and Carson Wentz \u2014 have been pummeled in prime-time games and managed to play through the hits. And then there is Cam Newton, the former MVP coming off shoulder surgery and looking physically diminished at age 30.\n\nBeyond the major instances of quarterback thwacking, there are many teams with questionable offensive line situations barely surviving from down to down against the league\u2019s athletic and swift defensive linemen. Even New England, which has outscored its opponents 76-3 in its first two games, is working hard to keep Brady clean and mitigate injury issues on the offensive line.\n\nThere is concern everywhere. Despite adjusting rules and going to extraordinary lengths to try to keep quarterbacks healthy, the NFL cannot guarantee such safety. Sometimes, collarbones break after a hard landing. Sometimes, defensive linemen get close enough to make thumbs bend awkwardly. Sometimes, twinges are felt in elbows. And when too much of that happens at the game\u2019s most important position, seasons can be ruined, and power throughout the league can shift.\n\nThe Saints may be the best team in the NFC, but they aren\u2019t if Brees is out for a while. New Orleans trusts it has one of the league\u2019s best backups in Teddy Bridgewater, and the franchise is paying him $7.25 million to be an admirable fill-in. He wasn\u2019t that effective against the Rams \u2014 just 165 passing yards on 30 attempts \u2014 but he was thrown into action late in the first quarter. If he starts Sunday at Seattle, it will be a more accurate indicator of what he can do in Sean Payton\u2019s offense.\n\nThe Steelers, who have had one losing season this century, must recover from an 0-2 start with uncertainty surrounding the 37-year-old Roethlisberger, who led the NFL last season with 5,129 passing yards. Before Foles went down, the Jaguars thought he was the key to their bid to return to the postseason after a disappointing 2018 campaign. But now the Jaguars are also 0-2, and even though rookie backup quarterback Gardner Minshew is a cool story and a quality young playmaker, it\u2019s doubtful Jacksonville will be much of a threat without Foles, who is likely out another two months.\n\n[How the Saints-Rams no-call changed the NFL]\n\nThis injured quarterback trio represents the classic, pocket passer faction, but when you look deeper into the position and concerns about long-term health, there\u2019s another issue to consider. As NFL teams attempt to modernize their offenses, as they buy into creative systems and the need to allow athletic quarterbacks the freedom to change the game, an old worry is creeping into relevance: How do you keep them safe and out of the training room?\n\nIt\u2019s not as easy as coaching a quarterback to be smart and learn to slide. It\u2019s not as easy as limiting his designed runs. Spread offenses and other college-style systems force NFL coaches to reimagine traditional offensive line protections. The mobility of these quarterbacks make it harder to keep a clean pocket because the QB isn\u2019t always standing in the preferred spot. Signal callers who can extend plays tend to hold onto the football longer than they should, which almost guarantees taking more hits. For a franchise, it\u2019s a dangerous feeling, but on the other end of risk, there are big plays and points and energized fan bases. Can you really tell Russell Wilson, who somehow hasn\u2019t missed a game in eight seasons, not to be Houdini? Do you really want Mahomes not to improvise and throw that 60-yard touchdown pass? Do you really think the Houston Texans, now that they\u2019re benefiting from Watson\u2019s electricity, want to force him to be vanilla?\n\nThere\u2019s a fine line between responsible and reckless with these special talents. There\u2019s a fine like between ambitious and cautious. Personally, I think we\u2019re moving closer to an era in which teams won\u2019t be able to expect their franchise quarterback to provide 15 years of stability. Newton might not play that long; as much as he loves the game, I think he is closer to following Luck into early retirement than rediscovering his MVP form. Watson, who has already had torn ACLs in both knees, isn\u2019t on pace to play until his late 30s. Wentz, who shows mesmerizing ability when healthy, has been unavailable for the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 last two playoff runs.\n\nOf course, the Eagles still found a way to give Wentz a monster four-year, $128 million contract extension in June, which featured $66 million fully guaranteed at signing. Going all in on Wentz also meant saying goodbye to Foles, who was the ultimate insurance policy. It was the right move and the logical one despite Wentz\u2019s injury history, but it means the franchise winces every time its quarterback takes a big hit and prays that he rises.\n\nIt\u2019s too reactionary to suggest such quarterback trepidation will become the NFL norm soon, but the position is changing. And the acceptance of that change is greater than it has ever been. The NFL is teeming with intriguing possibilities, but there\u2019s ample risk, too. And that\u2019s just the nature of football.\n\nOh, well. At least the current, durable legends will play forever without . . . never mind.\n\nEnjoy these enduring quarterbacks as long as you can. Don\u2019t take them for granted. Their longevity is far more delicate than you realize.", "description": "Injuries to veterans Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger are the latest to put a damper on this season.", "authors": ["Jerry Brewer", "Sports Columnist", "September At Am", "Jerry Brewer Is A Sports Columnist At The Washington Post.
