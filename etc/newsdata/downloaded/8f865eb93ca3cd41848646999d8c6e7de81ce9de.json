REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker\n\nThe world\u2019s largest planemaker, plunged into a fresh crisis over the safety of the banned 737 MAX after Reuters reported the messages on Friday, also said it was investigating the \u201ccircumstances of this exchange\u201d and regretted the difficulties that the release of messages presented for the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe FAA on Friday ordered Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg to give an \u201cimmediate\u201d explanation for the delay in turning over the \u201cconcerning\u201d document, which Boeing discovered some months ago.\n\nIn the messages from November 2016, then-chief technical pilot Mark Forkner tells a colleague the so-called MCAS anti-stall system - the same one linked to deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia - was \u201crunning rampant\u201d in a flight simulator session.\n\nAt another point he says: \u201cI basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly).\u201d\n\nThe messages prompted a new call in Congress for Boeing to shake up its management as it scrambles to rebuild trust and lift an eight-month safety ban of its fastest-selling plane.\n\n\u201cWe understand entirely the scrutiny this matter is receiving, and are committed to working with investigative authorities and the U.S. Congress as they continue their investigations,\u201d Boeing said in its statement on Sunday.\n\nThe instant messages prompted harsh reactions from several Democratic lawmakers in Washington, with Representative Peter DeFazio saying, \u201cThis is no isolated incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe outrageous instant message chain between two Boeing employees\u201d suggests \u201cBoeing withheld damning information from the FAA,\u201d DeFazio, who chairs the U.S. House Transportation Committee, said on Friday.\n\nBoeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, who was stripped of his chairman title by the company\u2019s board nine days ago, is set to testify before the committee on Oct. 30.\n\nDeFazio\u2019s committee also obtained details of a 2016 Boeing survey that found nearly 40% of 523 employees handling safety certification work perceived \u201cpotential undue pressure\u201d from managers, such as bullying or coercion.\n\nOther top concerns include \u201cschedule pressure\u201d and \u201chigh workload,\u201d though 90% of the employees said they were comfortable raising concerns about \u201cundue pressure\u201d to management, according to a copy of the Boeing presentation of the survey results seen by Reuters on Sunday.\n\nThe presentation was obtained by the committee\u2019s investigators and not among a trove of documents handed over the committee by Boeing itself, a person briefed on the matter said.\n\nEvidence of \u201cundue pressure\u201d was also pinpointed by a group of international regulators reviewing the 737 MAX certification.\n\nBOARD MEETING\n\nBoeing\u2019s statement was released as its board of directors and top executives from its airplanes division and supply chain gathered in San Antonio, Texas for previously scheduled meetings on Sunday and Monday.\n\nThe board meetings come as pressure mounts on Chicago-based company not only from the regulatory and criminal investigations stemming from the crashes but also from the financial burden caused by the jet\u2019s safety ban and continued high production.\n\nSeveral industry sources said there was speculation inside the company of significant job cuts as Boeing, unable to deliver 737 MAX planes to customers, continues to experience a cash drain. The 737 production rate may also have to come down if regulators further delay the MAX\u2019s return to service, the people said.\n\nAfter business hours on Thursday, Boeing turned over the instant messages to the FAA after having them for months. Boeing had turned them over to the Justice Department in February - before the crash of a second 737 MAX in Ethiopia in March, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday.\n\nA second person briefed on the matter said that Boeing CEO Muilenburg told FAA Administrator Steve Dickson during a 25-minute phone call on Friday that the company did not believe it could turn the messages over initially because of the Justice Department probe, an argument Dickson rejected citing safety issues.\n\nOn Sunday, Boeing said it has not been able to speak to Forkner directly about his understanding of the document.\n\n\u201cHe has stated through his attorney that his comments reflected a reaction to a simulator program that was not functioning properly and that was still undergoing testing,\u201d Boeing said.\n\nReuters also reported on Friday that Forkner was grappling with a number of software problems with the flight simulator itself, according to a former Boeing test pilot who analyzed the transcript and who had direct knowledge of the flight simulator at the time.", "description": "Boeing Co said on Sunday that it regrets and understands concerns raised by the release of a former Boeing test pilot's internal instant messages noting erratic software behavior two years before deadly crashes of its 737 MAX jet.", "authors": ["Eric M.
