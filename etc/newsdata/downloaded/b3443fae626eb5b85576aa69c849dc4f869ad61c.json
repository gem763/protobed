They said they would only agree to an election once Johnson had ruled out leaving the European Union without a deal.\n\nBritain faces an Oct. 31 deadline to leave the EU, but after three years of political crisis, with parliament unable to agree on a strategy, it remains unclear when, if or on what terms the country will leave the bloc it joined in 1973.\n\n\u201cThis Parliament must either stand aside and let this government get Brexit done or bring a vote of confidence and finally face the day of reckoning with the voters,\u201d Johnson said, adding he would not \u201cbetray the people\u201d over Brexit.\n\nCorbyn and opposition parties have already forced through a new law requiring the government to ask for a delay to Brexit if it fails to secure a deal by Oct. 19, but it remains unclear whether the prime minister would abide by it.\n\nJohnson, often compared to U.S. President Donald Trump in his approach to governing, said he would not request an extension even if the conditions of the law were met, but also said he would obey the rules and deliver Brexit by Oct. 31.\n\nCorbyn said no one could trust the prime minister, telling him: \u201cIf you want an election, get an extension.\u201d\n\nA Labour source said the party would not take up the prime minister\u2019s offer of a no confidence vote on Thursday \u201cwhile there\u2019s the threat of Johnson using it to ram through a no deal before polling day\u201d.\n\nFIRST DAY BACK\n\nJohnson was appearing in parliament for the first time since the Supreme Court ruled he had acted unlawfully in advising Queen Elizabeth to suspend parliament.\n\nHaving lost his majority and a series of parliamentary votes on Brexit, Johnson had suspended the House of Commons for five weeks. But the country\u2019s top court ruled the closure was void in one of the most humiliating legal defeats for a prime minister.\n\nParliament remains in deadlock, with Johnson intent on leading Britain out of the EU with or without an exit agreement while most lawmakers are determined to block a no-deal scenario, fearing it will cause huge economic disruption.\n\nHis demands for an election have already been rejected twice.\n\nRunning out of options and with an eye on an election campaign, Johnson sought on Wednesday to paint his opponents as not just opposed to a no-deal Brexit, but opposed to Brexit altogether: defying the will of the British people.\n\nJohnson\u2019s spokesman said the opposition\u2019s refusal to trigger an election would be taken by the government as a green light to carry on with its Brexit strategy, to leave by Oct. 31. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put up or shut up,\u201d he said.\n\nBritain's Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn speaks at the parliament, which reconvenes after the UK Supreme Court ruled that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suspension of the parliament was unlawful, in London, Britain, September 25, 2019, in this screen grab taken from video.

Many invoked the memory of their colleague Jo Cox who was murdered just before the vote.\n\nAfter one lawmaker Paula Sherriff told the House she had received death threats, with many echoing the prime minister\u2019s own words, Johnson replied: \u201cI have never heard so much humbug in my life\u201d, sparking uproar on the opposition benches.\n\nAhead of Johnson\u2019s appearance before lawmakers, his attorney-general, Geoffrey Cox, described the British parliament as \u201cdead\u201d. In a defiant outburst he labeled the government\u2019s opponents as cowards for refusing to call an election.\n\nUnder questioning, he said the government would comply with the new law forcing the delay if no deal was struck.\n\nWith Johnson boxed in, he has repeatedly said he can strike a deal with the EU\u2019s 27 other members at a summit on Oct. 17-18.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nHowever, EU negotiators say he has made no new proposals capable of breaking the deadlock over the issue of how to manage the border between Ireland, an EU member, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, after Brexit.\n\n\u201cI think the people of this country have had enough,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis parliament must either stand aside and let this government get Brexit done or bring a vote of confidence and finally face the day of reckoning with the voters.\u201d", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson taunted his rivals on his return to parliament on Wednesday, goading them to either bring down the government or get out of the way to allow him to deliver Brexit.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433868189&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1X0", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
