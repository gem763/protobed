The temperature there was 25.1C before the snow - and exactly the same afterwards.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Organisers say it helps the audience feel refreshed - and amused\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption It's one of many strategies to keep the Games cool\n\nTakashi Okamura, head of communication, command and control on the organising committee, told the BBC the result was \"not as expected\", but said the snow had other merits.\n\n\"The advantage of this machine is having a spray device to help the audience feel refreshed - and the amusement factor.\"\n\nSnow, misting machines and umbrella hats\n\nThe machines, which have previously been used at music festivals, make snow by crushing ice and mixing it with air, and can cover an area of 15m in windy conditions. Their cost has not been disclosed.\n\nThe organising committee has not firmly decided to use the artificial snow and said more tests would follow - including a second on Friday.\n\n\"Today is just a first trial,\" said Tomoaki Matsumoto, an official in the committee's venue services department. \"But it is possible for us to use it.\"\n\nOlympic chiefs have been developing cooling strategies since Tokyo was awarded the Games in 2013, trying everything from misting machines at stadiums to extravagant umbrella-shaped hats.\n\nRecent summers have done little to allay fears of a boiling 2020 Games.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Japan declared last year's heatwave a natural disaster\n\nIn 2018, the government declared a natural disaster after at least 65 people suffered heat-related deaths in a week, while July 2019 saw more than 5,000 people seek hospital treatment during a searing heatwave.\n\nLast month, the International Triathlon Union shortened the running leg of an Olympic qualifier in Tokyo as temperatures reached 32C (90F), declaring that conditions had reached an \"extreme level\".\n\nOlympic officials initially appealed to Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to adopt daylight saving time so endurance events could take place at the coolest time of day.\n\nAnd while the clocks won't be going forward, the marathon races will start earlier than usual at 06:00 in a bid to beat the heat.\n\nParalympics concerns\n\nTechnology is playing its part too. Roads on the 26-mile (42 km) route have been coated in a heat-shielding material that reflects infrared rays, lowering their surface temperature by up to 8C.\n\nThe move is especially important for Paralympic athletes who use wheelchairs in outdoor events, as the design of such wheelchairs puts them very close to the ground. That can raise competitors' body temperatures by an additional 2-3C compared to someone standing.\n\nIn other measures, trees are being allowed to grow as much as possible to provide shade for spectators lining the roads, and buildings with air conditioning have been asked to throw their doors open to weary fans.\n\nOrganisers may also break with tradition to let spectators bring their own bottled drinks into the Games venues - something banned at previous Olympics due to issues around sponsorship and security.\n\nThe 2020 Summer Olympics will run from 24 July to 9 August, with the Paralympics scheduled from 25 August to 6 September.\n\nBefore that, though, Japan will welcome an estimated 400,000 overseas visitors for the Rugby World Cup. While Tokyo will host the 20 September opening ceremony, the battle for rugby's ultimate prize will unfold in 12 stadiums around Japan - bringing a boost for regional tourism.", "description": "Japan tests spraying fake snow in 'Snokyo' to tackle the summer heat ahead of the games next summer.", "authors": ["Rebecca Seales", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07n6z6x.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
