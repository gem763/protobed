Nevertheless, he learned of the online chatter - and criticism - over his Game 1 absence.\n\nThe team placed him on paternity leave so that he could be there when little Millie, the couple's third child, was born in Scottsdale, Arizona on Friday morning. And on Saturday, Hudson said he had no regrets.\n\nNationals relief pitcher Daniel Hudson throws against the St. Louis Cardinals during game two of the 2019 NLCS playoff baseball series - a day after the birth of his daughter\n\nHudson (44) celebrates with right fielder Adam Eaton after defeating the St. Louis Cardinals in game two of the 2019 NLCS playoff baseball series at Busch Stadium\n\n'I went from not having a job on March 21 to this huge national conversation on family values going into the playoffs,' Hudson told reporters after the Nationals defeated the St. Louis Cardinals to take a 2-0 lead in the NLCS.\n\n'Life comes at you fast, man. I don't know how that happened and how I became the face for whatever conversation was going on. Everybody's got their opinions, man, and I really value my family and my family time.'\n\nHudson missed Washington's win Friday at St. Louis and pitched 2/3 of an inning Saturday afternoon to earn the save in the best-of-7 NLCS.\n\nA number of people on Twitter were quick to criticize the baseball player for missing the game\n\nOthers were quick to defend his actions on social media\n\nThe 32-year-old closer said the Nationals were supportive and placed him on the paternity list.\n\nUnder league rules, he could be away from the team for one-to-three days and still retain his playoff eligibility.\n\nHe made a whirlwind trip from Arizona to St. Louis to limit him to just one missed game.\n\n'I knew I was going to go no matter what,' Hudson said. 'I didn't know that this was a new thing, to have a playoff paternity leave list. I had no idea. I was like, \"I can't be the only person to have a baby in the middle of the postseason.\" And for it to blow up like it did, man, it's kind of crazy. But I didn't really give much thought about not going. My family is top priority for me.'\n\nDaniel Hudson poses with his wife Sara in a photo from 2018.

If all is well, he needs to get to St. Louis. Inexcusable. Will it matter?'\n\nOther were quick to dispute that a single game was more important than a life-changing moment.\n\n'So, you're saying his wife should be able to handle childbirth, alone, without her husband there, but his team of 40 guys can't handle one playoff baseball game? In 2019, this is really what you're saying? Some lady must be lucky to have you!,' a Twitter user wrote in response.\n\nHudson posted a 3-0 record with six saves, a 1.44 ERA and 0.88 WHIP in 24 appearances with Washington.\n\nHe also made 45 appearances with Toronto earlier in the season, sporting a 6-3 mark with two saves, a 3.00 ERA and 1.27 WHIP.", "description": "Washington Nationals star Daniel Hudson was in a hospital room in Arizona when his team beat the St. Louis Cardinals 2-0 in the first game of the series.
