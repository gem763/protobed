Lee Zeldin (New York) tore into House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff and Democrats spearheading the impeachment process. During an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u2018This Week,\u2019 Zeldin accused Schiff of creating a \u201cfairytale\u201d and attempting to get Americans \u201cdrunk on his favorite cocktail,\u201d which be broke down into three ingredients.\n\nAdam Schiff is trying to get the US drunk on his favorite cocktail: There are three main ingredients: (1) Cherry-picking leaks, (2) withholding key facts, and (3) outright lying. I discussed this AM on @ThisWeekABC w @jonkarl pic.twitter.com/3A0OmgQapS \u2014 Lee Zeldin (@RepLeeZeldin) October 13, 2019\n\nThis was after Zeldin told host Jon Karl that Joe and Hunter Biden should not be immune from scrutiny over his Ukrainian dealings simply because the elder Biden is running for president.\n\nI don't believe Burisma, Joe Biden, Zlochevsky, or Hunter Biden should be immune from scrutiny just bc Joe Biden is running for POTUS. Pres Trump & many others (myself included!) have a huge problem w/the Biden's shady arrangement in Ukraine.@ThisWeekABC @jonkarl pic.twitter.com/NX9bRWZLx1 \u2014 Lee Zeldin (@RepLeeZeldin) October 13, 2019\n\nWith no relevant experience, Hunter got paid 50k+ p/month by corrupt foreigners, solely bc he was the VP's son. VP Biden threatened Ukraine w/the loss of $1B if the state prosecutor wasn\u2019t immediately fired, who btw, had an open case into Burisma/Zlochevsky. Those are ALL facts! \u2014 Lee Zeldin (@RepLeeZeldin) October 13, 2019\n\nNO ONE in the Obama admin was more conflicted out to run point w/ Ukraine than Joe Biden. Maybe the US needs to change laws to make sure this never happens again in the future. If that Biden family scheme in Ukraine w/Burisma & Zlochevsky wasn\u2019t illegal, then it should\u2019ve been. \u2014 Lee Zeldin (@RepLeeZeldin) October 13, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, Schiff was on CBS\u2019 \u2018Face the Nation,\u2019 where he basically admitted that there was no quid pro quo between President Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nDid Adam Schiff Just Admit There Was No Quid Pro Quo?\n\nhttps://t.co/524etf1Qby \u2014 PJ Media (@PJMedia_com) October 13, 2019\n\nAs pointed out by PJ Media, this undermines the narrative Schiff and other Dems have been trying to create.\n\nFor weeks now, we\u2019ve been told that the transcript was evidence of a quid pro quo, and now Adam Schiff is saying \u201cthere doesn\u2019t need to be a quid pro quo.\u201c\n\nAdam Schiff: \"First, there doesn't need to be a quid pro quo\u2026\" What??? \u2014 Kerry Picket (@KerryPicket) October 13, 2019\n\n***\n\nRELATED:\n\n\u2018LOL. Media looks to be triggered\u2019: Kimberley Strassel mocks media for pushing another Russian-style hoax (Ukraine) and it\u2019s PERFECT\n\nUH OH: Joe Biden\u2019s Ukraine question dodging is even starting to bother some on CNN", "description": "Rep.
