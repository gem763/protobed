Police arrived 15 minutes.\n\nBut by that time, the fight had ended. One woman had to be wheeled out on a stretcher after suffering a cut on her head.\n\nThe robot continued on its way, rolling along the concrete path that slices through the park.\n\n\u2018Please keep the park clean,\u2019 the robot says when pausing periodically to tell park visitors.\n\nCosme Lozano, the chief of police in Huntington Park, said the alert button had not yet been connected to the police department.\n\nInstead, any emergency calls are directed to Knightscope, the company that made the robot and leases it to police departments.\n\nCosme Lozano, the chief of police in Huntington Park, said there are still technical kinks to be ironed out as the department works to incorporate the new technology\n\n\u2018That\u2019s why we\u2019re not advertising those features,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a new program for us and were still developing some protocols\u2026 to be able to fully adopt the program.\u2019\n\nDescribed as an 'autonomous data machine', HP RoboCop was unveiled in June.\n\nBilled as a machine that \u2018keeps a watchful eye on the public,\u2019 it is equipped with 360-degree video cameras, which are then able to relay video footage to human police.\n\nIn addition to a two-way intercom and the ability to track cell phone use nearby, it is also said to be able to scan 1,200 license plates in a minute.\n\nIt beams this data to police headquarters in order to facilitate fast and safe responses from police officers.\n\nThey were created by Silicon Valley company Knightscope and are being used in select cities around the US at venues including malls, hospitals, stadiums and warehouses, according to the company's website.\n\nMore than 70 of these machines have been manufactured by the company so far.\n\nKnightscope says the combination of self-driving technology, robotics, and artificial intelligence make them \u2018crime-fighting autonomous data machines.\u2019\n\nBut it appears it will take time before the machines are ready for duty.\n\nLozano said the robots are on \u2018a trial basis for the city\u2019 and that the police force is still working to incorporate the technology.\n\nHuntington Park pays Knightscope between $60,000-$70,000 a year to lease the robot, according to Lozano.", "description": "A woman was taken to the hospital after suffering a cut to the head during an altercation in Huntington Park, just south of downtown Los Angeles.
