Since he became top dog last year, Morrison has accused \u201cgender whisperers\u201d of influencing vulnerable children who question their identity, chucked a stink about gender-inclusive toilets in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and chastised Cricket Australia for new guidelines regarding trans players at the grassroots level.\n\nThe argument here is that kind of public stance contributes to a culture which sees transgender Australians as second-class citizens, which is what actually contributes to negative mental health outcomes among the community.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2017, suicide was the leading cause of death for Australians aged between 15 and 44, with transgender individuals disproportionately impacted by the issue.\n\nFor his part, Morrison \u2013 who has pledged hundreds of millions of dollars towards lowering the youth suicide rate, including $52m for Headspace \u2013 told the SMH Australia\u2019s suicide rate was too high among people facing the \u201cpressures of identity politics.\u201d\n\nAddressing the factors which contribute to alienation and vilification of our most vulnerable communities will go a long way to alleviating the burden, and cultural touchstones have begun to celebrate trans Australians like Stone.\n\nBut a spot on Neighbours only goes so far, and Stone said it\u2019s essential adults and figures like Morrison to make young people feel comfortable discussing their mental health.\n\nHelp is available.\n\nIf you require immediate assistance, please call 000.\n\nIf you are in distress, please call Lifeline on 13 11 44 or chat online.\n\nHave something on your mind?
