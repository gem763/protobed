The show ended with a display of rainbow-themed garments, as in a huge belted rainbow coat in metallic lame, with giant balloon sleeves.\n\nAs always, Siriano did not hold back on the glam factor, with long ruffled trains, billowing sleeves and sequins on dresses, skirts and pants, and even a sprinkling of angel wings.\n\nBefore the show, Siriano spoke to the inclusivity of his runway.\n\n\u201cI have customers from all walks of life, and I think that\u2019s what I try to do in this collection,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have something for everyone in a way.\u201d He said his focus was still on glamorous eveningwear - his bread and butter, after all - but added that he also wanted to throw in some \u201cgreat pieces for someone that wants to go out to dinner.\u201d\n\nHis front row was packed as usual with famous faces, including \u201890s actresses like Sarah Michelle Gellar, Lucy Liu and Alicia Silverstone.\n\nThe \u201890s, he said, was \u201ckind of like my coming of age,\u201d a time when he learned about fashion and style. \u201cI\u2019d rather have every actress and musician in my front row that anyone else,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Fashion lovers argue that it's not only a business but also a true art, and Christian Siriano made that argument in a literal way on Saturday by bringing an actual artist to his runway, putting the finishing touches on her paintings as models strutted by.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jill Dobson", "Jocelyn Noveck"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/fashion_christian_siriano_29761_c0-241-5760-3599_s1770x1032.jpg?5744a6e428d626295d3fe14d6d300f488e16a9a8", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
