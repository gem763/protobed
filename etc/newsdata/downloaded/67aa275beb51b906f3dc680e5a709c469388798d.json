(AP Photo/Eric Christian Smith)\n\nWith 28 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds in a 126-123 win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday, Russell Westbrook carved out yet another piece of triple-double history.\n\nThe Houston Rockets point guard posted his 139th career triple-double against the Pelicans, moving him past Magic Johnson into sole possession of second place on the NBA\u2019s all-time triple-double list. Only Oscar Robertson, the patron saint of triple-doubles, lies ahead.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNaturally, Johnson logged onto Twitter yet again to congratulate Westbrook on the achievement.\n\nCongratulations to Russell Westbrook for passing me and having the 2nd-most triple-doubles in NBA history! https://t.co/y3KgYXsjJB \u2014 Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) October 27, 2019\n\nWestbrook and James Harden combined for nearly half of the Rockets\u2019 126 points with 57, continuing a trend for the Rockets that figures to define their season. Less good for the team is the pair combined to go 17-of-46 from the field and 3-of-21 from 3-point range (16 of those deep misses belonged to Harden).\n\nWill Russell Westbrook catch Oscar Robertson?\n\nStory continues\n\nThe obvious question now is if Westbrook will eventually reach Robertson. The answer to that could be a legitimate toss-up.\n\nOn the pro side for Westbrook capturing the record, there\u2019s the fact that not even Robertson can match the pace Westbrook has been on since Kevin Durant left the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2016. Westbrook has already broken Robertson\u2019s records for most triple-doubles in a season with 42, most consecutive triple-doubles with 10 and most seasons averaging a triple-double with three straight.\n\nIf Westbrook continues his pace of 33.7 triple-doubles over the past three seasons, he should be on track to catch Robertson by the end of next season.\n\nHowever, time is not exactly on Westbrook\u2019s side, even with that pace. For starters, Westbrook is less than a month from turning 31 years old and is known for a physical style of play, so you never know when a drop-off might happen.\n\nWestbrook also has a disadvantage in the race because of his new team\u2019s pace of play. The point guard moved from a team that was sixth in the NBA in pace last season to No. 27. Of course, Westbrook had a hand in setting that pace and could do the same with the Rockets, so that\u2019s yet another repercussion of the Harden vs. Westbrook debate for who should control the steering wheel on offense.\n\nEssentially, it all boils down to whether or not Russell Westbrook will remain the Russell Westbrook we know and love and sometimes criticize for inefficiency and off-ball malaise now that he\u2019s in Houston. Given that he was just three assists shy of a triple-double in the Rockets\u2019 other game, the results are encouraging so far.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Only Oscar Robertson lies in front of Russell Westbrook on the all-time triple doubles list.", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9_T62qsQC.JS6hnA2kRJag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD0xMDEwLjEzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzM-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VtL7_GFUJb6P6zPn5UCaJA--~B/aD0xNzE5O3c9MjE3OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/72c5ac90-f86a-11e9-94f5-62aefa41881c", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
