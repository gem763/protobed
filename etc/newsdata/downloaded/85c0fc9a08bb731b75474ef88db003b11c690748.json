Nevertheless, the bloc\u2019s executive European Commission avoided dismissing them too early in public.\n\n\u201cWe want to look at it objectively. We want to enter into constructive discussions,\u201d spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said.\n\nWith the EU still left wondering whether Johnson was truly seeking an agreement or just trying to create a semblance of negotiation to then blame it if and when it fails, the bloc was cautious.\n\n\u201cWe are going to examine the text,\u201d a senior EU diplomat told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t blow this out of the water but we are going to subject it to the most rigorous analysis. Either this is a negotiation or it isn\u2019t. If it is we will examine this proposal rigorously, and in light of extremely important criteria.\u201d\n\nBritain is seeking intensified and entirely secret talks with the EU on its latest proposal, which Johnson\u2019s Brexit negotiator David Frost delivered to it on Wednesday.\n\nBut, behind the officially constructive tone, there is very little hope left in the EU that a deal can be had with London - and ratified by the factious British parliament - before the Oct.31 deadline.\n\n\u201cThe proposal is fundamentally flawed,\u201d a senior European Union official said earlier in the day.\n\nAn EU diplomat dealing with Brexit said separately that the London plan \u201cwon\u2019t fly\u201d.\n\nThey added that heavyweights France and Germany would not press Ireland to accept a proposal being offered by Britain that would affect its currently open border with Northern Ireland.\n\nWith the EU determined to avoid any abrupt, no-deal split later this month, EU sources saw another delay to Brexit as increasingly likely.\n\nThe 27 EU member states staying on together would not reject a request from Britain to that end because they would not want to be held responsible for any ensuing tremors.\n\n\u201cIf they want to commit a stupidity it should be fully their responsibility,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe EU will never push the UK out, the Union will never close the door.\u201d\n\nThe tension raises the stakes before an Oct.17-18 summit of EU leaders at which London hopes to seal a new deal and leave two weeks later.\n\nRAISING STAKES\n\nJohnson wants to change a Withdrawal Agreement that his predecessor Theresa May had negotiated with the bloc but which then failed three times in the British parliament.\n\nHe wants to strike out the so-called backstop, or emergency arrangements to uphold the open border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit, when border checks would become necessary. [nL5N26N4QJ]\n\nSo far, Britain\u2019s ideas on alternatives to achieve these conflicting goals have failed to convince the EU. The bloc says any change must satisfy the same objectives as the backstop.\n\nThese are: maintaining a fully open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, protecting the EU single market, and maintaining the north-south cooperation made possible by the 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of conflict.\n\n\u201cThe remaining options are \u2013 the original, Northern Ireland-only backstop with some modifications, or an extension,\u201d said the diplomat.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Flags flutter outside the Houses of Parliament, ahead of a Brexit vote, in London, Britain March 13, 2019. REUTERS/Tom Jacobs/File Photo\n\nThe bloc sees the sole possible deal around effectively keeping Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the United Kingdom - in the EU\u2019s trade orbit by drawing a border across the Irish Sea.\n\nJohnson has ruled out the Northern Ireland-only backstop idea both publicly and in private.\n\nAn EU lawmaker dealing with Brexit said after the British premier\u2019s speech on Wednesday: \u201cWe are confronted with a prime minister whose strategy, I think, is to achieve a no-deal Brexit and blame EU \u2018friends\u2019 for the unsuccessful outcome.\u201d[nL5N26N3FJ", "description": "Britain's latest Brexit proposal was bound for a cool reception in the European Union but the bloc stressed it would examine it in detail as both sides seek to sidestep blame over the increasingly intractable divorce.", "authors": ["John Chalmers", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436288601&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910OO"}
