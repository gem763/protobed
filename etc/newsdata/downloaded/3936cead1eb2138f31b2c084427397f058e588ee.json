The animal had been moved to the Rolling Hills Zoo in Salina, Kansas, in June while his Chicago habitat received an upgrade.\n\nAs noted in a Facebook post from the Rolling Hills Zoo, the 9-year-old exhibited some behavioral changes last Thursday, though a physical performed that day ruled out any abnormalities. However, he died sometime that night. A necropsy will be performed this week.\n\nThe lion, born on Jan. 27, 2010, at the Bronx Zoo in New York City, had relocated to Kansas with the Lincoln Park Zoo\u2019s two female lions, Kamali and Zalika.\n\nIn a Facebook tribute to the animal, the Rolling Hills Zoo staff called Kamali Sahar\u2019s \u201cfavorite,\u201d and said she was \u201cby his side wherever he was in the yard.\u201d\n\n\u201cSahar could be seen out in the lion exhibit watching over the pride as well as visitors from a high spot on the rocks, lounging under the shade structure or napping in the yard,\u201d staffers wrote.\n\nIn a Facebook post from the \u201cheartbroken\u201d Lincoln Park Zoo staff, keepers shared that Sahar came to Chicago in 2012, and \u201cspent his years here growing into his mane and learning to be a pride member. He is loved by so many of our staff, members, volunteers, and Chicagoans.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute, male lions in zoos can live into their late teens, or even early 20s. In the wild, the animal\u2019s life expectancy is closer to 12 years.", "description": "The animal exhibited some abnormal behaviors the day before his death, but nothing doctors deemed suspicious", "authors": ["Kate Hogan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GARjpyy.iACSfMSlNX4D5A--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/7dba02da4a55cd5309514f27afa6cef5", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
