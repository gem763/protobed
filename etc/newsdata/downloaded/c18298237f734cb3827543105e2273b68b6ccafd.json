In the other three years of that cycle, there is no statistically significant difference between the returns in the Halloween-to-May Day period (the \u201cwinter\u201d months) than in the other half of the year (the \u201csummer\u201d months).\n\nBecause we\u2019re entering the final year of President Donald Trump\u2019s term, therefore, this seasonal pattern will be of no help to the stock market over the coming six months.\n\nRead: Another stock market worry: The year leading up to a presidential election tends to be below average\n\nCredit for discovering that the presidential third year is the source of the Halloween Indicator goes to Kam Fong Chan, a professor at the University of Western Australia, and Terry Marsh, an emeritus finance professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and CEO of Quantal International, an investment management firm based in San Francisco. (Click here to read their study.)\n\nThe relevant data are summarized in the table below, based on the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.07% going back to its creation in the late 1800s.\n\nAverage \u201cwinter\u201d return Average \u201csummer\u201d return Difference in winter and summer returns is significant at the 95% confidence level All years 5.3% 1.61% Yes Third year of presidential cycle 10.7% -0.0% Yes First, second, and fourth years of presidential cycle 3.5% 2.1% No\n\nAs you can see, but for the third years of the presidential cycle, the Halloween Indicator does not exist.\n\nWhy is this seasonal pattern so pronounced in just the third year of the cycle? Chan and Marsh speculate that it traces to the unusual level of economic policy uncertainty that exists prior to the midterm elections. That uncertainty holds the stock market back prior to those elections, resulting in an upsurge immediately after as that uncertainty is resolved.\n\nTo be sure, you probably wouldn\u2019t have otherwise thought that uncertainty would be highest immediately prior to midterm elections. Wouldn\u2019t that uncertainty be even higher prior to presidential elections? While acknowledging these questions, the researchers report that, at least according to one objective measure, uncertainty on average is indeed highest prior to midterm elections. That measure is the Economic Policy Uncertainty index created by Scott Baker of Northwestern University, Nick Bloom of Stanford University, and Steven Davis of The University of Chicago.\n\nNote carefully that the absence of this seasonal pattern over the coming year doesn\u2019t mean the U.S. stock market won\u2019t perform better over the next six months than it has over the past six. But if it does perform better, it won\u2019t be because of the Halloween Indicator.\n\nFurthermore, you might even be able to use the research from Chan and Marsh to beat the Halloween Indicator at its own game. The key is to focus on fluctuations in economic policy uncertainty rather than mechanically following the calendar.\n\nFor example, if you believe economic policy uncertainty is going to grow over the next months, you might want to reduce your equity exposure. Only if you think uncertainty will diminish would you want to maintain or increase that exposure.\n\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.
