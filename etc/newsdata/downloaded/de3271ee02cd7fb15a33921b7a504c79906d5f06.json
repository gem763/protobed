There\u2019s the ultimate option and there are options that are a lot less than that. And we\u2019ll see,\u201d Trump told reporters in Los Angeles. \u201cI\u2019m saying the ultimate option meaning go in \u2014 war.\u201d\n\nTrump, who earlier said on Twitter that he had ordered the U.S. Treasury to \u201csubstantially increase sanctions on the country of Iran!\u201d told reporters the unspecified, punitive economic measures would be unveiled within 48 hours.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet followed repeated U.S. assertions that the Islamic Republic was behind Saturday\u2019s attacks and came hours after Saudi Arabia said the strike was a \u201ctest of global will\u201d.\n\nIran again denied involvement in the Sept. 14 raids, which hit the world\u2019s biggest crude oil processing facility and initially knocked out half of Saudi output. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s leading oil exporter.\n\nResponsibility was claimed by Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group, which on Wednesday gave more details of the raid, saying it was launched from three sites in Yemen.\n\nIn a remark that may further strain an already tense political atmosphere in the Gulf, the Houthis also said they had dozens of sites in the United Arab Emirates, Riyadh\u2019s top Arab ally, listed as possible targets for attacks.\n\nIn an attempt to bolster its assertion that Iran was responsible, Saudi Arabia showed drone and missile debris it said amounted to undeniable evidence of Iranian aggression.\n\nA total of 25 drones and missiles were used in the attacks sponsored by Iran but not launched from Yemen, Defence Ministry spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told a news conference.\u201dThe attack was launched from the north and unquestionably sponsored by Iran,\u201d he said, adding Iranian Delta Wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) were used in addition to cruise missiles.\n\nAn investigation into the origin of the attacks was still under way and the result will be announced later, he said.\n\nThe attack exposed gaps in Saudi air defences despite billions spent on Western military hardware.\n\nProof of Iranian responsibility, and in particular firm evidence that the attack was launched from Iranian territory, could pressure Riyadh and Washington into a response. Both nations, however, were stressing the need for caution.\n\nTrump has previously said he does not want war and is coordinating with Gulf and European states.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler, said the strike was a \u201creal test of the global will\u201d to confront subversion of the international order.\n\nHis envoy to London, Prince Khalid bin Bander, told the BBC the attack was \u201calmost certainly\u201d Iranian-backed: \u201cWe\u2019re trying not to react too quickly because the last thing we need is more conflict in the region.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic Republic dismissed the allegations.\n\n\u201cThey want to impose maximum ... pressure on Iran through slander,\u201d Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want conflict in the region ... Who started the conflict?\u201d he added, blaming Washington and its Gulf allies for the war in Yemen.\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi movement, battling a Western-backed, Saudi-led coalition for more than four years, said it used drones to assault state oil company Aramco\u2019s sites.\n\nThe raid exposed the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure and threw down a gauntlet to the United States, which wants to curb Iranian influence in the region. \u201cThe attack is like Sept. 11th for Saudi Arabia, it is a game changer,\u201d said one Saudi security analyst.\n\n\u201cAN ACT OF WAR\u201d\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who met Prince Mohammed in Jeddah to discuss the crisis, said the attacks would be a major focus of next week\u2019s annual U.N. General Assembly meeting and suggested Saudi Arabia could make its case there.\n\nSaudi defence ministry spokesman Colonel Turki Al-Malik displays remains of the missiles which Saudi government says were used to attack an Aramco oil facility, during a news conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia September 18, 2019. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed\n\nPompeo called the attacks \u201can act of war.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Saudis were the nation that was attacked. It was on their soil. It was an act of war against them directly, and I\u2019m confident they will do that,\u201d he told reporters before meeting the Saudi crown prince.\n\nU.N. officials monitoring sanctions on Iran and Yemen were also heading to Saudi Arabia to investigate. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said a major confrontation in the Gulf would have \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d for the region and globally.\n\nFrance, which is trying to salvage an international nuclear deal with Iran that Washington quit last year, said it wanted to establish the facts before reacting.\n\nA U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday the strikes originated in southwestern Iran. Three officials said they involved cruise missiles and drones, indicating a higher degree of complexity and sophistication than initially thought.\n\nThe officials did not provide evidence or explain what U.S. intelligence they were using for evaluating the attack.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s finance minister told Reuters the attack had no impact on revenues and Aramco was continuing to supply markets without interruption.\n\nU.S. efforts to bring about a U.N. Security Council response looked unlikely to succeed as Russia and China have veto powers and were expected to shield Iran.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, who has offered to sell defence systems to Riyadh, called for a \u201cthorough and impartial\u201d probe during a phone call with Prince Mohammed.\n\nIRAN-U.S. CONFLICT\n\nThe 2015 nuclear deal ushered in a brief detente in long hostile relations between Iran and the United States. But antagonism returned when Trump pulled out of the pact, reached before he took office, and reimposed sanctions, severely damaging the Iranian economy. Iran has ruled out talks with Washington unless it returns to the pact.\n\nTrump said he is not looking to meet Rouhani during a U.N. event in New York this month. Rouhani and his foreign minister may not attend the General Assembly at all unless U.S. visas are issued in the coming hours, Iranian state media reported on Wednesday.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nWashington and its Gulf allies want Iran to stop supporting regional proxies, including in Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon.\n\nDespite years of air strikes against it, the Houthi movement boasts drones and missiles able to reach deep into Saudi Arabia, the result of an arms race since the Western-backed coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015.\n\nIran\u2019s clerical rulers support the Houthis, who ousted Yemen\u2019s internationally recognised government from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014. But Tehran denies that it actively arms and finances the Houthi movement.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday there were many options short of war with Iran after U.S. ally Saudi Arabia displayed remnants of drones and missiles it said were used in a crippling attack on its oil sites that was \"unquestionably sponsored\" by Tehran.", "authors": ["Jeff Mason", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431276222&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1A1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
