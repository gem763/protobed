Martin Frank, The News Journal\n\nARLINGTON, Texas \u2013 There are defining moments in every season when a team can either pull it together or break apart.\n\nThe Eagles are at one of those moments.\n\nThey were humbled and humiliated in so many ways in their 37-10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night. This came one week after the same thing happened against the Vikings.\n\nIn those two games, the Eagles have been outscored 75-30.\n\n\"There are no excuses,\" right tackle Lane Johnson said. \"It's make or break time. We'll find out what we're made of moving forward here in the next few weeks.\"\n\nSo far, the results aren't encouraging.\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 7 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nNFL Week 7 winners, losers: Aaron Rodgers now in MVP race; Mitchell Trubisky looks lost\n\nThe Eagles already endured a week when an anonymous player criticized the offense and quarterback Carson Wentz, as well as general manager Howie Roseman, for not making a trade for cornerback Jalen Ramsey.\n\nThe Eagles already tried shaking things up last week. They released Zach Brown, a starting linebacker, after he mouthed off about Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins, in addition to his mediocre at best play.\n\nAnd head coach Doug Pederson made his \"sort of\" guarantee for a victory.\n\nThen the Eagles played even worse against the Cowboys.\n\nPederson was asked if this was his worst loss in his 3 1/2 seasons as head coach.\n\n\"It's either one or two, yes,\" he said.\n\nWhen that happens, changes can't be too far behind.\n\n\"Putting out a (bad) performance like that is something we can't do,\" Johnson said. \"Moving forward, there's going to be a lot of stuff changing. Maybe players, maybe a lot of stuff changing, I don't know. I've been in this business for a long time, and I know when stuff doesn't go right, there are changes to be made.\"\n\nThat's especially true when there are signs of surrender.\n\nThat perhaps was the most troubling sign, both on offense and defense.\n\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Carson Wentz threw a ball deep down the field to wide receiver Nelson Agholor, who had gotten behind his defender. It appeared that Agholor didn't extend his arms to make a play on the ball, which fell incomplete.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, it wouldn't have made a difference other than to make the score a little more respectable. Still, Wentz's reaction was telling because typically the quarterback will take the blame, whether it's warranted or not.\n\n\"I thought we had a touchdown when I threw it,\" Wentz said. \"I didn\u2019t see the end result. I was on the ground, so I didn\u2019t get a chance to see. But when I threw it, I thought we had a good one there. But I gotta make a better throw, obviously.\"\n\nAgholor, meanwhile, gave his version of the play.\n\n\u201cI was trying to get open,\u201d he said. \"I was hauling tail, making a move on the safety, using the space that I had to run across the field and I was running. And by the time I was trying to track it, the ball was already at a position. I wish I had been able to get there. But I don\u2019t know what happened.\"\n\nDid he lose it in the lights?\n\n\u201cI made a move on a guy and I\u2019m starting to run to my landmark and I get closer and I\u2019m seeing it low in trajectory, so it is what it is,\" he said. \"I can\u2019t really explain it.\u201d\n\nAgholor is not one to give up. But he does seem to have trouble tracking deep balls, an area that DeSean Jackson, who missed his fifth straight game with an abdominal injury, thrives at.\n\nThat was hardly the Eagles' only problem.\n\nThe defense had no chance against the Cowboys. Dallas had a 14-0 lead six minutes into the game after two turnovers led to easy touchdowns. Malcolm Jenkins got run over by Ezekiel Elliott on one TD, Orlando Scandrick waved at Tavon Austin on another and the penalties were omnipresent.\n\nIt was 27-7 at halftime, the second straight game in which the Eagles allowed at least 24 points in the first half.\n\n\"It's (expletive) embarrassing,\" cornerback Rasul Douglas said. \"We weren't solid on defense. We turned the ball over on offense ... Come on, man. You can't win like that.\"\n\nAnd the Eagles won't, not until something changes.\n\n\"What has to change is we've got to roll our sleeves up and go to work,\" Pederson said. \"We've got to figure out what's going on. We've got nine games left. It's going to start with me. I'm going to own this one for the football team ... We've got the guys in the locker room to get it fixed. I know that, and I still have a lot of faith in them, a lot of trust, and we'll get it fixed.\"\n\nThere is plenty to fix.\n\nJohnson described the problems on offense: \"There was no run game, no pass game, any rhythm. You saw that. No rhythm. No consistency.\"\n\nTight end Zach Ertz was just as frustrated. He didn't have a reception until the fourth quarter, and ended up with just two for 38 yards. Ertz set a record for receptions by a tight end last season with 116. He's on pace for about 80 this season.\n\n\"Tonight was embarrassing, one of the most embarrassing games I've ever been a part of in Philly, a pitiful performance,\" Ertz said. \"We\u2019re gonna see what the character of this team is. That's the bottom line.\n\n\"This feeling kills me ... It\u2019s tough right now the way this team is playing.\u201d\n\nIt doesn't get easier. The Eagles are on the road against the Buffalo Bills, at 5-1, next Sunday. Then they have three straight home games against the Bears, Patriots and Seahawks, all playoff teams last season.\n\n\"What are we going to do? How are we going to respond?\" defensive end Brandon Graham said. \"Are we going to tank? Because this is going to define our season.\n\n\"I have seen this thing play out so many different ways. We get healthy, we get people back, we will be alright.\"\n\nThat Graham is even asking those questions is troubling enough.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.
