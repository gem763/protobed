But tonight the sounds of explosions and planes frighten us as they continue to fly across the city\u2019s skies,\u201d resident Mohammed Abdullah told Reuters.\n\nOn Thursday night, the coalition said it had intercepted and destroyed an explosives-laden boat launched from Yemen by the Houthi group.\n\nThe Houthis, who have threatened to widen attacks on Saudi Arabia, have in the past targeted vessels off Yemen, which lies on one side of the Bab al-Mandeb strait at the southern mouth of the Red Sea, one of the world\u2019s most vital oil tanker routes.\n\nThe incident comes as the United States and Saudi Arabia consider responses to the assault on Saudi oil facilities, which Washington and Riyadh blame on common foe Iran.
