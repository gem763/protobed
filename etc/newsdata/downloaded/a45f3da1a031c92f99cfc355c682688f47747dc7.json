No f**ks given,\u2019 while another shared a clip of the moment and added: \u2018When you are bored at a concert\u2026 #thismorning.\u2019\n\nEamonn Holmes caught checking phone during Shalamar performance (Picture: ITV)\n\n\u2018Eammon on his phone. What a mood,\u2019 another viewer said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers, however, were more focused on the singing, with someone commenting: \u2018Oh I loved that!! Got me right in the Friday mood!\u2019\n\nAs a fan also wrote: \u2018Aww I was a snotty lil 6 year old when this song came out in 82 , not feeling slightly old at all lol.\u2019\n\nThe duo are yet to mention phone-gate, but we\u2019re not too sure Eamonn knows he was caught.\n\nEarlier on in the show, the pair got chatting to a woman who had rescued and lives with 27 paralysed dogs.\n\nClaire Louise, who runs the charity Wheels To Paws UK, spoke to Alison Hammond about her non-profit organisation.\n\nAnd while surrounded by her pack, the pooch lover couldn\u2019t help but joke about their names.\n\nPointing to one of her fur babies, Claire laughed: \u2018That one is called Elton John because he was paralysed but he is still standing.\u2019\n\nShe continued to explain her situation, adding: \u2018Basically, they come from all over the world. We started off with Thomas Cook, and he does like to travel.\u2019\n\nThis Morning continues weekdays at 10.30am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
