The report appeared to support other signs of economic deterioration after ISM\u2019s survey of the U.S. manufacturing sector showed the worst reading in about a decade.\n\nHowever, markets rebounded \u2014 perhaps partly on hopes that the Federal Reserve will continue to ease monetary policy at the end of the month, providing some support for higher stock values even if the economy\u2019s historic expansion begins to crumble.\n\nWall Street expectations for a 25 basis-point cut at the end of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s two-day gathering Oct. 30 jumped to 90.3% from 77% a day ago and about 49% a week ago, according to CME Group based on federal-funds futures.\n\nThat may have been the reason bond yields, which fall as prices rise, skidded lower on Thursday, suggesting that investors were fleeing to the perceived safety of government paper despite the Thursday rebound. The 10-year Treasury note yield fell about 6 basis points to 1.531%, representing the first time since March 15, 2017 that the S&P 500 gained at least 0.8% while yields also jumped 6 basis points.\n\nExpectations for a rate cut could momentarily support buying in bonds, because future yields are expected to head lower, and embolden investors to pick up equities in the face of lower borrowing costs.\n\nHowever, bearish signs have abounded all week, making a key reading of employment, the nonfarm payrolls report, a likely inflection point for stocks on Friday.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index RUT, +0.45%, for example, suffered a so-called death cross for the first time since Nov. 14, 2018. Small-cap stocks are particularly vulnerable to worries about economic slowdowns. Many technical analysts believe the pattern, in which the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average, marking the spot a shorter-term decline transitions into a longer-term downtrend.", "description": "The stock market\u2019s turnaround on Thursday was notable for producing the sharpest reversal for the three main U.S. equity benchmarks, with the Nasdaq...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS627_comeba_ZG_20191003161529.jpg"}
