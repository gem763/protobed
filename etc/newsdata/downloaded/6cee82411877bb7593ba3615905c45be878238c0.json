I have received from the prime minister reassuring answers and an availability to cooperate with the European Parliament.\"\n\nBut one German MEP told Euronews that she's not seen any backing down by the Romanian government, since being warned by the EU.\n\nReforms would 'legalise corruption'\n\n\"I am very worried about the situation in Romania because the laws changes that are partly proposed and partly already voted, they would put a serious threat to tackling corruption in Romania, would basically legalise corruption and would make it very difficult for the reformed justice system to go after corrupt people,\" said Ska Keller, from the Group of the Greens.\n\nThousands of Romanians have protested against the judicial overhaul. And they'll no doubt have been further angered by the prime minister's recent refusal to fire a key adviser, given a prison sentence for corruption and money-laundering.", "description": "Viorica Dancila meets EU leaders after Bucharest is warned over judicial reforms, which critics say undermine efforts to combat corruption", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/08/37/26/1000x563_story-2c831e66-41c4-5cef-961c-94b40550c100_582039.jpg", "published_at": "2018-02-20"}
