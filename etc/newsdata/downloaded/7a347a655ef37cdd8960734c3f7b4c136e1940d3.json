(Photo: Getty Images / nortonrsx)\n\n\u2014 Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need. If you sign up for a credit card after clicking one of our links, we may earn a small fee for referring you. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY's newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nIf you freelance, run a sole proprietorship, moonlight as a Task Rabbit, Uber driver or Postmates delivery person, or otherwise work for yourself, there's plenty to love about your flexible schedule and the control you have over work projects. The downside? You also have to foot the bill for all your small-business expenses, from travel to taxes and office space. In other words, your money has to stretch in several directions.\n\nI\u2019m a freelancer who has been working in the personal finance space for nine years, so I know how to get the best deal when it comes to your own finances and your business's. While there are many business credit cards out there, it's important to understand how to find the right one for your freelance enterprise. The best business credit cards for freelancers can help you separate business expenses from personal, save money on interest each year, and reward you for expenses like airfare, gasoline, office supplies and social media marketing. (If you think you may hire employees someday, check out our list of the best business credit cards.)\n\nWhatever your hustle is, here are seven credit cards bound to maximize your freelance business and make your spending\u2014and your time\u2014a little more valuable.\n\nThe best credit cards for freelancers\n\nHow we evaluated\n\nWe looked at business credit cards from the major issuers and measured their benefits, rewards and costs, and how cardholders might use the card and redeem rewards. Freelancers are typically solopreneurs who have to pay for every cost, market themselves, manage client communications and do the bookkeeping. Although always focused on business growth, their income may be lower than a small-business owner who has several employees and a handful of branch locations. So freelancers need a card that rewards their unique spending habits, builds in perks that outweigh any fees, and offers cost-saving measures, such as a 0% intro APR that can see them through cash shortfalls and gaps in projects.\n\nWe also took a look at business-management tools, which you won't find on most personal credit cards. The IRS requires business owners to categorize expenses and income for tax purposes, so it\u2019s a nice draw if the credit card offers an app that handles this task for you.\n\nBefore applying for a card, know that banks have final say on who's approved. These recommendations were put together assuming applicants would have average to excellent credit, with the exception of the Wells Fargo Business Secured Credit Card. Credit card issuers will check your credit history and use its own set of criteria when evaluating your application.\n\nThings to know about business credit cards\n\nNearly every business card requires a personal guarantee, which is an agreement between the business owner and the credit card issuer. It means the issuer can go after your personal assets to satisfy any balance owed if your business defaults on the card payments\u2014even if you leave the company. That goes for expenses you or your employees charge to the credit card. Using your business credit card can help you build business credit, which can be useful if you need a business loan in the future. Here's a quick rundown on how it works: Business credit card issuers can report your credit card account activity to both the personal credit reporting agencies and the business reporting agencies, such as Dun & Bradstreet and Experian. These agencies use the information in your report to create a credit score for your business, which helps lenders measure risk before extending you credit. If you're worried about this card affecting your personal credit, ask the issuer how it will report your payments (before applying for the card). The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, better known as the CARD Act, is a law that improved consumer protections. It regulates how interest rates, fees and finance charges are calculated on credit cards and provides more transparent rules that issuers have to follow. The law doesn't extend to business credit cards, though some issuers are extending the CARD Act's protections to its business products. Get to know the card's features and terms before you apply\u2014and ask questions\u2014so you don't get dinged with unexpected fees.\n\nBest overall: SimplyCash Plus Business Credit Card from American Express\n\nSimplyCash Plus Business Credit Card from American Express (Photo: Reviewed / Naidin Concul-Ticas)\n\nEvery company has a different set of expenses.

You'll earn 3 points per dollar spent on travel, get a higher rate for travel rewards through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal and can even transfer points to several Chase travel partners.
