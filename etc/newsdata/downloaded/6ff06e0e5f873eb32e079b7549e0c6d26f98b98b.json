(Ukraine Presidential Press Service/EPA-EFE) (Ukraine Presidential Press Service/Handout/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nSix weeks after it was submitted, a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower has been declassified and released publicly. The seven-page document details a series of actions, meetings and conversations over a months-long period in which President Trump and his lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani sought to encourage an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden by officials in Ukraine.\n\nPart of the complaint centers on a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a rough transcript of which was released Wednesday. The whistleblower complaint, filed more than a month earlier, accurately captures the content of that call, lending validity to the rest of the assertions in the complaint.\n\nWith that in mind, we\u2019ve pulled out the significant dates mentioned in the whistleblower complaint to give a sense of how the effort by Trump and Giuliani to elicit an investigation in Ukraine unfolded. Events not included in the whistleblower complaint itself are in italics. All quotes are from the whistleblower complaint.\n\nThe timeline of events\n\nMay 13, 2014. Hunter Biden, the son of then-Vice President Joe Biden, joins the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. It is owned by oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky, one of several subjects of the Ukrainian corruption probe.\n\nDec. 9, 2015. Joe Biden travels to Ukraine, giving a speech that touches on concerns about corruption in the country. At some point, he tells Ukrainian leaders to fire Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin or lose more than $1 billion in loan guarantees. Biden joins many Western leaders in urging Shokin\u2019s ouster.\n\nMarch 29, 2016. Shokin is ousted from his position by Ukraine\u2019s parliament.\n\nMay 12, 2016. Yuriy Lutsenko becomes prosecutor general of Ukraine, replacing Shokin.\n\nJan. 23, 2018. At an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations, Biden describes the pressure he put on Ukraine\u2019s government.\n\nLate 2018. Giuliani speaks with Shokin.\n\nDec. 12, 2018. A court rules that publication of secret documents delineating under-the-table payments to eventual Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort by a Ukrainian political party was a form of interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The ruling concludes that two officials, including member of parliament Serhiy Leshchenko, broke the law in publicizing the documents.\n\nLate January. Giuliani meets with Lutsenko in New York.\n\nMid-February. Giuliani again meets with Lutsenko, this time in Warsaw.\n\nMarch. Still in office as prosecutor general, Lutsenko begins making allegations about the Bidens\u2019 activities in Ukraine and the 2016 election as a March 31 election date approaches. The whistleblower notes that Lutsenko works for the incumbent, Petro Poroshenko, who is trailing Zelensky \u2014 who had promised to replace Lutsenko.\n\nMarch 20. The Hill\u2019s John Solomon interviews Lutsenko. Among other allegations, Lutsenko claims that U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch had given him a list of people not to prosecute and that he was opening an investigation of Leshchenko.\n\nMarch 31. The first round of Ukraine\u2019s presidential election is held. Poroshenko and Zelensky head to a runoff.\n\nApril 1. After speaking with Lutsenko, Solomon reports that a probe into Joe Biden\u2019s push to fire Lutsenko\u2019s predecessor is underway. Lutsenko tells Solomon that he wants to present his evidence to Attorney General William P. Barr.\n\nApril 17. Lutsenko walks back his claims about a do-not-prosecute list.\n\nApril 18. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III releases his report detailing his team\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nApril 21. Zelensky easily defeats Poroshenko in a runoff election. Trump and Zelensky have a \u201cbrief\u201d call in which Trump congratulates Zelensky on winning the country\u2019s presidential election.\n\nApril 23. Giuliani tweets about an Ukrainian investigation into 2016.\n\nHillary is correct the report is the end of the beginning for the second time...NO COLLUSION. Now Ukraine is investigating Hillary campaign and DNC conspiracy with foreign operatives including Ukrainian and others to affect 2016 election. And there\u2019s no Comey to fix the result. \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) April 23, 2019\n\nApril 25. In an interview with Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity, Trump addresses the suggestion that Ukraine interfered in 2016.\n\n\u201cI would imagine [Barr] would want to see this,\u201d Trump says. \u201cPeople have been saying this whole \u2014 the concept of Ukraine, they have been talking about it actually for a long time.\u201d\n\nApril 29. Ambassador Yovanovitch is recalled to the United States.\n\n\u201cAround the same time,\u201d the whistleblower writes, \u201cI also learned from a U.S. official that \u2018associates\u2019 of Mr. Giuliani were trying to make contact with the incoming Zelensky team.\"\n\nMay. Two associates of Giuliani travel to Ukraine and meet with Ukrainian officials, according to a report cited by the whistleblower.\n\nGiuliani meets with a top Ukrainian anti-corruption prosecutor, Nazar Kholodnytsky, in Paris, according to Kholodnytsky. Kholodnytsky, who had clashed with Yovanovitch, has declined to comment on what he and Giuliani discussed, but he said the Burisma investigation should be reopened.\n\nMay 6. Yovanovitch is removed from her position. The whistleblower says this was because of pressure originating with the Lutsenko allegations.\n\nMay 9. The New York Times reports that Giuliani plans to travel to Ukraine to push for investigations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not meddling in an election, we\u2019re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,\u201d Giuliani tells the Times. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing illegal about it. Somebody could say it\u2019s improper. And this isn\u2019t foreign policy \u2014 I\u2019m asking them to do an investigation that they\u2019re doing already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I\u2019m going to give them reasons why they shouldn\u2019t stop it because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.\u201d\n\nMay 10. Giuliani again tweets about a Ukrainian investigation.\n\nExplain to me why Biden shouldn\u2019t be investigated if his son got millions from a Russian loving crooked Ukrainian oligarch while He was VP and point man for Ukraine. Ukrainians are investigating and your fellow Dems are interfering. Election is 17 months away.Let\u2019s answer it now https://t.co/FT34kX7Pst \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) May 10, 2019\n\nTrump later tells Politico that he will speak to Giuliani about his planned trip to Ukraine. Giuliani then cancels the trip.\n\nMay 11. Lutsenko and Zelensky meet for two hours, with the former requesting to stay in his position.\n\nMay 13. Barr announces a probe into the origins of the investigation into Russian interference. The whistleblower cites a report claiming that the Giuliani investigators\u2019 work will aid this probe.\n\nMay 14. Trump tells Vice President Pence not to attend Zelensky\u2019s inauguration. Instead, Energy Secretary Rick Perry attends.\n\nIt was \u201cmade clear\u201d to officials who spoke with the whistleblower that \u201cthe President did not want to meet with Mr. Zelenskyy until he saw how Zelenskyy \u2018chose to act\u2019 in office.\"\n\nGiuliani tells a Ukrainian journalist that Yovanovitch was \u201cremoved \u2026 because she was part of the efforts against the president.\"\n\nMid-May. The whistleblower starts hearing concerns about Giuliani\u2019s circumvention of the government\u2019s official processes as regards Ukraine.\n\nThe whistleblower is told that officials, including Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker and E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland, had spoken with Giuliani to \u201ccontain the damage\u201d he was doing and that the ambassadors had been working with Ukrainian officials to help them figure out how to resolve the conflict between government messaging and Giuliani\u2019s.\n\nIn the same time frame, officials told the whistleblower that Ukrainian leaders believed \u201cthat a meeting or phone call between the President and President Zelenskyy would depend on whether Zelenskyy showed willingness to \u2018play ball\u2019 on the issues that had been publicly aired by Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. Giuliani.\"\n\nMay 16. Lutsenko walks back his claim about a probe into the Bidens.\n\nMay 19. In an interview with Fox News, Trump explicitly references Biden\u2019s efforts in Ukraine, falsely claiming that Biden pushed for Shokin to be fired because of Hunter Biden\u2019s work.\n\nMay 20. Zelensky is inaugurated as president of Ukraine. Shortly after the inauguration, Giuliani meets with Ukrainian officials who are allies of Lutsenko and who made allegations included in Solomon\u2019s reporting.\n\nJune 13. In an interview with ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, Trump says he might accept electoral assistance from a foreign government, if offered.\n\nThe chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission subsequently points out on Twitter that this would be illegal.\n\nJune 21.\n\nNew Pres of Ukraine still silent on investigation of Ukrainian interference in 2016 election and alleged Biden bribery of Pres Poroshenko. Time for leadership and investigate both if you want to purge how Ukraine was abused by Hillary and Obama people. \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) June 21, 2019\n\nJuly 12. Axios reports that Trump and Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats are at odds, with Trump telling confidants that he wants to remove Coats from his position.\n\nMid-July. The whistleblower learns that the White House is withholding aid to Ukraine.\n\nJuly 16. Former MP Leshchenko, accused of interference in 2016, states that the court ruling from December has been overturned on appeal.\n\nJuly 18. The Office of Management and Budget tells administration offices to suspend aid to Ukraine per Trump\u2019s orders earlier in the month.\n\nJuly 20. In an interview with Fox News, Trump links Ukraine and the effort to hack the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election \u2014 a link that the whistleblower (and recent reporting) suggests doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nJuly 22. Shokin tells The Washington Post that he was removed over the Biden issue. Other officials have suggested this isn\u2019t true.\n\nJuly 23. OMB reiterates that aid to Ukraine is suspended, per Trump.\n\nJuly 24. Mueller testifies before Congress.\n\nJuly 25, morning. Trump and Zelensky speak by phone early in the morning. The whistleblower reports that in the call Trump \u201cpressured\u201d Zelensky to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden, to \u201cassist in purportedly uncovering that allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine\u201d \u2014 as in the July 20 Fox interview \u2014 and to meet or speak with Giuliani and Barr.\n\nThe whistleblower wasn\u2019t on the call but was informed that about a half-dozen people were on the call. That group included T. Ulrich Brechbuhl from the State Department, an aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nJuly 25, evening. Ukraine publishes a summary of the Trump-Zelensky call. It notes that Trump \u201cexpressed his conviction that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve Ukraine\u2019s image and complete the investigation of corruption cases that have held back cooperation between Ukraine and the United States .\"\n\nEmphasis added by the whistleblower.\n\nDays following July 25. The whistleblower writes: \u201cI learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to \u2018lock down\u2019 all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced \u2014 as is customary \u2014 by the White House Situation Room. This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\"\n\nThe whistleblower claims to have been told by White House officials that they were directed by White House lawyers to move the transcript from the normal documentation archive and to \u201ca separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature\u201d \u2014 a move one official called an \u201cact of abuse.\u201d\n\nIn an appendix, the whistleblower adds that officials said \u201cthis was \u2018not the first time\u2019 under this Administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2014 rather than national security sensitive \u2014 information.\"\n\nJuly 26. Volker and Sondland traveled to Kiev and met with Zelensky and other politicians. There, the whistleblower writes, they \u201creportedly provided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the President had made of\u201d Zelensky.\n\nOMB reiterates that aid to Ukraine is suspended, per Trump.\n\nJuly 28. Trump announces that Coats will resign in August.\n\nJuly 31. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin speak by phone.\n\nEarly August. Officials indicate to the whistleblower that Ukraine is aware that aid is being held, but the whistleblower doesn\u2019t know when they learned that.\n\nAug. 2. Giuliani travels to Madrid, where he meets with a Zelensky adviser named Andriy Yermak. This meeting was a \u201cdirect follow-up\u201d to the July 25 call, according to the whistleblower\u2019s sources. Giuliani had also been reaching out to other Zelensky advisers.\n\nAug. 3. Zelensky announces that he will travel to the United States to meet with Trump in Washington in September.\n\nAug. 8. Giuliani tells Fox News that the Justice Department official in charge of investigating the origins of the Russia probe is \u201cspending a lot of time in Europe\u201d to investigate what happened in Ukraine\n\nTrump announces Joseph Maguire will take Coats\u2019s job as director of national intelligence in an acting capacity. In doing so, he bypasses Sue Gordon, who had been Coats\u2019s No. 2 at the directorate of national intelligence and was a career intelligence official with bipartisan support. Gordon would later resign.\n\nAug. 9. Trump speaks to reporters outside the White House. He\u2019s asked about inviting Zelensky to the White House and what advice he would offer on dealing with Putin.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s going to make a deal with President Putin, and he will be invited to the White House,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we look forward to seeing him. He\u2019s already been invited to the White House, and he wants to come. And I think he will. He\u2019s a very reasonable guy. He wants to see peace in Ukraine. And I think he will be coming very soon, actually.\"\n\nAug. 12. The whistleblower complaint is filed.\n\nMid-August. Several Ukrainian officials are due to visit the United States.
