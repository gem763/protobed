But what every gamer wants to know is which one of their latest upgrades work best for them and we have the answer!\n\nPexels\n\nWhat do gamers want in a smartphone?\n\nEvery smartphone brand out there is offering bigger and better display screens with OLED displays and higher screen-to-body ratios. But after spending hours staring at your gaming screen, what gamers are really looking for are soothing display screens and higher refresh rates that can help make their eyes feel less tired.\n\nThe higher refresh rates also make scrolling through the different apps and webpages smoother. In addition, they make the gaming experience a lot sleeker. With a refresh rate higher than the average 60 frames per second, smartphone gaming is up for a revolution.\n\nOnePlus Vs Apple & Samsung\n\nTalking about the big Apple, the iPhone 11 series has stuck to the average 60Hz refresh rate for their screens. Even their most premium variant, the iPhone 11 Max doesn\u2019t go a notch higher than 60Hz even though it has the upgraded OLED display screen.\n\nDon't Miss 1.2 K SHARES 331 SHARES 1.9 K SHARES\n\nwccftech.com\n\nAnother giant competitor, Samsung missed out on this key display upgrade. Their latest flagship, the Samsung Note 10 Pro is innovative, to say the least but loses out on the display disadvantage. In spite of rumors floating around their refresh rate upgrade, the latest models only feature a 60Hz refresh rate.\n\nOnePlus on another hand has been a step ahead of its competitors. They identified the real deal and jumped on the chance to be one of the few brands to offer a 90Hz refresh rate. From the OnePlus 7 Pro to the OnePlus 7T variants, the gaming experience has only gotten better and smoother. The T-variants are a gamer\u2019s delight with their smoother user interface. Powered by the Snapdragon 855 Plus processor, the OnePlus 7T offers rapid reflexes and swift actions while gaming. The higher refresh rate makes the graphic transitions on the screen smoother and glitch-free. It enhances the gaming experience visually as well as in terms of interface.\n\nBGR\n\nOnePlus 7T for the win!\n\nAdd the 90Hz refresh rate to the Fluid AMOLED touchscreen with 1080x2400 pixels and we have a winner! The OnePlus 7T is also HDR 10 and HDR+ compatible making your gaming graphics more vibrant and clear. And here\u2019s the even better part, while the iPhone 11 series and the Samsung Note 10 burn a hole in your pocket, the OnePlus 7T is reasonably priced at Rs 37,999 for the basic variant.", "description": "We all know the top players in the premium smartphone segment \u2013 Apple, Samsung and Oneplus.
