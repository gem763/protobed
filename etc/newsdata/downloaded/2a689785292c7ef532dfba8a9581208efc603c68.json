Afghanistan has been pillaged and desecrated by the Taliban for two decades; the Islamic State has wrought destruction and looted artifacts in Iraq, Syria and Libya; and rebel factions have sacked museums and mosques in Yemen.\n\nWhile American forces are hardly expected to defend cultural treasures everywhere there is conflict, the military field manuals indicate that preserving artifacts \u201cis not only a legal obligation but also plays a vital role as a force multiplier, winning the hearts and minds of the local population.\u201d It also sends \u201ca strong message that the U.S. military is respectful and professional,\u201d the manuals say.\n\nThe United States suffered a black eye during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when it was faulted for failing to protect the Iraq National Museum in Baghdad from plunder amid the chaos of the city\u2019s fall. Archaeologists and State Department officials had warned that the museum\u2019s tens of thousands of ancient objects were vulnerable, but the military had no equivalent of the monuments team at that point.\n\nAfter that ransacking, Matthew Bogdanos, a colonel in the Marine reserves and classics scholar, formed an ad hoc group that took charge of protecting the museum and hunting down its stolen items. He wrote a book on his experience, \u201cThieves of Baghdad\u201d (2005). He serves as chief of the Antiquities Trafficking Unit of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, the only such department in the nation.\n\nOf the new unit, he said, \u201cIt was a great idea when I first proposed it in back in 2003, and it is even more crucial in today\u2019s world where antiquities trafficking often funds terrorism.\u201d", "description": "A new reserve unit, inspired by the Monuments Men of the World War II era, will aim to protect antiquities and important cultural sites in war zones.", "authors": ["Ralph Blumenthal", "Tom Mashberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/21/arts/21monmen2/merlin_162916923_7354fbf7-cabd-49b0-88d3-8e7630b40875-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
