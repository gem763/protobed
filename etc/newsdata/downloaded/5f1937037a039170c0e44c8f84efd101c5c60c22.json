I wanted him to get a deal from the EU that would have passed in the House of Commons. If that was to happen, I would have been elated.\n\n\u201cBut clearly, while he started out down that road, the strategy has morphed into something quite different. Taking the whip from hard-working Conservative MPs and sharp practices using prorogation of parliament have rebounded. I didn\u2019t support either of those things. Neither do I think a no-deal Brexit is a good idea.\u201d\n\nThe former prime minister urged Mr Johnson not to deliver a no-deal Brexit, saying: \u201cI think it is a bad outcome. I very much hope it doesn\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t think it should be pursued.\u201d\n\nIn his book, Mr Cameron reportedly claims that Mr Johnson and Mr Gove had behaved \u201cappallingly\u201d during the Brexit campaign and accuses Mr Gove of being \u201cmendacious\u201d.\n\nHe told The Times that the pair had \u201cleft the truth at home\u201d while campaigning for Vote Leave and admitted that, while he has since had \u201ca conversation\u201d with Mr Gove, the relationship between the two former friends remained \u201cdifficult\u201d.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Getty\n\nWith parliament still deadlocked over a Brexit outcome, Mr Cameron said another referendum should be considered, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can rule it out because we\u2019re stuck.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would campaign for another poll, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not saying one will happen or should happen. I\u2019m just saying that you can\u2019t rule things out right now because you\u2019ve got to find some way of unblocking the blockage.\n\n\u201cI think there are certain things you shouldn\u2019t do to unblock the blockage. I think proroguing parliament \u2013 pretending it doesn\u2019t exist \u2013 I think that would be a bad thing.\u201d\n\nThe former prime minister said he was \u201chugely depressed\u201d when he left No 10 and admitted that he thought about the consequences of the Brexit vote daily.\n\nHe said: \u201cEvery single day I think about it, the referendum and the fact that we lost and the consequences and the things that could have been done differently, and I worry desperately about what is going to happen next.\n\n\u201cI think we can get to a situation where we leave but we are friends, neighbours and partners. We can get there, but I would love to fast-forward to that moment because it\u2019s painful for the country and it\u2019s painful to watch.\u201d\n\nHowever, he insisted that his decision to call the referendum was the right one, saying: \u201cWhen I think through all the things I thought and all the arguments I had with colleagues and with myself, I still come to the same conclusion: that we were going to have a referendum.\u201d", "description": "David Cameron has hit out at Boris Johnson and his Brexit strategy, saying the prime minister was wrong to suspend parliament and warning that a no-deal Brexit would be a \u201cbad outcome\u201d.
