For the first time, Belgium has managed to be interesting without getting invaded by Germany or abusing an African colony.\n\nWhat\u2019s so interesting? In short: Belgium is coming apart at the seams. For roughly 120 days, its 11 political parties have been unable to form a national government because the Dutch-speaking regions want greater autonomy, or even outright independence.\n\nPrimarily split between Dutch-speaking Flemings and French-speaking Walloons, Belgium was formed as a constitutional monarchy where the non-French speakers were mostly treated as second-class citizens. Even today, 177 years later, there are no national figures or national political parties. Each party represents its own ethnic, linguistic or regional enclave. But, although the Flemish majority is somewhat more prosperous, the Walloons have a perceived stranglehold on Belgian politics. One is tempted to joke that it\u2019s an Iraq with better weather and waffles.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t a mini-Iraq, and not just because they\u2019re not killing one another. It\u2019s more like a mini-European Union. In fact, that\u2019s the one thing everyone can agree on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo country is more invested in the EU experiment than Belgium, whose capital, Brussels, is also the capital of the EU. If Belgium falls to sectarianism, what does that say about prospects for making Europe into a super-Belgium?\n\nBelgium is a \u201claboratory,\u201d says Joelle Milquet, the leader of the French-speaking Humanist Democratic Center party and a defender of both a united Belgium and EU. \u201cIf 10 million people in a developed country do not manage to build a collective project,\u201d she told Britain\u2019s Telegraph newspaper, \u201cthat would signal the bankruptcy of what one tries to build at the European and even international level.\u201d Paul Belien, a Flemish writer who favors an independent Flanders, agrees. \u201cFor me, the Belgian and EU flags are basically the same. They are a denial of identity.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the hilarious irony of all this: The European Union is in effect subsidizing nationalism in Belgium and across the Continent. As the EU assumes more of the responsibilities of states -- regulations, the economy, currency, possibly even defense -- the cost of independence becomes lower.\n\nLook at Scotland. The Scots are moving, perhaps inexorably, toward national independence from Britain. A referendum on breaking away is scheduled for 2010 and seems likely to pass. And why not? Scotland didn\u2019t formally become part of Britain until 1707, when it caved in to English threats to its trade and the free movement of people across the border. Now, thanks to the EU, such threats are illegal. And it\u2019s hardly likely that England would declare war on secessionist Scotland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA similar process is underway in Kosovo, which wants to break from Serbia (the U.S. backs that idea) and get EU candidacy like Croatia and Macedonia. The Basques in Spain aren\u2019t far behind. In the past, ethnic enclaves probably couldn\u2019t make it on their own. But now the EU provides a safety net.\n\nThe catch-22 is delightful. By scaling back the job description of a nation-state to a few ceremonial duties, ethnic minorities see fewer risks and a lot more rewards in breaking away. Countries such as Slovakia get to trade on their votes in the EU and the U.N. They get their own anthems and sports teams and to teach their own language and culture. It\u2019s like a McDonald\u2019s franchise. Sure, you man the register and keep the bathrooms clean, but the folks at corporate HQ do the heavy lifting. That\u2019s why the Basques, Scots and Flemings are looking to open their own franchises. The question is whether the nationalist hunger of such McNations can be satisfied by just the symbolism of autonomy.\n\nThis points to why I take so much pleasure in the troubles in Brussels. The EU always made the most sense to Belgians, who have a very weak national identity. The myth was that everyone felt the same way.\n\nIndeed, the EU project has always been predicated on self-serving myths. Another is the idea that with greater \u201cunderstanding\u201d comes greater peace and comity. The Walloons and the Flemings understand each other; they just don\u2019t like each other very much.\n\nBut what I really like about the Belgian crisis is that it puts a dent in the myth that Europe represents some enlightened new model exportable to the rest of the globe. After World War II and the Holocaust, a generation of diplomats and intellectuals predicted that nationality, religion and culture would matter less in the New Europe. But wishing didn\u2019t make it so. Obviously, nobody wants the bloody nationalism of early 20th century Europe. But it\u2019s nonetheless gratifying that the even on the EU\u2019s Brussels campus, life resists the blueprints of the bureaucrats.\n\njgoldberg@latimescolumnists.com", "description": "You probably don't realize it, but we are living in an unprecedented historical moment.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg Is A Fellow At The American Enterprise Institute.
