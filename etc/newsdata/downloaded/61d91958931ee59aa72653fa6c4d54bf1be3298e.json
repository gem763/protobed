I\u2019m 30 and have slept with over 100 men and had six relationships, three of which were long-term.\n\nI\u2019ve been told by some people that my (healthy) sexual appetite somehow makes me less worthy of love. When I was younger, I believed them \u2013 and even referred to myself as the \u2018type of woman\u2019 men wanted to sleep with, but not date. Thankfully, now I\u2019m older, I understand what utter bulls**t that is.\n\nIf anything, my vast experience has taught me a lot about true love and what I want from a partner.\n\nCasual sex without mutual respect and some degree of intellectual interest isn\u2019t fun anymore (Picture: Almara Abgarian)\n\nIn my early 20s, I would \u2018fall\u2019 for pretty much any man I had sex with. I confused temporary affection and drunken one-night stand cuddles with love, because I hadn\u2019t yet experienced the real earth-shattering kind that makes you feel safe, secure and cared for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA great casual shag was also like a drug. It gave me an amazing high, but if I did it for the wrong reasons \u2013 validation, for instance \u2013 I suffered through a post-sex comedown soon after.\n\nBeing a hopeless romantic at heart (something I hate to admit) also meant I kept trying to make it work with men I wasn\u2019t all that interested in. Like Danny*, a former colleague with whom I had a brief fling years ago. He was a d*ck \u2013 which is ironic considering he had a very small penis \u2013 and the sex was average, but I spent months pining over him because I wanted our connection to mean more than it did.\n\nOr Jay*, who I dated for five months, despite the fact I knew we weren\u2019t compatible. We had nothing in common, he lived in a different city and he also had children \u2013 which wasn\u2019t necessarily a deal-breaker, but slightly awkward, given I don\u2019t want kids.\n\nI confused temporary affection and drunken one-night stand cuddles with love, because I hadn\u2019t yet experienced the real earth-shattering kind that makes you feel safe, secure and cared for.\n\nEverything changed when I was 24 and met a man who loved me so deeply and intensely that I finally understood what I\u2019d been missing out on. Many of the men from my past didn\u2019t care about who I was or what I had to say, and here was a man who loved my mind more than my body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was the first time in my life I felt truly safe. He became my best friend during that time and I knew that he would be there for me no matter what.\n\nUnfortunately the relationship didn\u2019t work out, but it had a snowball effect. As I got older, my antipathy towards casual partners only intensified.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with f***ing around if that\u2019s your jam but the appeal has worn thin for me over the years.\n\nMy vast experience has taught me a lot about true love and what I want from a partner (Picture: Almara Abgarian)\n\nA few months ago I decided to put it to the test. I jumped onto Tinder and within 10 minutes had organised a \u2018cuddle and wine\u2019 date with a man who lived around the corner from my flat.\n\nThe moment he walked in, I could tell exactly how this would play out. He kissed me and moved onto the sofa where he instructed me to \u2018come closer\u2019, while I kept trying to have a conversation with him. What a fool I was, for thinking we might actually talk for a few minutes before taking our clothes off.\n\nThroughout the 15 minutes we spent together (yes, really), all I could think was how I wished he would give me some intellectual stimulation, and how the fact he didn\u2019t want to get to know my amazing mind was off-putting. We didn\u2019t have sex, but fooled around (I still wanted to get something from my experiment and an orgasm is always fun).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was completely consensual but the experience cemented what I\u2019d suspected for some time \u2013 that, for me, casual sex without mutual respect and some degree of intellectual interest isn\u2019t fun anymore \u2013 and it isn\u2019t what I\u2019m looking for.\n\nThe idea of taking a guy home from a bar or organising a night of Netflix and Chill through a dating app, not knowing if he\u2019ll be good (or last through the performance long enough to give me an orgasm) now fills me with boredom.\n\nHaving lots of sexual partners has taught me that I\u2019m comfortable with who I am and unwilling to compromise on how I should be treated. And in turn, that has revealed what true love really means for me: meeting my equal, a person who stimulates my mind and body and, above all, respects me.\n\nMake no mistake, sex still ranks very high on my list of requirements, but not because I\u2019m dying for someone to get me off. I can do that on my own.\n\nSex is a way to connect with someone you love on a different level. It\u2019s by no means everything but I\u2019ve realised that sharing my bed, and my heart, with someone who isn\u2019t bothered about anything beyond my vagina isn\u2019t a turn-on anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not saying that casual sex is off the table forever \u2013 my urge to get freaky is still very much alive, and I wouldn\u2019t deny myself if that\u2019s what I choose in the future.\n\nBut right now I want more. So, when I go on a date and the other person inevitably asks what I\u2019m \u2018looking for\u2019 \u2013 to which, by the way, there is no good answer \u2013 I try my best to tell the truth: love.\n\nWrite for Love, Or Something Like It Love, Or Something Like It is a brand new series for Metro.co.uk, published every Saturday.
