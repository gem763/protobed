It\u2019s not the right banana! It has no head!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was so funny,\u201d Hailey says, in a really, really bored voice, the subtext of which could well be, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we scuba diving in the Galapagos, Justin? Why are we in the kitchen when we could be on a private jet?\u201d\n\nThe dissemination of the mean-spirited footage on social media was particularly ill-advised as Bieber\u2014who, let us not forget, has spent much of the past two years busily trying to reinvent himself as a spiritually-sound member of the Hillsong church\u2014was forced to make a humiliating apology to Taylor Swift in June after an old video of him and manager Scooter Braun was reposted by Taylor, in which they are shown mocking Taylor in bro-tastic style with noted Taylor-troll Kanye West.\n\nIn a rare show of maturity and accountability, Bieber sort-of apologized, calling the video, accurately, \u201cdistasteful and insensitive\u201d adding, \u201cAt the time I thought it was funny.\u201d\n\nNow, it seems, the spiritual moment has passed and he\u2019s back to trolling Taylor.\n\nThis time, the sort-of apology, when it came, was made by his wife who made a lamentable sorry-not-sorry to offended fans: \u201cListen. I think it\u2019s awesome how passionate you are and how hard you ride for someone you\u2019re a fan of, it\u2019s beautiful how dedicated you are. If there\u2019s something I did to personally hurt you or offend you I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not my intention to upset you by any means.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d she continued (proving the wisdom of the old adage that everything before the but is bullshit), \u201cbeing angry at someone you don\u2019t know does nothing for you. I know cause I been there \u2026 all it\u2019s gonna do is make you miserable. Don\u2019t let ME of all people get you feeling that way. Trust me, I\u2019m not worth the energy, nobody should be worth that energy!\u201d\n\nMay we make a suggestion of our own, Mr and Mrs Bieber?\n\nTwo words: Galapagos.
