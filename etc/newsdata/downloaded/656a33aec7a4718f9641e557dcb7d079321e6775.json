It is specifically inspired by the honeymoon lodge, pictured\n\nOwner Catt Kaspar, 40, a homeopath from Edinburgh, purchased the lodge in February 2017 before embarking on her long and extensive labour of love for the property.\n\nAs guests step inside the fascinating lodge they are met with the sound of the Outlander theme song that plays from inside a hidden oak-covered Alexa device sitting on top of a barrel in the living room.\n\nOwner Catt said: \u2018There is a labour of love. I am fascinated by Scottish history. I think Edinburgh's buildings have seen better days but there is a revival on interest.\n\n\u2018Because of the popularity of Outlander people became interested in the history of the Jacobean era and this very romanticised way of living but that wasn\u2019t really the reason why I refurbished it.\n\n\u2018I have read the Outlander books and when the series came through I thought it's so nice to see it again and it was so well done and was in a way the last push that I needed to move to Scotland.\n\n'I moved because of the Outlander series.\u2019\n\nThe Scottish TV series, based on the books by author Diana Gabaldon, follows the journey of married nurse Claire Randall as she travels back in time to 1743 Scotland and encounters Highland warrior Jamie Fraser.\n\nThe charming Airbnb lodge

family in London and move to the magical city of Edinburgh.\n\nShe said: \u2018Scotland has always been a country I always loved.\n\n\u2018Scotland is this fantastic place of fantasy and people come to Scotland they fall in love with it, they fall in love with each, they fall in love with the magic of it and if you have the opportunity to stay in a place that enhances those feelings then the whole experience becomes even more magical.\n\n\u2018It inspires you to follow your heart or your dreams in a way and Brexit was the economic factor that made me think in the long run Scotland would be a reasonable place to raise children.\u2019\n\nAs guests step inside the lodge they are met with the sound of the Outlander theme song that plays from inside a oak-covered Alexa device\n\nThe themed lodge features a double bed that comes with comfortable beddinfg and silk cushions\n\nThe bedroom, which is hidden from view behind red curtains, also features electrical lights and an area where guests can charge their phones\n\nThe fascinating lodge has within its walls an array of antiques sourced especially for the flat, from the books on the shelves to the cutlery.\n\nThe room itself is inspired by one of Catt\u2019s favourite episode of the first series- the night of Jamie and Claire's wedding.\n\nCatt said: \u2018They spend long hours talking and drinking and it is that scene that inspired this flat because when I came in the first time I said well it looks exactly like that inn.\n\n'Everything has a little bit of Scottish history in it so the sofa we have is a Victorian sofa, the chairs are Jacobean chairs that I got in an auction in Scotland and the sword is a replica too.\u2019\n\nAs guests step through the front doors they are met with a Jacobean style living room from the 1800s.\n\nThe entire kitchen was manufactured by hand and an artisan joiner took ideas from that period in order to replicate a Jacobean style cooking area\n\nThe kitchen features an antique oak worktop, copper details and a hammered copper sink which was manufactured by hand\n\nOn the top of the fireplace lie replica stag antlers which were purchased by Catt\u2019s interior

the dining table that are Jacobean original chairs.\n\nCatt said: \u2018We researched what kind of books were in fashion in the 1700s and we tried to source those from the antique book shop in Scotland to try and get as close to possible to the Scottish reality in that sense.\n\n\u2018So it was a labour of love, something that we like very much to do but certainly not anything anyone would do for economical purpose.\n\n\u2018It feels like you are in the film set.'\n\nShe added: 'Scotland is this fantastic place of fantasy and people come to Scotland they fall in love with it, they fall
