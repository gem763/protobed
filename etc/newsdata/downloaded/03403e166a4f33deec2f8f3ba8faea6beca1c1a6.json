I felt I was less a human being for having seen it, and today that's an unfortunate message.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Sylvester Stallone said he's 'furious' that he's never seen any licensing revenue from the 'Rocky' franchise\n\n\"Rambo: Last Blood\" follows Stallone's Rambo as he crosses the US-Mexico border to save a kidnapped girl. The movie has received a 28% Rotten Tomatoes critic score. The Guardian called it a \"massively enlarged prostate of a film.\"\n\n\"In 2019's hypersensitive cultural environment, the depiction of murderous Mexican crime bosses and their cowering sex slaves encountering a literal white savior doesn't go down so easy,\" Indiewire wrote.\n\nThe movie earned $18.8 million in its domestic debut over the weekend, coming in third place behind fellow newcomers \"Downtown Abbey\" ($31 million) and Brad Pitt's sci-fi drama \"Ad Astra\" ($19 million). The last movie in the franchise, 2008's \"Rambo,\" made $22.8 million (after adjusting for inflation) in its debut.\n\nWith a $50 million budget, it's hard to say right now whether \"Last Blood\" will turn out to be a success. But audiences who have seen it have given the movie more approval than Morrell or film critics.\n\nIt has an 84% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes based on nearly 3,000 user ratings and a B rating on Cinemascore, which surveys audiences on a movie's opening night.\n\nMorrell added that the movie \"assumes the audience is familiar with Rambo's background, whereas anyone under 40 will wonder what on Earth is going on with those tunnels.\"\n\n\"From multiple perspectives, this film fails miserably,\" Morrell told Newsweek. \"The best I can say is that the first two minutes were promising.\"", "description": "David Morrell, author of the book that introduced the Rambo character, 'First Blood,' had some harsh words for the final movie in the franchise.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8a1ffa2e22af3d5904a93c-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
