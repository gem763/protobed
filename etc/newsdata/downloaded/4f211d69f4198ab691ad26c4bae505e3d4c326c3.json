Bow down, bow down,\u201d she said.\n\n\"Who is the real queen?\"@joannamma calls for the strawweight champ to \"bow down\" \ud83d\udc51 #UFCTampapic.twitter.com/vyrbOTeJD8 \u2014 ESPN MMA (@espnmma) October 13, 2019\n\nJedrzejczyk\u2019s foot showed signs of heavy swelling in the final round, and the Pole said she had broken it amid the kicking barrage she directed at Waterson.\n\n\u201cI got a broken foot in the end of the second round, beginning of the third. It was hard, but it was an honor to headline a show here in Tampa,\u201d she said.\n\nZhang Weili vs. Joanna Jedrzejczyk is the fight to make.
