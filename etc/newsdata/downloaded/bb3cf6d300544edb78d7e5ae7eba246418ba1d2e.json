It earlier fell to as low as $57.41.\n\nrose by 14 cents, or 0.2%, to $64.42.\n\nTop oil exporter Saudi Arabia said it expected to restore as soon as next week production lost from the Sept. 14 attack on its Abqaiq crude processing facility that turned out 5.7 million barrels per day. Saudi Arabia has already restored around 75% of output from the plant, Reuters reported.\n\nCrude prices were also weakened by a survey showing eurozone business growth stalled this month, dragged down by shrinking activity in Germany, where a recession deepened unexpectedly.\n\nBut traders said the market recovered on the notion that this week\u2019s U.N. general assembly might not produce any outcome that will defuse tensions in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThe UN general assembly is under way, and that will print many geopolitical headlines,\u201d said Olivier Jakob, head of oil risk consultancy Petromax.\n\n\u201cIf Trump and Rouhani are not able to make some progress then we can expect Iran to continue its policy of maximum resistance and this will translate in more attacks,\u201d he added, referring to efforts by the U.S. president to reach out to his Iranian counterpart for talks.\n\nIn a surprising development on Monday, Rouhani said that he will unveil a peace plan for the Middle East at the U.N. assembly.\n\n\"This year we will present a plan to the world at the United Nations that the Islamic Republic of Iran in cooperation with the countries of the region can create security for the Persian Gulf and the Oman Sea with the help of the countries of the region,\" he said on his website, without providing further details.\n\nIn an apparent gesture of goodwill, Iran also reportedly released a British-flagged tanker, the \u201cStena Impero\u201d, that it seized in July.\n\nBut at the same time, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif reiterated his caution that Iran will resort to an \u201call-out war\u201d if it is targeted by the United States or Saudi Arabia over the Saudi attack. Yemen-based Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, but the U.S. has accused Iran, which has denied the charge.", "description": "Oil Rises Slightly as Geopolitical Fears Offset Saudi Supply Assurance", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC1A050_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
