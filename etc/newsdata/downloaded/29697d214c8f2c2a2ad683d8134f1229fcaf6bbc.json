It was a horrific time for us.\n\n\u201cTh\u00e9odore spent two weeks in PICU and was hooked up to lots of wires so we couldn\u2019t hold him.\n\n\"He had fluid on his lungs along with a number of other post-op complications, and at one point we were told we should prepare for the worst.\u201d\n\nIncredibly, the youngster, who was treated at Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital, suddenly began breathing on his own.\n\nAmanda, from Hither Green, south east London, added: \u201cTh\u00e9odore really is our determined little Superbaby who has fought his way through.\u201d\n\nHis dad Alex, 34, who has Superman t-shirts, pajamas and posters, pushed for his son to be named after Clark Kent, the hero's alias.\n\nAnd Th\u00e9odore has since proved he is every bit as strong as the Man of Steel - as he is now starting to walk and will celebrate his first birthday next month.\n\nAmanda, a lawyer said: \u201cWe are travelling to Scotland and throwing a family party. It\u2019s amazing - though I am slightly anxious about the day as it will bring everything back.\u201d\n\nThe parents are taking on challenges to raise money for Evelina London, with hospitality boss Alex set to run the London Marathon in April.\n\nAmanda - who ran a half marathon with Th\u00e9odore\u2019s intensive care consultant, Dr Shelley Riphagen this month - explained: \u201cWe go back to Evelina London quite often and each visit reminds us how lucky we are to have Th\u00e9odore with us here today.\u201d\n\nFunds raised by Team Theo will be split between the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit and Cardiology Kids, which aims to raise \u00a3150,000 for the Cardiology Team as a legacy of the 150th birthday of Evelina London.\n\nTo support the family\u2019s fundraising, click here .", "description": "Th\u00e9odore Clark Chamming\u2019s beat the odds to survive after open heart surgery at eight hours old - and now his family are fundraising for the children's hospital that saved his life", "authors": ["Amy Sharpe"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20729087.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-Thodore-Chammings-_5066JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
