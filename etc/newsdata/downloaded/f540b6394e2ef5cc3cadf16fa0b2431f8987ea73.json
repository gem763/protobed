Provided, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nLEBANON - Brooke Skylar Richardson sobbed.\n\nAfter what her lawyers described as a two-year \"nightmare,\" she was found not guilty on Thursday of the most serious charges against her.\n\nA sheriff's deputy handcuffed Richardson and led her out of the courtroom. She walked past the investigator who had interrogated her more than two years ago - an interrogation that would be key to the nationally watched case that would follow.\n\nShe was going to jail, but only for a night. Her lawyers don't expect her to serve any jail time.\n\nRichardson, 20,was accused of deliberately killing her newborn child in 2017 and burying the girl in her backyard. After little more than four hours of deliberation, a jury cleared her of that.\n\nBrooke Skylar Richardson was found not guilty of aggravated murder, involuntary manslaughter and child endangering, Thursday, Sept. 12, 2019, in Warren County Judge Donald Oda's II courtroom at Warren County Common Pleas Court in Lebanon, Ohio. She was found guilty in connection with abuse of a corpse. (Photo: Kareem Elgazzar/The Enquirer)\n\nNeither Richardson nor her family spoke to reporters while leaving the courthouse.\n\nHer attorneys said she had a stillbirth when she was 18 and didn't know what else to do except bury the child.\n\nRichardson had been charged with aggravated murder, involuntary manslaughter, child endangerment, tampering with evidence and gross abuse of a corpse. She was facing the potential of life in prison.\n\nA judge dismissed the tampering with evidence charge earlier this week. A jury found her not guilty of all the charges except for gross abuse of a corpse, the lowest level of felony in Ohio.\n\nHer sentencing is scheduled for Friday morning.\n\nAfter the verdict, Richardson's attorneys told reporters they don't expect her to serve any jail time.\n\n\"She was living under a dark cloud for the past two years, frankly a nightmare,\" Charlie H. Rittgers said.\n\nHe also raised his voice, calling the national news coverage of the case \"bull----.\"\n\n\"I'm emotionally raw right now,\" Rittgers said. \"I'm so pissed off she was charged.\"\n\nThe attorney's wife signaled to him through a crowd of television cameras and reporters with microphones. She wanted him to calm down.\n\nNear the beginning of the trial, Rittgers missed a day of testimony because of a heart issue, his son said.\n\nRichardson could walk away from this trial Friday. Her gross abuse of a corpse conviction could be sealed after three years, but her lawyers said there is concern she will never be able to get away from this due to the media attention.\n\nLawyer Charles M. Rittgers, the son of Charles H., said he's learned Richardson has a \"kind soul\" after she took a job with his firm. He said she plans to continue school.\n\n\"She can work at our office as long as she wants,\" he said.\n\nProsecutor: 'I\u2019m not going to apologize'\n\nThe Warren County Prosecutor David Fornshell told the press he still believes Richardson took her daughter's life.\n\nWhen he was asked if he thought he owned Richardson an apology for publicizing allegations she burned her baby when an expert later recanted her opinion, Fornshell said, \"I'm not going to apologize.\"\n\nHe faced numerous questions about whether he overcharged Richardson.\n\n\"We owed it to that little girl,\" he said in the press conference after the trial. \"It had to be tried.\"\n\nHe said the case was \"extraordinarily difficult case.\" Fornshell said his team was ultimately unable to prove a medical cause of death.\n\n\u201cThat probably played a major factor in the outcome we saw today,\u201d he said.\n\nA cheerleader finds herself pregnant\n\nRichardson's trial began on Sept. 3. But what she saw as her nightmare really began in 2017.\n\nThe 18-year-old cheerleader was in love with her boyfriend and planning to go the University of Cincinnati in the fall. Then, she found out she was pregnant.\n\nAnd her boyfriend wasn't the father.\n\nProsecutors said her perfect life was in jeopardy. So she did whatever she could to keep it a secret.\n\nFor almost two weeks, jurors heard conflicting testimony, shocking texts and a disputed confession.\n\nJurors had to decide whether Richardson was a naive, scared and easily manipulated young woman who had a stillbirth and was coerced into confessing to murder \u2013 or someone who killed her child because she was obsessed with external appearances.\n\n\"Unwanted,\" said Assistant Warren County Prosecutor Julie Kraft during closing arguments on Thursday. \"That's what Brooke Richardson's daughter was.\"\n\nRichardson's attorneys said her confession to police was coerced. They said investigators relied on scientific evidence that was proven false to bully Richardson.\n\nInitially, a forensic pathologist told authorities the baby was burned. The pathologist later recanted that opinion. Everyone who testified during the trial agreed there was no physical evidence the baby was burned.\n\nRichardson told police she tried to cremate her child with a lighter.\n\n\"It's impossible,\" said Charlie M. Rittgers before jurors began deliberating.\n\nDuring closing arguments, Rittgers told jurors about his own wife's pregnancy. He said he was scared and didn't know what the child was supposed to look like \u2013 and he wasn't 18.\n\nAnd he didn't suffer from an eating disorder like Richardson did.\n\nDefense attorney Charles M. Rittgers delivers his closing statement during the trial of Brooke \"Skylar\" Richardson at Warren County Common Pleas Court Thursday, September 12, 2019. The 20-year-old is accused of killing and burying her baby in the backyard of her Carlisle home. Richardson was charged with aggravated murder, involuntary manslaughter, gross abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and child endangerment in the death of her newborn infant. The judge dismissed the tampering with evidence charge Monday after arguments from both sides. She faces the possibility of life in prison.

This contributed to a \"personality disorder\" in which she lived to please people and was terrified of rejection.\n\nAfter meals, her friends and classmates testified she would stack plates and silverware. Then, she would grab a napkin and wipe the table clean.\n\nAnd if her food came out wrong, Richardson wouldn't tell anyone. She didn't want to cause problems.\n\nHer attorneys said this is why she confessed to a crime she didn't commit.\n\nCLOSE Video of police interrogation is shown in court during Brooke Skylar Richardson's trial. Police video, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nAssistant Warren County Prosecutor Steve Knippen said Richardson never wanted to have a child. He used text messages to make his final pitch to jurors.\n\n\"My belly is back,\" Knippen told jurors on Thursday, referencing a text Richardson sent on the day she buried her child. \"That belly was her child. That belly was her daughter with fingers and toes and hair on her head. A child she tossed in the dirt.\"\n\nWhen investigators recovered the child, buried near the treeline and marked with a flower pot Richardson could see from her window, there was nothing left but bones.\n\nProsecutors called it the perfect crime. Her attorneys called it a botched investigation into a troubled teen.\n\nIn her police interview, Richardson told police what they wanted to hear, her attorney said. They said things and she repeated them, all while a female detective held her hand.\n\nThey told Richardson she wasn't in trouble. But they told her they knew she wasn't telling them everything.\n\nThey told Richardson the child, whom she named Annabelle, was being poked and prodded by doctors. They knew her family wanted to have a proper burial.\n\nAnd they told Richardson she needed to tell the truth if she ever wanted to get her child back.\n\n\"Annabelle has never been returned to her family,\" Rittgers said in court.\n\nAfter the verdict, standing in the hallway, Rittgers smiled. He said the family had already bought a burial plot for Annabelle.\n\nHe said he was hopeful Richardson would now get her back.\n\nHowever, Fornshell said the remains might not go back to the Richardson family.\n\n\"There's a father involved here,\" the prosecutor said clarifying that the father is not charged with gross abuse of a corpse.\n\nFornshell said he expects the father's family to present a victim impact statement at sentencing Friday.\n\nSonia Chopra contributed.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2019/09/12/brooke-skylar-richardson-trial-verdict/2302494001/", "description": "Brooke Skylar Richardson was accused of deliberately killing her newborn child and burying her in the backyard.", "authors": ["Keith Bierygolick", "Cameron Knight", "Published P.M.
