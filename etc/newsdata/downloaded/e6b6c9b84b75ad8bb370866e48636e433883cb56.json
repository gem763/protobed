While the payment is indexed to keep up with inflation, advocates say those minor adjustments are drastically outpaced by the cost of living, forcing recipients to live in financial desperation.\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s reputation as a caring and liveable nation is not enhanced in circumstances where many perceive the safety net to be set at a very low level,\u201d the submission states.\n\nThe submission states raising the rate would not only help people keep a roof over their heads, but would allow them to lower \u201chis or her level of concern about the material needs of the immediate family, better enabling the individual to concentrate on achieving high quality interactions in pursuit of a new job.\u201d\n\nTo really hammer home the fact that yes, this is a good idea, KPMG said raising the rate by $100 a week would still make it \u201cfinancially worthwhile for an individual to accept minimum-wage employment\u201d while easing some of the harsher realities of unemployment.\n\nAvoiding this same problem occurring again could be solved by tying the payment to at least half of the national minimum wage, the submission states.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time KPMG has backed the idea of raising Newstart, and they\u2019re not the only Big Four member to do so, either.\n\nLast year, a Deloitte review said a $75-a-week bump would cost the economy $3.3b annually, but would see even more money flowing around the economy. That\u2019s something the government pretty desperately needs.\n\nThe Senate Committee review comes amid an increased focus on the payment. In case you missed it, even National Party MP Barnaby Joyce has defied the Coalition line on the matter, calling for a Newstart hike.\n\nThe Senate Committee will have its first public hearing in Canberra on Wednesday, but you can check out some submissions here.", "description": "In a Senate Committee submission, the firm calls for Newstart to be raised to $370 weekly.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/link-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
