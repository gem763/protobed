These included crime data from the Federal Bureau of Investigations\u2019 National Incident Based Reporting System; pollution data from the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Air Quality System network of monitors and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hazard Mapping System; and weather data from Oregon State University\u2019s PRISM Climate Group.\n\nThe air quality was measured for the amount of PM 2.5, meaning pollutant particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers, and ozone, a gas formed when sunlight reacts with pollutants emitted by various sources including factories, power plants and cars.\n\nOne caveat: The study looked only at counties where daily data could be found or reliably calculated. This constituted a very broad sample \u2014 397 counties, covering 28% of the U.S. population \u2014 but by no means all of the country, and no counties in, say, New York or California.\n\nThe researchers were able to compare short-term, and even daily, changes in pollution by county with the incidence of crime.\n\n\u201cA 10% increase in same-day exposure to PM 2.5 is associated with an 0.14% increase in crimes, nearly all of which is driven by increases in assaults, which are indicative of aggressive behavior,\u201d the researchers found. \u201cA 10% increase in same-day exposure to ozone is associated with a 0.3% increase in violent crime or a 0.35% increase in assaults.\u201d\n\nPollution outside drives violence both inside and outside the home, they add. \u201c[C]hanges in outdoor PM 2.5 and ozone affect indoor behavior, and in particular, likely impact domestic violence,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe effects were greater at low temperatures, they said. And they kicked in well below the EPA\u2019s current air quality standards.\n\nThe direct causes of this are not fully known, they said. The irritation from pollution causes \u201csystemic inflammation\u201d and \u201ccellular oxidative stress,\u201d they noted \u2014 but the mechanisms are \u201cnot well understood,\u201d they added, and they couldn\u2019t directly identify the physiological pathways behind their results.\n\nThe data show a rise in violent crimes, including those driven by impulsive behavior, but not a rise in property crimes, they said.\n\nThis study is far from the first to find a link between air quality and other social outcomes. Perhaps the most notable study has been the so-called lead crime hypothesis, which argues that the surge in crime rates in U.S. cities from the 1960s to the early 1990s was a result of children growing up breathing lead from car exhausts.\n\nThe crime rates apparently surged about 20 years after car exhausts took off in the 1940s, and started falling about 20 years after the introduction of unleaded gasoline in the 1970s. Lead is known to have harmful effects on children. The hypothesis, however, is not without its critics.\n\nThe latest study also follows a paper published last year by the Institute of Labor Economics that found \u201celevated levels of air pollution have a positive and statistically significant impact on overall crime,\u201d with stronger effects found for less-severe crimes. A study three years ago by Britain\u2019s Spatial Economics Research Center found a link between air quality and poverty dating back to the industrial revolution.\n\nOther researchers last year published findings connecting pollution and crime rates, arguing that dirtier air raised anxiety levels.", "description": "\u2018The results suggest that a 10% reduction in daily [pollutants] and ozone could save $1.4 billion in crime costs a year.\u2019", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS804_pdaren_ZG_20191007151655.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
