Eric Gripp tweeted. Another officer was admitted for injuries \"sustained in a vehicle crash related to the incident,\" he said.\n\nThe gunman, whose name has not been released by law enforcement, was taken to Temple University Hospital for treatment related to the teargas, police said.\n\n\"We are very, very lucky with six police officers shot in one incident ... It is nothing short of astounding that ... we didn't have more of a tragedy,\" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross Jr. told reporters, describing the situation as \"volatile.\"\n\nResidents were lingering in the early evening around the perimeter of the crime scene, an area that is typically busy with shoppers, diners and people returning home from work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a war zone,\u201d Marica Bing said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really scary that this is going on in a regular residential area,\u201d Asya Richardson added.\n\nOn her way home from work, Kiersten Gray saw helicopters and police cars and decided to stop at the scene.\n\n\u201cThis is absolutely insane,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Rysheana Hightower, Wednesday's situation was a terrible reminder: Her brother, Rashid, was shot and killed in the area 14 years ago, she said.\n\n\u201cThe sickness of some of the individuals in the world we live in,\u201d she said. \u201cThe world is a sad place.\u201d\n\nNearby Temple University tweeted updates on the situation, instructing students to seek shelter. Their Health Sciences Center campus was briefly on lockdown.\n\nSophie Nicholas, a Temple student who lives near the scene, said she was visiting Aurora, Colorado, on the same day in 2012 that a gunman opened fire in a movie theater, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others.\n\n\u201cWhy is this still happening?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat was so many years ago.\"\n\nMayor Jim Kenney expressed the same to reporters on Wednesday night: \"It's disgusting. We have to do something about it.\"\n\nWhen gunfire began in the late afternoon, officers at the scene were told to stay back after at least two officers became trapped inside the home with the shooter, according to scanner audio.\n\n\u201cWe are pinned down in the second floor with three individuals handcuffed,\u201d one officer said calmly amidst the chaotic calls. \u201cYou can hear the male moving down stairs on the first floor.\u201d\n\nDuring another round of gunfire, one officer can be heard saying, \"The male is reloading, the male is reloading, shots fired inside.\"\n\nAnother officer says, \u201cThat male has a long gun! That male has a long gun!\u201d\n\nThis is the second major police shooting this week. Three California Highway Patrol officers were shot, one fatally, on Monday after a motorist opened fire during a traffic stop near Interstate 215 in Riverside.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "description": "All six officers who were shot were transported to local hospitals but later released, Philadelphia police Sgt.
