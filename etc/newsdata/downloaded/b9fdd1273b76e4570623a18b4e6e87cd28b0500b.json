However, they talk every day,\u201d she told Fox 59.\n\nIn their clarification, the school said a group of fifth-grade teachers wrote the letter with the intention of protecting students\u2019 feelings, encouraging developmentally appropriate relationships and avoiding distractions during class time.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, the phrases, \u2018zero dating policy\u2019 and the request to take Tuesday and Wednesday to \u2018end\u2019 relationships misrepresented the intentions of the teachers,\" the school said, according to WDRB. \"While the team of teachers were trying to protect students, the wording is what caused alarm.\u201d\n\nThe school said the letter had not been reviewed by the principal or district officials.\n\nBower wrote on Facebook that she has never had a problem with the school before.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I just think boundaries were crossed with telling my child he had to end his relationship by a certain date without addressing anything with me first,\" she wrote.", "description": "An Indiana elementary school reversed a fifth-grade\u00a0\u201czero dating policy\u201d Thursday after some parents expressed concern over the school regulating their children's relationships.", "authors": ["Brie Stimson"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/middle-school-classroom-iStock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
