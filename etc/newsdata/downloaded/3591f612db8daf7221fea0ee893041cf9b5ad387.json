Open to boys between the ages of 16 and 19, it gives students a formal education -- either through A Level exams or vocational diplomas -- on top of 10-12 hours of American football training each week.\n\nThe aim is not to mass produce overseas stars, but rather, as NFL UK managing director Alistair Kirkwood explains, to \"build out well-rounded individuals that can contribute to society and become more employable.\"\n\nThe elite few, says Kirkwood, will go on to play college football -- and beyond -- in the States, but just being accepted into the Academy is tricky enough. Of the 1500 applicants for the inaugural year, only 80, following rigorous trials, were offered places to start in September, subject to academic results.\n\nCreating opportunity\n\nFor those selected -- many of whom have been raised in socially deprived areas -- the impact could be life-changing. It's something that hasn't escaped Efe Obada, the Carolina Panthers' defensive end who was raised in London.\n\n\"[When I was younger] youth clubs were shutting down, gang culture was increasing, funding for everything was getting shut down, and there weren't that many opportunities,\" Obada tells CNN Sport at a trial day for students hopeful of being accepted into the Academy.\n\n\"Growing up I never had role models, I never had opportunities like this so to be a part of it, to be able to think I'm even looked up to as a role model is amazing and it's not something I take very lightly.\n\n\"I'm from a similar background to these kids and I'm relating whatever knowledge I can impart. Whatever I wish someone said to me when I was their age or in that situation, then I'm going to try and do that.\"\n\nObada's route to the NFL was unconventional, to say the least. Born in Nigeria, he moved to the Netherlands with his mother and sister. At the age of 10, he and his sister were brought to England by a stranger but abandoned on the streets of east London.\n\nJUST WATCHED Rugby to NFL: Christian Scotland-Williamson Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rugby to NFL: Christian Scotland-Williamson 03:27\n\nFrom there, Obada moved between various foster homes in troubled circumstances. Yet it was when he started to train with professional American football outfit London Warriors that he found salvation and a stepping stone into the sport.\n\n\"I see the NFL having an impact in my community as well. When I was growing up living in Stockwell we had [Premier League side] Fulham that used to hold Saturday trials for people and it was the thing,\" continues Obada.\n\n\"Everyone that I knew would talk about it: 'Oh, every Saturday we've got to go Fulham, we've got to go to this place, we've got to go to Larkhall Park because Fulham's coming.' But now the NFL's taking an interest. It's going to definitely help the kids out. They just want to be a part of something.\"\n\nFollowing the first intake this year, the Academy hopes to increase to 150 in the second year and then introduce a separate pathway for girls in the third. Recent applicants came largely from London and the UK, but a few traveled from Europe to take part in trials.\n\n\"Many kids are part of their environment and have limited opportunities,\" says Kirkwood. \"This is intended to provide structure and discipline and teach resiliency and the importance of teamwork.\n\n\"There might be a small handful that end up being athletically talented enough to then go the whole way into the NFL, but that's a bonus, that's not the reason for doing it.\"\n\nShowcasing speed\n\nTottenham Hotspur's new, 62,000-seat stadium in north London provided a glamorous backdrop for the final round of trials at the start of July. Hopefuls underwent the same tests used in the NFL scouting system -- the 40-yard dash, broad jump, vertical jump, and an agility drill.\n\nThere was no shortage of athletic prowess on display. Two trialists, for example, clocked 4.5 seconds for the 40-yard dash -- a time not dissimilar to those recorded by NFL running backs and wide receivers.\n\n\"I said to the kids that ultimately the day was about performance,\" Christian Wade , an England-capped former rugby player who has earned a place on the Buffalo Bills' practice squad, tells CNN Sport.\n\n\"Just going out there and giving it everything.\"\n\nWade left a successful rugby career late last year and knows how difficult it can be to walk into a new sport from scratch. Like other Brits before him , he had never played a game of American football before switching codes.\n\nPhotos: Rugby and NFL: It's complicated...
