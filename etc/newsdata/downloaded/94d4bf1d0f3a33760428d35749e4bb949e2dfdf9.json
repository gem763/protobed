Erdogan has warned that Turkey will resume the assault when the deadline expires on Tuesday if the SDF had not pulled back from the safe zone area.\n\n\"We don't have any more fighters in the city,\" SDF spokesman Kino Gabriel said, referring to Ras al Ain. His comments came after Ankara said dozens of vehicles had entered and left Ras al Ain, which is largely surrounded by Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies, over the weekend.\n\nRebel spokesman Major Youssef Hamoud told Reuters that the SDF had \"not yet completely\" pulled out of Ras al Ain.\n\nTurkey launched its offensive after President Donald Trump announced he was withdrawing U.S. troops from northeastern Syria. His move was criticised in Washington and elsewhere as a betrayal of Kurdish allies who had fought for years alongside U.S. troops against Islamic State.\n\nAnkara is seeking to set up the zone as a buffer as it regards the YPG, the main component of the SDF, as a terrorist group because of its links to Kurdish insurgents in southeast Turkey. The YPG has been a close U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State.\n\nThe U.S. pullout has also created a vacuum that Russia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's most powerful backer, has looked to fill. Syrian and Russian forces, invited by Kurdish authorities, last week entered two border cities of Manbij and Kobani that had been vacated by U.S. troops.\n\nErdogan has backed rebels fighting to oust Assad in the eight-year Syrian conflict, but has said Turkey has no problem with Syrian government forces deploying near the border if the YPG militia are removed.\n\nTURKEY-RUSSIA TALKS\n\nThe issue of YPG withdrawal from Manbij and Kobani would be discussed by Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting in the Russian city of Sochi on Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Sunday.\n\n\"We believe we can reach an agreement with them to work together in the future, just like we have before,\" Cavusoglu said. While Erdogan and Putin have close ties over defence and energy, Moscow has called the Turkish offensive into Syria \"unacceptable\" and said it should be limited.\n\nAlthough the truce held for the first two days of the agreement, Turkey's defence ministry said on Sunday that a Turkish soldier was killed and another was wounded after a YPG attack with anti-tank and light arms hit a reconnaissance and surveillance mission in Tel Abyad, the other town seized by Turkey in its offensive.\n\nIt said Turkish forces had responded to the attack and said the YPG had committed 22 violations of the deal since it begun.\n\nOn Friday the Kurdish militia accused Turkey of violating the pause by shelling civilian areas in the northeast. A senior Turkish official denied the accusations.\n\nSpeaking on ABC's \"This Week\", U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the ceasefire was generally holding. \"Now we need to make sure that the commitments that were made in that statement are honoured,\" Pompeo said.\n\nErdogan said on Saturday Turkey would resume the offensive if the deal faltered, with Turkey insisting it is Washington's duty to ensure the withdrawal of the YPG.\n\nHe also said on Friday that Turkey would set up a dozen observation posts in the \"safe zone\" it wants to form. Turkish forces had already begun establishing two of the posts on Sunday, a witness in the region said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWITHDRAWAL PROCESS", "description": "BEIRUT/ANKARA, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said on Sunday they had withdrawn from the border town of Ras al Ain under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal, but a spokesman for Turkish-backed Syrian rebels said the withdrawal was not yet complete.
