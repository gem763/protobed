There is no permission granted for these forces to stay inside Iraq,\" the statement said.\n\nUS defence chief Mark Esper said he had spoken to his Iraqi counterpart about the plan to shift the more than 700 troops leaving Syria into western Iraq.\n\nA senior US defence official later clarified the situation was still fluid and plans could change.\n\nEsper said on Tuesday that Washington aimed to bring US troops withdrawing from Syria back to the United States.\n\n\"The aim isn't to stay in Iraq interminably. The aim is to pull our soldiers out and eventually get them back home,\" Esper said in front of a Patriot missile battery at the Prince Sultan Air Base near Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nFighting ISIL\n\nOn Monday, a convoy of US troops crossed from Syria into Iraq's northern province of Dohuk, in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region.\n\nIt was unclear whether the US troops will use Iraq as a base to launch ground raids into Syria and carry out air attacks against ISIL fighters.\n\nThe additional US troops would add to the more than 5,000 American forces already based in the country, training Iraqi forces and helping to ensure ISIL does not make a comeback.\n\nIgnominious retreat\n\nUS President Donald Trump has been widely criticised for abandoning the Kurdish Syrian People's Protection Units (YPG) militia - which spearheaded the American-led ground war against ISIL - and allowing Turkey to launch a cross-border military operation against the group.\n\nResidents of a Kurdish-dominated Syrian city pelted US troops with potatoes and shouted expletives at them as they drove through.\n\nA video posted on Monday by the Kurdish news agency showed a convoy of armoured vehicles driving through Qamishli.\n\nAngry residents hurled potatoes and shouted \"no America\" and \"America liar\" in English. One vehicle backed up over the pavement, in an attempt to get away from the people.\n\n\"Just like rats, America, run away. Long live the resistance and long live the YPG,\" a man holding a photo shouted.\n\nSome US military members, current and former, have also publicly denounced the YPG's abandonment.\n\nMark Giaconia, a 46-year-old former US Army Special Forces soldier, recalled camaraderie with the Kurds he fought alongside in Iraq more than 10 years ago.\n\n\"I trusted them with my life,\" said Giaconia. \"I fought with these guys and watched them die for us.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's decision to \"leave them hanging\" stirred deep emotions, Giaconia said.\n\n\"It's like a violation of trust,\" he said.\n\nThe White House declined to comment.", "description": "Nearly 1,000 US troops withdrawing from northern Syria can only enter Kurdish region in transit, Iraq's army says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/22/0f78fd32f8d4442faf5c9b644b0e148b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
