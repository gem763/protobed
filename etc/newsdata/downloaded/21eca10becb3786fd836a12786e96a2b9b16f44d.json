He has looked Canadians in the eye and said things he knew was not true. We made the case that he has lost the moral authority to govern,\" Scheer said Wednesday morning before his first campaign event in Quebec, a key electoral battleground.\n\nTrudeau, however, aims to run on the strong economic data that shows historically low unemployment, reduced poverty rates and several new trade agreements. His Liberal Party has also championed the legalization of marijuana and middle-class tax cuts.\n\n\"These are things that are making a real difference in people\u2019s lives,\" Trudeau said before he left to campaign in British Columbia.\n\nPOLITICO Pro Canada Be the first to know about significant political and policy developments that impact the world's most significant bilateral relationship, with alerts and analysis arriving directly to your inbox.

Canadians have an important choice to make: Will we go back to the failed policies of the past, or will we continue to move forward? That\u2019s the choice.\u201d\n\nThe new trade deals include the renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement. Trudeau alluded to President Donald Trump, saying the pact was achieved \u201cat a time of U.S. protectionism and unpredictability.\"\n\nTrudeau\u2019s campaign headed immediately to British Columbia for a rally beside the home district of a major player in the SNC-Lavalin scandal: His former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, who clashed with Trudeau over the affair and quit his Cabinet, is seeking reelection in Vancouver as an Independent.\n\nTrudeau also faces challenges to his left, the New Democratic and Green parties, which are hoping to rally votes by pushing for more controls on Canada's large oil sector.\n\nNeither of those parties has ever won a national election in Canada, but often damage the Liberals by winning votes for competitive seats. If neither the Liberals nor Conservatives secure a majority of the seats in Parliament, then the smaller parties could play a crucial role in propping up the government. Polls are too close to call, so there is a good chance of a minority government.\n\nOn Wednesday, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh attacked both Liberals and Conservatives for a tendency to side with corporate interests.\n\n\"We are committed to fighting the corporate interests and making sure the people\u2019s needs are put first,\u201d he said at a rally in Ontario.\n\nThe outcome of the election hinges on results in the three most populous provinces, holding the vast majority of electoral seats: Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May started her campaign in B.C.\n\nTrudeau telegraphed how he intends to campaign in Ontario by linking his rival to the unpopular Conservative provincial premier there: Doug Ford, the brother of Rob Ford, the deceased former mayor of Toronto best known for his public struggle with substance abuse.\n\nTrudeau alluded to budget cuts sprung on the people of Ontario after last year's provincial election, where Ford campaigned successfully on the slogan, \"For The People.\"\n\nThe parties also will clash over at least two major policy differences: carbon taxes, and the price of pharmaceuticals. Trudeau has introduced a national carbon tax, which Scheer promises to scrap. The incumbent prime minister has also hinted that he intends to announce some sort of drug-coverage program during the campaign.\n\nTrudeau mentioned Ford's campaign slogan at least twice in his launch event Wednesday: \"Conservatives like to say they\u2019re for the people, but then they cut taxes for the wealthy, and cut services for everyone else,\" Trudeau said.\n\nThis article tagged under: NAFTA\n\nCanada\n\nEthics Investigations", "description": "Trudeau called for the dissolution of Parliament and officially started the 40-day election season.", "authors": ["Alexander Panetta"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/15/87/17d1cb7f40c383b70d8ce8374553/20190911-justin-trudeau-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
