Other tunnels would also extend underneath Leichhardt and Annandale\n\nResidents who lived near the earlier stages of tunnel construction were frustrated after the depth of the tunnel decreased.\n\nThey also had to endure loud construction noises, vibrations and cracks appearing on the walls of their properties.\n\nAs the construction for the rest of the tunnels continues, more residents are voicing concerns they will experience similar annoyances and their properties may also be damaged.\n\nLeichhardt homeowner Nikki Wedgwood initially believed the tunnel under her property in Emma Street would be 25m deep.\n\nBut when she studied the latest map, she found it will be only eight metres.\n\n'My main concern is once the tunnels have been built there will be constant vibrations and noise and my house will be uninhabitable and unsellable,' Ms Wedgwood told The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n'I still have hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay off my mortgage, so I'd be paying off a home I couldn't live in and couldn't sell ... I'm incredibly worried about it.'\n\nAnother resident, Alesoun Marsden, said she was previously told the tunnel under her home would run 12m below.\n\nBut residents have become worried about the project after a new map suggested the tunnels would run as close as 6 metres under their homes (pictured: Leichhardt)\n\nBut the latest map showed it will also sit eight metres deep and will overlap with another tunnel built for the M4-M5 link.\n\n'I'm very concerned there will be ongoing noise and vibration that will make my life unlivable,' Ms Marsden said.\n\nA Transport for NSW spokesman said some changes have been made to the project and residents may notice noises or vibrations during the construction.\n\nHe said they will offer residents temporary accommodation when appropriate.", "description": "Residents believe the WestConnex Rozelle interchange underneath western Sydney suburbs could damage their homes and construction could make their properties uninhabitable.", "authors": ["Thomas Duff For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/06/19978246-0-image-a-2_1571637337461.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
