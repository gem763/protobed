But in some of his bluntest remarks yet, Iran\u2019s president Hassan Rouhani ruled out any direct talks with the White House.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But in a speech on Tuesday, Mr Rouhani said any negotiations with the US would only be possible with other world powers and only after the US lifts \u201call\u201d sanctions on Iran imposed since Mr Trump last year pulled out of the JCPOA, the landmark nuclear signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cThe issue of bilateral talks is not on the agenda in principle,\u201d Mr Rouhani told parliament. \u201cWe have no plans for bilateral talks with America and have never had.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear whether Mr Kamalvandi was suggesting Iran was pondering a move to boost its small stockpile of 20 per cent enriched uranium as a response to the US sanctions, whether he was showing off about Iran\u2019s technical capabilities, or leaving just enough ambiguity to put pressure on European countries seeking to come up with a scheme that would prevent Iran from making any drastic moves.\n\nTehran has already increased its stockpile of the material and boosted its level of enrichment as a response to US sanctions which have crippled Iran\u2019s ability to sell its oil.\n\nMr Macron has spent hours this week speaking to Mr Rouhani on the phone, and reports suggest he is offering Iran $15bn in credits in exchange for its full compliance with the JCPOA, which gave Iran economic incentives to place limits on its nuclear programme.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
