Before then, Amazon was widely considered to be a front-runner.

It could go to the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) - a legislative branch of the government that offers auditing services, which could offer an immediate stay. Amazon could also go to the US Court of Federal Claims, which could allow it to strengthen its case through discovery.\n\nAmazon has three calendar days to request a debriefing: a process in which the government explains to Amazon why it was unsuccessful and shares details on the evaluation process, said Michael Hordell, a lawyer who works with Barnes and Thornburg LLP.\n\nThe debriefing could also get extended by a few days if the Defence Department allows additional questions after offering an explanation - a move the agency has allowed in the past, several attorneys said.\n\nAfter the Pentagon has answered Amazon's questions, the company has five calendar days to file a \u201cprotest\u201d with the GAO, Hordell said.\n\nIf the company is not happy with the GAO's decision, Amazon could also go to the US Court of Federal Claims, the lawyers said. It could even skip going to the GAO altogether, they said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
