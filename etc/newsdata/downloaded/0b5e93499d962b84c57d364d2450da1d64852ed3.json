By the way, great relationship with Pakistan and with India,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One several days ahead of the Modi event. \u201cBut he\u2019s got a big crowd coming, and I guess the crowd just got a lot bigger because they just announced \u2014 he asked would I go, and I will go.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s appearance at the event comes as his administration is finalizing plans for a modest trade deal with India, a step that would help resolve earlier tensions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi over India\u2019s trade balance with the United States and other trade issues.\n\nThe trade agreement, which could be finalized by the two leaders as soon as this week, is expected to help American farmers and manufacturers by eliminating Indian restrictions on electronics, medical devices and a few agricultural goods. In return, Mr. Trump would restore a special trade status for developing countries, something the president stripped from India this year.\n\nResolving a nettlesome trade dispute with India presents Mr. Trump with an opportunity for a public relations victory amid increasing frustration over his global trade wars with China and other countries.\n\nMr. Modi, 69, is at his best outside India. He has prioritized, more than any other Indian leader in recent decades, India\u2019s brand around the world and projecting an image of a muscular India, an emerging superpower. He travels all across Asia, he was the first Indian prime minister to visit Israel, he has journeyed across Africa and during a visit to New York in 2014 he packed Madison Square Garden with ecstatic crowds cheering: \u201cModi! Modi! Modi!\u201d\n\nHe has come a long way. Years ago, he was banned by American authorities from even entering the United States because of allegations that as chief minister in Gujarat in the early 2000s he was responsible for an explosion of religiously driven violence that claimed more than 1,000 lives, most of them Muslim.", "description": "Mr. Trump treated the giant Houston gathering as his own, seizing on the chance to brag about slashing regulations, lowering unemployment and implementing a tax cut.", "authors": ["Michael D.
