It's unclear if that is where he is now living.\n\nHe has been accused of sexual impropriety by three other women.\n\nLauer has always admitted cheating on his wife but says all of his affairs were consensual.\n\nHe vehemently denied Nevils' allegations in a 1,400-word letter on Thursday which has since been described as the epitome of 'victim blaming'.\n\nIn it, he shared graphic details of what he said they did the night Nevils said he raped her.\n\n'I had an extramarital affair with Brooke Nevils in 2014. It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia. We engaged in a variety of sexual acts.\n\n'We performed oral sex on each other, we had vaginal sex, and we had anal sex,' he wrote in his letter.\n\nThe couple are still trying to sell their $44.8million home on Peconic Bay in the Hamptons\n\nThey also own a six-bedroom home in Sag Harbor which was on the market before the scandal broke but is no longer listed\n\nNevils originally shared the allegations in Ronan Farrow's new book, Catch and Kill, which will be published on October 15.\n\nShe has since tweeted and issued a statement, admonishing his denial and emphasizing her credibility.\n\n'There's a Matt Lauer that millions of Americans watched on TV every morning for two decades. And there is the Matt Lauer who this morning attempted to bully a former colleague into silence,' the statement reads.\n\n'His open letter was a case study in victim blaming.\n\n'I am not afraid of him now regardless of his threats, bullying, and the shaming and predatory tactics I knew he would and now has tried to use against me.'\n\nShe added that she provided 'dates, times, evidence of communications and corroborating accounts' which 'both NBC and Farrow found credible'.\n\n'I continued to engage with him, as many victims of acquaintance rape do, particularly in the work place.\n\n'The shame in this story belongs to him,' she said.", "description": "Roque was pictured driving around Sag Harbor, where the pair live, on Thursday morning, a day after her serially philandering husband was accused of anal rape by one of his mistresses.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/22/19559318-0-image-a-46_1570741734329.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
