Tucker went with the drop kick, and not any old drop kick. He threw it high in the air, let it bounce as he took a couple of approach steps and kicked it high in the air.\n\nThe timing and execution to pull that off without looking foolish is remarkable.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the bad part: It didn\u2019t come close to working. Kansas City Chiefs rookie Mecole Hardman made a fair catch on the high kick, a smart move by a young player. Some have speculated the Ravens wanted to get an extra timeout, with the clock at 2:01 and them trailing by five points, but then it would have made more sense for Tucker to blast one out of the end zone for a touchback.
