Elizabeth Warren, pictured here at the July Democratic debates, called Wednesday for weaning the nation off nuclear power. | Paul Sancya/AP Photo 2020 elections Democrats seize on climate as 2020 primary weapon In a marathon forum on climate change, Democratic contenders began to seek separation from one another on the key issue.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the debate that climate activists wanted.\n\nBut one marathon stretch of climate forums on Wednesday nevertheless marked a sharp turn in the 2020 presidential contest. In seven hours on CNN, the leading Democratic candidates showed the first signs of weaponizing climate change in the primary campaign.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nProdding one another across televised segments and, by proxy, through the network\u2019s moderators, Sen. Bernie Sanders pressed more moderate Democrats on a proposal to ban hydraulic fracturing. Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for weaning the nation off nuclear power, while former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 while fielding criticism about his fundraising \u2014 cast his international experience as instrumental in getting the \u201crest of the world to come along\u201d on climate.\n\n\u201cI think I can do that better than anybody,\u201d Biden said, \u201cno matter what their plan.\u201d\n\nFor months, Democratic candidates had released climate-related plans with common promises: Re-entering the Paris climate agreement, spending trillions of dollars on clean energy initiatives and achieving \u201cnet-zero\u201d emissions by 2050 or earlier. Distinctions among their approaches appeared minute compared to the alternative \u2014 a president who denies climate science, suggested windmills cause cancer and called climate change a Chinese hoax.\n\nTypical of Democrats\u2019 standard view of the field was former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid who, when asked Wednesday if any plan stood out to him as uniquely strong, told reporters, \u201cNo, I think they\u2019ve all been really within the framework of what I think would be important to help save our planet.\u201d\n\nBut within hours of Reid giving that answer, the Democratic candidates were beginning to seek separation from one another on the issue.\n\nWarren called for spending $3 trillion over 10 years to advance clean-energy goals. Sen. Kamala Harris called for $10 trillion in public and private funding to create a clean energy economy by 2045, while South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg proposed his own goal for net-zero emissions by 2050, including a call for economy-wide price on carbon.\n\n\"We have seen, I think, an arms race now, in a good way, of candidates competing to have the most effective plans,\" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee told CNN.\n\nBiden, as he has frequently as the party\u2019s front-runner, was quickly put on the defensive, saying he was unaware that Andrew Goldman \u2014 the co-host of a fundraiser he is scheduled to attend Thursday \u2014 helped found a fossil fuel company.\n\n\"I didn't realize he does that. If you look at the SEC filings, he's not listed as an executive. That's what we look at, the SEC filings. Who are those executives? I kept that pledge. Period,\" Biden said. \"I\u2019m going to look at what you just told me and figure out if that\u2019s accurate.\"\n\nBiden said that his staff told him Goldman did not have any responsibility related to the company, was not on the board and he was not involved in its operations.\n\nBut he added if Goldman was in fact connected to the company, Western LNG, \"I will not in any way accept his help.\"\n\nIf the exchange made Biden uncomfortable, he did not appear to be alone. Harris skirted a question about nuclear power, while Juli\u00e1n Castro, a former Obama Cabinet secretary, was forced to answer for his support for hydraulic fracturing when he was mayor of San Antonio.\n\nAsked if he would ban fracking now, he said, \u201cI support local communities and states that want to ban fracking. I have not called for an immediate ban on fracking. What I am doing is moving us away from fracking and natural gas and investing in \u2026 renewables to get us to net zero [carbon emissions] by 2045.\u201d\n\nInslee himself, after dropping out of the presidential race last month, has become an unlikely prize for the remaining candidates to fight over. Despite his low polling position, Inslee had consumed much of the focus on climate change in the primary. And with his departure, the climate mantle has become more readily available to other, more viable candidates. Several candidates have called him in recent days, and his significance was evident Wednesday.\n\nWarren said she \u201cproudly adopted\u201d many of Inslee\u2019s proposals. Castro, who this week released his own plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045, offered a \u201cshout out\u201d to Inslee for the work he did in his campaign, while Harris quoted him directly.\n\n\u201cGovernor Inslee, I\u2019m stealing your line,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe said \u2026 \u2018So, Donald Trump says wind turbines cause cancer.\u2019 And Jay Inslee famously and \u2026 with great humor said, \u2018No, they don\u2019t cause cancer. They cause jobs.\u2018\u201d\n\nInslee\u2019s departure \u201cdoes open the issue up a little bit more for the rest of them,\u201d said Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist. \u201cThere\u2019s more room for them to get some attention for their positions.\u201d\n\nEven from the sidelines of the forum, candidates were working to gain exposure on the issue. Tom Steyer, the billionaire megadonor and climate activist who was excluded from the forum because he did not meet the threshold for the next Democratic debate, chose Wednesday to release an analysis of his own climate plan, asserting it would create 46 million jobs over 10 years.\n\n\u201cFrom my standpoint, what I\u2019m saying is an order of magnitude different from what everybody else is saying,\u201d Steyer told POLITICO of his approach to climate change. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is this is job one, and no one else is saying that \u2026 There\u2019s no one else [in the primary field] who has a history of actual action on this of any kind.\u201d\n\nThe one-upmanship on climate would have seemed improbable for an issue that long languished in the backwaters of American politics. And the political effect of their jockeying is unclear.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Inslee languished in the presidential contest despite his singular focus on climate. And the results of a Morning Consult survey of voters who rank candidates\u2019 climate plans as \u201cvery important\u201d to them, released Wednesday, mirrored national polling generally: Biden is running first among such voters at 30 percent, followed by Warren and Sanders at 21 percent and 20 percent, respectively.\n\nBut with polls showing Democratic voters \u2014 and especially young Democratic voters \u2014 increasingly concerned about climate, the issue has gained voice this year. Following the CNN town hall, MSNBC will sponsor a two-day forum on climate later this month.\n\n\u201cIf you had asked me eight months ago, I think there was a lot of discussion of how we make climate change an issue in the campaign, and what do we need to do,\u201d said Paul Getsos, national director of the Peoples Climate Movement.\n\nBut now, he said, \u201cClimate is being discussed in a way. The question is, our work \u2026 is to move it beyond a talking point \u2026 We have to work to make sure that actual, concrete policies are implemented.\u201d\n\nOne major reason climate activists had lobbied for a climate-specific presidential debate was to force candidates \u2014 in front of a large audience \u2014 to take positions on climate change that they could be held to if elected.\n\nThe forums are widely viewed by climate activists \u2014 and many candidates \u2014 as a lesser alternative to such a debate, which the Democratic National Committee has declined to sanction.\n\n\u201cI think there is not a lot of earned trust for the Democratic Party from people who care about climate,\u201d said Jonathan Lipman, a Democratic strategist who does communications work for several climate and social justice-focused groups.\n\nHowever, he said, \u201cThe candidates know that, which is why you\u2019re seeing this bidding war today\u201d of releasing increasingly robust climate plans. \u201cThat\u2019s new. That\u2019s a paradigm shift \u2026 That was the goal of forcing a debate: Don\u2019t just say at a rally that you\u2019re going to do something on climate change. What happens when you\u2019re all pushing each other to be more specific? I think the town halls accomplish a lot of the same stuff.\u201d\n\nGavin Bade contributed to this report.", "description": "In a marathon forum on climate change, Democratic contenders began to seek separation from one another on the key issue.", "authors": ["David Siders", "Zack Colman"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/47/98/c518b7fe42f99b21de7b07e9321a/190904-warren-cnn-ap-773.jpg"}
