More\n\nBy a large margin, Americans trust the Supreme Court more than either of the other two branches of government (Congress and the presidency), according to the nationwide poll of 1,423 adults taken Sept. 3 to 13.\n\nAnd most oppose the idea of adding seats on the court, an idea embraced by some on the left who feel Republicans have bent the rules to maintain a conservative majority on the court.\n\nBut one idea for reforming the court that does have broad approval (72%) is having justices serve fixed terms instead of lifetime appointments, an idea that is strongly favored by Republicans, Democrats and independents alike in the survey.\n\nCompared to the other branches, the high court is well regarded: 80% of those surveyed have at least some confidence in the institution and almost 40% have a lot of confidence. The court rates much higher than Congress and the presidency in this regard. In fact, 57% said they trust the Supreme Court the most of the three branches, compared to 21% who chose the presidency and 22% who chose Congress.\n\nThe court is not perceived as highly partisan or extreme. Notably, its chief justice, John Roberts, is the least polarizing member of the court when it comes to the difference between how Democrats and Republicans view individual justices; Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by Republican Trump, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, appointed by Democrat Bill Clinton, are the most polarizing along partisan lines.\n\nAbout half of those surveyed perceive the court as moderate. Almost 40% perceive it as conservative and a bit over 10% perceive it as liberal. But only 1 in 10 perceive it as \u201cextremely\u201d conservative or \u201cextremely\u201d liberal. Most think the court follows \u201cmainly the law\u201d rather than \u201cmainly politics\u201d in reaching its decisions.\n\nThe poll also found that, while Democrats and Republicans are sharply divided over key rulings the court has handed down, these partisan differences don\u2019t extend to the public\u2019s view of all cases.\n\nFor example, of seven major rulings the survey asked about, the most popular was one that is widely embraced by conservatives: the finding in District of Columbia v. Heller that the Second Amendment confers an individual right to bear arms. It was viewed favorably by two-thirds of those polled.\n\nSOURCE Marquette University Law School poll conducted Sept. 3-13, 2019, of 1,423 adults. Margin of error is \u00b1 3.6 percentage points.
