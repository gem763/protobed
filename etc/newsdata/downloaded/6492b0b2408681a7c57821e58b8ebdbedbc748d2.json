The best revenge is living well. I'm not going to give up.'", "description": "The reality star, 31, uploaded a picture of her younger sibling Laura Adamson's ultrasound on her Instagram page on Monday, and propelled her fans into a spin as they jumped to conclusions.", "authors": ["Harry Howard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/14/19397978-0-image-a-11_1570456616277.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
