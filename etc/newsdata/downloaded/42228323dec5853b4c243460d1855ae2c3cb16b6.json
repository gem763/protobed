I accept the opinions when you don\u2019t win, it doesn\u2019t only happen at Tottenham, it happens in all the clubs in the world, at a different level too. It is normal that (the Bayern) game creates a lot of opinion and rumours and everyone needs to talk.\n\n\u201cIn the end all that happened is that we lost a game. There is no doubt we are staying together and we are going to find the way to be successful again, no doubt.\u201d\n\nWith the future of so many of his established players uncertain, some of Pochettino\u2019s squad have been accused of no longer playing for their manager.\n\nPochettino shot that suggestion down, citing the Premier League win over Southampton with 10 men last Saturday as evidence of their unity.\n\nAsked if he thought his players were still playing for him, he replied: \u201cI really believe. I have no doubt the players always want to do their best to win. They play for themselves, their families, then for the club and the coaching staff.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt they have commitment, with four years or one in their contract. The negative result like the other day was three days after beating Southampton with 10 men, it cannot change completely, the ideas or perception.\u201d\n\nSpurs\u2019 plight has not been helped by the drop in form of Dele Alli, who has been hindered by hamstring injuries for much of the last 12 months.\n\nAlli was left out of Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for the Euro 2020 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, but Pochettino is expecting the 23-year-old to get back to his best.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to understand that football is about form, about some not-so-good periods Dele only needs time to recover his best performance. We\u2019re going to help him, provide the tools and platform for him to recover.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s going to recover. He\u2019s in a tough period but we need him, he\u2019s a very important player for us. In time, we\u2019re going to recover the best Dele Alli.\u201d\n\nSpurs are hoping to bounce back from their midweek mauling when they visit Brighton on Saturday lunchtime.\n\nSerge Aurier is suspended and Pochettino has hinted that midfielder Moussa Sissoko will fill the void at right-back, having done so following Aurier\u2019s red card last week.\n\n\u201cI think Moussa was very good playing one hour against Southampton with tough players like (Sofiane) Boufal or (Nathan) Redmond,\u201d Pochettino added.\n\n\u201cHe did very well and that made me think a little bit that his option is bigger than another player.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino wants to stay at Tottenham for the long haul, suggesting he would like to be at the club for at least another five years.
