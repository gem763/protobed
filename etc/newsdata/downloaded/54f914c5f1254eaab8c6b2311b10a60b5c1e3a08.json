For $20, attendees can see \"Hello, Privilege. It's me, Chelsea,\" a Netflix documentary about \"how white privilege impacts American culture -- and the ways it\u2019s benefited\" Handler's personal life and career.\n\nAccording to a flyer posted on Twitter, Handler will a member of the panel who will discuss white privilege in America. Other panelists include Melina Abdulah, Co-Founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles; Dahlia Ferlito, Co-Founder White People for Black Lives; and Jody Armour, author, playwright and University of Southern California Professor of Law.\n\nSave the date! Our next \u201cCourage Against Racism\u201d event will be a screening of the @chelseahandler @netflix documentary, followed by a panel discussion. All proceeds go to @BLMLA.\n\n\n\n$20 at the door, no one turned away.https://t.co/NnJD5uwwMb pic.twitter.com/yFOaEkW0IP \u2014 WP4BL (@WP4BL) September 28, 2019\n\nAccording to the Daily Wire, Handler goes into details about being a white woman and her understanding of the struggle black people in America face:\n\nIn one of the earlier scenes, Handler confesses, \u201cI am as white as they come\u201d while speaking to a diverse group of college students and community activists at an open mic night about privilege. \u201cI got the impression that black people are sick and tired of being asked questions about white people\u2019s problems,\u201d she later reflected. \u201cWe need to talk to people who are white and stop asking black people to solve our problems because it\u2019s a white persons\u2019 problem.\u201d Still, Handler quipped that she needed counseling prior to interviewing four conservative white women who agreed to participate in her documentary. \u201cI had to do a lot of therapy to even have these conversations with people, because I have a temper and I\u2019m reactive,\u201d Handler said in a recent appearance on \u201cThe View.\u201d \u201cWhen somebody\u2019s annoying, I want to tell them that they\u2019re annoying or that they\u2019re stupid, but my exercise in this film was to be more quiet and to stop inserting myself,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us all to understand what everybody is really thinking and believing and to have the conversation.\u201d In the documentary, Handler attends an L.A. Police Commission meeting with Dr. Melina Abdullah, a founding member of Black Lives Matter. Handler applauded after Abdullah told the LAPD commissioners they compose \u201ca rubber-stamp body for the police that continue to kill and abuse our people.\u201d\n\nThe event is being put on by White People 4 Black Lives, \u201ca white anti-racist collective that operates in solidarity with Black Lives Matter Los Angeles.\u201d Their goal is for white people to educate other white people about racism and oppression.\n\nWhy does everything need to be labeled a \"black person issue\" or a \"white person issue\"? Why can't things simply be an American issue or a human issue? Why does everything have to come down to race? There are plenty of white people who live in poverty, just as there are black people who have thrived.\n\nIf anything, black Americans should be upset that people, like Handler, claim to continually be this outspoken voice for people of color. She's making a quick buck off \"challenging her whiteness\" and making things about her. This has nothing to do with rights wrongs but everything to do with stroking an ego.", "description": "Here we go..10/08/2019 22:01:29PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/292/ccf4601e-05f4-4912-9685-2e27169dee5e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
