And we made that significant toward a new deal, it's getting papered now.\"However, some news outlets took a more skeptical angle.The Financial Times said little had been given away by Beijing, but China had been successful in holding off tariff increases on 250-billion dollars worth of Chinese goods.Bloomberg pointed out that the deal Beijing agreed to last Friday was similar to the amount of agricultural goods China imported from the U.S. a couple of years ago.The announcement also did not include many details, including on intellectual property protection, exchange rate mechanisms and financial services,\u2026 which all added fuel to the heightened trade tensions between the two countries.Because of these variables that remain,\u2026 the U.S. has suspended the increase in tariffs rather than completely withdrawing them.\"The second half of September, that is scheduled to be effect in December 15th, and the President has not made final decision on that, but there is plenty of time to make that decision.\"Chinese state news outlets have welcomed the phase-one agreement.The fact the country endured more than 450-days locked in a trade dispute with the world's number one economic superpower and came out the other side relatively unscathed added to the positivity.As President Trump said on the day the phase-one deal was announced that it could take up to five weeks to get the agreement written up and it probably won't be ready until Trump meets his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the APEC leaders' meeting in Chile in November.This delay leaves open the possibility of the deal being rewritten or potentially falling apart completely in the meantime.With so many unknowns, analysts say it's too early to say who came away smelling sweeter following the down and dirty trade war that gripped the world for well over a year.Won Jung-hwan, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
