For his trouble, McEwan has been accused of exhibiting \u201ca disturbing tendency towards mellowness\u201d (fellow author John Banville) and of being \u201cthe only living link to New Labour\u201d (The New Republic, in the course of explaining why McEwan will never win the Nobel Prize). Though the author\u2019s sales have remained brisk and his prose as sumptuous as ever, both his focus and his audience have measurably narrowed in his late career. Whereas McEwan was, for a moment, the king of the epic, he has since been content to produce witty and urbane novels that wed a graduate-school vocabulary to an innate distrust of progressivism\u2019s destructive impulses. He has, in other words, been writing for people exactly like me, which is one of the reasons why the utter failure of his new book is so disappointing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt ninety-nine-and-a-half postcard-sized pages, The Cockroach is a mere wisp of a novel. Yet the complexity of its conceit \u2014 anti-Brexit satire in the style of Kafka\u2019s The Metamorphosis \u2014 belies the paltriness of its word count. Like its German progenitor, The Cockroach opens in a bedroom, where the title insect awakens (from \u201cuneasy dreams,\u201d inevitably) to discover that he has been transformed into the prime minister of Great Britain, Jim Sams. Sensing that his transfiguration is part of an important mission, Sams convenes his Cabinet, only to realize upon doing so that nearly all of those assembled are a \u201cband of [his] brothers and sisters\u201d \u2014 a \u201clittle swarm of the nation\u2019s best, come to inhabit and embolden a faltering leadership.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe insects\u2019 project \u2014 a fictional Brexit stand-in whose pursuit will turn Sams from a meek Theresa May into a roaring Boris Johnson \u2014 is \u201cReversalism,\u201d a willfully absurd economic arrangement whereby the nation\u2019s money flow is flip-flopped. \u201cAt the end of a working week,\u201d McEwan explains, \u201can employee hands over money to the company for all the hours that she has toiled. But when she goes to the shops, she is generously compensated at retail rates for every item she carries away.\u201d Confusing? Idiotic? An affront to common sense and basic economic principles? Yes to all of the above. And therein lies the problem. For McEwan, who admitted in an interview last month that \u201ceveryone [he] know[s] . . . is at a point of total despair\u201d over Britain\u2019s prospective divorce from the European Union, Reversalism and Brexit are one. Both are ludicrous; both spring from the passing fancy of an unthinking majority; both, crucially, \u201clift beyond mere reason to embrace a mystical sense of nation.\u201d So dismissive, in fact, is McEwan of his Brexiteering opponents that The Cockroach ignores their motives altogether. In a late scene in which Sams encounters a character clearly meant to represent Angela Merkel, the German chancellor demands to know why the PM is \u201ctearing [his] nation apart.\u201d \u201cBecause,\u201d Sams thinks to himself. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Because that\u2019s what we believe in. Because that\u2019s what we said we\u2019d do. Because that\u2019s what people said they wanted. Because I\u2019ve come to the rescue. Because. That, ultimately, was the only answer: because.\u201d\n\nExcept that \u201cbecause\u201d isn\u2019t the answer at all. In the novel\u2019s concluding pages (can one spoil a ridiculous and smallminded fable?), McEwan finally delivers his punchline. Whenever \u201cdarkness\u201d is \u201cpredominant\u201d in humans, cockroaches thrive. \u201cWhere they have embraced poverty, filth, squalor,\u201d Sams tells his colleagues, \u201cwe have grown in strength.\u201d Reversalism, far from being the misguided hobbyhorse of a patriotic citizenry, is revealed to be the malicious plot of those who would feast \u2014 literally \u2014 on human misery. Needless to say, this is far worse than the political nihilism Sams comes close to voicing in his German counterpart\u2019s office. Yet unless McEwan really means to suggest that his countrymen on the Brexiting right are evil, the gesture simply lacks analogical power. Boris Johnson is leading the U.K. out of Europe because a broken, immiserated, and solitary Britain would suit him? Not bloody likely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat, then, can McEwan be thinking? In part, the answer may be that the author is suffering from what CapX contributor James Snell has called the \u201ceducated incomprehension\u201d of \u201cthe literary class\u201d concerning Brexit. Or perhaps McEwan understands Euroskepticism perfectly but despises it. My own suspicion is that the author and the Brexit crowd are in broad agreement about ends but locked in mortal combat concerning means. McEwan himself has written that \u201cthe cathedrals, the parliaments, the paintings, the courts of law, the libraries and the labs\u201d of Western civilization are \u201cfar too precious to pull down.\u201d For Brexiteers, it is rule from Brussels and the attending immigration quotas that threaten those accomplishments. For McEwan, it is Brexit itself. And never the twain shall meet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout question, The Cockroach has its moments. The prose is fluid and beautiful. The pacing is superb, as is McEwan\u2019s take on a certain American president (who hilariously refers to Sams\u2019s economic project as \u201cRevengelism\u201d). Intriguingly, the EU itself comes in for a bit of well-deserved mockery in the novel, as when the Strasbourg Parliament must \u201cdecamp to Brussels\u201d and \u201cenjoy a decent lunch\u201d before discussions of Reversalism can resume. So, for that matter, does the Me Too movement, by which Sams destroys an innocent, if inconveniently recalcitrant, colleague.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet despite these virtues, the book that contains them is sour, ungenerous, and ignorant. It says little and means less, and in assuming the worst of its opponents, it wildly overshoots its mark. Though Ian McEwan has a legitimate claim to be the best novelist of the young 21st century, it\u2019s probably best if we all pretend that this Cockroach never crawled in.", "description": "His new novel, The Cockroach, takes aim at enemies who don\u2019t exist.", "authors": ["Graham Hillard", "Ilya Shapiro", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
