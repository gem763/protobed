Born in 1916, she lived a long life and saw a lot of history being made, including the invention of the television.\n\nAfter passing away, according to an ABC7 report, her family was shocked to receive a bill for an early termination fee from DirecTV.\n\n\"Everything was fine until we went to disconnect and that's when all the surprises happened,\u201d said her son in law John Manrique, who also told the local news, \u201cShe was a fantastic lady, and she was able to live at home.\u201d\n\n\"They told us... we're going to charge you $160 for an early termination fee,'' Manrique said. \"She's gone. Nobody's living (here). We're selling the house. You're going to tell us we have to keep the service at a house that's not ours?\"\n\nAlbright had DirecTV service for many years, so the penalty initially didn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nAs it turned out, Albright\u2019s daughter or another caregiver often spent the night, and the family had added an additional DirecTV box in a back room.\n\nLittle did they know that adding a new box meant adding a whole new two year service contract, ABC7 reports.\n\n\"Nobody told us that,\u201d Manrique said. \"And in fact we made it clear when we added the TV in the extra room that it was a temporary thing ... We're saying my mother in law's on hospice, we're not gonna pay, you know, two year contract.\"\n\nAt the time, DirecTV allegedly said that the family was on the hook because the bill was in Albright\u2019s daughter\u2019s name. Much like many other families taking care of elderly relatives, Albright\u2019s daughter had taken over her mother\u2019s finances.\n\nManrique feels companies should be more understanding of these types of situations. \"Because her mother couldn't do it anymore and a lot of people wind up doing that,\u201d Manrique said. \"We were trying to make sure that all the bills got paid. \"\n\n\n\nThe Manriques said they called DirecTV asking for proof that someone signed a two year agreement.\n\n\n\n\"And they had no proof other than you started this new service on this date ... and that starts a new contract whether you signed it or not,\u201d Manrique said. \"Every time you hiccup they start you on a new two-year agreement basically. It'll run the rest of your life if you accept some other feature or other. They got you.\u201d\n\n\n\nYahoo Lifestyle contacted DirecTV and the company said, \u201cWe have apologized to the family and resolved this.\u201d\n\nTheir representative also added, \u201cClearly this was a mistake because of the name on the account, in this type of situation, we cancel accounts and waive all early termination fees.\u201d\n\nOften caregivers find themselves in a situation where they must take over the finances of an elderly or infirm person. Investopedia offers suggestions about how to do this \u2014 such as putting their assets in a trust that a family member has access to \u2014 in order to avoid credit issues or bills after death.\n\nManrique told ABC7 that eventually the situation \u201cturned out fantastic.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Isabel Albright of San Lorenzo, Calif. died last December at the age of 102.
