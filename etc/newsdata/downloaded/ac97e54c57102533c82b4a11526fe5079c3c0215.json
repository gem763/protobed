RPT-Saudi Prince Abdulaziz: oil hawk with soft diplomacy touch\n\n(Repeats SEPT 12 story, no change to text)\n\nBy Rania El Gamal and Dmitry Zhdannikov\n\nABU DHABI, Sept 12 (Reuters) - OPEC is notorious for arguing\n\nover production policies - but Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has\n\neffectively managed to deliver his first output cut just four\n\ndays after becoming the new Saudi energy minister.\n\nWith an impending listing of state oil giant Saudi Aramco\n\nand rising Saudi budget needs, the issue of higher oil prices is\n\nlooming large for Prince Abdulaziz.\n\nBut when he first met fellow Gulf oil ministers and OPEC\n\nofficials this week, his first message wasn't about oil prices.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz said first and foremost he was keen to\n\nrebuild trust with oil neighbours Kuwait, the United Arab\n\nEmirates, Oman and other OPEC members, sources familiar with the\n\nmeetings in Abu Dhabi said.\n\nThe prince, a veteran oil official and senior member of the\n\nAl Saud ruling family, is expected to deal with OPEC matters\n\ndifferently from his predecessor Khalid al-Falih, according to\n\nthree sources, who were briefed on the discussions.\n\nFalih has repeatedly upset other OPEC producers by forging\n\ndeals with non-OPEC Russia first without discussing them with\n\nthe kingdom's Gulf OPEC allies, who traditionally cut or raised\n\noutput together with Riyadh.\n\n\"The new minister likes decisions to be unanimous instead of\n\nbeing presented as just Saudi-Russian agreements,\" one source\n\ntold Reuters. \"He wants us to be a united front.\"\n\nWithin hours the strategy had paid out.\n\nIraq and Nigeria, two of OPEC's members which were\n\nover-producing well above their OPEC targets, joined Prince\n\nAbdulaziz at the same news conference table after a joint\n\ncommittee meeting, known as the JMMC, to pledge swift production\n\ncuts. As a result of their actions, OPEC's output may drop further\n\nby around 400,000 bpd, or 0.4 percent of global supply, to help\n\nsupport oil prices at a time of rising fears of global economic\n\nrecession and soaring U.S. production, two sources said.\n\n\"Acting in unity sends strong messages to the market and\n\ngives it greater confidence,\" the prince said as he invited the\n\nIraqi and Nigerian ministers to explain their next moves.\n\n\"My honourable colleague Minister Novak has wakened up to a\n\nnew reality which is that we are not being too inclusive and we\n\nshould have been,\" said the Saudi minister, who was seated next\n\nto his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak.\n\nCARDS CLOSE TO HIS CHEST\n\nOPEC and its allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+,\n\nmet on Thursday in Abu Dhabi to discuss the market outlook ahead\n\nof a full OPEC+ ministerial meeting in Vienna in December.\n\nOn Wednesday, Prince Abdulaziz met with Gulf oil ministers\n\nand senior OPEC officials where he delivered his message.\n\n\"He also stressed the importance of compliance by all\n\ncountries - whether big or small,\" the first source said.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz, a son of the king and half-brother of\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was named energy minister on\n\nSunday. Known in the industry as a diplomatic negotiator, he has\n\nlong experience of cutting OPEC deals. But he also keeps his cards close to his chest.\n\nIn his first interactions with the media this week, he joked\n\nabout being too direct, with an \"excessively spontaneous\" sense\n\nof humour and as a \"kitchen and basement\" man.\n\nBut he avoided predicting future OPEC policy and U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump moves against Iran, Riyadh's arch rival.\n\n\"What we hear now is something, and what can happen is\n\nsomething else,\" the prince said.\n\n\"I don't want to go into details from the political aspect,\n\nI am as chair of the JMMC should take a neutral position that\n\nrepresents everyone.\"\n\n(Editing by David Evans)", "description": "RPT-Saudi Prince Abdulaziz: oil hawk with soft diplomacy touch", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEBA206K_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
