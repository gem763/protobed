What else?\" It wasn't fun,' she added.\n\nBlessing: The Studio 10 host (pictured with her mother and late husband John) says if it weren't for an MRI scan, her cancer 'might have [had] a different outcome'\n\n'Luckily they got it all out. If I didn't have an MRI, it might have been a very different outcome.
