There was no explanation as to why they were cutting their trip short, Rolf said.\n\nNebraska department of agriculture also said the Chinese officials called off a visit to farms in Nebraska.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue confirmed just Thursday the meetings were in the works as a way for China to build goodwill with American farmers.\n\nThe Chinese delegation, led by Vice Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs Han Jun, had planned follow-on visits to Bozeman, Montana, and Omaha, Nebraska, CNBC previously reported.\n\nThe cancellation put a damper on hopes that China would restart purchasing U.S. agricultural goods, which it had halted in April in retaliation against President Donald Trump's tariffs.", "description": "Chinese trade negotiators suddenly canceled a visit to meet U.S. farmers after they wrapped up trade talks in Washington this week.", "authors": ["Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106116326-1567783424472gettyimages-1152687847.jpeg?v=1567783472", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
