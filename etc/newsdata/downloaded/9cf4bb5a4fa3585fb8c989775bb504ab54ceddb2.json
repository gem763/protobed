Thornberry: Trump\u2019s ISIS Rhetoric \u2018Uncomfortable to Hear\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "On Sunday\u2019s broadcast of CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX), the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, commented on President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of the death Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS.\n\nHost Jake Tapper asked, \u201cWhat do you make of the president\u2019s\u2014 he painted a very vivid picture of al Baghdadi dying a very cowardly death, which I don\u2019t doubt for a second, a lot of these terrorists are cowards. It was very vidid. He talked about him crying and whining, detonating his vest, killing his three children while he did so. I don\u2019t doubt it, they\u2019re monsters, but is there any concern on your part because now there is a question what ISIS will do in response to this move, in response perhaps to the president\u2019s rhetoric. Does that concern you at all in terms of galvanizing or motivating isis terrorists?\u201d\n\nThornberry replied, \u201cIt probably makes me a little uncomfortable to hear a president talking that way. Again Baghdadi was the inspirational leader for the ISIS network across the world from Africa to Southeast Asia. If you can take a little bit of the glamour off him and make him less inspirational, there is a value to that for all of these folks who are on their computers or in these networks looking to attack.\u201d\n\n\u201dBut you\u2019re exactly right, ISIS will seek to do something to show, we\u2019re still here, we\u2019re still relevant,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo the United States is going to be tested in the days to come, and as you know, one of my big concerns is we\u2019ve only funded the military for about 25 more days. The dysfunction in Washington is translating into doing real damage to our military, who we depend on and are so proud of, for things like this.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Sunday's broadcast of CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Rep.
