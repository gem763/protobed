The proceeds will mainly be used to finance tax relief on train tickets.\n\nThe German government agreed that short-haul flights, particularly heavy in CO2 emissions, should be taxed more heavily in proportion to underlying ticket prices than longer flights, the official said.\n\nUnder the latest version of the plans, value-added tax on train tickets will fall from 19% to 7% from January 1, 2020, making tickets around 10% cheaper.", "description": "Berlin plans to almost double taxes on short-haul flights under Germany's emissions cutting programme, an official at the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday, a bigger increase than expected.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
