The additional funding values Group Nine at $600 million, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nGroup Nine Media formed in 2016 by rolling up Thrillist, The Dodo, NowThis, and Seeker in 2016, when Discovery put $100 million into the company.\n\nThe company said the new funds would be used to fuel its video department and newly launched commerce division, and for acquisitions.\n\nThe company recently shook up its sales leadership, replacing Chief Revenue Officer Todd Anderman, who is leaving after more than six years at the digital media company.\n\nRead more: Billions from VC companies like Lerer Hippeau and Lightspeed fueled the rise of digital media and stoked crazy expectations for growth \u2014 here's why insiders say that approach is killing companies\n\nWith Anderman leaving, Group Nine is installing three execs to head sales and marketing: Rachel Baumgarten, the executive vice president of marketing; Kavata Mbondo, the executive vice president of business operations; and Adam Shlachter, the chief client officer. They'll operate as a team, reporting to Christa Carone, Group Nine's president, who herself comes from an agency and marketing background.\n\nThe idea is that the trio's experience working with big clients on the agency side will help Group Nine get bigger budgets from large ad spenders that span custom content, sponsorships, and the like. Shlachter is a digital-agency veteran, while Baumgarten is a vet of Viacom and Omnicom Media Group.\n\n\"There's never been a better opportunity to build and define your brand on mobile, so we're thrilled to have this talented trifecta of complementary industry veterans positioned to seamlessly help our clients drive their narrative and break through the clutter,\" Carone said in a statement.\n\nGroup Nine, which is headed by Ben Lerer, was formed on Lerer's belief that consolidation is coming to digital media and that Group Nine could be a leader in digital video. It took a big step in that direction earlier this year, creating NowThis Originals, a 25-person group, to make original video content to sell to distribution platforms.\n\nDigital-media companies are trying to get to profitability\n\nMany heavily backed digital-media companies are struggling to get to profitability, and many media watchers assume that some of these companies will merge to cut costs so they can keep operating. Rumors have swirled that Group Nine was in serious talks to merge with Refinery29, a women's lifestyle media company. Group Nine has been trying to diversify its revenue, particularly into e-commerce.\n\nGroup Nine hasn't disclosed if it's profitable. It's valued at $500 million, based on Discovery valuing its 42% stake of the company at $212 million. Discovery has an option to buy the remaining stake in the company but hasn't exercised it.\n\nAnderman became Group Nine's chief revenue officer in January 2018 after starting in sales roles at Thrillist. In a LinkedIn post, he didn't indicate if he had another job lined up:", "description": "The millennial-aimed digital-media company raised $50 million in new funding from lead investor Discovery Inc. and Axel Springer.", "authors": ["Lucia Moses"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d2f41bf767d29242f063d29-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
