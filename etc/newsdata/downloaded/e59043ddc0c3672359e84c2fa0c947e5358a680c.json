The S&P 500 added 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped about 0.1%. All three indexes are up more than 1% for the week.\n\nEasing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, alongside the prospect of looser monetary policy around the world, helped lift stocks this week, pushing major indexes back toward highs reached in July. The indexes have rebounded after a volatile August that rattled share prices and government bond yields around the world.\n\nInvestors continue to be preoccupied with the status of the trade talks. China said Friday that it wouldn't impose new tariffs on U.S. soybeans, pork and other agricultural goods, a further sign of easing tensions between the two largest economies.\n\nThat followed a Wall Street Journal report earlier in the week that Beijing was making efforts to narrow the scope of negotiations and a postponement by President Trump of new tariffs that were set to be imposed on $250 billion of Chinese imports from Oct. 1.\n\nConcerns about slowing growth in the U.S. also abated after fresh data showed American shoppers spent strongly in August.\n\nThat promoted investors to dump safer assets like Treasurys. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.834%, according to Tradeweb, from 1.789% Thursday. Yields rise as bond prices fall.\n\nThe lurch higher in bond yields helped shares of financial companies in the S&P 500, which were some of its biggest gainers.\n\nBut underneath this week's ascent by the stock indexes were sharp moves for different shares and sectors. Investors moved money out of high-momentum stocks into cheaper value stocks, a dynamic that is unnerving to some.\n\n\"As people are cycling back into equities, they're taking a more cautious approach,\" said Joe Mallen, chief investment officer of Helios Quantitative Research.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of smaller companies that have underperformed the S&P 500's advance this year zipped past it. The Russell 2000 is up 5.3% this week, outpacing the S&P 500's 1.3% gain.\n\nSome investors remain on edge for other reasons. U.S. stocks ascended for much of last year before relinquishing their gains and falling into negative territory toward the end of the year as concerns about economic growth around the world weighed on share prices. They remain wary about a re-do. For example, the S&P 500 peaked last fall before tumbling almost by December.\n\nThough recent signs of consumer spending have assuaged concerns about the U.S. economy manufacturing data has continued to disappoint investors. Additionally, many are nervous about lackluster growth in other parts of the world eventually trickling into the U.S.\n\nAny surprises from the Federal Reserve meeting next week--when investors are expecting the central bank to slash rates for the second time this year--could rattle confidence among investors. Data this week showed that inflation picked up recently, potentially altering the case for greater cuts ahead.\n\nMr. Mallen said that he's optimistic about an eventual trade deal but he's still girding for more volatility in the next few months.\n\n\"There's still going to be some turbulence,\" Mr. Mallen said.\n\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.4% in midday trade. The relative quiet came after a volatile day for European stocks Thursday when the ECB launched a long-awaited package of stimulus measures, including an interest-rate cut and a renewed program of bond purchases, known as quantitative easing.\n\nMoritz Sterzinger, a director at financial-advisory firm JCRA, flagged concerns that further quantitative easing might have limited impact on growth and inflation, given that interest rates are in negative territory.\n\nHe questioned: \"How big are the diminishing returns to monetary stimulus, and how effective are additional rate cuts and another round of quantitative easing going to be in terms of stimulating the economy?\"\n\nIn Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rallied 1% and Japan's Nikkei was up 1.1%. Markets in China, Korea and Taiwan were closed for a holiday.\n\nWrite to Avantika Chilkoti at Avantika.Chilkoti@wsj.com and Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 13, 2019 12:33 ET (16:33 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
