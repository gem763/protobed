A crime is a crime,\" BOU head M.A. Mannan told AFP. \"We have cancelled her enrolment. She will never be able to get admitted here again.\"\n\nA college official reportedly told AFP that lookalikes were \"protected by the MP's musclemen when they sat for the tests. Everybody knew it but nobody uttered a word because she is from a very influential family\".\n\nNusrat did not answer Euronews' phone call and has not responded to an e-mail sent to her for comment.\n\nEuronews has also reached out to the Awami League Party for comment.", "description": "Bangladesh MP was expelled from university after a private broadcaster reportedly uncovered she had hired lookalikes to take her exams.", "authors": ["Cristina Abellan Matamoros"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/01/98/1000x563_cmsv2_85c29480-cd65-5969-b807-5e7cf60179a0-4250198.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
