Such an act, good act or bad, is more than a \u2018stunt,\u2019 it is form of direct action against a problem.\u201d\n\nPeters goes on to observe that from the perspective of Church law, the act could be perfectly justifiable, regardless of \u201cwhether the figures are demonic or merely faddish.\u201d\n\nCanon 1210, for instance, states that only those things \u201cwhich serve the exercise or promotion of worship, piety, or religion are permitted in a sacred place; anything not consonant with the holiness of the place is forbidden.\u201d\n\nAnd Canon 1220 adds that those who are responsible of churches must take care that \u201cwhatever is inappropriate to the holiness of the place is excluded.\u201d\n\nThe faithful \u201chave the right to trust that what they see in Catholic sacred places is actually there in service to the sacred and is not simply a gesture toward some form of political correctness or the latest cause du jour, to say nothing of it possibly being simply evil,\u201d Peters writes.\n\nAs a rule, he concludes, \u201cI hold that removing objects from private property is not an act of good order. But then, neither is setting up idols (whether to demons or to secular causes) in Catholic churches an act of good order.\u201d\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Pope Francis said that Christianity welcomes pagans, but they must \u201creject idolatry and all its expressions\u201d to follow Christ.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
