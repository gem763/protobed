as much in enabling new jobs as improving existing ones.\n\n\u201cIt will drive regeneration in our cities and towns around the stations and beyond, whilst the stations themselves will also be economic engines in their own right.\u201d\n\nThe NPP says the \u201cpotential aggregate GVA (gross value added) prize for the North equates to \u00a31,000billion (\u00a31trillion) between 2035 and 2050\u201d.\n\nBut the jackpot hinges on delivering HS2, warns the think-tank.\n\nPhase one between London and Birmingham is due to open at the end of 2026.\n\nThe second stage to Leeds and Manchester is scheduled to be finished by 2033.\n\nIn Leeds, HS2 will create 50,000 jobs, adding \u00a354billion to the regional economy by 2050, the NPP report says.\n\nIn Greater Manchester, by 2050 HS2 will create 60,000 jobs around Piccadilly and Manchester Airport, with an additional 37,000 jobs around Crewe railway station.\n\nAnd in Liverpool, by 2050 HS2 direct services via NPR will create an additional 24,000 new jobs.\n\nMr Oglesby added: \u201cHS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail are completely interlinked and a joined-up approach is required to both and the upgrades to existing lines.\n\n(Image: Colin Lane/Liverpool Echo)\n\n\u201cOnly by delivering an integrated high-speed network right across the North can a Northern Powerhouse vision be truly realised.\n\n\u201cFurther delays and uncertainty are hugely damaging to North and the country as a whole.\u201d\n\nNorthern Powerhouse Partnership director Henri Murison said: \u201cTo truly rebalance Britain, by building the Northern Powerhouse, we need substantially increased capacity on our rail network.\n\n\u201cThe benefits of Northern Powerhouse Rail and HS2 together are greater than either scheme alone and cancellation of either east and/or western leg without a proven and credible alternative could leave us with no way to secure the economic competitiveness we need, which alongside productivity gains, is a prerequisite of rebalancing the British economy.\u201d\n\nHS2 review chairman Douglas Oakervee\u2019s report is due to be published by the end of the year.\n\nA Department for Transport spokesman said: \u201cThe independent review into HS2, led by Douglas Oakervee with Lord Berkeley as deputy and a panel of advisers, will provide the government with clear advice on how and whether the project should proceed.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cAs the Prime Minister recently set out, this Government wants to drive growth across the North including through Northern Powerhouse Rail and giving local leaders a greater say in the running of the railway.\n\n\u201cWe will also publish a White Paper on the recommendations of the Williams Review, ensuring we deliver the reforms that will give passengers a punctual, modern and reliable railway.\u201d", "description": "The Northern Powerhouse Partnership revealed the potential bonanza as a review of the rail scheme is underway", "authors": ["Ben Glaze", "Image", "Evening Gazette", "Getty", "Colin Lane Liverpool Echo", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18069994.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Northern-train-ed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
