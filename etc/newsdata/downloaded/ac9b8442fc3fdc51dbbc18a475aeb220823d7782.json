Photo: Courtesy of TIFF\n\nLucy in the Sky, directed by Noah Hawley and starring Natalie Portman, is a late premiere at this year\u2019s Toronto International Film Festival. The Marriage Story folks, exquisite, have probably come and gone; the Hustlers women are doing press in New York with rave reviews already secured; The Goldfinch is Goldfinch-ing. But what of Lucy in the Sky, which has its world premiere here on Wednesday night? All week, TIFF crowds were buzzing: Would Lucy in the Sky deliver? And also, would Natalie Portman wear a diaper?\n\nBoy, do I have news for you. Fetch me my legal action blouse. Let me speak to someone\u2019s manager. I come back to America on Friday, and I will march from JFK straight to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. Natalie Portman does not \u2014 I repeat, does not \u2014 wear a diaper in the astronaut-love-triangle movie Lucy in the Sky, and for that I am filing suit. My attorney (who also doubles as my father) has been notified. I will not take this lying down!\n\nIn the first minutes of Lucy in the Sky, the movie reminds you that it\u2019s \u201cbased on true events.\u201d Lucy keeps the rough outlines of what really happened in real-life astronaut Lisa Nowak\u2019s life before she confronted her astronaut boyfriend in an Orlando parking lot: Lucy Cola was in the Navy, but always dreamed about going to space. She\u2019s brilliant and focused, and married to a man who also works at NASA, but he\u2019s not an astronaut; she\u2019s having an affair with another NASA employee who is an astronaut. The astronaut/lover starts an affair with another astronaut in their program, and Lucy drives cross-country with a gun, a wig, and a trench coat. Some of the details are a little different on screen \u2014 Lucy doesn\u2019t have kids in the movie, her cinematic trip starts in Houston and ends in San Diego (not Florida, as in real life), and Natalie-as-Lucy uses wasp spray instead of pepper spray. But in broad strokes, it\u2019s Nowak\u2019s story.\n\nLucy in the Sky is the astronaut-love-triangle movie you\u2019ve surely heard about. Natalie Portman stomps around Houston in cowboy boots and with a Texas accent as Lucy Cola, a high-achieving NASA astronaut obsessed with one thing: getting to space. But things get a little twisted for Lucy just after we meet her, when she\u2019s just returned from a mission. Seeing the whole world \u2014 her whole world, our whole world \u2014 is enough to send anyone into a tailspin. What cinches it is that Lucy starts having an affair with hot astronaut Mark (Jon Hamm, described by one character as \u201ca divorced action figure who likes to go fast\u201d), who suffers the inevitable white-man-with-no-lips disease: he lies to her and cheats on her, and Lucy doesn\u2019t want to let that go.\n\nThis movie is imperfect, but Lucy in the Sky tees up the pivotal moment perfectly. Lucy storms around every setting, and late one night she reaches a rupture: She and her teen niece get in her car and drive to the store in the middle of the night. Lucy pushes a shopping cart around the store, barking orders: They need duct tape, rope, a knife. She drops wasp spray into the cart; her eye catches a blonde wig and she drops that in the cart, too. The movie takes Lucy and her existential crisis seriously, but still the moment has an undercurrent of humor. The scene has plenty of laughs, so why couldn\u2019t the diaper be one of the laughs, too? Lucy is so small and everything else \u2014 a death in the family, her affair, her marriage, NASA, her ambitions, space \u2014 is so big and overwhelming. The scene is a punchline for how comically impossible this all is \u2026 what\u2019s she gonna do, drive to San Diego and bully Jon Hamm, who\u2019s there on a trip with his new girlfriend, Zazie Beetz, into taking her back? Well, yes. Of course she is.\n\nBut I can\u2019t stress enough how much this moment needs \u2014 demands \u2014 that diaper. Oh, what could\u2019ve been! Why couldn\u2019t the diaper just have been one more addition to her shopping cart, a winking acknowledgement of her utter seriousness and intensity about her road trip, which she treats as a mission. Lucy makes countdowns, synchronizes watches, says a lot of numbers and does a lot of mental math to calculate her exact arrival. Couldn\u2019t we have thrown a diaper somewhere in there? \u201cGiven that it\u2019s not a documentary, part of the work I did was trying to create a character journey that you could really relate to and stay with, even when she went to places you didn\u2019t want her to go,\u201d Noah Hawley told the Los Angeles Times, ostensibly explaining his error. \u201cThat detail just didn\u2019t fit into the story.\u201d Lucy in the Sky could imprison Natalie Portman in Claire Foy\u2019s First Man hair, but a diaper didn\u2019t fit into the narrative. With all due respect: what in the hell!\n\nThe year 2019 has given us our share of instantly iconic onscreen stunts: Meryl Streep\u2019s Big Little Lies teeth, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s The King bowl cut, Brad Pitt taking off his shirt in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. Oh, Natalie Portman\u2019s astronaut diaper, I am mourning your loss even though I never knew you.", "description": "Lucy in the Sky, directed by Noah Hawley and starring Natalie Portman, was a late premiere at this year\u2019s Toronto International Film Festival.
