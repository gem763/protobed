Premium cards, on the other hand, usually do charge fees to add a partner, family member, or spouse to your account. It can be worth paying the fee, though, because authorized users on premium credit cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve or Amex Platinum can get benefits like airport lounge access and even hotel elite status.\n\nIf you're considering paying to add an authorized user to your credit card, it makes sense to perform a cost/benefit analysis first, taking into account your personal situation. It's also essential to fully understand the risks and benefits of adding an authorized user.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nWhat is an authorized user?\n\nAdding an authorized user to your existing account is different than them setting up their own account. Authorized users aren't the main account holder; instead, they're using a credit card that's tied to the main account. Being added as an authorized user means the main account holder is assuming the risk.\n\nAlthough the bank will have identifying information for the other person, the account will usually be reported on both your and their credit report. And although they may have the ability to make payments to the account from their own bank account, you are ultimately responsible for paying the bill.\n\nRead more: How to build credit to increase your credit report and score\n\nAccordingly, adding an authorized user isn't something to be taken lightly. However, in many situations, this is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Some issuers, such as Amex, allow you to set a credit limit (even as low as $200) to limit your risk exposure.\n\nThe benefit for the authorized user is that they can build credit this way \u2014 since the main account holder's payments will be added to the authorized user's credit report, if they're starting from zero this can help them develop good credit and eventually pave the way to them getting approved for credit cards and other financial accounts of their own.\n\nBeing added as an authorized user vs. getting your own account\n\nGetty Images\n\nThere are two primary reasons to add an authorized user to an existing credit card account versus setting up a new account: cost savings and access.\n\nCost Savings\n\nWhen it comes to premium credit cards with high annual fees, it can be much less expensive to add an authorized user to an existing account than to set up a separate account and pay the card's full annual fee. For example, the Chase Sapphire Reserve has a $450 annual fee, but each authorized user costs only $75. Given that many of the same card benefits apply both to authorized users and the primary account, it can make sense to save the money.\n\nAuthorized users won't receive a sign-up bonus, but purchases authorized users make will earn you rewards.\n\nRead more: The best rewards credit cards that let you add an authorized user for free\n\nAccess\n\nFor people who are building or rebuilding credit, getting approved for a premium credit card usually isn't a possibility in the short term. These products are typically reserved for those with above-average incomes and credit history.\n\nHowever, credit history isn't a factor that a card issuer considers when you add an authorized user. You can add anyone who is over the age of 18 as an authorized user to your account with any bank, and the activity on your account will be reported on their credit report. Some banks will even allow you to add an authorized user under 18 to your account.\n\nRead more: The credit score you need to open popular rewards credit cards\n\nThe best premium credit cards for adding authorized users\n\nWhen you add an authorized user, most (though not all) of the benefits of the premium card product apply to an authorized user's card and the purchases they make with it.\n\nCost to add an authorized user: $75 per authorized user\n\nIncluded benefits:\n\nPriority Pass Select membership for airport lounge access\n\n3x points on dining and travel\n\nPrimary car rental insurance and the rest of the card's coverage and insurance benefits\n\nSubtracted benefits:\n\nNo separate $300 annual travel credit (but purchases are counted against the primary account's $300-per-year travel credit).\n\nNo additional Global Entry fee credit, although the primary account's Global Entry fee credit can be used by the authorized user.\n\nCost to add an authorized user: $175 for up to 3 authorized Platinum users, then $175 for each additional one after that; $0 per authorized Gold user\n\nIncluded benefits:\n\nAirport lounge access, including Centurion Lounges, Priority Pass Select membership, and Delta Sky Clubs when flying Delta\n\nGold elite status with Hilton and Marriott\n\nUp to $100 to cover the application fee for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck\n\nSubtracted benefits:\n\nFor Amex Platinum authorized user cards:\n\nNo airline fee credit of up to $200 per year No Uber credits (up to $200 per year) No Saks Fifth Avenue credits (up to $100 per year)\n\nFor the free Gold cards, nearly all premium benefits are subtracted except category bonuses for spending and Global Entry fee reimbursement. Standard Gold-level benefits, such as secondary rental car insurance, do still apply.\n\nCost to add an authorized user: Free for up to 5 authorized users; $35 per user above 5\n\nIncluded benefits:\n\n4x points on restaurants worldwide, 4x points at US supermarkets up to $25,000 per year (then 1x)\n\n3x points on flights booked directly with airlines or Amex Travel\n\nRead more: The American Express Gold Card has a $250 annual fee, but two benefits alone get you $220 in value\n\nSubtracted benefits:\n\nNo airline fee credit of up to $100 per year\n\nNo dining credits of up to $120 per year\n\nNo Amex Travel Collection membership\n\nBottom line\n\nPremium credit card benefits can be extremely valuable. For example, Chase and Amex both offer a full Priority Pass Select membership for each authorized user. Have a family of four? By adding your partner as an authorized user and signing up for a second Priority Pass membership, the whole family will be able to access Priority Pass lounges when you take a trip \u2014 since you're generally limited to two guests per Priority Pass account.\n\nWith the Amex Gold, it's a total no-brainer for the first five authorized users. There's no fee, and any spending at supermarkets, restaurants, or on airfare earns outsize bonuses. You'll want to maximize these categories as much as possible.\n\nAdding someone as an authorized user to the Chase Sapphire Reserve or the Amex Platinum can be a tougher decision, because there's so much value to be had as a primary account holder with these two cards. But if someone wouldn't be able to be approved for either of these higher-end credit cards, gaining access as an authorized user could be an excellent decision, allowing them to enjoy some great perks while also helping them build credit.\n\nMore credit card coverage", "description": "While it is important to be careful when adding an authorized user to your credit card, it can make sense in some situations.
