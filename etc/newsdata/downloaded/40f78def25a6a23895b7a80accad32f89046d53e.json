The Yushin regime was destroyed, but the military dictatorship continued under the next ruler, leading to bigger sacfices in the May 18th Gwangju democratization movement and others. So commemorating the Busan-Masan protests as an official national day is acknowledging the fact it contributed to Korea's democratization.\"The Busan-Masan protests led ultimately to the system of direct elections in 1987.This year's inaugural ceremony will take place at Kyungnam University, where the Masan protests began.Choi Jeong-yoon, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
