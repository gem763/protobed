Unlike its neighbors, Martinque and Guadeloupe, it is conspicuously undeveloped. Most of the rugged, mountainous island is lush with thick jungle, with a few small towns dappled in. It is also lacking, strangely for its region, in beaches.\n\nBut the country of Dominica\u2013not to be confused with the Dominican Republic\u2013exhibits its beauty not in white-sand beaches (though there are some) but in its spectacular geological wonders: canyons, hot springs, mountain trails, ocean cliffs, thriving reefs. Increasingly, as the luxury travel industry takes interest, there are ways to relax on Dominica. But the real draw of the place lies elsewhere. As the country\u2019s preeminent historian Lenox Honeychurch once put it, \u201cDominica is an island for travellers and adventurers rather than for those who like their pleasures manicured and tame.\u201d\n\nJust under 300-square-miles, Dominica lies, egg-shaped, in the Lesser Antilles, not far from Venezuela. It was originally known by its indigenous name, Wai\u2019tukubuli. Nicolo Syllacio, a chronicler on Columbus \u2019 second voyage, wrote upon passing it, in 1493, that its beauty \u201cmust be seen to be believed.\u201d Geologically it is the youngest island in the West Indies, still being formed, in fact, by geothermal activity, though its several volcanoes are dormant. Visitors have numerous opportunities to witness this up-close, in its hot-springs, hot-sand beaches or at the Boiling Lake, the world\u2019s second largest hot-spring (too hot for touching, it requires a strenuous hike).\n\nMore so than surrounding islands, Dominica\u2019s history has been intimately shaped by its physical makeup. During the colonial period, it served as a crucial sanctuary for escaped slaves, who were able to hide out in its rugged interior. First settled by the French, it became a British colony in 1805, though a much neglected one. That feeling of isolation and self-reliance continued on from independence, in 1978, into today. Though ravaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017, the country, largely recovered, is ready for visitors.\n\nThe view from the Fort Young Hotel. Discover Dominica Authority\n\nSTAY\n\nDominica has seen a recent spate of five-star openings. For pampered solitude with spectacular coastal views and access, make a stay at Secret Bay, an award-winning boutique resort with six tastefully designed villas. If in Rosseau, the capital and Dominica\u2019s largest city, book a night at the historic Fort Young Hotel, located right on the water, near the city\u2019s charming French Quarter. This fall will see the opening of the much-anticipated Cabrits Resort and Spa Kempinski Dominica. A stunning property surrounded by a national park, with its own private beach, it will be the first international luxury hotel brand to open on Dominica. For something less high-end but still tastefully refined, check out Pagua Bay House; splendid ocean views, exquisite eats and it\u2019s near the airport.\n\nEAT\n\nIn Dominican cuisine, unsurprisingly, seafood shines. Particularly good is the local mahi-mahi and yellow-fin tuna. Try the latter at The Palisades, a luxurious, open-air restaurant above Fort Young Hotel, with their Hot Rock Tuna, raw slices served alongside a super-heated stone for self-cooking. Make time for Zing Zing, Secret Bay\u2019s menuless restaurant run by the uber-talented South African chef Grant Lynott. At the Jungle Bay Resort, a mountainside getaway popular for yoga retreats, experience lovely, pristinely fresh dishes from the Dominican head chef Joanne Hilaire, as well as delightful varieties of homemade rum punch. For a genuinely local spot with fantastic eats, such as fried breadfruit and curried lentils, check out Le Petit Paradis, in Wotten Waven.\n\nThe Indian River Tour. Discover Dominica Authority\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nDominica is practically designed for exploration. Do it with Wanderlust Caribbean, a stately new eco-lodge and tour provider run by husband and wife Tom and Sharie Decherd from North Carolina. Passionate and highly knowledgeable about the island, they offer numerous adventure trips, from sea kayaking to mountaineering to horseback riding. For a reputable scuba and snorkel outfit, try Nature Island Dive, located in the south, near some of the islands best dive spots.\n\nOn the more go-getter end of touristic experience, check out Extreme Dominica\u2019s canyoning experience, which features waterfall rappelling, cliff jumping, and wet-rock scrambling among river crabs. For a pristine beach that is often deserted, there is Batibou, which requires a long, pleasant walk through the forest. To explore Dominica, with its twisty and often steep roads, it is best to hire a local driver. Ask your hotel concierge for Beno Pascal, who comes highly recommended.\n\nThe writer was a guest of Discover Dominica.", "description": "The Caribbean island is known less for its beaches than its geological wonder", "authors": ["Brent Crane"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-107046/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
