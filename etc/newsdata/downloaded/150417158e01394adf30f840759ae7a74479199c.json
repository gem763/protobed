While you may think your online identity will go to the grave with you, that\u2019s not always how it works out.

Depending on what Google products you use, the tech giant knows more than just your questionable internet search history. There\u2019s Google Pay where your bank information is stored, there\u2019s also Google Photos where your memories live on, and potentially important documents in your Google Drive.
