The operation is all booked in. I think when you have big boobs, they can make you look bigger and I would just love to never ever wear a bra again.\"\n\nIt comes after Gemma reportedly told on/off boyfriend James 'Arg' Argent that their relationship is over until he sorts out his problems.\n\nArg was recently the subject of a police welfare check at his Essex home, after Gemma raised the alarm following 12 hours of him not returning her calls.\n\nPolice and paramedics turned up at his home to check up on him, but Arg later explained it was a \"misunderstanding\".\n\n(Image: SplashNews.com)\n\n\"I didn't have my phone on me because it was charging downstairs. I have put her [Gemma] through a lot so I completely understand her worry,\" he told OK! magazine.\n\n\"She remembers what she\u2019s been through in the past with me so she thought the worst.\"\n\nArg, who was axed from TOWIE over failing a drugs test, added that he is struggling with binge-eating and is working with a therapist to address his relationship with food.\n\n\"My biggest problem is my eating disorder. I have always struggled with it since my teens,\" he said.\n\n\"When I'm in a bad place I binge eat, and when I put on weight it then triggers more issues.\"", "description": "Gemma Collins has been losing weight in an attempt to get a boob job early next year - and wants to end up at 12 stone", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Instagram", "Splashnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20754991.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Gemma-Collins.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
