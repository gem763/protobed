REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo\n\n\u201cWe follow our customers where they shop,\u201d Bogliolo said in an interview.\n\nA lower domestic sales tax has also contributed to double-digit decreases in sales to Chinese tourists in the United States and in other destinations, he said, reflecting an effort by China\u2019s government to \u201crepatriate consumption\u201d by its citizens.\n\nBogliolo spoke after a luncheon put on by Boston College\u2019s Carroll School of Management. Among the inventory moved abroad, he said, has been high-end jewelry like diamond necklaces valued at $1 million and up. In the past, more of these types of pieces were purchased by wealthy Chinese travelers in New York or Paris, he said.\n\nTiffany shares were trading around $89 each on Thursday, well below the closing high of $139.50 they reached in July 2018. New York-based Tiffany is among a group of luxury brands grappling with the U.S.-China trade war, along with lost business due to the protests that have rocked Hong Kong since summer, forcing malls to shut.\n\nThe protests have led to a rising number of store closings in the Chinese-controlled territory, Bogliolo said, without giving a precise figure. \u201cWe hope for a positive resolution of the protests, but it\u2019s not improving at all,\u201d he said.\n\nHong Kong accounts for up to 10% of the estimated $285 billion annual global market for luxury goods. Other brands under pressure include Swatch Group, Cartier-owner Richemont and France\u2019s Hermes.\n\nIn their ongoing trade war, Washington and Beijing have levied punitive duties on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods, roiling financial markets and threatening global growth.\n\nBogliolo said he could not forecast how long tensions might continue but said he aimed to \u201cact on what is in our control.\u201d\n\nThe company last month opened an exhibit of its jewelry at Shanghai\u2019s Fosun Foundation, for instance, and Bogliolo said he wants to avoid charging Chinese consumers extra to cover the costs of tariffs on jewelry it imports into the country.", "description": "Tiffany & Co is sending more of its priciest jewelry to mainland China to reach consumers kept at home by a weak currency, Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Ross Kerber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436794368&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921R7"}
