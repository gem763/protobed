On the contrary, last Friday, investors had a large enough excuse to sell stocks into the weekend, but buyers materialized in the waning moments of the session.\n\nBad News: Oomph\n\nThe lack of oomph continues to haunt the market, which has meandered in the shadows of the all-time high for weeks, and now can\u2019t find a way to get over the hump. Yesterday, the market shook off anxiety and a big miss on the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index (PMI). It looked as if the Dow Jones Industrial Average could rally 200 points. The index and overall market faded into the close.\n\nBuying was evenly distributed with Technology leading the way.\n\nS&P 500 Index +0.50% Communication Services (XLC) +0.51% Consumer Discretionary (XLY) +0.86% Consumer Staples (XLP) +0.49% Energy (XLE) -0.72% Financials (XLF) -0.25% Health Care (XLV) +0.90% Industrials (XLI) +0.14% Materials (XLB) +0.85% Real Estate (XLRE) +0.13% Technology (XLK) +1.05% Utilities (XLU) +0.06%\n\nThe Tables Have Turned: Value is Momentum and Momentum is Value\n\nHome Sweet Home\n\nHomebuilders have become a momentum juggernaut, driving the U.S. Home Construction Index +44.2% year-to-date, and appear to have a lot more room to the upside.\n\nD.R. Horton Inc DHI 13.62%\n\nLennar Corp LEN 11.80%\n\nNVR Inc NVR 9.86%\n\nPulteGroup Inc PHM 6.99%\n\nLowe's Inc LOW 4.92%\n\nHome Depot HD 4.84%\n\nSherwin-Williams SHW 4.70%\n\nToll Brothers Inc TOL 3.88%\n\nMasco Corp MAS 2.96%\n\nTop Build Corp BLD 2.59%\n\nITB Index\n\nChipping Away\n\nAn index that\u2019s changing hands at a forward price-to-earnings (forward P/E) ratio of 44.9% isn\u2019t exactly a value, but semiconductors have been in enough of a rut lately. Some are wondering if they are oversold.\n\nYesterday, two separate analysts, both citing trips to Asia, voiced cautious optimism that chip demand is better than many believe, and trade developments could have an immediate positive impact.\n\nNVIDIA Corp NVDA 8.57%\n\nTexas Instruments TXN 8.23%\n\nQualcomm Inc QCOM 8.07%\n\nBroadcom Inc AVGO 7.79%\n\nIntel Corp INTC 7.46%\n\nMicron Technology MU 4.81%\n\nApplied Materials AMAT 4.30%\n\nLam Research Corp LRCX 4.18%\n\nNXP Semiconductors NXPI 4.02%\n\nKLA Corp KLAC 4.00%\n\nPhiladelphia Semiconductor Index\n\nParade of the Penguins\n\nToday sees the start of another week of jawboning from Federal Reserve officials. Yesterday in Asia, Charles Evans seemed more open to lower rates, so perhaps he can move the needle. Or perhaps someone else will, as they have had a chance\u2026or two.", "description": "It was a pretty good Monday session that saw the .10/01/2019 20:31:11PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/208/97ea371f-776f-4289-8366-b2e67a0768f8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
