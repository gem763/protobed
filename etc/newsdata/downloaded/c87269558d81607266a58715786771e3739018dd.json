It\u2019s been too long,\u201d said no studio development executive, ever.\n\nBut of course, absurd as the idea may seem, some attempts to wring humor from the horrors of Nazi Germany have stood the test of time: Charlie Chaplin\u2019s \u201cThe Great Dictator,\u201d Ernst Lubitsch\u2019s \u201cTo Be or Not To Be,\u201d Mel Brooks\u2019 \u201cThe Producers,\u201d and Roberto Benigni\u2019s \u201cLife Is Beautiful,\u201d to name a few.\n\nNow comes the boldly, unabashedly quirky \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d by New Zealand director Taika Waititi, who attempts this fiendishly difficult balancing act at a time when Nazi jokes seem even more potent and dangerous than a few decades ago.\n\nAnd that is precisely the point, Waititi says: Now, especially now, is the time to remind younger generations of what happened more than 70 years ago. And what better tool, as Brooks has posited, than humor? That\u2019s his argument, anyway.\n\nWhether you agree or not - and indeed, many may not - it helps to know where the director is coming from, personally. He is both Jewish, through his mother, and Maori, through his father. He has spoken of experiencing prejudice as a child, and says he\u2019s always been interested in stories told through the eyes of children.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what he does in \u201cJojo Rabbit,\u201d which, though it features high-profile names like Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell, is anchored by a hugely sympathetic young actor, Roman Griffin Davis, as a 10-year-old boy trying to be the very best Nazi he can.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe this is young Roman\u2019s film debut; he manages to exude both a youthful whimsy and a sense of aplomb that belies his age. It\u2019s also hard to imagine the film succeeding without such a sensitive and winning performance at its core.\n\nWe meet Jojo toward the end of the war, in the fictional town of Falkenheim. (The film is based on the 2004 novel \u201cCaging Skies,\u201d by Christine Leunen.) He lives with his mother, Rosie (Johansson), a spunky and radiant free spirit with, we will learn, a major secret.\n\nBut really, Jojo lives with Adolf Hitler.\n\nYes, Hitler\u2019s his imaginary friend, sort of his Nazi life coach, as the young boy prepares to don his uniform and join the Jungvolk of the Hitler Youth, where youngsters are indoctrinated into the cause. Hitler is played here by Waititi himself as more of a benignly goofy, gangly misfit than, well, the real thing. (He says he wasn\u2019t his own first choice for the role; actors weren\u2019t clamoring to be Hitler.)\n\nAt training camp, Jojo\u2019s commander is the preposterously thickheaded Captain Klenzendorf (a predictably amusing Rockwell, who knows from thickheaded characters), aided by his equally misguided assistants, Finkel and Fraulein Rahm. The latter is played by Rebel Wilson, as intentionally incongruous in a World War II film as you\u2019d imagine. \u201cI\u2019ve had 18 kids for Germany,\u201d she declares to the young girls, who are expected to do the same.\n\nJojo is ordered to demonstrate his Nazi credentials by wringing the neck of a rabbit. He can\u2019t bring himself to kill the poor thing, and runs away into the forest, humiliated.\n\nHe tries to redeem himself, but soon he\u2019ll face an even more shocking challenge. In a closet, he discovers that his own mother has been secretly harboring his worst enemy, the villain he\u2019s been taught to despise above all others: the Jew. Only this one\u2019s name is Elsa, and she\u2019s young and beautiful. And he can\u2019t find her horns, or any signs of evil powers.\n\nJojo\u2019s first instinct is to alert the Nazis about Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie, the lovely New Zealand actress who recalls a young Nicole Kidman). But he soon realizes he and his mother would likely be killed, too. And so he slowly gets to know her.\n\nWhere does the Queen Jew lay her eggs, he asks? Do you live in caves? Sometimes, she allows, \u201cWe hang from the ceiling.\u201d Gradually, the two become closer. Elsa tries to get Jojo to realize he\u2019s not really a Nazi - just a 10 year-old \u201cwho likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club.\u201d\n\nA tragedy late in the film will severely test the deepening relationship between the two. But the war will eventually end, with drastic implications for every character. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a good time to be a Nazi,\u201d notes Jojo\u2019s young buddy Yorki drily, as the regime collapses around them.\n\nIs it now, or ever, a good time for a Nazi-themed comedy? That\u2019s as difficult a question to answer as it ever was. But Waititi injects enough heart and wit into this enterprise to make a case that artists like him should at least be trying to find creative ways to educate new generations about the horrors of the past.\n\n\u201cJojo Rabbit,\u201d a Fox Searchlight release, has been rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America \u201cfor mature thematic content, some disturbing images, violence, and language.\u201d Running time: 108 minutes. Three stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nMPAA definition of PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned.
