The summer\u2019s accessible financing released a surge of first-time homebuyers into the market but that drives up home prices and reduces the supply of low-cost starter homes on the market, said Fleming.\n\n\u201cAll those millennials who we thought weren\u2019t ever gonna buy homes are now demanding homes,\u201d said Fleming, citing a recent TransUnion report, which projected a surge of first-time homebuyers over the next three years. \u201cAll else equal, if rates go down, I can afford to buy more. So, I go and I bid against all my fellow first-time homebuyers, and the price gets escalated. And so the result is higher numbers.\u201d\n\nHome-price appreciation is re-accelerating after a 16-month slowdown, according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index.\n\nHomebuyers are having a hard time finding affordable homes on the market. Availability of homes under $200,000 has been shrinking since 2014, and analysts predict that homes in the $200,000 to $750,000 range also dwindled in October.\n\nAnd the problem will only get worse, according to Fleming, noting that about two-thirds of American households are already homeowners. Low rates led to a refinancing boom and as homeowners lock in low mortgage rates, they will have less incentive to move and sell their existing homes.\n\n\u201cWhen or if rates go up again, that lock-in effect means they\u2019ll want to stay put,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cThey won\u2019t want to move, and it really leaves that proverbial next generation out in the cold.\u201d\n\nSarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
