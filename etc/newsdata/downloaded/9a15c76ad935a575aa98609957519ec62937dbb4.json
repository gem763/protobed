For the Justice Department, the verdict is a blow to its efforts to ramp up prosecution of foreign lobbying cases.\n\nA jury of nine men and three women returned the verdict after nearly four hours of deliberation, ending the three-week trial in Washington. Prosecutors presented 16 witnesses while the defense offered five \u2014 Mr. Craig and four character witnesses.\n\nUpon hearing the acquittal, Mr. Craig hugged his attorneys and beamed a huge smile even as he was on the verge of tears. He was overcome with emotion while speaking to reporters outside the courthouse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank the jury for their service and for justice in this case. I\u2019m grateful to them in so many ways,\u201d he said before thanking his family and attorneys for their support.\n\nShortly after the verdict, Mr. Craig\u2019s attorneys assailed the Justice Department for still pursuing the case even though federal prosecutors in New York had decided against it.\n\n\u201cThe question that you need to ask isn\u2019t why this jury acquitted Greg Craig, but why the Department of Justice brought this case against an innocent man in the first place,\u201d said attorney William Taylor. He said the department decided \u201cit had to hound this man and his family without any evidence and without any purpose.\u201d\n\nProsecutors showed no reaction and did not comment after the verdict.\n\nProsecutors said Mr. Craig concealed facts from the Justice Department\u2019s Foreign Agents Registration Act unit in 2013 to avoid registering as a foreign agent of the Ukrainian government. Mr. Craig prepared a politically sensitive report in 2012 evaluating the country\u2019s prosecution of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.\n\nThe government claimed Mr. Craig sought to dodge registering as a foreign agent because he would have to disclose embarrassing details about the project, including that his law firm, Skadden Arps, was paid by a Ukrainian oligarch through an offshore bank account. Such details could have sunk Mr. Craig\u2019s bid to land a high-profile government job, prosecutors alleged.\n\nMr. Craig was also accused of covering up his contacts with journalists, including David Sanger of The New York Times, who received an advance copy of the report before it was published.\n\nAfter the trial one of the jurors, Michael Meyer, 60, said the case turned on the time period in which the Justice Department alleged Mr. Craig had lied to investigators.\n\nBecause of the statute of limitations, the jury could only find Mr. Craig guilty if he omitted facts about his involvement with the Ukrainian project after Oct. 3, 2013.\n\nMr. Meyer said at least some jurors believed Mr. Craig may have lied before that date but said prosecutors did not prove he lied after October 2013.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of people in that room who were disturbed by his behavior before Oct. 3,\u201d Mr. Meyer continued. \u201cNot a lot, but there were some jurors \u2026 but on the very narrow rule of Oct. 3 to Jan. 16, there was no question in the room that he hadn\u2019t done anything during that period that warranted finding him guilty.\u201d\n\nMr. Meyer told reporters he found Mr. Craig to be \u201cvery credible\u201d on the witness stand and believed he was not part of the Ukrainian government\u2019s media strategy to promote the report, which is what would constitute lobbying.\n\n\u201cHe made an offer of \u2018if you were to ask me for it, I would give to you,\u2019 and so he was asked for it,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
