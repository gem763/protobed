Following a joint New York Times and New Yorker investigation in 2017, more than 40 women in Hollywood then spoke up, accusing the film producer of sexual misconduct allegations that spanned three decades as the #MeToo movement gained momentum. They included Cara Delevingne and Angelina Jolie.\n\nPhoto credit: Spencer Platt - Getty Images More\n\n\n\n\n\nMcGowan's latest lawsuit was filed yesterday in California's federal court \u2013 and targets the producer along with his lawyers, David Boies and Lisa Bloom, and the private intelligence firm Black Cube.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe claims Weinstein enlisted Black Cube's investigators to pose as advocates for women. His team then allegedly worked with them to ensure the book was never published by plotting a 'sprawling smear campaign to defraud, malign, and marginalise McGowan'.\n\nBloom, who worked to defend victim's rights before representing Weinstein, says she will fight the actress's claims, while Weinstein called the new allegations 'baseless'. The other defendants also deny any involvement.\n\n'This case is about a diabolical and illegal effort by one of America\u2019s most powerful men and his representatives to silence sexual-assault victims,' the lawsuit says. 'And it is about the courageous women and journalists who persisted to reveal the truth.'\n\n\n\nAs news broke of McGowan's legal action, she told her 637,000 Instagram followers she was 'preparing for the smear campaign to begin again'.\n\nDefiantly captioning a photo of The Hollywood Reporter's coverage of the story, she wrote: 'If you start reading horrible things about me on Instagram, Twitter or FB, understand that they are likely bots being paid for to damage my reputation.\n\n'If you start reading sites that trash me, know where it\u2019s coming from, an indicted rapist and his fixers. Stay with me. Believe me. I tell the truth to power, I\u2019ve done it my whole life. I\u2019m not perfect, but I know I am a good person who fights for the voiceless. If it\u2019s happening to me, it can happen to you. Here\u2019s to justice, yours and mine.'\n\nMcGowan pressed ahead with writing her raw and honest autobiography BRAVE. The book was published in January 2018. She chose not to name Weinstein, instead referring to him only as 'Monster' as she described her alleged rape at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThe actress reached a $100,000 settlement with the film producer in 1997, which was 'not to be construed as an admission' by Weinstein, but intended to 'avoid litigation and buy peace'.\n\nWhile McGowan declined to comment for the New York Times article, she subsequently accused Weinstein of rape in a series of tweets, stating overtly what she had long suggested: 'HW raped me'.\n\nWeinstein will stand trial on five charges of non-consensual sex in Manhattan next year.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "She says they posed as 'advocates for women' as part of a 'smear campaign' to stop her book being published.", "authors": ["Natalie Cornish"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AsXW_unSrIwz3QUBEhc4Hw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/7db102920fc9b63e81c13fc2f75cfc81", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
