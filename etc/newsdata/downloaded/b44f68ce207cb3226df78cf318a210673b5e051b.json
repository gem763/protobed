However, he said it was up to the NPA to decide whether more charges will be added.\n\nRamovha said he could not divulge whether any suspects had been questioned by the Hawks or who is under investigation.\n\nIn October 2018, Daily Maverick\u2019s Scorpio reported that a painting by South African painter JH Pierneef, belonging to the Free State provincial government, had gone missing from the Free State premier\u2019s office earlier that year. The artwork has an estimated value of about R8m, according to the publication.\n\nThe painting was allegedly stolen when Magashule was still premier, although he was on his way out, having been elected as ANC secretary general a few months prior.\n\nA former member of Magashule\u2019s security detail reportedly told Daily Maverick that the painting was mistakenly given to him by Magashule as he was helping the former premier clean out his office. He reportedly said this was an \"honest mistake\", and that the artwork was accidentally placed amongst Magashule's things.\n\nHowever, the painting was allegedly passed on to a Bloemfontein businessman, who reportedly took it to an auction house to have it valued. The auction house was reportedly concerned about the painting's origins and called in Pierneef experts to try to locate the painting's true owner.\n\nAn image of the painting was reportedly used by the auction house in an advert calling for consignments for an upcoming auction. This apparently caught the attention of an art expert who alerted provincial government officials that one of their paintings might have been stolen, Daily Maverick reported. The matter was then reported to the Hawks by the auction house's law firm.", "description": "While no arrests have been made, the investigation into how the valuable painting went missing from former Free State premier Ace Magashule's office is complete and the docket has been handed to the NPA.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9118/02a72642f5034f28bd6a8874f05738f5.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
