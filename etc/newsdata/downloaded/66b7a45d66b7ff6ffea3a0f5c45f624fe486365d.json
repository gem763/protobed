Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) in San Francisco, California. Biden was in attendance for the event, which was one of three his campaign had scheduled in the Bay Area on Thursday.\n\nNeither Alexis nor Laurence Pelosi\u2019s attendance at the Biden fundraiser is surprising. Alexis, a documentary filmmaker and journalist, has been cultivating a more liberal profile herself in Hollywood and Washington, DC. Although less overtly political than her mother, her work behind the camera has taken a more ideological turn recently. Two of her better-known documentaries in the past decade have focused on the issues of immigration and the impact large donors have on America\u2019s political system.\n\nThe shift has been noticeable in her campaign donations. Apart from one donation to the House Democrats PAC in 2002, the younger Pelosi made no political contributions until 2016 when she donated to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed presidential campaign. Since then, she has donated to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and made several smaller contributions to progressive candidates and causes. Alexis donated $1,000 to Biden\u2019s campaign on April 25, the day he announced his candidacy.\n\nLaurence, on the other hand, as the founder of an investment firm specializing in real estate, is lesser-known among the public. He has, however, been contributing to Democrat candidates and causes since at least 1993. Like his cousin, Laurence also donated $1,000 to Biden\u2019s campaign on the day of the former vice president\u2019s announcement. It is unclear if either has donated further to Biden, as the Federal Election Commission (FEC) has yet to make records available for the third quarter of this year.\n\nEven though the Pelosis attendance at a fundraiser on Biden\u2019s behalf is not remarkable, the same cannot be said of the timing. The fundraiser comes less than two weeks after Nancy Pelosi launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s conduct with Ukraine. The act, which is the first step in the process of bringing charges against the president, was in response to Trump\u2019s suggestion that the Ukrainian government probe into Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the country. In particular, Trump and others have noted the younger Biden profited from opportunities that were unavailable to ordinary businessmen and seemed to directly intersect with his father\u2019s political influence.\n\nAt the center of the controversy is how Hunter Biden secured an appointment to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil and natural gas giant, in 2014. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as $83,000 per month, despite having no background in the energy industry or Ukraine.\n\nThe younger Biden\u2019s lack of experience, coupled with the fact that his father had just been made the Obama administration\u2019s point man on Ukraine, immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe about a conflict of interest. Furthering the ethical cloud over the appointment is that this came during the same month that Mykola Zlochevsky, Burisma\u2019s founder, had his assets seized in the United Kingdom for suspicion of money laundering. Some have speculated Hunter Biden\u2019s ascension to Burisma\u2019s board was an attempt by Zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings.\n\nA brazen attempt along such lines would not be totally ill-suited for Zlochevsky. The Burisma founder is rumored to be one of eastern Europe\u2019s top oligarchs, a position obtained while serving in the Ukrainian government under former President Viktor Yanukovych \u2014 a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was during his tenure in government as Ukraine\u2019s minister of natural resources that Burisma received its oil and gas licenses\u2013inappropriately, many suspect.\n\nIt is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Biden, who has publicly bragged about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption.\n\nUnofficially, though, it was well known Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster, he was warned to back off of the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled it in 2014.\n\nDespite the strong implications of conflicts of interest and wrongdoing, Nancy Pelosi chose to ignore the storied history of the Biden family\u2019s affairs in Ukraine before choosing to launch her impeachment inquiry. In fact, the rush in which the speaker and her allies in the Democrat leadership moved to launch an inquiry has drawn accusations from President Trump that the entire proceeding is a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Republicans in Congress have echoed the sentiment, noting the speaker chose to ignore precedent by refusing to hold a vote on the impeachment inquiry, and her deputies, such as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), have threatened to charge White House officials with obstruction of justice if they \u201cstonewall\u201d the probe.\n\nFor her part, the speaker has done nothing to shield herself from such criticism and accusations. One day prior to her daughter and nephew attending a fundraiser for Biden, Nancy Pelosi declared during an appearance on ABC News that the \u201cre-election of Donald Trump would do irreparable damage to the United States.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Pelosi did not return requests for comment on this story.\n\nOutside of the immediate impeachment circumstances, the fundraiser also poses questions regarding the speaker\u2019s preference in the race for the 2020 Democrat nomination. Even though Pelosi has made no official endorsement, the fact that her daughter and nephew are backing Biden raises the question if she herself is in the former vice president\u2019s corner.\n\nA review of FEC filings shows that no other member of the speaker\u2019s family has donated to a candidate other than Biden, even though recent polling has shown Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) leads in their home state of California.", "description": "Nancy Pelosi's daughter and nephew hosted a fundraiser for Joe Biden amid the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Joe-Biden-wide-smile-thumbs-up-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
