I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very democratic to seek to overturn a referendum without asking the people first. I really think the only democratic way to get through this and to break the logjam is to go back to the people and trust their good sense.\u201d\n\nMs Swinson responded: \u201cComparing a UK political party to the Taliban is ludicrous. Emily is the shadow foreign secretary, and should use language that reflects the importance of that role.\u201d\n\nAnd Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesperson Chuka Umunna said Ms Thornberry should \u201cwithdraw her inappropriate remarks\u201d.\n\nMr Umunna said: \u201cLanguage counts \u2013 comparing the Lib Dems to a murderous organisation is no laughing matter. It is also grossly insulting to over 23,000 of her constituents who signed the parliamentary petition for Article 50 to be revoked.\u201d\n\nBut former leader Tim Farron adopted a more humorous approach \u2013 while also taking the opportunity to have a swipe at Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s past meetings with representatives of Hezbollah and Hamas \u2013 tweeting: \u201cCome on Emily, if we really were like a Middle East terrorist group, don\u2019t you think Jeremy would\u2019ve invited us to a conference fringe meeting before now?\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In an apparent act of revenge, she was passed over for the stand-in slot when the leader was absent for prime minister\u2019s questions.\n\nBut she played down the snub, telling The House: \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident I\u2019m doing it in the future. It was a decision for Jeremy and Loto [leader of the opposition\u2019s office] to decide, it wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d\n\nAnd she played down the significance of Labour deputy leader Tom Watson\u2019s call for a second referendum before a general election, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s just how he is, isn\u2019t it? I haven\u2019t seen him for a while ... But he\u2019s deputy leader and he can say what he wants.\u201d\n\nMs Thornberry recently got into difficulties on TV trying to explain Labour\u2019s position on Brexit.\n\nBut she defended the position, saying: \u201cWe are now wedded to having a second referendum because so much has changed since three years ago. The question then is what will the choice be. We don\u2019t want to put these lousy Tory choices of no deal or Theresa May\u2019s deal to the public. We want there to be two good choices.\n\n\u201cI would say \u2018anything other than leaving the European Union\u2019 is not a good choice but it would be second best. We need to have a choice that will look after jobs and the economy as best we can, which means being in the customs union and being close to the single market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said we need, before we do finally leave, to have it confirmed with the public; if they do want to leave, this is a way that makes sense, or we remain. It\u2019s important that we\u2019re clear about that, but I\u2019m never going to be able to do anything other than campaign to remain because I think we should be in the EU.\u201d", "description": "Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has sparked fury among Liberal Democrats by comparing Jo Swinson\u2019s party to the Taliban over its\u00a0new policy to cancel Brexit if it wins\u00a0power.
