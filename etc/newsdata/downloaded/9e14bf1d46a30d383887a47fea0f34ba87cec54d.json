Federal prosecutors recommended the low end \u2014 one month with a year of supervised release and a $20,000 fine. Meanwhile, Huffman\u2019s legal team asked the judge to sentence her to one year of probation, a $20,000 fine and community service. So this sentence is on the low end of the guideline.\n\nHuffman \u2014 the first parent to be sentenced in the widespread college admissions scandal \u2014 was accompanied to court by her husband, William H. Macy, as well as a handful of others, including her brother, Moore Huffman Jr.\n\nManeuvering through a crush of police and media, actress Felicity Huffman has arrived at the federal courthouse in Boston.

Prosecutors made the case for Huffman to spend the one month in prison, saying she exhibited \u201cdeliberate and intentional criminal conduct.\u201d They asked that \u201ca message must be sent\u201d and said \u201cimprisonment is the only way to send that message.\u201d\n\nHuffman\u2019s team then made the case for probation and community service. They argued that what she did wasn\u2019t as extreme as some of the other parents. They said she\u2019s already paid a price for this, and say said she shouldn\u2019t receive a harsher sentence than others because she has fame and money.\n\nHuffman, through tears, also spoke in court and apologized for what she did, saying she has \u201ceternal shame\u201d over it. She also apologized to her daughter. The actress told the judge she takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d and was \u201cprepared to accept whatever sentence you deem fit.\u201d\n\nDuring the judge\u2019s ruling, she said Huffman didn\u2019t seek out the scheme \u2014 she had been working with college admissions consultant William \u201cRick\u201d Singer legitimately for a year when Singer suggested the scam. However, she said Huffman still broke the law and added, \u201cTrying to be a good mother does not excuse this.\u201d She ended up giving Huffman a 14-day sentence.\n\nHuffman\u2019s attorneys asked for the sentence to be carried out in California, near her family home and in a low-security prison, and that she be able to self-report to prison.\n\nAfter the verdict, the U.S. Attorney Office for the District of Massachusetts said she can self-report and must do so by Oct. 25. However, the facility has not yet been determined.\n\nHuffman ordered to self report to a facility determined by the Bureau of Prisons on Oct. 25 \u2014 U.S. Attorney MA (@DMAnews1) September 13, 2019\n\nHuffman was arrested in March for the so-called Operation Varsity Blues scam, which saw the elite pay college admissions consultant Singer to get their children into esteemed universities. Huffman, who pleaded guilty in May, admitted to paying Singer $15,000 to have a proctor cheat on her elder daughter Sophia Macy's SAT exam. The 19-year-old was unaware of the scam, prosecutors said.\n\nAfter making her plea deal with prosecutors, Huffman apologized in a statement for breaking the law and said she had \u201cdeep regret and shame\u201d over it.\n\nHuffman submitted 27 letters of support to the judge ahead of the sentencing. One was from her husband, who was also referenced in the criminal complaint, which seemingly suggested he had knowledge of the scheme though was not charged. He wrote that Huffman\u2019s mother was \u201csometimes violent\" with her when she was a child, which made her strive to be a supermom. Though he said that all \u201cexploded\u201d \u2014 as did her relationship with their daughters (also including Georgia, 17) \u2014 when FBI agents showed up at their home with guns drawn to take Huffman to jail in March.", "description": "The \"Desperate Housewives\" actress has been sentenced for her part in Operation Varsity Blues.", "authors": ["Suzy Byrne", "Editor", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rAP26sTTh0Jl0G5z2QYWRg--~B/aD0xODMyO3c9Mjc0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/67710d90-d654-11e9-9adf-4d8a24c41cad", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
