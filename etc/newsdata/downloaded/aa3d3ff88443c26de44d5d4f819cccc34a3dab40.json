Over the weekend, James O\u2019Keefe and his Project Veritas team announced that they were working on a series based on information brought to them by an insider at the network. It\u2019s what you\u2019d expect from staff and management that has become infected with Trump Derangement Syndrome. Most of the top hosts hate Trump. CNN president Jeffrey Zucker hates him as well. So, it\u2019s not shocking that the animus leeches into the programming. Zucker is heard on calls, giving marching orders to focus on impeachment and ignore other stories. He rips Fox News for peddling conspiracy theories and pretty much being fake news, which is just rich coming from this network that\u2019s perpetually in third place. Fox is king. They will never beat them. So, chalk up the trash talk as one coming from an executive that will never reach an audience like that at Fox News.\n\nOther tidbits come from CNN\u2019s floor manager, who described the aura of death that was in the air when Trump won the 2016 election while admitting that the network is partially to blame for Hillary\u2019s loss with the non-stop coverage. Trump got around $2 billion in free media during the 2016 cycle. Floor Director Hiram Gonzalez is caught telling PV\u2019s insider, \u201cBetween you and I, we created this monster and now we\u2019re eating him full plate every single day. Media created the Trump monster.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, CNN\u2019s media coordinator admits that top hosts at the network, Jake Tapper, Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon, and Chris Cuomo, either hate or strongly dislike the president. Again, no shocker there (via PV):\n\n\n\n\n\nCary Poarch, who works at CNN\u2019s Washington D.C. Bureau, tells Project Veritas \u201cI decided to wear a hidden camera\u2026to expose the bias running rampant\u201d at the network. Poarch documented CNN\u2019s bias for months; recording undercover footage of numerous long-term employees, some of which talk about Jeff Zucker\u2019s anti-Trump agenda. In the video are Nick Neville, Christian Sierra, Hiram Gonzalez, David Chalian, and Mike Brevna. These employee\u2019s positions range from media coordinator to high-ranking executives. I decided to secretly record the 9:00am rundown call meetings with senior management and executives, says Poarch. [\u2026] Jeff Zucker has served as president of CNN Worldwide since 2013. In recordings of daily phone calls, Zucker directed staffers to push the impeachment narrative. \u201cI want to stay with this, our top, top \u2013 our own reporters, our own political analysts, the top, the top [unintelligible] we have. Okay, so make sure we\u2019re doing that. All these moves are moves towards impeachment. So, don\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t lose sight of what the biggest story is.\u201d [\u2026] Nick Neville, a CNN Media Coordinator, also opened up to our insider. Neville tells our insider who really controls CNN\u2019s programming, and how much top-down control Zucker exerts: \u201cLike, there are a lot of people who are out here trying to play like, just do what they think is the best journalistic integrity. Then you get on the 9am call and the big boss, Jeff Zucker, f**king tells what to do\u2026.\u201d \u201cJeff Zucker- basically president of CNN has a personal vendetta against Trump. Your own biases are gonna be there. They\u2019re going to seep into what you think, they\u2019re gonna seep into what you say, so if Jeff Zucker like blatantly hates Trump, and he runs CNN (which he does), it\u2019s not gonna be positive (for you guys)\u2026no I mean it\u2019s not gonna be positive for Trump. He hates him. It\u2019s gonna be negative!\u201d\n\nBREAKING: I just walked off the stage in Washington DC where I announced that our next @Project_Veritas #BeBrave insider is from within @CNN.#ExposeCNN pic.twitter.com/TWL79UinaS \u2014 James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 12, 2019\n\nAgain, a lot of you already knew this; CNN has been a liberal bastion since the Bush administration. But now you have evidence from multiple people describing how this whole media operation is just one massive propaganda machine for the Democratic Party. This is the Democrat-media complex, confirmed with admissions from the people who work there.\n\nAnd these clowns wonder why the \u201cCNN sucks\u201d chant remains popular four years later. Well, the Trump voters you so hate aren\u2019t that stupid. In fact, they may be eons ahead of the political elite whose hatred is so intense for Trump, it could earn him another term in the White House because if there is one thing people do often when in the grips of such intense hatred\u2014it\u2019s that they make mistakes\u2014huge mistakes. So, keep at it, CNN. You\u2019re just one massive in-kind contribution to Keeping America Great.", "description": ".10/14/2019 19:18:26PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/259/763525b1-6817-4b27-aac5-4eaed2007251.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
