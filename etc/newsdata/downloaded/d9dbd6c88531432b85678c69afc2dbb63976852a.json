The Mississippi delta city has long been known for its culinary bounty: not just the fusion flavours of creole and Cajun cuisines, but also the formal dining traditions of grand old-school restaurants such as Antoine\u2019s and Galatoire\u2019s.\n\nIn the 14 years of rebuilding that followed the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, a new generation of chefs has put its own spin on the city\u2019s dining scene.\n\nIn New Orleans, seasonal eating isn\u2019t just about produce; it\u2019s also about seafood. \u2014 Brian Landry, Jack Rose\n\nAmong them is Brian Landry, who helms Jack Rose restaurant in the Pontchartrain Hotel, where the theatrical interiors feature velvet banquettes, chandeliers, hanging ferns and a disco ball. Although Jack Rose has a relaxed vibe, Landry says he drew inspiration from some of the city\u2019s more traditional dining rooms.\n\nJack Rose's Caesar Salad is prepared at the table. Randy Schmidt\n\n\u201cGrowing up and experiencing restaurants like Galatoire\u2019s, it felt like anything could happen at any moment. We want to capture that feel, to build moments into the menu,\u201d he says.\n\nNothing on Landry\u2019s simple-sounding menu is quite what it seems. The Caesar salad is made with kale and shaved cauliflower; the chicken parmigiana is an extraordinarily juicy, extraordinarily crispy fried chicken. Cooked sous vide then crisped in corn starch batter, it is served on a bed of New Orleans\u2019 spicy tomato sauce, with parmesan shaved over the top as you watch.\n\nBrian Landry specialises in serving straightforward dishes that are anything but.\n\nLandry\u2019s menu also reflects his love of local seafood. \u201cThis is where the fresh water from the Mississippi and the salt water from the Gulf of Mexico meet,\u201d he explains. \u201cIn New Orleans, seasonal eating isn\u2019t just about produce; it\u2019s also about seafood. The crawfish season is just coming to an end, blue crab is getting more and more plentiful, so is red snapper.\u201d\n\nLandry may be serving fresh takes on old classics but Greg Sonnier\u2019s restaurant, Gabrielle, is itself a revived classic. The much-loved restaurant had been going for more than a decade when it was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. Although Sonnier always planned to reopen the restaurant, finding new premises proved to be challenging and it was 12 years before Gabrielle opened its doors in a new location in the Trem\u00e9 neighbourhood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSonnier was always known for his Cajun cooking, and the dishes served up in the cheery yellow dining room hold true to that heritage. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to have a gumbo on the menu, or my barbecue shrimp pie, or the roast duck with orange-sherry sauce,\u201d Sonnier says. However, he happily admits to tweaking regional classics.\n\nLandry seeks to create an \"anything could happen at any moment\" vibe at Jack Rose. Christian Horan\n\n\u201cSo many people ask, \u2018Do you have jambalaya?\u2019 that I decided to put it on the menu \u2013 but I do it my way. My family came from Nova Scotia and got kicked out of there, so I thought, how would a chef in Nova Scotia cook jambalaya? I took a shrimp and okra stew and added lobster and langoustines \u2013 that\u2019s my take on a jambalaya.\u201d\n\nSonnier says that while the city\u2019s chefs may be changing the rules, they are sticking with at least one local tradition. What sets New Orleans apart from other cities, he says, is its abiding passion for food. \u201cAs a child we used to go visit relatives in Cajun country and what we would do is eat. All the aunts and uncles were in competition with each other, they all talked about each other\u2019s food. Even while you were eating, you were talking about food. There are not many places in the country where people do that.\u201d\n\nGabrielle is testament to the city's revitalisation post Hurricane Katrina.\n\nNEED TO KNOW\n\nWhere to stay Built into a series of former warehouses, The Eliza Jane hotel enlivens its industrial interiors with dramatic touches such as sweeping velvet curtains.
