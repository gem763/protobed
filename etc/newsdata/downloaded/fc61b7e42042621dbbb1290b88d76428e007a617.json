Anyone caught with more than 600g of heroin or more than 2.5kg of methamphetamine can face the death penalty.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Police in central Vietnam seized nearly a tonne of methamphetamine found abandoned by the side of the road, an officer told AFP, just days after another massive drug bust in the same region.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6163/2d4026e94d5947fc8a64e418843319a0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-18"}
