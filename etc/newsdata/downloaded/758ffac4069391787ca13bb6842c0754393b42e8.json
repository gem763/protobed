The refinery says that the certificates are \u201c100% backed by physical gold stored in a network of central bank-grade vaults,\u201d and claims that \u201cevery ounce of gold [is] held in storage guaranteed by the Government of Western Australia.\u201d\n\nPerth Mint also added that PMGT token holders would be able to physically redeem their tokens for gold whenever they like.\n\nPer the release, the Perth Mint CEO Richard Hayes stated,\n\n\u201cThe digitization of gold via a public ledger is a natural progression for the global commodity markets. It will promote gold as a mainstream asset, enhance its accessibility, and offer greater liquidity, transparency and auditability of the real assets backing this type of digital token.\u201d\n\nAustralia is the world\u2019s second-largest producer of gold. And the companies claim that blockchain technology could help boost gold ownership amongst the general public, both at home and abroad.\n\nHowever, per media outlet ABC, not all experts are convinced of the project\u2019s worth. The media outlet quotes Australian author and futurist Steve Sammartino as saying,\n\n\u201cAs soon as you back a cryptocurrency with a real asset, it actually reduces the value of what the cryptocurrency is. The idea of a cryptocurrency is that no-one owns it or controls it, and the amount of liquidity is determined by mathematics. So as soon as you base it on an asset it actually defeats that purpose.\u201d\n\nBut the chief market strategist of forex trading specialist CMC Markets Michael McCarthy suggested that even if the PMGT token is not a cryptocurrency per se, it still may serve a purpose for many traders. McCarthy said,\n\n\u201cThe blockchain technology is simply a bolt-on here. It\u2019s simply a more convenient way of doing it. But I think that combination of convenience and exposure to a desirable asset could mean that it\u2019s very popular.\u201d\n\nAs reported, in September, Paxos Trust Company, a regulated financial institution that digitizes and mobilizes assets, also launched PAX Gold, a crypto-asset redeemable for physical gold. The token was approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services.", "description": "Australia\u2019s biggest precious metals refinery has teamed up with a blockchain company to launch what they claim is the world\u2019s first token on a public blockchain to be underpinned by government-guaranteed gold reserves.", "authors": ["Tim Alper"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5da/01de409ff3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
