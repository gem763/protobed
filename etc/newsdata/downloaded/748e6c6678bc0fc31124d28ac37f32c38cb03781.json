(Graphic: Johan Jarnestad/The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences)\n\nThe Nobel Foundation has awarded scientists John B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham, and Akira Yoshino the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work developing lithium-ion batteries.\n\nBatteries are over a hundred years old, but, pushed by the oil crisis and a search for fossil fuel-free energy resources, researchers at Exxon, including Whittingham, began to develop rechargeable batteries. Thanks to further work by Goodenough and Yoshino, these batteries now appear in most of our portable electronics in some form and are a frequent topic in the news.\n\nFAA Bans Cargo Shipment Of Lithium Ion Batteries On Passenger Flights The Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation on Wednesday issued an interim rule banning the transportation of lithium ion cells and batteries as cargo on passenger craft, as well as setting a 30 per cent charge limit on ones shipped as air cargo.

When hooked up to a circuit, a spontaneous chemical reaction at the anode produces charge-carrying particles called electrons, which travel through the wire, power the electronics, and are then incorporated via another chemical reaction into the cathode. Recharging the battery requires reversing the reaction to move the electrons back from the cathode to the anode.\n\nWilhelm Sinsteden described the first battery in 1854, and others such as Gaston Plant\u00e9 and even Thomas Edison have worked to develop other batteries using other materials. By the 20th century, scientists were hunting for better materials to produce batteries that could provide more densely packed energy, and they eventually landed on the lithium. But lithium can react with water and air and required further research to tame, according to a Nobel Prize scientific summary. By 1972, the battery science community came together to discuss how they might incorporate lithium into their devices.\n\nBuilding on these advances, Whittingham worked to develop a battery with lithium as the electron-supplying anode, but he needed to find an accompanying cathode that would be able to take up all of those electrons and accommodate the lithium ions produced at the anode. He and his collaborator Fred Gamble at Exxon Research and Engineering Company proposed a sort of layered material called titanium disulfide, which could take up lithium ions between its layers. They produced a working rechargeable battery in 1976. Goodenough\u2019s team at Oxford found another material to serve as the cathode that could produce even higher voltages, called cobalt oxide.\n\nBut there was a problem. Lithium-ion batteries with pure metallic lithium as their anode would develop whiskers of lithium ions that, if they grew all the way to the cathode, would cause the battery to short circuit. They were also reactive and could explode. Researchers needed to find other, safer materials for the anode as well. Yoshino, working at the Asahi Kasei Corporation in Japan, realised that a material called petroleum coke could be filled with lithium ions could serve as the anode. His group presented a battery based on this anode and Goodenough\u2019s cathode, which overcame all these problems and wouldn\u2019t explode if you dropped something on it.\n\nLike yesterday\u2019s physics Nobel Prize, today\u2019s prize is not without its critics. Plenty of influential battery scientists go unrecognised by today\u2019s prize, and this year\u2019s science Nobels have once again managed to award only men, most of them, white.\n\nStill, the objective impact of this year\u2019s prizewinners is obvious, since researchers have continued improving these batteries since then and billions are now in use across the world. Yes, explosions are still a problem. But, as Steingart pointed out, \u201cI\u2019d argue that there would be no Gizmodo to throw snark were it not for the lithium-ion battery.\u201d", "description": "The Nobel Foundation has awarded scientists John B.
