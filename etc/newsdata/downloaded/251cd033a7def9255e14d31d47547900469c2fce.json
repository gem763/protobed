Andrew Cuomo uses uncensored N-word during live interview: 'Pardon my language'", "language": "en", "text": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo might want to avoid his little brother after using an uncensored version of the N-word during a live radio show on Tuesday.\n\nCNN pundit Chris Cuomo, the younger brother of the Democratic governor, famously said being called \u201cFredo\u201d is \u201clike the N-word\u201d for Italians during a viral outburst earlier this year. Fredo is a reference to Fredo Corleone, the weak and facile brother in the movie \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d who was played by John Cazale.\n\nTrump mocks CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo over viral video: \u2018I thought Chris was Fredo also\u2019\n\nThe older Cuomo sibling called into WAMC radio to discuss a variety of topics, including a recent New York Times opinion piece headlined, \u201cHow Italians Became \u2018White.\u201d The governor used the uncensored version of the N-word when discussing the Times piece.\n\n\u201cThey used an expression that Southern Italians were called, I believe they were saying Southern Italians, Sicilians \u2013 I\u2019m half Sicilian \u2013 were called, quote-unquote and pardon my language, but I\u2019m just quoting the Times: \u2018n\u2014r wops,'\u201d Cuomo said without censoring the word.\n\n\u201cN-word wops, as a derogatory comment,\u201d Cuomo continued, using the abbreviation for the second reference.\n\nWAMC's Alan Chartock didn\u2019t comment on Cuomo\u2019s use of the word. In fairness to the governor, the Times did publish the uncensored word itself to describe racist terms used against Italian-Americans \u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop critics from rushing to Twitter with thoughts.\n\nCNN'S CHRIS CUOMO SEEN IN UNVERIFIED VIDEO CURSING AT MAN WHO APPARENTLY CALLED HIM 'FREDO'\n\nBack in August, video of a confrontation the younger Cuomo brother/CNN pundit went viral when the \u201cCuomo Prime Time\u201d namesake threatened a man who apparently had called him \"Fredo.\"\n\nTHIS IS CNN? PRIMETIME SHOWS FILLED WITH LIBERAL OPINION, NOT STRAIGHT NEWS AS NETWORK CLAIMS\n\nA video of the confrontation \u2013which took place at a bar on New York's Shelter Island \u2013 began with the man telling Cuomo, \"I thought that was who you were,\" after referring to his as the fictional character.\n\n\"No, punk-ass b----es from the right call me 'Fredo.' My name is Chris Cuomo. I'm an anchor on CNN,\" Cuomo responded. \"It's a f---ing insult to your people. It's an insult to your f--kin' people. It's like the N-word for us. Is that a cool f---ing thing?\"\n\nThe video has now been viewed nearly 10 million times and President Trump even chimed in.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI thought Chris was Fredo also. The truth hurts,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nCuomo eventually acknowledged that he received support but said he shouldn\u2019t \u201cadd to the ugliness\u201d that he opposes.", "description": "New York Gov.
