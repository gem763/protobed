That shouldn\u2019t be surprising, as income and growth are the keys to profitable investing, but market conditions have been volatile in the last 12 months. With share appreciation unreliable, investors have turned to dividends.\n\nDividends offer the steady income stream that investors want, while the top dividend stocks are available at a relative discount to market prices. According to Cole Hunter, a top strategist with Goldman Sachs, \u201cThe Dividend Growth basket \u2026 now trades at nearly the largest discount to the median S&P 500 stock since 2006.\u201d He has assembled a list of stocks which he expects to both beat the S&P\u2019s average dividend yield by a wide margin, and extend that margin through sustained dividend growth in the coming three years.\n\nWe\u2019ve used TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener tool to further sort Hunter\u2019s list of dividend champs, and find three with Buy ratings and great prospects for mid-term growth.\n\nCitizens Financial (CFG)\n\nThe banking industry has had its ups and downs in recent years. It never really recovered the reputation lost in the 2008 Great Recession, even though most big banks had, by the end of 2009, paid the government back for money received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The long years of low-interest rates from 2009 through 2015, under the Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative easing policy, bit into lending profits but that pressure eased with the return of rate increases in December 2015. The rate cuts earlier this summer bode ill for the banking industry\u2019s loan segments.\n\nAt the same time, however, earnings are up and expected to continue gaining. Citizens Financial, a long-standing name in the US banking industry, exemplifies the conflicting trends the industry faces, and the strength it has to weather the possible storms. With a $15 billion markets cap and more than 1,100 branches in 11 states, CFG ranks 13th in size among American banks. Its $6.13 billion in 2018 revenues led to a net income that year of $1.72 billion and the company\u2019s quarterly earnings have been steady increasing through 2019.\n\nBetter yet, for income investors, CFG offers an annualized dividend yield of 4.05%, more than double the S&P average of 2.01%. The payment, $1.44 per share, is made in quarterly installments of 36 cents. According to Goldman Sachs\u2019 Hunter, CFG\u2019s yield is likely to reach 4.6% by the end of 2020, and through the combination of appreciation and dividends, investors will see an estimated return of 5.1% by 2021.\n\nCFG\u2019s firm position in its industry underlies the stock\u2019s generally favorable reviews from Wall Street analysts. The stock received two Buy ratings last week, from RBC Capital and Evercore ISI.\n\nWriting from RBC, 5-star analyst Gerard Cassidy reiterated his Buy on the stock, and set a $40 price target. As his bottom line, Cassidy said, \u201cEarnings were essentially in line with expectations, reflecting strong fee income, which was led by mortgage banking, slightly lower credit costs and operating expenses. Though the company's fee revenue was strong in the quarter, net interest income was adversely impacted by a lower NIM\u2026 with its 10.3% CET1 ratio, [CFG] is well capitalized.\u201d Cassidy\u2019s target suggests a 12% upside to this stock. (To watch Cassidy's track record, click here)\n\nEvercore\u2019s John Pancari sees a similar path forward for CFG, saying, \u201cCFG\u2019s evolving business model is benefiting from momentum in fee businesses and a greater overall fee contribution \u2013 helping temper the impact of lower rates. CFG remains prudent in actively returning capital. Accordingly, we expect this positioning to continue to present upside to the stock\u2019s discount valuation over time.\u201d\n\nOverall, CFG holds a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, with recent reviews including 2 buys, 1 hold, and 1 sell. Shares are trading at $35.58, so the average price target of $41 gives CFG an upside potential of 15%.
