The music business is littered with people losing the plot.\n\n\"I was already taking trains and driving in Europe, I didn't want to fly any more. I had control over nothing.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n(Image: handout)\n\n\"I'd made enough money to say, 'I don't need to do this.'\"\n\nHe was a millionaire by that point and had more than enough money to take a break from the mad and frantic pop world.\n\nIn 2007, though, he was invited to join an 80s music tribute tour called Here And Now.\n\nRick said he was talked into it by his wife and daughter.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I'd always said I was over it,\" Rick told, \"but I got an offer to go to Japan, and Lene and Emilie wanted to go.\n\n\"It was with the other groups of my era, heritage acts, has-beens, whatever you call us. I loved it.\"\n\nHe's been penning new songs recently, especially during the run-up to his 50th, three years ago.\n\nRecording in his garage and playing every instrument himself, the resulting album went to platinum - and now he's set to release a greatest hits album.\n\nRick dished: \"If the songs are 30 years old, you want to do something different, but people still want them.\"\n\nHe said of his voice: \"It's matured over the years. A great thing about working from home is there's no clock ticking.\n\n\"If I'm in the mood, I'll sing. But if my voice doesn't get any better I'll say, 'Let's leave it as it is.'\n\n\"It's more me, this voice.\"", "description": "Rick rocketed to fame in 1987, but after he had started a family with wife Lene, his perspective on life and his career had shifted", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Getty Images", "Mirrorpix", "Handout"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564883.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Magic-Of-Christmas-At-The-London-Palladium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
