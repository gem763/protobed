While working for ECC, Liolli met her husband and they had one son together.\n\n\"She's easygoing. She's always willing to go with the flow, with a smile on her face,\" said LaDuca. \"Very caring and nurturing. All the students loved her. You can't say a bad word about her.\"\n\nLongtime friend Alysha Cardinale-Soderberg met Liolli in Grade 4 and they were classmates through high school.\n\n\"The bond that we had was more than friends,\" she said.\n\nCardinale-Soderberg said that when she heard about Liolli's death, she thought: \"This feels like someone's sick joke. This doesn't feel real.\n\n\"We're like sisters. We had that relationship where we could just walk into each other's houses and hang out with the family ... even if she wasn't there.\"\n\nThis feels like someone's sick joke. This doesn't feel real. - Alysha Cardinale-Soderberg\n\nCardinale-Soderberg was texting with Liolli the day the hurricane hit, but then Abaco lost power and Cardinale-Soderberg's messages stopped going through.\n\n\"[Her mom and I] were just looking everywhere for information on her,\" she said.\n\nLiolli was in Windsor in August and they went to a Detroit Tigers game with their children.\n\n\"The day before she left, I asked her to be my bridesmaid,\" said Cardinale-Soderberg. \"We hugged and said our goodbyes.\"\n\nAlysha Cardinale-Soderberg and Liolli were best friends since they were in Grade 4.
