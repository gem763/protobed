Lindsey Graham, on Sunday on \u201cAxios on HBO,\u201d told host Jonathan Swan that \u201csure,\u201d he\u2019d support impeachment of Donald Trump \u2014 if in fact it were shown the president had committed an impeachable offense, that is.\n\nAnd from that, all the anti-Trumpers in the media went: One of Trump\u2019s biggest supporters wants to impeach!\n\nThis is why the press registers around zero on the scale of believability. Of course Graham would support impeachment if there were an impeachable crime that had been committed. Saying otherwise would put Graham in the position of defending a criminal \u2014 or, at the very least, of being derelict in his duty to the American people.\n\nThis is how the interview went, CNN reported: Swan asked Graham, \u201cAre you open minded if more comes out that you could support impeachment?\u201d Swan was referring to a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nAnd Graham answered: \u201cSure, I mean show me something that is a crime. If you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s called Speaking The Obvious.\n\nBut from that, came a score of headlines suggesting Graham had sort of, kind of, pretty much turned his back on Trump and was just about, very nearly, almost at the point of impeaching.\n\n\u201cLindsey Graham says he may change his mind on Trump impeachment,\u201d Insider wrote.\n\n\u201cLindsey Graham, one of Trump\u2019s staunchest GOP allies, called the president a \u2018handful\u2019 and suggested he may support impeachment if new evidence comes out,\u201d Business Insider wrote.\n\n\u201cLindsey Graham does not rule out the possibility of Trump impeachment if new evidence emerges,\u201d CNN reported.\n\nCome on, now.\n\nWay, way down into CNN\u2019s story was this tidbit: \u201cA spokesman for Graham on Sunday underscored that the senator has not seen anything yet from Trump that he considers an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nWay, way down into Insider\u2019s story was this: \u201cBut Graham told Axios that he did not consider the cal between Trump and Zelensky to be enough evidence of an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nAnd political watchers know that Graham\u2019s said for some time that he sees nothing impeachable in the July 25 telephone call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nBut the press must have its \u201cimpeach Trump\u201d headline of the day.\n\nThis is a classic example of bias masked as news \u2014 of using a non-story to score political points. And you know why members of the media do this? Because they know most people don\u2019t read past headlines. Most Twitter feeds only post the most titillating of words.\n\nSoon enough, suggestion and innuendo becomes fact.\n\nSoon enough, talk of the political town will be Graham wants to impeach.\n\n\u201cThough Graham has been one of Trump\u2019s most loyal GOP allies, his recent comments suggest that his view of Trump is beginning to slip,\u201d Insider wrote.\n\nOr: Graham\u2019s recent comments suggest that he would do his job as a senator \u2014 but that, in the case of impeachment against this president, he sees absolutely nothing worthy to pursue. To the press, that may be \u201ceh, potatoes, potahtoes.\u201d But to the rest of us? That\u2019s called truth.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
