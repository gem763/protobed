TIDAL says \u201call net proceeds will support voter registration, education, and rights.\u201d But despite its nonpartisan message, it may not be. Keys is an outspoken Trump detractor, characterizing his immigration reforms as \u201czero-humanity policy.\u201d\n\nTIDAL itself has been on the proverbial rocks for a while. After Sprint purchased a third of rapper Jay-Z\u2019s music streaming platform for $200 million last year, they were accused of inflating their number of users. In particular, TIDAL claimed a Kanye West album was streamed 250 million times in the first 10 days on the service \u2014 when it only had 3 million users.", "description": "The October 21st benefit concert will feature more than a dozen artists\u00a0at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.", "authors": ["Nate Church"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/AmericaFerreraTo1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
