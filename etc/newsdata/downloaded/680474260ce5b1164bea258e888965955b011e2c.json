The structure restricts mobility and strength. It\u2019s presented numerous challenges physically growing up and into adulthood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatt says he was bullied at school, but his incredible support network of family and friends helped him to stay strong.\n\n\u2018I owe a huge amount to my parents for nurturing a positive attitude within me in what would have been a challenging time for them,\u2019 he explains.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not fearful or embarrassed asking for help anymore\u2019 (Picture: Matt Elson)\n\n\u2018When I was young, they were told I wouldn\u2019t play sports, but they still wanted me to have every opportunity.\n\n\u2018Today I still encounter challenges, but I just adapt; I drive an automatic car with modifications and found a way to change nappies when I became a dad!\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had this all my life, so you find your way. I\u2019m not fearful or embarrassed asking for help anymore.\n\n\u2018I borrow the mantra of: \u201cA person can achieve anything for which they have unlimited enthusiasm.\u201d\u2019\n\nThis condition has presented various physical challenges throughout Matt\u2019s life, but, gradually Matt built his confidence.\n\nHe developed a successful career in marketing and in his late 20s he got married, started a family, and now has two children. Becoming a dad triggered a new motivation in Matt to keep fit and healthy.\n\nWhat is Hemiplegia? Hemiplegia (sometimes called hemiparesis) is a condition, caused by a brain injury, that results in a varying degree of weakness, stiffness (spasticity) and lack of control in one side of the body. The definition comes from the Greek \u2018hemi\u2019 = half. Hemiplegia is a relatively rare condition, affecting up to one child in 1,000. About 80% of cases are congenital, and 20% acquired. It\u2019s a lifelong condition, but it doesn\u2019t get worse.\n\nLooking to push his physical and mental agility, Matt attended his local gym, Anytime Fitness Clifton. And working out quickly became an integral part of his life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It has given me confidence, belief, strength \u2013 both physically and mentally,\u2019 says Matt.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m able to train my right and left side, but at different paces, through adapting the equipment at the gym. The competition aspect instils discipline, while nutrition provides a healthy foundation for my life.\n\n\u2018Hemiplegia will always be a part of me, but I am determined to adapt and find ways to navigate through hurdles and break down barriers.\u2019\n\nMatt loves the challenge of bodybuilding and sticking to a rigorous training programme. He has also been heavily inspired by other disabled athletes that he has watched competing.\n\n\u2018The togetherness and friendly competitiveness amongst our class is brilliant and I want to help grow it further,\u2019 says Matt. \u2018That is what drives me to compete. I\u2019ve done around 15 shows in three years and it gets bigger and better year after year.\n\n\u2018What I love most is the notion that everyone is in the gym to improve something, so it\u2019s an equal platform\u2019 (Picture: Matt Elson)\n\nThis is Matt\u2019s third year of competing and he has travelled all over the UK and competing international, particularly in the US, is a big personal ambition for him.\n\n\u2018We had our World Championship last year, which was amazing and in May this year I placed 1st at the European Championships in Birmingham.\n\n\u2018I also competed internationally in Ireland last month. My next competition is the British Finals in Hull.\u2019\n\nBut getting to elite level hasn\u2019t been easy for Matt. It has taken an extraordinary amount of hard work and patience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It has taken years to find a way to train that works for my body and programme; I love to gain and learn as much as I can.\n\n\u2018I use safety straps on my left side to support my motion, but one of the fun parts is testing (safely) how I can incorporate different methods.\n\n\u2018What I love most is the notion that everyone is in the gym to improve something, so it\u2019s an equal platform.\u2019\n\nMaking training sessions part of his daily routine has developed discipline and a level of confidence that Matt never had before.\n\n\u2018At the beginning of my membership, I didn\u2019t step into the free-weight areas for six months due to a lack of confidence,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018However, my early personal training sessions developed this, and I gradually started building the knowledge and patience to try new sets.\n\n\u2018Without their friendly and enthusiastic approach of the trainers and members at Anytime Fitness, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today. I have a lot to thank them for throughout my journey.\u2019\n\nMatt wants his progression to inspire others. He knows how influential seeing role models who reflect your own life experience can be.\n\n\u2018I want to help, serve and promote disability fitness, through speaking, writing and work,\u2019 says Matt.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been so inspired by friends\u2019 journeys and if I can help others on stage or getting into fitness, that makes it all worth it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m planning on competing with the PCA USA, hopefully in 2020.
