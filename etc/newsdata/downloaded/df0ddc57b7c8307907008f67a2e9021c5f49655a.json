I tried to have a shower before and I fell down. I just clean my face in the sink now.\n\n\u201cThere is lots of noise from inside and people with drugs, smoking inside their rooms, making the alarm go off, which often wakes me up. I struggle to sleep. Often I just can\u2019t sleep.\n\n\u201cNo one comes to visit me. I am so far from my community. I do nothing. I stay inside. Yesterday I tried to open the curtain and it fell down.\u201d\n\nMr Sharif said he had been told he would be moved into a flat on 12 August, and then that it would be by the end of the month. He added: \u201cNothing has changed. All these promises, they were lies. It feels like I am being punished.\u201d\n\nHis local authority, Tower Hamlets council, said his housing application was being treated as a \u201chigh priority\u201d but the property he had been offered was undergoing \u201cmajor works\u201d.\n\nHis housing solicitor, Simon Mullings of Edwards Duthie Shamash Solicitors, said the problems Mr Sharif faces were the symptoms of the \u201cwidespread and long term housing crisis\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He woke up two weeks later in hospital with severe injuries, which led to part of his skull having to be removed.\n\nWhen the 43-year-old was discharged from hospital police said he should not be housed in the borough of Hackney for his own safety.\n\nHe was referred to Tower Hamlets council, which temporarily placed him in a room in a hotel in Ilford, saying he would be given permanent accommodation within two months.\n\nMore than half a year later, he is still waiting.\n\nA council spokesperson said: \u201cMr Sharif\u2019s housing application has been treated as a high priority and he has now been made a permanent offer of accommodation.\n\n\u201cWe have been advised by Newlon Housing Association that the property has been undergoing some major works and expect a move in date to be confirmed this week. We will be chasing this matter to ensure a speedy resolution.\u201d\n\nA Newlon Housing Trust spokesperson said: \u201cUnfortunately the property Atif al-Sharif could potentially move into has been severely vandalised and requires extensive works. We will carry these out as soon as possible, but due to the level of works required this may take some time.\u201d", "description": "A disabled refugee is still living in unsuitable accommodation more than a year after he was brutally attacked in the street.
