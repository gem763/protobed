We later tried to wake her for a shower, we couldn\u2019t get her to walk, it was like carrying a dead weight. I left the room for five minutes afterwards to get her more clothes and the next thing I knew I heard screaming [from a family friend].\n\n\"Molly\u2019s eyes had rolled into the back of her head and she had stopped breathing.\u2019\"\n\nDoctors reportedly tried to save the teen for two hours before she was moved to hospital, where she later died from complications arising from mumps.\n\nNow her family is desperately trying to get her body home.\n\n(Image: GoFundMe)\n\nMolly's grieving loved ones are fundraising in an effort to get her body repatriated to the UK in an effort that has raised nearly \u00a310,000 so far.\n\nHer aunt wrote on the page: \"To bring our baby girl home it\u2019s going to cost us \u00a35,000.
