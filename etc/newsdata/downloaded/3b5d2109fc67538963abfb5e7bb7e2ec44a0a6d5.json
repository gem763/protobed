CBA\u2019s commitment and Microsoft\u2019s wealth of experience have been instrumental to achieving this historic milestone. Our goal is to continue to harness innovation for the benefit of markets and our mission of ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity\u201d. Arunma Oteh, World Bank Treasurer\n\nThe CBA, who are behind the development of the platform, said that the project was built on the Ethereum network and was supervised and evaluated by the technical team at Microsoft for architecture, security systems, and to ensure standards in line with the market and other platforms.\n\nThis will be the first time that a bond is issued, stored and managed completely in the blockchain, which will bring increased security and privacy and will shorten the times associated with transactions when compared to traditional methods.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abel Colmenares Napolitano", "Abel Is A Fintech Enthusiast Experienced With Blockchain Technology.
