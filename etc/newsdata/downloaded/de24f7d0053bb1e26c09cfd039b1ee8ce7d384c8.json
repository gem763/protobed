MPs will be asked whether or not they are happy to sign off on Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for Brexit.\n\nWe are all frustrated with the Government\u2019s chaotic approach to the Brexit negotiations and the deadlock in Parliament.\n\nHowever, when I read the small print of Boris Johnson\u2019s agreement it became clear to me that this is a fundamentally bad deal for our country.\n\nIt is worse than Theresa May\u2019s deal \u2013 and here are the five reasons why.\n\nFirst, it rules out any possibility of the UK negotiating a new customs union with the EU after we leave.\n\nThat would represent a huge blow to British manufacturing and the communities that are so dependent on those industries.\n\nSecond, Boris Johnson\u2019s deal rejects the UK having a close relationship with the Single Market. It strips out the safety net on workplace rights, consumer protections and environmental standards.\n\nEven by the Government\u2019s own estimates, the basic free trade agreement envisaged by the deal would make every region and nation in the UK poorer.\n\nThird, if this deal is passed then there is a very real risk that we would crash out on no deal terms at the end of December 2020.\n\nThat is not only my assessment, it is the viewed shared by the Tory MP John Baron who revealed to the BBC that Johnson\u2019s deal \u201cmeans we could leave on no-deal terms next year.\u201d\n\n(Image: James McCauley/REX)\n\nBaron let the cat out of the bag. Boris Johnson\u2019s plan is the blueprint for a disastrous cliff-edge Brexit in little over a year\u2019s time \u2013 and that is why it has the support of so many Tory MPs.\n\nFourth, the proposals being debated do nothing to address the serious concerns Labour has raised about security cooperation or participation in EU agencies and programmes after Brexit.\n\nIt is a simple copy and paste job on the previous Prime Minister\u2019s flawed deal.\n\nFinally, for Mirror readers wondering why Labour doesn\u2019t trust Boris Johnson, you only have to look at how he has treated his coalition partners.\n\nHe told the DUP conference last year that \u201cno British Conservative government could or should sign up to\u201d a deal that put a customs border in the Irish Sea. And yet that is precisely what the Prime Minister\u2019s deal does.\n\nJohnson\u2019s treatment of the DUP should come as no surprise. He will turn his back on anyone if it suits his own personal ambition.\n\nThe deal before Parliament is a sell out deal. It sells out our economy, manufacturing base and people\u2019s jobs.\n\nThe small print lays bare that the end destination is a damaging right-wing project, which will rip apart our relationship with the EU and replace it with a Trump-style US economy.\n\nThat is why the Labour and trade union movement cannot support this deal.", "description": "This is a fundamentally bad deal for our country and it will leave Britain poorer, writes Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer", "authors": ["Keir Starmer", "Image", "James Mccauley Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20644291.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_EU-Brexit-summit-Brussels-Belgium-17-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
