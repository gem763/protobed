That's something the ruling Communist Party in Beijing wouldn't stomach because it considers Taiwan a breakaway province and refuses to acknowledge the administration of directly elected President Tsai Ing-wen.\n\nTaiwan later changed tack.\n\nOfficials said that with Hong Kong unresponsive to requests for formal cooperation, the Taiwanese government's Mainland Affairs Council wrote a letter offering to send a team to escort Chan back, said Chiu Chui-cheung, the council's deputy director.\n\nThey hoped Hong Kong officials would receive them and hand over Chan along with any evidence and testimony collected in the case, he said.\n\n\"If Hong Kong won't handle it, we will handle it,\" Chiu said. \"We hope the Hong Kong side can coordinate with our people coming to Hong Kong to verify the identity of the suspect and bring him back.\"\n\nThere was no immediate response from Hong Kong's government.\n\nHong Kong's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, had cited Chan's case as one of the main reasons behind proposed changes to Hong Kong's extradition laws, saying it presented a \"loophole\" allowing him to avoid being sent back to face charges in Taiwan. But fears that such a law would put residents at risk of being sent to mainland China's murky judicial system sparked months of chaotic protests that mushroomed into Hong Kong's biggest political crisis in decades.\n\nLam was forced to drop the bill. It's set to be formally withdrawn in a legislative session Wednesday, according to one of Lam's top deputies, Matthew Cheung, following the continuation of increasingly violent street protests over the weekend.\n\nChan wrote to Lam last week saying he wanted to return to Taiwan and turn himself in after his sentence ends.\n\nBut Su urged Hong Kong to put Chan on trial for the February 2018 murder of girlfriend Poon Hiu-wing instead of giving him \"a window of time\" in which Chan can travel around after he is freed.\n\nCheung responded by urging Taiwan not to \"complicate a simple issue, and also do not try to exploit politics in order to really achieve a certain gain\" at the expense of justice.\n\n\"I really appeal to the Taiwanese authorities to tackle the matter with common sense, with compassion,\" Cheung said. \"We are talking about somebody who is willing to surrender himself and can get back to Taiwan to face trial.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press videojournalist Taijing Wu in Taipei, Taiwan, and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
