PG&E was fined $1.6bn for the San Bruno explosion and a federal jury found the company guilty of six felony charges, ordering it to pay $3m in fines.\n\nGerald Singleton, an attorney who represents more than 5,000 victims who lost their homes in northern California wildfires started by the utility\u2019s equipment, said the agreement was a step in the right direction because it meant that the company had reached settlements with insurance companies and public entities.\n\nHe added: \u201cNow we just have to get a fair amount for the individuals.\u201d\n\nInsurance companies that reached the settlement said it was well below the $20bn they had sought in bankruptcy court.\n\nThe deal removes some of the uncertainty hanging over PG&E as it tries to climb out of its financial pit. The company\u2019s stock rose nearly 11% Friday to close at $11.18.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s settlement is another step in doing what\u2019s right for the communities, businesses, and individuals affected by the devastating wildfires,\u201d the PG&E CEO, Bill Johnson, said in a statement.\n\nTwo major outstanding questions still linger over the bankruptcy, said Michael Wara, a senior research scholar at Stanford University and a member of the state wildfire committee: how much PG&E will pay the outstanding fire victims, and whether a jury will find the utility liable for the 2017 wine country Tubbs fire, which took 22 lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to know what the PG&E bankruptcy resolution will look like, because you don\u2019t know how much money the company has to come up with,\u201d Wara said.\n\n\u201cWe want to avoid having ratepayers get punished for this bankruptcy, but the company provides this essential service,\u201d he said. \u201cHow that gets resolved is going to be a very tricky process.\u201d\n\nThe settlement still must be approved by a bankruptcy court. PG&E on Monday released a plan to offer nearly $18bn total to wildfire victims, insurance companies and cities and public entities in California that battled wildfires sparked by its electrical equipment.\n\nThat figure will now climb to nearly $20.5bn, including $11bn for insurance companies as part of the tentative deal; $8.4bn to pay wildfire claims from uninsured victims, which attorneys representing them have rejected as too low; and $1bn to local governments affected by the wildfires.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company is under pressure to emerge from bankruptcy by June 2020 to participate in a state wildfire fund. The fund is intended to help California\u2019s major utilities pay out future claims as climate change makes wildfires across the western US more frequent and more destructive.", "description": "PG&E to pay insurers of claimants from two years of blazes, including Paradise fire that left 86 dead, in tentative deal", "authors": ["Vivian Ho"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebbab131b7c5251331dcda5a6b7fea26f27e623d/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=abb2a6501545a0e07eb29e72c351d78d", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
