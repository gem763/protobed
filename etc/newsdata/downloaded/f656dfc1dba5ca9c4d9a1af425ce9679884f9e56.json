One girl wanted to talk to him about his song Two of Us , which he had written after the death of his mother. The girl had lost her dad, and wanted the singer to know how much his lyrics had meant to her. He\u2019d never had that in his band One Direction, he says. \u201cWe wrote cool songs, but they were love songs. It only goes so far, and to have someone say that I could help them with my \u2026\u201d He pauses. \u201cIt blows my mind, that shit. I was proper proud.\u201d\n\nIt has been a hard few years. Tomlinson\u2019s mother died in 2016, just as he was about to launch his first solo single. In March this year, his 18-year-old sister was found unconscious at her flat in London and couldn\u2019t be revived. We will come to that, but, professionally, Tomlinson was struggling too. One Direction \u2013 that supernova of a boy band \u2013 broke up in 2015. Or announced they were taking a break. Or \u201c\u2018hiatus\u2019 or whatever word we use\u201d, he says with a smile.\n\nAt the time, Tomlinson, now 27, was finding his place as a songwriter. \u201cI wasn\u2019t singing a lot, I wasn\u2019t the frontman. Without being a sorry little bastard, I thought: \u2018How do I do better, how do I make something of myself, an identity?\u2019\u201d In the last 18 months of One Direction, he says, \u201cI felt like I knew who I was in the band, and I felt a real worth for who I was.\u201d The break up, he says, \u201crocked me. I wasn\u2019t ready for it. I felt like I was getting to be a better songwriter, singer, a more confident performer, and all of a sudden, when I felt I was finally getting some momentum \u2026\u201d\n\nWe meet at a bar in north London. Tomlinson greets me with a hug as if I am one of his fans (I am not, particularly, although I am by the end). He seems open but not vulnerable, and more self-aware and modest than you would expect from a man who was once part of the biggest boy band in the world. He is friendly and relaxed, dressed in a black tracksuit, with a beer in front of him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch the video for Kill My Mind\n\nTomlinson\u2019s personal tragedies also meant his solo career has had a bit of a stop-start quality, but now it looks as if there is focus and momentum. He released his single Kill My Mind earlier this month; an album will follow next year. Kill My Mind is an indie-pop delight, not so huge a departure as to alienate his fanbase, but it sounds like the music he grew up listening to \u2013 Oasis and Arctic Monkeys \u2013 and his South Yorkshire accent brings more than a hint of Liam Gallagher-style northern vocals. He sounds confident on them, more so than on the previous singles he put out, a couple of fairly forgettable collaborations. \u201cI think, in hindsight, that was me trying to find my place in the industry and making music I thought I had to make to get on radio.\n\n\u201cI had this epiphany when I was thinking about the music I grew up with,\u201d he continues. \u201cI kind of had a bit of a word with myself and worked out what I want \u2013 to be happy and proud of what I\u2019m doing. I love those early singles, but I never really felt proud of them, because it didn\u2019t feel too true to me.\u201d\n\nAs a child, growing up in Doncaster with his mum Johannah, who raised him alone until she married Tomlinson\u2019s stepfather, he loved performing. \u201cI liked to be the class clown, I liked to make people laugh, to show off, all that.\u201d When his younger twin sisters were cast on TV dramas, he would sometimes go along as their chaperone, earning \u00a330. \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, we don\u2019t have anyone who\u2019s been on TV or anything like that, so it was super-exciting,\u201d he says. He ended up picking up work as an extra. \u201cThe pinnacle of my acting career was one line on an ITV drama. I don\u2019t even know if they used my scene,\u201d he says with a laugh.\n\nWhen he was 15, he joined a drama group in Barnsley, which his mum would take him to when she could afford it. \u201cI think I was confused, thinking I wanted to act when actually what I wanted to do was perform.\u201d\n\nAt school he joined a band, where they sang Oasis and Green Day covers, and when The X Factor came up, he made it on to the show in 2010 on his third attempt. He queued from 3am to make sure the producers wouldn\u2019t have audition fatigue before they saw him, and he got his goal \u2013 to get in front of Simon Cowell \u201cand just have a professional opinion on how I am as a singer. I was so flustered. Going from school performances to performing in front of professionals, TV cameras, a 3,000-strong audience. I wasn\u2019t present. I sang terribly. I remember coming away from it thinking: \u2018I wonder if I\u2019ve got through as one of those lads who looks all right but isn\u2019t really a good singer.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One Direction in 2012 (from left): Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne and Harry Styles.

For six years they sold tens of millions of records, broke America and each made a rumoured \u00a340m-plus fortune. Their fans, Directioners, are another level of devoted. I don\u2019t know how he coped with the attention, or the pressure.\n\nThere were really only a few times when it got too much, says Tomlinson. They were in Australia and a local news station had got a helicopter and a photographer was trying to get pictures of Tomlinson in his top-floor hotel room. \u201cI think I was naked, or just in my boxers, and even in my hotel room there was no escape. I could feel the pressure.\u201d He tweeted about it \u2013 \u201cyour standard bratty celebrity tweet\u201d \u2013 and was attacked. \u201cAt times it did stress me out but never was I allowed to whinge, allowed to be a human and say: \u2018Today has got too much for me.\u2019 I found that difficult at first.\u201d\n\nBut he is keen not to sound as if he is complaining. \u201cThere was much more positive that outweighed that.\u201d And he never blames the fans for their intensity. Theirs is a special relationship, he says. \u201cSo many people have bullshitted about what they feel about the fans, but they\u2019re like family to me.\u201d\n\nEven when Directioners have got a bit too ardent \u2013 there is a conspiracy theory, for example, that he and his bandmate Harry Styles have long been in a secret sexual relationship \u2013 he seems more bemused by it than annoyed. Although he is wary, he says, of adding \u201cfuel to the fire\u201d by talking about it. \u201cI know, culturally, it\u2019s interesting, but I\u2019m just a bit tired of it,\u201d he says. The HBO drama Euphoria recently showed an animated sequence of Tomlinson and Styles together, as imagined by a smutty fan-fiction writer. Was it annoying that a show had taken something fairly niche and given it new mainstream life? \u201cAgain, I get the cultural intention behind that. But I think \u2026\u201d He trails off, trying to work out what he wants to say. \u201cIt just felt a little bit \u2026 No, I\u2019m not going to lie, I was pissed off. It annoyed me that a big company would get behind it.\u201d\n\nWhy does he think he never went off the rails during the band\u2019s heady period? \u201cMy mates and my family, really. It\u2019s from my upbringing and where I come from. If I went back to Doncaster and I was dripping in Gucci or whatever, I\u2019d probably get whacked. I\u2019m always very conscious of not acting too big for my boots. It\u2019s the people around me who keep me sane and normal, because they give me insight into real life.\u201d He lives with his girlfriend, Eleanor and his best friend, Oli. \u201cSome celebrities, in pop in particular, only surround themselves with amazingness, and all they see is good, good, good, which is lovely, but you don\u2019t understand the real world then. I have the luxury of my mates around me, just reminding me how fucking good I\u2019ve got it, really.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With his mother, Johannah, in 2015. Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images\n\nThe day of One Direction\u2019s final concert in November 2015, Tomlinson and his bandmate Niall Horan sat together \u201cand had a little cry, because it was such a journey we had been on. That day in general was so poignant. As much as you try and prepare yourself, it\u2019s a whole other thing when it comes.\u201d Because they had worked so much with few days off, he assumed that a break would be exciting. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t like that. When you\u2019re used to working however many days, it\u2019s all that more evident when you\u2019re not doing something. Especially in the first six months.\u201d He spent time in Los Angeles with his son, who was born in 2016, after his relationship with a stylist, Briana Jungwirth. \u201cMy life became \u2013and I don\u2019t mean this to sound derogatory \u2013 very normal, from being a life of pure craziness.\u201d\n\nAt the same time that Tomlinson was trying to work out what to do with himself, his mother, to whom he was intensely close, had been diagnosed with leukaemia; she died in December 2016. He performed his first single on The X Factor just a few days after her death, then seemed to half-heartedly continue with his solo career, releasing another single in 2017. It would be another two years \u2013 during which he became a judge on The X Factor \u2013 before he released Two of Us, a raw and beautiful (and under-rated) song.\n\n\u201cAfter I lost my mum, every song I wrote felt, not pathetic, but that it lacked true meaning to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt that, as a songwriter, I wasn\u2019t going to move on until I\u2019d written a song like that.\u201d He knew he needed to get it out of him, but there was a lot of pressure \u2013 he felt he should be an experienced songwriter before he attempted it. Two songwriters he worked with played him the chorus. \u201cIt was like the song I always wished I\u2019d written. I went in and put my personal touch to the verses. It was a real moment for me in my grief, and as part of the creative process, because it felt like it was hanging over me.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch the video for Two of Us\n\nEarlier this month, an inquest found that his sister F\u00e9licit\u00e9 had died of an accidental overdose; she had been taking drugs, including anxiety medication, since the death of their mother. He has been through some terrible times, I say, which must put a perspective on a pop career. \u201cExactly,\u201d he says, a little quieter than before. \u201cThat whole dark side I\u2019ve gone through, it sounds stupid to say, but it gives me strength everywhere else in my life, because that\u2019s the darkest shit that I\u2019m going to have to deal with. So it makes everything else, not feel easier and not less important, but, in the grand scheme of things, you see things for what they are, I suppose.\u201d\n\nHis fans have been crucial, he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure every artist says this, but I do believe it. We\u2019ve been through some dark times together and those things I\u2019ve been through, they carry a weight, emotionally, on the fans as well. And I felt their love and support. I remember really clearly when I lost my mum, that support was mad.\u201d\n\nWhat have the experiences of loss he has been through taught him about himself? He thinks for a second. \u201cI keep going back to it, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a combination of where I grew up and my mum\u2019s influence, but I just have this luxury of being able to see the glass half-full no matter what.\u201d He is the oldest of his mother\u2019s seven children, which is grounding and means, he says, \u201cthere\u2019s no time for me to be sat feeling sorry for myself. I\u2019ve been to rock bottom and I feel like, whatever my career\u2019s going to throw in front of me, it\u2019s going to be nothing as big or as emotionally heavy as that. So, weirdly, I\u2019ve turned something that\u2019s really dark into something that empowers me, makes me stronger.\u201d\n\nHe gets up to go to the toilet, which I think is his polite way of asking me to move on, although when he gets back he says, by way of a final word on the matter, \u201cI don\u2019t want people to feel sorry for me. That\u2019s not how I feel for myself. Somehow it fuels me.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest 1D face the fans: the band\u2019s last performance was in 2015. Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar\n\nOne Direction will get back together one day, he believes. He still speaks to the others. \u201cWe\u2019re not texting each other every day, but what we do have, which will never go away, is this real brothership. We\u2019ve had these experiences that no one else can relate to.\u201d\n\nStyles has become quite the superstar. The others seem to have steady solo careers. Tomlinson says he\u2019s embarrassed to admit that, when he first went solo, he would have been devastated had his album \u201conly\u201d reached No 3, so used is he to everything he did with One Direction going to the top. Is it hard not to measure himself against his former bandmates? \u201cOh, naturally,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve never been competitive like that, but, naturally, you think: \u2018If they\u2019re getting this then I deserve that.\u2019 I think, the longer time goes on, I can see it for what it is and just be proud of them.\u201d And success means something else to him now. \u201cIt means I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nKill My Mind, by Louis Tomlinson, is out now on Arista.
