The murals on the wall helped bring back memories of the era,\" she said.\n\n\"I should like the wall to retain at least one of the (original) murals\" she said. \"If they must be changed, leave at least one to commemorate the events of that time\".\n\nShe also wishes to see more vivid colours, to inspire children with \"a positive energy\".\n\nAmir Hossein, a shopworker in his twenties, was sceptical about the make-over.\n\n\"What do they want to prove with these paintings?\" What are they trying to prove by removing or changing them?\" he asked\n\nMohammad, a young delivery man, believes \"there should only be paintings of peace and friendship\".\n\n\"Peace and friendship with the American people, not with their government,\" he added.\n\n\"Our government has problems with their government, but we have no problem with the American people.\"", "description": "Famous murals celebrating Iran's Islamic revolution daubed on walls of the former US embassy in Tehran have been erased to make way for new paintings to be unveiled on the fortieth anniversary of the hostage crisis.
