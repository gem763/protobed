The most special memory I have is of us chatting over food in a cafe. It may not seem exciting, but to me, it\u2019s comforting and meaningful. I love that we can talk about our family and worry about our future together, knowing that we\u2019ll always be there to support each other. She lets me rant on about my problems and gives me good advice; she\u2019s like a big sister to me.\n\nKai U Cheang, 17, Macau Anglican College\n\nMy best friend is Amy. We\u2019ve been best friends for five years now. We\u2019ve never fought because we are always respectful of each other\u2019s opinions and decisions. We both love books and like talking about what we\u2019re currently reading. Last summer, we went to Shanghai together. We visited the Pearl Tower, where we enjoyed the view and had fun taking pictures. She\u2019s the first friend I\u2019ve ever travelled with.\n\nHuang Ka-yi, 12, Po Leung Kuk Ma Kam Ming College\n\nBest Friends Forever #1\n\nSleep and I are inseparable. We used to hang out for hours everyday when I was young. These days I haven\u2019t been able to see it as much. I\u2019ve just been so busy with school work, so we can only catch up for a few hours. But it\u2019s those precious moments when we\u2019re together that keeps me going in life.\n\nNicholas Ng, 17, South Island School\n\nEveryone has a BFF. My best friend is someone very special to me \u2013 my father. We\u2019re both into playing basketball, so we have always have a lot to talk about. He is kind, friendly, and strict when he needs to be. He\u2019s my friend as well as my teammate and teacher. When I was little, my dad taught me how to play basketball patiently and never gave up on me. I appreciate him very much, and think he will be my best friend forever.\n\nFeng Yu-ho, 14, Po Leung Kuk Ma Kam Ming College\n\nBest Friends Forever #2: Always by my side\n\nI have a guitar, and it is my best friend. He\u2019s not warm and cuddly like a pet animal, but when I hear its voice, I feel warm inside. He isn\u2019t the kind of friend who can listen to your worries, either, but when it speaks, I feel calmer. I got my guitar from my father and it was the best birthday present I ever received. We\u2019ve stayed up together on many nights writing songs, and I\u2019ve been through many ups and downs with it.\n\nCynthia So, 17, Creative Secondary School\n\nEdited by Nicole Moraleda", "description": "Best friends come in all shapes and sizes, but what matters most are the memories we share with them", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/d85a85ca-e0f1-11e9-94c8-f27aa1da2f45imagehires131237.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
