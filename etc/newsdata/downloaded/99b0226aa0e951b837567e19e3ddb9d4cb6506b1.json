It will now head to Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk for signing or a veto, and it would take effect on Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nThe legislation prohibits officers from running facial recognition in real time or after the fact on footage collected by body cameras. However, police still may use the technology to blur faces in videos disclosed to the public, in order to protect individuals\u2019 privacy. Police groups opposed the bill while others, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, backed it.\n\nAssemblymember Phil Ting, the bill\u2019s sponsor, said Thursday\u2019s vote was important for maintaining trust in communities that have benefited from the transparency cameras provide.\n\n\u201cIf you install software onto those body cameras, then you run the risk of really destroying that trust,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt becomes a tool of surveillance, which was never the goal.\u201d\n\nThe bill reflects growing discontent in the United States over facial recognition, which government agencies have used for years and now has become more powerful with the rise of cloud computing and artificial intelligence technologies. San Francisco and Oakland voted this year to ban city personnel from using it.\n\nCritics have said facial recognition is not ready for prime time, pointing to technology from Amazon.com Inc and others that struggled to identify the gender of individuals with darker skin in recent studies. This has prompted fears of unjust arrests.\n\nAmazon has defended its work and said all users must follow the law.\n\nCalifornia is poised to follow states including Oregon that have prohibited facial recognition for officer-worn cameras, which Ting\u2019s bill likens to \u201crequiring every person to show a personal photo identification card at all times.\u201d This \u201cmay chill the exercise of free speech in public places,\u201d the bill says.\n\nA revision this month shortened the proposed law\u2019s duration to three years from seven, addressing concerns that the technology might greatly improve. The California Police Chiefs Association said on Twitter on Tuesday that the technology is only used to narrow lists of suspects in investigations, not to automate decisions on whom to arrest.", "description": "California's legislature on Thursday passed a three-year ban on state and local law enforcement from using body cameras with facial recognition software, the latest curb on technology that some say poses a threat to civil liberties.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Dastin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429243261&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B27I", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
