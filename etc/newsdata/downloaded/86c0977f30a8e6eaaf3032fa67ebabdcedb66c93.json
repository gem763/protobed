More than 3,000 residents are ineligible to vote due to their status as refugees, the resolution said.\n\nOne resident spoke out against the measure, accusing the council of \"political pandering\" to voters.\n\n\"We have 40,000-plus registered voters,\" the unidentified resident said. \"How many of those are nonresident college students who vote on our property taxes, our legislators, our city leadership -- which includes all of you -- and much more, and then move away?\"\n\nBurlington, the hometown of Democratic socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, has a population of approximately 42,000 people. It is also home to the University of Vermont, which has more than 10,000 undergraduate students.\n\nCouncil President Kurt Wright said he voted against the legislation because he believes only American citizens should be able to vote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s important. I would not expect to move to another country and not become a citizen and expect to be voting in their elections,\u201d said Wright, a Republican. \u201cWe voted on this just a few years ago and the citizens of Burlington voted significantly against it so I\u2019m not supportive of this proposal.\u201d\n\nThe measure still needs approval from the state Legislature before it becomes law.", "description": "Lawmakers in Burlington, Vt.,\u00a0approved a resolution Monday that would allow\u00a0non-citizens to vote in city elections.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/d25c805b-Capture.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
