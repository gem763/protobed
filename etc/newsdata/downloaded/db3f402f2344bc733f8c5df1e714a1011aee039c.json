He admitted it was an act of foul play, but argued it did not warrant a red card.\n\nHowever, the committee decided that \"the dynamics of the tackle were affected by the actions of both players\" and banned Quaglio for three games.\n\nQuaglio was on the pitch as a replacement for Marco Ricconi, who himself came off the bench for prop Simone Ferrari. The dearth of specialist front-row forwards resulted in uncontested scrums for most of the match.\n\nO'Shea faces a selection crisis for Saturday's must-win clash with New Zealand.\n\n\"We've a good few injuries, a good few knocks and bruises from today, especially at tight-head. We'll see what the best 23 we can get fit and on the pitch for next week,\" admitted the Irishman after the South Africa match.", "description": "Two Italian props received three-match bans for a joint tip-tackle on South African Duane Vermeulen that now leaves coach Conor O'Shea with a front-row headache.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7884/fffd82637dd54421a98bef9c8d8f0d50.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
