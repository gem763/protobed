Yet these developments are not trivial. They form part of China\u2019s efforts to erase Uighur culture. Recent research details official efforts to change Uighur women\u2019s style, which began with 2011\u2019s \u201cProject Beauty\u201d initiative, encouraging them to shun the niqab and jilbab, and has recently has seen the establishment of hair salons and beauty parlours. These, explained an official, would transform women\u2019s body image, then their way of life, and finally their way of thinking.\n\nMeanwhile, satellite photos have revealed that dozens of cemeteries in the north-western region have been destroyed in the last two years. In Aksu, at the graveyard where a prominent Uighur poet was buried, tombs were moved and the land turned into Happiness Park, with panda models and a children\u2019s ride. Similar evidence has already shown the demolition of Islamic religious sites. Like the attempts to coerce Uighurs into celebrating Chinese new year and to discourage the use of the Uighur language, these developments represent the hollowing out of a culture. Writers, entertainers and academics have all fallen foul of authorities. The family of Tashpolat Tiyip, president of Xinjiang University until his disappearance in 2017, believe he has been convicted of separatism and sentenced to death. The crackdown on Muslim cultural practices is also spreading to Hui Muslims in Ningxia. Beijing portrays its camps as \u201cvocational centres\u201d and part of a necessary campaign to root out extremism following violent attacks. But far from being a targeted response to terrorism, China\u2019s draconian detentions, surveillance and broader repression amount to treating an entire population and its way of life as a potential threat.\n\nThe US has now put 28 Chinese public security bureaus and companies on a trade blacklist over the treatment of Uighurs and other Muslims, saying they have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses. It has also imposed visa restrictions. Given Donald Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim rhetoric and actions, and his disdain for human rights, there is inevitable cynicism about the causes of this shift. It should be welcomed nonetheless, particularly given the willingness of other countries to acquiesce to what is happening in Xinjiang. Muslim-majority nations, with an eye on Chinese investments, have a particularly shameful record. Others \u2013 including Britain, Germany and Japan \u2013 have become more vocal, but remain reluctant to press the issue. Much more must be done.", "description": "Editorial: Repression in the north-western region takes many forms.
