Two hours before kick-off, with the stadium deserted, he stood in the centre circle and surveyed the scene.\n\nA few yards away, the rest of England\u2019s squad were chatting and killing time, but Mings had his earphones in and wanted to gather his thoughts before the biggest night of his professional career, no doubt reflecting on a journey that had started in the humble surroundings of Yate Town.\n\nHere he was, the 1,244th man to win a senior cap. Mings has enjoyed an assured start to the campaign with Aston Villa \u2014 Gareth Southgate and Steve Holland have followed him closely \u2014 and the wonderful spin-off arrived here in Sofia.\n\nTyrone Mings' England debut was overshadowed by racist abuse from Bulgaria supporters\n\nOn the 22nd minute, the Aston Villa defender had told an official he had heard abuse\n\nThis, clearly, was going to be a night he would never forget. The more he touched the ball, the more his confidence soared. Sharp passes to Jordan Henderson and Ross Barkley, composure to take possession from goalkeeper Jordan Pickford close to his own byline, you could see he was enjoying every second. And then...\n\nYou know what happened next. It became a night Mings would never forget for all the wrong reasons. In the 22nd minute, he shouted to Bojan Zobenica, the Croatian assistant referee on the far side of the pitch, four little words that altered the course of the night: \u2018Did you hear that?\u2019\n\nWe all heard it. Monkey chants, the despicable soundtrack that accompanies international football matches in Eastern Europe. Every time Mings or Marcus Rashford or Raheem Sterling received the ball, it was there. It had been there, in fact, from the moment they started to warm up.\n\n\u2018I am proud of how we dealt with it and took the appropriate steps,\u2019 said Mings. \u2018I could hear it as clear as day. It doesn\u2019t affect me too much. I feel more sorry for those people who feel they have to have those opinions.\n\n\u2018I am very proud of everyone for the decisions we made. I went to Harry Kane first. He spoke to the manager, who then spoke to the fourth official. Everyone was aware of it but we ultimately let our football do the talking and didn\u2019t get distracted by anything.\n\n\u2018We stood together and we made certain decisions. We were here to play football, so we didn\u2019t want to be having these conversations. But it was important we made a collective decision. We represent a lot of people and we have to not just make a stance for ourselves.\u2019\n\nThe Bulgarians had taken umbrage in their pre-match press conference about racism being a persistent line of questioning. Krasimir Balakov, the head coach, even claimed England\u2019s problems with race are far worse than in Bulgaria.\n\nThere are issues in this country, ones we cannot ignore and must address. Nobody, however, was naive enough to think this game was going to pass without incident and for the second time in seven months, an England match has been horribly overshadowed.\n\nEngland regrouped at half time and decided to come out and play the second half of the game\n\nMings, to his total credit, was a consummate professional. If the rage he felt when hearing those chants was burning, it never let it boil over.\n\nHarry Maguire is Southgate\u2019s go-to central defender, one of five men alongside Jordan Pickford, Kane, Henderson and Sterling who are guaranteed to start, fitness permitting, when Euro 2020 begins for England at Wembley on June 14.\n\nYet Mings took charge of situations, pointing to Maguire where he should go and demanding that his team-mates keep their focus. Such professionalism enabled England to swat their hapless opponents in ruthless and brutal style.\n\nThe UEFA racism protocol was followed and reached stage two of three during the first half\n\n\u2018It did not affect my feelings one bit,\u2019 he said. \u2018I did not feel it was a personal attack. I felt a bit sorry for the people that have these views. I feel it is not a reflection of the views of the whole country. I have a duty to people who don\u2019t have a voice or who perhaps are abused and it does hurt them.\u2019\n\nIt will be interesting to see what happens next month if Southgate has a full complement of central defenders available. One thing we can say for certain, though, is that Mings absolutely deserves another opportunity to play for England.\n\nReaching the pinnacle should provide memories that last a lifetime. Speak to any of the members of this group about how they felt the first time they had Three Lions on their chest and, instantly, you will see a beaming smile. Playing for England is what every little English boy who kicks a football wants to do.\n\nDespite this, Mings remained composed and didn't allow his rage to boil over in the defence\n\nThe first night should be special. Mings, miserably, saw bigots steal the headlines. That cannot be right. Reassuringly, Southgate will know that. When he does his debrief and focuses on the football, he will see Mings\u2019 big audition went smoothly.\n\n\u2018I am immensely proud,\u2019 said Mings, who arranged for his family to fly here on Monday morning so they could be here to watch. \u2018It is a dream come true, for sure. Everybody knows my journey. This will be a memory we will talk about for a long, long time. We won\u2019t talk about the negatives.\u2019\n\nHe headed for the team bus with a smile on his face, handling the situation like a veteran with 50 caps. Mings, be clear, has earned the chance to go again.", "description": "DOMINIC KING FROM \nSTADION VASIL LEVSKI: Mings took charge of situations, pointing to Maguire where he should go throughout the game.", "authors": ["Dominic King For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/22/19709714-0-image-a-26_1571086811130.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
