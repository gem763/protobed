Ridiculous.\"\n\nLast December, World Rugby advised both players and supporters to cover up tattoos and respect Japanese etiquette during the tournament.\n\nAfter the exchange, which was conducted in a light-hearted spirit but did seem to confuse the Japanese journalists present and in particular England's beleaguered translator, Marler turned his attention to Saturday's match against Argentina.\n\nThe match could come down to whichever team wins at scrum time and Marler might come up against Pumas prop Enrique Pieretto.\n\nWhen the two teams met in a fiery 2016 encounter, Pieretto was sent off for stamping on Marler's head. The Englishman received a yellow card for his part in that incident.\n\n\"I wouldn't say they are niggly. They are just an extremely passionate nation and I guess so are we. So it just gets a bit heated like that,\" said Marler.\n\n\"He did stamp on my head because I held onto his leg so it was my own fault.\"\n\n\"But you can't stamp on people anymore and that was the right call. It was also the right call for me to get yellowed,\" Marler added before returning to his favourite theme of the day.\n\n\"You really had the chance to ask a proper question, you were the last one and you wasted it with that. You need to stop wearing shorts in the onsen,\" he said.\n\nReuters", "description": "During a bizarre news conference in Tokyo on Monday, England rugby prop Joe Marler took it upon himself to make sure the visiting journalists were familiar with Japan's bathing etiquette.
