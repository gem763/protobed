Our relationship started great, but somehow over the years she became very insecure. She has accused me of not loving her and we\u2019ve fought a lot. She always questions me about what I\u2019m doing and thinks I\u2019m seeing other girls. I\u2019ve talked to her about this but she doesn\u2019t want to accept my word. She simply doesn\u2019t trust me. I do love her and I\u2019ve never done anything wrong \u2013 until now. I recently cheated on her but I feel like she\u2019s pushed me into doing this. I\u2019d like to work things out with her but I don\u2019t know how.\n\nAnswer\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t blame your girlfriend for your actions. Regardless of how much she\u2019s been saying you\u2019re doing it, it was your choice ultimately to cheat on her. Unfortunately your girlfriend might just be carrying baggage from a previous relationship and that\u2019s why she\u2019s acting this way. Although she had no reason to doubt you, maybe she had a nasty experience in the past and so no matter how much you say you love her, she probably won\u2019t believe you. However, you should still tell her about your actions and make her see you acknowledge that you\u2019ve now hurt her and you\u2019re very sorry about what you\u2019ve done. You should sit down and talk to her like an adult. Express your feelings and make sure you both understand each other and are on the same page. And since you\u2019ve now done exactly what she\u2019s been accusing of, you will need to work extra hard to regain her trust. Your relationship can still work if you use your actions to show her how much you love her, but keep in mind that not everything works out and life still goes on.", "description": "Sis Dolly answers some burning questions from our readers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9439/cf6018e2d55c4a9abfd45a67c0214d08.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
