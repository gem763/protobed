The CPWNs place restrictions on named individuals.\n\nPolice also handed a number of Notices Seeking Possession (NOSPs). The parents were warned they face eviction if the children breach the terms of the notice.\n\nNeighbourhood Sergeant Ashley Palmer, of Northumbria Police, said: 'We have had\n\na number of complaints from people on the D Roads about the behaviour of a number of children.\n\nOfficers visited a total of 13 addresses linked to those suspected of bad behaviour\n\n'We have had complaints about children as young as nine who have been involved\n\nin causing criminal damage on the estates and that is unacceptable.\n\n'The behaviour has led to significant littering and damage to council property that has left the area looking like an eye sore.\n\n'That can attract anti-social behaviour itself and can be devastating for those decent people who take real pride in their home and community.\n\n'For a number of weeks we have worked with partners, and the local community, to try and come up with a solution that improves people's lives.\n\n'But a number of those warnings have been ignored and a number of these families are in the last chance saloon.\n\nNewcastle City Council said they are also involved in the new scheme\n\nAs well as anti-social behaviour, locals have complained the youths are responsible for littering\n\n'If these children don't start to change their ways then we will be left with no option but to move them out of the area to prevent further disorder from taking place.\n\n'This activity is just the start of our enforcement and I would encourage anyone who witnesses anti-social behaviour to contact police.'\n\nCllr Clare Penny-Evans, Newcastle City Council cabinet member for Communities and Climate Change, and chair of the Safe Newcastle board, said yesterday: 'The activity carried out this morning shows that we will not abandon those residents whose lives are blighted by the inconsiderate, frightening and often dangerous anti-social behaviour of a small number of people in the community.\n\n'We will take action when necessary and if the trend of this kind of behaviour continues to escalate as it has in recent months we will not hold back from removing those who are causing the problem.\n\n'We appreciate people are badly let down in terms of youth services thanks to\n\nyears of austerity inflicted upon by successive governments, but there is\n\nstill a responsibility to be mindful of our neighbours and communities.\n\n'As a council we are committed to providing decent neighbourhoods for residents of Newcastle and we will continue to work with our partners to achieve this.'", "description": "Residents in West Denton, Newcastle have complained they have been tormented by gangs of youths, some of whom are as young as nine during bouts of anti-social behaviour.", "authors": ["Darren Boyle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19546194-0-image-a-41_1570721165409.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
