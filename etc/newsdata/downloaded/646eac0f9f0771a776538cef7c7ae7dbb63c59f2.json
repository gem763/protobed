Hudson retained the waiting period that requires most women to make two trips \u2014 one for an ultrasound and another for the abortion.\n\n\u201cThe court recognizes that the waiting period following the ultrasound adds a logistical complexity to an existing myriad of hardships faced by those with limited resources and support networks,\u201d Hudson wrote. But he was not persuaded that the law \u201camounts to a substantial obstacle preventing women\u2019s access to abortion in Virginia.\u201d\n\n[Court case seeking to overturn abortion restrictions opens in Virginia]\n\nHudson\u2019s mixed ruling struck down two regulations: one that required clinics providing early-stage abortions to meet the same facility requirements as surgical hospitals and another limiting all second-trimester abortions to licensed outpatient hospitals.\n\nWith only two facilities in Virginia \u2014 in Virginia Beach and Richmond \u2014 that regularly perform second-trimester abortion procedures, the judge found a \u201csignificant burden on women seeking abortion care.\u201d That \u201ccauses anxiety, delays, and at times, the inability to undergo an abortion at all,\u201d wrote Hudson, who was appointed by President George W. Bush.\n\nAmy Hagstrom Miller, president of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, a health-care firm with clinics in three states, called the overall decision a disappointment.\n\n\u201cThe court did not see clearly how the other restrictions it left in force are not supported by medical evidence and place undue burdens on families,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cTwo-trip mandatory delay laws, inaccurate medical information, forced ultrasounds and physician-only laws harm patients and they have a disproportionate effect on people of color, rural communities, young people, and those who struggle financially.\u201d\n\nJenny Ma, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said Tuesday that the groups are considering an appeal.\n\nVictoria Cobb, president of the antiabortion Family Foundation, praised the ruling as \u201ca near-total repudiation of the abortion industry\u2019s baseless claims\u201d and a victory for \u201ccommon-sense measures to protect women\u2019s health, safety, and ensure their fully informed consent before making an irreversible decision to end the life of their unborn child.\u201d\n\n[Judge rescinds his own order allowing non-doctors to perform most abortions in Va.]\n\nThe state Department of Health and the office of Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D) defended the rules in court, putting the attorney general \u2014 an abortion rights supporter \u2014 in an awkward position. His office hired a private firm to argue the case, saying it did not have enough staff to handle it.\n\nThe office of Gov. Ralph Northam (D) was still reviewing the decision Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe governor has made it clear he believes personal medical decisions should be left to a woman and her doctor \u2014 not legislators,\u201d said Northam spokeswoman Alena Yarmosky. \u201cOur administration will continue to work to ensure women have access to the health care they need.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, who narrowly control the General Assembly, had hoped to make abortion a major issue in an election year when all 140 seats are on the Nov. 5 ballot and the balance of power is at stake. Earlier this year, Republicans made regular reference to a late-term abortion bill that Del. Kathy Tran (D-Fairfax) presented during the session in January.\n\nThe governor then made clumsy remarks defending the bill that opponents used to claim that he supported infanticide, which he did not.\n\nMoves in Alabama, Georgia and other states to pass sharp limits on abortions raised fears that Republicans would also pursue broader abortion limits in Virginia, and spurred Democrats and abortion rights activists to mobilize. That seemed to counter the earlier energy on the other side of the issue.\n\nThe Supreme Court is also considering whether to review a similar Indiana law that requires women to wait at least 18 hours after having an ultrasound to obtain an abortion. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit said Supreme Court precedent required striking down the law because it \u201cconstitutes an undue burden on those seeking an abortion without any known benefits to balance it.\u201d\n\nThe Virginia lawsuit was brought by a coalition of abortion rights groups, including the Center for Reproductive Rights, the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood and several abortion clinics across the state.\n\nExpert witnesses for the groups testified at trial that abortion is a relatively safe procedure for women, carrying less risk than a colonoscopy, plastic surgery or tonsillectomy. Between 2009 and 2016, the groups said, the number of medical facilities providing abortion care in Virginia declined by more than half. For second-trimester abortions, Virginia women must travel an average one-way distance of 41 miles, according to expert testimony.\n\nOn the other side, a former member of the board of health who testified for the state said facility regulations improve safety and services for women. Because of potential complications, there are benefits to having physicians perform abortions, Mary Catherine Slusher said.\n\nOf the physician-only law, Hudson acknowledged in his ruling that other health-care professionals, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants, are capable of providing medication for early-stage abortions and safely performing certain procedures in the first trimester.\n\nRequiring a physician may be \u201cinconvenient\u201d for people living in rural areas, the judge wrote, but he said, \u201cthis court is not convinced that it imposes an undue burden.\u201d He cited testimony from abortion providers who said most women can be seen within a week and the procedure completed within two weeks.\n\n\u201cWhether it is wise public policy,\u201d he added, \u201cis an issue for the Virginia General Assembly to address.\u201d\n\nGregory S.
