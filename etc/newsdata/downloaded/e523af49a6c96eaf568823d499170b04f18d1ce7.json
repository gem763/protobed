The image was first reported by Time. Global News Canada later uncovered another photo and video of the prime minister in blackface.\n\nAndrew Scheer, Trudeau's top challenger, immediately brought up Trudeau's blackface controversy and, throughout the two-hour debate, took every opportunity to attack his opponent.\n\n\"Mr. Trudeau, you're a phony and you're a fraud and you do not deserve to govern this country,\" Scheer said.\n\nRead more: Video shows Justin Trudeau wearing blackface, the 3rd similar image published in less than 24 hours\n\nTrudeau has also said he wore blackface during a high school performance, adding that he wasn't sure how many times in total he has darkened his face.\n\n\"He can't even remember how many times he put blackface on, because the fact of the matter is he's always wearing a mask,\" Scheer said in the debate.\n\nThe discovery of the blackface photos sparked global outrage but, according to the Associated Press, hasn't caused a drop in the polls for the prime minister.\n\nMonday's debate featured six party leaders on stage at the National History Museum in Gatineau, Quebec. It's the only debate held in English, which is the language spoken by two-thirds of Canada's population of 38 million people, according to Reuters. The debate is critical for securing votes \u2014 especially as Trudeau's Liberal Party and Scheer's Conservatives are neck-and-neck in the national polls.\n\nIn addition to the blackface scandal, Scheer also criticized Trudeau for the watchdog ruling released in August that found the prime minister's government violated Canada's ethics laws by pressuring a former justice minister to inappropriately help a construction company avoid a corruption trial.\n\nTrudeau spent time on stage accusing Scheer of hiding his campaign platform, which has yet to be released, and giving tax breaks to the rich.", "description": "Canada's Conservative party leader Andrew Scheer slammed Justin Trudeau for wearing blackface during critical debates ahead of this month's election.", "authors": ["Nicole Einbinder"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9ca2c0695b586cb232e312?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
