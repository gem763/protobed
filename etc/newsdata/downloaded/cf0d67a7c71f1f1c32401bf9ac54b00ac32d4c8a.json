North Korea is also known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).\n\nShe said the U.S. delegation had previewed a number of new initiatives that would pave the way for progress in the talks, and underscored the importance of more intensive engagement.\n\n\"The United States and the DPRK will not overcome a legacy of 70 years of war and hostility on the Korean peninsula through the course of a single Saturday,\" she added.\n\n\"These are weighty issues, and they require a strong commitment by both countries. The United States has that commitment.\"\n\nNorth Korea's Kim downplayed the U.S. gestures.\n\n\"The U.S. raised expectations by offering suggestions like a flexible approach, new method and creative solutions, but they have disappointed us greatly and dampened our enthusiasm for negotiation by bringing nothing to the negotiation table,\" he said.\n\nSwedish broadcaster TV4 said the U.S. Special Representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, who led the team, had arrived back at the U.S. embassy in central Stockholm.\n\nThe Swedish foreign office declined to give details on the invitation for new talks, or whether Pyongyang had accepted.\n\nSince June, U.S. officials had struggled to persuade North Korea, which is under sanctions banning much of its trade, due to its nuclear programme, to return to the table, but that appeared to change this week when the North abruptly announced it had agreed to talks.\n\nOn Saturday, negotiator Kim accused the United States of having no intention of solving difficulties through dialogue, but said a complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula was still possible.\n\nIt would only happen \"when all the obstacles that threaten our safety and check our development are removed completely without a shadow of doubt,\" he said, in an apparent reference to North Korea's desire for Washington to ease economic pressure.\n\nOn Sunday, China's President Xi Jinping and the North's leader exchanged messages to reaffirm the neighbours' relationship on the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties. China is the North's only major ally.\n\nXi, who has met Kim five times in the past year, said they had \"reached a series of important consensuses, leading China-North Korea relations into a new historical era\", the official Xinhua news agency said.\n\nKim replied the two leaders would \"resolutely safeguard the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and the world,\" Xinhua reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nTENSIONS\n\nThe delegation from North Korea arrived in Sweden on Thursday. Analysts have said both countries' leaders had growing incentives to reach a deal, but it was unclear if common ground could be found after months of tension and deadlock.\n\nThe readout from the talks did not sound very promising, said Jenny Town, a managing editor at 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea project.", "description": "Working-level nuclear talks in Sweden between officials from Pyongyang and Washington have broken off, North Korea's top negotiator said late on Saturday, dashing prospects for an end to months of stalemate.
