It was an insidious thing. All of a sudden I realised I had no control over my life. I was basically a slave. Anytime I had an opinion that was different to him, he got angry. if I left a toy out, he went into a rage. I would be back terrified hiding in the flat with the child because he would be on the rampage and skulking around and ready to blow.\n\n\u201cMy money wasn\u2019t my own. My thoughts weren\u2019t my own. I had to check in with him on everything. He was living off me but if I went out and bought a lipstick I was a really bad person. He borrowed thousands of pounds that I never got back. He is very angry with the world. The world is against him. It\u2019s all a conspiracy. Women are out to get him. We are all b*****s. We are all trying to trick the courts.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I didn\u2019t know he was taking drugs until very far into the relationship. He would leave lighters strewn around the room and weed out. With a toddler that is unacceptable. He would leave doors and windows open.\u201d\n\nShe said her ex would send emails every few days threatening to get the authorities to take her child away after she left him. He was initially only allowed supervised contact with their child due to his drug use but is now allowed to have unsupervised contact.\n\n\u201cWhen he was in the home, he didn\u2019t bother with our child but as soon we broke up, access was the most important thing in his life,\u201d Angela recalled. \u201cHe would turn up late to contact with our child. He wouldn\u2019t change his nappy. Later, when he was older, he would let him wet himself. He had to do a handover with staff at contact centres when the visits were supervised and he would get aggressive with them.\u201d\n\nShe said they have a contact book where they write notes to each other about practical issues but he has used this to write abusive messages to her.\n\nBecky*, another woman who was subjected to coercive control by her ex-partner, said he now has custody of their young child and has used childcare arrangements to continue the abuse.\n\nThe 47-year-old said: \u201cAfter I left him, he put her in his car and said he wanted one last bit of time with her on his own and never gave her back. I drove four hours to see her on Mother\u2019s Day for a meeting the court had scheduled, but he said \u2018You are not going to see her\u2019 and drove home. He was shouting at me and laughing. He mainly abuses me through emails \u2013 mostly he says I am crazy and a bad mum. He doesn\u2019t think that, he says it because he knows it will affect me. She cries when it\u2019s time to go back to him at the end of visits.\u201d\n\nAnne Neale, of Legal Action for Women, said: \u201cMen have been empowered by the family courts being more in their favour to pursue more cases and be more adversarial than they used to be\n\n\u201cThis creates a climate in which men feel more emboldened to harass women through the courts and continue exerting controlling behaviour through the courts. It is also linked to the wider fact that women are increasingly speaking out about abuse wherever it takes place, including through the family courts.\u201d\n\nThe campaigner, who supports women going through family courts, argued the presumption in law that it is in the best interests of the child to have contact with both parents \u201cenables\u201d the family courts to override a man\u2019s history of violence towards both the mother and children.\n\nThe warning comes after more than 120 MPs wrote to the government in May demanding an inquiry into how family courts in England and Wales deal with victims of domestic abuse.\n\nLisa Longstaff, a campaigner who is part of the Support Not Separation Coalition, said abusive ex-partners use contact as an opportunity to often verbally and sometimes physically abuse the mother.\n\nShe said: \u201cThey continue exerting coercive or controlling behaviour with the pretext of making arrangements or cause problems such as making the mother travel long distances, or not returning the child at the agreed time.\n\n\u201cViolent men also continue to exert control over ex-partners and their children through the family court, enabled by Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS), social workers and judges who routinely dismiss rape and domestic violence as either false or irrelevant to a child\u2019s welfare. This is confirmed by official figures: 70 to 90 per cent of cases in the family court involve domestic violence or abuse, yet only one per cent of contact applications from fathers are refused altogether.\n\n\u201cMothers who report rape or domestic violence are not only disbelieved and their children forced into contact with fathers they may be terrified of, they risk losing the children they are trying to protect. For spelling out the dangers the children face, mothers are accused of \u2018parental alienation\u2019 or of causing \u2018emotional harm\u2019 by \u2018poisoning\u2019 the children against the father.\u201d\n\nSandra Horley CBE, of national domestic abuse charity Refuge, argued the way family courts deal with child contact cases involving domestic abuse places women and children at risk and called for \u201curgent reform\u201d to ensure their protection is prioritised.\n\nRefuge, the largest provider of specialist domestic violence services in the UK, is calling for a reversal of the legal presumption child contact in cases of domestic abuse is always in the best interests of a child.\n\nShe added: \u201cAll too often, violent partners are using child access meetings to continue their abuse. We see cases where violent partners fail to collect or drop off children at the agreed time, causing some women to fear the perpetrator has kidnapped their children, and disrupting women\u2019s lives \u2013 causing them to miss work or cancel plans. Shockingly, we are also aware of instances where women have suffered physical and sexual assault from their abuser when children are being picked up or dropped off.\u201d\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cNo child or parent should ever be in danger because of a partner\u2019s access to their child, which is why we are reviewing the family court system to make sure they\u2019re protected.\n\n\u201cWe have also introduced legislation to ban abusers from cross-examining their victims in the family courts and throughout our review we have engaged survivors across the country to ensure we are doing everything we can to safeguard them further.\u201d\n\nChildren and Family Court Advisory and Support Service did not want to comment when approached.\n\n*The names of the women in this article have been changed to protect their identity", "description": "Thousands of domestic abusers are preying on their victims during\u00a0meetings with their children ordered by the family courts,\u00a0The Independent\u00a0can reveal.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/22/16/sad-woman-domestic-violence.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
