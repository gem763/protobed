This is a 7 percentage point increase compared to 2015.\n\nOverall, there have been decreases in discrimination in EU member state countries since 2015, the study concluded.", "description": "A new Eurobarometer study measured discrimination in Europe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/72/06/1000x563_cmsv2_6636459d-4e05-5bbe-8f52-1b0465d0f08e-4257206.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
