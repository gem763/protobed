Alicia and I have done nine movies and I write and direct and I'm usually in them very little,\u201d Schneider told Fox News of the movie. \u201cBut this one is a 'Dukes of Hazzard' tribute.\"\n\nPHOTOS: 'DUKES OF HAZZARD' CAST\n\nHe continued: \"This tastes like the 'Dukes,' it's music like the 'Dukes,' we have a balladeer, Johnny Lee, who basically took over Waylon's place. And it's fantastic. It's designed \u2013 it was written specifically for the people who say, 'Hey, is 'Dukes of Hazzard' going to do a reboot?'\n\n\u201cAnd I say, 'Probably not because they made that awful movie in 2005 and that means they don't understand the source material.' I think I do,\" Schneider added. \"So we made 'Christmas Cars.' I play a guy who was on a show 40 years ago and I drove an orange Charger with a flag on the top of it and number 1 on the door.\u201d\n\nAccording to Schneider, \u201cChristmas Cars\u201d is completely \u201cart imitating life.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cHaves and Have Nots\u201d actor plays the role of a down-on-his-luck former TV star and current shop owner who re-opens his store and begins selling die-cast replicas of the General Lee for the 40th anniversary of the series.\n\nJOHN SCHNEIDER: 'YOU CAN PURSUE YOUR DREAM IN AMERICA'\n\nSchneider\u2019s character manages to sell out of his inventory of old school, orange Dodge Chargers only for a detractor to bash the special, while the Internet claims that the vehicle and the flag painted on its roof signify racist agendas.\n\n\u201cAnd then of course, somebody gets online who wants me not to, you know \u2013 the Boss Hogg at least gets online and tries to mess that up,\u201d Schneider said of the film's plot. \u201cAnd he does that by getting online and saying, 'Boycott this man because he and his show and his car are the universal sign of intolerance and racism.\n\n\"So I went from having five thousand orders to having 4,800 people who want their money back,\" he explained. \"So it's pretty cool. So it is life imitating art or art imitating life. It's one of those things.\u201d\n\nThe Hazzard County misfit said he has a great adoration for the series and the General Lee. Schneider also said he disagrees with the idea that the flag on the car signified a symbol of racism.\n\n\u201cPeople have told me now for the last four years or five years or so, what I must think because of the car I drove on the television show and they tell me what that car meant on the television show,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cWell, who the hell are you to tell me what that car meant then or to me now?\u201d\n\nJOHN SCHNEIDER SPEAKS OUT AFTER LEAVING JAIL\n\nHe continued: \u201cIf the flag on that car when we did that show represented inequality or racism in any regard, Uncle Jesse would have made us scratch it off with our teeth. And people know that. But people are also led around by social media. We have a line in the movie where my barber \u2013 Floyd, the Barber--says, \u2018People don't think what they think anymore, they think what they're told to think.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd then you find out that the people who have social media following haven\u2019t done research either,\u201d he added.\n\nIn addition to running his own film studio, Schneider has also enjoyed a successful music career with an ever-growing catalog of music and over 20 albums to his credit.\n\nIn fact, the Christian crooner recorded a staggering 72 songs in 2018 alone and released his latest inspirational album, \"Recycling Grace,\" just last month.\n\nJOHN SCHNEIDER REVEALS HIS 'DWTS' 22 LB WEIGHT LOSS\n\n\"I started in the musical theater playing the guitar, all of that long before 'Dukes,'\" Schneider said. \"Like 10 years before 'Dukes,' I started doing theater.\"\n\nAs for his personal life, when probed about his decision to marry Allain, 51, a month before his 5-year divorce from ex-wife Elvira Castle was officially finalized, the \"Dancing With the Stars\" alum admitted that it was a \"ballsy move.\"\n\nHowever, he insisted that he had no regrets in the way he handled the matter, despite being ordered by a judge to pay Castle $25,000 a month in spousal support and fork over a portion of his Screen Actors Guild pension.\n\nCLICK HERE TO THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cYou think you're an outlaw? Well, I'll tell you what \u2013 get married a month before the divorce is final, I'll show you who the real outlaw is,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm from New York, don't tell me what to f------ do, I'll do what I want.\u201d\n\nPhysical copies of the \"Christmas Cars\" film can be purchased directly from Schneider and are slated to begin shipping the week of Nov. 25.", "description": "John Schneider\u00a0might just be the world's biggest \"Dukes of Hazzard\" fan.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/dukes-of-hazzard-660-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
