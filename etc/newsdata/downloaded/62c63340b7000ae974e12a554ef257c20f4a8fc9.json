Once the transaction is complete (subject to a shareholder vote), Canfor will become a private company under the Pattison conglomerate umbrella that includes supermarkets, fisheries and billboards.\n\nThe $16 a share deal \u2014 which was offered in August \u2014 would cost Pattison $982 million.\n\nThe special committee has given shareholders five reasons why the offer should be accepted.\n\nThese were that the offer was for 80 per cent more per share than the day before the offer was made, that it was a cash offer, that the lumber industry was in difficulty, that an independent evaluation of the share price offer was reasonable and that there were limited alternatives, given Pattison already had 51 per cent of the company.\n\n\u201cGreat Pacific and its affiliates currently own approximately 51 per cent of the Canfor Shares and, as Great Pacific has indicated that it does not intend to sell any Canfor Shares, there are limited strategic alternatives available to Canfor,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cThe special committee believes that the transaction represents fair value for shareholders and is the correct path forward for Canfor, Canfor employees, communities and shareholders. All of the directors, other than Barbara Hislop, and certain senior officers of Canfor have entered into agreements to support the transaction and vote their Canfor shares in favour of the transaction.\u201d\n\nThe deal still requires the approval of two thirds of the votes cast by the holders of Canfor shares, plus more than 50 per cent of the votes cast by non Great Pacific shareholders. Last month, an investment company (Letko Brosseau & Associates) that owns 4.8 per cent of Canfor shares told the media that it was opposed to the offer because it claimed it undervalued the company.\n\nA shareholder vote on the proposal is expected in December, 2019.\n\nCanfor is headquartered in Vancouver and has forestry operations in B.C., Alberta, the U.S. and Sweden. The company primarily deals in softwood lumber and also owns the majority of Canfor Pulp Products Inc, one of the world\u2019s largest global producers of \u201cmarket northern softwood kraft pulp.\u201d\n\ndcarrigg@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/davidcarrigg", "description": "The deal still requires the approval of two thirds of the votes cast by Canfor shareholders, plus more than 50 per cent of the votes cast by non Great Pacific shareholders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/main_-w-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
