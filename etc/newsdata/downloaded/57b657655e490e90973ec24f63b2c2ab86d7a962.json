My colleague is Kurdish and that\u2019s fine. But the PKK is something else,\u201d she added.\n\nIn a similar show of backing for the military action, at least five German regional football teams face disciplinary action after their players imitated the military salute performed by the Turkish national team during matches earlier this month.\n\nSuch gestures lead to \u201cdaily consequences for Kurds, in the streets, when they are protesting, in their work places and definitely in the schools where they are victims of discrimination by Turkish children,\u201d charged Rohat Geran of a Kurdish umbrella federation.\n\nKurds in Germany have also accused DITIB mosques in the country of pushing Ankara\u2019s views on the sidelines of prayers.\n\nBut the powerful Turkish religious organisation rejected the charges, telling AFP that it has never championed such messages.\n\nSome caught in between are just hoping that latest conflict will soon blow over.\n\n\u201cI only go back (to Turkey) once a year\u2026 we live well here. So let them sit down at the same table and find a solution, and let us live peacefully in Germany,\u201d pleaded Cezal Vedat, 43, who runs a travel agency specialising in holidays to Turkey.", "description": "Berlin (AFP) \u2013 Syrian Kurd Mohamed Zidik, 76, still buys his bread and baclavas from his Turkish neighbours in Berlin, but he knows better than to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/210871_thousands-are-streets-pro-kurdish-demonstration-in-cologne-saturday-powderkeg-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
