Soon enough the Democratic mayor from the Midwest with the tongue-tying surname, Pete Buttigieg, appears before us. He sports snug-fitting blue jeans, a white long-sleeve shirt folded neatly up to the elbows and, for me, a genial decency reminiscent of Thornton Wilder\u2019s \u201cOur Town.\u201d\n\nYou remember \u201cOur Town,\u201d don\u2019t you? That canonical play from the 1930s that recorded the cycles of life in the unremarkable New England village of Grover\u2019s Corners? Why, come to think of it, \u201cOur Town\u201d takes place in New Hampshire, too! Standing before us on a platform in the middle of rolling farmland, his silhouette framed by a red barn draped with the stars and stripes, the candidate seems as if he could indeed be a figure conjured out of Wilder\u2019s imagination: a pleasant fellow of homespun virtues, the sort who would leap to help a little old lady cross a street.\n\nMayor Pete maintains a gentlemanly facade offstage. He\u2019s preternaturally mild-mannered. In two days of watching him work New Hampshire crowds, from a meet-and-greet in a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in Manchester to a walking tour of downtown Lebanon and a boisterous college-town rally in Hanover, I never once saw the mask of calm come off. He never seems to get steamed up, rarely even raises his voice. Pete the Imperturbable.\n\n\u201cLook, we can throw an elbow if we have to,\u201d he declares at another stop, with the confident reserve of an Atticus Finch.\n\nSo maybe, you start to think, it\u2019s not a mask.\n\nBut who is Mayor Pete? Of all the presidential candidates I\u2019ve followed so far, as a theater critic examining the distinct performance styles of a Democratic cast that includes Kamala D. Harris, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, Buttigieg struck me as hardest to get to know through his public performances.\n\nThis may be intentional, for the South Bend, Ind., mayor (nee Peter Paul Montgomery Buttigieg) likes to present himself as a man of ideas, and to heck with personal disclosure. Over the course of eight events, I learned surprisingly little about his personal life, what makes him tick and even where he grew up. It\u2019s not that the subject is verboten: He\u2019ll mention his husband, Chasten, a drama teacher, and their two dogs, Buddy and Truman, who have a Twitter account with 85,000 followers. He\u2019s just got a whole raft of other stuff he\u2019d rather stress. When traveling with Pete, buckle up for a wonky ride. Yet, in his mellifluous baritone, the voice of a morning drive-time radio news reader, it is all easy listenin\u2019.\n\n\n\nButtigieg runs to the stage to speak in Hancock, one of several stops in New Hampshire. (Cheryl Senter for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about liberty. Let\u2019s talk about freedom,\u201d he says to the crowd gathered at the Hancock farm. The cadence of his delivery is unmistakably reminiscent of another Midwestern politician whose poise he recalls: Barack Obama. He\u2019s even adopted Obama\u2019s penchant for a singsong intonation at the end of a phrase, and the 44th president\u2019s famous whistling \u201cs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd let\u2019s talk about a presidency,\u201d Buttigieg adds, \u201cin which freedom means more than cutting a regulation on a bank somewhere.\u201d\n\n[Kamala Harris grew up in a mostly white world. Then she went to a black university in a black city.]\n\nThe bank, the grocery store, the flag. The symbols he embeds in the minds of audiences in his seamless presentations are invested with mythic national status. They\u2019re images in an updated Norman Rockwell painting, one that seeks to reclaim bedrock Americana as the trademarks of the liberal side of the conversation.\n\n\u201cWe just have to break the spell of people thinking that values belong to one political party,\u201d he says. \u201c \u2019Cause I\u2019m not talking about conservative values. I\u2019m talking about American values.\u201d\n\nThe Midwestern politician says we \"have to break the spell of people thinking that values belong to one political party.\" Buttigieg's mayoralty, it seems, has taught him a kind of patient interest in everyone. People shield their faces from the sun using campaign signs while listening to Buttigieg.

BOTTOM RIGHT: People shield their faces from the sun using campaign signs while listening to Buttigieg. (Photos by Cheryl Senter for The Washington Post)\n\nIn \u201cOur Town,\u201d Wilder professed a similar kind of ecumenical philosophy about civility, and civic life. A moment arises in the play when the narrator, the Stage Manager, calls upon the local newspaper editor, Mr. Webb, to enumerate some vital statistics about Grover\u2019s Corners, pop. 2,642.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re lower middle class: sprinkling of professional men \u2026 10 percent illiterate laborers,\u201d the editor reports, and goes on to break down the numbers of Republicans, Democrats and Socialists. \u201cReligiously, we\u2019re 85 percent Protestants; 12 percent Catholics; rest, indifferent.\u201d\n\nThe point of the recitation is that numbers don\u2019t tell you much, and percentages that might seem definitive don\u2019t define the truth of shared experience in a small town. It is only when the editor is asked whether there is any \u201cculture or love of beauty\u201d in the community that you get the richer sense of everyone being basically the same.\n\n[Bill de Blasio is running for president. But can he do his day job?]\n\n\u201cNo ma\u2019am, there isn\u2019t much culture,\u201d Mr. Webb replies, \u201cbut maybe this is the place to tell you that we\u2019ve got a lot of pleasures of a kind here. We like the sun comin\u2019 up over the mountain in the morning and we all notice a good deal about the birds. We pay a lot of attention to them. And we watch the change of seasons, yes, everybody knows about them.\u201d\n\nI can almost hear Mayor Pete saying something of the kind, to distill the character of his citizenry to simple plain-spoken aphorisms. He\u2019s a small-city executive with a capital city r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 Harvard graduate, military veteran, Rhodes scholar \u2014 and you can intuit at times his determination not to sound supercilious, or to flaunt his achievements. (His Navy service in Afghanistan is the credential he trots out most often.) Only occasionally does he reveal a more cerebral side, as when, during a town hall at Nashua Community College, the question pulled out of a fishbowl by the student host is: What is your favorite symphony?\n\n\n\nButtigieg speaks in Nashua, N.H. While there, he revealed his favorite symphony during a town hall. (Cheryl Senter for The Washington Post)\n\nJust imagine, for a moment, that inquiry being made of the current occupant of the White House. Or even of Joe Biden, for that matter. What does it tell us about Buttigieg that his reflexive reaction is to give a totally earnest reply, and damn any snickers or taunts of elitism?\n\n\u201cBeethoven\u2019s Seventh,\u201d he declares. \u201cI gotta go with the Seventh.\u201d\n\nHis mayoralty, it seems, has taught him a kind of patient interest in everyone. His focus on a questioner, whether at a country fair or in a college gymnasium, is canine in its intensity. And he\u2019s of such altruistic demeanor, you can imagine a younger version of him sitting behind a folding table in a high school cafeteria, handing out homemade buttons for his student council run.\n\n[Is Bill Weld the Hero Never Trumpers Have Been Waiting For?]\n\nAt a craft fair in Newport, in the western half of the state, a middle-aged woman took in Buttigieg\u2019s trim physique approvingly as he shook hands and posed for photos. \u201cIt would be good,\u201d she was overheard to say, \u201cto have some cute guy in there, instead of that paunchy \u2026\u201d\n\nHer provocative description of the current president cannot be fully elucidated here. But the observation about Buttigieg\u2019s appeal does seem germane to a certain Kennedyesque feature of his campaign, and its most self-conscious aspect: his youth, in comparison, certainly, to the candidates currently at the top of the heap \u2014 76-year-old Biden, 70-year-old Elizabeth Warren, 78-year-old Bernie Sanders.\n\nSupporters and curious voters including Allie Campbell of Hollis N.H., sitting, wait to hear Buttigieg speak in Nashua. The 37-year-old Buttigieg's youth stands out amid other candidates in their 70s.

(Photos by Cheryl Senter for The Washington Post)\n\nThat gaze of almost unsettling sincerity that he trains on an interlocutor has a habit, though, of making Mayor Pete seem a bit studied \u2014 an even-tempered robot. On a stage, like the portable one in Hancock, he tends to repeat the same gestures over and over, like an actor with only a rudimentary tool kit (where is Chasten when he needs him?). And he carries politeness to an extreme. During the lengthy question-and-answer portions of his appearances, which he genuinely seems to dig, he walks to the edge of the platform and listens as if he\u2019s a grateful guest. He always remembers to thank the questioner \u2014 a proclivity shared by some other candidates \u2014 but with Buttigieg it can have an especially patronizing ring. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s following stage directions that say \u201cdisplay humility.\u201d\n\nIn Lebanon, a city of about 14,000 just south of Dartmouth College, Buttigieg goes on a tour of downtown with some local officials, an event Wilder could have scripted. Over here is Scratch, the yarn store, where a bunch of women are gathered to knit; over on the other corner is the Salt Hill Pub, where New Hampshire residents Derry LaBombard and Claire Connolly show up to get the candidate\u2019s signature on the requisite politician\u2019s memoir, \u201cShortest Way Home,\u201d published earlier this year. And then, Buttigieg and a small scrum of reporters and staffers make their way to the fire station, to greet the fire captain and a couple of Lebanon firefighters.\n\nMayor Pete knows this part of the script by heart. \u201cHow long are your shifts?\u201d he asks the firefighters.\n\n[Cory Booker and the Orthodox rabbi were like brothers. Now they don\u2019t speak.]\n\nHis stare is dialed up to laser beam. His manner is unfailingly courtly. The candidate is engulfed in a mist of affability so fragrant that one has no idea if he\u2019s enjoying the attention, let alone feeling content with the results.\n\nIt\u2019s the fourth event of the day in New Hampshire, and Buttigieg still has that campaign appearance in Hanover to get to. As the Stage Manager puts it in \u201cOur Town,\u201d \u201cThe day\u2019s running down like a tired clock.\u201d\n\nBut Mayor Pete never tires. Or, if he does, you\u2019d never know it.\n\n\n\nEven after days of campaigning, Buttigieg remains affable. (Cheryl Senter for The Washington Post)\n\nStory by Peter Marks.
