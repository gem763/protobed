Johnson & Johnson is also involved in the discussions to contribute additional money, some of the people said.\n\nPlayers up and down the pharmaceutical supply chain, including drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies, have been sued by virtually every state and thousands of city and county governments. Over 2,000 lawsuits allege the industry\u2019s overly aggressive marketing of prescription painkillers and lax oversight over drug distribution contributed to widespread opioid addiction.\n\nIf finalized, the settlement would be the first to achieve a broad resolution of the opioid lawsuits outside of bankruptcy. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP filed for bankruptcy last month to try to implement a settlement valued at around $10 billion to $12 billion but faces opposition from some states that say its owners\u2014members of the Sackler family\u2014should contribute more to the deal.\n\nAt least 400,000 people have died in the U.S. from overdoses of legal and illegal opioids since 1999, according to federal data. The lawsuits are seeking to recoup the costs borne by communities grappling with widespread addiction, including burdens on emergency services, medical care and foster services for children born to addicted parents.\n\nPressure has mounted on pharmaceutical companies to settle the opioid lawsuits and cap the liability. McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health are among companies slated to go to trial Monday in federal court in Cleveland in the cases of two Ohio counties that have been chosen to serve as a bellwether for the broader litigation.\n\nAny final deal could include other companies. The talks have raised the idea that the settlement would include the donation of opioid-addiction treatment drugs.\n\nJohnson & Johnson reiterated on Tuesday a prior statement that \u201cwe remain open to viable options to resolve these cases, including through settlement.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Cardinal declined to comment. AmerisourceBergen also declined to comment, and McKesson didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe agreement still needs to garner support from factions of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and government entities with differing interests.\n\nA bipartisan coalition of the attorneys general in Texas, Tennessee, Pennsylvania and North Carolina have been leading the discussions that generated the current proposal, the people said. State attorneys general were scheduled to have a call Tuesday evening to hear more about the potential deal.\n\nThe opioid litigation has been likened to lawsuits against the tobacco industry in the 1990s. Those suits led to a $206 billion settlement in 1998 that has trickled down to the states in installments ever since.\n\nLocal governments unhappy with how the tobacco money largely stayed at the state level didn\u2019t want to wait on the sidelines this time around, so cities and counties have pursued their own opioid lawsuits in addition to state attorneys general actions.\n\nU.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, who is overseeing the consolidation of thousands of the opioid cases filed in federal court, has strongly pushed settlement talks since early 2018.\n\nThe looming deadline of the trial slated to begin Monday before Judge Polster, in the cases of Ohio\u2019s Cuyahoga and Summit counties, has hastened the discussions.\n\nSeveral drugmakers have reached settlements with the two counties to avoid going to trial, but those deals haven\u2019t gotten them out of the broader litigation.\n\nAny global resolution by the distributors could affect or delay the trial, though jury selection was still set to begin Wednesday, and opening statements were on track for Monday.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have been seeking a large payday from McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal, which collectively controlled 95% of the U.S. drug distribution market in 2018, according to Drug Channels Institute, which provides research on the drug-supply chain.\n\nA smaller distributor, Henry Schein Inc., is also a defendant in the Cleveland trial, along with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. All of the companies were in court Tuesday before Judge Polster to hash out final details around how the two-month trial will look.\n\nPlaintiffs have alleged that the drug distributors failed to implement adequate systems to halt suspicious drug orders as the opioid epidemic came into focus.\n\nThe companies counter that they served as middlemen that followed federal regulations and have long had robust systems in place to monitor suspicious orders.\n\nPotentially bolstering the distributors\u2019 case is a recent report from the U.S. Justice Department criticizing the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for allowing drug manufacturers to increase significantly the production of powerful painkillers as overdose-death rates soared.\n\nThe Ohio counties and other plaintiffs have laid out plans to spend billions of dollars from potential settlements to help communities recover from widespread opioid addiction.\n\nThose plans include reducing the supply of opioids, coming up with new ways to care for patients in pain and treating those already addicted through programs and drugs like naloxone.\n\nThe first opioid case to go to trial, in Oklahoma, ended in a $572 million verdict against Johnson & Johnson that Oklahoma state court Judge Thad Balkman said should go toward addiction treatment, overdose prevention services and other resources.\n\nJohnson & Johnson was in court Tuesday arguing that the verdict should be reduced. Judge Balkman said at the hearing he agreed with the company that he made a math error that will reduce the verdict by more than $100 million, and that he would take other arguments under consideration before issuing a final judgment.\n\nWrite to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com", "description": "Three major drug distributors are in talks to pay $18 billion to settle sweeping litigation brought by state and local governments blaming them for fueling the opioid crisis.", "authors": ["Sara Randazzo", "Sara.Randazzo Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-117148/social", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
