Asante.\"\n\nPATRICK SANG, KIPCHOGE'S COACH\n\n\"He has inspired all of us that we can stretch our limits in our lives. You have made history.\n\n\"Everything went perfectly right. For the sport, it challenges other young athletes. For humanity, whatever level you are in you can move yourself to another level.\"\n\nTEAM INEOS TEAM PRINCIPAL DAVE BRAILSFORD\n\n\"Eliud is a once in a generation athlete and if anybody deserves to break the two-hour barrier it is him. It was an incredible performance and a privilege to be here.\n\n\"It was a great lesson in a very evenly paced run. He was very calm and conservative and the pacemakers took Eliud to the last kilometre for him to bring it home.\"\n\nTEAM INEOS OWNER JIM RATCLIFFE\n\n\"That last kilometre where he actually accelerated and came through on his own was just superhuman.
