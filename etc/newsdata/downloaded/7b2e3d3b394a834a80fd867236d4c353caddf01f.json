Officer and he served at various places during his career\u2026 My mother is a graduate and is a Writer. Siblings are Doctor\u2019s & Lawyer\u2026I did my schooling from Kendriya Vidyalaya Ganesh Khind, Pune and moved on for B.Sc. to Garware College, Pune. Further I did my M.C.M. from Indira Institute of Management. After completing my studies, I joined one of the reputed companies as an Executive and toiled hard over next few years to reach the position of a Manager. But I always wanted to do something different and slowly started getting involved in other areas and activities along with my work. I got a lucky break one day while watching the play rehearsals of one of my office colleagues. I wanted to give acting a try and my colleague helped me get an opportunity in the same play \u201cOrder- Order\u201d and then I did not look back. Now along with my job, I started devoting my time and energy into Acting and Social work activities. I was a part of a few Short Movies like Rokam, Rokeeda, Prajakta along with my Social work. Even these movies were on Social awareness causes like save girl child, education, mobile addiction, Andha Shraddha Nirmulan etc. Due to my inclination towards Social causes, all the work I did in these movies was honorary and I did not charge a single penny for the same.\n\nI have also walked on Ramp for Plastic ban & Won title of \u201cIron Lady\u201d through Maharashtra Ladies Association. I was honored by Wipro Cares on occasion of Woman\u2019s day for my support given to NGO\u2019s. I was also awarded by MePadvidhar team for my Good job in Social Work\n\nI have made many videos on NGO\u2019s which needs support & flashed on my YouTube channel \u201cElixir Productions\u201d & flashed on social media for people to come forward & help\u2026I\u2019m also a blog writer for one of the reputed newspaper, where I have highlighted challenges/ information of NGO\u2019s\u2026 My work for Various social causes like \u201cGive water to birds during summer\u201d, Swatch Bharat Abhiayaan, Help NGO\u2019s etc was appreciated by Leading Newspaper\u2019s\u2026\n\nI also do photography which covers Society challenges like Save Tree, Child Labor & have got them published in Leading Newspapers for people to work on the issues\u2026\n\nI got certificate of nomination from iB Hubs Super 30 as Best teacher \u2026\n\nI did not let my office work suffer due to these activities and got involved in these activities on my weekends after dedicated 5 days of office work. On weekends, I generally spend my time in Orphanages with kids. We get involved in activities like Storytelling, Jokes, Singing, reading and dancing. It instills a lot of positive energy in me after seeing the lovely smiles on their innocent faces. Also even I get to learn a lot from these lovely angels.\n\nI strongly advocate the view of Coming out of our comfort zone and spreading our services towards our society as well and not restrict ourselves to our family and office. Also, we should have more movies on social causes which will help in spreading the awareness on these issues and help in bringing more people who would be eager to contribute towards these.\n\nAll of us should get above the material pleasures in life and pass back some of the happiness to the not so privileged people in our society. It need not be a very big contribution, rather it can be as small as helping poor people get some education or helping the old and unattended people sometimes so that we can bring a smile on their faces. It will give you a bigger satisfaction than any promotion or Financial gains can give you.\n\nIf we all start doing this and motivate others to do this, the society will be a better place to live and human values will again start being respected. Nobody can succeed or stay without society or Human relations. In current situation, it really worries me to see that Human values and relations have taken a backstage to the material pleasures. If we all take small steps towards social upliftment, we can make a huge difference in the society.\n\nI would give full credit to my mother for instilling this thought process in my mind which has always given me energy and passion to move in", "description": "Now a days everyone is attracted towards Film Industry but, it is not easy to succeed there \u2026It requires a lot of struggle and perseverance to gain Success there\u2026Even I admire this industry a lot...", "authors": ["Sweta Danane"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SH.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
