(What\u2019s The Washington Post\u2019s latest tally? 13,435? Whatever: Just imagine a whirring odometer on a shuttle to Mars.) It\u2019s that he\u2019s surrounded by occluders and toadies, nihilist tricksters spun directly from the looms of the Marx Brothers\u2019 imagination. (\u201cWho you gonna believe? Me or your own eyes?\u201d)\n\nA raft of House and Senate Republicans \u2014 including (say it with me) Senator Lindsey Graham \u2014 learned that our top diplomat in Ukraine had confirmed the Trump administration\u2019s aid-for-dirt caper, yet still insists the impeachment proceedings are a sham. The acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, acknowledged this same quid pro quo in a news conference, only to proclaim later that none of us understands English. Any public servant who dares say that two plus two just might equal four is immediately accused by Trump of radicalism, treason, witch hunting.\n\nCompare that with President Barack Obama\u2019s relationship with those who inconvenienced him. When James Comey, then the head of the F.B.I., made the fateful decision to announce that he\u2019d reopened his inquiry into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails just days before the 2016 election, Obama could not have been especially pleased. By imperiling Clinton\u2019s chances, Comey was imperiling Obama\u2019s own legacy too. Yet Obama still behaved warmly toward him, according to James Stewart in his new book, \u201cDeep State.\u201d Why? Because \u201cDemocrats,\u201d as Jonathan Chait explained in his review of that book, \u201cstill believed in institutions and norms.\u201d\n\nThis idea \u2014 that Democrats still believe in norms, customs, the rather crucial notion of checks and balances, in government itself \u2014 may be the crux of the multiverse problem. Look at someone like Joe Biden, whose essential pitch (in addition to experience, incremental change, working-class-guyness) is that he can work with the men and women on the other side of the aisle.\n\nBut this suggests that compromise is an option. It doesn\u2019t appear that the other side is much interested. You have Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, holding a Supreme Court appointment hostage for nearly a year, blocking almost all legislative debate and passing a bill to protect the 2020 elections from foreign interference only under extreme duress; the world\u2019s \u201cgreatest deliberative body\u201d is now a speedway for the Trump agenda. You have the House Republicans informally observing the \u201cHastert Rule\u201d\u2014 named for the former speaker Dennis Hastert, who was carted off to prison for paying hush money to a former student he\u2019d sexually abused \u2014 which says bills can come to the floor only if a majority of the Republicans support them. It virtually ensures minoritarian rule.", "description": "Thanks to Trump\u2019s deepening dependence on \u201calternative facts,\u201d the assertion of reality is now a viable campaign strategy for 2020 Democrats.", "authors": ["Jennifer Senior"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/26/opinion/25senior/25seniorWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
