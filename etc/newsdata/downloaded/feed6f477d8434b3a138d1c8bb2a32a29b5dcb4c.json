The answer is no.\"\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the salon had not provided evidence that staff could deal with an adverse reaction, and the post was therefore misleading.\n\nThe salon also breached rules by advertising Botox, a prescription-only medicine.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Kylie Jenner founded a billion-dollar beauty company\n\nTwo other Instagram posts, one by beauty salon Queen of Aesthetics advertising the \"Kylie Jenner Package\" consisting of lip, cheek and jawline fillers, and another for Faces by AKJ Aesthetics, also for fillers and including an image of Jenner, were banned.\n\nThe ASA challenged whether the ads misleadingly suggested the package would give customers lips, cheeks and a jawline that closely resembled those of US media personality Ms Jenner and advertised a prescription-only medicine.\n\nQueen of Aesthetics said it had not posted any ad that told their customers they could make them resemble Kylie Jenner, adding that it would be \"almost impossible\" for a customer to look like anyone other than themselves after a non-surgical cosmetic procedure.\n\nFaces by AKJ Aesthetics said it used Ms Jenner's picture because she was recognisable to their target audience and showed the areas that could be treated, rather than to imply that their treatment could make consumers look like her.\n\nBanning both ads, the ASA told Queen of Aesthetics not to suggest celebrities had used their products if they had not, and warned Faces by AKJ Aesthetics not to trivialise non-cosmetic procedures, not to advertise Botox again and not to suggest celebrities had used their products if this was not true.\n\nCosmetic filler procedures can cost several hundred pounds, and should not be rushed into, according to the NHS.\n\n\"Some people look at a cosmetic procedure to solve life problems, or during difficult times in their lives,\" the NHS advises on its website.\n\n\"Do not assume that a cosmetic procedure will make everything better.\"\n\nKylie Jenner became a billionaire at 21 with her beauty business after gaining global recognition in her family's reality TV show Keeping Up with the Kardashians.", "description": "The Instagram ads misled customers and suggested celebrities had used the treatments, the ASA found.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C6A4/production/_108925805_kardashians.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
