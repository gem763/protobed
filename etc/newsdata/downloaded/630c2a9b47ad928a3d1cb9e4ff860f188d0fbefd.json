He should be praised as one of the funniest guys to ever inhabit the office. On Thursday, ahead of the third 2020 Democratic presidential debate, President Donald J. Trump told his Democratic rivals that being president is \"fun\" and \"easy.\" Know why? Because he makes all the decisions.\n\n\"A lot of people want the job. It's a great job. It's great because it's a lot of fun to work with Donald Trump and it's very easy actually to work with me. Know why it's easy? Because I make all the decisions and they don't have to work,\" Trump told the press pool.\n\nPresident Trump - Fun and Easy ??\n\n\"A lot of people want the job. It's a great job.
