We\u2019ve got you covered.\n\nStadia Launch\n\nStadia, Google\u2019s cloud video game streaming service, will launch on November 19th.\n\nPixel Buds\n\nGoogle went back to the drawing board with its answer to the AirPods. Shipping sometime in \u201cSpring 2020\u201d, the new Pixel Buds will cost $179. Google says the battery should last about 5 hours per charge, with the familiar floss-style charging case packing an additional 24 hours worth of charge. On-board microphones will adapt the sound based on your environment, and help to cancel out background noise like wind.\n\nPixelbook Go\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since Google shipped a higher-end Chrome OS laptop \u2014 but with Pixelbook Go, they\u2019re taking another swing at it. It\u2019s got a 13.3\u2033 display, up to 16GB of RAM, up to 256GB of storage, with the company promising around 12 hours of battery life. It\u2019ll weigh roughly 2lbs, with a base model that\u2019ll cost $649.\n\nNew Nest Aware\n\nNest Aware (which lets you add cloud recording to your Nest cameras) used to cost a few bucks per device. Now it\u2019s a flat fee, regardless of how many cameras you\u2019ve got. $6 per month gets you 30 days of \u201cevent\u201d history (read: just the bits of video where things are actually happening), while $12 per month gets you 60 days of event history and 10 days of 24/7 video history.\n\nNest Aware also now lets you put your Nest Minis/Nest Hubs into a security-centric listening mode, with the smart speakers listening for things like smoke alarms and dogs barking and sending you notifications accordingly.\n\nThey\u2019ll switch to the new pricing structure in \u201cearly 2020\u201d.\n\nNest WiFi\n\nAs rumored over the past few weeks, Google is mashing up the concepts of its Google Wifi mesh router with its Google Home speakers, voltroning them into Nest WiFi \u2014 a router/smart speaker hybrid. They\u2019ll ship starting on November 4th; a two pack will cost $269, with a three pack going for $349.\n\nNew Nest Mini\n\nThe Google Home Mini is now the \u201cNest Mini\u201d, and a bit has changed beyond the name. It\u2019s now wall mountable without any adapters, with a speaker that Google says offers up double the bass. Its got a new machine learning chip on board for faster responses, and more microphones to work better in louder environments. It\u2019ll ship on October 22nd for $49.\n\nPixel 4\n\nAfter an endless series of leaks, the next generation of Pixel \u2014 Google\u2019s flagship Android phone \u2014 is officially official. The Pixel 4 will come in at 5.7\u2033 with a 2,800mAh battery, while the Pixel 4 XL comes in at 6.3\u2033 with a 3,700mAh battery. They\u2019re both running on the Snapdragon 855 chipset with 6GB of RAM. They\u2019ve both got \u201cProject Soli\u201d radar chips inside, allowing you to do things like switch songs, snooze alarms, or silence calls by waving your hand over the phone without actually touching it.\n\nThe main focus here for Google is the cameras, with the company leaning hard into the idea of using machine-learning and AI-centric software to improve photos \u2014 things like live HDR preview with dual exposure controls, AI-driven \u201clearning\u201d white balance, and an improved Night Sight mode that can handle taking photos of star-lit nights. Both phones have two cameras on the back (12.2 megapixel f/1.7 main camera and a 16 megapixel f/2.4 telephoto lens) and one on the front (8 megapixels).
