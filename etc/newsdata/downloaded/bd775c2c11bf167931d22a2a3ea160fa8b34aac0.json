Lorenzo Reyes delivers this weeks power rankings and biggest risers and fallers. USA TODAY\n\nAfter five weeks of misery, the New York Jets finally got some good news Tuesday.\n\nStarting quarterback Sam Darnold has been cleared to return to the field after a bout with mononucleosis. He'll start on for the Jets on Sunday when they host the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nDarnold missed the last three games after being diagnosed with mono. Last week, the Jets were hopeful Darnold could return against the Eagles and gave him the majority of reps in practice before tests on Thursday showed his spleen was still inflamed.\n\nTuesday morning, Darnold underwent another round of tests and this time it came back all clear.\n\nThe Jets have started the season 0-4, losing all three of their games without Darnold. Third-string quarterback Luke Falk started the last two games after backup Trevor Siemian suffered a season-ending ankle injury in Week 2. The Jets scored only one offensive touchdown without Darnold.\n\nThe return of Darnold, the team's 22-year-old quarterback of the future, will certainly help. But there are deeper issues within the offense that must be fixed -- including an offensive line that just gave up 10 sacks against the Eagles.", "description": "After five weeks of misery, the New York\u00a0Jets finally got some good news Tuesday.
