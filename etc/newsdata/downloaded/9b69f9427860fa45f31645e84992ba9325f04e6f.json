But she\u2019s triumphant. She took on Obie Garbeau II (Ted Levine), the leader of the pervasive multilevel marketing scam that left her broke and killed her husband, and finally got a water park of her own. She\u2019s found stability, even if that means working with a company she knows is ruining lives everyday.\n\nKirsten Dunst plays Krystal with a calm demeanor but a searing bite \u2014 you never know if Krystal is going to hug someone or cut them. That Southern hospitality sometimes comes off like a two-faced cheerleader or a determined pageant queen (future on-air anchor), but Dunst never looked to her past roles for inspiration. \u201cShe was a beauty contestant, Krystal, so there\u2019s definitely that in there,\u201d the actress told Vulture, but \u201cit\u2019s just something that\u2019s part of my taste and wheelhouse of things I\u2019m drawn to.\u201d\n\nWith season two officially renewed at Showtime, Dunst is taking a break, \u201cjust being a mom\u201d to her son, Ennis, and getting ready to shoot Jane Campion\u2019s The Power of the Dog alongside Benedict Cumberbatch. Then, she\u2019ll be back to reckon with Obie Garbeau. After a finale with more twists than the tallest water slide at the best water park near Disney World, Dunst talked to Vulture about Krystal Stubbs\u2019s transformation from victim to scammer.\n\nCongrats on season two of On Becoming a God\ufeff! What was it about Krystal Stubbs that had you sticking by the show over three years and two network changes?\n\n\ufeffI know. [Laughs.] I mean, I almost walked away a couple times. I was like, This is \u2026 What\u2019s gonna happen with this show? But then I was like, It\u2019s a good role and I have fun playing it. She was just such a dynamic character and I love satire. I love dark comedies. It was just perfectly weird enough that I knew I would have a good time. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be, like, crying in every scene or stuff like that. You know, it\u2019s not like a heavy show in that sense. I appreciated that.\n\nShe gets into some pretty heavy stuff toward the end. Why do you think that she decides to blackmail Obie Garbeau in the finale rather than push forward without FAM? Up until that point it makes sense that she\u2019s taking all those risks to protect her daughter, Destiny, but suddenly she\u2019s taking this risk to get rich. She\u2019s betting bigger.\n\n\ufeffWell, she needs that water park. She doesn\u2019t have any other choice, really. Cody [Th\u00e9odore Pellerin] doesn\u2019t have any money. His mother\u2019s cutting him off. She could sell her house and figure out a way to, you know, find another job or move to another state. She does say that stuff with Cody, but there\u2019s just an opportunity to actually do something with her life, and I think that beauty contestant part of her, that dancer part of her, that performer, she\u2019s liking that attention, you know? The Splashercise thing is something that she really believes in. Yes, she wants to make money, but she\u2019s found something that\u2019s really something of her own and that people are really responding to that she created. So, I think it\u2019s her own pride, as well, of accomplishing this thing that she\u2019s come up with that\u2019s really driving her. And Obie\u2019s that person that could be blackmailed.\n\nDo you think that there was a possibility that she could\u2019ve just been like I want the money and not have to collaborate with FAM?\n\nYeah, I know what you mean about the Give me money and I\u2019m out. I think she wants to build an empire. Without it, she\u2019s gotta pay for this whole thing. She\u2019s gonna use FAM until she doesn\u2019t need FAM anymore and do her own thing. That\u2019s what I think.\n\nKrystal\u2019s such an independent thinker and that\u2019s why when her relationship with Cody takes this turn sort of in the middle of the season, it sort of energizes the story and makes it so that you never know what\u2019s going to happen next. Like, my jaw drops just thinking about how her relationship with Cody turns into this sexual degradation \u2026\n\nI know, it\u2019s so weird. It makes me so uncomfortable!\n\nReally?\n\nWell, \u2019cause I have to slap him in the face. It\u2019s just like, so not my vibe. I don\u2019t know, I just was very abusive to Theo and he\u2019d always be like, \u201cUhh, can you hit me harder? It\u2019s fine.\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay \u2026\u201d [Laughs.]\n\nWhat do you think about the way that sexual relationship affects Krystal?\n\nI think it\u2019s just that she has power over this little boy that\u2019s doing whatever she wants, that arouses her, but also she laughs in his face. So, for her, I think he\u2019s amusing. And also, she needs help wherever she can get it, you know?\n\nAt the end of the season, when they become partners in crime, do you think that being with him is still just out of necessity?\n\nI think that he\u2019s attached to the Garbeau world. He\u2019s been attached and I think he\u2019s her ally at that point. She doesn\u2019t have anyone and he\u2019s willing to help her and take care of her baby with her. It\u2019s hard to be a single mom. But then again, that could switch in an episode, too.\n\nWe learn about her in pieces throughout the season, and it looks like next season we\u2019ll find out a lot more about her family, but do you have your own Krystal Stubbs origin story?\n\nI do think that she comes from a poor family in the swamps of Florida. I imagine she comes from a family of addiction and poverty and that she was a survivalist who had to fend for herself since the beginning, which is why she\u2019s so angry and has this chip on her shoulder, doesn\u2019t trust people. And there\u2019s another thing that I think will happen in season two but I can\u2019t talk about it yet.\n\nI can\u2019t believe I just found out today that you have a tiny cameo on your fianc\u00e9 Jesse Plemons\u2019s Black Mirror episode.\n\nIt\u2019s not a cameo. It\u2019s literally \u2026 I was an extra one day. I was like, \u201cI\u2019ll do background!\u201d And I just walked through.\n\nAre we going to find out that you lurked in the background of El Camino?\n\nSadly, nope, I have not. I wasn\u2019t even on that set ever. That was all Jesse.\n\nOn a scale from \u201cyou knew the entire plot\u201d to \u201cyou caught Jesse sneaking off to New Mexico,\u201d what was the level of secrecy you guys had to maintain?\n\nI mean, I knew he was doing the movie. No one talked about it. Even at the premiere, Jesse didn\u2019t say he was in the movie. He was just like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m excited to see it.\u201d And when people asked him about it, he was like, \u201cOh, yeah, I look forward to seeing it.\u201d Like, he wasn\u2019t in it. He\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019ve never got to lie like that.\u201d It was so fun.\n\nGenerally, looking forward, what kind of roles are interesting to you?\n\nI\u2019ve always been more director-driven. For me, it\u2019s just working with people that I\u2019d love to work with in my life like that. I don\u2019t really care what part. I would like to do a musical, though, one day. That\u2019d be fun.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite musical that you\u2019d love to remake?\n\nWell, Les Mis is my favorite, but they already did that remake. I don\u2019t know, maybe an original. Like I know Charlie Kaufman wrote an original musical that never got made. So, something interesting like that would be really cool.\n\nWhat was it like playing Krystal, who has a newborn baby, and then also coming home and being with your baby?\n\n\ufeffThat actually helped me a lot because I knew things I wouldn\u2019t have known if I hadn\u2019t had a child. It\u2019s like, handing the baby an empty paper-towel roll and they\u2019ll be entertained. I wouldn\u2019t have necessarily known that had I not had a child. I think I would\u2019ve been a little more like, \u201cOh, is this okay? Is she okay?\u201d I would\u2019ve been more ginger with the baby, but because I have one I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, they\u2019re safe. They\u2019re safe, just hold \u2019em.\u201d\n\nThere are all these little times when Krystal\u2019s just like, \u201cHere, Destiny, play with this phone.\u201d Were those improvisations on your part?\n\nYeah, of course, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like [in episode two], the idea to go to Buzz\u2019s and borrow an ATV from him was an idea of mine to have my kid play with my keys and I see the keychain. So, I was like, \u201cHow are we gonna sell this?\u201d It\u2019s so stupid, like I\u2019m not gonna look at my keychain, like, Oh, yeah. Look at my keys in the bank. So, I gave it to the kid to play with and then I could see it from there. You just gotta interact with the baby.\n\nRaising Arizona was kind of my inspiration for how to interact with the baby, too. They use that baby for such comedy in that movie and I think it\u2019s so good when they do, so anytime we had an opportunity, I was like \u201cWe gotta use this baby.\u201d", "description": "Kirsten Dunst discusses the finale of \u2018On Becoming a God in Central Florida,\u2019 her role in Jane Campion\u2019s \u2018The Power of the Dog,\u2019 and how much she knew about Jesse Plemons\u2019s role in \u2018El Camino.\u2019", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/18/18-kirsten-dunst-chat-room-silo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
