Ombudsman'", "language": "en", "text": "The standup, Mock the Week panellist, and Absolute Radio newsreader on the things that make him laugh the most\n\nThe funniest standup I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026\n\nHans Teeuwen on my first visit to the [Edinburgh] fringe as a punter in 2010. I laughed so hard I fell off my chair.\n\nThe funniest book I\u2019ve ever read \u2026\n\nWhen I was a teenager my dad handed me a book wrapped up tightly in a bag and said: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be experiencing some \u2026 changes, so this might \u2026 help.\u201d I opened the bag to find the book was called Everything You Ever Wanted to Ask About Willies.\n\nThe funniest TV show I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026\n\nI couldn\u2019t breathe the first time I watched The Eric Andre Show. Really well thought-out, deeply intense insanity.\n\nThe funniest film I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026\n\nThe outtakes from Liar Liar. Not the film.\n\nThe funniest heckle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026\n\nA man put his hand up and asked me for two more pints of Carling. I said it wasn\u2019t really my job and he said: \u201cBut you\u2019re working here tonight, so it is.\u201d\n\nThe funniest dream I\u2019ve ever had \u2026\n\nI woke up in tears of laughter a few years ago, certain I\u2019d dreamed the greatest joke of all time, which I excitedly wrote down. When morning came, I saw I\u2019d just written: \u201cDog facepaint.\u201d Unlikely to open with it.\n\nThe funniest word \u2026\n\nOmbudsman. Never written a show without an ombudsman in it at least once. They pop up twice in the new show, so they\u2019re not going away any time soon.\n\nGlenn Moore plays Edinburgh, Sat; Glasgow, Sun; Reading, Fri; touring to 23 Jan", "description": "The standup, Mock the Week panellist, and Absolute Radio newsreader on the things that make him laugh the most", "authors": ["Harriet Gibsone"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/733ade9b1078573eb804861f237e2dd631d9c3e1/174_252_6901_4141/master/6901.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3f09b92a70f5807cd9e383a68a64526a", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
