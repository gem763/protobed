More suits are expected.\n\nThe claims could result in a protracted pursuit of Mr. Epstein\u2019s assets for many of his accusers. Mr. Epstein\u2019s will was filed last week in the U.S. Virgin Islands, spurring immediate questions about how his assets will be collected and distributed.\n\nCourt papers accompanying Mr. Epstein\u2019s will showed his estate to be worth at least $577 million. The value of his art, antiques and other personal property remains subject to appraisal. In a financial disclosure filed last month, Mr. Epstein listed properties in New York, New Mexico, Florida, Paris and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nJeffrey Epstein was found dead in jail Aug. 10.

In a 2010 lawsuit, lawyers for Mr. Epstein\u2019s accusers alleged that he transferred assets to prevent creditors from locating them. The suit was settled.\n\nFurther complicating the process, the women seeking compensation are navigating estate-law procedures and statutes of limitations in different states. Some lawyers are discussing ways to avoid a competitive free-for-all in which alleged victims race to the courthouse to obtain a judgment.\n\n\u201cThe federal courts handling these cases will be critical and should have the power to make sure that these victims are not left in limbo for years while Epstein\u2019s associates\u2019 profit,\u201d said Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer representing one of Mr. Epstein\u2019s accusers.\n\nMr. Epstein was found dead in a Manhattan jail cell Aug. 10, while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges stemming from what federal prosecutors alleged was a yearslong scheme to procure and sexually abuse dozens of girls. He had pleaded not guilty.\n\nJeffrey Epstein\u2019s mansion in Manhattan.

A federal judge also could force the estate to do so as the litigation progresses, some alleged victims\u2019 lawyers said.\n\nMr. Epstein\u2019s estate might wish to set up such a fund as a way to quickly resolve the claims and move on, Mr. Feinberg said.\n\nJeffrey Epstein owned Little St. James, an island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

A third party would determine the evidence needed to prove the allegations and calculate a formula for payouts, which often depend on the frequency and nature of the abuse.\n\nWomen who don\u2019t wish to participate in the fund could still pursue their own litigation in court.\n\nThe lawsuits in New York against Mr. Epstein\u2019s estate have moved ahead under a state law that went into effect last week and extended the statute of limitations for survivors of child sexual abuse to sue their abusers. It included a one-year period to file claims that have already expired.\n\nThe statute of limitations could pose a problem, however, for any women who wish to file lawsuits in other states. Federal prosecutors have accused Mr. Epstein of operating a sex-trafficking enterprise from at least 2002 to 2005, although a lawsuit filed against him this week contained allegations from as recently as 2012.\n\nNo lawsuits were pending against Mr. Epstein by alleged victims at the time of his death. In three prior lawsuits filed by women, Mr. Epstein paid a total of $5.5 million to settle them, according to court filings. Other suits against him and his associates also ended in settlements for undisclosed amounts.\n\nMr. Epstein signed his will on Aug. 8, two days before he was found dead in jail. The will directed that his assets be placed in a trust, whose beneficiaries haven\u2019t been made public. His closest relative is his brother, Mark Epstein.\n\nThe will named Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, two longtime associates of Mr. Epstein, as the estate\u2019s executors who are responsible for locating his assets and distributing them.\n\nThe two executors had earlier each hired criminal-defense lawyers in response to the investigation by Manhattan federal prosecutors into Mr. Epstein\u2019s alleged sex-trafficking enterprise, according to people familiar the matter.\n\nLawyers for Mr. Indyke and Mr. Kahn declined to comment.\n\nAnother avenue for the women to receive compensation could open if the government tries to seize Mr. Epstein\u2019s assets. To do so under a process known as civil forfeiture, federal prosecutors would have to prove to a judge or jury that it was more likely than not Mr. Epstein used his properties and other assets to facilitate his alleged sex-trafficking operation.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Should Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s accusers pursue damages against his estate? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nAfter Mr. Epstein\u2019s death, the Justice Department vowed to keep investigating the allegations against him, and federal agents last week searched his property in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Any evidence collected could be used in a civil forfeiture against his assets.\n\nIf the properties are successfully forfeited and sold, the Justice Department could set up its own fund allowing women to petition for claims.\n\nWrite to Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@wsj.com", "description": "Since Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s suicide earlier this month, at least six women have sued in New York seeking compensation for what they say is damage caused by years of sexual abuse by Mr. Epstein.
