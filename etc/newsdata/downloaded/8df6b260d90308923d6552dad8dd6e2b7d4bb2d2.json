Pictured, one of the computer-generated images\n\nThe system made a database which includes different sexes, races and ages and none of the people are real, but could easily be mistaken for a genuine portrait\n\nA remote team of 20 AI pros and photographers took 30,000 pictures of 69 models in a controlled environment to ensure consistent output quality.\n\nThe pictures were uploaded into an original machine-learning dataset with StyleGAN software which then constructed a realistic set of 100,000 'original' headshots.\n\nThe eerie images appear perfect in many cases, but there are often minor glitches, including eye sockets on foreheads, funky teeth and weird ears\n\nGenerated Photos has made the AI-generated faces completely free for use, provided the website is attributed.
