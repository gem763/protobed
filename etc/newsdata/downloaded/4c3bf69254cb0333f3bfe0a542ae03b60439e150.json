We need to understand these accounts better.\u201d\n\nShe added the number was \u201cless than five\u201d and the time between discharge and readmission ranged from five to 55 days.\n\nIt is not yet clear what was responsible, with theories including a resumption of vaping, that the injury had left patients more susceptible to infectious disease, that steroid treatment had made them vulnerable to infection, or steroid treatment was halted too quickly.\n\nThe CDC recommended every patient return for outpatient follow-up within seven days.\n\nShuchat told reporters that \u201cnational findings suggest products containing THC, particularly those obtained off the street or from unknown sources, are linked to most of the cases and play a major role in the outbreak.\u201d\n\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive component of cannabis and more than three-quarters of patients reported using it either exclusively or with nicotine products.\n\nNed Sharpless, the acting head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), reported that among samples tested of THC containing products, 47 percent contained Vitamin E acetate which is used as a cutting agent and is harmful when vaporized and inhaled.\n\nBut authorities cannot definitively exclude nicotine-products, since 13 percent of all patients reported nicotine use only.\n\n\u201cIt may take a few months to really understand the portion of the illness that is due to some new risky practice in the preparation of these materials or other causes,\u201d said Schuchat.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Some patients who have been discharged from hospital after recovering from lung injury associated with vaping have had to be", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/1500c5_300-people-so-far-fallen-ill-all-hospitalized-rate-new-cases-showing-no-signs-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
