He was compelled to do so by the Benn Act, which was passed by British MPs last month.\n\nU.K. lawmakers Tuesday night voted in favour of Johnson's Brexit deal, but refused to back his fast-tracked timetable to enshrine the deal into U.K. law before October 31.\n\nVaradkar and Tusk \u201cnoted that it would still be possible for the U.K. to leave before January 31st, 2020 if the Withdrawal Agreement has been ratified in advance of that date,\u201d the Irish government spokesman said.\n\nThe spokesman added that the Brexit extension is likely to be discussed further at the meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels this evening.
