He had to be helped off the field and could not put pressure on the leg. X-rays taken at Wrigley Field showed no fractures, and an MRI has been scheduled for Monday.\n\nChicago\u2019s postseason pursuit has already been hindered by an injury to shortstop Javier B\u00e1ez, who is out for the rest of the regular season with a hairline fracture of his left thumb.\n\nThe Cubs maintained their one-game lead over Milwaukee for the second NL wild card. The Nationals are 1 1/2 games ahead of Chicago for the first wild card.\n\nKris Bryant homered twice, and Ian Happ, Kyle Schwarber and Jonathan Lucroy also connected as Chicago battered Pittsburgh for a third straight day. The Cubs scored a total of 47 runs on 49 hits in completing the three-game sweep.\n\nChicago starter Jose Quintana was pulled after allowing five runs in the third inning, when he fell apart following Rizzo\u2019s injury.\n\nAfter Erik Gonzalez\u2019s leadoff double, Pirates starter Trevor Williams bunted toward third base. Rizzo charged aggressively from first and rolled his ankle a few steps before fielding the ball. He threw wide to first base and dropped to the ground in pain.\n\nBrad Wieck (1-1) later replaced Quintana with two on and struck out both batters he faced to end the inning. The Cubs rallied for five runs in the bottom of the inning to lead 8-5, starting with Bryant\u2019s second homer of the game and ending when reliever Michael Feliz threw wildly on an appeal play at third base.\n\nWilliams (7-7) allowed seven runs in 2 1/3 innings. Pablo Reyes drove in three runs for the Pirates.\n\nBryant gave the Cubs an early lead with a three-run blast in the first.\n\nHapp, who replaced Rizzo, hit a two-run shot in the fifth to make it 12-6. Jason Heyward drove in a run in the sixth and Schwarber hit a two-run shot in the seventh. Lucroy capped the scoring with a solo homer in the eighth.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPirates: 1B Josh Bell (groin strain) missed his second straight game. He is listed as day-to-day after exiting in the fifth inning on Friday. \u2026 OF Starling Marte (left wrist sprain) didn\u2019t start for the seventh straight game.\n\nCubs: Closer Craig Kimbrel (right elbow inflammation) threw 20 pitches in a bullpen session before the game. He reported no issues, but the team will see how he feels Monday before deciding on the next step. \u2026 INF Addison Russell was placed on the seven-day concussion list Sunday retroactive to Thursday. He was hit in the head by a pitch last Sunday at Milwaukee.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPirates: RHP Mitch Keller (1-4, 8.29 ERA) faces LHP Marco Gonzales (15-11, 4.30) Tuesday night in the opener of a three-game home series against Seattle.\n\nCubs: LHP Cole Hamels (7-7, 3.89 ERA) starts Monday night in the opener of a three-game series against the Reds. RHP Sonny Gray (10-7, 2.80) pitches for Cincinnati.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Star first baseman Anthony Rizzo was pulled from a game Sunday with a sprained right ankle, putting a damper on the Chicago Cubs' 16-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Jackson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/pirates_cubs_baseball_73518_c0-118-2814-1758_s1770x1032.jpg?726ffb50cf34401b768b2f62da2bdef97cbc891c", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
