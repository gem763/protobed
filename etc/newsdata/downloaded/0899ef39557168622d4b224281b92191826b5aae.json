The new formulation suggests that the Fed is not planning further rate cuts this year.\n\nThe statement described the labor market as strong and economic activity as risking at a \u201cmoderate\u201d pace.\n\n\u201cAlthough household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak,\u201d the Fed said.\n\nA year ago, the Fed was planning to raise rates several times this year, a policy it described as \u201cnormalizing\u201d interest rates. This plan was heavily criticized by President Donald Trump, who saw it as hurting his efforts to rev up economic growth. When the Fed seemed to persist in its policy despite some signs the economy was losing steam in the last quarter of 2018, financial markets staged big sell-offs of risk assets.\n\nThe market reaction was strong enough to convince the central bank to relent. In January, the Fed signaled that it had abandoned its policy of gradual rate hikes and it cut its target for the first time in a decade in July, describing the cut as a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment\u201d rather than a new direction for rates overall. The Fed cut again in September.\n\nWednesday\u2019s rate cut was widely expected. But investors will pay close attention to the words of Fed chair Jerome Powell at a press conference set to be held after the Fed meeting for hints of the Fed\u2019s next move.\n\nMany Fed officials believe that once the October cut is in place, the Fed will have done enough to innoculate the economy against a sharp downturn. And while there are some on the Fed who think it should continue to cut, they appear to be out-numbered by those who would rather take a wait and see approach. On Wednesday morning, the Commerce Department released that the economy had grown at a 1.9 percent annual pace in the third quarter, better than the consensus forecast.", "description": "The Fed delivered the quarter-point cut that the market expected on Wednesday. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1179027620-e1572456112994-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
