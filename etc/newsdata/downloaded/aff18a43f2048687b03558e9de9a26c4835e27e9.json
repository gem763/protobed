Subs not used: Simoes, Bahre, Walton, Thomas, Oduor Goals: Woodrow (17, 21) Booked: Collins, Andersen, Dougall, Cavare, Brown, McGeehan, Mowatt, Chaplin Referee: Darren Bond (Lancashire)\n\nAlbion boss Bilic said: 'We started to rush things, trying to play key balls, assists \u2013 sexy football in those situations and then we conceded two goals.\n\n'It's not basketball when you can score a three-pointer. Calm down, don't lose your shape.\n\n'I was confident we'd put them under pressure.'\n\nWest Brom maintain their two-point lead over Leeds.\n\n'I'm proud and pleased of the game we played but a little bit gutted we didn't hold on,' said Barnsley caretaker-boss Adam Murray.\n\n'It would have been a famous victory. It didn't feel like an eight-booking game.'\n\nPrior to the match, a shirt was placed on the seat of season-ticket holder Rob Spray, who died in Sofia earlier this month after travelling to watch England's Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria.\n\nMystery surrounds his death in police custody, with the family frustrated at the lack of clarity they have received until now.\n\nThe early signs offered little encouragement for Barnsley but against the run of play, they took the lead. Pereira was robbed on halfway, allowing wing-back Dimitri Cavare to charge down the right. His cross was met by the unmarked Woodrow with a solid header beyond Johnstone in the 18th minute.\n\nBarnsley striker Cauley Woodrow was in inspired form as he headed in the first of the game\n\nHe soon added a second and the Championship leaders were stunned to be down 2-0 at home\n\nWest Brom continued to create, Barnsley to frustrate. Shortly after the half-hour, Grady Diangana produced a clever piece of skill to tee up Darnell Furlong, only for his low ball to fly across the box with nobody able to apply the vital touch.\n\nInstead, it was Barnsley who doubled their lead, as Woodrow collected Alex Mowatt's pass 25 yards from goal and curled the ball beyond Sam Johnstone, who was a little slow moving to his right.\n\nAlbion boss Bilic hooked Edwards and Nathan Ferguson at half-time, sending on Filip Krovinovic and Conor Townsend. Yet Barnsley continued to threaten.\n\nThe impressive Cavare again found a crossing position and supplied Woodrow, whose looping header hit the crossbar.\n\nWest Brom were running out of ideas at the other end but were gifted a way back into the match when Diaby, under no pressure, headed Pereira's corner past his own goalkeeper at the near post. They were left to rue that error when Pereira planted home a downward header to set up a thrilling finish.\n\nBut they got a foothold in the game when Bambo Diaby (left) turned into his own net for 2-1", "description": "TOM COLLOMOSSE AT THE HAWTHORNS: The visitors were two goals up thanks to Woodrow but the game soon turned with Matheus Pereira striking nine minutes from time to secure a vital point.", "authors": ["Tom Collomosse For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/22/20056986-0-image-a-111_1571780338861.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
