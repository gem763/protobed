It was a very smart move", "language": "en", "text": "If recently leaked audio of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is any indication, Elizabeth Warren won\u2019t be touring Facebook\u2019s sprawling California campus any time soon. In uncharacteristically direct language, Zuckerberg slammed Warren\u2019s call for better regulation of Silicon Valley giants like Facebook and Google, even threatening to sue the federal government should Warren win the White House next year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, we care about our country, and want to work with our government and do good things,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cBut look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and fight.\"\n\nFor Warren, who has surged to the front of a crowded Democratic primary field in part by embracing unapologetically progressive positions, it\u2019s hard to imagine a better campaign ad.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s argument reveals the shocking tone-deafness great wealth creates and sustains. His problem isn\u2019t with Warren per se \u2013 Zuckerberg takes pains to express how much it would \u201csuck\u201d to sue the government \u2013 but with the idea that Warren isn\u2019t interested in letting Facebook dictate the terms of its own regulation.\n\nWith nearly $66 billion to his name, Zuckerberg is the fifth richest person in the world, and he hasn\u2019t been shy about using that money \u2013 and Facebook\u2019s $12.6 million lobbying behemoth in Washington \u2013 to fend off previous attempts at oversight.\n\nSometimes those efforts work, as seen in Facebook\u2019s successful effort to stymie state antitrust probes. But even when Facebook is punished, as it was by the FTC, who issued the company a record $5 billion fine in July 2019, the financial costs of misbehavior are a mere nuisance to a corporate titan worth nearly $500 billion.\n\nUnfortunately for Zuckerberg, Elizabeth Warren has a plan for that.\n\nOn October 1, Warren used the media buzz surrounding Zuckerberg\u2019s threats to announce a bold new plan to tax \u201cexcessive\u201d corporate and foreign lobbying. Warren\u2019s plan has the potential to cause a seismic shift in Washington power dynamics not seen since the end of the Second World War, when the trickle of lobbyist influence became a flood.\n\nCorporate lobbying is a massive industry. According to Karl Evers-Hillstrom of the campaign finance tracking website OpenSecrets, corporations and countries spent over $3.4 billion bending the ears of legislators and government regulators in 2018, the largest spend in eight years.\n\nWarren\u2019s tax kicks in when a corporation spends over $500,000 annually on Washington influence campaigns, with tax rates starting at 35 per cent and increasing to 75 per cent for lobbying over $5 million. That puts Warren at odds with mammoths of Washington influence like Facebook ($12.5 million), Google ($21 million), the National Rifle Association ($5 million) and nations like Saudi Arabia, which spends $11.1 million annually on DC lobbyists.\n\nWarren estimates that a lobbying tax would have generated over $10 billion in federal revenue over the past 10 years. And while that $10 billion is just a fraction of the federal budget, it would be enough to restore Trump administration cuts to essential social services like Meals on Wheels ($3 billion), which provides meals to homebound individuals. It would also negate Trump\u2019s proposed $4.5 billion cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food stamps and nutrition assistance to children and the elderly.\n\nWhile Silicon Valley plutocrats gather to decide how best to obstruct a Warren administration, there is growing evidence that her take-no-prisoners message is resonating with Democratic voters. The most recent Monmouth survey shows Warren vaulting into first place, with 28 per cent to Joe Biden\u2019s 25 per cent. Warren also enjoys slim leads in New Hampshire (+1) and Iowa (+2).\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Out-of-control lobbying is one of the few issues both Republicans and Democrats condemn, but neither side has yet been willing to take decisive action. Taxing corporate lobbying becomes more appealing when that revenue is made available for legislators\u2019 home-district pet projects.\n\nWashington has also soured on Silicon Valley after a cascade of data breaches, potential election interference and condescension from tech\u2019s multi-billionaire CEOs. One-time media darlings like Zuckerberg may not have the influence they believe, even with millions of dollars in corporate spin behind their arguments.\n\nElizabeth Warren\u2019s battle with Mark Zuckerberg generated a raft of positive media attention for Warren and an opportunity to announce her ambitious plans to rein in runaway corporate influence. Whatever Zuckerberg\u2019s intentions, his entitled, petty remarks only amplified press and activist attention around the massive influence wielded by tech\u2019s unelected czars. Zuckerberg\u2019s comments were, like so many attempts by Facebook to enter the political conversation, a spectacular backfire.\n\nMax Burns is a veteran Democratic strategist and senior contributor at Millennial Politics.
