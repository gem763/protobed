Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is an outspoken supporter of the Trump administration. But on Wednesday, he fired off a series of criticisms aimed at President Trump, in response to the commander-in-chief's previous statements about the senator's foreign policy.\n\nHis comments came after the president dismissed Graham's criticism at a press conference, saying that the South Carolina senator would want the U.S. to stay in the Middle East for a \"thousand years.\" He also claimed that Graham's constituents wanted to bring U.S. troops home rather than leave them in Syria.\n\nGraham, considered a foreign policy hawk, has been critical of Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops from Syria and claimed the president was responsible for Kurdish deaths after Turkey's incursion into the country. Kurds worked with U.S. forces in recent efforts to beat down the Islamic State terror group in the region.\n\nON SYRIA, TRUMP ACCUSES GRAHAM OF WANTING 'TO STAY IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR THE NEXT THOUSAND YEARS'\n\nAccording to NBC, Graham refused to back down on the issue and warned that conflict in Syria could be a \"defining moment\" for Trump.\n\n\u201cI will do anything I can to help him, but I will also become President Trump's worst nightmare. I will not sit along the sidelines and watch a good ally, the Kurds, be slaughtered by Turkey.\"\n\n\"This is a defining moment for President Trump. He needs to up his game,\" he reportedly said.\n\nThe senator also tweeted several times on Wednesday, warning that Trump's diplomacy could make Syria like Iraq after former President Barack Obama decided to leave.\n\nIn an apparent message to Trump, Graham said he would never be quiet on issues related to national security.
