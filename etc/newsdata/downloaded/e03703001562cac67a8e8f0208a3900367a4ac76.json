The Straits Times\n\nSingaporeans will soon see more autonomous vehicles on roads.\n\nThe entire western part of Singapore is set to become a testing ground for autonomous vehicles (AVs), with over 1,000km of public roads opened up for companies to conduct tests, Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Transport, announced on Thursday morning (Oct 24).\n\nThe change will be carried out gradually over the next fear years in an incremental manner, and public safety remains a top priority, Dr Puthucheary said.\n\nSpeaking at the Autonomous Mobility Summit at the Intelligent Transport Systems World Congress, the minister said that the expanded testbed area is in response to industry feedback that a more varied testing environment would accelerate development and open up \u201cnew challenging scenarios to AV developers\u201d.\n\nCurrently, the largest test site at Buona Vista measures just 70km. Existing test sites for AVs also include Jurong Island, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Sentosa.\n\nHe also warned that public acceptance is a key factor for widespread adoption of autonomous mobility and can be \u201ceasily eroded\u201d if accidents were to occur.\n\nTo achieve trust, both industry and authorities must continue to work closely together into to find a safety regime that \u201cstrikes the balance between innovation and safety\u201d, Dr Puthucheary said.\n\nSafety drivers must be on board \u201cat all times\u201d during AV trials, and all tests are subject to the Land Transport Authority\u2019s (LTA) approval, he added.\n\nThe testbed pilot programme was unveiled in 2017 with the aim of providing first-last mile commutes for residents in Punggol, Tengah and Jurong Innovation District.\n\nBesides expanding testbeds, Puthucheary said that the Government will be supporting the setup of \u201copen innovation platforms\u201d, which enables companies and local institutes to co-create mobility solutions. One such platform is the S$24 million testbed partnership between Singapore telco M1 and NTU.\n\n\u201cThese improvements are an important part of our strategy and roadmap to promulgate AV deployment in Singapore\u201d, the Minister said.\n\nThe trials and efforts to date and in the future will continue to \u201cgive us even more insights into the concepts of operations for the deployment of AVs at the town-level as well as the infrastructural requirements for such town-scale deployments,\u201d he added.\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - The change will be carried out gradually over the next few years, and safety drivers will be on-board at all times..
