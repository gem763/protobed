The council\u2019s speaker, Corey Johnson, who supported the proposal, called Rikers a \u201cstain on New York City.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe proposal also includes criminal justice reforms that, together with other changes at the state level, are expected to cut the city\u2019s incarcerated population by more than half in the next six years. But even then, the long-standing scars of Rikers \u2014 and the system that filled it with about 7,000 inmates at a time \u2014 has stirred a potent, emotional debate: Should those new jails be built to begin with?\n\nThe plan\u2019s not a sure thing. It will rely on the will of future city councils and mayors to close Rikers by 2026. Proponents say a reduced number of 3,300 inmates in those jails would be closer to courthouses, their own family members, and social services like mental health and job training.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is about valuing our people, no longer condemning people and sending them on a pathway that only made their lives worse and worse,\u201d said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said in a news conference after the vote. \u201cToday we made history: The era of mass incarceration is over.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut for some, like Jarrod Shanahan, who was jailed briefly at Rikers and co-authored a forthcoming book on the complex\u2019s history, he only sees history repeating itself.\n\n\u201cThe idea that a new jail can fix the problems of the old one is a long-standing misconception that has driven the carceral expansion of New York City,\u201d Shanahan, a criminal justice professor at Governors State University in Illinois, said in an interview with The Washington Post.\n\nAD\n\nOnce used to raise a pigs for slaughter, the island on which Rikers was originally built was named for the family of Richard Riker, a court reporter who terrorized black New Yorkers as part of a kidnapping ring in the 1800s.\n\nUpon the first jail\u2019s opening in 1935, the new facility was advertised as \u201can enormous model penitentiary,\u201d the New York Times wrote, \u201cample in size to serve for many years to come and which in all its plans and parts should be the most perfect prison in the world.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEven from the beginning, however, it suffered from severe problems: persistent rat infestations, spontaneous fires and an unassailable stench, CityLab reported, as prisoners were forced to pick through garbage later used as landfill to expand the island\u2019s size. It only grew from there, expanding to include 10 jails, a solitary-confinement complex, a power plant and more than a dozen beds next to the women\u2019s dorm, for babies who were born there, according to the Marshall Project.\n\nAD\n\nThe movement to close Rikers reached a crux following the death of Kalief Browder, who killed himself in 2015, shortly after his release. He had spent three years in jail there, without a trial or conviction, before his charge of allegedly stealing a backpack was eventually dismissed.\n\nEven then, other deaths and horrors make up a lengthy list. In 2008, a corrections officer was indicted for allegedly beating inmates and using a group of teens as enforcers. Five years later, inmate Bradley Ballard was locked in a cell for six days, and then found naked and covered in urine and feces. Earlier this year, Layleen Polanco, a transgender woman, died at Rikers after she was placed into a program that was, according to several former Rikers inmates, equivalent to solitary confinement.\n\nAD\n\nThose abuses propelled the city council to hire an independent commission to investigate the city\u2019s criminal justice system. But they also sparked a swell of grass roots activism, largely united around three words: No New Jails.\n\nAD\n\nThe presence of that campaign was unavoidable inside and outside Thursday\u2019s vote at City Hall, where supporters on the balcony shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re on the wrong side of history!\u201d and threw fliers over the railing that read: \u201cIf you cage our future, blood on your hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a safe, humane, dignified, or well-designed jail,\u201d group leader Brittney Williams told THE CITY. \u201cEvery jail in NYC is a torture chamber and the new ones will be the same.\u201d\n\nBLOOD ON YOUR HANDS!!! IF THEY BUILD IT THEY WILL FILL IT!! #NONEWJAILS PROTESTORS JUST SHUT DOWN THE VOTE AND WE WERE ALL KICKED OUT OF CITY HALL. #CLOSERIKERSNOW #NONEWJAILSNYC pic.twitter.com/DbLBGgbap3 \u2014 No New Jails NYC (@nonewjails_nyc) October 17, 2019\n\nAnd it extended to the floor of City Hall, where a dozen or so lawmakers voiced their opposition to the plan, on the grounds that it simply outsourced the problems that are currently present at Rikers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe conversation that started at City Hall has not gone far enough,\u201d said councilman Rafael Espinal (D), who represents a rapidly gentrifying sector of Brooklyn, according to the New York Daily News. \u201cWhen the city should have been pumping money into strengthening and nurturing my community, it was neglecting it.\"\n\nOpposition to the controversial plan also came from residents of neighborhoods where the new jails would be built, as well as some critics from the right, who argued that shuttering Rikers would make the city less safe. The Correctional Officers\u2019 Benevolent Association, which represents more than 10,000 officers, also said that goals of reducing the prison population were too optimist.\n\n\u201cThere is simply no way to cut the average daily jail population \u2026 that much more without leaving dangerous criminals on the street,\u201d wrote Rafael A. Mangual, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut all four of the lawmakers who would have jails expanded or built in their district voted in favor of the plan. So did Diana Ayala, a Democratic councilwoman from the South Bronx, dedicating her vote to a younger brother who had suffered from mental health issues and spent time in several jails, including Rikers.\n\n\u201cWe abandoned him as a community, we abandoned him as a city and we abandoned him as a family,\u201d Ayala said. \u201cI know in my heart I am doing the right thing.\"\n\nAD", "description": "The jail complex on Rikers Island was considered one of the country's most notorious facilities.", "authors": ["Teo Armus", "Reporter On The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wXuQ83iEqeitFGQ-s6-mPXQ6ayY=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/5da94ba846e0fb00097f6843/2019-10-18T050718Z_1_OVB1MQ6AZ_RTRMADC_0_NEW-YORK-RIKERS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
