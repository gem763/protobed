People reveal their darkest secrets in amusing Twitter account", "language": "en", "text": "A Twitter account which encourages people to share their anonymous confessions include those ranging from the hilarious to the completely outrageous.\n\nThe bio of Fesshole, which was created by UK-based Rob Manuel, who is the creator of subversive meme design website B3ta, reads: 'Confess your sins anonymously - will the internet absolve you?'\n\nAnd some of the most amusing admissions include a 50-year-old man who revealed he sucks his thumb when it's 'dark, late at night,' and another who told how everyone thinks she's a 'vegan.'\n\n'Everyone except for the lady at the roadside cafe, where I get a bacon and egg sandwich two to three times a week,' she added.\n\nTwitter account Fesshole, which was created by UK-based Rob Manuel, encourages members of the public to share the darkest secrets. Pictured, stock image\n\nAnd a prevalent topic in the series of hilarious confessions seemed to be little white lies told to friends.\n\n'At uni, I got hammered and microwaved a flatmates Nintendo Wii then put it back by the TV,' revealed one. 'To this day he thought it was an electrical fault with the console.'\n\nA second penned: 'Years ago I was moving country and gave my best friend my favourite bread knife to keep.'\n\n'Now whenever I visit him I get unreasonably jealous that he has it. I've been working out how to nick it back for ages but I can't put it in my hand luggage.'\n\nMany took to the Twitter account to anonymously submit their confessions. One admitted to buying fancy chocolate and leaving it in the car so none of their family could eat it (pictured)\n\nAnother told how he feels like a 'master criminal' when he weighs up 'expensive fruits as onions' at a supermarket till, while a further admitted to eating a bag full of doughnuts, smearing jam on the cupboards and ripping up the packet so he could blame his greediness on the dog.\n\nA third revealed that instead of walking her pooch, she just moves the lead about the house to make it look like she's 'done something with it.'\n\nBut one of the more stomach-churning revelations involves an apprentice whose site manager asked him to get him some French toast from the local shop.\n\n'I blew my nose on it before I gave it to him as a week previous he got me a verbal warning after he caught me reading his site diary,' he joked.", "description": "Twitter account Fesshole, run by Rob Manuel from the UK, encourages people to anonymously admit to any wrong-doings.
