In a private chat room, pro-Trump internet trolls discussed which memes, videos and news stories to push on social media in order to reclaim the narrative.\n\nThe last time America watched an impeachment inquiry, it was largely an analog affair. When the House voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton in 1998, only one in four American homes had internet access. AOL and Yahoo were the biggest websites in the world, and \u201ctweet\u201d was a sound birds made.\n\nIf the inquiry opened by House Democrats this week results in a formal impeachment of Mr. Trump, it will be the first of the social media era. In many ways, it is a made-for-the-internet event. The political stakes are high, the dramatic story unspools tidbit by tidbit and the stark us-versus-them dynamics provide plenty of fodder for emotionally charged social media brawls.", "description": "Disinformation experts are preparing for fast-twitch media manipulation, droves of false and misleading claims and hyper-polarized audiences fiercely clinging to their side\u2019s version of reality.", "authors": ["Kevin Roose"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/business/26roose1/26roose1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
