Brexiteers have long argued that Europe\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which exports hundreds of thousands of cars to Britain each year, would protect that trade.\n\nNissan is ending the night shift at the Sunderland plant and the overall headcount of staff will be a little lower at around 6,000 as it focuses on ramping up the new vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Editing by Stephen Addison)", "description": "Nissan  said it will begin making the next-generation Juke vehicle at Britain\u2019s biggest car plant on Monday, just over two weeks before a possible no-deal Brexit which the industry has warned could bring production to a halt.
