Corey pleaded not guilty and then refused to stand trial, so he was pressed to death under heavy stones.\n\nThe realities of the Salem witch trials, in which 14 women and six men were killed, were brutal and unforgiving. But to hear President Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani tell it, the witchcraft proceedings employed a higher standard of due process than the impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\n\u201cEven Salem witch trials didn\u2019t use anonymous testimony,\u201d Giuliani wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, a day after news reports said the identity of the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the inquiry could be obscured during his congressional testimony. \u201cThe accused had to be confronted by a witness willing to put their name and reputation behind the charges and then had to be available for cross examination.\u201d\n\nGiuliani again compared the inquiry into Trump to the witch trials in a conversation with Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Tuesday: \u201cThey actually want to impeach him on the testimony of hidden witnesses who are behind a curtain; we don\u2019t know who they are,\u201d he said, adding that he recently had read two books about the Salem witch trials.\n\n\u201cThe witches had it better, in other words,\u201d Ingraham commented.\n\n\u201cThey had more rights,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, in which Congress gathers information about the president\u2019s alleged impropriety, is not a trial. Giuliani\u2019s comparison of the probe to the Salem witch trials was partly accurate, but he also got a lot wrong.\n\n[The Salem witch trials: Why everyone from Trump to Woody Allen still invokes their hysteria]\n\nAlthough those suspected of practicing black magic have been persecuted at least since biblical times, hysteria around witchcraft in the United States peaked in the late 17th century. Young girls who started screaming and flying into \u201cfits\u201d would prompt local men to complain to a judge that someone was harming the girls through witchcraft. A dubious legal process would follow.\n\n\u201cUnder the English tradition of justice, you are innocent until proven guilty,\u201d said Emerson W. Baker, a history professor at Salem State University who has studied the witch trials. \u201cHowever, in 1692, that clearly did not happen.\u201d\n\nGiuliani was correct that accusers at the Salem trials had to attach their names to their testimony. His claim that people accused of witchcraft were confronted by the witnesses in their cases, however, was largely false.\n\nMany of the people who accused others of witchcraft never appeared at trial, Baker said. Instead, the supposedly afflicted girls would give depositions that were then presented in court. In these cases, there was no opportunity to cross-examine the accusers.\n\nTo start a witchcraft investigation, a person would complain about someone to a local judge. The judge would compel the sheriff\u2019s office to arrest the accused so they could appear before a panel of judges, who would determine whether there was enough evidence to detain them before trial.\n\nA grand jury then would decide whether to bring charges. Of the nearly 30 people in Salem who appeared before the grand juries in response to witchcraft allegations, Baker said only one was not charged.\n\nIn the Court of Oyer and Terminer (which means \u201cto hear and to determine\u201d), nine judges presided over trials. There were neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys, and the judges interrogated the accused as if they already had decided on their guilt. The questions, Baker said, were the 17th-century equivalent of \u201cWhen did you stop beating your husband?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you hurt these children?\u201d Judge John Harthorn asked Sarah Good during her trial on witchcraft charges in February 1692.\n\nAfter Good denied that she had hurt them or asked anyone else to hurt them, the judge asked Good \u201cwhat creature\u201d she employed to do it.\n\n\u201cNo creature, but I am falsely accused,\u201d Good responded, according to a transcript of her examination.\n\n[A Salem witch trials refugee settled here \u2014 where a home is selling for nearly $1 million]\n\nA key element of the witch trials was spectral evidence, which was witness testimony that the spirit or \u201cspecter\u201d of someone who was not physically present had appeared to the witness. People sitting in the courtroom, for example, could cry out in pain and yell that someone\u2019s spirit was afflicting them.\n\nThis type of evidence was considered questionable, Baker said. To convict someone of witchcraft, judges needed to have either a signed confession or two people who had seen the accused carry out an act of black magic. The evidence that opened a witchcraft case, however, was often spectral.\n\n\u201cSpectral evidence becomes absolutely critical,\u201d Baker said. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s convicted in Salem faces spectral evidence.\u201d\n\nA 12-man jury decided the verdict in each case, Baker said, and in almost every instance found the accused guilty. When a jury found one woman \u2014 Rebecca Nurse \u2014 not guilty, the chief judge suggested to them that they came to the wrong conclusion. The jury deliberated again and returned with a guilty verdict.\n\nThe sentence for a witchcraft conviction was execution by hanging. People who confessed to being witches, meanwhile, were kept alive in part so they could implicate their supposed accomplices, Baker said.\n\nSome of the accused were subjected to torture to try to get them to confess. One form included tying a suspected witch\u2019s neck to their heels and hanging them upside down by their belts until blood gushed out their noses. It was an early equivalent of waterboarding because it convinced the accused that they might die, Baker said.\n\nPoliticians and commentators of all ideologies have been known to reference the Salem witch trials to argue that a member of their preferred party is getting a raw deal in an investigation. The probe into former secretary of state Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in the 2012 Benghazi killings, for example, often was called a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a way to sort of tar your opponents as extremists,\u201d Baker said.\n\nRead more:\n\nSupreme Court, set to rule on LGBTQ rights at work, addressed gender discrimination 30 years ago\n\nThis article is for congressmen who think Captain Kangaroo presided over kangaroo courts\n\nTulsa searches for graves from 1921 race massacre that left hundreds of black people dead\n\nTwo centuries ago, University of Virginia students beat and raped enslaved servants, historians say", "description": "Giuliani, a personal attorney to the president, said suspected witches \"had more rights\" than Trump has in the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/251L9zSzdRVVq8FPlYhrPP2vBPM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GZW4CKHKUEI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
