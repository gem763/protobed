The president joked Thursday he would need \"a lot of heavy armor\" if threw out the first pitch.\n\n\u201cI don't know, they got to dress me up in a lot of heavy armor \u2014 I\u2019ll look too heavy,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office during a Presidential Medal of Freedom event. \u201cI don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nMajor League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Friday that he had spoken with Trump about whether he wanted to throw out the ceremonial first pitch on Sunday.\n\n\u201cHis view was that in order to make the fan experience as positive as possible, he would arrive at Game 5 sometime after the game began, so that wouldn\u2019t interfere with fans getting into the stadium. Quite frankly, we were very grateful for that,\u201d Manfred said, according to The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cHis sole focus was if I do something like a first pitch or arrive in that timeframe, is it going to be disruptive to the everyday fan getting into the ballpark and enjoying the game, and he didn\u2019t want that kind of disruption,\u201d Manfred added.\n\nThe Astros forced a fifth game after defeating the Nationals on Friday night 4-1. Washington led the series 2-0 heading into the game, which was the first World Series game in the city since 1933. The Astros' win ended the Nationals' eight-game winning streak.\n\nThe Nationals announced Friday that Andr\u00e9s would throw out the first pitch for Game 5 while highlighting the chef's organization, World Central Kitchen, for its efforts to feed large groups of people, including furloughed workers in D.C. and those affected by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.\n\n\"I\u2019m humbled by the invitation, and I realize is a big big big honor but I really hope that by Saturday night all of WASHINGTON will be celebrating that the @Nationals are the 2019 @MLB World Series Champions,\" the chef tweeted.\n\nWe will win tomorrow, and then on Sunday too! @Nationals We are with you!...Tomorrow is my practice day! #NationalsShark pic.twitter.com/0useA04xgy \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (@chefjoseandres) October 26, 2019\n\nTrump and the chef have feuded for years following Andr\u00e9s's decision to cancel his planned restaurant in the president's D.C. hotel over Trump's rhetoric about Mexican immigrants when announcing his White House bid in 2015.\n\nThe Trump Organization settled a legal battle with the chef over the scrapped restaurant plans in 2017.", "description": "Celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s is slated to throw the first pitch at\u00a0Game 5 of the World Series between the\u00a0Washington Nationals and Houston Astros\u00a0on Sunday night after the Houston Astros defeated the Nationals on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/natsgame3_102619getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
