But critics say they miss these important big-picture facts.\n\n1. GRETA THUNBERG, WHO STARTED THE CLIMATE STRIKE, CALLS CLIMATE CHANGE AN \"EXISTENTIAL EMERGENCY\" \u2014 BUT U.N. ESTIMATES ARE LESS ALARMING.\n\nSome climate scientists say the term \"existential emergency,\" meaning the existence of humanity itself is endangered, is scaremongering.\n\n\"Climate strikers and others (including most of the Democratic presidential candidates) refer to climate change as an existential crisis. This is nonsense,\" Judith Curry, a climate scientist and former professor at Georgia Tech, told Fox News.\n\nThe Earth has warmed about 1 degree Fahrenheit since satellite data collection began in 1979.\n\nThe United Nations' average models forecast a further rise of between 2 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100.\n\nFIVE MOST OVER-THE-TOP CLIMATE WARNINGS\n\nCurry says the high end of the U.N.\u2019s estimates are \u201cbased on implausible scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\n\nBut others say \"climate strikers\" are right to fear.\n\n\u201cThe reason that the forecast temperature rise is an existential crisis for many species on Earth is that it is happening so fast,\u201d Alasdair Skelton, Professor of Geochemistry at Stockholm University, told Fox News.\n\n\u201cSpecies, including ourselves, are unlikely to be able to adapt at the pace of ongoing human-induced climate change,\u201d he added.\n\nEconomists, however, say humans will adapt.\n\nA 2018 study by economist Richard Tol in the journal Review of Environmental Economics and Policy found that climate change \"will likely have a limited impact on the economy and human welfare in the 21st century.\"\n\n\u201cClimate activists take a dim view of human ingenuity,\u201d Tol told Fox News regarding past failed environmental doom stories.\n\n2. \u201cEMISSIONS-FREE\u201d BOAT TRIP POLLUTED MORE THAN AIR TRAVEL.\n\nGreta Thunberg took an \u201cemissions-free\u201d boat from Europe to the U.S. \u2014 but her sea voyage actually spewed more carbon emissions than flying would have.\n\nThat was first reported by left-leaning German news outlet TAZ, which interviewed a spokesman for the boat operators and found that the boat trip required at least six flights \u2014 more than if she had simply flown to the U.S. and back.\n\nCritics say it shows that Thunberg's trip is not really about reducing carbon.\n\n\"It's nothing more than virtue signaling,\" said Marc Morano, publisher of Climate Depot, a website that's skeptical about the impact of climate change.\n\n10 TIMES 'EXPERTS' PREDICTED THE WORLD WOULD END BY NOW\n\n\"Greta took this carbon-fiber, very expensive yacht... The media is completely whitewashing this,\" he added.\n\nBut others defend the trip for raising awareness.\n\n\"I think that Greta is showing a point how difficult it is to go fossil free as an individual without changing the system. That is why it is so important to change the system,\" Ingmar Rentzhog, the founder of \"We Don't Have Time\" and the man who first publicized Thunberg's climate strike, told Fox News. Rentzhog noted that he didn't speak for Thunberg.\n\n3. SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SUPPORT THE \"CLIMATE STRIKE.\"\n\nThe San Diego Unified School Board unanimously resolved that the board is \"proud of students\u2019 leadership in calling for aggressive climate action.\"\n\nThe board also pushed teachers to \u201csupport student Global Climate Walkout events.\u201d\n\n\u201cSchools should not be political tools,\u201d Anthony Watts, who runs the skeptical climate site WattsUpWithThat.com, told Fox News.\n\n\u201cAs a former school board member, I'm concerned that enabling this sort of behavior... will encourage... school protests on a variety of topics.\u201d\n\nERROR IN MAJOR CLIMATE STUDY REVEALED \u2013 WARMING NOT HIGHER THAN EXPECTED\n\nSome major cities, including New York City and Boston, have announced that kids are allowed to skip school for the climate strike if they have a note from their parent.\n\nOthers, including Chicago, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, have not granted blanket amnesty for class-skipping students.\n\n4. THE \u2018CLIMATE STRIKE\u2019 WEBSITE ATTACKS ALL FOSSIL FUELS, EVEN THOSE THAT HELP REDUCE EMISSIONS.\n\nThe International Climate Strike website states: \"People everywhere are at risk if we let oil, coal and gas companies continue to pour more fuel on the fire.\" It demands \"100% renewable energy access for all\" to happen \"swiftly.\"\n\nSkleton defends that, noting, \u201cburning natural gas puts carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which causes global warming.\u201d\n\nOthers say that misses the mark, noting that in the United States, greenhouse gas emissions fell over the last ten years thanks to increased production of relatively-clean natural gas.\n\nCATASTROPHIC GLOBAL WARMING LESS LIKELY, STUDY SAYS\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is doing better than most European countries at reducing emissions, and it's because of tech advances in fracking and natural gas \u2014 which activists are just ideologically opposed to,\u201d Morano said.\n\n\"The strategy for only using renewables in the near term is a fantasy,\" Curry said, adding that nuclear power is the only feasible option for such a switch \u2014 but it is not trendy.\n\n5. THUNBERG'S STRIKE WAS PARTLY BUILT UP BY ACTIVISTS.\n\nMany media outlets cover the climate strike and Greta Thunberg uncritically. A Vice article described her as \u201cthe girl who changed the world\u201d and \u201cthe voice of a generation\u201d who spontaneously started the climate strike.\n\nBut critics say that her strike was timed within weeks of a book release by her mother about activism, and the climate strike idea was proposed to her by climate activist Bo Thor\u00e9n.\n\nWhen Thunberg decided to do it, Thor\u00e9n told another activist, Ingmar Rentzhog, who photographed her one-girl strike and used his \"We Don't Have Time\" organization to spread the word.\n\n\u201cThis is no secret,\u201d Rentzhog told Fox News of the tip-off, adding that rumors he knew Thunberg\u2019s parents were false.\n\nAL GORE WOULD HAVE LOST GLOBAL WARMING BET, ACADEMIC SAYS\n\n\u201cIdeas mean nothing if not that someone is willing to make a reality of them,\u201d Rentzhog added in defense of Thunberg. \u201cAnd Greta... has a great talent to express herself in a very clear and direct way about the problem.\u201d\n\nBut critics say the \"climate strike\" is a sad testament to activists' successful efforts to scare kids.\n\n\u201cPolling data shows kids are fearful about climate, coming into school with anxiety \u2013 even when the U.N. models don\u2019t justify that fear,\u201d Morano said.\n\nMaxim Lott is Executive Producer of Stossel TV and creator of ElectionBettingOdds.com.
