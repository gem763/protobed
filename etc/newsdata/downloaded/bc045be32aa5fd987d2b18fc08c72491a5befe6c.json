It saw inflation averaging 1.7% this year and 1.5% in 2020.\n\nThe forecasts are much gloomier than the central bank's.\n\nIn early September, the Riksbank repeated its forecast of a rate hike late this year or early next and rate-setters have mainly stuck to that view since.\n\nBut most analysts believe the central bank will be forced to change its mind.\n\nThe economy barely grew in the first half of the year, inflation has slipped, unemployment is up - hitting consumer sentiment - and recent PMI figures show both the manufacturing and services sectors contracting.\n\nProduction figures for August were decent, giving the Riksbank some hope, but a survey on Wednesday showed inflation expectations diverging further from the 2% target.\n\n\"The bank can ignore temporary swings in inflation as long as expectations are anchored at the target, and the downward trend is thus a concern for the Riksbank, supporting our view of a rate cut around the turn of the year,\" Nordea economist Torbjorn Isaksson said.\n\nInflation figures for September are due on Thursday with analysts in a Reuters poll expecting a further decline to 1.2% from 1.3% the previous month. The Riksbank expects underlying inflation of 1.3%.\n\nDisappointing numbers could be enough to scupper the Riksbank's rate-hike plans. Markets are already pricing in a rate cut, but the central bank may not yet be ready to move that far, even if it does push back its rate-hike forecast when it announces its next policy decision on Oct. 24.\n\nGRAPHIC: Sweden economy: http://tmsnrt.rs/2bylYpf GRAPHIC: Riksbank rate, inflation and the Krona: http://tmsnrt.rs/1qEN4Rz\n\n(Reporting by Simon Johnson; Editing by Johan Ahlander and Alison Williams)", "description": "STOCKHOLM, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Sweden's economy is slowing and  the central bank will be forced to keep the benchmark interest  rate at the current level of...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
