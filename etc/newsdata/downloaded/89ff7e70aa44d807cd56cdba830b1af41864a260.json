No significant legislation has passed Congress, and indeed it has become painfully clear that this White House has no real sense of what legislation it would even like to pass. There has been no political honeymoon: For this stage of an administration, Trump is the most unpopular president of modern times. Important areas of the executive branch are barely staffed or functioning, the White House is in a state of low-grade civil war, and the bungling, pratfalls, conflicts of interest, weak attempts at propaganda and brazen lying are all, well, not normal, as the self-styled \u201cresistance\u201d likes to say.\n\nBut it could be worse. Really, it could. Let me count the ways.\n\nFirst, the economy is still O.K., still creating jobs and growing. Before Trump\u2019s election there were good reasons \u2014 in market data, not just media conventional wisdom \u2014 to expect that his ascent to the presidency would drag the stock market downward, and tug the job market down with it. The fact that this hasn\u2019t happened, that instead the Obama-era expansion has continued, means that the Trump administration has thus far cleared one (admittedly low) bar, and achieved a level of semi-competence that persuades investors to invest and consumers to keep spending and businesses to hire. That\u2019s a good thing, it was not guaranteed, and we should hope it lasts.\n\nSecond, the administration has failed to push through Paul Ryan\u2019s Obamacare replacement. Sure, this isn\u2019t good news for Trump on the usual presidential metrics, where big legislation counts as promises kept, points on the board, the building blocks of a legacy and so forth. But it is good news for the country, because the proposed Obamacare replacement was so flawed that its passage would have achieved little or nothing for the common good. And it\u2019s quite possible to imagine that pattern repeating itself going forward: Good right-of-center legislation under Trump may be a pipe dream, but better no legislation at all than bad legislation, and with a Republican Party that\u2019s both internally divided and incompetent at policy making, Trump\u2019s inability to close the deal could save the country from a great many lousy bills.\n\nThird, Trump\u2019s personnel choices have improved. For a time it looked as if his administration would have some reasonably competent people in its cabinet but that the White House itself, the zone of crucial decision making, would be reserved for cranks and cronies. But since the swift departure of Michael Flynn from the National Security Council, Trump\u2019s immediate circle of advisers has, well, normalized to a certain extent.", "description": "Passing judgment on Trump\u2019s first 100 days.", "authors": ["Ross Douthat"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/26/opinion/26douthatWeb/26douthatWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2017-04-26"}
