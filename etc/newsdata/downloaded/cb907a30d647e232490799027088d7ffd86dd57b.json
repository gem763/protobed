In fact, I am aware of one particular former Premier League official who asked not to be given games that involved his favourite team.\n\nThere are two things I see wrong with this approach.\n\nFirstly, the referee should not have divulged that he was a fan or supporter of this team.\n\nSecondly, as a referee, you have to be able to keep your personal preferences to yourself and carry out your duties in a fair and unbiased way. If you can\u2019t do that, you should not be a referee. You should take up some other form of sport that won\u2019t cloud your judgement.\n\nReferees are the guardians of the beautiful game. They have to be seen to be above reproach and not only be completely neutral in their decision-making, but be seen to be neutral. With the advent of high-speed transmissions and the video assistant referee (VAR) system, there is no place to hide.\n\nEvery move is scrutinised in its minutest detail, even to the extent that a player can be ruled offside by millimetres. Goals can also be disallowed using the same process.\n\nHow many times have we seen this play out so far? And the season is only a couple of months old.\n\nOf course, not every country has the VAR, but is the VAR really necessary? The TV cameras are there and the technology is available.\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem with having a qualified referee in the outside broadcast van making a decision?\n\nThe refs are \u201cmiced\u201d up, so it would, or should, only take a few seconds to come to a decision.\n\nIs this not the answer? If so, why isn\u2019t it being implemented?\n\nI guess the jury is still out on that one, but it seems like a solution from my point of view.\n\nHappy whistling!", "description": "The loose definition of refereeing is that, as a match official, you are there to arbitrate between two competing teams that both want to win.", "authors": ["Errol Sweeney"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8666/3931d155e4564b01bb136eb76d0898c3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
