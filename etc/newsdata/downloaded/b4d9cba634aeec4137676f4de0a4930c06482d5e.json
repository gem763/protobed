In this recipe, you could use chicken thighs, but drumsticks make this dish super family-friendly. Of course, if you have a crowd that doesn\u2019t love the classic feta-dill pairing, feel free to change the toppings. Mint or parsley work just as well for the herbs, and any salty, crumbly cheese is lovely here. You can dress this up as you like with cucumbers or cherry tomatoes, or green olives, served alongside or pitted, chopped and tossed in instead. Besides the obvious perk of its being a one-pot dinner, this recipe yields great leftovers. For the next day\u2019s lunch, pull any remaining chicken off the bone, chop it, skin and all, and toss with the remaining orzo, vegetables and cheese. Know that the orzo \u2014 a very small pasta, not rice \u2014 soaks up all the liquid and flavor as it sits and cools, so you may need a drizzle of oil and lemon juice over the top to serve it the second day.", "description": "Chicken and orzo is timeless combination, simple and satisfying In this recipe, you could use chicken thighs, but drumsticks make this dish super family-friendly Of course, if you have a crowd that doesn\u2019t love the classic feta-dill pairing, feel free to change the toppings", "authors": ["Sarah Copeland", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Kay Chun", "Molly O'Neill", "Pierre Franey", "Marian Burros", "Tejal Rao", "Lidey Heuck", "Nigella Lawson", "Sam Sifton"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/07/dining/sc-chicken-orzo-horizontal/merlin_143416791_00faf07e-cb79-438b-a14c-812ad8df907a-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
