This is our new battleground | Edward Snowden", "language": "en", "text": "In every country of the world, the security of computers keeps the lights on, the shelves stocked, the dams closed, and transportation running. For more than half a decade, the vulnerability of our computers and computer networks has been ranked the number one risk in the US Intelligence Community\u2019s Worldwide Threat Assessment \u2013 that\u2019s higher than terrorism, higher than war. Your bank balance, the local hospital\u2019s equipment, and the 2020 US presidential election, among many, many other things, all depend on computer safety.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of the greatest computer security crisis in history, the US government, along with the governments of the UK and Australia, is attempting to undermine the only method that currently exists for reliably protecting the world\u2019s information: encryption. Should they succeed in their quest to undermine encryption, our public infrastructure and private lives will be rendered permanently unsafe.\n\nIn the simplest terms, encryption is a method of protecting information, the primary way to keep digital communications safe. Every email you write, every keyword you type into a search box \u2013 every embarrassing thing you do online \u2013 is transmitted across an increasingly hostile internet. Earlier this month the US, alongside the UK and Australia, called on Facebook to create a \u201cbackdoor\u201d, or fatal flaw, into its encrypted messaging apps, which would allow anyone with the key to that backdoor unlimited access to private communications. So far, Facebook has resisted this.\n\n'We are hurtling towards a surveillance state\u2019: the rise of facial recognition technology Read more\n\nIf internet traffic is unencrypted, any government, company, or criminal that happens to notice it can \u2013 and, in fact, does \u2013 steal a copy of it, secretly recording your information for ever. If, however, you encrypt this traffic, your information cannot be read: only those who have a special decryption key can unlock it.\n\nI know a little about this, because for a time I operated part of the US National Security Agency\u2019s global system of mass surveillance. In June 2013 I worked with journalists to reveal that system to a scandalised world. Without encryption I could not have written the story of how it all happened \u2013 my book Permanent Record \u2013 and got the manuscript safely across borders that I myself can\u2019t cross. More importantly, encryption helps everyone from reporters, dissidents, activists, NGO workers and whistleblowers, to doctors, lawyers and politicians, to do their work \u2013 not just in the world\u2019s most dangerous and repressive countries, but in every single country.\n\nWhen I came forward in 2013, the US government wasn\u2019t just passively surveilling internet traffic as it crossed the network, but had also found ways to co-opt and, at times, infiltrate the internal networks of major American tech companies. At the time, only a small fraction of web traffic was encrypted: six years later, Facebook, Google and Apple have made encryption-by-default a central part of their products, with the result that today close to 80% of web traffic is encrypted. Even the former director of US national intelligence, James Clapper, credits the revelation of mass surveillance with significantly advancing the commercial adoption of encryption. The internet is more secure as a result. Too secure, in the opinion of some governments.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s attorney general, William Barr, who authorised one of the earliest mass surveillance programmes without reviewing whether it was legal, is now signalling an intention to halt \u2013 or even roll back \u2013 the progress of the last six years. WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, already uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE): in March the company announced its intention to incorporate E2EE into its other messaging apps \u2013 Facebook Messenger and Instagram \u2013 as well. Now Barr is launching a public campaign to prevent Facebook from climbing this next rung on the ladder of digital security. This began with an open letter co-signed by Barr, UK home secretary Priti Patel, Australia\u2019s minister for home affairs and the US secretary of homeland security, demanding Facebook abandon its encryption proposals.\n\nIf Barr\u2019s campaign is successful, the communications of billions will remain frozen in a state of permanent insecurity: users will be vulnerable by design. And those communications will be vulnerable not only to investigators in the US, UK and Australia, but also to the intelligence agencies of China, Russia and Saudi Arabia \u2013 not to mention hackers around the world.\n\nEnd-to-end encrypted communication systems are designed so that messages can be read only by the sender and their intended recipients, even if the encrypted \u2013 meaning locked \u2013 messages themselves are stored by an untrusted third party, for example, a social media company such as Facebook.\n\nThe central improvement E2EE provides over older security systems is in ensuring the keys that unlock any given message are only ever stored on the specific devices at the end-points of a communication \u2013 for example the phones of the sender or receiver of the message \u2013 rather than the middlemen who own the various internet platforms enabling it. Since E2EE keys aren\u2019t held by these intermediary service providers, they can no longer be stolen in the event of the massive corporate data breaches that are so common today, providing an essential security benefit. In short, E2EE enables companies such as Facebook, Google or Apple to protect their users from their scrutiny: by ensuring they no longer hold the keys to our most private conversations, these corporations become less of an all-seeing eye than a blindfolded courier.\n\nIt is striking that when a company as potentially dangerous as Facebook appears to be at least publicly willing to implement technology that makes users safer by limiting its own power, it is the US government that cries foul. This is because the government would suddenly become less able to treat Facebook as a convenient trove of private lives.\n\nTo justify its opposition to encryption, the US government has, as is traditional, invoked the spectre of the web\u2019s darkest forces. Without total access to the complete history of every person\u2019s activity on Facebook, the government claims it would be unable to investigate terrorists, drug dealers money launderers and the perpetrators of child abuse \u2013 bad actors who, in reality, prefer not to plan their crimes on public platforms, especially not on US-based ones that employ some of the most sophisticated automatic filters and reporting methods available.\n\nContact the Guardian securely Read more\n\nThe true explanation for why the US, UK and Australian governments want to do away with end-to-end encryption is less about public safety than it is about power: E2EE gives control to individuals and the devices they use to send, receive and encrypt communications, not to the companies and carriers that route them. This, then, would require government surveillance to become more targeted and methodical, rather than indiscriminate and universal.\n\nWhat this shift jeopardises is strictly nations\u2019 ability to spy on populations at mass scale, at least in a manner that requires little more than paperwork. By limiting the amount of personal records and intensely private communications held by companies, governments are returning to classic methods of investigation that are both effective and rights-respecting, in lieu of total surveillance. In this outcome we remain not only safe, but free.\n\n\u2022 Edward Snowden is former CIA officer and whistleblower, and author of Permanent Record.
