Some of those plans are expensive. With Warren emerging as a front-runner in the Democratic presidential contest, Yahoo Finance tallied the cost of her plans.\n\nAltogether, the Massachusetts senator\u2019s agenda would require $4.2 trillion per year in new federal spending, and a like amount in new taxes, if she paid for everything without issuing new debt. The federal government currently spends about $4.4 trillion per year, so Warren\u2019s plans would nearly double federal spending.\n\nThe Treasury takes in about $3.4 trillion in tax revenue each year, so if Warren levied new taxes to pay for everything, federal taxation would rise by 124%. She could pay for some of her plans by issuing new debt instead of raising taxes, but with annual deficits close to $1 trillion already, that might be unwise.\n\nThe biggest chunk of new spending in Warren\u2019s agenda, by far, would be Medicare for all, the single-payer health plan she would impose to replace all private insurance. Warren explains how she would pay for all of her plans\u2014except this one. With fellow Democratic candidates pressing her for details, Warren says she\u2019ll provide financing options for Medicare for all soon.\n\nA single-payer plan covering every American would cost about $3.4 trillion per year, according to the Urban Institute and other analysts. Again: that\u2019s equal to all federal tax revenue in 2019. Warren says \u201ccosts\u201d would go down for middle-class families under Medicare for all, because all care would be free and families would end up paying less in new taxes than they now pay for health care. But that doesn\u2019t mean Americans would be comfortable with the tradeoffs.\n\nGraphic by David Foster More\n\nAnalysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget finds that \u201cit is clear that taxes on the middle class would have to rise\u201d to cover the cost of Medicare for all. That could still be a bargain for some people, but an effort to pass a single-payer health plan in Vermont failed in 2014 because the new tax burden would have been too severe on businesses and families. And under any scenario, transitioning to Medicare for all would be turbulent. \u201cThere would be massive disruption in terms of winners and losers,\u201d says Kenneth Thorpe, chairman of the health policy department at Emory University.\n\nWarren would pay for most of her other plans with taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans. Her \u201cultra-millionaire tax,\u201d for instance, would be a 2% annual fee on wealth of $50 million or more, with an additional 1% fee on wealth above $1 billion. She says that would raise about $275 billion per year. She\u2019d use that money to cancel a majority of student debt, cover college costs for students from lower-income families, pay for universal child care and make other reforms to public schools.\n\nWarren\u2019s \u201creal corporate profits tax\u201d would be a 7% surtax on profit above $100 million at all big companies. This is meant to squeeze some tax revenue out of companies that otherwise use tax credits and loopholes to push their tax liability close to 0, even when they report handsome profits to shareholders. Warren says this would raise $100 billion per year, which she\u2019d use to fund a transition to green manufacturing. But she wants to spend twice as much on this transition, leaving part of her green agenda unfunded.", "description": "All told, her plans would require a 124% hike in federal tax revenue.", "authors": ["Rick Newman", "Senior Columnist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2rcIJNjINwqQeUwAtHAleA--~B/aD0xNDQwO3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/a9b45230-f67e-11e9-b7ff-70e70507afc0", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
