For the first time in memory, a consensus of U.S. law enforcement officials agree that white supremacist domestic terrorism has become the No. 1 terrorist threat facing the United States. The question now is, what is to be done?\n\nI recently attended a conference hosted by the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security, entitled \u201cDomestic Terrorism and Its Global Context: Exploring the USG Approach\u201d\u2014an invitation-only gathering of government officials, civil society activists and academics concerned with the threat. The meeting was convened specifically to make suggestions for U.S. government action.\n\nI have been studying the radical right for almost 25 years now, and it\u2019s difficult enough to come up with anything approaching a \u201csolution\u201d for private groups or individuals, let alone laws or police actions that must and should be carried out by a government that respects civil liberties in a free society.
