Gov. Tate Reeves and while the men remained civil, they drew clear lines for voters.\n\nIronically, Mr. Hood is attempting to flip the script in the Magnolia State, saying he plans to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d the Republican majority that controls the Jackson legislature represents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to pay for it by draining the swamp that Tate Reeves has created,\u201d Mr. Hood declared at the outset, using President Trump\u2019s famous campaign slogan.\n\n\u201cThere one candidate running for governor who is a conservative and one candidate who is a liberal, and I want to give Mississippi voters the chance to vote for the conservative Republican,\u201d Mr. Reeves responded.\n\nThe contrast did fall along those traditional lines.\n\nFor example, Mr. Reeves came out against universal background checks on firearms purchases, while Mr. Hood favored them. And when it came to the Mississippi state flag \u2014 the last that continues to include a Confederate symbol \u2014 Mr. Hood said it was unfortunate while Mr. Reeves said any change should come from a statewide vote, not a capitol lawmaker.\n\nThe men traded barbs on ethics, with Mr. Hood saying emails indicated it was Mr. Reeves\u2019 office who got taxpayer money spent on an access road from his neighborhood to a shopping center, while Mr. Reeves quoted a Wall Street Journal editorial that called Mr. Hood\u2019s trial lawyer money men \u201csleazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the Wall Street Journal is owned by robber barons,\u201d Mr. Hood scoffed, in another throwback phrase.\n\nTraditional political topics were also debated. For instance, both men agreed Mississippi\u2019s roads are in poor shape and the state\u2019s teachers underpaid. But just how teacher salaries should be brought in line with Southern averages and the roads improved was a bit more opaque.\n\nMr. Reeves, insisting he would not make promises he couldn\u2019t keep, said the state\u2019s booming economy has made it possible to phase in teacher raises over four years, while Mr. Hood, using the story of a teacher who supports him, said the raises should be immediate.\n\nBut when Mr. Hood suggested the money for some of his plans, such as those for roads and bridges, could all come from the money he would save by \u201cdraining the swamp,\u201d Mr. Reeves called it a dodge.\n\n\u201cThe first thing he\u2019s going to do as governor is raise the gas tax on hard working Mississippians,\u201d Mr. Reeves said.\n\nEven the strong economy could be chalked up to different sources, according to the candidates. Mr. Reeves attributed it to tax and regulatory cuts that have improved the business climate, driving down unemployment and putting more money in consumer wallets.\n\nMr. Hood, on the other hand, said he deserved credit for bringing in more money by instituting an internet sales tax collection measure.\n\nThe debate at the University of Southern Mississippi unfolded before what appeared to be a split crowd, with supporters sometimes cheering each candidate. A second debate is slated for next week in Columbus.\n\nHours before the men took the stage, the campaigns released their quarterly finance reports that showed Mr. Reeves with $2 million cash on hand and Mr. Hood with $1.3 million for the race\u2019s final weeks.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
