Arsenal winter transfer targets 1/10 Arsenal winter transfer targets Josh Kroenke has promised Arsenal plan to be \u2018proactive\u2019 in the winter transfer market. But who could they sign? Getty 2/10 Wilfried Zaha Arsenal have not completely given up on prizing Wilfried Zaha away from Crystal Palace. He won't come cheap ... but for the right price Palace may be tempted to cash in, particularly if the 26-year-old fails to impress in the first half of the season. Getty Images 3/10 Eduardo Camavinga The 16-year-old - who enjoyed a breakthrough performance against PSG in Ligue 1 last weekend - is also a target for Manchester United, City and Tottenham. Arsenal could attempt to replicate their William Saliba deal with Saint-\u00c9tienne by signing Camavinga and then immediately loaning him back to current club, Rennes. AFP/Getty Images 4/10 Dayot Upamecano If Josh Kroenke is true to his word, and his family do back the club in the winter market, than 20-year-old defender Dayot Upamecano is surely the first player they will attempt to sign. Arsenal came close to landing him this summer, only to balk at Leipzig's \u00a355m price tag having so recently spent a club-record \u00a372m on Nicolas Pepe. Bongarts/Getty Images 5/10 Samuel Umtiti Arsenal will monitor the first half of the 25-year-old's season at Barcelona very closely. The defender's 2018/19 season was hampered by injury and Unai Emery has gone on record about how much he rates the World Cup winner. Icon Sport via Getty Images 6/10 Daniele Rugani Juventus are desperate to get rid of the defender as they scramble to balance the books ahead of this week's Italian transfer deadline. If they fail to offload Rugani he will certainly be available in the winter, and could make a good cut-price solution if Arsenal do indeed manage to sell Shkodran Mustafi this month. AFP/Getty Images 7/10 Robert Arboleda Arsenal came very close to signing the Ecuador international Robert Arboleda from S\u00e3o Paulo on transfer deadline day, instead snapping up David Luiz. But if they are short in defence in five months time, the 27-year-old would make a sensible purchase, especially considering his club were willing to sell. AFP/Getty Images 8/10 Fagner Conserva Another South American defender that Arsenal have preciously explored signing, that they could move for if necessary in January. Plays for Edu's former club Corinthians, which would help speed up any deal. AP 9/10 Everton Arsenal seriously explored signing the 23-year-old Brazil international this summer, but were deterred by his rapidly escalating price tag. But if they are backed by Josh Kroenke this winter, could they return for the Gr\u00eamio star? A move to Europe surely beckons for the electric forward, who won the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica top scorer award this summer. REUTERS 10/10 Toby Alderweireld The Spurs defender will be available to negotiate a free transfer to another club from January. Could Arsenal snap him up? It's happened once before...

Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt was just a case of writing names down and then giving them to the manager and he will go through them - obviously with his input - and we'll see what happens.\n\n\u201cI have no idea [when an announcement will be made], but there is a lot of leaders in that team who are helping each other out and pushing each other on.\n\n\u201cNow that we've got these five captains that the manager has brought in it's spreading the leadership group rather than having one person to dictate it. You're getting more input, it's generating a good environment.\u201d\n\nHolding has backed Xhaka\u2019s captaincy, though, despite criticism of the Swiss international\u2019s performances of late from supporters.\n\n\u201cI love Granit in the changing room,\u201d Holding added. \u201cI think he is great. He is really switched on to people being late, people using the phones. He is quick to dish out the fines.\n\n\u201cI think he is a great leader and just another positive person to have in the changing room.\n\n\u201cHe is very demanding and makes demands of us. He puts accountability on ourselves, which is important as a leader.\u201d\n\nThe 24-year-old, who made his first appearance of the season in Tuesday night\u2019s 5-0 Carabao Cup win over Nottingham Forest, is also open to the possibility of taking the armband himself.\n\n\u201cI would love to be a captain and being captain of Arsenal is unbelievable. It would be a great feeling,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will see what happens in the next couple of weeks. If I get it, then I'll be more than happy and honoured to do it.\u201d", "description": "Arsenal defender Rob Holding has revealed that manager Unai Emery asked the club\u2019s players to vote for their choice of captain.
