He's searching for Felipe Anderson but over hits his pass and the ball goes out for a Man Utd throw in. That's been the story of the match so far, good ideas from both teams but poor execution. West Ham 0 - 0 Man Utd 9 mins: Ashley Young plays a quick ball through the defence that Rashford chases, he catches up with the ball just before it goes out of play and the whistle goes for offside.

Advertisement KICK OFF West Ham 0 - 0 Man Utd Kick off: Manchester United kick off the game and Mata sends the ball forward for Rashford who is beaten in the air by Diop and the ball comes back into the midfield for the visitors to pick up. Both teams exit the tunnel and make their way out on to the pitch. West Ham vs Man Utd is next... Less than 10 minutes until kick off at the London Stadium. History tells us Manchester United should ease to victory but Manuel Pellegrini believes his side's recent form is enough to challenge the Red Devils. I agree but I think Man Utd will take confidence out of their last two games and will bring this one home 2-1. What do you think? West Ham United's 0-0 draw on Monday against Aston Villa felt more like a win for the Hammers as they hung on for a draw with 10-men. Following that momentum and the victories earlier in the season, Manuel Pellegrini thinks that more of the same will trouble Manchester United, he said: \"Manchester United played on Thursday night [in the Europa League] but they changed nine players so it will be a different team. \"We are in a good moment so, if we are playing against the big teams, we must show we can play in the same way.\" Advertisement It's a landmark day for West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini as he takes charge of the Hammers for the 50th time today: The result at the London stadium today will be crucial for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Manchester United are winless in six away league games, drawing three and losing three, it's just one short of their Premier League record. They have not kept an away league clean sheet since a 3-0 win at Fulham in February and they have only scored more than once in one of their last 10 league games. The news on Mason Greenwood's omission from the Manchester United squad is that he has tonsillitis. It's a disappointment for the youngster who was surely considered for a start in today's match following his match winning performance in the Europa League on Thursday. Head-to-head West Ham have won two of their last four home league games versus Manchester United, as many as they had in their previous 19 home matches against them. But Manchester United have scored more Premier League goals against West Ham than any other side with 94. Man Utd have lost only two of the past 21 league meetings between the two sides and they have failed to score in just two of those matches.

Aaron Cresswell replaces the suspended Arthur Masuaku at left-back, while summer signing Pablo Fornals comes in for the injured Manuel Lanzini. Nemanja Matic and Marcus Rashford are the only two players to remain from Manchester United's starting XI in the midweek Europa League game with Astana. Mason Greenwood, United's match winner on Thursday, is not included in the squad, but Daniel James starts after recovering from a back problem. Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial, Luke Shaw and Eric Bailly all remain sidelined by injuries. BREAKING NEWS Team news - Man Utd BREAKING NEWS Team news - West Ham Advertisement Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer knows the task ahead of his team today will not be easy and has explained how a solid defence is the key to winning the game. He said: \"Last time [April's 2-1 home win over West Ham] we were lucky to beat them and it will be a good test. But we have had two clean sheets in a row now and that will give the defenders confidence. \"If we can keep a clean sheet it will be easier for our strikers, who will know we don't have to score twos, threes and fours all the time.\" Early team news For West Ham, Arthur Masuaku is banned after his sending off against Aston Villa and Manuel Lanzini faces a fitness test. Michail Antonio and Winston Reid also remain out with long term injuries. Daniel James suffered a back injury against Leicester last week and Manchester United are hopeful he has overcome it and can play today. Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial are both unlikely to be fit, while Luke Shaw and Eric Bailly remain sidelined by injuries. This is a big game for both sides. They both have eight points in the Premier League this season and a win for either would move them into the top four. Manchester United have managed back-to-back clean sheets in all competitions and managed to hold on to a 1-0 lead against Leicester last time out. For West Ham they have been undergone a resurgence under Manuel Pellegrini and will see this young Manchester United team as there for the taking.
