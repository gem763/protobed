Ballooning capital needs can propel biotechs to either go public or sell themselves before they're even selling a single drug.\n\nThe Jefferies team's predictions are rooted in what happened in 2017, when private financings gave momentum to a wave of IPOs in 2018 and 2019.

The market has also been strong for biotech companies since the sequencing of the human genome in the early 2000s, and especially since the passage of the landmark healthcare law the Affordable Care Act in 2010, they said.\n\nWell-funded VCs are betting heavily on biotechs based on factors like management teams and innovative ideas, but they're also underestimating how much risk is in the mix, Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten told Business Insider.\n\n\"I have seen this trend before and it ends poorly,\" he said.\n\nThe Jefferies analysis, which was released in mid-August, took a look at the top 30 fundraising rounds between May 2017 and August 2019. Since it was posted, two of the companies it tapped have said that they plan to go public.\n\nRead on to for more about the biotechs that made the cut.", "description": "Since an analysis from Jefferies was released last month, two of the companies it tapped have said that they plan to go public.", "authors": ["Emma Court", "Clarrie Feinstein"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d54212dcd97843e7f131a8a-2732-1366.jpg"}
