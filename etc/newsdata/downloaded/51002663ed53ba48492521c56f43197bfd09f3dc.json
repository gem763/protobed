The Council on American-Islamic Relations sued in 2016 on behalf of Muslim Americans who say they were wrongly placed on the FBI's watch list and suffered negative consequences as a result. (Alex Brandon, File)\n\nA federal judge ruled Wednesday that an FBI watch list of more than 1 million \u201cknown or suspected terrorists\u201d violates the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens in the database.\n\nThe decision from U.S. District Judge Anthony J. Trenga of the Eastern District of Virginia in favor of 23 Muslim Americans who sued over their inclusion the Terrorist Screening Database found that the watch list infringes on their constitutional right to due process. Trenga noted that the list restricts their ability to fly and engage in everyday activities and backed the plaintiffs\u2019 concerns that they were flagged secretly and without a clear methodology.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence, or contention, that any of these plaintiffs satisfy the definition of a \u2018known terrorist,\u2019\u201d wrote Trenga, adding that even harmless conduct could result in someone being labeled as a \u201csuspected terrorist\u201d on the watch list.\n\n\u201cAn individual\u2019s placement into the [watch list] does not require any evidence that the person engaged in criminal activity, committed a crime, or will commit a crime in the future,\u201d the judge wrote, \u201cand individuals who have been acquitted of a terrorism-related crime may still be listed.\u201d\n\nThe ruling could reshape the government\u2019s process for a watch list that has long been criticized for inaccuracy and described by opponents as \u201ca Muslim registry created in the wake of the widespread Islamophobia of the early 2000s.\u201d Trenga ordered both the plaintiffs and defendants to submit arguments about how to fix the constitutional problems with the database, which encompasses nearly 1.2 million people, including about 4,600 U.S. citizens or residents, as of June 2017.\n\nTrenga\u2019s 32-page opinion was hailed as a significant win by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the civil-liberties organization that filed the lawsuit in 2016.\n\n\u201cInnocent people should be beyond the reach of the watchlist system,\u201d Gadeir Abbas, a CAIR attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. \u201cWe think that\u2019s what the Constitution requires.\u201d\n\nThe watch list is a different, less restrictive database than the No Fly List, which bars people from boarding U.S. airplanes or flying through the nation\u2019s airspace. In 2014, a federal judge in Oregon ruled the No Fly List was unconstitutional, forcing the Department of Homeland Security to reform its procedures. Abbas told the Associated Press that Wednesday\u2019s ruling was the first to specifically target the watch list.\n\nThe FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Wednesday. The AP reported that the FBI\u2019s lawyers argued in court that the government\u2019s efforts to combat terrorism outweighed the difficulties alleged by the nearly two-dozen Muslim American citizens on the list.\n\nBut the Muslim American citizens on the watch list told the court they suffered a wide range of abuse and harassment, according to the opinion.\n\nAnas Elhady was returning to the U.S. after a brief trip to Canada in April 2015 when he was surrounded by Border Patrol before he was handcuffed and interrogated for more than 10 hours. During this time, he needed emergency medical attention. Elhady would be detained at least two other times at the border, and on one occasion an FBI agent told him his cellphone conversations were being monitored, according to the opinion.\n\n\u201cWhen Elhady attempted border-crossings, CBP officers told him, \u2018Are you serious? Someone like you should have stopped crossing the border by now,\u2019\u201d wrote Trenga, a 2008 appointee of President George W. Bush.\n\nHassan Shibly, a plaintiff who works in CAIR\u2019s Florida chapter, said he\u2019s been searched dozens of times due to his inclusion in the database. Once he was handcuffed by authorities in front of his grandmother near a border crossing in Detroit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s humiliating,\u201d Shibly told the AP in April. \u201cThe government lawyers could never make the arguments they made ... if they had personally faced the same treatment we\u2019ve faced.\u201d\n\nAnother plaintiff, Hassan Fares, said the secrecy of the watch list had him questioning whether his struggle to open up a bank account stemmed from his placement on the list.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to determine whether it\u2019s random or whether it\u2019s connection to something else,\u201d he said to the AP. \u201cSuspicion just leads to paranoia.\u201d\n\nAbbas also argued that the broadly disseminated database \u2014 which grew from 680,000 people in 2013 to 1.16 million in 2017 \u2014 was worthless in stopping terrorism.\n\nAfter noting that many who have actually committed acts of terrorism never had their names included on the list, Abbas pointed to the case of Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in 2016 at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Though Mateen was on the FBI\u2019s watch list had been interviewed twice by authorities, he was eventually removed from the database in March 2014. James B. Comey, then director of the FBI, said that federal agents had concluded he was not a threat, The Washington Post reported.\n\nIn his ruling, Trenga gave the parties in the lawsuit 45 days total to submit their arguments and replies for how the watch list could be reformed.", "description": "The Wednesday ruling has the chance to help shape the federal government\u2019s process for a watch list that\u2019s been described by opponents as \u201ca Muslim registry created in the wake of the widespread Islamophobia of the early 2000s.\u201d", "authors": ["Timothy Bella", "Deputy Editor For Morning Mix", "September At Am", "Timothy Bella Is The Deputy Editor Of Morning Mix.
