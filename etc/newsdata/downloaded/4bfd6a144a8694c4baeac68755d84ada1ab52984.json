Cardinals swept three games in 1982 NLCS and again in 2000 NLDS and won 2012 wild-card game. Braves won 1996 NLCS 4-3. \u2026 Braves have lost nine straight playoff rounds since beating Astros in 2001 NLDS. Only the Chicago Cubs, who lost 10 straight from 1910 through 1998, had a longer streak. \u2026 Braves are without Gold Glove CF Ender Inciarte (strained right hamstring) and utility players Johan Camargo (right shin fracture) and Charlie Culberson (broken facial bones). \u2026 Freeman was 3 for 24 in last eight games while missing some time due to bone spurs in his right elbow. \u2026 Freeman hit .381 with two homers in six games against Cardinals this season. \u2026 Donaldson batted .190 with no homers vs. St. Louis. \u2026 Keuchel has not faced Cardinals since 2016. He has nine career postseason starts. Foltynewicz, with two starts against Dodgers in 2018 NLDS, is only other Atlanta pitcher with more than one postseason start. \u2026 All six games between the clubs this season were played in May. St. Louis went 9-18 overall that month. \u2026 Atlanta finished third in National League in runs. St. Louis ranked 11th. \u2026 Cardinals had second-best ERA (3.82) in NL behind Dodgers. Atlanta was fourth (4.07). \u2026 Cardinals had second-most shutouts (14) in NL this year. \u2026 St. Louis had best fielding percentage in majors. Braves were second among NL teams.\n\n___\n\nBig Picture:\n\nCardinals: Routed the Cubs 9-0 in regular-season finale to win first NL Central title since 2015. Cardinals (91-71) had clinched playoff spot with victory over Cubs on Sept. 21. \u2026 Division crown came in Mike Schildt\u2019s first full season as manager. \u2026 Cardinals were a .500 team at All-Star break before midsummer tear. \u2026 St. Louis needed Flaherty to pitch regular-season finale, so he won\u2019t be available until Game 2 against Braves. The good news for Cardinals? He would be on full rest for Game 5 if needed. Flaherty had a 0.91 ERA after All-Star break, third-lowest in major league history. \u2026 Hudson held Chicago scoreless over five innings last Friday, but walked five in final start of regular season. That gave him most walks in league (86). \u2026 The 38-year-old Wainwright was battered by Chicago in his final regular-season start, allowing four homers and six runs in 4 1/3 innings. \u2026 Wong strained his left hamstring running out a grounder Sept. 19 at Wrigley Field. He hopes to be ready for Division Series, but Edman would replace him in lineup if Wong is unable to play. Edman hit .358 in September. \u2026 St. Louis was third in NL rotation ERA and bullpen ERA, making up for its below-average offensive output. \u2026 Cardinals went from last to first in fielding, committing 133 errors last season and just 66 this year. \u2026 St. Louis led league in stolen bases, and was just third team in franchise history with at least 200 homers and 100 steals in same season.\n\nBraves: Atlanta (97-65) finished regular season with its most wins since 2003 and the NL\u2019s No. 2 seed. \u2026 Team didn\u2019t finish strong. With injuries becoming a growing concern, Braves won only eight of last 19 games. \u2026 Keuchel lost his last three starts. \u2026 Acu\u00f1a\u2019s chance for a 40-40 season ended when he was held out late in season due to a left hip injury. \u2026 If Acu\u00f1a is not healthy and with Inciarte already ruled out, Billy Hamilton suddenly becomes a key player for Atlanta after being claimed off waivers from Royals on Aug. 19. Similarly, veteran infielder Adeiny Hechavarr\u00eda will be asked to fill utility void left by injuries to Camargo and Culberson. \u2026 A key to the lineup is Swanson. While other Braves regulars were rested after the team clinched the NL East, Swanson asked for every at-bat as he struggled to find his stroke after missing 30 games with a bruised right foot. Swanson hit only .188 in his last 30 games. \u2026 Soroka had a 1.55 ERA in 15 road starts. His home ERA was 4.14. That\u2019s why the 22-year-old rookie was a good candidate to be held back until Game 3 at St. Louis. But that plan would limit the team\u2019s best Cy Young Award contender to one start in the series.\n\n___\n\nWatch For:\n\n- Injury Updates. Wacha has a right shoulder strain and appears unlikely to pitch in this series. Even if he makes the St. Louis roster, he would be used in a bullpen role. The bigger question is Wong, one of the premier defensive second basemen in the game. He\u2019s been hobbled the past couple of weeks with a strained hamstring, leaving Edman to fill his spot in the lineup. Wong hopes to be ready against Atlanta, but his ability to range deep in the hole could be compromised.\n\n- Overlooked Baby Brave. The 21-year-old Acu\u00f1a has grabbed the headlines while continuing to emerge as one of the game\u2019s top young players. But don\u2019t forget about the 22-year-old Albies, who led the NL with 189 hits while again flashing an impressive combination of power and speed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at the best-of-five National League Division Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Atlanta Braves:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/cubs_cardinals_baseball_35078_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
