People are terrified,\u201d he said.\n\nThere was also fighting in the central province of Ghazni and Laghman province, east of Kabul, Taliban and government officials said. A blast at a football stadium killed the mayor of the northern city of Faizabad while a road-side bomb killed at least eight people, including women and children travelling in a car in northern Balkh province.\n\nAfghan security forces patrol an area during a Taliban attack in the downtown of Kunduz city, Afghanistan August 31, 2019. REUTERS/Stringer\n\nA second road-side bomb in western Farah province killed two women, four children and two policemen, local police officials said.\n\nLocal officials in Faryab province, on the north west border said an air strike killed at least 12 civilians, including eight children but the defence ministry denied the report.\n\nPEACEFUL SOLUTION\n\nWith talks in Doha close to wrapping up, the latest fighting underlined the Taliban\u2019s apparent determination to go into any deal from a position of strength on the battlefield.\n\nKhalilzad gave no details of the deal, which is expected to see thousands of U.S. troops withdrawn from Afghanistan in exchange for guarantees by the Taliban not to allow the country to be used as a base for militant attacks abroad.\n\nSuhail Shaheen, a spokesman for the Taliban\u2019s political office in Doha, said both sides were in discussions to finalise technical issues.\n\n\u201cWe are on the verge of ending the invasion and reaching a peaceful solution for Afghanistan,\u201d Shaheen said on Twitter.\n\nThe agreement would not on its own end the fighting between the Taliban and Afghan security forces, but would allow the start of so-called \u201cintra-Afghan\u201d peace talks, which are expected to be held in the Norwegian capital of Oslo.\n\nHowever it was not clear whether the Taliban would agree to talk directly with the Western-backed government of President Ashraf Ghani, which they consider an illegitimate foreign-imposed regime.\n\nSome Taliban officials have said they would only agree to talk to Afghan officials in a private capacity, not as representatives of the state, and they remain opposed to presidential elections scheduled for Sept. 28.\n\nIt was also unclear whether the agreement would cover the full withdrawal of all 14,500 U.S. troops from Afghanistan or how long a pullout would take.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. envoy for peace in Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad speaks during a debate at Tolo TV channel in Kabul, Afghanistan April 28, 2019.

Thousands of U.S. troops are also engaged in a separate counter-terrorism mission fighting militant groups such as Islamic State and Al Qaeda.\n\nSuicide bombings and combat operations have continued throughout the talks and the fighting in the north underlined the vulnerability of large parts of Afghanistan, where the Taliban control more territory than at any time since being overthrown by a U.S.-led campaign in 2001.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, 3,804 civilians - including more than 900 children - were killed and 7,000 wounded in 2018, the deadliest year for non-combatants in the conflict.", "description": "U.S. and Taliban negotiators are close to a deal that would open the way for peace in Afghanistan, a top U.S. official said on Sunday, as the insurgents followed their weekend assault on the strategic centre of Kunduz by attacking a second northern city.", "authors": ["Abdul Qadir Sediqi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190901&t=2&i=1425105464&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF801FT"}
