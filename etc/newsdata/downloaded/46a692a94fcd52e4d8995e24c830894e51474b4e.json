It\u2019s just that he\u2019s been behaving a little bit oddly.\n\nAfter Boris Johnson announced his Brexit deal on Thursday, an appalled Mr Farage said he\u2019d rather have an extension of Article 50 \u2013 in other words, a delay to Brexit. Then, when Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU would reject an extension, Mr Farage was furious.\n\nBut hang on a minute. If MPs vote down the deal, and the EU rejects an extension, we\u2019ll be leaving on October 31 with a no-deal Brexit.\n\nWhich I thought was what Mr Farage wanted.\n\nThings then grew stranger still, as the Brexit Party leader warned listeners of his LBC radio show that Brexit was only going to get more and more difficult. \u201cAnybody that thinks we\u2019re nearing the final phase of this hasn\u2019t got a clue,\u201d he scowled. \u201cThe Withdrawal Agreement will prove to have been the easy bit.\u201d Which, funnily enough, is exactly what Remainers have been saying.\n\nAnd then it hit me. If Mr Farage doesn\u2019t want to leave with a deal, and doesn\u2019t want the EU to reject an extension, I can see only one explanation.", "description": "Would someone mind checking on Nigel Farage?", "authors": ["Michael Deacon", "Parliamentary Sketchwriter", "Daniel Hannan", "Rebecca Ryan", "Marcus Fysh", "Juliet Samuel", "Charles Moore", "Tom Harris", "Priti Patel", "Barnabas Reynolds"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2019/07/05/TELEMMGLPICT000202782195-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNtm3NAjPW-2_OvjCiS6COCU.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
