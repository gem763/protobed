Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez listens as David Marcus, CEO of Facebooki\u0301s Calibra, testifies to the House Financial Services Committee, July 17, 2019 (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nFernando Cabrera is running to unseat her in next year\u2019s primary in New York.\n\nDemocratic city councilman Fernando Cabrera sounds like a New Yorker. He\u2019s speaking fast when I reach him by phone Monday, rattling off the myriad differences between himself and the woman he\u2019s challenging for the Democratic primary nomination for New York\u2019s 14th district: Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nAs a well-known New York Democrat who is unconcerned about jeopardizing a future career in national politics, Cabrera is the most serious primary challenger to enter the race, and the media have taken notice. His announcement was covered in the New York Post last week, and he was headed to an interview with Fox News as we discuss his plans to upset a political phenom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the cosmetic differences between Cabrera \u2014 a 55-year-old Pentecostal pastor and his 29-year-old former bartender opponent \u2014 abound, he\u2019s convinced that the primary distinction between himself and Ocasio-Cortez is his willingness to do the work of government. He rapidly details his record as a three-term city councilman: falling crime and unemployment rates in his district, coupled with increased graduation rates and high-school STEM achievement. He juxtaposes this record with the way that Ocasio-Cortez has spent her first year in office.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018o\u2019 in Ocasio stands for \u2018zero,\u2019\u201d he says impatiently. \u201cShe has brought home zero money, she\u2019s advanced zero bills.\u201d His frustration is obvious. Cabrera explains that he had no intention of running for the congressional seat. \u201cI would\u2019ve retired,\u201d he says, but then he saw how Ocasio-Cortez derailed Amazon\u2019s plan to bring its headquarters, and 25,000 jobs, to Queens.\n\nCiting her concern for the city\u2019s working class, Ocasio-Cortez joined fellow progressives in Albany to lobby against the tax breaks that the city used to woo the corporate giant. And, having successfully blocked the move, she bizarrely touted the money she helped the city \u201csave\u201d by blocking tax breaks on taxes that will no longer be paid at all. This infuriated Cabrera, who was in talks with city educators to develop special technical high schools that would train students for jobs exactly like those Amazon would have offered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem with Ocasio-Cortez is twofold, in Cabrera\u2019s estimation. She prioritizes broad, attention-grabbing national issues over constituent service, and when she tries to solve problems that are, arguably, far outside her remit as a freshman congresswoman, her commitment is purely rhetorical. Or, as Cabrera puts it, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d\n\nTo illustrate their differences, Cabrera cites their respective approaches to addressing climate change. When hurricanes rocked Puerto Rico last year, Cabrera dropped his life in New York and joined a cleanup crew on the island for three weeks. Ocasio-Cortez, by contrast, has responded to the threat of climate change by using her considerable political capital to introduce the Green New Deal, a resolution that ostensibly is aimed at combating environmental disaster but actually would restructure much of the American economy, bringing it under government control within a decade.\n\n\u201cShe was voted down by her own [Democratic] colleagues, 57 to zero,\u201d when the resolution was put up for a vote in the Senate, Cabrera notes before launching into a diatribe about her refusal to work with more experienced politicians to navigate the machinery of government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile he stresses that he would be focused on local matters if elected, when it comes to addressing massive issues like climate change, he\u2019d get involved to the extent that he could help directly, he explains. He believes that government works best when narrow policy solutions, arrived at through compromise, are applied to specific problems. He\u2019s therefore allergic to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s particular brand of revolutionary politics, which seeks to combine a host of discrete policy issues with a broader socialist framework by which they can all be resolved in one fell swoop. Also, unlike Ocasio-Cortez, he has skin in the game when it comes to creating a better future: \u201cSocialism is not what I want for my kids and my grandkids.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez recently suggested she may not have kids since the threat of climate change has made the thought of doing so \u201cbittersweet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose three weeks spent in Puerto Rico, cleaning up and helping repair a world his kids and grandkids will inherit, versus Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endless media appearances touting the toothless Green New Deal, provide a neat juxtaposition. The day after I speak with Cabrera, Ocasio-Cortez, as if eager to make his point, tweets jubilantly about the socialist virtues of Denmark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThank you everyone for the birthday wishes,\u201d she writes. \u201cSpending the day in Denmark after C40, enjoying this social democracy that treats healthcare & education as rights, zero-carbon as priority, & infrastructure as a key public good.\u201d\n\nAsked how, as a congressman, he would spend the free time he\u2019d gain by forgoing projects like the Green New Deal and, presumably, trips to Denmark, Cabrera suggests he would continue the work he\u2019s done throughout his career, but on a larger scale, with considerably more resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat means he would continue working to curb gun violence. Once again, the dichotomy between himself and his opponent rears its head. In 2012, Cabrera founded the Gun Violence Task Force with fellow councilman Jumaane Williams now the city\u2019s public advocate. As co-chairs of the task force, Williams and Cabrera helped implement the Cure Violence program, which trains and sends out former gang members from Brooklyn and the South Bronx to interrupt insidious cycles of violence in the neighborhoods they grew up in. The program has been effective: \u201cIn the South Bronx Cure Violence site, the analysis revealed significant declines in shooting victimizations,\u201d according to a 2017 report from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Cabrera wants federal funding to expand this program, which currently encompasses just ten square blocks in his district.\n\nHe sees Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s histrionic calls for overarching federal gun-control legislation, usually issued in the wake of a mass shooting or an outbreak of violence thousands of miles from her own district, as yet another empty gesture. \u201cShe\u2019s nowhere to be found here,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019ll point the finger at Chicago, but in her own backyard we have seen the rates of crime climb through the roof.\u201d Indeed, both police precincts that are entirely encompassed by the 14th congressional district have experienced more than twice as many gun deaths in 2019 than in the year prior, according to weekly NYPD crime reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to the apparent gap between their governing philosophies, he and Ocasio-Cortez have diametrically opposed social values. \u201cI\u2019m about family, faith, and community,\u201d says Cabrera, who was born to a Puerto Rican and a Dominican immigrant and raised in the Bronx. Like much of his congregation and, he argues, much of the congressional district he hopes to represent, he is socially conservative.\n\nHe was pilloried by fellow Democrats on the city council in 2014 after a video surfaced of him praising Uganda\u2019s adherence to Christian doctrine and its prohibition against gay marriage. The video emerged soon after Uganda passed a law making homosexuality punishable by life in prison, though Cabrera does not mention that legislation specifically in the video. While he holds traditional views on marriage and opposes abortion, he is sure to tell me that he\u2019s worked with every stripe of New Yorker during his years as a pastor and in his nine years on the city council.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOcasio-Cortez, by contrast, helped fundraise for the British transgender-rights group Mermaid Coalition, as one of her first acts in office. As our own Madeleine Kearns reported in January, \u201cthe 29-year-old congresswoman appeared in a livestream to support Harry Brews, a British gamer, who played the entire game of Donkey Kong in one sitting in order to raise $340,000 for Mermaids UK, a British charity that promotes sex changes for gender-confused children.\u201d\n\nCabrera is convinced his traditional values better reflect the district and will win out over AOC\u2019s particular brand of social-media-friendly progressivism. \u201cIt\u2019s a moderate to conservative district,\u201d Cabrera says. \u201cI\u2019m a match, I\u2019m a perfect fit, I\u2019m a reflection the people.\u201d\n\nCabrera is under no illusions about the uphill battle he\u2019s facing. He recognizes that the country\u2019s young progressives, spurred on by sympathetic and monolithic national media, have rallied around Ocasio-Cortez as the epitome of authenticity. After all, she livestreams herself making mac and cheese. Cabrera\u2019s campaign rests on his belief that New Yorkers have a finely tuned nose for the real thing and they\u2019ve realized Ocasio-Cortez doesn\u2019t qualify.\n\n\u201cIn this district we\u2019re not impressed with any type of celebrity status,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want elected officials who are able to produce results and she has utterly failed.\u201d We\u2019ll find out, on June 23, 2020, whether his faith in New Yorkers is justified.\n\nSomething to Consider If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.
