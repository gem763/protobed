(Jonathan Dupaul /CBC)\n\nMoney hasn't materialized\n\nWhen cannabis was legalized last year, the federal minister handling the file said revenue generated from the excise tax on the drug should be reinvested in research, preventative treatment and rehabilitation.\n\nBut clinicians at CHEO, the Ottawa Hospital and OPH say little of that money has trickled down to communities to address the consequences of cannabis on young people.\n\n\"There is a good case for reducing our health-care costs by working upstream and preventing these issues from becoming something that requires hospitalization,\" Francispillai said.\n\nOPH is about to launch a program developed by the federal government and geared toward students in Grade 8, one of the few resources the public health agency says it's received since legalization.\n\nLink to mental health\n\nA complicating factor highlighted in the CIHI report is the fact that a large majority of cannabis-related hospitalizations also involved mental illness.\n\nSixty-nine per cent of the young people admitted to hospital for substance use also required care for mental illness; amongh those admitted for cannabis use, 81 per cent also required mental health care, nearly double the rate among adults 25 and older.\n\nWe tend not to see as common a link between the substance use and a mental illness.\u200b\u200b\u200b - Geoff Hynes, CIHI\n\n\"This is also one of the really unique things about this analysis,\" said Geoff Hynes, a manager with CIHI. \"We tend not to see as common a link between the substance use and a mental illness.\"\n\nCHEO psychiatrist Sinthuja Suntharalingam said she sees that link every day among her own patients, and the wait for treatment after a hospital visit can take up to three months.\n\n\"[Youth] have a high risk of relapsing once they walk out of the hospital,\" Suntharalingham said. The CIHI study found nearly one in five patients had been hospitalized previously.\n\nSuntharalingham said while there are models for effective followup in other cities like Vancouver, they're \"lacking\" in Ottawa.\n\n\"It's great to see this report come out. It just makes us more aware of the problems that we are seeing as clinicians,\" she said.\n\nDr. Peter Tanuseputro is a physician-scientist at the Ottawa Hospital. (Julie Ireton/CBC)\n\nOttawa Hospital research\n\nThe Ottawa Hospital is also tracking the impact of cannabis on young people.\n\nResearchers there have published findings on emergency room visits related to alcohol consumption dating to 2003, and the hospital is getting ready to publish an accompanying study on cannabis-related ER visits over the same period.\n\nResearcher Peter Tanuseputro said the early findings support CIHI's results. He said the rate of hospitalization among for cannabis-related issues between 2003 and 2016 remained steady, except for a notable rise in ER visits by children under 14.\n\nThat research, like the CIHI study, was carried out before legalization.\n\n\"What's happening now with increasing access to alcohol and cannabis, these harms will potentially increase,\" Tanuseputro said.\n\nWhere to get help:\n\nCanada Suicide Prevention Service: 1-833-456-4566 (phone) | 45645 (text) | crisisservicescanada.ca (chat).\n\nIn Quebec (French): Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de pr\u00e9vention du suicide: 1-866-APPELLE (1-866-277-3553).\n\nKids Help Phone: 1-800-668-6868 (phone), www.kidshelpphone.ca (live chat counselling).\n\nCanadian Association for Suicide Prevention: Find a 24-hour crisis centre.", "description": "New research showing cannabis is outpacing alcohol as a cause of hospitalization among youth confirms the need for continuing government funding for drug education, Ottawa health-care advocates say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4044964.1490742293!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/teens-marijuana-20161124.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
