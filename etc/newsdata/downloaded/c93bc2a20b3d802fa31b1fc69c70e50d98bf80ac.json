Ah well, when you\u2019re on death row at a few minutes to midnight, you\u2019re entitled to celebrate a postponement.\n\nBut what exactly were they (we \u2013 I punched the air too) celebrating? Fresh hope that the capital sentence might be overturned on appeal? Or nothing more than the last meal chef being told to leave it for today and come back next week?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nTime will tell, but the prospects for the former aren\u2019t spiffing. While the country does what it always done when invited, and stares in captivation at a meaningless distraction (Johnson\u2019s unsigned letter asking the EU for a Brexit extension), the doors to the lethal injection chamber remain open.\n\nIf you think Oliver Letwin has slain the no-deal kraken, it\u2019s my painful duty to disabuse you of that consolation. Should Boris Johnson\u2019s deal pass today, as right now appears probable, the future is mortifyingly bleak.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

70/70 Angela Christofilou/The Independent\n\nAfter departing the EU in name if not in deed, whether on 31 October or some weeks later, there will be a little over a year for this government to negotiate a trade deal.\n\nDeals between significant trading powers are things of enormous complexity. Even between willing participants, they take many years to finalise. Nothing vaguely comparable has been achieved in much less than a decade.\n\nUnless Britain and the EU do a Bob Beamon to the world trade deal record, and smash it by about seven years, the Letwin amendment will go down not as a ray of blazing sunlight, but as the falsest dawn that ever broke. At the end of 2020, the hardest of Brexits will kick in.\n\nThat timeframe can be changed. But that relies on Boris Johnson requesting an extension to the negotiation period by the end of next June. That seems unlikely, and unimaginable if by then he has won a general election.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been wondering why, despite it hoisting the white flag over Theresa May\u2019s Irish-sea red line, the Johnson deal has the ERG crazies spaffing all over the walls like Multiple Miggs in the cell next to Hannibal Lecter\u2019s, this could be your answer.\n\nSlower than previously, but as inexorably as ever, we are being driven to the cliff edge by Thelma Johnson and Louise Rees-Mogg as they sit in the front seats in the Savile Row parachutes that their wealth affords them.\n\nThere is one guaranteed escape route, and another with potential but no certainties. The former is the removal of this government, and its replacement by another of national unity that revokes Article 50 and/or calls a second referendum.\n\nThe infantile posturing of Jo Swinson in refusing to consider a short-term Downing Street tenancy for Jeremy Corbyn, and Corbyn\u2019s almost equally babyish refusal to stand aside for a compromise candidate, prevented that vessel leaving dry dock.\n\nThe last chance is an amendment to Johnson\u2019s surrender bill mandating its confirmation via a second referendum in which a chance to Remain is also on the ballot.\n\nKeir Starmer tells us Labour will table such an amendment this week. Who knows, maybe it will. Perhaps Corbyn will accept a Final Say as the most viable way to defend the employment and environmental rights Johnson is desperate to bin. Failing that epiphany, perhaps Starmer, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry will tag team Uncle Duffer, and threaten to resign en masse.\n\nIf Corbyn agrees, voluntarily or by coercion, to whip such an amendment, its chances will rest on two questions. Are the DUP MPs sufficiently livid that Arlene Foster is the latest model to roll off the Johnson conveyor belt of deceived women, as some have hinted they might? Can Labour MPs currently minded to vote for Johnson\u2019s deal be persuaded to promote their constituents\u2019 interests above their own?\n\nIt\u2019s as easy for the outsider to be glib about such a dilemmas as it\u2019s hard for the insider to risk status and income. But if they can\u2019t take inspiration from the Tories who threw away their political futures to support the Benn Act, the likes of Caroline Flint will have to live with this knowledge: they enabled an act of vindictive national mutilation from behind a smokescreen of their own bespoke, crudely self-serving definition of what democracy means.\n\nWhether ultimately they find that prospect more or less palatable than risking their careers will, if the amendment is brought and backed by the DUP, decide the future.\n\nI wish them well with their deliberations as we near the moment of truth. What will be decided in the days ahead goes beyond another crack at remaining EU citizens. Also to be determined is whether we continue tolerating the misrule of an alliance between a tiny sect of the moneyed elected, and a tinier cabal of billionaires whose newspapers defile the notion of a free press by intimidating MPs and inveigling readers into voting directly against their economic and social interests.\n\nThe most ambitious con trick ever attempted is a whisker from succeeding. If it does, it won\u2019t just be the principal villains on whom tomorrow\u2019s history undergrads will gaze in incredulous revulsion.
