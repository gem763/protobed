With soaring infection rates among wounded soldiers, Confederate Surgeon General Samuel Moore commissioned Francis Porcher, a botanist and surgeon from South Carolina, to compile a book of medicinal plants found in the Southern states. Porcher was asked to include folk remedies used by white Southerners, as well as those used by enslaved Africans and indigenous peoples.\n\nImage: Stephen Nowland, Emory University\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe book, titled \u201cResources of the Southern Fields and Forests,\u201d was published in 1863. The compendium was amazingly thorough, and included, for example, nearly 40 plant species used to treat gangrene and other infections. Equipped with this book, Moore sketched out a condensed version called \u201cStandard supply table of the indigenous remedies for field service and the sick in general hospitals,\u201d which neatly described the way in which the field guide was used by the South during the latter stages of the Civil War.\n\n\n\nThis guide likely came in handy. As the war raged on, and as conventional medicines became scarce, disease began to exert a terrible toll on soldiers. The majority of casualties and deaths in the Civil War, as the American Battle Trust points out, were the result of non-combat-related diseases. Germ theory was still in its nascent stage of development, yet doctors understood the importance of using antiseptics to stave of infections even if it wasn\u2019t immediately obvious as to why.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo assess the antimicrobial potential of these Civil War-era remedies, Quave and her colleagues selected three specific plant-based medicines to test in the lab, specifically those derived from the white oak and tulip poplar (both trees) and devil\u2019s walking stick (a thorny, woody shrub). All three were used during the war as a topical, or external, rinse for wounds. Using Porter\u2019s book as their guide, the researchers selected specific extracts from the bark, leaves, galls, and other parts of the plants. These compounds were then tested against three species of drug-resistant bacteria associated with wounds, namely Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.\n\n\u201cWe found that they worked against a number of bacteria that are commonly implicated in [wartime] wounds\u2014including drug-resistant strains,\u201d said Quave. \u201cWhile some exhibited classic antibiotic activity\u2014such as slowing down the growth or killing the bacteria\u2014others acted by blocking the bacteria\u2019s ability to stick to surfaces (important to wounds) or by blocking bacterial communication responsible for the production of toxins that destroy tissues.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked if doctors would ever want to treat an infection solely with one of these remedies, Quave said it would depend on the context.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe these would be effective as an oral medication to treat a systemic infection, but they could be potentially useful in wound care\u2014perhaps formulated as a wound rinse, hydrogel, or medicated bandage,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis new scientific research confirms that folk medicine used in the Civil War actually did fight bacteria and prevent infection,\u201d Joan E. Cashin, a historian at the Ohio State University and author of War Stuff: The Struggle For Human And Environmental Resources In The American Civil War, wrote in an email to Gizmodo. \u201cThese staggering results prove yet again that truth\u2014and history\u2014is stranger than fiction,\u201d said Cashin, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new study.\n\nLooking ahead, Quave would like to determine which compounds are responsible for the specific antibacterial activities observed in the study, and to test formulations of the most promising extracts in wounds infected with antibiotic resistant bacteria. Ultimately, Quave would like to see these discoveries translated to actual medicines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPerhaps the best implementation will be as a topical antimicrobial medical device\u2014like a hydrogel, wound rinse, or medicated bandage,\u201d she said.", "description": "With conventional medicines in short supply during the Civil War, the Confederacy turned to plant-based alternatives in desperation.
