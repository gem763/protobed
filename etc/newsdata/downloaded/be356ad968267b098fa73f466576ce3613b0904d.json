Here\u2019s What to Expect.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nShares of food maker General Mills (ticker: GIS) are up some 40% this year, about double that of the S&P 500. The company\u2019s signature brands include Betty Crocker, Haagen-Dazs ice cream, and Cheerios.\n\nIts cereal products have performed well in the U.S. and helped boost the stock, according to a recent research note by Guggenheim, which also said the company\u2019s yogurt business is stabilizing.\n\nBut when the company releases its fiscal first-quarter earnings before the opening bell on Wednesday, investors will be paying close attention to one of its newest brands\u2014natural-pet-food maker Blue Buffalo.\n\nFactSet\u2019s consensus first-quarter profit estimate for the company is 77 cents a share, up from 71 cents in the corresponding period a year ago.\n\nA key metric will be the company\u2019s organic sales growth, to which Blue Buffalo is expected to be a big contributor. General Mills acquired Blue Buffalo last year for about $8 billion.\n\nIn the company\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter, the pet segment\u2019s revenue totaled just over $400 million, or about 10% of the company\u2019s total sales.\n\nThe Street is looking for the company\u2019s first-quarter organic sales to increase 0.7%, according to JPMorgan, though the company\u2019s own analysts are expecting a 0.2% boost.\n\nGuggenheim, however, forecasts an increase of 0.8%, helped by the Blue Buffalo line that \u201cis gaining distribution outside the pet specialty channel.\u201d It expects that business to help support upward earnings revisions throughout the year. Organic sales disappointed the market in the fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nThe FactSet consensus estimate for this fiscal year, which ends next May, is $3.35 a share, up from $3.22 in the previous year. The stock yields 3.6%.\n\nInvestors also will be keeping tabs on a series of management changes announced last month. That includes a succession plan for the current chief financial officer.\n\nWrite to Lawrence C.
