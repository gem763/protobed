The city government has decided to expand the number of winners from 1,000 to 7,500. A city official said as of the end of May, 8,499 senior citizens had turned in their licenses.\n\nThe measure, which follows a spate of fatal car accidents caused by elderly drivers, is aimed at prodding them to stop driving and use public transportation.\n\nWinners are given a W100,000 public-transport card that can also be used in convenience stores. Anyone born before Dec. 31, 1949 can apply.", "description": "8,500 Senior Citizens Turn in Driver's Licenses", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-07-02"}
