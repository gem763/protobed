A trust for RuPaul Charles, creator and producer of reality-TV hit \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d closed on the new digs in late September, property records show.\n\n\n\nMore: Paul Allen\u2019s Beverly Hills Development Site Lists for $110 Million\n\nCompleted in 1991, the palatial six-bedroom house spans over 10,300 square feet and sits on roughly half an acre by celebrity-favored Coldwater Canyon, according to the listing with Myra and Michael Nourmand of Nourmand & Associates-Berkshire Hathaway. The agents did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\n\n\nThe cavernous interiors feature double-height ceilings across much of the first floor, including a dramatic marble-tiled entryway. Same goes for the voluminous dining room, which is flooded with light from a trifecta of soaring glass French doors.\n\n\n\nElaborate molding, fireplaces and intricately patterned French parquet floors add to the home\u2019s regal European vibe.\n\n\n\nThere are also all of the add-ons one comes to expect from a Beverly Hills megamansion, including a wine cellar, home gym and media room. The private back terrace\u2014lined in tall hedges\u2014features a regency-style pool with a spa and elegant gazebo.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Airbus Ruling Will Push Imported Wine and Cheese Prices Higher\n\nMr. Charles, who could not be reached for comment, cut a deal on his new abode, coming in after the home received numerous price cuts. It originally listed a year ago asking a hair below $20 million.\n\n\n\nA major upgrade for the star, the luxurious home underscores the success of the entertainer\u2019s self-titled TV series, which just expanded its drag competitions across the pond with a U.K. launch this week. The new home is more than triple the size of a modest house he\u2019s owned in West Hollywood since 2011, property records show.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-113935?size=1.695364238410596&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
