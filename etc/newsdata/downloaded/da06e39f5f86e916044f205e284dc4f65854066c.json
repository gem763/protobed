The president has alleged there were corrupt dealings on behalf of the Bidens.\n\nThe Democrats noted in their letter Mr. Trump mentioned Mr. Barr\u2019s name five times during the call.\n\n\u201cImpartial enforcement of the law is essential to give the American public confidence in the Justice Department\u2019s work. Your personal connection to these matters creates the appearance of a conflict of interest,\u201d their letter read.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we request that you recuse yourself and identify the appropriate official who will be responsible for these matters,\u201d they added.\n\nA spokesperson for Mr. Barr declined to comment for this story.\n\nMark Graber, a law professor at the University of Maryland, said Mr. Barr should at least consult with ethics experts at the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cIt is a tradition in these cases that there is a potential conflict that, in fact, the attorney general should talk with other people. This is not an attorney general that believes in conflicts of interest,\u201d Mr. Graber said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
