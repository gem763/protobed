In 1992, I was born a U.S. citizen thanks to their bravery and sacrifice.\u201d\n\nGomez said that over the course of four decades, other members of her family have \u201cworked hard\u201d to secure their own United States citizenship. While she thinks about the immigration \u201cevery day,\u201d she never takes for granted the good fortune of being born in the U.S.\n\n\u201cBut when I read the news headlines or see debates about immigration rage on social media, I feel afraid for those in similar situations,\u201d she added. \u201cI feel afraid for my country.\u201d\n\nIn her essay, the former Disney star explained that to her, immigration isn\u2019t so much a political issue, but rather a matter of real people's lives and how they\u2019re all affected.\n\nSELENA GOMEZ SPEAKS OUT ABOT THE 'SCARIEST' MOMENT OF HER LIFE, HOW SHE OVERCAME ANXIETY, DEPRESSION\n\n\u201cIt is a human issue, affecting real people, dismantling real lives. How we deal with it speaks to our humanity, our empathy, our compassion. How we treat our fellow human beings defines who we are.\u201d\n\nWhile Gomez made it a point to say she isn\u2019t an expert on the matter, it didn\u2019t stop her from signing on to executive produce a docuseries called \u201cLiving Undocumented\u201d in 2017. It followed eight families facing possible deportation and chronicled their day-to-day struggles. Gomez said watching the trailer for the first time struck her to her core.\n\n\u201cIt captured the shame, uncertainty and fear I saw my own family struggle with,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it also captured the hope, optimism and patriotism so many undocumented immigrants still hold in their hearts despite the hell they go through.\u201d\n\nSELENA GOMEZ STUNS IN BLACK DRESS WITH KNEE-HIGH SLIT AT COUSIN'S TEXAS WEDDING\n\nThe \u201cBack to You\u201d singer ended her article by acknowledging the backlash she might face by publicly supporting undocumented immigrants. She said she was channeling the spirits of those before her in being fearless, which helped her discover a passion for giving voice to the voiceless.\n\n\u201cWhen I signed on to executive produce a show about undocumented immigrants, I couldn\u2019t help but anticipate the criticisms I might face,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut the truth is, the worst criticism I can imagine is still nothing compared to what undocumented immigrants face every day.\u201d\n\nCLICK TO VISIT THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cFear shouldn\u2019t stop us from getting involved and educating ourselves on an issue that affects millions of people in our country. Fear didn\u2019t stop my aunt from getting into the back of that truck. And for that, I will always be grateful.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiving Undocumented\u201d will be made available to stream on Netflix beginning Wednesday, Oct. 2.", "description": "Selena Gomez is riling in emotional discomfort as she witnesses the ongoing immigration crisis in our country.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/selena-gomez-SGOMEX0719.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
