The group\u2019s song became a hit, inspiring a deluge of memes and fan art, and players could even dress up as the members in-game. Now developer Riot is following that up with another in-game musical act: a hip-hop group called True Damage. The studio even worked with Louis Vuitton on some of the unlockable skin designs.\n\nTrue Damage is a group made up of five League heroes, including Qiyana, Akali, Ekko, Yasuo, and the recently added Senna, and starting November 10th players will be able to purchase their new looks as in-game skins; that same day, the virtual group will appear onstage at the Worlds 2019 opening ceremonies. The IRL version of the band will be made up of artists Becky G, Keke Palmer, Soyeon, Duckwrth, and Thutmose.\n\n\u201cIt took a while to figure out what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nAccording to Carlos Giffoni, lead producer for skins at Riot, the success of K/DA largely inspired the new project. \u201cShortly after that we started working on True Damage,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt took a while to figure out what we\u2019re doing, what\u2019s the story behind it.\u201d There\u2019s even a narrative element tying the two events together. In the lore, Akali, a member of K/DA, sets out to find new collaborators, ultimately forming True Damage. \u201cWe wanted to have a group of people that felt really eclectic, and that felt like they had really unique roles to bring into it,\u201d Giffoni says of the process of finding the right characters for the group.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month Riot revealed that it was collaborating with famed fashion house Louis Vuitton, and that partnership will connect to the True Damage project. Both Qiyana and Senna will feature \u201cprestige\u201d skins designed by LV artistic director Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re. (You can see Qiyana\u2019s above, while Senna\u2019s will be available early next year.) And you won\u2019t have to pay Louis Vuitton prices to unlock them; Qiyana\u2019s LV skin will only be available by playing a Worlds 2019 in-game event.\n\n\u201cIt started off more as a question,\u201d Riot art director Seth Haak says of the collaboration. \u201cCould we do this? Would it make sense? We just wanted to feel it out at first, I think on both sides.\u201d Louis Vuitton came on board after the True Damage project had already been established, and Haak traveled to Paris to pitch the concept. \u201cIt was pretty uncanny how on the same page they were with us,\u201d he says. A week after that meeting, designers from LV came back with some ideas, and Haak says that they fit the project\u2019s visual aesthetic almost perfectly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t actually have to alter any of the designs, besides some color so that it would play well with gameplay,\u201d he says.\n\nGetting hip-hop and high fashion to fit into a game like League of Legends wasn\u2019t an easy task. It meant identifying current design trends, but also tweaking them so that they wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a universe with talking cats and time traveling assassins. \u201cJust putting clothes on champions in-game doesn\u2019t always work very well,\u201d Haak says. \u201cA lot of it should feel lived-in. So if anyone is carrying a sword or a weapon, or a personal object, it has to feel like they own it. It\u2019s precious to them. Just like you would see a producer in a music studio with stickers all over their stuff, because it\u2019s theirs.\u201d\n\nTrue Damage is also emblematic of a change at Riot. In the past, the developer would come up with new skins and cosmetic updates, and then create a story to make them fit in the universe. Now, with projects like this, it\u2019s the other way around. That\u2019s part of the reason why the character Akali is the connecting thread between K/DA and True Damage. \u201cWe used to just do visuals, throw them out there, and create a story to go along with it as an afterthought,\u201d says Haak. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen how painful that has been. So over the years we\u2019ve realized that the story really sets the tone, and it sets a target for us as a team.\u201d", "description": "Riot Games is following up its League of Legends K-pop group K/DA with a new hip-hop collective called True Damage, which will feature outfits designed by Louis Vuitton.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OMLSihKDM7JVn787zDTwD2-ns7w=/0x75:3840x2085/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19326440/QxLV.MARQUEE.1920x1080_1021_C.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
