By comparison, the ratio between commercial and residential tax rates were significantly lower in Mississauga (2.4-to-1), Hamilton (2.7-to-1) and Brampton (2.1-to-1).\n\nCrucially, higher tax rates on businesses can erode competitiveness, leading to migration of businesses, reduced hiring and investment, and business closures.\n\n\u201cAcross the region, but particularly in the City of Toronto, businesses face a higher property tax burden than residents, with little justification for the higher rates,\u201d Filipowicz said.\n\n\u201cProperty taxes should reflect the level of services used by ratepayers, so local and provincial governments need to demonstrate how businesses in Toronto consume nearly four times the local services that residents do.\u201d\n\nMEDIA CONTACT:\n\nJosef Filipowicz, Senior Policy Analyst\n\nFraser Institute\n\nTo arrange media interviews or for more information, please contact:\n\nBryn Weese, Associate Director, Communications\n\nFraser Institute\n\nTel: (604) 688-0221 ext. 589\n\nE-mail: bryn.weese@fraserinstitute.org\n\nFollow the Fraser Institute on Twitter | Like us on Facebook", "description": "", "authors": ["Fraser Institute"], "top_image": "http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/497700?filename=497700.jpg&size=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
