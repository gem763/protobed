He will undergo surgery and is projected to miss around six weeks. (AP)\n\nBrees left the game immediately, and was replaced by Teddy Bridgewater.\n\nThe 40-year-old quarterback told media after the game that he was concerned and would remain in Los Angeles to see a hand specialist.\n\nA second ESPN report said Brees knew last night that he would need surgery and he was just deciding who would do the procedure and when.\n\nThe Saints play at Seattle on Sunday, and coach Sean Payton now must prepare Bridgewater to face the Seahawks on their home turf, one of the loudest stadiums in the NFL.\n\nWhile Bridgewater is experienced, he did not play particularly well against the Rams, completing 17 of 30 passes for 165 yards. New Orleans did not score a touchdown in the 27-9 loss on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nBridgewater started the Saints\u2019 regular-season finale last year, completing 63.6 percent of his passes with one touchdown and one interception in a loss to the Carolina Panthers.\n\nAssuming he starts all of New Orleans\u2019 games during Brees\u2019 absence, it will be the first time since 2015, when he was the Minnesota Vikings\u2019 Pro Bowl starter, that Bridgewater will start multiple games.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 2014 first-round pick suffered a horrific knee injury just days before the 2016 opener, and the recovery was lengthy. The doctor who operated on Bridgewater said it was \u201chorribly grotesque\u201d inside Bridgewater\u2019s knee when he cut it open.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Not the news the Saints were hoping to get.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wubYCMjSCrdOoLINpQVF0A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/m2er1ZbXHNvdTMsXP1iJnw--~B/aD0yNzgxO3c9NDE3MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/433f8820-d893-11e9-a769-00f1709002a3"}
