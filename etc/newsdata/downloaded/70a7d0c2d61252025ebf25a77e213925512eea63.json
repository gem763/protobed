I was scared that trousers would make me feel stuffy and frumpy. But as I narrowed down the style of pant and more and more brands came out with unique silhouettes, I was hooked. Trousers are an upgrade from your repetitive denim decisions. Give your jeans a break and find some trousers you love for your work outfit rotation \u2013 or even casual weekend looks. I\u2019ve narrowed it down to four specific silhouettes that should be in everyone\u2019s closet:\n\nEcupper Womens Casual Loose Elastic Waist Cotton Trouser, $30 on Amazon: These highly-rated wide-leg pants are made from easy, breezy 100% cotton. They come in 15 different colors and patterns, so you can easily get more than one and wear them all the time. The slight crop makes them perfect to wear with everything from sandals to boots.\n\nSkyline Pant, $72 at Athleta: As a short girl, tapered leg trousers are my jam. This option from Athleta combines the classic, drapey silhouette with a tapered ankle, slight paper bag waist, and the brand\u2019s Recycled Featherweight Stretch fabric. They\u2019re light and airy but won\u2019t get all wrinkled from sitting in them all day. The 4.8-star rating from 1,400+ reviews can\u2019t be wrong.\n\nMadewell x Dickies Twill Pants, $78 at Madewell: What\u2019s old is new again with this Dickie\u2019s and Madewell collaboration. These straight-leg twill trousers hit all the marks for a comfortable, put-together outfit. Pair them with a button-down blouse for a uniform-inspired look or wear them on the weekend with a tee and sneakers.\n\nThe Curvy Side-Zip Work Pant, $50 at Everlane: These Everlane trousers were made with women\u2019s bodies in mind. They\u2019re cut to flatter any figure and are made from 4-way stretch cotton to cut down on the whole \u201cAre they leggings or are they pants?\u201d debate. The side-zip also helps keep the pant sleek and sophisticated.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
