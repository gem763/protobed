We believed in ourselves, everybody came through for us.\u201d\n\nAll the drama came early in Atlanta, where Braves starting pitcher Mike Foltynewicz \u2014 who pitched seven scoreless innings in a game-two victory \u2014 retired just one batter before he was pulled in the first frame.\n\nTommy Edman, Dexter Fowler and Kolten Wong each had two-run doubles, Cardinals pitcher Jack Flaherty walked with the bases loaded to force in a run, and St. Louis scored their final run of the first on a strikeout when Braves catcher Brian McCann couldn\u2019t corral a pitch in the dirt.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Relentless\u2019 \u2013\n\nSt. Louis sent 14 batters to the plate before Braves relief pitcher Max Fried finally ended the inning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to score 10 runs in an inning without hitting a home run,\u201d mused Cardinals manager Mike Shildt. \u201cBut just great at-bats, relentless.\u201d\n\nIn was the most ever runs in the first inning of a post-season game and tied for the most runs in any inning of a playoff game.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve seen that many guys hit in the first inning that quick in my entire life,\u201d said shellshocked Braves manager Brian Snitker. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It wasn\u2019t how we drew it up, I know that.\n\n\u201cThat thing just kept rolling and we couldn\u2019t stop it.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals\u2019 13 total runs matched their total in the first four games of the best-of-five NL Division Series.\n\nThe Braves endured their 10th straight playoff series defeat while the Cardinals wrapped up a 3-2 series win to reach the NLCS for the first time since 2014.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 The St. Louis Cardinals exploded for 10 runs in the biggest first inning in Major League Baseball playoff history on Wednesday,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/de1d91_st-louis-cardinals-celebrate-13-win-atlanta-braves-in-game-major-league-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
