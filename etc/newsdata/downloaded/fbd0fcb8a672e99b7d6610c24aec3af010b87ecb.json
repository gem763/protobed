No one at the state level seems inclined to prosecute the rogue mayor or any members of the city council, so they seem free to do what they want.\n\nYet a law that\u2019s unenforced is a law that might as well not exist. For preemption to mean anything in the state, it has to be enforced. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nSo far, the only way to enforce preemption is in the courts. Yet court battles are expensive and there\u2019s minimal negative impact for communities that flout preemption. Sure, they might have to pay attorney fees during the fight, but beyond that? Nothing.\n\nNow, a Pennsylvania law seeks to change all of that, and the Philadelphia Inquirer seems to have a different opinion of the bill.\n\nSometimes, the goal sought by a piece of legislation is clear. Sometimes it isn\u2019t. Take House Bill 1066, which was just one of several bills approved last week by the Pennsylvania House Judiciary Committee that could weaken gun reforms in the state. It takes a very close reading of HB 1066 to understand its aim: Scare Pennsylvania towns away from addressing the local issues surrounding firearms. One section states \u2014 and bear with the jargon: A person adversely affected by any manner of ordinance, resolution, rule, practice or other action promulgated or enforced by a COUNTY, MUNICIPALITY OR TOWNSHIP in violation of subsection (a) or 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 306(a) (relating to regulation of firearms and ammunition) . . . may seek declarative and injunctive relief and the actual damages attributable to the violation in an appropriate court. A later paragraph says the court \u201cshall award reasonable expenses to the person adversely affected\u201d if they succeed on their claim, or if the township revokes their ordinance after the claim is filed. \u2026 First, when law students see the above language, they ask: \u201cAha! Who counts as a \u2018person adversely affected?\u2019\u201d According to HB 1066, that includes not just individuals, but also: \u201cA membership organization, the members of which include\u201d a person who may legally possess firearm. This means that a \u201cmembership organization\u201d from outside of PA may file a case against one of our townships, simply because the township enacted a firearm ordinance. What\u2019s an example of such a \u201cmembership organization?\u201d The first that comes to my mind is the National Rifle Association. \u2026 This leads me to my second point. This is not standard for lawsuits in this country. The usual rule is that parties pay their own attorneys\u2019 fees, even if they win. This is so ingrained in our system it is known as the \u201cAmerican Rule.\u201d There are exceptions, to be sure. Sometimes, a party may have to pay the other side\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees as a sanction for misbehavior. Certain federal statutes allow fee-shifting. But the norm remains that each party pays their own attorneys\u2019 fees. HB 1066 is an exception to the American Rule.\n\nIn other words, the writer\u2013a law professor\u2013is upset not so much by the argument that the loser might be on the hook for the other side\u2019s legal fees since she notes that can and does happen already, but by the fact that a group she disfavors may benefit from this by design, to some degree.\n\nHowever, what the writer fails to note is that Pennsylvania has a preemption law that legally bars communities from passing their own gun control laws. Preemption laws have been upheld by the courts for years and there\u2019s little reason to believe that\u2019s likely to change any time soon. All this measure would do is allow gun rights groups\u2013as well as any other civil rights group, it should be argued\u2013to recoup their expenses from combatting laws that communities shouldn\u2019t be passing in the first place.\n\nCities like Pittsburgh know good and well that they\u2019re breaking state law by passing gun control ordinances, but they do it anyway. Why? Because they can.\n\nBy making them risk not just losing but potentially having to pay for the privilege of getting curb stomped in a court of law, the stakes get raised and might dissuade some communities from breaking that law.\n\nThe writer argues the bill will \u201c[s]care Pennsylvania towns away from addressing the local issues surrounding firearms.\u201d That\u2019s not quite accurate. What it does is provide a warning to those towns about the dangers of breaking the law.\n\nI\u2019m quite sure the writer wouldn\u2019t argue that jail time is a bad thing because it \u201cscares Pennsylvania residents from stealing money from stores at gunpoint.\u201d Why would she? That\u2019s precisely what the law is intending to do.\n\nIn this case, though, local governments are still free to explore measures to reduce violence. They just can\u2019t enact controversial gun control measures out of hand. That\u2019s a role the state has reserved for themselves.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like it, then repeal preemption.\n\nWhat? They can\u2019t?\n\nOh. Well\u2026too bad.", "description": "The bill could put communities that pass things like local gun control laws on the hook for the other side's legal fees.
