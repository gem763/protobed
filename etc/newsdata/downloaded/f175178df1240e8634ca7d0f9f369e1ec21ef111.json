Trump and the Republican Party have already launched a $10 million ad blitz, largely aimed at Biden over his son\u2019s business ties to Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s ballooning reelection campaign shattered fundraising records in the third quarter, and his campaign continued to pull a steady stream of money from donors giving less than $200, new filings show.\n\nThe two candidates vying for the Democratic nomination who lead in fundraising \u2014 Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2014 have eschewed wealthy backers and fancy fundraisers. Biden, meanwhile, has relied on a more traditional fundraising model, appearing at a series of private fundraisers catering to the party\u2019s wealthy donors.\n\nThe limitations of Biden\u2019s strategy were reflected in his figures from the third quarter \u2014 a notoriously difficult time for raising money through private fundraisers, due to the summer lull.\n\nAD\n\nAmong Biden\u2019s biggest expenses in the third quarter were $924,000 spent on EJCR, LLC, a company that offers private jet charter services, records show. In comparison, Warren and Sanders spent considerably less on private air charters, filings show.\n\nAD\n\nBiden campaign officials said they are confident they have the resources they need to build a winning presidential campaign. The campaign declined to expand on details of his expenses.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental question about fundraising is: Do you have what you need to run your race? And we do,\u201d said Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and two affiliated committees raised $85 million in the third quarter, filings show. Along with the Republican National Committee, pro-Trump committees have $158 million on hand, Trump\u2019s campaign said Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAmong the biggest donors to Trump Victory, one of the affiliated committees, were prominent Trump donors: billionaire executive chairman of Colony NorthStar Thomas J. Barrack Jr. ($360,000); Blackstone Group chief executive Stephen Schwarzman ($250,000); and Ray Washburne, former head of the Overseas Private Investment Corp. ($100,000).\n\nAD\n\nThree registered federal lobbyists with ties to the Trump campaign and administration reported raising $910,000 for Trump Victory: Brian Ballard, Jeffrey Miller and Jason Osborne, filings show.\n\nMain campaign expenses for Trump include $4.6 million to America Made Media Consultants, a company that places ads for the reelection. Parscale Strategy, the company owned by Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, billed the campaign $512,304 for consulting servies.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s main campaign committee saw a surge in legal fees in the third quarter, paying more than $2 million to various law firms. And Trump properties continued to benefit from the reelection effort, with Trump Victory spending $130,000 at the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nThe top fundraisers of the quarter were Sanders ($25.3 million); Warren ($24.7 million); Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. ($19.2 million); Biden ($15.7 million); and Sen. Kamala Harris of California ($11.8 million).\n\nAD\n\nSanders had $33.7 million cash on hand at the end of the quarter, filings show. Warren had $25.7 million; Buttigieg had $23.4 million; Harris had $10.5 million; and Biden had $9 million.\n\nAD\n\nAmong the five, Harris and Biden spent more money in the third quarter than they raised.\n\nThe biggest expenses among the five campaigns this quarter went toward payroll, travel and advertising, as candidates built their ground operations in early primary states.\n\nBiden spent $6.7 million in payroll and payroll taxes; $1.3 million on travel; and another $2 million in digital and media ad buys.\n\nSanders spent nearly $7 million on payroll and associated costs and $3.8 million on fundraising and digital ads, among other major expenses.\n\nAmong the Warren campaign\u2019s biggest expenses were $7.5 million in payroll; $3.5 million in digital media; and $834,000 in travel.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome of Buttigieg\u2019s big-ticket items included $3.1 million on Facebook ads; $1 million on Google ads; and $5 million on payroll and related fees.\n\nHarris spent $3.8 million on salary and related costs, and $3.4 million on digital and media buys.\n\nThe filings made public Tuesday night covered the period from July 1 through Sept. 30. Most of the major presidential campaigns had released their total hauls prior to the filing deadline, but had not released details of their spending, which were reported Tuesday night with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nMatt Viser and Lenny Bronner contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The former vice president\u2019s campaign struggled to gain financial steam in the past three months.", "authors": ["Michelle Ye Hee Lee", "National Political Enterprise", "Accountability Reporter Covering Money", "Influence In Politics", "Anu Narayanswamy", "Database Reporter For The Political Enterprise Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Vc_H341FAy51IRXZd37hOD2GEhU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EJCPWSFZJQI6TIERNKLOM7M4ZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
