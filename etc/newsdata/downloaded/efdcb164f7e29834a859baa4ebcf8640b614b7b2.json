I\u2019m fuming.\n\n\u2018What the DWP are really telling people to do is to lie. It\u2019s insulting to both the disabled person but also to the employer.\n\n\u2018They have a duty of care towards their employees and to make adjustments to support them.\n\n\u2018How can they do that if the employee is being told by the government not to be forthcoming with any diagnosis?\n\n\u2018This is deeply unfair and extremely discriminatory to anyone with a health condition.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe advice was issued at a job centre in Dorset and a section of it was posted online by disability rights campaigners, sparking outrage.\n\nIt had the same wording as a \u2018positive health statement\u2019 that was circulated by the Dorset NHS trust issued in 2013.\n\nThen the form was described as a guide to \u2018how you can present yourself as someone living with a health condition in a positive way\u2019 when applying for a job.\n\nIt said: \u2018Avoid words that sound worse than they are, eg: chronic, degenerating, etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You may find it helpful to use official diagnosis terms, eg \u2018multiple sclerosis, PTSD.\n\n\u2018Equally, you may wish to avoid terms such as depression, ME, or low back pain etc and use more general terms such as low mood or a mental health condition, a fatigue-related condition, an ongoing pain condition etc.\u2019\n\nThe advice came from a job centre in Dorset (Picture: PA)\n\nUnder the Equality Act 2010, disabled people, including those with mental health problems, are entitled to protection if their disability has a substantial, adverse, and long term effect on normal day-to-day activities.\n\nSenior Policy and Campaigns Officer at mental health charity Mind, Ayaz Manji, said that guidance reinforced stigma.\n\nHe added: \u2018Advising prospective employees not to disclose their mental health problems could mean they don\u2019t access the reasonable adjustments at work they may be entitled to.\n\n\u2018For example, this might include things like flexible working, adjustments to shift patterns, or changing your working area.\n\n\u2018Anyone who discloses a mental health problem at work deserves to be treated with respect, and JobCentres should not be reinforcing stigma by advising people not to disclose.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s a decision that should be made on a case-by-case basis by the employee.\u2019\n\nLabour\u2019s Marsha De Cordova said it could not be right that people had to downplay health conditions (Picture: Rex)\n\nThe DWP said the advice was \u2018well-meaning\u2019 and only used in one area.\n\nCampaigners said they suspected the advice was being a trialled in Dorset with a view to being rolled out nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLabour\u2019s disability rights campaigner Marsha de Cordova raised the issue in the House of Commons today, saying: \u2018It cannot be right that the DWP is expecting disabled people to downplay their disability or health condition.\u2019\n\nWithin hours, the DWP pulled the Jobcentre document and said people should feel they can speak \u2018freely\u2019 about health conditions.\n\nA spokesman said: \u2018This was well-intentioned local advice but has been withdrawn, as we would always encourage jobseekers to speak freely about a health condition or disability.\n\n\u2018The number of disabled people in work is at a record high and we are proud of the support we provide such as grants of nearly \u00a360,000 for workplace adaptions under Access to Work.\u2019", "description": "Disabled people and those with long-term health conditions have been told to \u2018downplay\u2019 their medical issues, according to campaigners.
