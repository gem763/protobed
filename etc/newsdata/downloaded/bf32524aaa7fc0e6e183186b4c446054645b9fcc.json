And that worry that is out there continues to create opportunity,\u201d she says.\n\nOn Friday, a mixed jobs report functioned as an economic Rorschach test, confirming the recession fears of some while allaying the doomsday concerns of others. On the whole, markets rallied on the news. The jobs report came after a week of troubling data that includes a drop in manufacturing activity for the second consecutive month and a World Trade Organization prediction that global trade will fall dramatically.\n\nWhen panicky investors turn their backs, that gives savvy traders a chance to find undervalued stocks, Hobson said.\n\n\u201cEven though we've had this tremendous run in the stock market over the last decade, we're still finding value, because when companies disappoint, they basically get shot,\u201d she says. \u201cThey get left for dead. And it's those businesses that get left for dead that create an opportunity for us as value investors.\u201d\n\nHobson is the co-CEO of Ariel Investments, a firm with assets totaling $12.9 billion, where she worked for nearly the past three decades. Her Ted Talk on challenging racial inequality, given in 2014, has been viewed more than 3.7 million times.\n\nShe made the comments during a conversation that aired in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.\n\nAriel Investments Co-CEO Mellody Hobson appears on Influencers with Andy Serwer. More\n\nFor her part, Hobson said she does not see evidence of an impending recession.\n\n\u201cWe might see the economy slow, but we're not seeing a recession,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just don't see it right now.\u201d\n\nSpeaking before the release of October\u2019s jobs numbers, she said the recent employment data suggests an economy with strong upsides.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at some basic statistics, the employment numbers are so compelling. We've seen some wage inflation, which helps with consumer spending. Consumer confidence has stayed very, very high. There are a lot of positives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say that my view right now is, the market certainly is fully valued,\u201d she adds. \u201cHowever, we think the fundamentals, especially in the U.S., are still very good.\u201d\n\nAndy Serwer is editor-in-chief of Yahoo Finance.
