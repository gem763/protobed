Probably not. Probably he\u2019ll conclude that his mistake was not kissing the president\u2019s ass effusively enough these past few years, and that if only he reapplies himself with twice the vigor going forward he\u2019ll make a hawk of Trump yet. But I don\u2019t know. Eventually it has to dawn on him that shedding his dignity to become Trump\u2019s chief apologist has gotten him next to nothing on foreign policy. Maduro\u2019s still in power; we\u2019re getting jerked around by North Korea; Trump\u2019s made it clear that he wants no part of an attack on Iran; and now here he is clearing out of northern Syria to make Erdogan\u2019s task a bit easier in genociding the Kurds, who were the tip of the western spear against ISIS inside the country for the past five years. What exactly is Graham\u2019s reward for serving as Trump\u2019s political caddy?\n\nRight, I know: \u201cHe\u2019s getting reelected to the Senate.\u201d What a treat to have a safe seat from which you lack the power to influence anything, even when a friendly Republican is in the White House.\n\nHe\u2019s talking tough today, for what it\u2019s worth.\n\nHope and expect sanctions against Turkey \u2013 if necessary \u2013 would be veto-proof. This decision to abandon our Kurdish allies and turn Syria over to Russia, Iran, & Turkey will put every radical Islamist on steroids. Shot in the arm to the bad guys. Devastating for the good guys. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\nIs he right? Could sanctions on Turkey pass both chambers with veto-proof two-thirds majorities? Fair shot in the Senate, I\u2019d say, given that denunciations of Trump\u2019s move range from staunch allies like Graham to adversaries like Romney\u2026\n\nThe President\u2019s decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp \u2014 Senator Mitt Romney (@SenatorRomney) October 7, 2019\n\n\u2026to in-betweeners like Ben Sasse, who\u2019s caught between needing to maintain Trump\u2019s endorsement in his primary and needing to protect his image as a non-Trumpy old-fashioned conservative:\n\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, issued the following statement regarding the Administration\u2019s announced retreat from the Syria-Turkey border. \u201cIf the President sticks with this retreat, he needs to know that this bad decision will likely result in the slaughter of allies who fought with us, including women and children. I hope the President will listen to his generals and reconsider. And before Turkey butchers innocent Kurds, Erdogan should carefully consider his privileged status as a NATO member. The American people don\u2019t partner with genocidal regimes.\u201d\n\nThey can get 67 in the Senate. I\u2019m less convinced they can get 290 in the House. They\u2019d need more than 50 Republicans for that, possibly many more since some progressive Democrats may feel queasy about taking punitive action stemming from a withdrawal of U.S. troops. Doves are supposed to *support* withdrawal, right? Trump will be twisting arms among House Republicans too, warning them that voting with the Dems to embarrass him by sanctioning Turkey will earn them some attention on the presidential Twitter account ahead of their House primaries next year.\n\nOn the other hand, Liz Cheney is already rallying the troops to resist Trump on this. She\u2019s in the same bind Graham is \u2014 a stalwart hawk who\u2019s nonetheless eager for Trump\u2019s support ahead of an election, namely the open Senate seat in Wyoming. How far does Cheney want to go in crossing him?\n\nLiz Cheney calls withdrawal from northern Syria a \"catastrophic mistake\" pic.twitter.com/gas8fhCHoP \u2014 Aaron Blake (@AaronBlake) October 7, 2019\n\nEven if Republicans managed to pass sanctions with veto-proof majorities in both chambers, how would they get Trump to implement them? He\u2019s ignored them before, remember. They passed sanctions on Russia related to Putin\u2019s interference in the 2016 campaign (with veto-proof majorities) and later passed separate sanctions targeting Russia over the Skripal poisoning in the UK. In both cases Trump simply stuck the sanctions in a drawer, leaving Congress exasperated. Now that the Overton window has moved towards impeachment, I wonder what happens if Turkey sanctions make it through Congress with veto-proof majorities and Trump once again decides to blow them off. Do they impeach, or threaten to impeach, on grounds that he\u2019s not taking care to faithfully execute federal law?\n\nThe harshest criticism of Trump this morning came not from a member of Congress but from his own former top envoy in the war on ISIS, Brett McGurk. McGurk was a holdover from Obama\u2019s administration whom Trump kept on for nearly two years, until McGurk resigned in protest along with James Mattis over Trump\u2019s initial decision last year to withdraw from Syria. You can read his entire thread on today\u2019s decision here but this will give you the flavor:\n\nThe WH statement tonight on Syria after Trump spoke with Erdogan demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of anything happening on the ground. The \u201cUnited States\u201d is not holding any ISIS detainees. They are all being held by the SDF, which Trump just served up to Turkey. pic.twitter.com/vYr7j0q6mR \u2014 Brett McGurk (@brett_mcgurk) October 7, 2019\n\nISIS prisoners potentially released, a new pretext for deeper Iranian involvement in Syria, and a lot of dead Kurds: Can it really be true, as McGurk claims, that Trump made a decision like that without deliberation?

He reports for Fox News.\n\nAs for the president himself, he\u2019s answering his critics on Twitter today by sounding like a Bond villain who\u2019s been huffing paint. \u201cIn my great and unmatched wisdom\u201d?\n\n\u2026.the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nWho told him that he\u2019s obliterated the Turkish economy once before? Did he get confused watching a Tucker Carlson foreign-policy segment again? If he means he\u2019s done it before to another country, i.e. Iran, what makes him think Turkey will be as easy to damage as Iran was? China\u2019s been holding out amid his trade war pressure.\n\nAs for those who say that Trump\u2019s being true to his worldview, which is to end U.S. involvement in wars, that may or may not end up being true. The core argument by hawks against today\u2019s move is that the chaos unleashed by a Turkish/Kurdish war will be a gift to ISIS, necessitating a future U.S. incursion into Mesopotamia. What does Trump say to that? Turns out he\u2019s okay with it. If we need to redeploy and start \u201cblasting\u201d again, that\u2019s just what we\u2019ll do.\n\n\u2026.down, watching over a quagmire, & spending big dollars to do so. When I took over, our Military was totally depleted. Now it is stronger than ever before. The endless and ridiculous wars are ENDING! We will be focused on the big picture, knowing we can always go back & BLAST! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\n\u201cThere are many potential disastrous outcomes to this,\u201d said a U.S. official to WaPo about the prospect of Turkey\u2019s attack degrading security at Kurdish-run prison camps holding ISIS fighters. Mark Esper and Mark Milley should think about resigning soon, not necessarily out of protest but because Trump will naturally begin to search for scapegoats when this goes bad and, as SecDef and Joint Chiefs Chair, they\u2019re the most logical targets.
