The SEC alleged that Comscore was able to exceed revenue targets seven quarters in a row, which created the illusion of growth.\n\n\"Comscore recognized revenue on these transactions based on the fair value of the data it delivered, which had been improperly increased in order to inflate revenue,\" the SEC said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nMatta also lied to Comscore's internal accountants and external audit firm, the SEC alleged.\n\nComscore neither admits nor denies the charges, the media giant said in a statement the same day.\n\nComscore and Matta settled charges by agreeing to comply with the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in the future and paying fines. Comscore agreed to pay $5 million in penalties, while Matta paid $700,000 in addition to $2.1 million reimbursing Comscore for profits from the sale of its stock and other compensation.\n\nMatta is also blocked from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years.\n\n\"We will continue to hold issuers and executives accountable for such serious breaches of their fundamental duty to make accurate disclosures to the investing public while giving appropriate credit for a company's prompt remedial acts and cooperation,\" Melissa Hodgman, associate director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement.\n\nComscore said it cooperated with the SEC during the investigation and made significant efforts to address the charges, including replacing Matta as CEO and implementing new internal policies.\n\nAll senior managers who were with the company during the time the SEC says they committed fraud no longer work there, Comscore said.\n\nBryan Wiener, another former CEO, and Sarah Hofstetter, a former president, both resigned in March after less than a year in their roles.\n\nWiener reportedly parted ways with Comscore becasue of \"irreconcilable differences\" with the board over the company's strategy, according to The Hollywood Reporter's Natalie Jarvey.\n\nFormer chief operating officer Kathy Bachmann and former chief product officer Dan Hess soon followed, and the company cut 10% of its workforce in May and another 8% in August.\n\nVariety's Brian Steinberg reported that both Wiener and Hofstetter were brought in to help keep opperations at Comscore smooth as the accounting situation was investigated and resolved.\n\nThe firm told Business Insider it would be cashflow positive by the end of the year.\n\n\"We are pleased to have settled this legacy issue with the SEC,\" Brent Rosenthal, the chairman of the board at Comscore, said in a statement. \"In addition to our commitment to compliance and with this matter behind us, the board and I remain fully focused on the business and are committed to further developing our unique data assets, differentiated data analytics, and strong brand equity.\"", "description": "Comscore was charged with defrauding investors and the public about their performance.
