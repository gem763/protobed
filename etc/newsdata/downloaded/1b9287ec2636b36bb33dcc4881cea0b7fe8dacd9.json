A controversial shooting of a black resident by a white police officer in his city of South Bend, Ind., occasioned the emotional public meeting. Mayor Pete handled himself ably enough \u2014 there wasn\u2019t much alternative to taking his lumps \u2014 although the episode still highlights the manifest shortcomings of his candidacy.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe elite media fell in love with Buttigieg, not just because he\u2019s genuinely talented, but because he\u2019s the type of candidate \u2014 young, earnest, credentialed, progressive but with a self-image as an ideologically moderate pragmatist \u2014 it always falls in love with.\n\nIt is attracted to the idea of an intellectual as a presidential candidate. This doesn\u2019t literally mean someone with deep intellectual interests or genuine accomplishments \u2014 think the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan \u2014 but an impressive academic r\u00e9sum\u00e9, a copy of The New Yorker on the nightstand and true verbal acuity.\n\nIn this sense, Pete Buttigieg is the new Barack Obama, except with limits that will likely keep him from reaching the next level in the 2020 nomination contest and even if he did, would make him perhaps the weakest plausible prospective Democratic general-election candidate.\n\nLast week\u2019s town hall brought home just how small-scale Buttigieg\u2019s day job is. He\u2019s mayor of roughly the 300th-largest city in America. He could govern a city twice the size of South Bend \u2014 say, Glendale, Calif., or Fayetteville, N.C. \u2014 and still not crack the list of the top 100 cities in the country. Some county supervisors have more responsibility and power.\n\nAny locality in America, of whatever size, would be rocked by a police shooting. It\u2019s notable, all the same, how the Buttigieg town hall was a classic, hyperlocal community meeting. Such events are one of the marvels of the American republic. But this wasn\u2019t a local official, a governor or a mayor, grappling with a terror attack or a natural disaster. It was Mayor Pete presiding over a meeting that any member of a local community board is intimately familiar with.\n\nSure, Barack Obama didn\u2019t have much experience, and no executive experience, but he\u2019d ascended through the Illinois Senate to the U.S. Senate. Trump had zero political experience. But not everyone can be a black swan.\n\nTrump probably showed that if you are going to be a black swan, it helps to go all the way \u2014 Trump came from outside politics, whereas Mayor Pete is an ambitious politician from central casting, class valedictorian in high school, president of the Harvard Institute of Politics, mayor at age 29, whose audacity consists of running for president before he has occupied any office of real consequence.\n\nAt the town hall, the hostility of some of the black residents toward Buttigieg was remarkable, underlining his lack of African American backing in the primaries. In a May poll in South Carolina, Buttigieg was at 18 percent among whites and zero percent among blacks. The disparity was greater in an Indiana poll that had him at 25 percent among whites and also zero percent among blacks.\n\nAmong whites, Buttigieg tends to run a little like Bernie Sanders, far behind Joe Biden, but strong compared with the rest of the pack; among blacks, he runs a little like Kirsten Gillibrand or another laggard candidate, hardly registering.\n\nButtigieg doesn\u2019t have the long history with African Americans of Biden or the cultural connection of a Southern pol like Bill Clinton. And blacks aren\u2019t moved by his progressivism in a technocratic guise.\n\nHis support is clustered among wealthy, white Democrats who are very liberal. This is an important part of the Democratic Party, but not a broad enough coalition to win the nomination. Buttigieg, with a moderate mien, a narrative that emphases the important of place (he went home to his native South Bend), Midwest roots and some technocratic successes as mayor, would seem perfect on paper to reach out beyond the woke white element of the party. This isn\u2019t how he\u2019s running, though.\n\nA glowing (of course) profile in Vogue remarked that \u201cparadoxically, Buttigieg seems to stir keenest excitement among the tapped-in coastal latte set.\u201d Yet this isn\u2019t paradoxical at all \u2014 these are Buttigieg\u2019s people, and his base.\n\nIf Buttigieg actually won the nomination, it\u2019d be because he\u2019d found a way to broaden his appeal. But he\u2019d still project to have real general-election vulnerabilities, suited neither to recapturing working-class, Obama-to-Trump voters, nor to juicing African American turnout.\n\nBe that as it may, and whatever his struggles back in South Bend, Buttigieg is going to come out of this with a hell of a collection of press clippings.", "description": "The elite media fell in love with Buttigieg, not just because he\u2019s genuinely talented, but because he\u2019s the type of candidate  it always falls in love with.", "authors": ["Rich Lowry"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5f/bb/095532374232a07d4b6506e7904e/19626-pete-buttigeig-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-26"}
