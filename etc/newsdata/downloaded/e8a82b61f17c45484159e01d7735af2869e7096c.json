REUTERS/Staff\n\nEurope\u2019s main bourses had initially stuttered but muscled 0.7% higher after China said it was in close communication with Washington and preparing to make progress in upcoming trade talks.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump had stoked trade hopes on Wednesday when he told reporters the two sides were having \u201cgood conversations\u201d and that an agreement \u201ccould happen sooner than you think\u201d.\n\nThe euro hitting a 28-month low EUR= also helped euro zone bond markets as traders chewed over the third German resignation from the European Central Bank's board since 2011.\n\nIt had amplified doubts around the sustainability of the bank\u2019s aggressive stimulus measures \u2014 Germany, France and the Netherlands have all voiced criticism \u2014 but after a brief early wobble, bond yields went 1-2 basis points lower. DE10YT=RR, FR10YT=RR, NL10YT=RR.\n\nThe major currencies barely budged either, having become largely inured to the constant toing and froing of the more-than year-long trade war.\n\nJust on Tuesday, Trump had sharply criticised China in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, where he said he would not accept a \u201cbad deal\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think the trade talks will take years if it ever has a solution,\u201d Makor Capital Markets strategist, St\u00e9phane Barbier de la Serre, said.\n\n\u201cTo me, what we see (today) is just market expectations, it is purely micro management of the market, nothing else.

Mexico is expected to slice its 8% rate by a similar amount later too.\n\nMuch of the rest of Asia had lacked clear direction.
