The four-year-old startup said it has 800 employees and plans to expand its U.S. team from 17 to more than 100 in the next year.\n\nZilingo, which has raised $308 million in funding and is valued at about $970 million, says it aims to speed apparel sourcing by digitizing entrenched manual processes and eliminating some of the middlemen that can eat into companies\u2019 profit margins.\n\nThe garment trade has long relied on sourcing agents and supply-chain managers to connect Western retailers and brands with factories in Asia and elsewhere. \u201cThe idea is to make it easier for brands to source and sell,\u201d Zilingo Chief Executive and co-founder Ankiti Bose said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not like electronics. There is zero technology in the factories, no SAP, Oracle. \u2026 There is nothing tailor-made for the apparel industry.\u201d The company\u2019s supply-chain platform gives suppliers and brands access to technology such as financing, invoicing and inventory management tools. It also provides auditing and compliance services and predictive analytics to help companies respond quickly to trends. \u201cWe marry that with the capabilities in the factories that we have,\u201d Ms. Bose said. For example, if trend data indicates a \u201cwhite ruffled sleeve is going to sell,\u201d she said, Zilingo\u2019s platform will tell you \u201cif you want to get it to that celebrity or that brand within 21 days, it should be made in Line 3 in Bangladesh in Factory X.\u201d Founded in 2015 as an e-commerce marketplace to help small producers and brands to reach consumers in Southeast Asia, the company expanded its focus to sourcing and supply-chain services the following year. About 60,000 retailers and 6,000 factories are on Zilingo\u2019s platform, the company said, with most suppliers based in Asian countries outside of China and some in Western countries including Portugal and the U.S. Write to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
