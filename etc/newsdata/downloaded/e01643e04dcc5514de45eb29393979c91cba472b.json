At some point, Alexander was able to call his wife, who in turn called EMS. They soon arrived and brought him to the Baxter Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at the hospital.\n\nAuthorities have not yet determined the precise role the deer played in his death.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sure that he died from the deer. It could have been other medical issues,\u201d Keith Stephens, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission said in an email sent to TIME. \u201cThe hospital did note that he had several puncture wounds.\u201d\n\nStephens also noted that hunters are encouraged to wait at least 30 minutes after they shoot a deer to approach it.\n\n\u201cThen, check if you can see whether [the] deer is breathing by watching the chest area,\u201d Stephens says.\n\nAn incident like this has not happened before in northern Arkansas, according to Stephens, although in 2016 a deer gored a hunter in Ashley County, in South Arkansas.", "description": "The attack happened around 6:30 p.m. October 24 when Thomas Alexander, 66, was hunting in Marion County, Ark. and shot a buck with his muzzleloader, which is a firearm that is loaded from the front of its barrel", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/z6yQQ.ab1bqCgTcsy6rGLA--~B/aD0xNDE0O3c9MjEyMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/18dd6405bc25f7c39f45b729ee48e40a", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
