(AP) - KJ Hamler\u2019s juking, high-stepping, highlight-reel performance a week ago earned him praise from coaches and teammates.\n\nPenn State\u2019s star receiver knows he can catch more than six passes for 108 yards in a game and points to his 58-yard touchdown catch and run against Maryland.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think last game was a big game,\u201d Hamler said. \u201cI think it was average. I feel like there\u2019s always something to improve on, and I think I still have a lot to improve.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll get a chance Saturday when No. 12 Penn State (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) hosts Purdue (1-3, 0-1).\n\nPenn State coach James Franklin plans to feed Hamler against a defense that\u2019s been among the worst in the country. The Boilermakers are allowing 451 yards and 33 points per game.\n\n\u201cThe more touches the better,\u201d Franklin said.\n\nBut for Hamler to get more opportunities, Penn State\u2019s offense needs to stay on the field. That hasn\u2019t been easy despite the Nittany Lions\u2019 gaudy point totals.\n\nThrough the first three weeks of the season, they hadn\u2019t converted more than 31% of their third downs in a game. Franklin saw a turnaround with success on 69% last week against Maryland.\n\nHamler, whose 29 total touches are 10 more than he had at this point last season, does most of his work on first and second down. That\u2019s where he\u2019s caught all but two of his 16 receptions.\n\nPurdue coach Jeff Brohm will try to limit Hamler\u2019s touches by keeping him off the field. But he realizes Penn State\u2019s defense will make that much tougher.\n\nOnly nine teams have forced more punts than Penn State so far.\n\n\u201cIt starts with their defense,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cWhen you shut teams out, when you have some of the personnel that they have, when you look across the board at where they are at, when you watch them on video, man, they play hard, they go hard. They attack.\u201d\n\nBANGED UP\n\nHamler is among those disappointed to learn injured Purdue star Rondale Moore won\u2019t suit up. Moore\u2019s dynamic playmaking skills would make life much more difficult for Hamler\u2019s teammates, but Hamler sees Purdue\u2019s do-it-all receiver as a challenge.\n\nMoore suffered a leg injury last week on the same play that starting quarterback Elijah Sindelar broke his collarbone. Although Moore is expected to return at some point, Sindelar is likely out for the season.\n\n\u201cI wish he would\u2019ve played,\u201d Hamler said. \u201cIt probably would\u2019ve been like the battle of the slots. I hope he\u2019s doing well.\u201d\n\nOPPORTUNITY\n\nMoore had already accounted for 387 yards and two touchdowns on 32 offensive touches. His absence creates an opportunity for either Jackson Anthrop or TJ Sheffield to work out of the slot.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, they\u2019ll draw coverage from Penn State\u2019s John Reid, who\u2019s been the Nittany Lions best coverage man.\n\nBANGED UP\n\nPurdue lost linebacker Markus Bailey for the season to a knee injury earlier this year and linebacker Lorenzo Neal is also expected to miss this game.\n\nThe Boilermakers also will be without running backs Tario Fuller and Richie Worship, offensive lineman D.J. Washington and wideout Jared Sparks.\n\nNEW DUDS\n\nThe Nittany Lions will wear throwback uniforms for the second time in three seasons, a rare occurrence for a program that rarely steers away from its classic blue and white scheme.\n\nAlthough the slight changes might be tough to spot - there will be numbers on helmets and a blue stripe down the white pants - one stands out. The Nittany Lions will swap out their usual black cleats for shiny white ones.\n\nHamler, who redshirted when the team wore the uniforms in 2017, is looking forward to getting his a little dirty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to play in them and just have my sweet feet on,\u201d Hamler said. \u201cI feel faster in white cleats.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "KJ Hamler's juking, high-stepping, highlight-reel performance a week ago earned him praise from coaches and teammates.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Travis Johnson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/penn_st_maryland_football_15490_c0-168-3996-2497_s1770x1032.jpg?b864f4ff6661d7096f3ff273f41887384feb5af1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
