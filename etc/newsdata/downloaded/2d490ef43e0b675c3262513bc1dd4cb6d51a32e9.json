It was started by Elton Jantjies inside the Springbok 22. The flyhalf produced an inch-perfect kick-pass for wing Warrick Gelant, who evaded DTH van der Merwe, and sprinted into the Canadian half.\n\nDamian de Allende offered support to keep the move going and in turn spun a pass to Reinach, who breezed under the posts to complete his hat-trick with barely 20 minutes of this RWC 2019 Pool B match played.\n\nAlso nominated are tries by Charles Ollivon for France against Wales in the quarter-final; Sergio Parisse for Italy in a warm-up match against Russia, and TJ Perenara for New Zealand against Namibia.\n\nInternational Rugby Players\u2019 representative Conrad Smith, the former All Black and Rugby World Cup winner who chaired the Try of the Year panel, said: \u201cThere were some excellent scores this year and our job to pick a shortlist was a difficult one.\n\n\u201cFrom the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Six Nations in early 2019 all the way through to the Rugby World Cup in Japan, we saw some amazing efforts during the year.\n\n\u201cThese tries really are a testament to the quality of international rugby and the skills on display out there and this sparked some great debate among the panel.\u201d\n\nPREVIOUS WINNERS:\n\n2018: Brodie Retallick (New Zealand) - New Zealand v Australia\n\n2017: Joaqu\u00edn Tuculet (Argentina) - Argentina v England\n\n2016: Jamie Heaslip (Ireland) - Ireland v Italy\n\n2015: Julian Savea (New Zealand) - New Zealand v France\n\n2014: Francois Hougaard (South Africa) - South Africa v New Zealand\n\n2013: Beauden Barrett (New Zealand) - New Zealand v France\n\n2012: Bryan Habana (South Africa) - South Africa v New Zealand\n\n2011: Radike Samo (Australia) - Australia v New Zealand\n\n2010: Chris Ashton (England) - England v Australia\n\n2009: Jaque Fourie (South Africa) - South Africa v British & Irish Lions\n\n2008: Brian O\u2019Driscoll (Ireland) - Australia v Ireland\n\n2007: Takudzwa Ngwenya (USA) - South Africa v USA", "description": "Cobus Reinach\u2019s hat-trick try against Canada at the 2019 Rugby World Cup has been nominated for the International Rugby Players Try of the Year 2019 award.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9446/937f356f56874c8b9d206e098484b6d2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
