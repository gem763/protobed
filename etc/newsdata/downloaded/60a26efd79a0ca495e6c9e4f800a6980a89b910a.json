A statement added that all the arrests were on suspicion of conspiracy to commit a public nuisance and that there had been no breach of airport security.\n\nDespite its failure to disrupt flights, a spokesperson for Heathrow Pause said the action had triggered \u201ca sensible, honest conversation throughout society on the dangerous folly of Heathrow expansion, with the ultimate objective of cancelling the third runway\u201d.\n\nActivists said at least one drone had been flown successfully, and that they planned to continue attempting to fly drones at head height within the airport exclusion zone over the weekend.\n\nOne of those arrested on Friday morning, James Brown, said he had been left with no other choice but to protest. Speaking before his arrest, he said: \u201cEven though parliament has formally recognised the climate emergency we are facing, our own government is still pursuing plans to build a third runway at Heathrow,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis hypocrisy, and the general negligence of the aviation industry to face up to its contribution to the climate emergency, has forced me into considering arrest and, if necessary, imprisonment, to wake people up to the dire situation we are in.\u201d\n\nPolice made seven pre-emptive arrests of activists including Roger Hallam, a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion.\n\nThe protests mark the start of what is likely to be an upturn in environmental activism over the coming weeks. Extinction Rebellion protesters held a die-in at the start of London fashion week on Friday, and millions of people around the world are expected to take part in the climate school strikes next Friday. Extinction Rebellion are also planning weeks of mass civil disobedience in London in October.\n\nHistory will be kind to Heathrow climate protesters who stop us flying | George Monbiot Read more\n\nIt will also be a crucial time for world leaders with key environmental gatherings planned in New York and Chile before the end of the year.\n\nAt Heathrow, protesters had planned to fly drones away from flight paths at no higher than about 1.8 metres (6ft). They notified the airport and the authorities of their plans weeks ago and said that once a drone flight was over its pilot would phone the police and wait to be arrested.\n\nThey had believed this would force the authorities to shut down Heathrow\u2019s operations, but a spokesperson for the airport said this assumption was wrong because an ongoing \u201cdynamic risk assessment\u201d would look at each incident on a case-by-case basis.\n\nBefore he was arrested, Hallam said the proposed third runway expansion would \u201cprovide another few years of business as usual, until everything collapses\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are in a \u2018time of consequences\u2019, as Churchill called it in response to the Nazi threat in 1936. The consequence of not rebelling is indescribable suffering and death for billions of people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe consequence of rebellion is a chance to avoid the worst. Rebellion means mass economic disruption and deep personal sacrifice.
