FFS, grow up!'\n\nShe also liked a tweet from a fan, which read: 'I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to get lots of nasty messages from people hiding behind a keyboard or a phone, you have a decision to make and you made it, people may not agree (myself included) but that is why your in that seat. Don\u2019t let the haters get to you'.\n\nAnd fellow judge Craig Revel Horwood also leapt to Shirley's defence, insisting viewers are to blame for Catherine and Johannes exit.\n\nSad: Shirley failed to raise a smile as she strolled to the park with her beloved pooch Charlie to meet her friend Karen\n\nCosy: Shirley wrapped up in a blue furry coat, bobble hat and black trousers\n\nUnder pressure: Hours earlier, Shirley defended her decision to eliminate Catherine on Twitter as she hit back at the trolls and liked tweets about how angry viewers should 'grow up'\n\nUpset: The television personality looked glum as she took time out from the walk to sit on a bench and gaze down at her phone\n\nFurious: Shirley faced the wrath from viewers following Sunday's show, with many calling for her to be sacked after her controversial decision\n\nHe told fans: 'If you\u2019re that worried about it, vote. You can only judge what you see in that one minute thirty, and in my opinion, Mike had the cleaner dance.\n\n'It\u2019s quite simple and you know if it was another day or if Catherine was doing a rumba for instance, against his tango, then she would have won it. But you know it\u2019s what happens on the day.'\n\nThe Nativity Rocks! star went on to insist viewers are just as to blame as the panel - which consists of Craig, Shirley, Bruno Tonioli and new judge Motsi Mabuse.\n\nIn his typical candid fashion, he hit out: 'It\u2019s not just the judges, we have 50% of the vote so I blame the people that aren\u2019t voting.\n\nAbuse: One tweet Shirley liked said: 'Seeing the vitriol aimed at Shirley Ballas tonight by #strictly viewers who are - I presume - supposed to be adults is really quite sickening'\n\nAttacked: Mike and Katya have also faced backlash for being saved with fans saying 'good dancers are being rejected instead of the duffers'\n\nBold: Fellow judge Craig Revel Horwood also leapt to Shirley's defence, insisting viewers are to blame for Catherine and Johannes exit\n\nSupportive: However, others defended the retired professional dancer and praised her wealth of experience in the industry\n\n'You can ask, they\u2019ll all whinge online and be abusive and then you ask them \"did you vote?\" and they say \"oh no I didn\u2019t vote\"... so if you\u2019re that worried about it, vote!\n\n'Catherine leaving seems to be great controversy \u2013 but it\u2019s not, it was the right decision. You never know what dance you\u2019re going to get or who the audience are going to vote for.\n\nOn the backlash Mike has received, the TV star said: 'Trolling on Twitter is crazy... people self-publishing on Twitter should not be self-publishing. It's often disgusting, terrible! He is in a competition, his tango was better, that\u2019s the end of it.'\n\nTrolls: She also liked a tweet which read: 'I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to get lots of nasty messages from people hiding behind a keyboard or a phone, you have a decision to make and you made'\n\nShirley faced the wrath from viewers following Sunday's show, with many calling for her to be sacked after her controversial decision.\n\nOne wrote: 'Shirley should be sacked we all know she has her favourites at least Len was always fair in his judging. #Strictly'.'\n\nAnother fan of the show added: I think Shirley made up her mind who she wanted to send home even before they danced again.

Aren't the judges supposed to consider future potential?'.\n\nFeeling the scrutiny: Shirley cut a solemn figure as she walked Charlie who happily trotted alongside her\n\nDrama: Mike Bushell and his wife Emily also had to hit back at trolls on Twitter who have slammed the BBC Breakfast presenter after he was saved by Shirley\n\nA third chimed: 'The elimination of @Cath_Tyldesley from #Strictly was a travesty. Shirley Ballas must go. Bring back Len Goodman!'\n\nA fourth added: 'The head judge Shirley Ballas has ruined Strictly with her absurd judgement. The viewers do not need to be expert to see the show is fixed and good dancers are being rejected instead of the duffers.'\n\nHowever, others defended the retired professional dancer, one wrote: 'I\u2019m sure some people will rip into Shirley for saving Mike, they\u2019ll say \"time to get her off Strictly\". She is the most qualified of the 4 Judges, she knows what she\u2019s talking about. Catherine made more mistakes at the end of the day.'\n\nBBC's Dan Walker added: 'Fully understand that people loved watching @Cath_Tyldesley & @jojo_radebe on #Strictly but some of the abuse aimed at @mikebreakfast @Mrs_katjones & @ShirleyBallas is cruel and ridiculous. Shirley is doing her job and Mike & Katya are simply trying their best. Roll on next week'.", "description": "Shirley Ballas cut a solemn figure as she walked her beloved dog Charlie on Monday,\u00a0 hours after her controversial decision to send Catherine Tyldesley home on Strictly", "authors": ["Connie Rusk For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/14/20281720-0-image-a-11_1572271255113.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
