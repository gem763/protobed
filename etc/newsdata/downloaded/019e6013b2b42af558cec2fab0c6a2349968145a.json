She possessed impossibly quick hands and reactions, with particular penchant for a leg-side stumping. She leaves the international arena having helped the team lift two World Cups (in 2009 and 2017) and a T20 World Cup (2009), and was named ICC Women\u2019s Cricketer of the Year three times.\n\n\u201cSarah can be immensely proud of everything she has achieved in an England shirt, and of everything she has done for the women\u2019s game,\u201d Clare Connor, Managing Director of Women\u2019s Cricket for the ECB, said.\n\n\u201cShe is someone that young people can look up to, for her achievements and talent on the pitch \u2013 but also for her bravery and resilience off it. She has come through significant adversity and performed on the world stage for her country.\n\n\u201cWe are very grateful to Sarah for her contributions to English cricket over the last 13 years. She has become a powerful voice within women\u2019s sport and I\u2019m sure she will make a success of the next stage of her professional life. We all wish her the very best.\u201d\n\nTaylor has publicly spoken of her battles with anxiety, and took an extended break from the game in 2016.\n\nMore recently she missed the T20 World Cup last year, and a portion of this summer\u2019s Ashes,\n\n\u201cThe England girls are role models on and off the field, and they have undoubtedly inspired \u2013 and will continue to inspire \u2013 so many young people to take up the game, girls and boys,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the heights that this team can reach.\n\n\u201cI am extremely proud of my career. I leave with my head held high and with excitement for what my future holds and what my next chapter brings.\u201d", "description": "England\u00a0wicket-keeper Sarah Taylor has announced her retirement from international cricket.
