She\u2019s the best candidate running today and she comes at it with joy and with sincerity and with a wealth of knowledge and experience.\"\n\n\"Honestly, I don\u2019t comprehend why guys hate women so much sometimes,\" Legend replied. \"You see someone as transparently competent and eloquent and on fire as Elizabeth Warren and then you hear some guys just are not into voting for a woman. Why do guys feel so threatened by the idea of a woman president?\"\n\n\"Our menses,\" Teigen whispered. \"Because there\u2019s 10 days a month where we\u2019re just going to war.\"\n\nTheir Twitter spat with Trump is commemorated with a framed tweet in their home.\n\nBack in September, the president unloaded on Teigen and Legend, calling Legend a \"boring\" singer and Teigen his \"filthy mouthed wife.\" In response, Teigen didn't mince words: \"lol what a p--sy a-- b--ch. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president.\"\n\nThe Twitter exchange made international headlines and prompted one of their friends to frame it as gift to the familiy, which is now in a shadowbox \"in the grand entryway to the family's home in Beverly Hills, on a table crowded with otherwise joyful photos of the couple\u2019s beautiful children and their grand wedding at Lake Como.\"\n\n....musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed. \u201cAnchor\u201d@LesterHoltNBC doesn\u2019t even bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\nlol what a pussy ass bitch. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nBoth Teigen and Legend are a bit conflicted when it comes to pal Kim Kardashian's prison reform work with the president.\n\nThe EGOT-winning star called Kardashian's work with Trump \"a cheap win\" for the commander-in-chief, while admitting that the work is still important.\n\n\"But the people being granted clemency are real people with families,\" he said. \"So even if the clemency is won through his celebrity-whore tendencies, it\u2019s still helpful for that family and that person. At the same time, he\u2019s locking kids in cages and he\u2019s a terrible human being.\"\n\n\"To be able to go in there and put whatever you hate about him aside to do this greater good for this person?\" Teigen added. \"I don\u2019t know if I could physically muster that smile and handshake.\"\n\nLegend joked with former President Barack Obama about how much their respective wives are beloved by the public.\n\nThe \"All of Me\" hitmaker performed at an Obama Foundation event in Oakland this year, where he bonded with the former two-term president about his wife, Teigen, and Obama's wife, Michelle, and how obsessed the internet is with the two women.\n\n\"We joked about how much our wives are loved more than we are now,\" he revealed, before adding that he's \"her biggest cheerleader\" and he \"always [thinks] she should do more.\"\n\nTeigen was offered her own late-night talk show, but she turned down the offer.\n\nThe best-selling cookbook author, who openly struggles with anxiety, thought that the opportunity would've represented \"too much attention and focus on me.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s almost like the more things you do, the closer you are to getting canceled,\" she said. \"It\u2019s so scary to me -- to have the world turn on you and hate you.\"\n\nWhen Legend assured her that she has \"nothing to worry about\" when it comes to being \"canceled,\" Teigen appeared to agree and expressed that she'd still be open to such an opportunity should it be offered to her again.\n\n\"I\u2019m anxious but I still have an ego,\" she said. \"I feel like opportunities will come back to me when I\u2019m more ready and more stable.\"\n\nRead Chrissy Teigen and John Legend's full interview with Vanity Fair here.", "description": "John Legend and Chrissy Teigen opened up about a variety of topics for the December issue of Vanity Fair.", "authors": ["Gibson Johns"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7ofI1WUf5tTZsq641y8DPg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/2845x1865+191+411/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/65ccabb0-f99b-11e9-97ef-17b7425c36f8", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
