I even went to see [the psychiatrist] Steve Peters at one point. But in the end, you know, it just felt like the right time\u2026 Sky were going in a completely different direction with Ineos coming in. I\u2019d been working with Dave [Brailsford] for 18 years, which is incredible really. And you get comfortable don\u2019t you? Fran [Millar, chief executive], Tim [Kerrison] Carsten [Jeppesen, head of technical operations], that whole gang...\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nUltimately, Ellingworth says, it was nothing to do with Sky or Ineos or any of the people there, who he describes as \u201clike family\u201d. \u201cI wasn\u2019t p----d off. It was fine. It was just starting to feel a little bit Groundhog Day. I wasn\u2019t as motivated by the new challenge as I should have been. I needed something new.\u201d\n\nIt has been six months since that decision. Ellingworth, who was initially placed on gardening leave by Sky, has not said anything in public since. But he is back now.\n\nThe 47-year-old officially started work at his new team on Tuesday. And he is clearly brimming with enthusiasm after his summer off. \u201cI never really stopped,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been down in Woking most weeks actually. But I wanted that time. I wanted to spend it with my family, I wanted to step back and really think about what we are trying to achieve here, and then come in and try to bring a lot of energy.\u201d\n\nEllingworth (left) was a trusted confidant and mentor for many riders at Team Sky Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe cycling world is going to be interested to see how he fares.\n\nStory continues\n\nEllingworth has already proven himself as a coach and, arguably even more so, as a man-manager; a friend and mentor to countless riders.\n\nIt was Ellingworth who set up the British Cycling academy programme in 2004; who oversaw the fledgling careers of riders from Mark Cavendish to Geraint Thomas to Ed Clancy. It remains to be seen, though, how a figure once described by Cavendish as \u201cthe most undervalued person in British Cycling\u201d gets on as the main man. Without Brailsford above him, without that family around him.\n\nEllingworth is well aware of the risk he has taken in stepping away from Sky. He wanted the challenge, though. To see whether he could lead a team.\n\nPlans are already well advanced. Ellingworth has made a number of signings. Roger Hammond, the former national champion and Dimension Data sporting director, is joining as performance manager. Tim Harris, a familiar face in the sport, is joining as development director, scouting and looking after the younger riders. Brent Copeland will be staying as operations director.\n\nMikel Landa and Wout Poels are already confirmed on the rider roster, replacing the outgoing Vincenzo Nibali. There are likely to be further announcements soon. Cavendish is expected to be unveiled any day, although Ellingworth will not say anything on the matter.\n\nNor will he say much about Rohan Dennis, the Australian world time trial champion who has taken the team to a tribunal after they terminated his contract last month. (\u201cOne thing I will say is I wanted Rohan to stay,\u201d Ellingworth says. \u201cHe was definitely a part of my long-term plans so I\u2019m disappointed at the way things have panned out.\u201d\n\nEllingworth won't have Rohan Dennis to call on at his new team after the Australian world time trial champion had his contract terminated Credit: REX\n\nPerhaps the biggest signing of all, though, at least according to Ellingworth, is Duncan Bradley of McLaren Applied Technologies. Bradley is going to be working on the project full time as technical director, having been more of a consultant during the first year of the McLaren partnership.\n\n\u201cHe is very much one of the reasons I wanted to get involved,\u201d Ellingworth says. \u201cIf you want an innovation hub then McLaren Applied Technologies is one of the best in the world. And Duncan is MAT. Ron [Dennis] brought him in. I see him as absolutely critical to our potential success. He\u2019s a massive asset for us. Not just on the aero side but in terms of getting from a to b as fast as you can. Every element.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we need to be clever,\u201d he adds of how the team can leverage the McLaren partnership. \u201cIt would be easy to scattergun, to say, \u2018Oh let\u2019s build a new carbon-fibre composite component\u2019 or, \u2018Let\u2019s use McLaren\u2019s wind tunnel\u2019. But it\u2019s about where we can make the biggest difference. I think we use McLaren for the really top-end stuff. Take our time and make sure there are clear goals and outcomes. But it\u2019s exciting. The McLaren brand is special, it\u2019s iconic.\u201d\n\nEllingworth says he is not setting any hard and fast targets. Perhaps mindful of the rod Team Sky created for themselves in 2009 \u2013 and the noses they put out of joint \u2013 he says he wants to discuss his goals with the team first.\n\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019ve no problem in saying that I want this team to become a grand tour-winning team,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd yes, that means a Tour de France-winning team.\u201d For now, it\u2019s about \u201cbuilding the culture, getting to know each other, canvassing views\u201d.\n\nEllingworth (L) during his time at Team Sky Credit: GETTY IMAGES\n\nEllingworth, who will not move his family from Whaley Bridge but instead plans on travelling to Woking \u201cmost weeks\u201d, says he wants to be hands-on, involved in everything. At every race, at least initially. \u201cI made the decision with Jane, my wife,\u201d he says. \u201cWe decided if I was going to do it I needed to go full gas. It\u2019s not easy on her. We\u2019ve got three kids [aged seven, four and one]. But she understands the game. She understands that I love it as well.\u201d\n\nPre-season begins in December, when the team will go to Croatia. There\u2019s another camp in Spain in January. \u201cThen [to altitude in] Tenerife over the next year,\u201d he says. Following the Sky model? \u201cI\u2019m a product of my background,\u201d he nods. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to walk in and say, \u2018This is how you do it\u2019. I want to build the culture over the next 12-18 months.\u201d\n\nIt needs building. Bahrain-Merida have not been without controversy in the first 2\u00bd years of their existence. One of their riders, Kanstantsin Siutsou, was suspended last year for EPO, while the team had to pull another, Kristijan Koren, out of the Giro d\u2019Italia earlier this year, and provisionally suspend assistant sports director Borut Bozic, after they were named in connection with a doping probe. Both their cases allegedly took place long before they joined the team.\n\nEllingworth knows what it is like to be in the eye of the storm. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t regret a moment,\u201d he says of the last 10 years. \u201cAfter all the ups and downs \u2013 and there were a lot of downs \u2013 we learnt. It was a different team at the end to how it started out. We had to learn everything from scratch, how the pro scene worked, how that world worked. I feel like I\u2019ve had an incredible experience. They gave a lot to me, but I also gave a lot of myself. I don\u2019t know any other way.\u201d", "description": "After 18 years, it was always going to be a wrench leaving. \u201cOh, I really agonised over it,\u201d Rod Ellingworth says of his decision, taken in April, to quit Team Sky and accept an offer from McLaren to run their new joint venture with Bahrain-Merida.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/E8omAhY3o9CfB9rG0gkbXA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aSfGBpKTcoH598bHdT3KOA--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/8ce342c6005f0be95ee0ff5093454aea", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
