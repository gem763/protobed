It is important to normalize sharing pronouns while never forcing anyone to disclose their pronouns. It can also be helpful to emphasize that pronouns do not indicate someone\u2019s gender identity and that students shouldn\u2019t assume someone\u2019s gender identity based on pronouns. When the instructor introduces themselves with their pronouns first, it can normalize the experience and set an inclusive and culturally sensitive tone.\n\nThe guide discourages announcing a student\u2019s birth name in class \u201cbecause this can be an embarrassing and uncomfortable situation for TGD students who have changed their name.\u201d\n\nThe committee offers the following \u201cshort sample script\u201d for professors to begin a class:\n\nHello everyone! Welcome! To start off today, we are going to do introductions. Please introduce yourself by stating your preferred name, gender pronouns if you feel comfortable doing so, and year/major. Your gender pronouns might be she/her/hers, he/him/his, they/them/their, or something else. It\u2019s important that we all use the correct pronouns when referring to others. I\u2019ll start by introducing myself. My name is _____ and I use (she/her/hers, he/him/his, they/them/their) pronouns. I\u2019m a faculty member in the counseling psychology department\u2026\n\nThe guide displays a table of terms that reflect biological differences \u2013 which the authors recommend to avoid \u2013 versus the committee\u2019s preferred gender-inclusive terms:\n\nThe authors of the guide recommend individuals \u201cpractice using they/them as singular pronouns on a regular basis,\u201d even though such usage may be grammatically incorrect:\n\n\u201cFor example, \u2018They are a student in my class,\u2019\u201d the committee suggests. \u201cOr, \u2018Each student should sign up for a presentation date before they finish the book.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is hard to relearn the use of this pronoun, which is why practice is essential!\u201d APAGS states.\n\nThe guide also recommends expanding \u201coptions on demographic forms, applications, etc.\u201d to reflect transgender ideology.\n\nA sample form instructs asking the individual for \u201clegal name\u201d and \u201cpreferred name.\u201d Instead of sex \u2013 male or female \u2013 the guide suggests the question, \u201cWhat sex were you assigned at birth?\u201d and provide the choices of \u201cfemale, male, or intersex.\u201d\n\nIndividuals completing a form might also be asked, \u201cWhich best describes your current gender identity?\u201d The options provided are:\n\nCisgender (non-transgender) Woman/Girl\n\nCisgender (non-transgender) Man/Boy\n\nTransgender Woman/Girl\n\nTransgender Man/Boy\n\nNon-binary\n\nGenderqueer\n\nGender fluid\n\nAgender (non-gender, neutrois)\n\nPolygender (third gender)\n\nIndigenous/other culturally-specific gender minority (e.g., two-spirit, hijra, m\u0101h\u016b, etc.)\n\nAnother identity\n\nThe guide also instructs university psychology departments to \u201cinclude trans and queer authors on syllabi,\u201d and to \u201ccenter queer and trans people of color (QTPOC) in discussions about transness.\u201d", "description": "An APA guide instructs how to end language referring to biological differences among individuals and replace it with transgender terminology.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/02/wi/ap/23/18nqmh3-e1503690356473.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
