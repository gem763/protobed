In a tweet by Browns beat writer Nate Ulrich of the Akron Beacon Journal, Beckham said he has been longing to play for a dynasty such as the Patriots. \"Two, 3 years ago, there was speculation that was going on and I was willing and ready to go over there at any point in time,\u201d Beckham said, referring to a possible trade while he was with the New York Giants.\n\n\u201cThat was always a dream of mine to play for Tom Brady,\u201d added Beckham, who was picked 12th overall by the Giants in the 2014 NFL Draft. In a tweet, Keith Britton of 92.3 The Fan said Beckham admitted that he talked with Brady about the possibility of playing together at some point in their respective careers. In 2018, there were reports about a possible trade involving Beckham to the Patriots, but it never materialized.\n\nThis offseason, the Giants decided to part ways with Beckham after five years and traded him to the Cleveland Browns. With a dynamic quarterback in Baker Mayfield and a talented receiver such as Beckham, the Browns were expected to contend for the Super Bowl this season. However, the Browns have been a disappointment, recording just a 2-4 record with Beckham tallying just 29 receptions for 436 yards and one touchdown.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

NFL New England Patriots\n\nThe Browns are in for a tough time against the Patriots, especially their defense, in their Sunday\u2019s clash at Gillette Stadium. The Patriots entered the week as a 12.5-point favorite over the Browns following their 33-0 demolition of AFC East rival New York Jets on Monday Night Football (MNF).\n\nBeckham reveals Belichick\u2019s advice\n\nJim Trotter of ESPN reported that Beckham also shared the pre-game advice of Patriots head coach Bill Belichick.\n\nAccording to Beckham, Belichick told him to enjoy the day because \u201cthere's not going to be much for you.\u201d Beckham will play the Patriots for just the second time in his career. In their first meeting in 2015, Beckham caught an 87-yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning, before the Patriots limited him to just 17 yards the rest of the way en route to a 27-26 win.\n\nBelichick wary of Mayfield\u2019s abilities\n\nDespite Mayfield\u2019s struggles this season, Belichick is still wary of the young quarterback\u2019s abilities to pull off a surprise against the Patriots.\n\nThis season, Mayfield has thrown for 1,496 yards and five touchdowns with a league-leading 11 interceptions. \"Good arm, can make all the throws, moves the ball down the field with a good touch,\u201d Belichick said of the Browns\u2019 second-year signal-caller. Mayfield will be in for a lot of trouble as the Patriots\u2019 defense has allowed just 6.9 points per game with NFL-best 18 interceptions.", "description": "Beckham admitted that he talked with Tom Brady about the possibility of playing together.", "authors": ["Zeegee Cecilio", "Read More On The Same Topic Zeegee Cecilio", "Devin Mccourty Shades Teammate Edelman", "Claims Sanu Is The Patriots", "Best-Throwing Wideout", "Tom Brady Talks About Arrival Of Wide Receiver Mohamed Sanu", "Future With Patriots", "Analysts", "Key Acquisitions Sanu", "Bethel To Help Patriots Reach Super Bowl Anew"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/24/os/b_1200x630/beckham-said-he-has-been-longing-to-play-for-a-dynasty-image-credit-cleveland-brownsyoutube_2343911.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
