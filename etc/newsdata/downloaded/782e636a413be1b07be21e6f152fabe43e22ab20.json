I explain the clash here.\n\nThe conflict:\n\nBoth the administration and Democratic lawmakers have proposed plans to overhaul the federal housing finance system and expand affordable housing, some of which include broad overlap.\n\nHousing affordability is a top priority of Waters, who is from Los Angeles, where homelessness rose 12 percent last year.\n\nYet despite those shared concerns, Democrats and administration officials appeared to lack the trust necessary to break a decade-long stalemate on housing finance.\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed steps to overhaul the housing finance system, including forcing Fannie and Freddie to boost capital reserves and reduce their footprint before releasing them to the private sector.\n\nSuch steps would not need congressional approval but wouldn\u2019t address the potential harm that could come from abruptly pulling crucial federal support for low-income housing.\n\nON TAP TOMORROW\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\nDemocrats jump into Trump turf war over student loans: The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is facing growing pressure from liberal critics to challenge another Trump agency, the Department of Education, and crack down on abusive student lending practices.\n\nThe pressure is putting Kraninger in a difficult spot. I explain why here.\n\nThe issue:\n\nThe context:\n\nThe CFPB and Education Department have sparred over who is in charge of handling fraud in the nation's student loan industry since DeVos's confirmation as Education secretary in 2017.\n\nWhile DeVos's department is responsible for holding the roughly $1.5 trillion in federal student loans, the CFPB is charged with policing loan servicers -- including federal contractors -- for consumer fraud and abuse.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, the two cooperated to oversee complaints of abusive practices against companies contracted by the federal government to collect student loans, such as Navient.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the Education Department canceled an information-sharing agreement with the CFPB in 2017, telling the bureau it \"takes exception\" to the agency \"unilaterally expanding its oversight role to include the Department's contracted federal loan servicers.\"\n\nHouse passes bill taking aim at anonymous shell companies: The House on Tuesday passed legislation aimed at cracking down on the use of anonymous shell companies for illicit activities.\n\nThe bill passed by a vote of 249-173. Twenty-five Republicans joined most Democrats in voting for the bill, while five Democrats voted against it. The Hill's Naomi Jagoda breaks it down here.\n\nUnder the bill, certain corporations and limited liability companies would be required to disclose their true owners to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) at the time the companies are formed.\n\nThey'd also have to submit annual filings with FinCEN listing their current true owners and any changes to ownership. There would be penalties for people who intentionally submit fraudulent or incomplete information.\n\nThe disclosure requirements don't apply to companies that have more than 20 employees and $5 million in gross receipts, because these companies are less likely to be anonymous shell companies.\n\nGOOD TO KNOW\n\nODDS AND ENDS", "description": "Happy Tuesday and welcome back to On The Money.
