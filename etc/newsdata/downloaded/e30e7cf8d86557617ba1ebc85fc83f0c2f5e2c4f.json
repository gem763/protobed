The tablet then breaks away into three arms tipped with 1mm microneedles which latch on to the intestinal wall\n\nHe added the research team 'look forward to hopefully seeing it help people with diabetes and others in the future'.\n\nTests of the capsule on pigs showed it releases a comparable amount of insulin to that of an injection.\n\nPatients who suffer with type 1 diabetes do not naturally produce enough insulin from their pancreas to bring down their level of blood sugar.\n\nTherefore, they need daily doses of the hormone to counterbalance this amount of glucose.\n\nInsulin is not typically prescribed for patients of type 2 diabetes - which is linked with obesity - because their bodies are able to naturally produce the hormone.\n\nAn x-ray shows the sealed capsule (left) passing into the small intestine where it then splits open into three arms (right)\n\nThe paper was published in the journal Nature Medicine. The researchers will now look to trial the capsules on humans.\n\nCo-author Giovanni Traverso, an assistant professor at MIT, said the inspiration behind the team's work was to rid diabetes patients of the frustration of having to shove a needle inside them every day.\n\nCapsules have always been shunned because they cannot survive the journey through the stomach, which stores liquid with a pH of 1.5 to 3.5.\n\nThis means it breaks apart in the stomach and releases its insulin load at the wrong point.\n\nBut the team's protective capsule will break apart when it reaches the small intestine's higher pH level of around 6.\n\nHow does the insulin pill work? 1. A diabetes sufferer swallows the 30mm capsule. 2. The capsule passes down the esophagus and into the stomach, where is is protected from the acid by a tough polymer coating. 3. The pill then enters the small intestine where the organ's ph 6 conditions cause the polymer layer to break away. 4. The capsule then unfolds into three arms, each tipped with 1mm microneedles. 5. The microneedles latch on to the intestinal wall and administer the insulin into the bloodstream. 6. The capsule completely dissolves within several hours.\n\nThe three arms have been designed so that they are sturdy enough to insert the microneedles but still able to dissolve within several hours.\n\nThe team, who were backed by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, hopes to expand the drug to carry other hormones and enzymes.\n\nAssistant professor Traverso said: 'We can deliver insulin, but we see applications for many other therapeutics and possibly vaccines.\n\n'We're working very closely with our collaborators to identify the next steps and applications where we can have the greatest impact.'\n\nRoughly eight percent of the UK's 4million diabetes patients suffer from Type 1.\n\nWhile Type 2 diabetes is caused by an unhealthy lifestyle, it is still unclear what triggers Type 1 as 85 per cent of people diagnosed have no family history of the condition.\n\nDr Faye Riley, research communications officer at Diabetes UK, said: 'Finding a way that would allow people with diabetes to take insulin orally could be a real benefit for millions, so it's exciting to see research in this area moving forward.\n\n'But this particular research is at an early stage, and we don't yet know how this device would be practical, safe and effective for people with diabetes.'\n\nAnd Karen Addington, UK chief executive of the type 1 diabetes charity JDRF, said: 'Adults and children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day, simply to stay alive.\n\n'Being able to take this insulin orally, rather than via injections or a pump, could make life significantly easier. We await the next stages of this particular research with interest.'\n\nIt is hoped the new capsule will relieve the everyday burden on diabetes sufferers piercing their skin with a needle", "description": "A team from Massachusetts Institute of Technology has created a 30mm pill coated in a protective layer of polymer that is capable of surviving stomach acid.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19402354-0-image-a-44_1570461620365.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
