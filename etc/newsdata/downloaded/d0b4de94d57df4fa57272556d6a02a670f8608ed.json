In the first trailer for the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian, a cruel bounty hunter with a penchant for metal helmets (Pedro Pascal) is on the prowl and doing what he does best to make a living. In the second, Werner Herzog offers a little backstory to let us know that our Mandalorian isn\u2019t just driven by greed. \u201cIs the world more peaceful since the revolution?,\u201d he ponders. \u201cIt is a shame that your people suffered.\u201d Definitely helps contextualize all those severed Stormtrooper heads, but Disney+ is (wisely) playing things close to the vest until The Madalorian finally premieres on November 12.\n\nRelated", "description": "The Mandalorian trailer has premiered thanks to Disney\u2019s new streaming service, Disney+.
