The search and rescue operation continues as we reach out to next of kin to share details of sad incident and plan together next course of action,\u201d KWS tweeted on Monday.\n\nKWS had earlier put the number of the dead at four.\n\nNaivasha Sub-County Commissioner Mathioya Mbogo said the seven who were swept away were all Kenyans and six had visited the park from the western city of Kisumu.\n\n\u201cThose swept away were two minors, two women, two men and the local guide,\u201d he said.\n\nKWS had said earlier the victims included five Kenyan tourists, a local guide and a non-resident whose nationality was not disclosed. KWS said the gorge in park was closed to the public on Sunday after the incident.\n\nThe park is famous for its gorges, cliffs and steam plumes from geothermal activity underground, and in areas adjacent to it, the steam is harnessed to generate electricity.\n\nThe park has also been used as a location for films like Tomb Raider II:Cradle of Life, according to the Kenya Film Commission.\n\nGorges in the park are prone to flash floods and have in the past killed visitors. In 2012, floods killed seven who were part of a church group on a trek.", "description": "Flash floods killed six people at Kenya's Hell's Gate National Park and left one person missing after their tour group was swept away, the state-run wildlife authority said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
