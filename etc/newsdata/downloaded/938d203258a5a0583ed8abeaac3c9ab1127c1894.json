I\u2019m coming back.\n\nSo says Zlatan Ibrahimovic, in a decidedly cryptic social media post, which means he\u2019s planning a move back to La Liga, or a family holiday to the Costa del Sol. It\u2019s hard to see the 38-year-old re-signing for Barcelona but perhaps he would be tempted by a January move to second-placed Granada? Watch this space.\n\nGranit Xhaka \u2018devastated and sad\u2019 after Crystal Palace game, says Unai Emery Read more\n\nNewcastle could probably do with a bit of the Swede\u2019s razzle dazzle up top, but they may have to settle for the France U21 international Ibrahima Sissoko, who is no relation of the former Toon favourite Moussa. The word on the wire is that Newcastle have met Strasbourg\u2019s \u00a313m valuation and will begin talks over personal terms in the coming days, as Steve Bruce looks to reinforce a midfield currently being held together by the Longstaff brothers.\n\nManchester United have sent their finest to watch the Italian teenager Sandro Tonali, who has been dubbed the \u201cnew Pirlo\u201d on account of him playing for Andrea\u2019s first club, Brescia, and the fact that he nearly always stands on the near post at corners. Probably. The 19-year-old midfielder could cost United around \u00a340m.\n\nEverton have forgotten that their \u00a322.5m summer signing Jean-Philippe Gbamin is due to return from injury in January because they are already making plans to spend some more dosh on Spartak Moscow\u2019s Alex Kral. The midfielder \u2013 who played in the Czech Republic\u2019s victory over England this month \u2013 likes a tackle and would cost considerably more than the \u20ac12m Spartak paid a couple of months ago.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nRumours that Granit Xhaka has already set sail on the good ship, Do One, are premature \u2013 Arsenal\u2019s players have reportedly told the Swiss they want him to continue as the club\u2019s captain.\n\nHowever, the Gunners are thinking about about new blood, namely Xhaka\u2019s compatriot Denis Zakaria, who is currently tearing up trees for Xhaka\u2019s former club and the Bundesliga leaders, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. The thing is, Liverpool are also keen and PSG had a \u20ac30m bid rejected in the summer.", "description": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic to return to La Liga? | Newcastle to spend \u00a313m on Ibrahima Sissoko? | Arsenal to replace Granit Xhaka with Denis Zakaria?", "authors": ["Michael Butler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88c1b4f92ab4b6b9a8689e90a956a7bc2e4676c9/393_97_2792_1676/master/2792.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1a69811b64f91b6fcbaeec900e14de4c", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
