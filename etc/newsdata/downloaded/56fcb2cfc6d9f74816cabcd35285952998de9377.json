Do you all go home at night to some offshore island where the long-term damage you\u2019re doing to America doesn\u2019t matter?\u201d\n\nAnd what\u2019s even more frightening is that there are now so many incentives in place in media and politics \u2014 from gerrymandering to unlimited campaign contributions to data systems that can ever more perfectly define us, divide us and subdivide us \u2014 to ensure that these people will keep on hammering our system until they smash it to pieces.\n\nLook at Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who was questioned last Wednesday at a House hearing by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A.O.C. was trying to grasp why Zuckerberg thinks it\u2019s O.K. for politicians to run political ads that contain obvious lies, as the Trump campaign has already done in a Facebook ad about Biden viewed by some five million Facebook users.\n\nThis is all about money for Zuckerberg, but he disguises his motives in some half-baked theory about freedom of the press \u2014 so half-baked that he couldn\u2019t explain it even when he knew he would be asked about it by a congressional committee. Read it and weep:\n\nA.O.C.: \u201cCould I run ads targeting Republicans in primaries saying they voted for the Green New Deal?\u201d\n\nM.Z.: \u201cCan you repeat that?\u201d\n\nA.O.C.: \u201cWould I be able to run advertisements on Facebook targeting Republicans in primaries saying they voted for the Green New Deal? If you\u2019re not fact-checking political advertisements, I\u2019m trying to understand the bounds here of what\u2019s fair game.\u201d", "description": "Not in the Cold War, not during Vietnam, not during Watergate did I ever fear more for my country.", "authors": ["Thomas L.
