The blood tests showed Elisha was positive for amphetamines.\n\nThe Hessels said they have never been around meth and had no criminal history of drug use. They then learned it was the house that was the problem.\n\nHessel told KSDK they asked neighbors and got hints that the home was a meth lab. \"I went ahead and bought a test over the internet and tested it myself and it did come back with unsafe levels in the home,\" she said.\n\nJoseph Mazzuca, CEO of operations at the Meth Lab Clean Up Company, told Insider that it's not that unusual to end up in a house that was once used as a former meth lab, because many fly under the radar. He said nationally, police only bust about one in 10 labs in the US. In some states, only one in 20 or 30 is busted, he said.\n\nMeth lab decontamination and disclosure regulation varies by state and county\n\nElisha and Tyler Hessel. KDSK\n\nOn top of that, regulations vary in every state \u2014 the federal government has little to do with the cleanup of such sites, and it's up to local and state governments to regulate.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that only 23 states have state-wide regulations on drug-lab decontamination and disclosure laws on listing contaminated properties.\n\nRead more: A Chinese property heiress charged with murdering her ex at a California mansion says he was killed in botched kidnap plot\n\nIn Missouri, where the Hessels live, a seller is required to disclose that that methamphetamine production occurred on the property if the seller knew about it. No one told the Hessels, and it remains unclear why.\n\nOften if a house is rented out, owners may not know what tenants are doing inside the home, Mazzuca said.\n\nBuyers should research a home's history before purchasing it\n\nMazzuca told Insider that the best thing a person can do before moving into a house is do some research on local laws and figure out who regulates the reporting of meth labs.\n\n\"The best thing people can do is find out who the governing body would be based on those regulations, and call the health department or the local department and see if they have any records. Sometimes local police departments and local sheriff's have records,\" he said.\n\nBuyers can also check out the home's property deeds in the county clerk's office to see if police have registered the property.\n\nTalking to neighbors and researching the Drug Enforcement Administration's National Clandestine Laboratory Register Data can give buyers clues into the home's history.\n\nWhen inspecting the home, buyers should look for telltale signs of meth production, like old cans, packages of acetone, drone cleaner or other chemicals, as well as rubber gloves, tubing, dust masks, camp stoves, and coolers, CNN reported.\n\nPeople can also test the home themselves. Mazzuca recommended an at-home test from methlabtestkit.com.", "description": "Joseph Mazzuca, CEO of operations at the Meth Lab Clean Up Company, told Insider that nationally, police only bust about one in 10 labs in the US.", "authors": ["Kelly Mclaughlin"], "top_image": "https://static.businessinsider.com/image/5d8d19a421214c0b414f58a2-750.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
