Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\n(Reuters) - Los Angeles Clippers forward Paul George will miss the start of the NBA season while recovering from off-season surgery on both shoulders, he told ESPN on Sunday.\n\nGeorge said he will be out until \u201cNovember-ish\u201d, which would see him miss the training camp as well as the team\u2019s season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers on Oct. 22.\n\nGeorge, who was acquired in a trade by the Clippers during an off-season splash that also saw them sign free agent Kawhi Leonard, had surgery on his right shoulder in May and an operation on the left shoulder five weeks later.\n\n\u201cI had my labrum done on my left shoulder and the rotator cuff done on my right,\u201d George told NBA.com.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not 100% but if I had to put a percentage on it, I think I\u2019m about 85, 90ish,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNot all the way there, still got a little bit of stuff \u2014 range to work through, strength to work through \u2014 but I\u2019m close. I\u2019m happy with where I am at.\u201d The Clippers made the playoffs last season without a single star player, and will enter the new campaign as one of the NBA\u2019s favorites to win the league title.\n\nGeorge, 29, was an MVP finalist in the 2018-19 season when he posted career-best averages of 28 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.2 steals.", "description": "Los Angeles Clippers forward Paul George will miss the start of the NBA season while recovering from off-season surgery on both shoulders, he told ESPN on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435382326&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T05Z-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
