Dominick Pilla, a U.S. Army ranger killed in Somalia on October 3, 1993.\n\n\u201cTeachers are paid to educate our students, they\u2019re not paid to indoctrinate our students, he continued. \u201cWhat this woman is doing would be bad in any school, but because it\u2019s in the (Sgt.) Dominick Pilla School \u2013 who gave his life for our military \u2013 it\u2019s reprehensible.\u201d\n\nThe principal decided after the school board meeting to reassign the teacher to administrative duties during the morning\u2019s homeroom period to avoid further conflict, the Philly Voice reported.", "description": "A New Jersey middle school teacher has been reassigned outside the classroom because she kneeled during the Pledge of Allegiance.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/school-children-saying-pledge-of-allegiance-filephoto-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
