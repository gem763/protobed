Rhule is less than three season into his original seven-year deal. The announcement came less than 24 hours after the Bears improved to 4-0 with a 23-21 victory against Iowa State on Saturday.\n\nThe 44-year-old Rhule was hired away from Temple by Baylor in 2015. He walked into a volatile situation and faced a major rebuild after a scandal over the handling of sexual assault claims by the school led to the firing of Art Briles in 2015.\n\nWith a depleted roster, Baylor went 1-11 in 2016, Rhule\u2019s first season. The Bears jumped to 7-6 with a bowl victory last season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/APTop25CollegeFootballPoll and https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Baylor has extended football coach Matt Rhule's contract through the 2027 season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
