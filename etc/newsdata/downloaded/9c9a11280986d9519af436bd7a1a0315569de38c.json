It's good to have Damian joining us in our squad, even though it was sad to lose Jesse,\" Bok assistant coach Mzwandile Stick said on Monday.\n\nWillemse will play behind S'bu Nkosi and Warrick Gelant on the wings in a new-look back three, and Stick is keen to see what he can offer.\n\n\"I'm glad we could get an opportunity in the group stages to let all of these guys get some minutes behind them going into the playoffs,\" he said.\n\n\"We've seen what Damian has done before for this team where he played against England at Twickenham in front of around 85 000 people.\n\n\"A 21-year-old being able to perform at that level shows that he's got a proper head on his shoulders.\"\n\nWhile Willemse is being given a run on Tuesday, South Africa's first-choice fullback remains Willie le Roux.\n\nKick-off on Tuesday is at 12:15 (SA time).\n\n- Compiled by Lloyd Burnard", "description": "Damian Willemse has gone from not being in the Springbok World Cup squad to wearing the No 15 jersey for Tuesday's Pool B clash against Canada in Kobe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7899/4724c3f3a8de4db9a76d769523a8283e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
