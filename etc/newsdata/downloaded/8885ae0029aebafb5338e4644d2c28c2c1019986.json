So, in terms of defining these kids, we can say neurotypical, but to tell you the truth, ultimately, I see that the more we learn about a child, the more they appear in their true diversity as a unique individual. And if we see each child, each teen, each adult as a unique individual, then all bets are off as far as creating a dividing line between those who are neuro-diverse and those who are neurotypical.\u201d\n\nNature vs nurture\n\nThese may seem like academic disputes. Ultimately, many people with conditions like autism find that the term neurodiversity (and its contrast, neurotypical) is a useful and positive way of self-defining their identity and their community. There\u2019s certainly a need to reduce the stigma.\n\nAs Armstrong argues, we should try to question our assumptions about different behaviours and the value judgements we place on them. He points out that when he is delivering lectures, some people with autism will walk around the room. Clearly, that is not the way that most of the stationary audience are behaving. \u201cBut why is it \u2018abnormal\u2019 to want to move and learn at the same time?\u201d\n\nAfter all, these norms are often the result of social convention. \u201cWe're set up with a culture in such a way that we have expectations for behaviour, we have constants, we have guidelines, we have morals \u2013 and all for good reason,\u201d says Armstrong. \u201cSociety would fall apart without that. [But] I like to look back at the whole picture, and when I do that it makes the concept of normal very, very questionable, very muddy. And that's why I like to call people's attention to it, so that they don't automatically fall into unconscious or implicit biases.\u201d", "description": "Having been diagnosed with ADHD at 38, Howard Timberlake went on a personal quest to discover whether any of us has a \u201ctypical\u201d mind.", "authors": ["Howard Timberlake"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7m/d9/p07md96l.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
