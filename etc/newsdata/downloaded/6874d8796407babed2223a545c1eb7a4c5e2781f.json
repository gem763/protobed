At the last, though, Wyatt appeared in typically sinister fashion before leaving Rollins in his wake.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWyatt made clear he\u2019d intend to challenge the winner of the Strowman-Rollins bout, and left North Carolina having made a clear statement.\n\nEarlier in the night, Rollins and Strowman\u2019s tag title loss to Bobby Roode and Dolph Ziggler came after a typical miscommunication between the two unlikely partners, the challengers taking full advantage after Rollins fell victim to a Glorious DDT.\n\nThere was plenty of noteworthy action at Clash of Champions, but many matches seemed to struggle for pace and tempo \u2013 one of a few exceptions being the Raw Women\u2019s Championship match that saw Becky Lynch ultimately retain, despite being disqualified in her match with Sasha Banks after inadvertently hitting a referee.\n\nAJ Styles retained his United States Championship in a disappointingly-short match with Cedric Alexander, an equally-brief affair seeing Bayley keep hold of her Smackdown Women\u2019s Championship after beating Charlotte Flair. Bayley\u2019s new \u2018heel\u2019 persona will take a bit of getting used to for many fans, especially given this underhand victory \u2013 achieved by a blow from an exposed turnbuckle \u2013 came at the expense of one of the best \u2018bad guys\u2019 in the business.\n\nTitle changes were something of a rarity at Clash of Champions, but The Revival were one of those celebrating after they claimed the Smackdown tag team champions. After isolating Xavier Woods and having already eliminated Big E from the affair, Dash and Wilder were able to force Woods into submission, working over his already injured knee.\n\nAlexa Bliss and Nikki Cross were among the other incumbents to escape relatively unscathed, successfully turning back the challenge of Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville \u2013 not helped by a distraction from those clamouring for WWE\u2018s 24/7 Championship.\n\nTwo other titles staying put were the WWE Championship and the Intercontinental championship. Kofi Kingston continues his lengthy reign with the former after once again defeating Randy Orton in the latest in their series of matches, while Shinsuke Nakamura needed some help from Sami Zayn to ensure The MIz didn\u2019t snare away his Intercontinental gold.\n\nAnother notable moment for the night was the return to action of Luke Harper, who has been missing for months as a result of injury and reported backstage discontent. Harper has been rumoured to be heading to the exit door for some time now, but dispelled those fears \u2013 for now at least \u2013 by aiding his former partner, Rowan, defeat Roman Reigns in their no disqualification match.\n\nWWE CLASH OF CHAMPIONS \u2013 QUICK RESULTS\n\nUniversal Championship: Seth Rollins (c) defeated Braun Strowman\n\nRaw Women\u2019s Championship: Sasha Banks defeated Becky Lynch (c) by DQ.\n\nWWE Championship: Kofi Kingston (c) defeated Randy Orton\n\nRaw Tag Team Championship: Dolph Ziggler & Robert Roode defeated Seth Rollins & Braun Strowman (c)\n\nSmackDown Women\u2019s Championship: Bayley (c) defeated Charlotte Flair\n\nSmackDown Tag Team Championship: The Revival defeated The New Day (c)\n\nWomen\u2019s Tag Team Championship: Alexa Bliss & Nikki Cross (c) defeated Mandy Rose & Sonya Deville\n\nIntercontinental Championship: Shinsuke Nakamura (c) defeated The Miz\n\nNo Disqualification Match: Rowan defeated Roman Reigns\n\nKick-off Show results\n\nCruiserweight Championship Triple Threat: Drew Gulak (c) defeated Humberto Carrillo and Lince Dorado\n\nUnited States Championship: AJ Styles (c) defeated Cedric Alexander via Styles Clash", "description": "Seth Rollins retained his Universal Championship at a cost at Clash of Champions, after being attacked by \u2018The Fiend\u2019 Bray Wyatt.
