The bloc of agrarian PSL and anti-system Kukiz'15 was at 9.8per cent while the far-right Confederation would get 6.6 per cent.\n\nEarlier, exit polls released just seconds after voting stopped put the ruling Law and Justice party on 43.6 per cent of the vote, which would give the party 239 seats in the Polish lower house, slightly more than the 231 required for a majority.\n\n\u201cWe have a reason to be happy,\u201d Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the party's leader, told an overjoyed crowd of supporters just minutes after the exit polls became public.\n\nBartlomiej Pejo (R) and Grzegorz Braun (L) from the Confederation Coalition address supporters at an election night event Credit: Tomasz Gzell/EPA-EFE/REX/EPA-EFE/REX More\n\n\u201cDespite being opposed by a powerful force we won and everything indicates we will continue to win. And if it does continue, there will be good changes.\"\n\nCivic Coalition, the main opposition group, took 27.4 per cent of the vote according to the polls. There is also a chance that the Confederation, a far-right alliance that has faced accusations of anti-Semitism and racism, could make it past the five per-cent threshold needed to take seats in parliament.\n\nA victory for Law and Justice will lend the government the momentum to push ahead with a program that it says will make Poland a fairer country and which critics have warned amounts to a power grab.\n\nBefore the election Mr Kaczynski said he wanted to change the country's constitution \u201cto strengthen freedom,\u201d but this could embroil the government in further in conflicts both at home and abroad.\n\nThe EU has already threatened Poland with legal sanctions over a controversial overhaul of the judiciary that it said undermined the rule of law, so any continuation by Law and Justice in the same direction could deepen the rift between Warsaw and Brussels.\n\nAt the same time Law and Justice\u2019s victory could further stoke tensions and divisions within Polish society.\n\nDuring its first term in office the party made little effort to reach out to those who opposed it, preferring instead to often demonise them and in some cases cast doubt over their patriotism and loyalty.\n\nOpposition parties are were hoping that the final vote count would deny Law and Justice an outright majority, forcing them to attempt to form a coalition - a difficult task for a party that has alienated almost all of its rivals.\n\nGovernment supporters will argue that the outcome proves Law and Justice\u2019s mix of left-wing policies with socially conservative and nationalistic stances on other issues has been a hit with the voters.\n\nThe party says it has delivered on its promising to narrow the gap between the haves and the have-nots in Poland, introducing social welfare policies popular with its core voters, who tend to live outside Poland\u2019s increasingly prosperous cities.", "description": "Early results suggest Poland\u2019s conservative government has\u00a0retained its parliamentary majority, allowing it to forge ahead with a controversial programme of reforms that has put the country on a collision course with the EU.\u00a0 The ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party was in the lead in Sunday", "authors": ["Matthew Day"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DfxDmaH9KgVzdK_lSvZ2kQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/bac657570d9ff616b91829d3141b2378", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
