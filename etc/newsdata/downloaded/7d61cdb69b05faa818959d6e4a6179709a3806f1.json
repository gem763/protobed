Lots of my appointments with producers and other contacts fell through. In cases where it seemed like I would be given the green light to take pictures, the location of shootings would change without notice. Getting access to the new luxurious cinemas in the metropolis of Lagos was hellish. But slowly, I managed to make headway.\n\nLong before I started working on this assignment, I had thought about exploring the story of Nollywood. I first hit on the idea at the beginning of 2008 when a friend, who is a model and actress, suggested taking a trip to India to shoot a collaborative movie between Nigerian and Bollywood actors on location. Unfortunately, the trip never happened.\n\nRecently, however, I had the chance to rejuvenate my idea through Reuters' Wider Image desk, which commissions in-depth photo stories. I wanted to explore the reasons why Nigeria\u2019s Nollywood has been so successful in a continent where conflict and poverty are rife.\n\nMillions across Africa watch Nigerian films. They are as popular abroad as they are at home. I remember taking a shuttle bus while on holiday in Gabon a couple years ago and as I settled down in my seat, the screen started playing a movie. It was an export from Nigeria.\n\nNollywood has generated a great deal of money, not just for those directly involved in the movies, but also in other areas like advertising and corporate sponsorship. Thousands of movies are produced on shoestring budgets for different media formats, and they have fed emerging digital television channels for decades.\n\nAt an academic forum at the University of Lagos, a friend told me recently that Nigerian film has also played an important role in downplaying the political tensions in Nigeria. She argued that Nollywood movies soothed the nation, and had even helped prevent civil war.\n\nI cannot really agree \u2013 I think the movies are mostly just entertainment. But after seeing the works of Nigerian film producers like Kunle Afolayan and his older counterpart Tunde Kelani, whose ingenious filmmaking incorporates political and satirical themes, you can see the importance of Nollywood in political communication.\n\nNigerian entertainment has changed a great deal since the 1950s and 60s, when theatre groups would travel between communities and villages in trucks and set up their stages. Now the film industry is so powerful that UNESCO reported in 2009 that it had overtaken America\u2019s Hollywood in the number of films it produced, and its output was only surpassed by India\u2019s Bollywood.\n\nLast August I spent four days in the rainforest in Nigeria\u2019s southwest, watching in amazement as cameras, lights, shadows, smoke, and a group of talented people, from electricians to costumiers, worked together to create one example of the media that is so influential across Africa and its diaspora.\n\nThe film, titled \u201cOctober 1,\u201d was set during a key moment of Nigerian history, just before independence, and shot by Kunle Afolayan.\n\nShortly before that, in July, I went to Abeokuta, also in Nigeria\u2019s southwest, and spent another four days on-location to see the filming of \"Ake\". The movie was an adaptation of a childhood memoir by Nigerian Nobel Laureate for literature, Wole Soyinka, and produced by Dapo Adeniyi.\n\nMany people have dismissed Nollywood as cheap and sensationalist. Others have argued that Nollywood has provided a much-needed platform for Africans to tell African stories. Whichever side of the argument you stand on, the story of Nollywood is one power and bright lights. I intend to follow it wherever it leads.", "description": "Nigeria's movie business, popularly known as Nollywood, is one of the biggest in the world. According to UNESCO the industry produced around 1,000 movies in 2011 \u2013 more than the number that came out of the United States \u2013 although most were released only in video formats.", "authors": ["Akintunde Akinleye"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ9THfGO_td3L5LOTejuOIA9xbNyQxddp7Ssn8yHniuI2i1Cr4FPV42vDDI-RAidZ-rdBwfHaz2rmmWwv9f9ijkqkyIoGYfg3KSQO2ivrBCoM"}
