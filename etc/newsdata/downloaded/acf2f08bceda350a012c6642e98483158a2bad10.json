The decision to shut off support for its headset on its newest flagship phones casts doubt on the future of both the Gear VR and other headsets that use phones as their screen and processor, as standalone devices with built-in displays like the Oculus Quest are on the rise.\n\n\u201dWe remain committed to innovating in VR and AR to deliver incredible new experiences to our consumers,\u201d Samsung tells The Verge.\n\nSamsung didn\u2019t mention Gear VR once during its Unpacked event, and it hasn\u2019t updated the headset since 2017. The most recent phones to support it were all four of the Galaxy S10 phone models announced in February, but only via an adapter. (The same was true of last year\u2019s Galaxy Note 9.) The Gear VR still has a product page on Samsung\u2019s store, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be available for purchase there anymore. You can still purchase it on Amazon for $99.99.\n\nI just got confirmation from @Samsung. No version of the #Note10 is compatible with the GearVR. Not a huge loss tbh. Standalone is where it's at. #VR \u2014 Anshel Sag (@anshelsag) August 7, 2019\n\nDespite Samsung\u2019s decision, Gear VR may still have life ahead of it, as my colleague Adi Robertson has written. The device was bundled with previous Samsung phones, is still compatible with many older models of Samsung phones, and is used as a tool to showcase VR at events like film festivals. Until standalone headsets drop in price, Gear VR remains one of the lowest-cost ways to bring VR into classrooms and events beyond the DIY efforts like Google Cardboard. It\u2019s also still receiving app updates and new releases alongside newer models.\n\nBut with Gear VR not being compatible with Samsung\u2019s newest flagship phone, and with Google announcing in May that the Pixel 3A wouldn\u2019t support Android\u2019s built-in Daydream platform, it\u2019s hard not to think that phone-based VR may be on the decline.\n\nUpdate August 8th, 1:42PM ET: Samsung officially confirmed to us that the Note 10 is not compatible with Gear VR.", "description": "Samsung\u2019s just-announced Galaxy Note 10 is \"not compatible\" with Gear VR, the company\u2019s virtual reality headset that works only with a phone slotted in front of the lenses, Samsung confirms to The Verge following an earlier report by tech analyst Anshel Sag.
