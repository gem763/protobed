The Hong Kong police responded to the protester's behavior with water canons, tear gas and some violence.\n\nThe Hong Kong Police issued an interim injunction that was extended by court for the airport this weekend, warning anyone in breach of the order is liable to the offense of contempt of court.\n\nOn Sunday, the Hong Kong Police warned protesters to leave and \"stop their illegal acts immediately.\"\n\nIn response to the disruption caused by protesters, the Hong Kong public rail system, the MTR, suspended the airport express line. Multiple flights were reportedly canceled. This isn't the first time the city's public transportation system had to shut down due to increasing chaos from the mass demonstrations.", "description": "Thousands of demonstrators blocked roads and public transportation routes to the Hong Kong International Airport on Sunday, saying they hope to draw the world's attention to their movement.", "authors": ["Grace Shao"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106106341-1567269564514gettyimages-1164982199.jpeg?v=1567269590"}
