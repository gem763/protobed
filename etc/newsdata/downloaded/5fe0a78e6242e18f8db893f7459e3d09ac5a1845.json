Last week the company saw its share price fall sharply to nine-year lows after the company announced that it was cutting its revenue guidance on the back of concerns that the health problems now being expressed about vaping could result in a sharp slowdown in sales.\n\n\n\nIn August we heard early reports about a series of deaths from the 18-35 age group which may have been linked to vaping. These reports have now turned into a stream and ultimately nixed the recent attempts by Altria and Philip Morris to come back together after an 11-year separation.\n\n\n\nThe tobacco industry is now facing the prospect of an existential crisis, with a slowdown on normal cigarette sales already cutting into profits, e-cigarettes were supposed to be the next key growth area. This strategy now appears to be under threat after the US threatened to ban e-cigarettes from the market until the US Food and Drug Administration has done a more significant study. There is also the not insignificant threat that the sector could face which could send the sectors earning potential up in smoke. Given these problems looking for a new CEO would appear to be the least of its problems.\n\n\"DISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution-only provider.
