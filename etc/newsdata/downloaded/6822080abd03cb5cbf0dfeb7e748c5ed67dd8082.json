REUTERS/Simon Dawson/Files\n\nConfidence among businesses has ebbed to its lowest levels since the global financial crisis.\n\nThe labour market, which has long been a silver lining for the economy, is also starting to show signs of slowing, raising questions about the strength of consumer spending.\n\nThe different Brexit scenarios for the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy make it hard to gauge the outlook for the year ahead, not least for the Bank of England, and some investors fear Britain is already flirting with recession.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters last month put the probability of a recession within a year at 35%.\n\nBelow are some indicators of the British economy and how they have changed since the June 2016 Brexit vote.\n\nBUSINESSES STRUGGLE\n\nPessimism among businesses has reached the highest levels in years.\n\nThe gauges of future activity in the Lloyds Business Barometer, CBI Growth Indicator and IHS Markit/CIPS surveys have all turned weakened recently.\n\n(Graphic: UK business morale wilts under Brexit crisis, global slowdown here)\n\nThe closely watched IHS Markit/CIPS survey last week showed Britain\u2019s dominant services sector contracted unexpectedly in September \u2014 and marked the worst reading in a major developed economy.\n\n(Graphic: UK ranks bottom among developed world services PMIs here)\n\nHOUSEHOLDS STILL SPENDING\n\nHousehold spending has supported Britain\u2019s economy since the Brexit vote, although there are signs that households have spent more on non-discretionary goods such as food, while spending in restaurants and hotels has weakened.\n\nAs of the second quarter, spending on the latter was about 1.5% lower than in mid-2016, but nearly 7% higher for food and non-alcoholic drinks, according to official data.\n\nFigures from the British Retail Consortium and payment card company Barclaycard published on Monday showed shop chains had their worst September since records started in 1995, although spending on entertainment increased.\n\n(Graphic: Household spending on essentials rises at expense of eating out here)\n\nLABOUR MARKET\n\nThe labour market is the strong point of Britain\u2019s economy but some cracks have appeared recently. Employment fell in annualised terms in the six months to July 2019 to the greatest extent since early 2012.\n\nWage growth is at a decade-high although the BoE has said it may have peaked and there has been no pickup in productivity.\n\nA measure that BoE policymakers like to look at \u2014 the three-month annualised growth rate of private sector earnings, excluding bonuses \u2014 slowed in July from an almost five-year high of 5.9% in June.\n\n(Graphic: Are cracks appearing in Britain's labour market? here)\n\nINVESTMENT\n\nAlthough the Office for National Statistics has revised up the level of business investment in Britain\u2019s economy lately, the figures still show capital expenditure has stagnated since the Brexit vote.\n\n(Graphic: Business investment has stagnated since Brexit vote here)\n\nBusiness investment is running about 5 billion pounds lower than it would have been had it followed its pre-Brexit vote trend since the financial crisis, according to the latest data.", "description": "Britain's economy is increasingly showing signs of strain as the Brexit crisis and the global slowdown intensify, with the loss of momentum appearing to spread to areas which have hitherto been sources of growth.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438345087&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970CB", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
