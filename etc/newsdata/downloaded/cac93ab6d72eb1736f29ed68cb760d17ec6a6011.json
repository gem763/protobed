Thought by the family to be an icon, the painting hung on a wall next to the kitchen.\n\n\"I had a rare emotion with this little painting, almost indescribable,\" said Philom\u00e8ne Wolf of Act\u00e9on, who had made the discovery. \"In our profession, we know that this emotion was the result of a great master.\"\n\nNothing is known of the history of the painting's earlier ownership.\n\nAct\u00e9on consulted Eric Turquin, the Paris-based art expert on old masters, who collaborated on the sale of the painting. In June, Turquin was the co-seller of a painting attributed to Caravaggio that was sold privately for an undisclosed price to American collector J. Tomilson Hill.\n\nTurquin said his research identified the Compi\u00e8gne panel as \"the only small-scale work of devotion to have been recently added to the catalogue of authentic works by Cimabue.\" It was described as being in \"excellent general condition\".\n\n\"This was an easy sale,\" Turquin said, comparing the auction of the Cimabue to the cancelled public sale in June of the Judith and Holofernes attributed to Caravaggio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I was pleased at 10 million and tremendously happy at 15 million,\" he said of the Cimabue sale. \"The price was more than I could have dreamed, and there was a contemporary art gallery bidding, which was new for us.\"\n\nAccording to Turquin, The Mocking of Christ was part of the same late-13th-century altarpiece that once included Cimabue's similarly sized Flagellation of Christ, now in the Frick Collection in New York, and the Madonna and Child Enthroned Between Two Angels, now in the National Gallery in London.\n\nThe Frick acquired its Cimabue in 1950. The \"Madonna and Child\" was scheduled to be auctioned at Sotheby's in 2000 but was sold to the National Gallery by private treaty for about 7.2 million pounds ($10.8 million). Discovered in a house in Suffolk, in eastern England, it had been estimated to sell for 10 million pounds, according to Artnet.\n\nTraces of the original framing, the style and technique of the gold ornamentation, and the pattern of wormholes on the back of the Cimabue panel \"confirm that these panels made up the left side of the same diptych,\" Turquin said in a pre-auction statement.\n\nCimabue pioneered a more fluent and naturalistic style of figure painting in Italy. Only a dozen fully accepted works on panel are known to survive. All are unsigned. The most celebrated of these is the Crucifixion in Santa Croce, Florence, a painting badly damaged by flooding in 1966.\n\nThe Florence painter takes up the first biography in Giorgio Vasari's hugely influential Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects, published in 1550. Vasari describes how Cimabue emancipated himself from the \"stiff manner\" of Byzantine artists and was \"the first cause of the revival of painting\" before Giotto \"overshadowed his renown\".\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The 13th Century painting hung for years near a kitchen in France before being identified as a work by Cimabue, the artist who \"made modern art\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2207%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8d3ae9b0848d75959ae466cef59d75d0b8f36a57", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
