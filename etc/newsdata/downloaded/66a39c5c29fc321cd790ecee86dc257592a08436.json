The president has long promised to bring American troops home and reduce the country\u2019s military commitments abroad, but this month\u2019s decision, and the sudden way it was announced, drew condemnation from some of Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill, including Senator Lindsey Graham. \u201cPray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump administration,\u201d Graham tweeted soon after Trump first made the announcement (though the senator has since declared himself \u201cincreasingly optimistic\u201d). U.S. officials who had spent months trying to maintain an uneasy peace between Turkey and the Kurds, and who had emphasized the importance of the U.S. presence in Syria to keep the pressure on a down-but-not-out ISIS, were suddenly left explaining to furious lawmakers why the president seemed to have rejected the logic of their efforts.\n\nRead: The U.S. moves out, and Turkey moves in\n\nTrump stuck, rhetorically at least, to his guns. On Wednesday, he extolled a cease-fire that Vice President Mike Pence struck with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, one he said \u201ccould never have been made without this short-term outburst\u201d of fighting\u2014giving an ex post facto green light to an operation multiple officials had spent days insisting Trump never endorsed in the first place. But he did also hint at an evolution in his thinking: \u201cWe\u2019ve secured the oil, and, therefore, a small number of U.S. troops will remain in the area where they have the oil. And we\u2019re going to be protecting it, and we\u2019ll be deciding what we\u2019re going to do with it in the future.\u201d\n\nThere was also the small matter that the U.S. had actually sent an additional 14,000 troops to the region since May, generally in an effort, officials said, to deter the Iranian regime from attacking U.S. interests there. As part of this, Trump\u2014who campaigned on getting the United States out of the Middle East altogether and said the U.S. should never have been there to begin with\u2014oversaw the first deployment of American troops to Saudi Arabia since 2003.\n\nIt turned out that Syria would actually be no exception. Esper confirmed today that the U.S. would be leaving troops in the eastern oil-producing region of Deir ez-Zur, where the Islamic State once held territory and where the U.S. now has a base. The Defense Department had been undertaking a slow drawdown since Trump previously ordered all troops out (before reversing himself) in December. Esper said the U.S. was maintaining a \u201creduced\u201d presence\u2014and the decision to keep soldiers there was presented as an effort to deny ISIS renewed access to revenue-producing oil facilities.\n\nRead: Trump has achieved a \u201csloppy\u201d success in Syria\u2014for now\n\nAt a press conference with the Syrian Kurdish leader Ilham Ahmed this week, after Trump floated the idea of protecting Syrian oil fields but before he announced that some troops would stay, the Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal seemed offended by the very idea: \u201cTalk about the oil fields is a cruel distraction \u2026 The amount of revenue from the oil fields is basically a rounding error in the United States military budget.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces, for now, has vowed to continue its coordination with the United States, including guarding ISIS prisoners. By the end of the week, U.S. policy in Syria wasn\u2019t at all clear, but the message of the week\u2019s drama was. In Syria, the president wants to protect oil\u2014not people.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
