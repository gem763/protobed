You can make all kinds of arguments about whether he should've done that. It's not clear that if those troops had stayed there, they would've been in anything but danger.\"\n\nAfter the president ordered the removal of troops from the area, he received bipartisan backlash for leaving the American-aligned Kurds to fend off Turkish troops themselves.\n\n\"It was basically a fait accompli by the time he heard about it,\" Hume said. \"It does look so far like the kind of disastrous situation with atrocities and the rest of it that everyone had feared.\"\n\nHume added if American forces remained, there is no reason why Erdogan wouldn't have put them in harm's way.\n\n\"They could've been killed by Turkish forces,\" he said.\n\nMATT GAETZ KICKED OUT OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY HEARING\n\nHowever, he lamented the fact the Kurds had been staunch American allies in the fight against terrorists like ISIS.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn a statement posted to Twitter earlier on Monday, Trump specifically announced that steel tariffs would \"be increased back up to 50 percent,\" and the U.S. will \"immediately stop negotiations ... with respect to a $100 billion trade deal with Turkey.\"\n\nThe order would enable \"powerful\" additional sanctions against those who \"may be involved in serious human rights abuses, obstructing a ceasefire, preventing displaced persons from returning home, forcibly repatriation refugees, or threatening the peace, security, or stability in Syria,\" Trump wrote.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "Turkish President Recep Erdogan may have ordered an incursion into Syria whether or not President Trump kept a small contingent of American forces there, according to Brit Hume.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Hume-Trump-Erdogan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
