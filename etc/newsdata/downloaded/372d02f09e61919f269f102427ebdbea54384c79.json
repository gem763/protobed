Jay Inslee should reconsider seeking a third term as governor after dropping his presidential bid.\n\nWashington voters deserve the opportunity to choose from a variety of new political candidates who have patiently waited in the wings for his decision.\n\nIf Inslee relinquished the scepter, it would have a cascading effect on the political organization chart. The current state attorney general, lands commissioner and King County executive all would be gubernatorial candidates. That would spur healthy competition, new policy debates and a system refresh at multiple levels of government.\n\nFirst elected as state representative in 1988, Inslee served two terms in the state House and nearly eight terms in Congress. He\u2019s now in his second term as governor, and a third term would be a rare feat in this state.\n\nInslee deserves kudos for successfully using his presidential campaign to highlight the urgent need for federal action on climate change, and he\u2019s made headway in this state on the issue.\n\nSeveral presidential candidates praised this contribution to the dialogue, including Sen. Kamala Harris, who tweeted that \u201cfew leaders have done more to shine a light on the climate crisis\u201d than Inslee.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAt the same time, the Inslee campaign\u2019s failure to muster more than 1 percent support in polls suggests that message needs to be recalibrated to build broader support. This was foreshadowed by Inslee\u2019s failures to advance his most ambitious climate proposals in Washington state, including multiple attempts at a carbon tax.\n\nElevating the federal climate-change response must be a priority for the next president. To get there, candidates must propose solutions that are meaningful and reasonable beyond Seattle and the deep-green voter base.\n\nMeanwhile, Washingtonians would benefit from a slate of new leaders, bringing fresh perspective to ongoing state concerns.\n\nThat list includes persistent and unconscionable failings of the state\u2019s mental-health and prison systems. The next governor must play a bigger role in reducing homelessness, which is most visible in Seattle but is truly a state crisis. As McCleary school-funding reforms are fully implemented, the next governor must ensure that school outcomes improve for all students, and that means getting more kids through high school and truly ready for college or vocational training.\n\nBased on his comments last week, when Inslee vowed to continue crusading against President Donald Trump from Olympia, it\u2019s unclear whether Inslee is ready to step off the national stage and fully commit to clearing the backlog on the governor\u2019s desk. His pledge to serve all four years if elected sounds convincing today, but if called, would he leave for a cabinet position to help shape national environmental policy?\n\nDo you have something to say?

But now it\u2019s time to give others a turn.", "description": "Gov. Inslee succeeded in raising the profile of climate concerns in the presidential race.
