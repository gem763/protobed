Morning Consult determined the rankings by measuring the differences in net favorability \u2014 the share of U.S. adults with a favorable view of each brand minus those with an unfavorable view \u2014 among self-identified Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\u201cIt is fair to say that the media reacted to Trump\u2019s election with alarm \u2014 and changed the tenor of its coverage in a way that that made the Democrats think the media is more important and made Republicans think it was more biased,\u201d said Matt Grossman, an associate political science professor at the Michigan State University.\n\nThe difference between Republicans\u2019 and Democrats\u2019 net favorability for CNN, for example, stood at 66 percentage points last year. It grew 14 points to 80 this year, due to a 12-point drop in net favorability among Republicans, from minus 13 to minus 25. Republicans held more negative views than Democrats of every media outlet on the list except for Fox News.\n\n\u201cIn a way, it\u2019s really corroboration of the narrative in the industry right now,\u201d said Joe Barone, managing partner of Brand Safety Americas for GroupM, a media buying firm. \u201cThe narrative is that we\u2019re living in a polarized world, and media is both contributing to the polarization and reflective of the polarization.\u201d\n\nSteve Bannon, former White House chief strategist and Breitbart chairman, set the tone early in the Trump administration. \u201cThe media here is the opposition party,\u201d he told the New York Times in a story published six days after Trump\u2019s inauguration.", "description": "As President Donald Trump continues his relentless attacks on the mainstream media, the gap between how Republicans and Democrats view national media brands such as CNN and Fox News continues to widen, solidifying the country\u2019s partisan echo chambers as the next presidential cycle nears.", "authors": ["Joanna Piacenza"], "top_image": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/190930_polarizing-brands-2019_feature-image-still.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
