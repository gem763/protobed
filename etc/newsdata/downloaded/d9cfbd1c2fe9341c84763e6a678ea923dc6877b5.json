But at the events, attendees would be asked to pay for another three-day class that cost $1,997. And those who paid for those classes would be taught how to apply for new credit cards and increase the credit limits on existing cards. Then, according to the FTC, instructors would suggest using the credit to pay for additional training that cost more than $41,000.\n\nWhen customers complained, the FTC said Zurixx would offer refunds, but only if customers signed an agreement barring them from writing negative reviews or speaking to regulators.\n\nZurixx said in a statement that it welcomes the scrutiny and anticipates \u201ca positive outcome as we work directly and openly with the agencies involved.\u201d\n\nHGTV did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn 2016, The Associated Press spoke to about a dozen people who took classes by Zurixx, saying that they were pushed to buy pricey classes, but learned very little about the real estate business.\n\nIn addition to halting the business, Zurixx\u2019s assets were frozen, which could potentially be used to refund customers. The FTC typically asks courts to halt businesses in order to investigate them further.\n\n___\n\nFollow Joseph Pisani on Twitter: @josephpisani\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A court has agreed to put a temporary stop to pricey real estate seminars fronted by HGTV stars after the Federal Trade Commission said promises that the classes could make people rich were \"misleading\" and \"bogus.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joseph Pisani"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
