The current bill also has the queen on the front, but features historical economist Adam Smith on the back. Turner is the first artist to appear on a pound note.\n\nThe bank said security features that include two windows, a metallic hologram and two-color foil make the bill the \u201cmost secure Bank of England banknote yet.\u201d It\u2019s also the first bill showing the signature of the bank\u2019s chief cashier, presently Sarah John.\n\n\u201cThe new \u00a320 is an important part of our commitment to providing banknotes that people can use with confidence,\u201d John said. \u201cOur polymer notes are much harder to counterfeit and, with the \u00a320 being our most common note, this marks a big step forward in our fight against counterfeiting.\u201d\n\nRedesigns to the \u00a310 and \u00a35 notes also now produce them from polymer.\n\nThe \u00a320 is Britain\u2019s most used and most copied bill, accounting for nearly 90 percent of forgeries in the first half of 2019.\n\nThe Bank of England said it will gradually phase out the current \u00a320 bills, which were introduced in 2007.", "description": "Oct. 10 (UPI) \u2014 The Bank of England unveiled its new-look \u00a320 banknote Thursday, which it said includes security features to make it more difficult", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
