We need protection \u2026 against climate change, etc., not against migrants!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication that Europeans need to be protected from external cultures is grotesque,\u201d said Sophie in \u2018t Veld, a Dutch member of the European Parliament.\n\nOther leading European voices called Ms. von der Leyen\u2019s idea \u201can abomination,\u201d \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cscary.\u201d\n\nMs. von der Leyen defended her initiative in a statement arguing that \u201cthe \u2018European way of life\u2019 also means listening and debating with each other to find solutions for the common good. That is what I want us to do together.\u201d\n\nShe also said she was moved by a desire to reclaim terms of the political center such as \u201ctolerance\u201d and \u201cnondiscrimination\u201d that had been appropriated by fringe critics of the EU.\n\n\u201cWe cannot and must not let others take our language away from us,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is also part of who we are.\u201d\n\nShe left the door open to a name change. The European Parliament is not set to vote on her 27-member commission until Oct. 23.\n\nOutgoing European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas, a Greek politician who will fill the post, avoided the unfortunate word choice from his soon-to-be boss. In his social media profiles, he called himself the \u201ccommissioner-designate for migration, security, social rights, education, culture, and youth.\u201d\n\nThe controversial name was on the agenda for last month\u2019s meeting between Ms. von der Leyen and European Parliament President David Sassoli, who earlier called the choice for the renamed post \u201cbizarre.\u201d Ms. von der Leyen later told the German news service Deutsche Welle that the discussions were \u201cconstructive and positive,\u201d although no decision on a name change was announced.\n\nBoth Ms. von der Leyen and Mr. Schinas belong to the conservative bloc in the EU Parliament, the largest single grouping by a narrow margin.\n\nEurope watchers said the ruckus was a reflection of Brussels\u2019 attempts to deal with cultural, economic and political concerns of its restive central and Eastern European members. Many leaders in the region, notably Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, have fought what they call the EU\u2019s traditional \u201cglobalist\u201d approach and has pushed for more restrictive controls on immigration into the bloc.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for the commission president to ruffle a few feathers in the European Parliament once they start pushing their agenda,\u201d said Gian Franco Gallo, a former chief of staff for a French member of the European Parliament now working as a political affairs analyst with ABS Securities in Milan. \u201cBut von der Leyen may be the first to do it months before taking office.\u201d\n\nMr. Gallo also said Ms. von der Leyen may have less room for error than some of her predecessors because her margin of victory in the 751-member Parliament was just nine votes, far slimmer than any of her five predecessors when they sought approval from European legislators.\n\n\u201cIf she wants to get her agenda enacted once she\u2019s head of the commission, von der Leyen cannot afford to lose much support in the Parliament,\u201d Mr. Gallo said.\n\nPrickly topic\n\nMigration policy is an increasingly prickly topic in Europe. Violence, terrorism and poverty encourage thousands of people from Africa and the Middle East to set out for Europe every month. A fear of migrants was a major factor in Britain\u2019s 2016 vote to leave the EU. Immigration-skeptical governments won big electoral victories in Hungary and Italy last year, and protests centered on border security and migration policy have been held in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIf there is one central issue in Europe right now, it is migration,\u201d said Jose Ignacio Garcia, Brussels-based regional director for Jesuit Relief Service Europe, a migrant advocacy group. \u201cIt is a political factor in nearly every country.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Garcia brushed off the furor over the European \u201cway of life\u201d title as a \u201cbranding mistake\u201d by the incoming EU chief. He said the media and other observers should look past it.\n\n\u201cVon der Leyen acknowledged her mistake, and unless it becomes some kind of a trend, then maybe we can pardon her for picking the wrong words as she is getting started,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers say the problem runs deeper and that the EU is starting to embrace the restrictionist immigration and cultural policies in an attempt to co-opt nationalist parties.\n\n\u201cSome center-right politicians seem to think they can head off threats to their party from those further to the right on the political spectrum by adopting their challengers\u2019 rhetoric and ideas,\u201d Andrew Stroehlein, the European media director for Human Rights Watch, said in a Twitter post. \u201cThe results can be disastrous, of course.\n\n\u201cIf the framing of the new European Commission portfolio was a deliberate effort to try to mollify and copy the far right for political gain, it would be sad to see, but it wouldn\u2019t be the first time we\u2019ve seen it,\u201d he said. But it could also be the case that \u201cthe Commission simply didn\u2019t know they\u2019d chosen far-right framing for the portfolio name, because the shift in public rhetoric has moved so far to the authoritarian right, they just thought it was normal.\u201d\n\nAidan Regan, a professor in the School of Politics and International Relations at University College Dublin, said the debate sparked by Ms. von der Leyen\u2019s proposal calls into question a different problem \u2014 one that has bedeviled the EU from its founding days.\n\n\u201cWhat is a European?\u201d Mr. Regan asked. \u201cLook, I\u2019m Irish and my fiancee is from Spain, and even though we\u2019re both European I can promise you our two cultures don\u2019t have a lot in common.\n\n\u201c\u2018The \u2018European way of life?\u2019 If that means values like tolerance and democracy, then it makes some sense,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, Europe is just a collection of 28 countries, each with its own culture, practices and traditions. From that perspective, how do we know what the \u2018European way of life\u2019 is?\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
