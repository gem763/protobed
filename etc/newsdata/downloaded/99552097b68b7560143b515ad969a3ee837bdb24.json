Manufacturing firms also reported an increase in the backlog of orders and improved local business conditions.\n\nThe Richmond Fed composite index rose from \u22129 in September to 8 in October. Economists had expected it to hold steady at the negative reading, the bank said on Tuesday. The October result was so good it surpassed even the upper range of estimates of economists surveyed by Econoday.\n\nThe report hints at a possible rebound for the factory sector. Sluggishness in manufacturing this year has often been used as a cudgel against the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies, so the reacceleration of growth would be a major boon to proponents of taking a tough stance with China and raising tariffs.\n\nManufacturers were optimistic that conditions would continue to improve in the next six months, seeing both employment and wages continuing to expand.\n\nThere was little sign of inflation in the report. The growth rates of both prices paid by manufacturers and prices received declined. The prices paid increases continue to outpace the prices received, suggesting that manufacturing businesses are not passing along higher costs to consumers.\n\nManufacturers also said they expect the growth of future prices\u2013both paid and received\u2013to slow further in the near future. That might provide some reassurance to inflation hawks on the Federal Reserve\u2019s board that future rate cuts are unlikely to push inflation too high.\n\nManufacturers said they struggled to find workers with the necessary skills in October and expected this difficulty to persist in the coming months. This is a negative in the survey but it is good news for U.S. workers and the broader economy since a tight labor market can drive up wages and force companies to invest more in both training and technology to increase productivity.", "description": "Manufacturing looks much stronger than expected in Maryland,\u00a0North Carolina,\u00a0South Carolina,\u00a0Virginia, and West Virginia. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/wi/afp/17/d011a8_us-president-donald-trump-addresses-america-great-rally-in-greenville-e1571757444755-638x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
