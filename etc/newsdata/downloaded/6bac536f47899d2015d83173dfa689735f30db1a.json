The DOJ approved the T-Mobile-Sprint merger back in July after it was able to piece together a new wireless competitor by allocating some of Sprint\u2019s spectrum to Dish. The Federal Communications Commission formally voted to approve the merger late last week.\n\nDish is positioned to become the third largest wireless competitor after negotiations with the Justice Department to approve the merger.\n\nDish won\u2019t be building out a new headquarters, however. The company already houses its call center employees at the \u201cRiverfront\u201d facility in Littleton, Colorado and any new wireless HQ employees will work in that building (which looks eerily like a Cabela\u2019s location) as well.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s settlement with Colorado positions DISH, a company founded in Colorado, to make a transformative impact on the wireless market,\u201d Dish chairman Charlie Ergen said in a statement. \u201cThis will strengthen competition for millions of current and future customers across America while bringing to life the nation\u2019s first virtualized standalone 5G broadband network.\n\nColorado was formerly part of a multistate lawsuit spearheaded by the New York State Attorney General\u2019s office aimed at blocking the merger. Colorado is now the second state to drop out of the suit along with Mississippi. A trial date is set for December 9th.\n\n\u201cThe agreements we are announcing today address those concerns by guaranteeing jobs in Colorado, a statewide buildout of a fast 5G network that will especially benefit rural communities, and low-cost mobile plans,\u201d Chief Deputy Attorney General Natalie Hanlon Leh said in a statement to The Colorado Sun. \u201cOur announcement today ensures Coloradans will benefit from Dish\u2019s success as a nationwide wireless competitor.\u201d\n\nIn a press release, Dish said that it \u201cexpects to employ 2,000 full-time employees\u201d at the Colorado headquarters over the next three years.", "description": "Colorado is exiting a lawsuit challenging the deal after Dish Network has agreed to house its wireless headquarters in the state.
