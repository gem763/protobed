Pinch says the B.C. chapter of the club was launched in part by Terry Simmons, a graduate student at Simon Fraser University from California.\n\nAt the time, a large resort development was planned for the ski hill on Cypress Mountain and many people were concerned developers would clear cut trees in the area.\n\n\"Simmons came up the idea of getting Sierra Club involved,\" Pinch said. \"[It] seemed to make more sense to have this club that had a lot of knowledge about how to do a proper campaign.\"\n\nAlthough some area of the Cypress site was clear cut, the provincial government, facing pushback from activists, eventually designated the area as a provincial park in 1972.\n\nModern day movement\n\nPinch said another thing she tried to document in the book is the shift from local environmental movements in the past to how people grapple with more complex issues like climate change in the modern day.\n\n\"It is difficult,\" said Pinch. \"It's not something you can show pictures about, like, you know, trying to save the Vancouver Island marmot. It's not this very little creature that people, you know, that say oh let's get out there and do something about that.\"\n\nStill, Pinch says the passion and persistence of the group \u2014 which still boasts thousands of members and volunteers \u2014 can still make a difference.\n\n\"I'm hoping that the readers will go away with a feeling of hopefulness and optimism that it is possible to make change.\"\n\nListen to the interview with Diane Pinch on All Points West:", "description": "\"Passion and Persistence, Fifty Years of the Sierra Club in British Columbia\" shows how the non-profit advocacy group influenced B.C.'s environment movement.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3661610.1467398380!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bc-park-ranger-cypress-provincial-park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
