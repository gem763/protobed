The 10th-ranked team in the world will fancy themselves to finally reach the knockout stages, in a group that also features Samoa, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nEngland kick off their campaign against Tonga, who come into the tournament having mustered just two wins in seven World Cups. The two countries have previously only met once at a World Cup, when England defeated the Tongans 101-10 at Twickenham in 1999.\n\nThe most hotly-anticipated match of the group stage features two-time reigning world champions New Zealand opening their title defence against South Africa. The Springboks won the first two encounters between the two sides at the World Cup, including perhaps the most famous final ever, which saw Nelson Mandela present the Webb Ellis Cup to Francois Pienaar in 1995. The Kiwis have got the better of their rivals in the last two meetings.\n\nThe world's No1-ranked side Ireland begin their tournament against rivals Scotland. The two countries have only met once before at the World Cup in 1991, when the Scots defeated the Irish 24-15 at Murrayfield. Elsewhere, Wales start off against Georgia.", "description": "Check out the full match schedule and latest standings for Japan 2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/262136c6efd3859f2da7bb137b27ea54b65694e0/0_0_500_300/master/500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6caf59acd6187d1b999225d5f17575a5", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
