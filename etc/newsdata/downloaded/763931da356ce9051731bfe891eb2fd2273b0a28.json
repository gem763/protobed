Amid the placards carried by the tractors was one simple hashtag: \"No farmers no food.\"\n\nOne reporter said Malieveld was already full and the tractors kept coming. Hague mayor Pauline Krikke warned of an \"unsafe situation\".\n\nBut the main disruption was across the country as tractors snarled up motorways and main roads. A convoy on one motorway in the southern province of Brabant swerved from left to right to prevent traffic getting past.\n\nIt was not just the farmers who took to the streets but their children too, as they headed to a Christian primary school on toy tractors in the eastern farming town of Ommen.\n\nHow serious is the crisis?\n\nThe Dutch top court, the Council of State, ruled in May that Dutch rules for granting building and farming permits breached EU law on protecting nature from nitrogen emissions, prompting a halt in thousands of projects including new roads, housing blocks and airports.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nitrogen dioxide air pollution 5-10 January (sequence is played twice)\n\nLast week an advisory committee said drastic measures were needed, both in farming and on Dutch roads.\n\nLiberal MP Tjeerd de Groot called for livestock production to be halved, meaning six million fewer pigs and 50 million fewer chickens, prompting a furious reaction from farmers. He blamed intensive livestock farming for much of the Netherlands' nitrogen emissions problem and argued that the key to the future was modern, sustainable agriculture.\n\nFarming groups believe measurement of carbon dioxide and nitrogen is inaccurate and the debate has been hijacked by city-based climate change protesters.\n\n\"We feel as if we're being put in the dunces' corner by city types who come and tell us how things should be in the countryside,\" one of the protest organisers, Mark van den Oever, told the Trouw website, adding that farmers shouldn't be blamed for the whole nitrogen issue.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Tractor drivers and protesters continued to arrive throughout the morning ahead of the Hague protest\n\nLast month, broadcaster RTL Nieuws reported that the worst pollution problems facing the Dutch were around Amsterdam, nearby Schiphol airport and Rotterdam.\n\nThe government has been criticised by climate campaigners for pushing ahead with the return to Formula One motor racing at Zandvoort next year. The sports minister said he was hopeful that measures to tackle nitrogen emissions would not affect the race.\n\nThe Dutch government has set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions next year by 25% of 1990 levels. Last month a health watchdog said emissions had been cut by 15% cut in that time, largely by reducing methane, nitrous oxide and other gases. Carbon dioxide levels have remained the same.", "description": "There were some 1,100km (700 miles) of jams as farmers reacted to plans to cut nitrogen emissions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FF67/production/_109038356_056962884-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
