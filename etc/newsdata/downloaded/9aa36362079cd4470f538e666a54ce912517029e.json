The boyfriend named in court only as 'Bradley' was not present but is still thought to be in an ''on-off relationship' with Frost.\n\nAt Stockport magistrates' court, Frost who lives with her mother in Knutsford, was ordered to pay Miss Paton \u00a350 compensation after she admitted common assault.\n\nShe also admitted common assault on two police officers and was ordered to pay them a total of \u00a3100 damages.\n\nThe incident occurred on October 5 after Frost, who has a daughter aged 12 months, had been out drinking with friends from 6pm until 2am.\n\nProsecutor Miss Victoria Newman said: ''Safari knows the defendant as they have shared previous ex-partners. They came across one another in the early hours and made eye contact, Safari said 'did you have a problem?' and it's clear that she didn\u2019t have a problem with the defendant.\n\n\"But the defendant replied \u2018yes I do, Bradley cheated on me with you - he\u2019s been with me since I was 14 weeks pregnant\u2019.\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd)\n\n(Image: Safari-Leigh Paton/ Cavendish Pr)\n\n''At that point the complainant who was with her friends turned away and tried to walk out but her bag was pulled behind her. She turned around and the defendant began to punch her to the head.\n\n\"The complainant fell to the floor and the defendant was on top punching her to the face. Safari was screaming for help whilst the defendant continued to hit her to the face and pull her hair.\n\n''Both parties are separated and police attended and restrained the defendant at this point she starts to dig her large fingernails into them in an attempt to scratch them and she flailing her arms around. She continued to scream and shout and was repeatedly swearing and was rolled onto her side prevented any lashing out.\n\n''The officers then put her back on her front to avoid any further injury although she is still struggling. They repeatedly told her to stop scratching but she said 'get the f**k of me you gay little c**t'.\n\n\"At 4.25am these officers had to get assistance as were still struggling and she was still screaming. They lifted her into the van and then she began banging her head against the cage door inside.\n\n''Officers opened the door and deployed CS gas and said this would wear off and she needed to remain patient and calm and offered water and tissues.\n\n\"But as they attempted to take her to custody, officers had to stop the vehicle due to the defendant continually banging her head in the cell.\"\n\n(Image: Safari-Leigh Paton/ Cavendish Pr)\n\n(Image: Katie Frost/ Cavendish Press (Ma)\n\n''Whilst the police were called to the garage following reports of females fighting, it\u2019s clear the defendant had instigated it and then lashed out at the officers.''\n\nFrost was also sentenced to a community order for 12 months and was ordered to complete 120 hours unpaid work.\n\nShe was also ordered to pay \u00a390 in costs.\n\nIn mitigation, defence lawyer Vic Wozny said: ''A long relationship had started with this gentleman when she was 14 weeks pregnant to another person and it is the case he was treated as the father figure to the child.\n\n\"He was unfaithful on the day in question and she was in the store and then in all of the stores in the whole world, the complainant should come in with her four friends.\n\n''The complainant comes over to her and says 'what you looking at' and then threw the relationship in her face and called her child an 'inbred' and at that stage my client lost it.\n\n''She had just found out that that the young man was sleeping with the victim and just picture this girl who had just turned 18 with all her problems and how bad she would have felt by that.\n\n\"My client has expressed to me she apologised for being her and wishes not to be here again.'''", "description": "Katie Frost, 18, had been drowning her sorrows when she unexpectedly encountered love rival Safari-Leigh Paton at the end of an eight-hour drinking binge in Knutsford, Cheshire", "authors": ["Abigail O'Leary", "Image", "Katie Frost", "Cavendish Press", "Ma", "Safari-Leigh Paton", "Cavendish Pr", "Manchester", "Ltd"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703600.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Cavendish-Press-Manchester-Ltd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
