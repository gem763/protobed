Trump had initially been expected to stay away completely from the summit but White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said earlier Monday she wouldn't be surprised if Trump popped in.\n\nThe summit is taking place against the backdrop of global demonstrations to urge action on climate change.\n\nIn her speech, Merkel stressed the need for countries to work together and \u201cfollow the advice of science\u201d on climate change, saying there was \u201cno doubt\u201d that humans are responsible for causing it.\n\nTrump has a history of denying links between human activity and climate change, and has rolled back environmental regulations and agreements \u2014 positions that are popular among conservative lawmakers and a rallying point for his supporters, especially on the Christian right.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are active and demonstrate, and put pressure on us, but there are also doubters, and it is the duty of every government to bring everyone along. Germany is facing up to this task with our measures agreed last Friday,\u201d Merkel said, referring to a multi-billion euro climate plan \u2014 which has been criticized as too timid.\n\nThe U.S. president left after Merkel\u2019s speech, spending a total of 14 minutes at the summit before heading to a religious freedom event, according to a pool report.\n\nTrump and Merkel have had a tense relationship since he took office, with the U.S. president often criticizing Berlin's defense spending and migration policies, and the German leader subtly taking aim at Trump's policies, temperament and relationship with the truth.\n\nMonday's climate summit brings together leaders from dozens of countries to submit plans intended to surpass the emissions reduction and renewable energy goals of the 2016 Paris Agreement, an accord from which Trump withdrew and that many of the remaining signatories are well short of fulfilling.\n\nFor days, the U.S. administration indicated Trump would skip the summit to instead give an address on religious freedom. On Sunday, Trump told reporters that his absence from the event would not be \"a snub at all\" and noted that he was making visits to Ohio and Houston, where there is major flooding.\n\n\"The floods are very important to me, and climate change \u2014 everything is very important,\" Trump said.", "description": "US president had been expected to snub gathering.", "authors": ["Arren Kimbel-Sannit", "Emma Anderson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1169841399-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
