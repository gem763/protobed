Responding to the outcry over how it handles the data collected by its voice assistant, Apple has offered users a way to delete all of the recordings that Siri collects during use. The company has also stopped sharing audio recordings with human staffers in order to improve its service. Instead, it asks you to opt in to that feature via a pop-up that appears when you upgrade to this latest version of its mobile operating system.\n\nIf you were too quick to opt in when you upgraded and have decided you don\u2019t want to share your voice with Apple (or if you opted out and have decided that you don\u2019t mind if a few Apple employees listen to your voice), you can easily change your mind. Here\u2019s how:\n\nGo to your iPhone\u2019s Settings app, and tap on \u201cPrivacy\u201d\n\nTap on \u201cAnalytics & Improvements\u201d at the bottom of your Privacy screen\n\nLook for \u201cImprove Siri & Dictation\u201d and toggle it on (if you want to allow Apple to review your audio) or off (if you don\u2019t). There is a link under the toggle that you can tap on for more information.\n\nIn addition, you can now ask Apple to delete all of your audio information from Siri (which used to be a very convoluted and unsure process).\n\nGo to your iPhone\u2019s Settings app, and tap on \u201cSiri & Search\u201d\n\nTap on \u201cSiri & Dictation History\n\nTap on \u201cDelete Siri & Dictation History\u201d\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s it. You will get an acknowledgment that your data will be deleted.\n\nOne thing to be aware of: there is some interesting small print under that \u201cDelete Siri & Dictation History\u201d link. It says that any of your data that has been sampled by Apple \u201cto help improve Siri and Dictation is no longer associated with this iPhone and will not be deleted.\u201d Presumably, that includes any data that Apple collected before it allowed users to opt out of the process.", "description": "You can now delete your audio history with Siri.
