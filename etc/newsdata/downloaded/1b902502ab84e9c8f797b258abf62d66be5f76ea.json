(Tom McCorkle/for The Washington Post)\n\nI\u2019ve been on a western Mediterranean kick lately, especially enjoying some great bargains from Spain. This is the second week in a row a Spanish garnacha snags the greatest value of the week designation, another example where this category continues to shine. I was even more enamored of the tempranillo from Arrocal in Spain\u2019s Ribera del Duero region. These would be fun to taste side-by-side with the Domaine Neferis Selian Carignan from Tunisia, while crossing another wine country off your list. All three are bold, juicy reds, ideal to pair with smoky grilled meats. And while the coals are warming up, slake your thirst with a delightful ros\u00e9 from Spain or a crisp sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley.\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nLegado del Moncayo Monta\u00f1a Vendimia Seleccionada Garnacha 2017\n\nCampo de Borja, Spain, $14\n\nSpain\u2019s old garnacha vines produce some terrific value wines.

Domaine Neferis is one of a handful of family wineries exploring the export market. This carignan is rugged and spicy, featuring brambly flavors of dark berries and wild herbs. Decant this for at least an hour before dinner, then pair it with a hearty roast or stew. There is also a delicious Selian Reserve and a carignan-syrah blend from 2009, showing that these wines can age well.
