They\u2019re bad for privacy , public discourse, democracy and small business. They\u2019re spying on us, contributing to economic inequality and hooking us and our children on addictive, useless services. The companies, of course, object to these characterizations.\n\nWarren, who in March proposed breaking up big tech companies, began running a text ad on Facebook last Thursday to take aim at Zuckerberg.\n\n\u201cBreaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,\u201d the ad reads. It then goes on to say that while this isn\u2019t true, Zuckerberg has \u201cgiven Donald Trump free rein to lie\u201d on Facebook.\n\nWarren\u2019s ad is taking issue with Facebook\u2019s policy of not fact-checking politicians\u2019 speech or ads, the way it has outside parties fact-check news stories and other posts. Facebook has refused to remove a misleading video ad from President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign targeting Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nFacebook responded to Warren\u2019s move by tweeting Saturday that the Federal Communications Commission \u201cdoesn\u2019t want broadcast companies censoring candidates\u2019 speech. We agree it\u2019s better to let voters \u2014 not companies \u2014 decide.\u201d\n\nPolitical speech and tech companies\u2019 role in spreading or stifling it has been an ongoing issue for both sides. Sen. Kamala Harris, a California Democrat, urged Twitter TWTR, -1.44% to suspend Trump\u2019s account for violating the service\u2019s rules, while Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri is battling what he considers tech companies\u2019 bias against conservatives. Hawley has also told Zuckerberg that he should sell off WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nReaching out to conservatives, Zuckerberg has held a series of private talks and small, off-the-record dinners with journalists and commentators on the right to discuss free speech and other concerns. The dinners, starting in July, took place at one of Zuckerberg\u2019s homes in California, Politico reported Monday, citing unnamed people familiar with the meetings.\n\nSpokesmen for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who was said to have met with Zuckerberg as part of the series, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nZuckerberg confirmed the dinners, saying on his Facebook page that he\u2019s met with \u201cconservative politicians, media and thinkers.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be clear, I have dinners with lots of people across the spectrum on lots of different issues all the time,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote.\n\nThe big tech companies, in general, are trying to maintain a neutral stance, even if that draws the ire of politicians as divergent as the president and those trying to impeach him. In response to Warren, Facebook tweeted that voters rather than companies ought to be the ones weighing candidates\u2019 speech.\n\nSocial media services are \u201ccaught between a rock and a hard place,\u201d said Andrew Guess, a Princeton University political scientist who studies social media and its effects on political opinion.\n\nBlocking or suspending accounts for speech can prompt complaints of political bias or censorship, but a hands-off approach may be viewed as a free pass to politicians like Trump.\n\n\u201cAnything they do is going to attract criticism,\u201d Guess said. \u201cThat, of course, makes them a target.\u201d\n\nBeyond discourse and privacy, antitrust concerns have emerged as a major concern for lawmakers and candidates. This wasn\u2019t the case in 2016, when grumbling about the outsized power of tech was largely confined to activists and those on the most liberal end of the spectrum.\n\nStill, while there have been congressional hearings, investigations and fines, including a record $5 billion against Facebook, little has changed for Big Tech.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans may agree that Big Tech has problems, but they often differ on what those problems are \u2014 and how to fix them.\n\nA Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to pass legislation that seems too anti-business. That includes breaking up tech companies seen as too monopolistic. The same likely goes for any privacy law that restricts companies\u2019 ability to target ads to their liking. An ongoing impeachment probe makes any congressional action even less likely.\n\nStill, talking up Big Tech\u2019s problems has proven to be popular political rhetoric.\n\nWarren\u2019s call to break up tech companies has even garnered support from rivals such as Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who retweeted Warren for what he said was the first time. Cruz said \u201cshe\u2019s right \u2014 Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, another leading Democratic candidate, has also said breaking up Amazon, Google and Apple AAPL, -0.14% is \u201csomething we should definitely take a look at.\u201d\n\nTrump has been uneven in his criticisms. Amazon has been a frequent target, though that is due in part to CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019s ownership of The Washington Post. He\u2019s met with Zuckerberg privately, but he\u2019s also tweeted that \u201cFacebook was always anti-Trump\u201d and accused it of colluding with the news media against him.\n\nAmid all this, at least in public, the companies have mostly kept a low profile. But there are occasional glimpses of behind-the-scenes activity. Leaked audio from an internal Facebook meeting in July captured Zuckerberg acknowledging that if \u201csomeone like\u201d Warren is elected, he expects Facebook to fight back \u2014 and prevail \u2014 against efforts to break it up in court. But he added: \u201cAnd does that still suck for us? Yeah.\u201d\n\nAmazon, by contrast, briefly tried to debate the candidates on Twitter.\n\nIn April, after Warren complained that Amazon and other big tech companies have \u201ctoo much power,\u201d the company responded by pointing the finger at its main rival: \u201cWalmart is much larger; Amazon is less than 4% of U.S. retail.\u201d\n\nWhen Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a TV interview in June that Amazon pays workers \u201cstarvation wages,\u201d the company tweeted that she \u201cis just wrong.\u201d\n\nExpect the political pushback to continue, from both parties, said Joshua Tucker, co-director of New York University\u2019s Social Media and Political Participation Lab.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bipartisan issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the right and the left are criticizing it for different reasons.\u201d", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has escalated her tiff with Facebook by running an ad \u2014 on Facebook \u2014 taking aim at its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HF211_zucker_ZG_20190306213424.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
