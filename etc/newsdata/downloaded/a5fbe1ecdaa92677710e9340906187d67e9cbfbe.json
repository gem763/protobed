It became apparent quickly that apartment living wasn't all that conducive to raising two little boys. We wanted a yard, an extra bedroom and, of course, more space \u2014 but still in the city.\n\nWhen the time came to get pre-approved, I assumed we would have no problem affording a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home in the heart of Minneapolis. We had been pre-approved for $275,000, and according to Zillow, the median home value there is $265,000.\n\nThe problem wasn't that we couldn't afford these homes \u2014 it was that they were in such high demand. We'd make offers on $275,000 houses (our max price) and lose to bidders offering north of $300,000.\n\nMoving to the suburbs\n\nWe decided, for the sake of our finances and sanity, to expand our search to Roseville, New Brighton, and Arden Hills, three suburbs right outside Minneapolis and St. Paul. Not only were the property taxes lower in these areas, we could also get more for our money \u2014 more yard, more space, and potentially more bedrooms.\n\nWe ended up choosing a house in Arden Hills, a suburb about 10 miles northeast of downtown Minneapolis. Today, the median home value is around $350,000, but we purchased our home in 2017 for considerably less.\n\nThe house, which has three bedrooms and one bathroom, was listed for $250,000 (less than other homes in our neighborhood because of the one-bathroom situation) and we paid $265,000. That makes our monthly mortgage payment $1,760, which is around $400 less than our apartment rent (with twice as much space).\n\nLooking to buy your first home? Use this calculator to find out how much house you can afford:\n\nBecause we're in the suburbs, we do have more space outside for our kids to roam \u2014 our fenced-in yard is a quarter acre \u2014 but that also comes with some maintenance, which we honestly don't have tons of extra time for. We probably dish out $1,000/year for lawn and garden services, but we save money by paying a local college student to do the work.\n\nThe perks of an updated home\n\nHome ownership does come with costs that renting doesn't, especially if you buy an older home. Our house was built in 1946, and it's only had three owners since \u2014 the original owner, the family who bought it in 2012 and renovated it, and us.\n\nThanks to the previous owners' renovations \u2014 they totally flipped the house and replaced the roof and siding \u2014 we haven't had to deal with too much maintenance.\n\nSince we purchased the house, we've paid an HVAC person $300, and a chimney sweep $200 to clean our two chimneys. I anticipate we'll be dishing out another $200 soon, since it's getting colder.\n\nLiving with kids\n\nOn top of these occasional expenses, we also pay a bit more on utilities than some families because we have two little kids (lots of laundry, dishes, and baths) and I work from home (so the lights and heat or A/C are almost always running).\n\nWe pay around $160/month for our electricity, $20/month for our weekly garbage pickup, and $67/month for recycling and water, both of which are paid in a bundle to the City of Arden Hills.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nWhile there are some things we would have done differently for the sake of our finances (like putting down more on the house), we're really happy with our decision to move to the Minneapolis suburbs.\n\nThe house isn't perfect \u2014 the layout of the main floor is kind of weird, and we'd really like to add another bathroom once we can afford it \u2014 but those minor inconveniences are worth the stability of living in a home and neighborhood we generally enjoy.\n\nMy husband and I talk regularly about how glad we are we moved to Arden Hills: Sure, it's cheaper to live outside the city, but we don't totally feel like we've lost the convenience aspect. We have a great park and beach within walking distance, and downtown is just a quick jaunt away. We get the best of both worlds.\n\nFind out how much house you can afford:", "description": "When the couple was priced out of Minneapolis, they started looking at homes in the suburbs and found a three-bedroom place with a quarter-acre yard.", "authors": ["Ashley Abramson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9b7530880f26377560660b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
