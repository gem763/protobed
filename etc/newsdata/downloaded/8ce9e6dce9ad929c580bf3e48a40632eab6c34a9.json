Larry Hogan, \u2018furious\u2019 about Bay Bridge backups, orders Maryland to try to speed up repairs", "language": "en", "text": "Hogan cited huge backups on both sides of the bridge, in the Annapolis area of Anne Arundel County on the west and the Kent Island area of Queen Anne\u2019s County on the Eastern Shore. The worst backups have stretched to 14 miles heading east and up to nine miles heading west, while spillover traffic has swamped local roads.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe governor did not provide specifics of what the state would \u2014 or could \u2014 do, saying, \u201cThere is no real positive solution to make these problems and traffic backups disappear.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said he has asked the Maryland Department of Transportation to ensure the contractor is \u201cworking 24 hours per day\u201d and exploring ways to accelerate work, such as by using faster-drying concrete.\n\nHogan said he also has directed the Maryland Transportation Authority, which operates the bridge, to remove all toll booths, which slow traffic, and implement cashless tolling at all times as soon as possible. That would be a longer-term solution, state officials have said, because it takes time to remove the toll booths, install overhead gantries and make other necessary changes.\n\nAD\n\nThe problems were caused by the recent closure of the westbound span\u2019s right lane to replace the bridge deck. That has left two lanes to accommodate morning commuters, as well as Sunday evening traffic returning from beaches and large weekend events on the Eastern Shore.\n\nAD\n\nThe authority eased the worst eastbound backups by implementing all-cashless tolls from noon to 10 p.m. on Thursdays and Fridays, allowing motorists without an E-ZPass to pay by mail without the usual additional fee. The authority also resumed two-way traffic on the westbound span whenever necessary to clear particularly severe eastbound backups.\n\nHowever, the occasional two-way operations now leave westbound traffic with one lane, quickly backing up traffic onto Kent Island.\n\nAD\n\nApparently responding to complaints from officials in Anne Arundel and Queen Anne\u2019s counties that their suggestions were being ignored, Hogan said he also had directed state officials to \u201credouble their efforts\u201d to address local concerns and \u201caggressively welcome any constructive ideas.\u201d\n\nIn an emailed statement later Wednesday, the authority\u2019s executive director, Jim Ports, said the agency and contractor have been discussing how to do different kinds of work simultaneously \u201cto get multiple work zones up and running to ensure 24/7 progress and shorten the project duration.\u201d The authority also will \u201credouble\u201d work with local officials to reduce delays on both sides of the bay, Ports said.\n\nAD\n\nThe backups have resulted in some Queen Anne\u2019s school buses regularly running up to 20 minutes late. Eastern Shore businesses complain that they\u2019re losing customers, and Kent Island residents say they feel trapped at home on weekends. State agencies and some local businesses have begun offering flexible schedules for bridge commuters, while some Eastern Shore business leaders say they\u2019re worried the backups will scare off visitors.\n\nAD\n\nOne Kent Island resident recently tweeted that local roads were so jammed with westbound bridge traffic that families had to ride bicycles to a school event. Another motorist recently caught in an 8.5-mile eastbound backup tweeted, \u201cABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. Fix this CIRCUS.\u201d\n\nQueen Anne\u2019s County commissioner Stephen Wilson (R) said he was glad to hear the governor commit to accelerating the repairs. He also praised the state for ensuring that ambulances and other emergency vehicles kept a shoulder on westbound Route 50 to reach hospitals across the bridge.\n\nAD\n\nBut Wilson said he\u2019s not sure what more the state can do.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to work around the sheer physics of compressing three lanes of traffic into two,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nCommissioner James J. Moran (R), president of the Queen Anne\u2019s board, said that he hopes the state will require the contractor to add more workers and that the state also should post police at ramps on Route 50 to prevent bridge-bound traffic from trying to skirt the backups via local roads.\n\n\u201cThe project definitely needs to be done \u2014 it\u2019s a safety issue \u2014 but we just have problems pushing the westbound span to one lane and pushing traffic onto our side streets,\u201d Moran said.\n\nHogan rejected renewed calls by Comptroller Peter Franchot (D) to delay the $27 million project until the state finds better ways to reduce the backups. Because the repairs were deferred for more than a decade, the governor said, the \u201cseverely deteriorated\u201d bridge deck had created \u201ctremendous safety problems.\u201d\n\nFranchot said Wednesday that the state should suspend the repairs to plan more ways to reduce the traffic impacts rather than \u201cdoing it on the fly, after the fact, while people are sitting there.\u201d\n\nThe state is studying potential locations for building a third span at or near the Bay Bridge but has no funding to build it.\n\nAD", "description": "The Maryland governor says the contractor will work around the clock to expedite work on the westbound span.", "authors": ["Katherine Shaver", "Reporter Covering Urban Planning", "Transportation Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cZf2RfFhaYudcAT1VyEJbUbTTcc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXER6UHLWUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
