It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]\n\nWith so much uncertainty weighing on key economic metrics \u2014 most notably the U.S.-China trade war \u2014 the idea of buying dividend stocks is an attractive one. Primarily, as passive-income generating securities, dividend-bearers are likely to weather volatility better than stocks that don\u2019t offer payouts. Plus, any capital returns are bonuses on top of the yield.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHowever, dividend stocks typically have one glaring weakness, especially for those who depend on stocks for income: their payouts occur on a quarterly basis. That\u2019s not particularly helpful when our society revolves around monthly cost expenditures, such as mortgages, car payments, and utility bills. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why monthly dividend stocks are so attractive.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnder this arrangement, you\u2019re receiving income 12 times a year as opposed to the usual four times. Because money has a time component to it, monthly dividend stocks allow investors much more flexibility. Also, if you like to reinvest dividends into more shares of the target asset, a monthly schedule allows you to advantage technical dynamics, such as a pricing dip.\n\nThat said, conservative investors should adopt the same precautions toward monthly dividend stocks as you would any income-generating investment. For instance, you should never jump aboard a company or fund merely because they pay out monthly. The key here is healthy cash flows and robust, stable sectors.\n\nAt the same time, monthly dividend stocks offer speculators a reason to join in on the fun. With payouts every 30 days, sometimes risky, high-yielding names offer compelling opportunities. Of course, that depends on your personal tolerance to volatility.\n\nAnd with these cautionary notes out of the way, here are the eight best monthly dividend stocks to consider in 2019:\n\n\n\n\n\nLTC Properties (LTC)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhen it comes to boring sectors as I mentioned above, I can\u2019t think of anything more sleep-inducing than senior care. At the same time, I can\u2019t think of anything more robust and relevant than the senior care market. That\u2019s why investors ought to take a long look at LTC Properties (NYSE:LTC) and LTC stock.\n\nAs a viable name among monthly dividend stocks, LTC Properties utilizes a powerful tool as leverage: demographics. Baby Boomers are retiring in droves, which present serious challenges. But they also present opportunities. Increasingly, millennials are taking care of their aging family members, indirectly bolstering the case for LTC stock. That\u2019s because a senior may not have adequate funds, but a working millennial might.\n\nFurthermore, LTC stock has steadily trekked higher since the collapse of the 2000 tech bubble. Given the demographic tailwinds, I expect this longer-term trend to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Street Capital Corporation (MAIN)\n\nSource: Shutterstock", "description": "[Editor's note: \"8 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy for Consistent Income\" was previously published in July 2019.
