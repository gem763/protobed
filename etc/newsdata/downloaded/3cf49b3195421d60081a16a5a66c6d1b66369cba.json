REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nLast December, unexplained drone sightings disrupted flights at London\u2019s Gatwick airport, and the Heathrow Pause group aimed to pull off a similar stunt to put pressure on the government to take tougher steps to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nBut Heathrow said it remained \u201copen and fully operational despite attempts to disrupt the airport through the illegal use of drones in protest nearby\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe agree with the need for climate change action but illegal protest activity designed with the intention of disrupting thousands of people is not the answer,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\n\nThe Heathrow Pause group posted a live stream of its early-morning activities near the airport online, and said its drones had been kept on the ground with jamming signals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a little technical glitch. The drone isn\u2019t flying,\u201d an unidentified campaigner says in the video, as another holds a drone in the air.\n\nDetermined to avoid a repeat of December\u2019s embarrassment, police had already been moving people away from Heathrow\u2019s perimeter for 48 hours, issuing reminders that disrupting airport operations or flying a drone within a 5 km (3 miles) radius were serious crimes.\n\nOn Friday, they arrested two men at the airport on suspicion of conspiracy to commit a public nuisance, and said seven others had been arrested since Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe order has been implemented to prevent criminal activity which poses a significant safety and security risk to the airport,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nHeathrow Pause is a splinter group of the climate group Extinction Rebellion, which blocked streets in central London this year. It had said it would fly the drones no higher than head height and had no wish to endanger life.", "description": "Climate-change activists who hoped to bring London Heathrow, Europe's biggest airport, to a standstill on Friday instead found it was their drones that had been grounded.", "authors": ["Alistair Smout", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429370067&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0LS", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
