And the number of congenital syphilis-related newborn deaths ticked up from 77 to 94, a 22% increase.\n\nThe increase in congenital syphilis coincides with rising syphilis rates among reproductive-age women, Gail Bolan, the director of the CDC\u2019s STD prevention division, said in a letter announcing the findings. \u201cOne clear solution is to intensify our efforts to find women with syphilis and swiftly connect them to care and immediate treatment,\u201d she said. \u201cDoing so keeps them healthy and, for those who become pregnant, it keeps their babies healthy, too.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, gonorrhea cases rose 5% to 583,405 cases, another record high since 1991. Chlamydia cases rose 3% to an all-time reported high of more than 1.7 million. While syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia are curable with antibiotics, they can lead to serious health problems if left untreated, the CDC said.\n\nSeparate CDC analyses released earlier this year suggests gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men are at increased risk for STDs. The rise in STDs among women also suggests a concurrent rise in those diseases among heterosexual men, the CDC said.\n\nA 2013 CDC study estimated that \u201cthe lifetime cost of treating eight of the most common STIs contracted in just one year is $15.6 billion\u201d in 2010 dollars.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, any major medical plan sold after 2014 should cover at least 15 free preventative services and one wellness visit. Included in those are services like diet counseling, depression screening and immunization vaccines, so a consumer may exceed the limit before ever getting tested for STDs. The co-pay for such a test obviously varies depending on the insurance carrier, but some estimates put that cost at between $50 and $100.\n\nAt-home, mail-in STD tests can also provide an added layer of privacy and convenience \u2014 though some have raised issues regarding their accuracy, suggested they might be an inadequate substitute for an actual doctor visit, and questioned whether they lead to the right populations being tested for the right infections. They range in price from $45 to $350.\n\nSo what\u2019s behind the sustained escalation of STDs? The CDC points to a number of factors that can stifle access to prevention and care, including poverty, unstable housing and stigma; reduced condom use among high-risk groups like gay and bisexual men and young people, and budget cuts to state and local STD programs that have led to \u201cclinic closures, reduced screening, staff loss, and reduced patient follow-up and linkage to care services.\u201d\n\nThe Great Recession hit local governments hard, said Adriane Casalotti, the chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), which represents local health departments across the country. Since 2008, she told MarketWatch, the local health-department workforce has shrunk by nearly a quarter.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to STD prevention in particular, workforce ends up being even more critical, in a way, because [of] the labor intensity of getting people tested and treated and then finding out where the networks are of other people that might be at risk,\u201d Casalotti said.\n\nDisease-intervention specialists play a particular role on the ground, she added \u2014 working nontraditional hours, meeting with sometimes apprehensive patients, linking those patients with care if they test positive for STDs, and then bringing services to other populations that may have been exposed. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that if you don\u2019t have the staff,\u201d Casalotti said. \u201cAnd the staff were cut because they didn\u2019t have the budgets.\u201d\n\nThat said, cash- and personnel-strapped public-health departments have developed innovative ways to use what resources they do have to streamline the testing and treatment of STDs, Casalotti said. She pointed, for instance, to NACCHO\u2019s CDC-funded STD Express Initiative, which involves \u201ctriage-based\u201d testing and clinic visits without a full physical exam, self-collection of swabs by patients, and automation to speed up the process.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the STD surges reported by the CDC may counterintuitively signal that public-health professionals are doing a good job \u2014 that is, finding more cases of often asymptomatic STDs, Casalotti said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re actually doing better at testing and treatment,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we need to be doing better is on that prevention.\u201d\n\nEven as STD rates climb, studies indicate that American adults \u2014 especially young ones \u2014 are having less sex than they did in previous years. But Casalotti points to 2018 CDC data suggesting that while young people may have less sex or fewer sexual partners, the prevalence of condom use during sexual encounters among sexually active high-school students decreased between 2005 and 2017, putting people at greater risk of STD transmission.\n\nThis highlights the importance of comprehensive sex education that teaches young people how to protect themselves, Casalotti said, and does so in a way that doesn\u2019t stigmatize certain populations who don\u2019t typically see themselves in traditional sex-ed class settings, such men who have sex with men.\n\n\u201cWhen they do have sex \u2014 no matter what the frequency is \u2014 they need to be able to protect themselves,\u201d she said.", "description": "The local health-department workforce has shrunk by nearly a quarter since 2008, said one public-health expert.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS976_stds_ZG_20191009134152.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
