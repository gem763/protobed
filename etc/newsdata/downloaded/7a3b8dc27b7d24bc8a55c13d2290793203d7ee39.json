Hong Kong\u2019s government announced it has canceled a fireworks display that day, citing concern for public safety.\n\nIn Tuen Mun, protesters marched about 2 kilometers (1 1/2 miles) from a playground to a government office building. Many were dressed in black and carried umbrellas, a symbol of their movement.\n\nProtesters chanted, \u201cReclaim Hong Kong!\u201d and \u201cRevolution of our times!\u201d\n\nMost were peaceful but some took down a Chinese flag from a pole outside a government office and set fire to it.\n\nA government statement said some protesters \u201cthrew petrol bombs\u201d but gave no details of possible injuries or damage. It told people in the area to stay indoors and keep their windows closed.\n\nThe statement said protesters caused unspecified damage to the Tuen Mun light rail station and threw objects onto the tracks.\n\nOrganizers announced the event, due to last two hours, was ending after one hour due to the chaotic scene at the station.\n\nAn organizer quoted by government broadcaster RTHK, Michael Mo, complained police escalated tension by sending armed anti-riot officers.\n\nThat will \u201conly escalate tension between protesters and police,\u201d Mo was quoted as saying.\n\nElsewhere, scuffles were reported as government supporters heeded a call by a pro-Beijing member of the Hong Kong legislature to tear down protest posters at subway stations.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has agreed to withdraw the extradition bill. But protesters are pressing other demands, including an independent investigation of complaints about police violence during earlier demonstrations.\n\nProtesters complain Beijing and Lam\u2019s government are eroding the \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d and Western-style civil liberties promised to the former British colony when it was returned to China in 1997.\n\nThe protests have begun to weigh on Hong Kong\u2019s economy, which already was slowing due to cooling global consumer demand. The Hong Kong airport said passenger traffic fell in August, and business is off at hotels and retailers.\n\nPolice refused permission for Saturday\u2019s march but an appeal tribunal overturned that decision. The panel on Friday gave permission for a two-hour event that it said had to end at 5 p.m.\n\nProtesters in Tuen Mun also complained about a group of women from mainland China who sing in a local park. Residents say they are too loud and accuse some of asking for money or engaging in prostitution.\n\nThose complaints prompted a similar march in July.\n\nAlso Saturday, there were brief scuffles as government supporters tore down protest posters at several subway stops, according to RTHK.\n\nThe campaign to tear down protest materials was initiated by a pro-Beijing member of Hong Kong\u2019s legislature, Junius Ho.\n\nNear the subway station in the Tsuen Wan neighborhood, a woman who was tearing down posters threw a bag at a reporter and a man shoved a cameraman, RTHK reported. It said there was pushing and shoving between the two sides at stations in Yuen Long and Lok Fu.\n\nHo made an appearance in the Shau Kei Wan neighborhood but residents shouted at him and told him to leave, RTHK said.\n\nHo initially called for protest signs to be torn down in all 18 of Hong Kong\u2019s districts but he said Friday that would be reduced to clearing up trash from streets due to \u201csafety concerns.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the Hong Kong Jockey Club canceled a horse race Wednesday after some protesters suggested targeting the club because a horse owned by Ho was due to run.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hong Kong airport announced restrictions on access Sunday following what it said were calls to disrupt traffic there.\n\nThe airport train from downtown will skip Kowloon and other stops en route, the Airport Authority said. Only passengers with valid tickets and travel documents will be allowed into the airport.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Protesters in Hong Kong burned a Chinese flag and police fired pepper spray Saturday in renewed clashes over anti-government grievances.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Raf Wober"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/hong_kong_protests_89588_c0-181-2947-1899_s1770x1032.jpg?c6490e63dbd90aa0442563de90829a92f9e8d9e5", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
