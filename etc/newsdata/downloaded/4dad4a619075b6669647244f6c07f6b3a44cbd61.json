They will still need to be solved before any future trading arrangement is done,\u201d she said.", "description": "European parliament vice-president says EU will not succumb to threats from Boris Johnson", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/553a0e5fcc5fe49f73b433a3c248236089913fa7/0_2362_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2150fbf6a3016bf404ad52ea2c403b13"}
