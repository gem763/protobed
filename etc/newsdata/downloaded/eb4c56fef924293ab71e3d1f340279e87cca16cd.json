(AP) - A year ago, Oklahoma defensive coordinator Mike Stoops brought a shaky defense into the rivalry game with Texas.\n\nHe was fired the day after a 48-45 loss to the Longhorns.\n\nThis year, things appear to have changed under new defensive coordinator Alex Grinch. The Sooners are allowing just 19 points per game and have held their past four opponents to 20 or fewer points, and a swagger has developed with the success.\n\nTexas coach Tom Herman knows he will see something much different on Saturday when No. 6 Oklahoma and No 11 Texas meet in Dallas.\n\n\u201cI think you just see them playing so hard and flying to the football,\u201d Herman said. \u201cReally aggressive. Not terribly complex. Some of the things they do with their line movements and twists and stunts are going to be difficult for our offensive line and quarterback. (Sooner defenders) are in the right place at the right time, and they\u2019re getting there with their hair on fire and really physical.\u201d\n\nOklahoma linebacker Kenneth Murray remembers last year\u2019s loss. Though the Sooners got revenge in the Big 12 Championship Game, the regular-season game still sticks in his mind. He looks forward to the opportunity Saturday\u2019s game presents.\n\n\u201cDefinitely a game that that we want to go out here and we want to dominate,\u201d Murray said. \u201cDefinitely a game that we\u2019re going to go out here and we want to play the way that we play. And I think this team this year is different from the team last year. I think it\u2019s a different approach. I think it\u2019s a different mindset, and so I\u2019m excited to get some preparation this week and go out there and dominate on Saturday.\u201d\n\nMurray leads the way with 37 tackles. The preseason Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year also has four tackles for loss. Riley said Murray has bought in and adjusted to Grinch\u2019s system.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a good mentality and work hard and do everything right, the results are going to show eventually,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHe\u2019s starting to play at a pretty high level for us.\u201d\n\nThe Sooners rank fifth nationally in third-down defense, something Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley thinks could be a factor on Saturday at the Cotton Bowl. Texas ranks second nationally in third-down offense.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big factor, I think, on all sides,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt always is. Not anything new. It\u2019ll certainly be a little bit of strength versus strength there. As far as kind of how the teams have played up to this point, it\u2019ll be a fairly impactful stat when we look at it after the game.\u201d\n\nDefensive tackle Jalen Redmond leads the way with five tackles for loss. Defensive end Ronnie Perkins has four tackles for loss. Nose guard Neville Gallimore has been disruptive and has helped free his teammates up to make plays. Strong safety Delarrin Turner-Yell leads the secondary with 25 tackles. Cornerback Parnell Motley leads the team with five pass breakups.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be burning the midnight oil trying to figure out a way to score some points,\u201d Herman said. \u201cI\u2019ve been impressed with Coach Grinch in his short time there and the level they are playing at right now.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Jim Vertuno contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A year ago, Oklahoma defensive coordinator Mike Stoops brought a shaky defense into the rivalry game with Texas.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Cliff Brunt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/oklahoma_kansas_football_18729_c0-154-3694-2307_s1770x1032.jpg?02845156ea86890ae9278396f08cc9fe8fb7f97a", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
