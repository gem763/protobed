The hard is what makes us appreciate this.\"\n\nDespite her unique and keen eye for design, Joanna Gaines said her passion didn't come easy.\n\n\"What I realized is I had to step out. I had to be curious. I had to become a learner. I had to learn that and with that came the passion,\" she explained.\n\nThe parents of five are still working to strike a balance, now with even more on their plate as they prepare to launch their new cable network with partner Discovery Inc., and they admitted that working so close isn't always easy.\n\n\"We definitely disagree. It's not perfect. But for Jo and I, it really is a special bond we're extremely proud of,\" Chip Gaines said. \"We work really well together.\"\n\nHe also shared the \"secret ingredient\" that keeps their marriage so strong.\n\n\"Solid mutual respect,\" he said. \"A lot of hard work goes into this, but if you can get to a mutual place of respect, you can change the world.\"", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/joanna-gaines-01-hgtv-jc-190806_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
