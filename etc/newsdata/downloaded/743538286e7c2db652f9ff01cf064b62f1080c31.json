He thought that white Americans were scared of the country\u2019s growing Latino population, so he joined the League of United Latin American Citizens. He now registers voters weekly, including with the League of Women Voters, to atone for his \u201cwhite privilege,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI try to have my bases covered,\u201d said Mr. Olsen, 50, who wore a N.A.A.C.P. T-shirt to a campaign rally for Senator Kamala Harris here last week. \u201cIt just hurts my heart that white people are afraid of the country\u2019s growing Hispanic population. And I just can\u2019t allow that to continue.\u201d\n\nWhite liberals \u2014 voters like Mr. Olsen \u2014 are thinking more explicitly about race than they did even a decade ago, according to new research and polling. In one survey, an overwhelming majority said that racial discrimination affects the lives of black people. They embrace terms like \u201cstructural racism\u201d and \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d", "description": "The changing racial attitudes of white liberals are changing how 2020 candidates try to win votes.", "authors": ["Astead W.
