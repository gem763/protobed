(AP) - About 200 residents have been evicted from a northwest Georgia motel after public health officials shut it down as unsanitary.\n\nThe Daily Tribune News of Cartersville reports residents remained this week even after getting 24 hours\u2019 notice to vacate the Budgetel Inn.\n\nSchool officials say more than 50 children were left homeless, but says temporary housing has been secured for them.\n\nThe Georgia Department of Public Health suspended the motel\u2019s authority to operate, citing unapproved cooking equipment, insect infestations and lack of maintenance.\n\nOwner Sri Bollepalli says the shutdown surprised him, saying he has already spent $500,000 on improvements.\n\nBartow-Cartersville Drug Task Force Major Mark Mayton says police were called to the motel nearly 200 times last year. He says Bollepalli has had more than a year to fix problems.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Daily Tribune News, http://www.daily-tribune.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "About 200 residents have been evicted from a northwest Georgia motel after public health officials shut it down as unsanitary.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
