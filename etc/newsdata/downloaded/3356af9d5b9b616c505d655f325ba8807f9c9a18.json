The eye and the corner of his mouth was drooping. It was really noticeable.\"\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nVictoria bundled Kyle into their car and headed straight for hospital.\n\nThe Lego fanatic was unhappy about being wrenched out of class and with all the fuss he was getting.\n\nVictoria said: \"He kept saying 'I\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t need to go to hospital. I want to go home.'\n\n\"He wasn't in any pain.\"\n\nDoctors at the Lister Hospital near Stevenage disagreed with Kyle's diagnosis and made him stay in overnight.\n\nThe next morning he was put through an MRI scanner and by the afternoon the results were in.\n\n\"I got called into the room and got given the news that he had a tumour,\" Victoria explained.\n\n\"I was quite blunt. I knew it was going to be a stroke, brain tumour or blood on the brain.\n\n\"I said 'tell me now which one is it' and the doctor did.\"\n\nKyle and Victoria were raced to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge where doctors carried out further tests.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWhat they discovered turned a traumatic day into a devastating one for the Morrison family.\n\nKyle had a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) tumor.\n\nWhile brain tumor sufferers in the UK do not have a great prognosis - with only 15% living five years after diagnosis - significantly less than one in 100 DIPG sufferers survive for five years.\n\nMost children die within one to four months.\n\n\"It\u2019s a brain tumour of the nervous system,\" explained Victoria.\n\n\"The tumor is on his brain stem. No body has ever survived it.\"\n\nAfter the initial heart wrenching shock Victoria, who is also mum to two-year-old Tyler, began desperately looking for help.\n\nShe called hospitals all over the world hoping somebody would offer a second opinion that might save her child's life.\n\nNobody did.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nNow the family are tying to come to terms with Kyle's vastly shortened life expectancy, which doctors believe could be about a year.\n\nHaving done her own research, Victoria thinks it is more likely to be as little as three months.\n\n\"I\u2019m just trying to block it out,\" the mum said.\n\n\"He looks completely normal. I\u2019m trying not to get upset about it all, but I\u2019m quite angry.\"\n\n\"I want to start up my own charity. I want to scream from the rooftops about this disease and that it could happen to your child.\"\n\nAs the terminal diagnosis hangs over the Morrisons, Victoria has snapped into practical gear.\n\nFirst of all she is preparing Kyle for a gruelling bout of treatment.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nOn September 23 this meant taking the young boy into hospital to be fitted with a radiotherapy mask, a process she watched from behind a screen.\n\n\"All I saw was a red light going up and down his body and him screaming with the mask on,\" Victoria said.\n\n\"I thought to myself 'why the hell am I putting you through this?'\n\n\"What, so I can get a few extra months with you. Is that selfish? I don't know?\n\n\"The outcome either way is 0% survival. Do I put my baby through this for a few extra months?\n\n\"Will they suddenly find a cure? All I know is he's my bloody world and it scares me that within a year's time I won't hear his voice or even build Lego with him.\n\n\"My world is literally falling apart.\"\n\nOn October 7 Kyle will start a course of radiotherapy.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nWhen that is done he will head back to school for two days a week.\n\nThe rest of the time his mum will make sure he can do whatever he wants.\n\nTo help Kyle enjoy what time he has left as much as possible a Just Giving page has been set up on his behalf.\n\nSo far more than 350 people have donated more than \u00a39,000, making Kyle's dream of visiting Father Christmas in Lapland a reality.\n\nTo donate click here.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE Kyle Morrison from Cheshunt in Hertfordshire has a tumor with a 0% survival rate", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20429102.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Kyle-Morrison.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
