The three twisters, all rated EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale with winds around 130 mph, brought significant damage to sections of the city of 175,000.\n\nThe drone footage in the video above offers an aerial glimpse of the damages to trees and homes.\n\nA severe thunderstorm watch had been in effect since 6:25 p.m. that evening. While a tornado or two was listed as being possible, the focus was primarily on the potential for damaging winds.\n\nA \u201cbow echo\u201d entered Sioux Falls around 11:18 p.m., the storm\u2019s leading edge arching forward where it\u2019s pushed outwards by strong, descending winds. Several bursts of wind punctuated the line in various locations, which took on the form of a quasi-linear convective system, or \u201cQLCS.\u201d Once in a while, QLCSs can spin up tornadoes.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forecast the development of sporadic QLCS tornadoes, but issuing warnings for them is a completely different ball game. They usually form in the time it takes the radar beam to sweep around once, appearing suddenly and dissipating just as quickly as they came.\n\nHere is a closer look at a few of the pictures from our damage surveys today. pic.twitter.com/2S49yeABR6 \u2014 NWS Sioux Falls (@NWSSiouxFalls) September 11, 2019\n\nTuesday night was a case in point. The radar scan at 11:24 p.m. shows a broad area of inbound winds in blue, marking strong southerly winds flowing towards the radar. One or two pinkish-red pixels dot the map just west of the more intense blues. That marks a subtle, but important, change in wind direction over a very short distance, indicative of some rotation. A warning was not issued until the next radar scan.\n\n\n\nA developing circulation Tuesday night near Sioux Falls, SD. This scan was from 11:24 p.m. (NOAA/GR2 Analyst/Matthew Cappucci)\n\nShould a warning have been issued based on the 11:24 p.m. scan? Hindsight is 20-20. With a lack of widespread outbound (red) velocities to contrast with the inbound (blue), issuing a tornado warning \u2014 and waking thousands of people up in the middle of the night \u2014 would have been an extremely gutsy and risky call.\n\nNow let\u2019s fast forward to the next scan 1 minute and 26 seconds later. Can you spot the difference? That\u2019s a full-fledged tornado. The warning came 95 seconds later at 11:27 p.m. By then, the tornado had lifted, another one had developed, before it too had lifted. Both were on the ground for under a minute and a half, traveling less than one mile.\n\n\n\nCirculation rapidly intensifies by the time of the 11:25 p.m. scan. (NOAA/GR2 Analyst/Matthew Cappucci)\n\nA third funnel touched down at 11:28 p.m. near 41st Street in Sioux Falls.\n\nAll three twisters were dissolved by 11:30 p.m. The entire barrage to Sioux Falls lasted five and a half minutes \u2014 less time than it would take to sing Billy Joel\u2019s 1973 classic \u201cPiano Man.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also had significant straight-line wind damage\u201d said Todd Heitkamp, meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service in Sioux Falls.\n\n\n\nA possible debris signature associated with tornadoes in Sioux Falls area Tuesday night. (NOAA/GR2 Analyst/Matthew Cappucci)\n\nQLCS environments are dreaded by forecasters, and notoriously tough to predict. They put meteorologists in the \u201cdarned if they do, darned if they don\u2019t\u201d situation. QLCS tornadoes often spin up from signatures that in one radar scan may be very weak. But most of those weak signatures do not produce tornadoes. Warning on every single one would produce exorbitant false alarm rates.\n\nFortunately, Sioux Falls\u2019 weather in the coming days will be far more tranquil. Temperatures will hang in the 70s Thursday and Friday before a warmup arrives in time for the weekend.", "description": "They were all rated EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale and left behind significant damage to homes, structures, and tree.", "authors": ["Matthew Cappucci", "Meteorologist", "Capital Weather Gang", "September At Pm", "Matthew Cappucci Is A Meteorologist For Capital Weather Gang.
