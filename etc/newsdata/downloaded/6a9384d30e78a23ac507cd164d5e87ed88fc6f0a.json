That\u2019s the way he is. I chased after him down the tunnel,\u2019 Allen wrote in his autobiography Up Front, published by the Evening Standard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u201cCome on Arsene!\u201d I shouted. \u201cAre you a man or a mouse? Shake my hand.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u2018At that point, I lost it. The tunnel area was teeming with stewards, press and the players, who were beginning to make their way off the pitch. I couldn\u2019t believe his attitude.\n\n\u2018\u201cWhere are you walking to? You\u2019re a mouse!\u201d I screamed at him. I was ready to blow. \u201cJust because we\u2019ve won for once!\u201d\n\n\u2018I called him a few choice names. He kept looking at me, edging away. I was ready to punch him.\n\n\u2018Just as I went to swing for him, reserve goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini saved the day. He threw his arm over my shoulder. \u201cClive, what was the score?\u201d he said, smiling. He dragged me away and into our dressing room.\u2019\n\nWenger ignored Allen\u2019s bid for a shake (Picture: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAllen signed for Arsenal before he moved to Spurs, but never played a league game for the Gunners despite arriving from QPR for \u00a31.25m in 1980.\n\nThe forward did not fit into the formation being used by Arsenal at the time and was moved on to Crystal Palace before turning out in the league, with Kenny Samson going the other way and going on to become a Gunners legend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Arsenal issue Alexandre Lacazette injury update ahead of Sheffield United clash\n\nMORE: Mesut Ozil insists he\u2019ll see out Arsenal contract despite struggles under Unai Emery", "description": "Former Tottenham coach Clive Allen has admitted that he came close to punching former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, before Carlo Cudicini intervened.
