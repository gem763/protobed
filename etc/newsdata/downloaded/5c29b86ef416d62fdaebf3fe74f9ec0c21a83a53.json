An American ally needed money, and its new leader needed a meeting with the American president to bolster his position back home. It was made clear that the money and the meeting were contingent on the launching of a probe politically advantageous to Mr. Trump and disadvantageous to a possible 2020 rival.\n\nEveryone gets it, most everyone believes it happened, no one approves of it\u2014but it probably isn\u2019t enough. People have absorbed it and know how they feel: It was Mr. Trump being gross. No news there.\n\nTruly decisive testimony and information would have to be broader and deeper, bigger. Rudy Giuliani\u2019s dealings with Ukraine?
