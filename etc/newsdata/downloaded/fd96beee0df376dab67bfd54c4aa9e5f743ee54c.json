In total, the Twins have 12 division championships since 1965.\n\nIn 2016, the Twins finished with a 59-103 record. It was the franchise\u2019s lowest win total since the 1995 season. They followed that with an AL wild card game appearance in 2017 -- where they lost to the New York Yankees -- but fell 19 games short of the one-game playoff last year.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAs has been the case all season long, Wednesday\u2019s victory was highlighted by the long ball. Luis Arraez and Eddie Rosario both went deep in the seven innings to secure a win for Randy Dobnak.

Led by a 39-year-old Nelson Cruz, the Twins\u2019 \u201cBomba Squad\u201d consists of an MLB record five players eclipse 30 home runs this season. Cruz was the first to 40, hitting his 400th career homer in the process.\n\nMax Kepler (36), Miguel Sano (33), Eddie Rosario (32) and Mitch Garver (31) make up the rest of Minnesota\u2019s 30-home run club.\n\nStory continues\n\nTheir individual totals represent career highs, but Garver, a ninth-round draft pick in 2013, is probably the biggest surprise on this list. In 125 games before 2019, he\u2019d only gone deep seven times. But this season, Garver reached 30 homers in 68 fewer at-bats than he had previously taken in his entire career. Unfortunately, Garver was removed from Sunday\u2019s game against the Royals with right hip tightness, which the team claims was precautionary.\n\nCruz\u2019s .630 slugging percentage is the highest for a single-season in Twins history. Garver\u2019s 2019 mark of .623 is actually second on that list.\n\nThere\u2019s more to the Twins\u2019 offense than their prolific power. Though they aren\u2019t the leaders in any one category, the Twins are on pace with the Yankees and Houston Astros \u2014 one of which will be their competition in the ALDS \u2014 atop most of the league\u2019s offensive rankings.\n\nJorge Polanco has a team-best 186 hits while producing the Twins\u2019 first 40-double season since Trevor Plouffe in 2014. (His 106 runs are the most since Brian Dozier in 2017 / His 107, 108 runs are the most since Chuck Knoblauch in 1995 / His 109 runs are the most since Kirby Puckett in 1988.)\n\nLuis Arraez opened the season with Double-A Pensacola, but is batting .344 in 90 games since. In addition to Cruz, free-agent additions Jonathan Schoop and Marwin Gonzalez have been key pieces to a Minnesota lineup that\u2019s been without Byron Buxton (shoulder) since early August.\n\nAlthough the offense tends to steal the show, Minnesota\u2019s pitching has held up its end. The team ranks among the top-10 in overall ERA, with their starter and reliever ERA nearly identical.\n\nJose Berrios has struggled mightily since August, but he\u2019s got ace potential and entered that difficult stretch with a 2.80 ERA. Jake Odorizzi, who was acquired for a shortstop prospect in February, is the club\u2019s only starter with more strikeouts than innings pitched.\n\nTheir rotation will continue to be down a man after Michael Pineda was handed a 60-game suspension after testing positive for a banned diuretic on Sept. 7.\n\nTaylor Rogers settled in as the team\u2019s closer, while Trevor May and Tyler Duffey have been reliable workhorses in the Minnesota bullpen. The addition of Sergio Romo at the trade deadline and top prospect Brusdar Graterol in September give the Twins plenty to choose from for the postseason.\n\nWhat do they need to win the World Series?\n\nThe Bomba Squad cannot stop doing what it\u2019s done all year.\n\nThey\u2019ll either have to outslug the Yankees at their own game, overcome the three-headed monster at the front of the Astros\u2019 rotation or both. Regardless of the opponent, it\u2019s more likely that the Twins\u2019 offense would have to bail out their pitching rather than the other way around.\n\nOn top of that, Minnesota\u2019s rookie pitchers need to step up in big moments. Graterol, Randy Dobnak, Ryne Harper, Devin Smetzer, Zack Littell and Cody Stashak have all been effective since their debuts. Whoever makes the postseason roster out of that group will likely see some important innings in October.\n\nLingering questions\n\nWhat version of Berrios \u2014 and the rest of the rotation \u2014 will show up for the Twins in October?\n\nKyle Gibson has sputtered in his past eight appearances, even getting relegated to the bullpen earlier this month. Martin Perez allowed 21 runs in his past 20.2 innings entering the week.\n\nDobnak and Smetzer have made the most of their recent starter opportunities, but how well can two rookies with less than 100 innings between them be trusted in the playoffs?\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Minnesota Twins have clinched the American league Central division title for the first time since 2010.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vAElxGXArCwWJp3A37Xh_w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7YiZ6sFVELc6SMYE_XDqYA--~B/aD0yNzQ2O3c9NDExOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/c1b4b2b0-df0b-11e9-9fff-5a9ef1610bac", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
