However, Dash has retorted with a claim that its Latin American journey is not over yet.\n\nIn a somewhat strongly worded blog post Dash Latam founder George Donnelly wrote,\n\n\u201cDash\u2019s head office has informed us that Dash Latam operations are definitely not going to continue. That means that there will be no more promotions, events, buybacks, support and so on in the eight countries and 20 cities where Dash Latam was active, including Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala, Brazil, Spain and Trinidad and Tobago.\"\n\nDonnelly added that Dash\u2019s HQ was \u201cabandoning Dash Latam\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nHe remarked that Dash\u2019s central office \u201cleft its Latin American teams, in a very poor condition about six weeks ago and we could not continue.\u201d\n\nDonnelly added, \u201cWe were forced to make drastic cuts, and had to fire 80 people,\u201d before eventually halting operations.\n\nHe wrote,\n\n\u201cDash headquarters has decided that marketing is useless for now, and that the work [Dash Latam] has done and that the relationships we have forged have no value.\u201d\n\nDash has confirmed the closure in a letter, but says it will \u201ccontinue its operations as normal in the Latin America region,\u201d and was quick to remark that its \u201c30 Latin American teams supported by its network of Dash masternodes\u201d remain operational.\n\nThe company pointed out that its Dash Help Support Center remains open for anyone in the affected countries seeking clarification.\n\nComunicado oficial sobre la CONTINUACI\u00d3N NORMAL de las operaciones del equipo de Dash Help, y de los muchos otros p\u2026 https://t.co/NyTWiJcCNN \u2014 Dash Help - Support Center (@dashhelpme)\n\nDash says concerned users have been in touch, stating that they have received emails about the closure of Dash Latam. Indeed, it appears that Donnelly\u2019s and Dash\u2019s messages have left many in the area confused, with questions posted on Twitter and other platforms.\n\nAs recently as last month, Donnelly was enthusing about the progress Dash and Dash Latam was making in the eight countries in which it was active, in an interview posted on Dash\u2019s official website on September 21.\n\nAt pixel time (06:25 UTC), DASH trades at c. USD 73 and is down by 1% in the past 24 hours, trimming its weekly gains to less than 10%. The price is up by 8.6% in the past month and is down by almost 52% in the past 12 months.", "description": "The founder of Colombia-based Dash affiliate Dash Latam says that Dash has decided to pull the plug on it \u2013 ending the affiliate\u2019s activities in the Latin American and Caribbean regions, as well as Spain.
