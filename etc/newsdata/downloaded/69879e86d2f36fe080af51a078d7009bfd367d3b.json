They are so powerful and so wealthy that they are able to ignore questions about how they are enabling propaganda.\n\nBy selling politicians the chance to twist the truth and deceive voters, Facebook profits at the expense of the public good.\n\nWarren put it bluntly: Facebook is guilty of taking \"money to promote lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cA handful of monopolists\u201d should not \u201cdominate our economy and our democracy,\u201d she said.\n\nZuckerberg could largely solve this problem by simply refusing to accept political advertising. It is not a significant source of income for his company, which is worth upwards of $500 billion.\n\nAnother solution is for Facebook to set its own rules to stop political lies and propaganda. That is what newspapers and cable television companies do.\n\nIn both cases, Zuckerberg refuses to act.\n\nHe did nothing even after the documented abuse of Facebook was proven to be the number one pathway for foreign interference in the 2016 election.\n\nZuckerberg claims he is protecting America\u2019s free speech rights by allowing political spin, distortion and mockery to flourish on Facebook. People can decide if a politician is telling the truth for themselves, he says.\n\nHe says he is open to having the government put rules in place. That position allows him to use political paralysis in Washington as a smokescreen.\n\nWarren has a quick, simple solution: break up these reckless firms.\n\nAs you can imagine, Zuckerberg opposes Warren\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah,\u201d Zuckerberg told his staff in audio leaked to the website The Verge. \u201cBut look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Zuckerberg has no interest in Warren becoming president.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump and his campaign are betting big on the power of social media platforms like Facebook to carry the president to reelection. That explains the elevation of Brad Parscale Bradley (Brad) James ParscaleMORE, whose primary experience is as a digital media guru rather than in political organizing, to be campaign manager.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThomas B. Edsall, writing in The New York Times, noted that Trump\u2019s campaign has spent more than all three leading Democrats on social media.\n\nAccording to CNN, in the last week of September more than 1,800 ads ran on Trump's Facebook page mentioning \"impeachment.\u201d Those ads wildly distorted reality to make Congress and Democrats into villains attacking a blameless president.\n\nCNN reported: \u201cThe ads have been viewed between 16 and 18 million times on Facebook and the campaign has spent between $600,000 and $2,000,000 on the effort.\u201d\n\nJust as the rightwing smear merchants put bogus stories about Uranium One into the 2016 election to damage Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonClinton trolls Trump with mock letter from JFK to Khrushchev Trump-Graham relationship tested by week of public sparring Sunday shows \u2014 Mulvaney seeks to tamp down firestorm over quid pro quo comments, Doral decision MORE, they are doing the same in 2020 with anti-Biden smears regarding Hunter Biden\u2019s position with a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nIf Facebook continues to allow their platform to be abused by propagandists, they will be giving Trump a giant advantage in the 2020 campaign.\n\nThere is one obvious word for Facebook\u2019s refusal to stop the lies and in-kind contributions to Trump from Zuckerberg:\n\nSad.\n\nJuan Williams is an author, and a political analyst for Fox News Channel.", "description": "OPINION: The social media giant refuses to take even basic measures to crack down on disinformation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/zuckerbergmark_041018gn31_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
