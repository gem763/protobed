Temperatures are rising. The consequences for oceans, forests, weather patterns, biodiversity, food production, water, jobs and, ultimately, lives, are already dire \u2013 and set to get much worse.\n\nThe science is undeniable. But in many places, people don\u2019t need a chart or graph to understand the climate crisis. They can simply look out the window.\n\nClimate chaos is playing out in real time from California to the Caribbean, and from Africa to the Arctic and beyond. Those who contributed least to the problem are suffering the most.\n\nI have seen it with my own eyes from cyclone-battered Mozambique to the hurricane-devastated Bahamas to the rising seas of the South Pacific.\n\nI called on the climate action summit to serve as a springboard to set us on the right path ahead of crucial 2020 deadlines established by the Paris agreement on climate change. And many leaders \u2013 from many countries and sectors \u2013 stepped up.\n\nA broad coalition \u2013 not just governments and youth, but businesses, cities, investors and civil society \u2013 came together to move in the direction our world so desperately needs to avert climate catastrophe.\n\nMore than 70 countries committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, even if major emitters have not yet done so. More than 100 cities did the same, including several of the world\u2019s largest.\n\nAt least 70 countries announced their intention to boost their national plans under the Paris agreement by 2020.\n\nSmall Island States together committed to achieve carbon neutrality and to move to 100% renewable energy by 2030.\n\nCountries from Pakistan to Guatemala, Colombia to Nigeria, New Zealand to Barbados vowed to plant more than 11bn trees.\n\nMore than 100 leaders in the private sector committed to accelerating their move into the green economy.\n\nA group of the world\u2019s largest asset-owners \u2013 responsible for directing more than $2tn \u2013 pledged to move to carbon-neutral investment portfolios by 2050.\n\nThis is in addition to a recent call by asset managers representing nearly half the world\u2019s invested capital \u2013 some $34tn \u2013 for global leaders to put a meaningful price on carbon and phase out fossil fuel subsidies and thermal coal power worldwide.\n\nThe International Development Finance Club pledged to mobilize $1tn in clean energy funding by 2025 in 20 least developed countries.\n\nOne-third of the global banking sector signed up to align their businesses with the Paris agreement objectives and sustainable development goals.\n\nThe summit also showcased ways in which cities and global industries like shipping can achieve major reductions in emissions. Initiatives to protect forests and safeguard water supplies were also highlighted.\n\nThese steps are all important \u2013 but they are not sufficient.\n\nFrom the beginning, the summit was designed to jolt the world and accelerate action on a wider scale. It also served as a global stage for hard truths and to shine a light on those who are leading and those who are not. Deniers or major emitters have nowhere to hide.\n\nI will continue to encourage them to do much more at home and drive green economic solutions around the world.\n\nOur planet needs action on a truly planetary scale. That cannot be achieved overnight, and it cannot happen without the full engagement of those contributing most to the crisis.\n\nIf our world is to avoid the climate cliff, far more is needed to heed the call of science and cut greenhouse emissions by 45% by 2030; reach carbon neutrality by 2050; and limit temperature rise to 1.5C by the end of the century. That\u2019s how we can secure the future of our world.\n\nToo many countries still seem to be addicted to coal \u2013 even though cheaper, greener options are available already. We need much more progress on carbon pricing, ensuring no new coal plants by 2020, and ending trillions of dollars in giveaways of hard-earned taxpayers\u2019 money to a dying fossil fuel industry to boost hurricanes, spread tropical diseases and heighten conflict.\n\nGuardian joins major global news collaboration Covering Climate Now Read more\n\nAt the same time, developed countries must fulfill their commitment to provide $100bn a year from public and private sources by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation in developing countries.\n\nAnd I will make sure that the commitments that countries, the private sector and local authorities have made are accounted for \u2013 starting in December at the UN climate conference in Santiago, Chile. The UN is united in support of realizing these initiatives.\n\nClimate change is the defining issue of our time.\n\nScience tells us that on our current path, we face at least 3C of global heating by the end of the century. I will not be there, but my granddaughters will.\n\nI refuse to be an accomplice in the destruction of their one and only home.\n\nYoung people, the UN \u2013 and a growing number of leaders from business, finance, government, and civil society \u2013 in short, many of us \u2013 are mobilizing and acting.\n\nBut we need many others to take climate action if we are to succeed.\n\nWe have a long way to go. But the movement has begun.", "description": "Young people, the UN and a growing number of leaders are mobilizing, but we need many others to take action, the UN secretary general writes", "authors": ["Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e1f8a38cf87e9aec97334cb0b223f0c35240821/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7eeccf72031f9d13c39ac864e324ea28"}
