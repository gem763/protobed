And we\u2019re here for it.\n\nIn a recent blog post announcing the launch, Huda Kattan explained the inspiration behind the palettes: \u2018When we created our New Nude palette, we wanted to recreate what nude is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018During this process, we realized how different the perfect nude eyeshadow is for every skin tone; a \u2018nude\u2019 lipstick for a fairer skin tone wouldn\u2019t look nude on me, and the same goes for eyeshadow and other makeup products.\u2019\n\n\u2018It shouldn\u2019t just be limited to complexion products, and we were surprised we\u2019d never seen it done before!\u2019\n\nThere are three colour combos to choose from to \u2018giving everyone the opportunity to define their own nude\u2019: Nude Light, Nude Medium, and Nude Rich and we refuse to choose a favourite.\n\nThe pigment-packed powders have a mix of five buttery matte shades and four complementary shimmery metallic shades and although it could be argued the colour scheme is pretty predictable, the curated selection of shades and finishes aren\u2019t even a bit boring.\n\nWe\u2019re totally obsessed with the blendable formulas, the everyday wearable shades, the metallics, minimal fallout and the fact you can throw it in your bag (unlike the recent textbook-sized palette launches).\n\nEven better? They\u2019re pretty damn affordable priced at \u00a325 each, which is significantly less than her popular full-sized palettes.\n\nYou can keep it subtle by blending a barely-there shade all over the lid (nude eyeshadow also makes an excellent base for winged eyeliner), smoke it out with a deeper nude, or pair with a metallic to add a touch of shimmering dimension.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nude Obsession Eyeshadow Palettes are sure to become a precious product in your arsenal.\n\nNude Light Nude Obsessions Eyeshadow Palette, \u00a325\n\nA beautiful balance of light and creamy praline hues in both warm and cool tones. Featuring peachy shades with unexpected pops of lavender and mauve.\n\nThe champagne and brown shimmers will add unbelievable dimension to each and every look.\n\n(Picture: Huda Beauty)\n\nNude Medium Nude Obsessions Eyeshadow Palette, \u00a325\n\nHuda\u2019s favorite, this versatile palette is a rich mix of spicy tones combining chestnuts and deep browns.\n\nFeaturing metallic shimmers in warm yellow and rose gold tones, rustic copper, dusty pink, coral and unique terracotta shades.\n\n(Picture: Huda Beauty)\n\nNude Rich Nude Obsessions Eyeshadow Palette, \u00a325\n\nA dreamy collection of rich, creamy matte shades inclusive of milky and dark chocolate browns, crimson red, dusty rose and sandy fawn with pink undertones.\n\nBurnished gold, blushed bronze, dusty rose and deep brown metallics complete the palette with shimmer and dimension.\n\n(Picture: Huda Beauty)\n\nThe Huda Beauty Nude Obsessions Palettes (\u00a325), launch on 9th October online at shophudabeauty.com and 15th October online at cultbeauty.co.uk and feelunique.com\n\nMORE: Lady Gaga\u2019s new makeup line just dropped on Amazon\n\nMORE: Makeup brush brand Zoeva just launched its own foundation with an inspiring campaign\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Everything to know about the new Huda Beauty nude palettes for every skin tone.", "authors": ["Emily Knott"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88889515_1570521739.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
