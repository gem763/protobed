He said the bill would force the state to rely on old science and would imperil the complex negotiations between state and federal agencies over how to manage the state\u2019s water.\n\n\u201cNo other state has fought harder to defeat Trump\u2019s environmental policies, and that will continue to be the case,\u201d Newsom said in a veto message.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and environmental advocates said the bill would do neither of those things, saying Newsom was wrong to veto a bill they say he did not understand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder to get good environmental policy out of him than we thought it was,\u201d said Kathryn Phillips, director of the Sierra Club of California.\n\nCalifornia has been battling the Trump administration over environmental policy. Last week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration revoked the state\u2019s authority to set its own emission standards for cars and trucks. Newsom and state attorney general Xavier Becerra have already sued to block that move.\n\nEarlier this week, the US Environmental Protection Agency blamed California for a backlog of plans detailing how it would combat air pollution, threatening to withdraw the state\u2019s federal road funding if state officials did not get its act together.\n\nOn Thursday, the EPA accused California of failing to protect its water from pollution, in part because of an increasing homeless population.\n\nNewsom and other state officials have pushed back, declaring Trump is intentionally trying to harm California\u2019s residents.\n\nOn Wednesday, 17 states including California filed a lawsuit seeking to block Trump\u2019s proposed rules they say would weaken the Endangered Species Act.", "description": "Bill would have helped state regulators counter federal directives on environmental issues but Gavin Newsom vows to continue fight", "authors": ["Associated Press In Sacramento"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63e7f7a9c590391db2ad373d58fee203b9f8b340/0_102_2248_1349/master/2248.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ee303cbf5e99863c4dad0791ec1a2ecd", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
