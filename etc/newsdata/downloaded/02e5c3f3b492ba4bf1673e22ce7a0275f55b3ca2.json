He had no idea how expensive those vacations were until he heard from New York tax collectors.\n\nA state administrative law judge ruled last month that Mr. Obus owed $527,000 in back New York state income tax because of his upstate home. With interest and penalties, that is more than twice the $290,000 he paid for the house in 2011.\n\nMr. Obus, a principal and chief investment officer of Wynnefield Capital, lives in Princeton, N.J. But he was required to pay New York state taxes on all his income, under the ruling, like any New York resident.\n\nThe few days he spent each year in the Adirondacks turned him into a state resident, for tax purposes, the judge ruled. The vacation home in Northville, N.Y., is more than 200 miles from his Manhattan office, making it too far to commute.\n\n\u201cThis really fits into the whole realm of government overreach,\u201d Mr. Obus said in an interview.\n\nThe judge\u2019s decision reflects stepped-up enforcement by state auditors in recent years against wealthy individuals who have ties to New York but don\u2019t pay taxes as residents, said Robert Willens, a tax and accounting consultant who publishes a tax newsletter.\n\n\u201cThis is their favorite hunting ground,\u201d Mr. Willens said.\n\nA spokesman for the State Department of Taxation and Finance declined to comment on the case.\n\nIn the ruling, Donna M. Gardiner, an administrative law judge, said that Mr. Obus used the Northville home only for vacation purposes and spent no more than two or three weeks there.\n\nBut Ms. Gardiner added that under New York state law, the house qualified as a \u201cpermanent place of abode.\u201d\n\nThe law exempts \u201ca mere camp or cottage\u201d suitable and used only for vacations, but she said it didn\u2019t qualify. She cited the home\u2019s \u201cyear-round climate control.\u201d\n\nGlenn Newman, a tax lawyer at Greenberg Traurig who represented Mr. Obus, said that during two years covered by the audit, 2012 and 2013, Mr. Obus worked out his Manhattan office and had filed a New York tax return for income earned in the state.\n\nAt issue in the audit was income from interest, dividends and capital gains, which were already taxed by the state of New Jersey, he said.\n\nNew York law treats taxpayers as state residents if their primary residence is there, or if they are present in the state for any part of 183 days in the year and have a permanent home there.\n\nThe house has five bedrooms, three baths and includes an apartment used by a year-round tenant. It is located on the edge of golf course, about a block from a large reservoir, and is around 60 miles northwest of Albany.\n\nMr. Newman disputed the judge\u2019s ruling. He said that the house was obviously used as a vacation house and shouldn\u2019t be considered a permanent home for tax purposes under New York law.\n\nMr. Obus vowed to appeal the tax decision, and he has beaten back charges against him before. He spent a dozen years successfully battling an insider-trading claim by the Securities and Exchange Commission. (The securities case ended in a trial and an acquittal in 2014.)\n\nIn addition to arguing that his vacation home shouldn\u2019t count, he has also been limiting his time in New York to less than 183 days a year, forcing him, he said, to \u201cboycott\u201d the state part of the year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is in the interest of the state of New York to see me leave Northville,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Amagansett,\u201d he added, referring to an affluent hamlet on the east end of Long Island. \u201cThese are chronically economically depressed areas and they depend on vacationers like me.\u201d\n\nWrite to Josh Barbanel at josh.barbanel@wsj.com", "description": "Hedge-fund manager Nelson Obus liked to stay at his cottage in the Adirondacks during cross-country ski trips.
