While U.S. dairy milk consumption has fallen, cheese consumption keeps on increasing year over year. According to an Agriculture Department report from 2018, per capita cheese consumption increased to a record 37.23 pounds. If you\u2019re a die-hard cheese fan, you\u2019re probably consuming your mozzarella and ricotta (Italian cheese are now the most popular in the United States) with a side of guilt. After all, cheese has long gotten a bad rap because of its high saturated fat content, which is considered bad for heart health.\n\nResearch is starting to suggest, however, that the issue may be more complex. One study published in 2018 showed dairy fats such as cheese had a neutral-to-positive effect on the heart. A 2018 review from Harvard researchers concluded there was a \u201cnull or weak inverse association between consumption of dairy products and risk of cardiovascular disease,\u201d though it said more research was needed. A study from the Lancet medical journal found dairy products such as cheese were linked to a lower mortality risk.\n\n[From fish to bacon, a ranking of animal proteins in order of healthfulness]\n\nAccording to Jennifer Glockner, a registered dietitian and creator of the Smartee Plate, recent studies have indicated \u201cthat cheese may actually offer protective properties on the heart,\u201d though she also noted that they were observational and did not prove cause and effect. Cheese does provide some beneficial nutrients, she said, \u201cincluding protein; calcium for bone and teeth health; zinc, which promotes wound-healing and immunity; vitamin A for eye and skin health, and B12.\u201d\n\nNone of this means you should start consuming cheese indiscriminately; you should take care when adding it to your diet. Which cheeses are most healthful? It can be tough to offer hard-and-fast guidelines because each variety has its own nutritional profile, and cheeses can be broken up into categories in myriad ways, whether you group them by the kind of rind, milk source or production style. But with the help of experts, we\u2019ve come up with some general guidelines, as well as other factors to consider when making cheese part of a healthy diet.\n\nRanking by healthfulness\n\nFresh cheese. If you\u2019re looking for the leanest option, your best bet is fresh cheese. Such unripened cheeses include goat cheese, feta, ricotta and cottage cheese. \u201cThese cheeses are produced by the coagulation of milk and cream by chemical or culture acidification, or a combination of chemical acidification and high heat treatment,\u201d says Nicole Magryta, a registered dietitian and author of \u201cNourish Your Tribe: Empowering Parents to Grow Strong, Smart, Successful Kids.\u201d \u201cThey also tend to be lowest in fats and cholesterol.\u201d\n\nA serving of cottage cheese or ricotta will pack a healthy dose of protein, and they\u2019re typically lower in calories; half a cup of cottage cheese is roughly 110 calories. Ricotta is higher in calories \u2014 about 180 calories for half a cup \u2014 but is loaded with calcium. \u201cWhile high in sodium, feta tends to be one of the lowest in calories. Plus, with its strong flavor, you often use less of it than other cheeses,\u201d says Kelli McGrane, a registered dietitian with the weight-loss app Lose It! \u201cGoat cheese is milder in flavor than feta, but also tends to be lower in calories as well as fat.\u201d Depending on how it\u2019s processed, goat cheese can also pack probiotics, which are microorganisms that can aid digestion.\n\nFresh mozzarella, \u201ctends to be one of the lowest in calories and sodium,\u201d McGrane says. \u201cAdditionally, fresh mozzarella contains Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus fermentum, two probiotic strains that are beneficial for gut health.\u201d\n\nHarder cheeses. These hard, fermented cheeses have been aged longer than soft cheese, lending a richer flavor and increasing shelf life. They include varieties such as cheddar, Swiss and Parmesan and tend to be good sources of important vitamins and minerals such as calcium and vitamin A. They also have a modest amount of fat, according to Glockner. \u201cHard cheeses such as cheddar and Parmesan usually have more calcium and less lactose, since the whey is removed during processing,\u201d she explains. That said, though there\u2019s less fat than there is in soft cheese, there\u2019s more sodium.\n\nIf you have lactose sensitivity or suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, hard cheeses such as Parmesan will probably be better for reducing your gut symptoms. Sharon Collison, a registered dietitian and clinical instructor in nutrition at the University of Delaware, says you may end up only wanting a little bit of this variety. \u201cThese cheeses are very low in moisture which increases their shelf life,\u201d Collison says. \u201cThey are generally served grated and can be healthy choices because they have such intense flavor that small portions are usually enough.\u201d\n\nBlue cheese. Blue cheese, which has been ripened with cultures of the mold penicillium, includes varieties such as Stilton and Gorgonzola. It can be considered soft or hard, depending on how it\u2019s processed, and falls somewhere in the middle of the pack in terms of health. \u201cIt\u2019s high in calories, total and saturated fat, yet it is also one of the highest in calcium,\u201d she explains. Again, its potent flavor profile may mean you\u2019re satisfied with less of it.\n\nSofter cheeses. Bloomy, mold-ripened varieties of cheese tend to have a firm rind and creamy interior, as they ripen from the outside in. Although extremely tasty on that cheese plate, soft cheeses such as Camembert, brie and triple-cr\u00e8me (cheese enriched with cream) fall into the \u201cless healthy\u201d category because of their saturated fat content. \u201cA key thing to remember is that the softer the cheese, the higher the fat,\u201d says Emily Tills, a dietitian and nutrition coach. \u201cFat makes things creamier.\u201d It\u2019s also very easy to overeat a gooey brie slathered on a slice of bread with a sweet jam.\n\nProcessed cheeses. In the camp of cheeses better avoided completely, you can toss out the processed types, such as American cheese singles, Velveeta, spray can varieties or shredded cheeses in plastic bags. \u201cThese products shouldn\u2019t even be considered real cheese, as they have been manipulated and engineered and pumped with preservatives,\u201d Magryta says. \u201cSweetened cottage cheeses should also be avoided; labels that read \u2018fruit flavored\u2019 mislead consumers when, in truth, the product is just cheese with sugar, additives and preservatives.\u201d\n\nOther factors to consider\n\nIf eaten in moderation, \u201cquality cheeses can be enjoyed as part of a healthy, whole-food, plant-focused diet,\u201d Magryta says. But there are some factors you can keep in mind to improve the health of your cheese choices.\n\nMagryta suggests keeping portion sizes small. \u201cMost cheeses are between 60 and 90 percent fat and have between 75 and 120 calories per ounce,\u201d she says. \u201cAim to keep your serving size of cheese to 1.5 ounces or less of hard cheeses \u2014 that\u2019s about the size of four dice or a third of a cup shredded \u2014 or a half-cup portion size of cheeses like ricotta or cottage cheese.\u201d\n\nAlso, stick to just one serving a day \u2014 and savor it. \u201cRemember, cheese is not a [primary] source of protein, it is more so a source of fat and sodium,\u201d Amy Shapiro, a registered dietitian and founder of Real Nutrition NYC . \u201cPeople tend to put a health halo on it since it doesn\u2019t contain many carbs, but that doesn\u2019t make it a \u2018free food.\u2019 \u201d If you really love cheese, Shapiro\u2019s favorite way to consume it is by making it \u201cthe star of the show, when it is worth it\u201d instead of adding it as an extra to \u201csandwiches, salads, omelets,\u201d and so on.\n\nExpert opinions differ on whether turning to low-fat cheese is a smart strategy. Though some dietitians continue to recommend low-fat or part-skim options, recent research suggests that this, too, might be a more complex issue. A 2016 study in Circulation linked the real deal to a lower risk of diabetes, and another studypublished the same year linked full-fat cheese consumption with a lower risk of obesity among women.\n\nMagryta recommends choosing full-fat or whole-milk cheese. \u201cWhen the fat is processed out of dairy foods, you lose not only the flavor but the food\u2019s natural ability to keep you full,\u201d she says. \u201cWhole-fat cheese also helps to balance blood sugars, which may have to do with its high amounts of vitamin K, vitamin D and calcium.\u201d Furthermore, low-fat cheese can be \u201ca highly processed food.\u201d Look at the ingredients. Unhealthy additions include acids, emulsifiers, thickeners, stabilizers, gums and other nondairy ingredients to make up for the lost fat. You should be wary if the ingredient list on the cheese feels long.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re consuming cheeses in moderation as part of a diet rich in whole foods, Magryta believes the higher amount of saturated fat shouldn\u2019t be an issue. \u201cThe healthiest cheese depends first on its quality,\u201d she says. \u201cCheeses that are unprocessed, raw, full-fat, grass-fed and certified organic, if possible, are the best. Fermented [or cultured] cheese products are also excellent choices. You don\u2019t always have to have all of these characteristics, but shoot for as many as you can.\u201d\n\nFor specific health needs\n\nThe dietitians we talked to recommended these cheeses to address specific health concerns.\n\nTo reduce sodium: Swiss, goat, Emmental, or Wensleydale\n\nTo boost calcium: Manchego, Emmental, Parmesan, Romano, Gruyere, or Swiss\n\nTo increase protein: cottage cheese, ricotta, Romano or Parmesan\n\nTo boost gut health: Raw, unpasteurized cheddar, feta, Gouda, Edam, caciocavallo, Emmental, or Gruyere\n\nTo cope with lactose sensitivity: hard cheeses such as cheddar, Parmesan, Swiss, asiago, manchego and Pecorino Romano\n\nTo be safe during pregnancy: pasteurized cheeses.\n\nJenna Birch is a journalist, dating coach and the author of \u201cThe Love Gap: A Radical Plan to Win in Life and Love.\u201d", "description": "Americans are consuming more cheese than ever.
