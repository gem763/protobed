That might be because Mackereth treats his patients respectfully and according to their medical needs \u2014 as he ought. But when Mackereth applied for a job as a disability assessor in a medical center run by the British government\u2019s Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), he ran into serious trouble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA \u201ctrainer\u201d instructed him on a hypothetical scenario. If he were to encounter a transgender patient, the trainer said, he must refer to that patient, both in person and in writing (in medical records), by whichever pronouns and prefixes the individual preferred (such as he or she, they or ze). As a doctor, Mackereth, was worried this was not in his patient\u2019s best interests. And as a Christian, Mackereth felt that he was unable to lie. He told the trainer that if such an instance arose, he would be unable to comply. His dissent was not well received.\n\n\u201cAfter some discussion\u201d with the DWP, Mackereth told me, \u201cI was given the opportunity to change my mind and I said in good conscience, as a Christian, I can\u2019t do that. And I was told that my services would not be required.\u201d\n\nBelieving that he\u2019d been unfairly discriminated against, Mackereth took legal action. But an employment judge decided against him in July, issuing its decision last week. Mackereth is not backing down. \u201cWe will take this as far as we have to, or as far as we possibly can,\u201d he says. After all, as the British journalist Dan Hitchens noted wryly:\n\nJudges, like comedians, seem ever more convinced that their role in society is to broadcast their political opinions. As Jonathan Sumption put it in his Reith Lectures, the judiciary often resemble a \u201cpriestly caste\u201d who want their liberal values to be raised to the level of \u201cfundamental human rights.\u201d\n\nIt is true that a growing portion of the British judiciary (not unlike its American counterpart) is indistinguishable from the trials-by-media circus. Often, if they differ at all, it\u2019s simply a matter of tone.\n\nDuring the hearing in July, for instance, Piers Morgan of Good Morning Britain invited the mild-mannered Mackereth on his show, only to call him a \u201cbigot,\u201d which Morgan defined \u2014 with zero self-awareness, evidently \u2014 as \u201ca person who is woefully intolerant of people.\u201d Morgan then blithely explained (to the medical doctor with nearly three decades of experience) that transgender people go through an \u201cextraordinarily long and painful transition process both physically and psychologically, and they do it because fundamentally they believe they were born in the wrong body.\u201d\n\nMACKERETH: Well, the Bible tells us that God has made us male and female. He made us for His own glory. And if I\u2019m a bigot, then the whole of Christianity throughout history is bigotry. I don\u2019t believe that. I believe Christianity is the truth of God. MORGAN: The Bible says if you look at people in an adulterous manner you should be stoned to death. Do you agree with that? . . . Given your self-righteousness, do you wander round the streets of your city now looking for people who are looking at people in a lustful way and stone them to death? And if not, why not? MACKERETH: You haven\u2019t established that I\u2019m self-righteous. I\u2019m a sinner saved by the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ, so I carry the righteousness of Jesus Christ. I long for the same thing for everybody to have what I have, which is to know Him. That includes people of every kind of background. But you\u2019re right, if we were to apply the Bible literally without taking its context, then every one of us could be stoned to death. Every one of us has broken God\u2019s commandments. MORGAN: Have you ever looked at people in a lustful way? MACKERETH: [Laughing] Of course I have! MORGAN: Well then, applying the letter of the law and the letter of the Bible, you should now stone yourself to death.\n\nMackereth was not able to respond to this because Morgan and his fellow panelists cut him off and took to sneering. If he has been able to get in a word edgewise, he might have explained that the Bible is not a straightforward manual of morals. Rather, it is, as Bishop Barron once put it, a library. And when you\u2019re in a library, do you read the history section in the same way as the poetry section? And do you read the poetry section in the same way as the science section?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTruth, as it happens, can take many forms and can touch on many spheres of life, from psychology to physics. The moral truth that babies are innocent is unlike the scientific truth that the earth is round, but it does not necessarily follow that one is more or less true than the other. Often such truths are complementary. This is the beauty of literature, in fact \u2014 and the reason that thoughtful agnostics (such as Jordan Peterson) and clever atheists (like Camille Paglia) so esteem the Bible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here\u2019s an interesting consideration, besides: The reason Mackereth feels so strongly about pronouns \u2014 strongly enough to lose his job over it and to be mocked mercilessly on national television \u2014 is that he believes that the immutability of sex is both a moral and a scientific truth. This is why it would be an oversight to think that this was only about Mackereth\u2019s Christianity. His case raises important questions for all of us.\n\nShould the judiciary, on behalf of the state, compel people to say things they don\u2019t believe to be materially and morally true? Should the judiciary, on behalf of the state, compel people to tell lies about serious things? If a resounding no is still heard throughout democratic nations, it perhaps helps explain why it isn\u2019t merely a handful of fundamentalist Christians who worry about enforced transgender pronouns.\n\nMackereth told me that many of his colleagues were \u201cabsolutely thrilled\u201d that he\u2019d taken a stand:\n\nI\u2019m not saying everyone agrees with me, and I\u2019m certainly not expecting everybody to agree with me, but I\u2019m working in the accidents and emergency room, and we have very tight-knit teams. And there was this outpouring of thankfulness [from colleagues who aren\u2019t Christian] that somebody had said something. If you were to multiply this across the whole NHS in England, Wales, and Scotland \u2014 that\u2019s a very strong body of opinion that what\u2019s happening is wrong. As I\u2019ve said time and again, there are two things here: My Christian conviction, which tells me I cannot lie. And my medical, scientific training, which tells me that there isn\u2019t a doctor, researcher, or philosopher in the world who could demonstrate or prove that somebody could change sex. It\u2019s actually impossible.\n\n*****\n\nGiven the immense seriousness of a law compelling speech in this way, it is useful to parse this judgement bit by bit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I noted above, Mackereth frames his dissent in religious terms primarily because this is his strongest moral motivation. However, as far as legal strategy is concerned, a religiously framed defense is also his best defense. It might not win him any friends on Good Morning Britain, but religion remains one of the protected characteristics under the U.K.\u2019s most powerful anti-discrimination law, the Equality Act of 2010.\n\nPrior to the Equality Act, the U.K. had three significant pieces of legislation to ward off discrimination: the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975, primarily intended for women; the Race Relations Act of 1979; and the Disability Discrimination Act of 1995. The Equality Act of 2010 was designed to be more comprehensive: to protect citizens from \u201cdirect or indirect discrimination, harassment and victimisation\u201d on the basis of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, or sex.\n\nWhat is fascinating (if entirely foreseeable) in Mackereth v. DWP, of course, is a violent clash of rights. Mackereth has a right to protection under \u201creligion or belief,\u201d while the imaginary transgender patient (hypothetically conceived in the mind of an activist trainer) has the right to protection (not only from discrimination but from offense, which we\u2019ll return to later) in relation to \u201cgender reassignment.\u201d\n\nThe legal precedent for a case like this, as referred to throughout the judgment, comes from Grainger v. Nicolson, argued in 2010. In Grainger, Nicolson\u2019s lawyers successfully argued that his belief in climate change was a philosophical position worthy of protection under the \u201creligion or belief\u201d clause of the Equality Act. Nicolson\u2019s environmentalism was then used to establish the following criteria for the category of \u201cbelief\u201d:\n\nThat it be \u201cgenuinely held.\u201d\n\nThat it be a belief and not an opinion or viewpoint (e.g., this or that political affiliation or preference.)\n\nThat it be concerning \u201ca weighty and substantial aspect of human life and behavior.\u201d\n\nThat it have \u201ca certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance.\u201d\n\nThat it be \u201cworthy of respect in a democratic society [and] be not incompatible with human dignity and not conflict with the fundamental rights of others\u201d (emphasis added).\n\nIn setting out the scope and limitations of the criteria, Grainger established that \u201cracist\u201d and \u201chomophobic\u201d philosophies could be comfortably disqualified as a belief requiring legal protection, while scientifically informed philosophies such as Darwinism could be comfortably incorporated as a belief. The employment judge of Grainger explained: \u201cIt is not the function of the Tribunal to examine the beliefs of Claimants appearing before it. Instead it is the function of the Tribunal to analyse those beliefs to see whether they engage relevant legislation.\u201d In other words: Don\u2019t worry, everyone. Our standards may appear really subjective and suspectable to bias, but they\u2019re totally not.\n\nThey totally are, though. To return to Mackereth, we see how Grainger is being applied politically. Hedging his bets somewhat, Mackereth complained of both direct and indirect harassment under the Equality Act\u2019s provision for religion. The tribunal\u2019s judgment notes that he listed three of his beliefs:\n\nHis belief in the truth of the Bible, and in particular, the truth of Genesis 1:27: \u201cSo God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.\u201d It follows that every person is created by God as either male or female. A person cannot change their sex/gender at will. Any attempt at, or pretence of, doing so, is pointless, self-destructive, and sinful. (\u201cBelief in Genesis 1:27\u201d) Lack of belief (i) that it is possible for a person to change their sex/gender, (ii) that impersonating the opposite sex may be beneficial for an individual\u2019s welfare, and/or (iii) that the society should accommodate and/or encourage anyone\u2019s impersonation of the opposite sex (\u201clack of belief in Transgenderism\u201d) Belief that it would be irresponsible and dishonest for e.g. a health professional to accommodate and/or encourage a patient\u2019s impersonation of the opposite sex (\u201cconscientious objection to Transgenderism\u201d) [Emphasis added.]\n\n(Note that the last point is necessarily grouped with the first two points, in order to meet the criteria for \u201creligion or belief\u201d set by Grainger.) The judges accept that Mackereth\u2019s Christian faith is genuinely held, that it is a belief, and that it is weighty and is serious. But on the last clause of Grainger, they find it unworthy of respect in a democratic society. They explain why.\n\nFirst, Mackereth\u2019s refusal to comply due to conscientious objection (which, in practice, might just mean that he sends transgender patients to \u201cgender-affirming\u201d doctors instead) could still cause \u201coffence or the potential for offence\u201d to a patient and therefore, per Grainger, his refusal \u201cconflicts with the fundamental rights of others, specifically here, transgender individuals.\u201d\n\nSecond, \u201cirrespective of\u201d the fact that Christianity meets all but one of the criteria set out by Grainger, the judges find that \u201cbelief in Genesis 1:27, lack of belief in transgenderism, and conscientious objection to transgenderism in our judgment are incompatible with human dignity.\u201d So the tribunal rules in favor of the DWP, asserting that Mackereth has not been unlawfully discriminated against on the grounds of his religion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I contacted the DWP spokesperson for comment, he provided me with their generic statement also given to the BBC: \u201cWe acted to protect claimants from behavior that would have failed to treat them with dignity, so we welcome this ruling. We expect all assessors to approach their work sensitively.\u201d\n\nI wanted to ask him how, exactly, the DWP was defining \u201cdignity,\u201d since Mackereth has a competing definition \u2014 one that\u2019s been around much longer. However the DWP is defining \u201cdignity,\u201d it\u2019s clearly not giving any of it to Mackereth, whose rights have been trampled into dust. I also wanted to ask the DWP which \u201cclaimants\u201d they were hoping to \u201cprotect,\u201d since \u2014 again \u2014 this was an entirely hypothetical situation. But the spokesman explained that he would be issuing no further comment.\n\nMore remarkable still, the judges have concluded this case without demonstrating that they themselves are confident about what language ought to be used when describing transgender people. They adopt the term \u201ctransgender\u201d while admitting inconsistent usage with the earlier term \u201ctranssexual\u201d found in the Equality Act. And at one point they confuse \u201cbirth sex\u201d with identified sex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss this as sloppiness \u2014 just some badly decided judgement in a small city in a small country that is of little consequence. But it is not so. The judges in question (smart people) spent three months trying to write this judgement as carefully as they could, trying to interpret legal case law, and they still managed to butcher it.\n\nThey aren\u2019t the only ones struggling, of course. Last month, a liberal British journalist tried to tell off the National Review Institute\u2019s Douglas Murray for not believing in \u201cnon-binary\u201d people, and the journalist simultaneously managed to misgender Sam Smith as a \u201che\u201d (instead of Smith\u2019s newfound preference for \u201cthey\u201d). Before that, during a Democratic-primary debate, Julian Castro managed to champion \u201cabortion rights\u201d for transgender women (who, being male, are not themselves physically capable of having abortions). I almost feel sorry for these woke cultural scolds. How stressful it must be! Knowing that you\u2019re only ever one misgendering episode away from social annihilation.\n\nWe may feel vindicated when a progressive is hoisted on ziz/zer own petard. But in the judiciary, it\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s a bloody mess, a bloody mess with very bloody consequences. Welcome to the era of compelled speech.
