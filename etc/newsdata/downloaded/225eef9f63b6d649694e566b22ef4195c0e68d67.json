The speech is one of the few addresses the seventy-six-year-old candidate has given since the start of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. While described as a public town hall by the Biden campaign, the actual event resembled a rally, and the candidate took no questions from the press or audience.\n\nDuring his speech, Biden described the founding of the United States and how worried the founding fathers were about foreign influence by European powers.\n\n\u201cAt the time, one of the biggest concerns was that foreign nations would interfere in our democracy, in our experiment. That\u2019s why we have an emoluments clause, to prevent presidents from being secretly bribed or paid off by foreign governments. In his farewell address, George Washington specifically warned against foreign nations meddling in our affairs,\u201d said Biden, before quoting part of the address.\n\n\u201cOver two hundred plus years has followed, and we have been vigilant to keep foreign nations out of our elections. That was until President Donald Trump,\u201d claimed Biden. There have been accusations of foreign government involvement on behalf of U.S. presidential campaigns in the past, including the United Kingdom in 1940, South Vietnam in 1968, and Iran in 1980.\n\n\u201cLast week, on the White House lawn, President Trump invited China to get engaged in deciding our election and who our nominee would be,\u201d specified Biden.\n\nAs described, speaking impromptu to reporters, Trump said, \u201cAnd by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens. Because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d He was referring to business dealings involving Hunter Biden which took place shortly after Hunter traveled with his father to China on an official visit in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt was the third foreign power (that we know of) that he\u2019s asked in clear, unmistakable language to interfere on behalf of the democratic proceedings in the United States of America,\u201d continued Biden. He was referring to Trump\u2019s comment on China, his phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in July, and Trump\u2019s comment from the 2016 campaign that if Russia or any other government possessed the thirty-three thousand emails Hillary Clinton deleted from her State Department server, they should release them.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Biden believes that Trump is singling him out because he\u2019s the most competitive Democrat in next year\u2019s election.", "authors": ["Hunter Derensis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/g0.SeqPUz_cBMwbasLNKrQ--~B/aD0xMDQzO3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/bbac33e768062b803f55dfdab4bce66d", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
