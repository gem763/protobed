All you have to do is is type \u201ccal.new\u201d or \u201cmeeting.new\u201d in Google chrome to be taken straight to the Calendar event creation page. No more having to navigate through the calendar and fiddle around with extra settings.\n\nThe coolest part: These shortcuts can even be used across multiple accounts. If you\u2019re signed in to multiple Google accounts on Chrome and want to schedule something on more than one profile, all you have to do is add a number to the end of the shortcut that corresponds to the account you want to save the event to. For example, \u201ccal.new/1/\u201d or \u201cmeeting.new/1/1\" saves to the first account synced to Chrome, \u201ccal.new/2/\u201d will save it to the second, and so on. This works without having to switch between accounts in the Chrome settings.\n\nThis should make scheduling and managing your Google Calendar events a lot easier. Similar shortcuts also exist for tons of other Google apps, including Google Docs, Slides, and more, and we\u2019ll be rounding up all of them in a future post.", "description": "Google Calendar has two new shortcut functions that make scheduling new events or meetings easy.
