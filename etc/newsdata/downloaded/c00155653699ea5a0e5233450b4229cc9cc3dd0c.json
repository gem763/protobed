Today, glistening in the midday sun, they are at peace as they wind their way through the village and out to sea.\n\nDavid ushers me up the steep stone steps to the Memorial Hall, site of the former lifeboat station and now home to a permanent flood disaster exhibition.\n\nNearly 70 years on, the power of water is being harnessed to produce electricity at Glen Lyn Gorge, reputedly the largest privately owned hydroelectric power scheme in England and Wales. The amount of kilowatts fed back into the National Grid from here is enough to supply the entire village.\n\nAfter enjoying the exhibition, I wander along the path further into the wooded gorge, admiring waterfalls along the way. The sound of the river reverberates through the ravine.\n\nThe scenery is just as impressive as I stroll by the banks of the East Lyn river. I set my sights on National Trust-owned Watersmeet House for a cream tea. Just less than two miles east of Lynmouth, it\u2019s located in yet another tree-clad river gorge \u2014 this time, one of the UK\u2019s deepest.\n\nSurrounded by precipitous valley walls, Watersmeet House was built in 1832 as a fishing lodge by Reverend Walter Halliday, devotee of Romantic poetry and friend of poet Robert Southey. Such was the owner\u2019s love of verse that he had lines from a Wordsworth poem inscribed over the doorway.\n\nLynmouth in Devon bestrides the confluence of the West and East Lyn rivers and was the site of a disaster flood in 1952\n\nLater, I stroll down Lynmouth\u2019s main street and it\u2019s easy to see why the area is called \u2018Little Switzerland\u2019, with its abundance of Victorian buildings, many adorned with Swiss-style balconies.\n\nThe nickname originates, apparently, from Robert Southey who, on visiting the village in 1799, noted there was something distinctly Alpine in its appearance.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly all hills around here \u2014 which prompts me to jump aboard the water-powered funicular railway to reach Lynton, sitting directly above Lynmouth.\n\nRunning on 862 ft of track, the Cliff Railway opened in 1890 to help transport freight.\n\nFrom Lynton, I join the South West Coast Path, England\u2019s longest waymarked long-distance footpath. Dotted around the precipitous cliffs stretching to the sea are wild goats. They scatter as I approach.\n\nEventually I reach a magical corner of Exmoor, evocatively called Valley of Rocks. Only a mile from the hilltop town of Lynton, it\u2019s striking how different the landscape is to the rest of Exmoor: a secret world tucked away under the shelter of surrounding hills.\n\nThe jagged, spiky rocks, with such intriguing names as Chimney Rock, Ragged Jack and Devil\u2019s Cheesewring, are just another factor in the contrasting and thrilling make-up of Exmoor.", "description": "The Daily Mail's Richard Webber visited the\u00a0coastal towns of Lynton and Lynmouth.
