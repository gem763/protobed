Bernie Sanders leads Trump by 48 percent to 44 percent, while Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala D. Harris are both dead even with him.\n\nAD\n\nOn immigration, the poll finds that 65 percent of Wisconsin voters think \u201chaving an increasing number of people of many different races, ethnic groups and nationalities in the United States makes this country a better place to live.\u201d By contrast, 27 percent say those things make no difference (and only 4 percent say they make the United States worse).\n\nCharles Franklin, the director of the Marquette poll, told me that this represents an increase of 12 points compared to 2016, when only 53 percent of Wisconsin voters said those things made the United States a better place.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou\u2018ll find a lot of evidence that the society has become more positive to immigrants and minorities in the last three years, not less positive,\u201d Franklin told me.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Franklin said, there has been a shift in which Republicans haven\u2019t moved much but \u201cDemocrats and some independents have moved away from the president and to a more pro-immigration and pro-minority position.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFranklin noted that you often see voters shifting against whatever ideology a president espouses, but \u201ca more traditional president, with a more constrained speaking style, may not have as big an effect that Trump has had.\u201d\n\nOn trade, the poll finds that among Wisconsin voters, only 30 percent say tariffs help the economy, while 46 percent say they hurt, and another 17 percent say they don\u2019t make much difference \u2014 putting a solid majority in the camp that says they hurt or do nothing.\n\nAD\n\nAmong pure independents, Franklin tells me, 47 percent say the tariffs hurt, while only 34 percent say they help. That\u2019s a small slice of the Wisconsin electorate, Franklin noted, but they can be important in a \u201cstate that\u2019s often decided by one or two percentage points.\u201d\n\nFranklin pointed out that in Wisconsin, \u201cagriculture and manufacturing are both important export sectors,\u201d which could help explain why trade has become a \u201cchallenging\u201d issue for Trump, even in this Midwestern state he won. \u201cThese restrictions that are reducing exports are having a real impact,\u201d Franklin noted.\n\nAD\n\nStill, there\u2019s a nuance here, and it goes to the ways in which Trump is further polarizing the electorate along rural-versus-suburban/metropolitan lines.\n\nAD\n\nFranklin points out that the data show that Republicans are somewhat more united behind Trump now than in 2016, and that there are not signs that the rural parts of the state are edging away from Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection chances, Franklin argued, turn on whether he can do \u201ceven better this time\u201d in the northern and western rural parts of the state, which have been \u201ctrending more Republican.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe trouble is that the Republican suburbs around Milwaukee, and to a lesser extent around Green Bay, have been trending in a more Democratic direction,\u201d Franklin pointed out. \u201cThe trade-off battle in the state\u201d turns on whether he can \u201che run up the margins in those rural areas\u201d without losing too much support in the suburbs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd suburban voters, Franklin said, are more likely the people alienated by tariffs. \u201cThey\u2019re not so thrilled on the trade issues,\u201d he said. In other words, this is another way Trump is likely exacerbating that rural-metropolitan divide.\n\nRegardless, this surely isn\u2019t where Trump expected to be in a state like Wisconsin, which (we are endlessly told) Trump snatched by employing a kind of performative populist nationalism that showed he recognized latent sentiments among the electorate that elitist Democrats did not.\n\nNow that this nationalism has collided with reality, it looks as if it isn\u2019t playing as well as he might have hoped \u2014 right in a state that is thought of as the heart of Trump country.\n\nRead more:\n\nDavid Byler: Why Democrats are stuck competing in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin\n\nAnna Clark: Why should Wisconsin drain Lake Michigan for Foxconn?\n\nJennifer Rubin: Trump has angered the wrong people: Farmers\n\nE.J.
