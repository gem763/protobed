Katie Hill's (D-CA) alleged extra-marital affair with a congressional staffer. The announcement was made after intimate photos of Hill were posted online without her consent.\n\nIt turns out Hill isn't the only Democrat that's being investigated.\n\nThe Committee on Thursday announced its investigation into Delegate Michael San Nicolas of Guam had an affair with a staffer.\n\nThe Committee is aware of public allegations that Delegate Michael F. Q. San Nicolas may have engaged in a sexual relationship with an individual on his congressional staff, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted improper or excessive campaign contributions. The Committee, pursuant to Committee Rule 18(a), has begun an investigation and will gather additional information regarding the allegations.\n\nAccording to Pacific Daily News, John Paul Manuel, San Nicolas' former senatorial chief of staff and congressional campaign manager, said the delegate used campaign funds on an extra-martial affair with a congressional staffer.\n\nManuel made a post about the affair on San Nicolas' Facebook page. In the post, he claimed he spent a number of years helping cover up the affair. While he never reported the improprieties, he said he was unsure whether or not he would file a formal complaint with the House Ethics Committee.\n\n\"There's no good time to tell about a friend\u2019s wrongdoing. But the truth needed to come out and it came out when it did and if people feel that there is any political motivation behind this, they should know that I'm risking my entire career and my life on this and there's probably no positive career outcome for me in this except that it is just the truth,\" Manuel told the Daily News.\n\nHouse Rule XXIII, clause 18(a) clearly states a Delegate cannot engage in a sexual relationship with an employee:\n\n18. (a) A Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner may not engage in a sexual relationship with any employee of the House who works under the supervision of the Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner, or who is an employee of a committee on which the Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner serves. This paragraph does not apply with respect to any relationship between two people who are married to each other.\n\nSan Nicolas said earlier this year his office was \"contacted and threatened to take certain actions in order to avoid political attacks.\"\n\n\"We refused, and I immediately engaged the FBI. The investigation is ongoing, to include the recent actions taken against me and my family these past several days,\" he told the Daily News.", "description": ".10/26/2019 20:03:26PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/282/7df59b50-7915-4aad-a34b-2da244e66c30.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
