Trump wrestles the person to the floor, before shooting them in the head. In the foreground, former FBI director James Comey is seen trying to get out of the way.\n\nThis is just a tiny vignette from a video depicting a character with Trump\u2019s face conducting a violent and bloody attack on people representing media outlets, journalists, former administration officials, and Democratic opponents.\n\nParts of the video were played to Trump supporters at a conference at Trump\u2019s own Miami resort last week that was attended by Donald Trump Jr. and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, according to the organizers of the event.\n\nOn Thursday night, the same day the conference in Florida began, Trump spoke at a rally in Minnesota and decried an \u201cunholy alliance of corrupt Democrat politicians, deep-state bureaucrats, and the fake news media.\u201d\n\nThe video, which was originally posted on YouTube in September 2018 by an account called \u201cLici\u2020us Veri\u2020as Invic\u2020us,\u201d used footage from the 2014 film \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service\u201d and crudely replaced the main character\u2019s face with Trump\u2019s.\n\nThe scene takes place in a church \u2014 dubbed the \u201cChurch of Fake News\u201d in the edited version \u2014 and sees Trump walk up the aisle among a sea of people whose faces have been replaced with logos from media organizations, including CNN, the BBC, MSNBC, BuzzFeed, and many more.\n\nTrump then stops in the middle of the church and pulls a gun out of his suit jacket pocket and begins a graphic rampage, shooting several people in the head at point-blank range. He hits the late Sen. John McCain in the back of the neck and sets Bernie Sanders\u2019 face on fire.\n\nThe bloody scene ends with Trump driving a stake through the head of a character whose face has been replaced with a CNN logo.\n\nTrump, who has ramped up his attacks on the media as calls for his impeachment have grown, has regularly referred to journalists as the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The president caused outrage in 2017 when he tweeted a wrestling video that showed him pummeling a man whose head had been replaced with the CNN logo.\n\nREAD: Trump accused of inciting violence after CNN wrestling tweet\n\nThe video was played at the Trump National Doral Miami resort last week at a conference organized by American Priority.\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association called the video \"vile and dangerous\u201d adding in a statement that \u201call Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the President's political opponents.\u201d\n\nCindy McCain, John McCain's widow, said that the video \"violate[s] every norm our society expects of its leaders.\"\n\nThe organizers of the event confirmed on Sunday the video had been played as part of a \u201cmeme exhibit\u201d but that it was submitted by a third party. \u201cAmerican Priority rejects all political violence and aims to promote a healthy dialogue about the preservation of free speech. This matter is under review,\u201d Alex Phillips, organizer of the event, told the Times.\n\nREAD: Trump\u2019s attempt to stonewall impeachment is collapsing \u2013 fast\n\nDonald Trump Jr. and DeSantis have yet to comment on the video, but Sarah Huckabee Sanders told the New York Times that she did not see it.\n\nOn Monday morning the White House press secretary tweeted that Trump had not yet seen the video but would be seeing it soon, adding, \"Based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video.\"\n\nOthers, however, were quick to point out that the video could lead to real-world violence against those portrayed on screen.\n\n\u201cThis video isn\u2019t funny. It will get people killed,\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, tweeted.\n\n\u201cEvery mother and father in America should watch [the] video,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) tweeted. \u201cPlay it all the way to end. Know that this is the re-election message of your President.\u201d\n\nCover: The crowd applaud as President Donald Trump concludes his speech at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019.
