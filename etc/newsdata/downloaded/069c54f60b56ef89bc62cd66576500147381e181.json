It\u2019s horrible,\u201d the source continued. \u201cWe met every single security agreement. The Kurds met every single agreement. There was no threat to the Turks \u2014 none \u2014 from this side of the border.\u201d\n\nThe death toll continues to mount amid the Turkish airstrikes, artillery fire and ground offensive, the Associated Press reported. Turkey\u2019s President Erdogan was cited by NBC News as saying more than 100 people have been killed.\n\n\u201cThis is insanity. I don\u2019t know what they call atrocities, but they are happening,\u201d the soldier explained to Fox News, adding that American troops are doing \u201cnothing... Just sitting by and watching it unfold.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Griffin\u2019s full report, which went viral on Twitter TWTR, +0.15% :\n\nThis veteran US Special forces soldier has trained indigenous forces on multiple continents.

It's horrible,\" this military source on the ground told me. \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 9, 2019\n\nThis American soldier told me the Kurds have not left their positions guarding the ISIS prisoners. In fact \"they prevented a prison break last night without us.\"\n\n\"They are not abandoning our side (yet).\"\n\nThe Kurds are \"pleading for our support.\" We are doing \"nothing.\" \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 9, 2019\n\nAcc to this US soldier on the ground tonight in Syria: \"The Kurds are as close to Western thinking in the Middle East as anyone. \"It's a shame. It's horrible.\" \"This is not helping the ISIS fight.\" Re: ISIS prisoners: \"Many of them will be free in the coming days and weeks.\" \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 9, 2019", "description": "A Special Forces soldier in Syria described his personal feelings on Wednesday toward the Trump administration\u2019s abrupt decision to pull troops from the...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT063_kurds_MG_20191010112350.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
