Kibet was also at the track that day, and Li kept an eye on Kibet, who had just picked up running.\n\nLi became impressed with both, and Lalang and Kibet starred on Arizona\u2019s cross-country and track and field teams. Then, a few years after they graduated, Lalang and Kibet joined the Army.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Lalang and Kibet were the top finishers at the Army Ten-Miler in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s races, respectively. Lalang finished in 48 minutes and 38 seconds, while Kibet ran 54:05.\n\nThe Army Ten-Miler, celebrating its 35th anniversary, is a 10-mile race that starts and ends near the Pentagon. The race, sponsored by the U.S. Army Military District of Washington, spans across Washington. About 35,000 runners participated Sunday, making it the world\u2019s third-largest 10-mile road race, according to event staff.\n\n\u201cThis is actually a dream come true for me,\u201d said Kibet, 29. \u201cI came from a very humble background. I came to this country, and so many doors opened up for me. For me, being in the Army is giving back to the community.\u201d\n\n\n\nElvin Kibet smiles with her trophy for winning the women\u2019s race.

One of Kibet\u2019s sisters, Sylvia, won the 5,000 meters silver medal at the 2009 IAAF World Championships. Another sister, Hilda, was one of the world\u2019s fastest 10,000 meter runners in 2009.\n\nKibet didn\u2019t consider joining them.\n\n\u201cI thought it was their thing,\u201d Kibet said.\n\nThat changed when Kibet was 19. Kibet\u2019s sisters explained she could obtain a running scholarship in the U.S. while getting an education. So, Kibet started running. She hated it at first, but after a few weeks, she fell in love with the sport.\n\nAfter Kibet\u2019s time trial with Li, she said Li was unmoved. But after reviewing video of Kibet running, Li saw potential and offered her a scholarship. She became a six-time NCAA all-American before graduating in 2015.\n\nKibet joined the Army just over a year ago as a financial management technician. She\u2019s kept up her race training while based at Fort Carson in Colorado.\n\nEarlier this year, Kibet cried when she wore her Army race singlet for the first time, honored to represent the military. Racing while thousands of American supporters cheered made Sunday\u2019s win more special for her.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018I want to be a part of something bigger,\u2019 \u201d said Kibet, a member of the World Class Athlete Program. \u201cI\u2019m actually running for something.\u201d\n\nKibet wasn\u2019t just excited about the race. This weekend was her first time visiting Washington, so she planned to view the White House on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s humbling and an honor to be part of this,\u201d Kibet said. \u201cI\u2019ve always dreamed about doing something special.\u201d\n\nLalang, 28, still trains with Kibet in Colorado. He and his roommate, Benard Keter, entered Sunday\u2019s race aiming to place as the top men\u2019s runners. They accomplished that feat with ease.\n\nKeter, 27, placed second behind Lalang with a time of 49:04, high-fiving spectators before crossing the finish line. While Keter stuck with Lalang for parts of the race, Lalang said he broke away around the seven-mile mark.\n\n\u201cI was ready for this race,\u201d said Lalang, an Army specialist. \u201cI wanted to challenge myself a little bit. I wanted to show the soldiers running a 10-miler in under five-minute pace is possible.\u201d\n\nLalang said he\u2019s run in competitive races the past 10 years, but Sunday\u2019s was one of the most notable due to the fans\u2019 patriotism. Many competitors ran in honor of late family and friends in the Army, donning their names and faces on shirts.\n\n\u201cWhen I see those flags,\u201d Lalang said, \u201cit motivates me.\u201d\n\nWhile humid weather slowed runners the past two years, participants said they benefited from cooler temperatures Sunday. Kibet ran close to two-and-a-half minutes faster than last year\u2019s women\u2019s winner.\n\nHannah Cocchiaro of Columbia, Md., and Maura Linde of Sykesville, Md., rounded out the women\u2019s top three finishers.
