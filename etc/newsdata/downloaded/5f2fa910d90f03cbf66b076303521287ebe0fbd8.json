Yikes, yikes, yikes.\n\nUnfortunately, it just gets worse from here.\n\nAs Diet Prada pointed out, ELLE Germany also misidentified model Naomi Chin Wing as Janaye Furman. And on the magazine\u2019s actual cover? A white woman dressed in black, and the words \u201cBack to Black\u201d.\n\nDiet Prada, who has committed itself to holding huge labels and brands accountable for its actions, put it simply.\n\n\u201cNot a good look, @ellegermany.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe presumably white-led publication declares that \u2018black is back\u2019. Ironic when they, along with much of the fashion industry, have been complicit in denying visibility to black models until relatively recently.\u201d\n\nDiet Prada also highlighted how one of the models featured, Joan Smalls, is a goddamn industry veteran who certainly hasn\u2019t gone anywhere over the past handful of years. Smalls has consistently appeared on Forbes\u2019 highest-paid models of the year lists. In 2018, she ranked in eighth place \u2013 tied with Bella Hadid \u2013 on $8.5 million.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make this stuff up!\u201d DP said.\n\nThe English translation of the blurb, though \u2013 who the fuck approved that?\n\nAdut Akech, who also appears in the feature, called it \u201cSO SICKENING\u201d in a comment on the post.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m over it, honestly,\u201d she added.\n\nEarlier this year, Akech torched Who Magazine after they printed the wrong model \u2013 also a woman of colour \u2013 under her name.\n\nAs you can imagine, ELLE Germany\u2019s IG page has been flooded with furious comments.\n\nNaomi Campbell, the one and only, wrote an open letter to ELLE Germany\u2019s editor-in-chief Sabine Nedelchev, expressing she felt \u201cso sad to see\u201d the issue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said countless of times that we are not a TREND. We are here to STAY. It\u2019s ok to celebrate models of colour but please do it in an ELEGANT and RESPECTFUL way.\n\nCampbell shared that she had also experienced misidentification throughout her career because of the colour of her skin.\n\n\u201cVery disappointing to say the least. If you would like a conversation to know how to have a diverse mind we are here to sit and accomodate. It\u2019s very important for a publication to be culturally sensitive and give credit where it\u2019s due.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, ELLE Germany has yet to comment on the feature / entire issue.", "description": "Diet Prada has called out ELLE Germany for a deeply fucked fashion feature that ran in the magazine's November 2019 issue.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/ELLE-Germany-cover.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
