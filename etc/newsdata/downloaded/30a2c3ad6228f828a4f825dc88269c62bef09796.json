The 4-year old girl then grabbed it from the youngest child and threw it across the room and away from the 3-year-old, according to the Port St. Lucie Police in a statement on Facebook.\n\nThe knife then struck the TV, bounced off of the stand and hit the 9-year-old boy in the back of the head causing a half inch cut, police said.\n\nAnother child saw that the boy was bleeding heavily from the back of the head and immediately tried to call his mother and grandmother for help.\n\nBut neither Pierre nor Belliard answered their phones, police said.\n\nPort St. Lucie Police Department\n\nPanicked, the child tried to call police for help but instead of dialing 9-1-1, they managed to dial 9-9-1 instead.\n\nAn 8-year-old boy then ran out of the house to a neighbor\u2019s residence to get help.\n\n\"I mean, he was just bleeding everywhere from the head. \u2026 so it was scary,\" said neighbor Kristin Pusateri to ABC West Palm Beach affiliate WPBF.\n\nPusateri said she and her mother were watching television when the 8-year old boy came to them.\n\n\"The 8-year-old came and actually opened our front door and came in and was like, 'My brother is bleeding,'\" Pusateri said.\n\nIt was then that Pusateri and her mother ran to the home to check on the children and discovered that the 5 kids were there with no adults and no supervision.\n\nThey decided to bring all five children, including the 9-year-old victim, over to their home, according to WPBF.\n\n\"They all came in,\" Pusateri said. \"We just wrapped his head in a towel just to stop the bleeding and just waited for the cops to show up.\"\n\nThe cops arrived quickly, according to Pusateri.\n\nWhen the authorities arrived, the 9-year-old victim was flown to St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center and treated for non-life threatening injuries.\n\nBut, to make matters worse, when police began to conduct their investigation they said they noticed that the 5 children were unwashed and unkempt, had several bug bites on their legs and were living in deplorable conditions.\n\nThe Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) were called in to conduct an investigation where it was deemed that the children were in harm\u2019s way and removed from the home.\n\nThe children are now in the care of DCF while Belliard and Pierre have been arrested and charged with Child Neglect.", "description": "A mother and grandmother have been arrested after leaving 5 children between the ages of 3 and 9 home alone and a 9-year-old boy was stabbed by a 4-year-old girl.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/Pierre-belliard-ht-er-190922_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
