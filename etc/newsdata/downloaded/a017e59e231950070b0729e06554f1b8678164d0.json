We\u2019ll split the analysis into three groups: very cheap, mid-tier, and expensive. A greater emphasis will be placed on the lower end of the price scale.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Stay ahead of the competition from wire to wire with rankings, customizable projections, trade evaluator, exclusive columns and more in our Season Pass. And start using optimized lineups with our DFS Toolkit!\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLet\u2019s focus on the seven-game evening slate. Philadelphia and Minnesota aren\u2019t entirely in the clear. Some rain is possible at both venues, although the risk of a postponement is minimal.\n\nDIRT CHEAP BARGAINS\n\nJustin Dunn \u2013 SP \u2013 Seattle Mariners (vs Reds)\n\nThe Mariners have announced their top pitching prospect will piggyback with Tom Milone for the remainder of the season. It\u2019s not yet clear who will serve as the opener and who will take the bulk of the innings. Since it\u2019s an American League game, the Mariners have a lot of flexibility. In all probability, Dunn won\u2019t come anywhere near five innings and thus won\u2019t be a viable play. However, if he\u2019s following Milone, the elevated chance for a win combined with his strikeout stuff is sufficient to tease solid DFS value out of the bargain bin. A four-inning relief appearance can be expected to include three to five strikeouts and around a one-third chance for a win.\n\nIf you prefer a more straightforward play, Reds starter Tyler Mahle is priced even cheaper than Dunn and projects to post a comparable point total.\n\nStory continues\n\nGavin Lux \u2013 2B \u2013 Los Angeles Dodgers (at Dylan Bundy)\n\nAlthough he looks like he belongs in the majors, Lux has yet to do much for his DFS subscribers. Tonight, things might change. He\u2019s a ground ball hitter set to face one of the most consistently homer prone fly ball pitchers in the league. Lux has amply demonstrated his ability to work counts and make frequent, hard contact. He has a better than one-in-four chance for a home run with plenty of other good outcomes on the table. If we\u2019re lucky, he won\u2019t hit near the bottom of the lineup. Even if he does, he\u2019s plenty playable.\n\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. \u2013 3B \u2013 Toronto Blue Jays (vs Make Shawaryn)\n\nRowdy Tellez \u2013 1B \u2013 Toronto Blue Jays (vs Make Shawaryn)\n\nThe Red Sox are barely pretending to use major league quality pitchers these days. Shawaryn is a homer prone fly ball pitcher. This is a fantastic matchup for Vladito. For all his prodigious raw power, his output has been sapped by a too-high ground ball rate. Facing a (bad) Triple-A quality pitcher should jumpstart the ol\u2019 power stroke. While a fly ball pitcher isn\u2019t ideal for Tellez \u2013 he\u2019s at an increased risk for easy fly outs \u2013 Shawaryn isn\u2019t the sort of pitcher whom we need to worry too much about various splits. He\u2019s just flat bad. Any Blue Jays hitter could go off tonight. The Red Sox will likely use a shaky opener ahead of Shawaryn and quickly dip into their equally fragile bullpen.\n\nAlso Consider: Mahle, Drew Smyly, Jesus Aguilar, Matt Duffy, Seth Brown, Willy Adames, Abraham Toro, Josh VanMeter\n\nMID-TIER MUST PLAYS\n\nJ.D. Martinez \u2013 OF \u2013 Boston Red Sox (at Clay Buchholz)\n\nMartinez is one of the likeliest hitters to swat a big fly. He projects for around 35 percent of a home run. Buchholz has struggled with injuries this season. When he is on the field, his fastball velocity has sat at a career low. Consequently, he\u2019s managed just 4.46 K/9 and 2.34 BB/9. That\u2019s a lot of balls in play. In Martinez\u2019s case, that\u2019s a lot of hard-hit balls in play. Once the Red Sox dispatch Buchholz, they\u2019ll bite into a juicy Blue Jays bullpen.\n\nAlso Consider: Nick Solak, Corey Seager, Austin Riley, Trey Mancini\n\nHIGH PRICED VALUES\n\nTommy Pham \u2013 OF \u2013 Tampa Bay Rays (at Kolby Allard)\n\nWhile Cody Bellinger is a slightly better value tonight, he\u2019s a very obvious pick. Meanwhile, I didn\u2019t want to leave this Rays-Rangers game unnoticed. The Rays love playing matchups \u2013 not just lefty/righty but any platoon advantage they can find. Allard is a left-handed ground ball pitcher. Typically, the Rays a touch lame versus southpaws, but they have sufficient September reinforcements to overcome their earlier weaknesses. More importantly, Pham destroys lefties. He\u2019s hitting .333/.467/.483 with more walks than strikeouts. Like Allard, Pham is a ground ball guy so this isn\u2019t a perfect matchup.\n\nAlso Consider: Justin Verlander, Cody Bellinger, Ronald Acuna, Yordan Alvarez, Mookie Betts", "description": "Brad Johnson reviews his favorite MLB DFS bargain targets for Thursday, September 12.
