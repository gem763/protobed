And let\u2019s just say, crazy town is at full capacity with this crew and the policies they support.\n\nYou name the problem\u2014genuine or overblown\u2014and they have a big government program or initiative that will fix it. At least, that\u2019s what they claim. The candidates had many opportunities to highlight them during the three-hour primetime spectacle.\n\nFirst up on the docket was healthcare\u2014a topic that continues to be a focus of policy discussions in the primary, and rightly so. Healthcare in the U.S. is not perfect and rising costs continue to pose a threat to the health and safety of many Americans. However, there\u2019s no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater; our doctors and hospitals currently offer the best healthcare in the world.\n\nIf only all candidates took that nuanced viewpoint to heart.\n\nFor the most part, 2020 Democratic candidates support socialized medicine; more specifically Medicare for All or a flavor of it. In short, the program would eliminate private health insurance for roughly 200 million Americans and replace it with government bureaucracy. Not only will it remove competition and choice\u2014which drives the industry to continuously improve\u2014but it will cost a fortune. One estimate pegs the cost of the program at $33 trillion for the first 10 years.\n\nAs seen in the U.K. and Canada, federalized healthcare has major consequences. For example, more than 60,000 Canadian patients flee the country each year to avoid extreme wait times for health services. And nearly one-million Canadians are stuck on healthcare wait lists, while the queue in the U.K. has ballooned to 4.1 million\u2014many of whom often wait 18 weeks for treatment. When applied to the U.S. population, that would translate to 10 million and 20 million Americans on a healthcare wait list respectively.\n\nSimply put, government-run healthcare will not be free and it will not provide the care Americans have come to expect.\n\nAnother focus was the \u201cclimate crisis.\u201d The candidates broadly agree that climate change is a major threat\u2014with some predicting the world will be reduced to a plume of ash in the near future if drastic action is not taken (I jest).\n\nJoking aside, taking better care of our environment is something all Americans should strive for. However, it should be approached reasonably so unintended consequences don\u2019t become worse than the issue that is being addressed. This is where many of the candidates begin to struggle.\n\nCase in point is presidential hopeful Senator Bernie Sanders. While all the candidates propose extreme regulation to curb climate change, Sanders\u2019 version of the Green New Deal is in another zip code. Not only does his plan call for all current forms of energy production to be replaced with clean alternatives by 2030, it federalizes the industry altogether.\n\nJust what we need. The financial insolvency and frustrating customer service that plagues the DMV and Post Office spread to the businesses that heat our homes and power our factories. What could go wrong? At least it comes at the bargain basement price of $16.3 trillion.\n\nBesides the government takeover of healthcare and energy production, the candidates offered an assortment of other costly and fundamentally-flawed ideas. Businessman Andrew Yang pushed for all Americans to receive a no-strings-attached allowance from the government. And Senator Elizabeth Warren wants to forgive trillions of dollars in student loan debt and offer free college to future students. The list goes on and on.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to sit on the couch and watch these candidates tout far-fetched initiatives that will bankrupt the country and its taxpayers. But I guess that\u2019s what\u2019s expected when these presidential hopefuls and their policies are stuck in crazy town.", "description": "On Thursday, 10 Democratic candidates took the stage for the .09/13/2019 21:35:33PM EST.", "authors": ["Elaine Parker", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/587e93a3-a028-400f-bbc0-d33887cfe1ad.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
