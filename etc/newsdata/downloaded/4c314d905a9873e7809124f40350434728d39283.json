I only need to know those two pieces of information.\u201d\n\nAbagnale, a former con artist famously portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the film Catch Me If You Can, is out with a new book aptly entitled \u201cScam Me If You Can: Simple Strategies to Outsmart Today\u2019s Rip-off Artists.\u201d In it, he highlights the tricks that today\u2019s scammers and con artists are using to commit fraud.\n\nIn the book, Abagnale outlines five rules of how to protect yourself from today\u2019s scammers:\n\nProtect your identity Tip: Put your guard up as soon as someone says you need to share your personal or financial information with them right now \u2014 stop and verify the person you\u2019re dealing with. Secure your finances Tip: Do not trust someone who tells you they always beat the market or can guarantee a certain level of returns. An honest and qualified financial planner cannot guarantee investment results. Preserve your digital presence Tip: Do not keep all your personal information in the cloud or on one laptop. Keep printouts of important documents in a lockbox or upload files to an external hard drive. Safeguard your home and hearth Tip: If you do not recognize the number calling you, do not pick it up. If you do pick up the call be sure to remain tight lipped as the con caller may be recording the call, and saying nothing usually results in the caller hanging up. Shelter your heart Tip: Verify that the person you are speaking with on a dating app is real. Search online to confirm claims of location, employment, and photos.\n\nOne surprising thing Abagnale notes in his book is the uselessness of passwords. He says that passwords were originally created to help secure individual time spent on computers used by multiple people, not to protect personal information or high security needs.\n\n\u201cPasswords are for treehouses ... If you look at ransomware breaches, malware, [breaches] all come from passwords. So I\u2019ve been a big advocator of eliminating passwords\u201d Abagnale said. \u201cI think you\u2019re starting to see more and more companies, retailers, merchants, eliminating the need for passwords. So in the next two or three years, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be using passwords\u201d.\n\nAbagnale said scamming and fraud are \u201c4,000 times easier than when I did it 50 years ago because I didn\u2019t have all the technology that exists today, the forms of communication that exist today.\u201d\n\nReserve your ticket!
