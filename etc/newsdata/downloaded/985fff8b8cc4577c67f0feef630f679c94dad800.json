Incidents like this have a big impact on small independent businesses like ours.\"\n\nThe woman had a photograph of her hair taken before it was treated, which Salon 23 has shared in the hope that she will come forward or somebody will recognise her.\n\nMr Clarke has reported the incident to the police.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThe salon shared the incident on Facebook , \"in the hope that she may read this and decide to contact us to explain her actions\".\n\nMr Clarke added that she understands if the woman had an emergency.\n\nHe added: \"Maybe there was an emergency or some other reason for her leaving and if so we are sure we will understand.\n\n\"If not then we would like to warn any of the other lovely salons in Plymouth to watch out for this lady whose mobile number ends in '291'.\n\n\"We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our fantastic regular clients who would never dream of doing anything like this and for your continued support and custom over the past few years.\"\n\nIf you have any information, please contact the salon on 01752 551419.", "description": "A Plymouth hairdressing salon had to report a client to police after she skipped out during her hair appointment", "authors": ["Katie Timms", "Image", "No Hair", "Beauty Studio", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20649355.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_No-23-Hair-and-Beauty-Studio.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
