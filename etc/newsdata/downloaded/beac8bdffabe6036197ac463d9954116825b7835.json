There are always stories, details, quotes and, if you\u2019re really desperate, hardcore statistical oddities that bring a historical match to life.\n\nThere are plenty who would argue that our output over the past 15 years is ample evidence against that theory, but we\u2019re going to test it again. There\u2019s nothing much going on in the cricket world this week, so we\u2019ve decided to celebrate the uncelebratable. Yep, it\u2019s the 30th anniversary of the Nehru Cup.\n\nHundred gets the ball rolling with sparkly draft for new-born franchises | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nThe MRF World Series for Jawaharlal Nehru, to give it its full name, was a mini-World Cup, and a forerunner to the Champions Trophy, that involved six of the seven Test-playing nations. (New Zealand, it seems, were not invited.) The tournament was ostensibly a celebration of the centenary of the birth of Nehru, the first Indian prime minister and an independence activist. In reality, it was designed to help the election campaign of Rajiv Gandhi, Nehru\u2019s grandson \u2013 it didn\u2019t work).\n\nThe tournament also satisfied India\u2019s burgeoning obsession with one-day internationals. Most of the other boards accepted invitations because of the money, which meant the players were obliged to shut up and get on with the kind of schedule that would be a health and safety scandal these days. The tournament even started without the hosts, who were still playing in the Champions Trophy in Sharjah. Pakistan played 11 ODIs in 19 days in both competitions. West Indies played 11 in 20; one of their team said the squad was suffering from \u201ccricket-lag\u201d.\n\nThe British media was especially critical of the brazen commercialism. \u201cI feel sorry for everyone out there,\u201d wrote Matthew Engel. \u201cIf anyone, one year from now, has the slightest recollection of it I shall be astonished.\u201d\n\nAhem. Well, now. Sorry Matthew, but when you are 14 years old and sport is your entire world, you tend to retain the kind of information that serves no useful purpose until you get the opportunity to write about it three decades later.\n\nThe Nehru Cup was a Teletext-only experience for the Spin, although at that age the imagination can fill in plenty of gaps \u2013 especially when you squint at a 15in screen and it says \u201cW Larkins c Border b May 124\u201d and you wait for the page to come around again and it still says \u201cW Larkins c Border b May 124\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Micky Stewart, the England coach, said: \u2018One-day cricket is so full of surprises that nothing surprises me any more.\u2019 Photograph: David Munden/Popperfoto/Getty Images\n\nThe lack of detail didn\u2019t matter. We had to wait only three weeks after the tournament had finished for the new issue of Wisden Cricket Monthly to provide chapter and verse on every game.\n\nIt was, quietly, a landmark tournament for English cricket \u2013 the beginning of the bleep-test years. With David Gower and Ian Botham omitted, the new captain, Graham Gooch, and the coach, Micky Stewart, picked a largely young team \u2013 including two future legends in the uncapped Alec Stewart and Nasser Hussain \u2013 and placed an emphasis on fitness that would eventually become the norm. Some of their ideas, including an endless series of shuttle runs, were not entirely commensurate with the cardiovascular modalities of experienced players such as Wayne Larkins and Allan Lamb.\n\nBuy a classic sport photograph: Freddie's humble handshake Read more\n\nEngland did pretty well in the Nehru Cup, reaching the semi-finals and beating Australia \u2013 who had slaughtered them 4-0 in the Ashes a few months earlier \u2013 in the round-robin stage. That game, which was the first England match to involve a team huddle, featured two innings worth remembering. Allan Border\u2019s 84 not out off 44 balls, an almost unprecedented rate of scoring back then, demonstrated the savage range-hitting that became the norm in the 21st century.\n\nEngland\u2019s opening pair were Gooch and Larkins, combined age 71. Larkins had been recalled after eight years because of Gooch\u2019s faith in his natural talent. The night before the game, as a few of the team chatted in the bar (that part hadn\u2019t yet changed), Larkins tried to lift morale by disparaging Terry Alderman, who had tormented England and Gooch in particular during the Ashes. \u201cGoochie, this Alderman is crap,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can\u2019t bowl. He\u2019ll have to disappear tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, Larkins woke with a fuzzy head and a nagging feeling that he had talked a dangerously cocksure talk. But he walked it too, manhandling Alderman and everyone else in the course of a devastating 124. After the game, as he was hailed by his teammates, Larkins lifted his head, smiled mischievously and said: \u201cTerry who?\u201d\n\nIt was the innings of Larkins\u2019s life, the only time in international cricket that he demonstrated his rare attacking ability. Try telling him the Nehru Cup meant nothing.\n\nOr Chetan Sharma. He slogged India to victory over England in the round-robin stage with an extraordinary 101 not out. Sharma was a seam bowler and lower-order slogger \u2013 his next highest ODI score was 38 \u2013 who was promoted up the order, just for one day.\n\nIn the Guardian, Mike Selvey said it was \u201cindisputably the worst century anyone who was watching could remember\u201d. Micky Stewart said: \u201cOne-day cricket is so full of surprises that nothing surprises me anymore.\u201d\n\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n\nThere were plenty of surprises in India, especially as most of the squad had never been there before. Derek Pringle\u2019s charming book Pushing the Boundaries, which the Spin unequivocally recommends, is full of lovely details and stories about that trip, including a meeting with a man who was in the Guinness Book of Records for having the world\u2019s longest fingernails.\n\nOur favourite is probably the health warning on a bottle of 8.5% beer: \u2018Drinking alcoholic beverages can be injurious to your health.\u2019\n\nEngland went out to Pakistan in a rain-affected semi-final that became a Thirty30 game. By coincidence, the noses of the press-box purists were elevated at precisely 30 degrees when they found out a rain-reduced game would decide a semi-final.\n\nPakistan beat West Indies in a thrilling final, when Wasim Akram hit his first delivery for six to seal victory with one ball to spare. The Pakistan captain, Imran Khan, reckoned the Nehru Cup victory was Pakistan\u2019s equivalent of Brian Clough\u2019s Anglo-Scottish Cup , and ultimately empowered them to win the World Cup in such thrilling style in 1992. If that\u2019s the case, the Nehru Cup more than justified its existence.\n\n\u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.
