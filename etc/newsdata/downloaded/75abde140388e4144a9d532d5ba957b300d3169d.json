We will be hit the hardest for the longest by a disastrous no-deal Brexit that no one voted for. We are ready for the fight.\u201d\n\nMr Lammy said: \u201cThis summer is our opportunity for our democracy to stir before decisions are made in parliament. And I\u2019ll be there in London on 12 October for the big one \u2013 the march of our lives \u2013 when we will say with one voice: Let Us Be Heard.\u201d\n\nMore than 100,000 demonstrators joined the first People\u2019s Vote march in June 2018, some 700,000 took part in the March for the Future in October 2018 and more than million took to the streets for the Put It To The People rally in March this year, according to organisers\u2019 estimates.\n\nSign up for the October march or the summer rallies across Britain here.\n\nTo help fundraising for this ambitious programme of events, donate here.", "description": "Supporters of a Final Say referendum are expected to throng the streets of London for a fourth time in what is set to be one of the biggest demonstrations Britain has ever seen \u2013 just weeks before the scheduled date of Brexit.
