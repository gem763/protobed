Shawn Menard\n\nThey recommend council allow the general manager of facilities, Dan Chenier, to hold public consultations and start negotiating with OSEG. One goal would be to eliminate operational expenses to free up money to repair the Aberdeen Pavilion.\n\nOSEG said it would not comment until Nov. 5, when its proposal goes before the finance and economic development committee.\n\nMenard fears commercialization\n\nThe councillor for the area, Shawn Menard, is wary.\n\n\"Lansdowne is a tremendous public asset, and yet the city seems eager to turn it all over to a private entity, whose primary objective is to make profit, with little public oversight or scrutiny,\" Menard said in a statement.\n\nNo business plan has been presented, Menard wrote, and no consultation has taken place. If council were to transfer operations to OSEG, it would be a \"a commercialization of the remaining public space at Lansdowne,\" he added.\n\nMenard doesn't even think there's been an issue coordinating events between the two parts of Lansdowne.\n\nFrom from January 2018 to March 2019, Lansdowne held 98 free events \u2014 including movie nights and a pumpkin derby \u2014 which drew 28,000 people. The city also made $425,000 by renting space for private events.\n\nOttawa Sports and Entertainment Group has proposed taking over programming and booking events in the parts of Lansdowne currently overseen by parks and recreation staff. That includes the Great Lawn, seen here. (Kate Porter/CBC)\n\nLansdowne reboot\n\nLast spring, OSEG officials promised city hall they would come up with ideas for making Lansdowne a draw beyond Ottawa Redblacks or Ottawa 67's game days.\n\nFor instance, Lansdowne will host a European-style Christmas market at the outdoor plaza this holiday season, and the plaza will get a new stage for performances and big-screen gatherings.\n\nOSEG had raised expensive ideas like rebuilding the north-side stands at TD Place or talking with the National Capital Commission about opening up Lansdowne to better face the Rideau Canal, but any major capital projects appear to be a discussion for a later date.\n\nAberdeen Square at Lansdowne in Ottawa was renamed the Casino Lac-Leamy Plaza at Lansdowne in fall 2019. Out of the agreement, some $250,000 will be spent to create covered a performance area and more shaded seating. (Kate Porter/CBC)\n\n15-month net loss\n\nThe staff report also gives a snapshot of the financial status of the Lansdowne partnership. It posted net loss of $12.7 million from January 2018 to March 2019.\n\nIt's difficult to compare those results to the $7.9 million net loss of 2017 \u2014 the year TD Place hosted the Grey Cup \u2014 because the latest figures reflect a change in OSEG's fiscal calendar.\n\nStaff suggest revenues from its partnership with OSEG have grown by $2 million year over year, when the Grey Cup boost is set aside. The retail area is 98 per cent leased.\n\nThe community associations for the Glebe, Old Ottawa South and Old Ottawa East are holding a public meeting at the Horticulture Building on Oct. 28 at 7 p.m. in order to discuss OSEG's proposal.", "description": "Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group has made a pitch to expand its role\u00a0at Lansdowne Park and take over the city-run side of the park, but\u00a0the local councillor questions if the public is well-served by the city handing over control.", "authors": ["Kate Porter Covers Municipal Affairs For Cbc Ottawa.
