Dovizioso is second and fellow Italian Danilo Petrucci is another 31 points back in third. But the team's only victory in Aragon was back in 2010, the year the circuit made its MotoGP debut.\n\nDovizioso's challenge has faded over the last two races. The Italian was unlucky at Silverstone, where he collided with Quartararo on the first lap. Then he was only sixth at Misano.\n\n\"Motorland is one of the most unusual tracks in the calendar,\" he said. \"In the past I had never really scored any good results, but last year we were very competitive and we finished second, so we arrive at the race weekend with this memory and this mentality.\"\n\nFinnish veteran Mika Kallio will step in for Johann Zarco at KTM after the team abruptly ended their relationship with the French rider.\n\nZarco joined the Austrian team before this season but had struggled to adapt.\n\n\"I don't want to say (if I am disappointed with the decision). It's part of the game,\" said Zarco, who had requested his contract be terminated at the end of season.\n\n\"Now I am free to find opportunities and I still believe I can do great things in MotoGP. I have a dream that I want to achieve and I will manage to have all the tools in my hand to catch this dream.\"\n\nThe main race will begin at 13:00 local time (1100 GMT) on Sunday, after the Moto3 race but before the Moto2 race.\n\njld/smr/pb\n\nVOLKSWAGEN\n\nYAMAHA MOTOR\n\nSUZUKI MOTOR", "description": "Marc Marquez will be at home in every sense this weekend in Aragon as he seeks to close in on a sixth MotoGP world title.
