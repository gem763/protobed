The Monica Lewinsky story had broken that morning, and, as a reporter on the national staff of The Post, I was asked to write an analysis of the potential legal risks to President Bill Clinton. My editors were reluctant to have a reference to impeachment in the lead of the article. They thought it sounded far-fetched.\n\nAs a result, the article began like this: \u201cThe allegations facing President Clinton \u2014 that he lied under oath about having a sexual relationship with a White House aide and told her to deny it \u2014 represent serious possible criminal violations that, if supported, could lead to his removal from office and prosecution.\u201d\n\nHere we go again. Actually: Here we must go again.\n\nI was never among those who considered the Clinton impeachment a frivolous exercise. Lying under oath \u2014 even lying about private sexual behavior \u2014 is a serious abuse, even more so when done by the sitting president. So is attempting to obstruct justice. The Senate was correct in stopping short of removing the president from office in 1999, but Clinton\u2019s conduct debased his office to the extent that an impeachment inquiry and a vote to impeach were warranted.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s behavior is of a different, and more alarming, magnitude.\n\nThe previous facts of Trump\u2019s misconduct \u2014 his multiple efforts to obstruct justice in the probe by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III \u2014 were enough to justify an impeachment inquiry but not to require one. The revelation that the president sought help from a foreign government to discredit a leading political opponent is such a misuse of the powers of his office that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) would have been remiss in her own constitutional duties not to have responded.\n\nThere is no need to demonstrate a quid pro quo \u2014 although there appears nearly indisputable proof of one in the form of Trump dangling a presidential meeting in return for Ukraine\u2019s willingness to investigate his political opponent. There is no need to prove additional such invitations for foreign meddling \u2014 although the president\u2019s comments about China constitute evidence of his flagrant willingness to abuse his power. There is no need to pile on additional counts of impeachable behavior\u2014 although the administration\u2019s high-handed move Tuesday to block the testimony of Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland is, as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), put it, among \u201cfurther acts of obstruction of a coequal branch of government.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have adopted various rationalizations to cope with this unpleasant reality. Some \u2014 including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri \u2014 have joined the he-was-just-joking caucus to deal with Trump\u2019s invitation to Chinese meddling, an approach that fails to deal with the Ukraine conduct and the likelihood of more incriminating evidence to come.\n\nOthers \u2014 most prominently Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio \u2014 have taken what might be called the yeast approach: The president\u2019s conduct was \u201cnot appropriate,\u201d he admits, but it does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense. That has the benefit of at least acknowledging the gravity of the moment, but it begs the question: If this conduct is not impeachable, what is?\n\nFifteen current Republican senators served in the House or Senate during the Clinton impeachment. All but one of those \u2014 Sen. Susan Collins of Maine \u2014 voted either to impeach Clinton or to convict him and remove him from office. I\u2019d challenge any of them to explain why they deemed Clinton\u2019s behavior so bad and are so unmoved by Trump\u2019s.\n\nOne instrument of Republican efforts to distract from this difficult question involves Hunter Biden, the son of the former vice president and, more to the point, current Democratic presidential candidate. It is possible to believe both that Hunter Biden\u2019s up-to-$50,000-a-month deal with Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma traded inappropriately on family connections and to understand that the pressure campaign mounted on Ukraine by Trump and his minions to investigate the Bidens was an impeachable offense.\n\nAnother is the assertion, peddled Monday night on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Beat With Ari Melber\u201d by Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow, that the president\u2019s conduct did not violate any \u201crule, law or statute\u201d and therefore does not constitute an impeachable offense. This is doubly wrong. First, it is clear that conduct can be a \u201chigh crime or misdemeanor\u201d without meeting the precise elements of a criminal offense. Second, even if not necessary, it would be entirely possible to fit Trump\u2019s conduct within the framework of criminal law \u2014 for example, soliciting something of value to his campaign from a foreign government.\n\nOther diversions are now underway: Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson\u2019s Deep State sputtering over Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, as if the former FBI officials had anything to do with Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine; faux legalistic hand-wringing over relying on hearsay and confronting accusers, as if such protections were relevant at the evidence-gathering stage. Meanwhile, the White House has weighed in with a belligerent eight-page letter refusing to cooperate with what it claims is a \u201cconstitutionally invalid\u201d impeachment inquiry.\n\nPolling suggests the American people are not distracted by this noise and grasp the gravity of Trump\u2019s conduct. Perhaps their leaders will read and follow.\n\nruthmarcus@washpost.com\n\nRead more from Ruth Marcus\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.", "description": "If this conduct is not impeachable, what is?", "authors": ["Ruth Marcus", "Overseeing Washington Post Signed Opinion Content", "Writing On Domestic Politics", "Deputy Editorial Page Editor", "October At Pm", "Ruth Marcus Is Deputy Editorial Page Editor For The Post.
