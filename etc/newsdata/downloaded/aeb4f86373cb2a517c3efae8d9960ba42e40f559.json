The Commission for Countering Extremism looked at examples of protests to measure the effect of such behaviour. Tommy Robinson - Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, used protest marches to spread an anti-minority, anti-Muslim agenda In 2016 tensions erupted in Sunderland when a woman claimed she had been gang raped by a group of Middle Eastern men. When no suspects were prosecuted, 'prominent far right figures' took up the woman's cause, organising 13 marches in 13 months which at their height drew 1,000 participants. The report defended the right to protest peacefully but added: 'A democratic process like protesting can turn into hateful extremism when protesters deliberately distort the truth to persuade their audience to adopt discriminatory and hateful attitudes.' It said: 'Prominent far-right figures including Anne Marie Waters, Jayda Fransen and Stephen Yaxley-Lennon [Tommy Robinson's real name] attended marches, and some used them to spread anti-minority and anti-Muslim agendas.' When speaking to people in Birmingham, the commission was told 'the threat of Islamist agitation in the area was constant and had recently intensified' in the wake of protests outside primary schools over teaching programmes on LGBT+ relationships. The report said: 'The Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir published an article that describes the protests as just one front in a battle between Muslims resisting the 'neutralising' effects of a liberal order that 'hollows' religions by cutting out what it deems intolerable and forcing conformity to liberal ideals. 'The commission has seen a PowerPoint presentation prepared by Hizb ut-Tahrir. 'The deeply hate-filled presentation compares LGBT+ people to animals, paedophiles and zoophiles. It also implies that there should be a prohibition against LGBT+ similar to that against incest.'\n\nThe report found that far-right figures like Tommy Robinson were using rallies to spread an 'anti-Muslim agenda' and 'deliberately distort the truth' to incite 'discriminatory and hateful attitudes' among supporters.\n\nThe review - based on 3,000 responses to the inquiry, survey data and visits to 20 towns and cities - found that activists working to tackle extremists are being abused rather than supported.\n\nThey have been the subject of racist and sexist abuse, with some facing 'unacceptable vilification in an attempt to smear and silence counter-extremists', the report said.\n\nWords such as 'Islamophobic', a 'sell-out' and 'an Uncle Tom' have been used, with some telling researchers they have been shunned by family and friends, had events shut down due to safety concerns, been forced to move house, and even received death and rape threats.\n\nThe report states: 'We are also concerned by the hateful manner with which some Islamists abuse and intimidate Muslims who work to counter Islamist extremism.\n\n'This can involve characterising them as bad Muslims \u2013 or even apostates \u2013 for \u2018selling out\u2019 their perceived group loyalty.\n\n'Secular Bangladeshi bloggers have described it as \u201cdeeply upsetting\u201d when they are accused of being anti-Islam for opposing the influence of Islamist groups in their local area.\n\n'We found that the advocacy group CAGE has described Muslim activists with whom it disagrees as \u2018native informants\u2019 and \u2018Uncle Toms\u2019, terms which we judge to be racist and hateful.\n\n'Staff from another organisation, MEND, have posted hostile messages on Twitter relating to several politically and socially liberal Muslims, especially those involved in counter extremism work.\n\n'One MEND tweet labels some Muslims groups as \u201cUncle Toms\u201d and the public messaging of MEND\u2019s founder describes civil society groups involved in counter extremism as \u201cgovernment stooges\u201d'\n\nThe report also identified another category of extremist behaviour, named by the commission as hateful extremism, which is different from terrorism and violent extremism.\n\nIt defined hateful extremism as behaviour which can 'incite and amplify hate' or make the 'moral case for violence' and could put people at risk of harm.\n\nSuch behaviour may direct 'hateful, hostile or supremacist beliefs' to groups perceived to be a threat to 'well-being, survival or success'.\n\nThe report said: 'Behaviours that lie outside democratic debate fall into three categories: terrorism and violent extremism, hateful extremism and the restriction of rights and freedoms.\n\n'It is our view that countering hateful extremism requires the greatest attention and focus if we are to be successful in reducing the extremist threat.'\n\nThe report found people have a 'deep concern' about extremism, with 76 per cent of those who responded to a consultation saying more needs to be done to tackle it and nearly 50 per cent saying they have witnessed some form of this behaviour.\n\nIt concluded there needs to be a clearer distinction between work to tackle violent extremism and terrorism, and that which challenges hateful extremism. But rights to be 'radical, protest and be offensive' should be protected.\n\nIt also concluded that efforts to combat extremism are failing partially because people struggle to tell the different between open democratic debate and ideas that promote violence and hatred.\n\nSara Khan (pictured) said the Government 'must urgently overhaul its approach to challenging extremism, starting with a new definition of hateful extremism'\n\nThe report said: 'Our evidence shows that large numbers of people are either affected by extremism or are worried about its effects on wider society.\n\n'Yet some of the examples we were given include behaviours that we judge to be dissenting or offensive and are legitimate. These are part of democratic debate and must be protected.\n\nMs Khan said: 'The Government must urgently overhaul its approach to challenging extremism, starting with a new definition of hateful extremism, a new Government strategy and a Home Secretary-led task force.\n\n'Our country's response to terrorism is robust.\n\n'This is not the case for hateful extremism. Yet if we are to be successful in reducing the extremist threat in our society, we need to focus our efforts on challenging hateful extremism.\n\n'We are not doing enough to protect victims. We under-estimate the impact of those that make the moral case for violence.\n\n'We can, and must, do more to address the spread of hateful extremism on our streets and online.\n\n'We must not allow extremists to normalise their hatred.'\n\nBaroness Williams, the minister for countering extremism, said the Home Office would consider the findings and respond in due course, adding: 'It sickens me that extremists attempt to spread their toxic views, which go completely against our fundamental values.\n\n'Our new counter-extremism strategy, due to be published next year, will reflect the changing nature we face from extremism whilst building on the positive work already delivered.'", "description": "Sara Khan (pictured), who leads the UK's Commission for Countering Extremism which published the report, said people working to tackle extremism need more support.", "authors": ["Joel Adams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/17/19404222-0-image-a-17_1570464849567.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
