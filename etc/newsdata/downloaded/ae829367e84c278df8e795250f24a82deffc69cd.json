To be thrown in during that game, he was outstanding from minute one.\n\n\u201cBut now, he\u2019s getting to a point where he\u2019s one of the best full-backs I\u2019ve ever seen going forward \u2013 his passing is unbelievable.\u201d\n\nWhile Alexander-Arnold\u2019s offensive play marks him out as one of the finest around, there remain aspects to his game which can yet be improved \u2013 as should be expected from a youngster, who is one game shy of reaching 100 senior club appearances.\n\nNeville pointed out where the No. 66 needs to continue working hard, with his potential ceiling being incredibly high.\n\n\u201cThe three Tottenham chances today, the [Heung-min] Son one where he hits the bar he should\u2019ve been nearer, the goal he should\u2019ve stopped him coming inside, and the [Danny] Rose one at the end, he got caught and dived in.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to become as serious about his defending as he is about his attacking, and you\u2019ve got a world-class full-back there.\n\n\u201cToday, Tottenham could have scored two or three and he could\u2019ve been sat on a losing team or a team that drew because of his defensive play. If he looks at that, it\u2019s an epitome of what his game is.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to the excellent Robertson and Alexander-Arnold, fellow pundit Roy Keane was scathing in his comments about Rose and Serge Aurier, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t compare them to Liverpool, the two lads who are absolutely fantastic.\u201d\n\nFormer Liverpool midfielder Graeme Souness pointed out that Liverpool\u2019s enviable record over the last few years might have actually contributed to Alexander-Arnold not really getting the chance to improve himself defensively with enough regularity yet.\n\n\u201cTrent\u2019s five years younger than Andy Robertson, he\u2019s not the finished article when it comes to defending, but has he learned in the last couple of years that part of his game?\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because he spends so much time on the front foot. They\u2019ve got such good players around him, that he\u2019s not asked to do much at the other end, but it will cost them at times.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a part of the game you can learn, the easiest part. What\u2019s he\u2019s got in abundance is athleticism, and he\u2019s got a wand of a right foot. He can whip the balls in when he gets into the attacking half. He\u2019s a very special player, who will only get better.\u201d\n\nAlexander-Arnold has thus far earned seven caps at international level for England and is battling Atletico Madrid\u2019s Keiran Trippier for a regular place in the team.", "description": "Liverpool\u00a0right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold put on an impressive showing in Sunday\u2019s 2-1 Premier League win over Tottenham\u00a0and was the recipient of huge praise\u00a0after the game by Gary Neville and his fellow pundits.
