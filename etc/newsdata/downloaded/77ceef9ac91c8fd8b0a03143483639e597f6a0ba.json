The main course has proven harder to stomach than anyone could have expected: a late spike in claims that could cost the bank up to \u00a31.8bn.\n\nComplaints had been running at just under 200,000 a week but that number quadrupled as the deadline agreed between the banks and the Financial Conduct Authority for submitted them approached.\n\nIf Lloyds\u2019 worst case scenario is realised, the total cost to the industry will come in at over \u00a350bn, of which it will have contributed just under \u00a322bn.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt is, of course, possible that the final cost of the pre deadline claims spike will come in towards the lower end of Lloyds\u2019 range, which the bank put at \u00a31.2bn.\n\nSome of the late rush may be the result of people just rolling the dice and submitting claims with little validity.\n\nWhen banks huff and puff about their customers doing that, it pays to remember that it wouldn\u2019t have happened if they hadn\u2019t ripped off millions of people in the first place.\n\nThat said, the thing to remember about PPI is banks\u2019 worst case scenarios have time and again proven to be wildly over optimistic.\n\nThe financial hit from this latest provision will have real world consequences for Lloyds\u2019 investors. While bank has sought to reassure that it will have sufficient capital to pay its dividend, its share buy back programme (another means of returning capital to investors) has been suspended.\n\nThat had been helping to prop up the share price of late.\n\nBig investors suffering fall out from this, even if it\u2019s limited, is a very welcome development.\n\nFew of them raised any questions when banks were aggressively selling millions of worthless PPI policies, despite the fact that the profit margins on them were so wildly out of whack when compared to other insurance policies that it ought to have raised alarm bells.\n\nInstitutional shareholders, with a time horizon longer than a few months, should have been asking how those sort of margins were produced and whether they were sustainable. If it looks to good to be true in banking, that's because it usually is.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
