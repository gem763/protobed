We're going to participate in a thoughtful way and I'm really comfortable with that.\"\n\nJapan is a golf-crazy country and there have been massive crowds flocking to Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club, some 80 kilometres (50 miles) outside Tokyo, for the new $9.25 million event to see the likes of Woods, McIlroy and home-grown hero Hideki Matsuyama.\n\nIt is whetting the appetite for next year's Olympics in Tokyo, said Monahan.\n\n\"I'm excited to come back here and see golf in Tokyo at an Olympic Games, I think it's going to be as passionate a following as any sport's going to have,\" said Monahan.\n\n\"There was so much positive energy around the 2016 Games.\n\n\"The players that competed loved it. We're not going to be playing opposite the week of the Olympics like we were in 2016,\" he added, underscoring the importance of the Games now in golf's global calendar.\n\nAnd he had good news for golf fans in Japan -- the US PGA Tour is here to stay, beyond the initial six-year deal for the Zozo Championship.\n\n\"When we make a commitment to bring a new event to a market, that's a commitment that is permanent,\" Monahan said\n\n\"Our intention is to never leave Japan, to always have a PGA Tour event in Japan from this day forward.\"", "description": "The US PGA Tour is ready to roll the dice and unveil gambling at tournaments \"from next year\" to tap into new audiences, Commissioner Jay Monahan has revealed to AFP.
