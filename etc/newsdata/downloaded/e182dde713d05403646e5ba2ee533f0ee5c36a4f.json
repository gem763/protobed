Fibre optic cables involve tiny tubes that are about as thick as a human hair and are reflective on the inside. They transfer information by sending flashes of light through the tubes. This bounces off the reflective walls and along the cable. These flashes of data are then received and interpreted at the other end.\n\nCity Hall says the additional funding brings its total investment in full fibre connectivity to more than \u00a330 million, which will help more than 400,000 homes across London.\n\n'We're delighted that we can help increase connectivity across the city by using the London Underground to help provide better broadband internet,' said Shashi Verma, chief technology officer at Transport for London.\n\n'This work is on top of our wider plans to remove one of London's biggest not-spots by bringing 4G to the Tube network, with the first section on track to go live from March 2020.'", "description": "The plan will start with 118,000 premises in south London and hopes to tackle so-called 'not spot' areas where connectivity is particularly poor, City Hall says.", "authors": ["Sophie Curtis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/12/20123126-0-image-a-5_1571915248146.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
