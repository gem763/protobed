Athletes Could Be Paid Under New California Law", "language": "en", "text": "If it survives any legal battles and takes effect, the California measure will apply to the state\u2019s biggest college sports programs, as well as many of its smaller ones. With limited exceptions, the schools and the N.C.A.A. will not be allowed to keep students from participating in sports if they have been paid for the use of their names, images or likenesses, whether in connection with lucrative shoe contracts or modest endorsements for local restaurants. Students will also be permitted to hire agents, a move now restricted.\n\n\u201cPeople are just so aware of the fact that you\u2019ve got a multibillion-dollar industry that \u2014 let\u2019s set aside scholarships \u2014 basically denies compensation to the very talent, the very work that produces that revenue,\u201d said Senator Nancy Skinner, a Democrat, who wrote the legislation. \u201cStudents who love their sport and are committed to continuing their sport in college are handicapped in so many ways, and it\u2019s all due to N.C.A.A. rules.\u201d\n\nSkinner introduced the legislation in February, and Newsom said he had not expected it to reach his desk. Still, sensing the severity of the legislative threat from California, as well as from a handful of other states and Congress, the N.C.A.A. announced in May that it had convened a committee to consider changes \u2014 a tactic that supporters of the existing model hoped would buy time and stave off legislative action.\n\nThe group\u2019s recommendations are expected in October, but California officials, skeptical that the N.C.A.A. would adopt substantive changes, chose to press ahead with their legislation.\n\n\u201cPeople said, \u2018You know what, we\u2019ve got to force their hands,\u2019\u201d said Newsom, who was once a regent for some of California\u2019s largest public universities. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to do the right thing on their own. They only do the right thing when they\u2019re sued or they\u2019re forced to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nAt least on this issue, the sentiment was bipartisan; the bill passed unanimously.\n\nLike Newsom, Senator Brian Jones, a Republican from San Diego County who supported the legislation, doubted that the leaders in college sports would pull together quick reforms.", "description": "Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill to allow college athletes to hire agents and make money from endorsements.
