It was a far cry from fourteen years earlier when the town was ravaged by Hurricane Katrina and a devastating sixteen-foot storm surge leveled buildings and boats alike. Yet for some, with Dorian spinning in the Atlantic Ocean, there was still a sense of unease.\n\nThe Bayou is littered with abandoned structures and small businesses interspersed along its curving roads. One of these low-slung structures is Captain Frank's Smoke Shack, a barbecue restaurant known for its award-winning gumbo. Run by Ann Morse and her husband, former shrimp boat captain Frank Morse, the building took a massive amount of water in Katrina.\n\n\"The water was up to here,\" the diminutive Morse indicated with her hand extended a foot above her head, approximately six feet in the air.\n\nIMG_4812.JPG More\n\nJames Cullen\n\nLike many in Alabama, Morse was apprehensive about Hurricane Dorian, a feeling which was only heightened by President Donald Trump, who continued to claim Alabama was in the path of the storm for several days \u2014 despite the National Weather Service adamantly denying his claims.\n\nAs Dorian moved up the coast towards the Carolinas on Thursday, President Trump was still focused on Alabama, tweeting, \"Just as I said, Alabama was originally projected to be hit. The Fake News denies it!\"\n\nLater Thursday afternoon, the president posted a series of screenshots from the National Weather Service showing a projection of Alabama in Dorian's path. The only problem? The projections themselves were already four days old \u2014 and they weren't exactly projections. Rather, the images were \"spaghetti plots,\" a type of projection that aggregates statistical, atmospheric, and historical models. They can be useful for developing forecasts but aren't actually forecasts themselves.\n\nScreen Shot 2019 09 06 at 9.57.59 AM More\n\nTwitter/@realdonaldtrump\n\nWhen that tweet failed to have the desired effect, Trump then had Homeland Security and Counterterrorism advisor Rear Admiral Peter J.
