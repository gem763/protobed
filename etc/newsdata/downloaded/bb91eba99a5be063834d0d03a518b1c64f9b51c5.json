About seven in 10 received hormone treatment and some 48% received surgical treatment. Surgical treatments fell into the categories of breast or dermatological chest surgery, reproductive-organ surgery, or dermatological surgery and laryngeal surgery to modify the voice.\n\nTransgender individuals were six times as likely as their general-population counterparts to have visited a health-care provider for an anxiety or mood disorder, more than six times as likely to have had a post-suicide attempt hospitalization, and three to four times as likely to have been prescribed antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, found the study, which was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nThe researchers linked gender-affirming treatments with a decline in transgender people\u2019s use of mental-health services, with their odds of receiving mental-health treatment decreasing by 8% for each year after their surgery over the following decade.\n\nThis association \u201clends support to the decision to provide gender-affirming surgeries to transgender individuals who seek them,\u201d the authors wrote. A significant link didn\u2019t emerge with respect to the hormone treatments.\n\nEven a decade after these individuals received gender-affirming treatments, \u201cthe prevalence of mental-health treatment utilization continued to exceed that of the general Swedish population, suggesting the need to address factors in addition to gender-affirming treatment availability that may strengthen transgender individuals\u2019 mental health,\u201d the authors said.\n\nThese factors might include reducing other stressors including victimization and economic inequality among transgender people, they wrote, as well as the need for them to conceal their identity to avoid stigma. \u201cEnsuring access to transgender-affirming mental health care may also further reduce transgender individuals\u2019 persistent psychiatric risk,\u201d they added.\n\nThe number of gender-affirming surgeries rose substantially between 2000 and 2014, according to a 2018 JAMA Surgery study, an uptick that researchers suggested could be linked to expansion of insurance coverage for such operations.\n\nBut as the authors of the present study point out, some states bar the use of state funds in covering gender-affirming treatment costs, and the Department of Veterans Affairs doesn\u2019t include gender-affirming surgery in its health-care coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, large employers have made strides toward inclusion in recent years: 83% of companies scored in the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s 2019 Corporate Equality Index covered at least one transgender-inclusive health-care policy, while 73% said they had removed broad exclusions of transgender-inclusive health care from company-offered plans.\n\nTransgender individuals are at greater risk for poor health and more likely than their cisgender counterparts to be uninsured, research has shown. What\u2019s more, one in four respondents to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey said they had insurance problems related to their gender identity in the previous year, and 55% who had sought coverage for surgery related to their transition reported being denied.\n\nA 2015 analysis published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine deemed insurance companies\u2019 coverage of transgender health-care expenses \u201caffordable and cost-effective\u201d with \u201ca low budget impact on U.S. society.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor this small investment for a small number of people, we could improve their lives significantly,\u201d lead study author William Padula said in a statement.", "description": "Transgender individuals in a new study were six times as likely as their general-population counterparts to have visited a health-care provider for an...", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS713_transg_ZG_20191004151503.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
