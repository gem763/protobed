And Mr. Epstein spoke with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and JPMorgan Chase about a proposed multibillion-dollar charitable fund \u2014 an arrangement that had the potential to generate enormous fees for Mr. Epstein.\n\n\u201cHis lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me,\u201d Mr. Gates emailed colleagues in 2011, after his first get-together with Mr. Epstein.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Business Jeffrey-Epstein-Bill-Gates.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
