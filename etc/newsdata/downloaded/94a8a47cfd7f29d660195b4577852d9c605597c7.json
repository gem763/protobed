The signs are it\u2019s not working | Owen Jones", "language": "en", "text": "Imagine the scene in parliament late last night: a scruffy man with a ruffled open shirt, swinging a plastic carrier bag, staggers up to the escalator near the Palace of Westminster, yelling wildly at the leader of the opposition: \u201cJeremy, let\u2019s have an election!\u201d Corbyn was on a phone call, but a bewildered phalanx of shadow ministers clocked who it was: \u201ccareer psychopath\u201d (in the words of David Cameron) Dominic Cummings, the UK\u2019s co-prime minister. \u201cI thought he was a drunk tourist,\u201d reports Cat Smith, one of the shadow ministers present last night.\n\nAn election is on the cards. So what do the polls tell us? | Gideon Skinner Read more\n\nA drunk tourist is an apt description for Cummings: intoxicated with his own overblown reputation and sense of destiny; a man with foul-mouthed contempt for a party he\u2019s simply passing through, subjecting it to a reign of terror in order to secure his precious Brexit project.\n\nWhether Cummings is a clever man, or just a man who wants us to think he is clever, remains unproven. What is clear is that Cummings and Boris Johnson are gearing up to run an election on a manifesto promising what the cultural theorist Stuart Hall once described as \u201cauthoritarian populism\u201d. Such populism, wrote Hall, \u201cunlike classic fascism, has retained most (though not all) of the formal representative institutions in place, and ... at the same time has been able to construct itself an active popular consent\u201d. This was Hall\u2019s description of Thatcherism, but it is a more apt description of a Johnson regime attempting to implement what the Tory hard Brexiteers always craved: to use the 2016 referendum result to craft a national-conservative revolution.\n\nAfter four years of press panic about the \u201cStalinist authoritarianism\u201d of Labour, not one of its MPs has been deselected. Yet after assuming the premiership just six weeks ago, Johnson has already shut down parliament, purged 21 of his opponents, and called into question whether he\u2019d obey the law.\n\nThe outrage at his assault on democratic norms will mean nothing to the political coalition Johnson seeks to craft in the coming election. The Brexiteers claim they want to turn Britain into a low-tax and low-regulation trading island like Singapore; but the direction Johnson and Cummings are heading in looks more like Hungary, a nation ruled by an authoritarian, anti-immigrant, antisemitic regime which the Tories have voted to defend. The trappings of democracy are maintained, but the substance is hollowed out: what its prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, lauds as an \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d. Opponents are vilified as enemies of the people and George Soros is cast as a rootless Jewish financier wielding disproportionate and sinister power. Media opponents have been stifled.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Dominic Cummings has a foul-mouthed contempt for a party he\u2019s simply passing through, subjecting it to a reign of terror in order to secure his precious Brexit project.\u2019 Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nThe Tories won\u2019t borrow the antisemitism, but a government whose leader described Muslim women as \u201cbank robbers\u201d and \u201cletterboxes\u201d will likely fuel bigotry. Migrant-bashing will be combined with law-and-order authoritarianism and targeted spending hikes on austerity-ravaged education and healthcare. Just as the Tories in the 1980s incited bigotry against gay people for political gain, it\u2019s now reported in the Times that No 10 has \u201cbeen polling \u2018culture war issues\u2019, such as transgender rights, to see whether they can be weaponised against Labour in northern working-class constituencies\u201d.\n\nTax cuts will be offered across the board, but weighted towards older, affluent, high-turnout voters. For the third of the population for whom Brexit overrides all else, there will be a do-or-die commitment to prise an exit from the grip of a nefarious, disloyal political elite; for others, Brexit weariness and tedium will be exploited. Johnson won\u2019t need to muzzle the press, of course: most will show slavish loyalty.\n\nThe onslaught against Johnson\u2019s opponents will have grim consequences. An increasingly thuggish far right see him as their own: extremists have called a demo this weekend to \u201cget behind our Queen & Boris\u201d. Their support for his government has largely escaped scrutiny. Johnson may disavow their enthusiastic approval, but as was said of a Trumpian candidate in Florida last year: \u201cThe racists believe he\u2019s a racist.\u201d\n\nYet hubris may collide with nemesis. Britain\u2019s dominant business class \u2013 the Tories\u2019 traditional key base and source of funding \u2013 are divided, with some fearing no deal more than Corbynism. Labour can easily outflank the Tories\u2019 spending plans, arguing that the Conservative fiscal U-turn is an acceptance that austerity has failed and that their opponents were right all along. Just as Labour should never compete with the Tories over being tough on immigration \u2013 voters will always believe the Tories more \u2013 the political debate is shifting to Corbyn\u2019s favoured ground. Tax cuts can be matched with tangible policy commitments, whether it be on childcare or scrapping tuition fees.\n\nThe polling shows that, while most remainers are repulsed by no deal, leave supporters are lukewarm and conflicted. There are early signs \u2013 in polling and on the streets \u2013 of remainers coming back to Labour. In an election, a binary choice in most constituencies between enabling a no-deal Johnson government, or a Labour administration offering a public vote with the option of remain \u2013 perhaps an immediate referendum with the other option of \u201crenegotiate\u201d \u2013 could cut through.\n\nBritain is mired in democratic crisis \u2013 but it goes much deeper than Brexit | Aditya Chakrabortty Read more\n\nJohnson\u2019s dire performances this week in the House of Commons, and his bumbling bluster when under pressure in the Tory leadership campaign, have challenged the myth of his charismatic, campaigning selling point. Corbyn, meanwhile, has regained his mojo as an election campaign \u2013 where he\u2019s in his element \u2013 approaches.\n\nThe Tory strategy may yet succeed: authoritarian populism fused with targeted spending hikes and Brexit fatigue may triumph. Labour cannot simply repeat their 2017 campaign \u2013 and Johnson\u2019s opponents may still divide. A bleak, intolerant Britain beckons if so. But I wonder, as he parades the Commons, drunk on self-confidence, if Cummings is starting to wonder if he\u2019s not quite as clever as he thinks.\n\n\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The Tories\u2019 key funders are divided, and the prime minister\u2019s performances have been dire, says Guardian columnist Owen Jones", "authors": ["Owen Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f382cb8e5594088598cc3ca396d05d3599a482c2/0_238_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a6d2589a5f4ad376cad33a3f47281197"}
