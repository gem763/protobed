(USAT)\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Trevor Lawrence threw two passes in the first quarter here Saturday that his coach described as \u201cjust, like, the worst football ever.\u201d They were forced passes into the Louisville end zone, delivered into the hands of Cardinals safeties who didn\u2019t have to do anything special to intercept them. They were shockingly bad reads and decisions from a guy who, last year, was as good as any college freshman has ever looked throwing the ball.\n\n\n\n\u201cI just kind of threw it straight to them,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\n\n\nAnd, ultimately, it didn\u2019t matter at all. Maybe those mistakes will matter a lot at some point in the season \u2014 after Christmas? \u2014 but for now Clemson\u2019s schedule offers a luxurious margin for error.\n\n\n\nClemson went on to pound Louisville, 45-10, putting together three authoritative quarters after the opening mayhem. It was victory No. 22 in a row for the defending national champions, with no end to the winning in sight. From here the Tigers will face zero currently ranked teams before a presumed ACC championship game against a cadaver from the Coastal Division.\n\n\n\nMaybe there is an Illinois or a South Carolina lying in the weeds waiting for the Tigers \u2014 like, maybe actually South Carolina, which hosts Clemson on Nov. 30 \u2014 but it seems unlikely. Without much resembling the juggernaut that Clemson was at the end of the 2018 season, the 2019 Tigers still have the easiest path to the playoff of any team in America.\n\n\n\nOnce there, they will have to tighten things up. Especially their star quarterback.\n\n\n\nDabo Swinney told Lawrence his two interceptions were \u201cstupid,\u201d then he told him to forget about it. Which Lawrence did, with considerable aplomb. His first-quarter pass efficiency rating was minus-3.49 (comically bad). His efficiency rating over the next three quarters was 207.80 (extremely good).\n\n\n\nLawrence made some throws that no other college quarterback can make, on his way to 17 completions in 22 attempts for 224 yards and three touchdowns. He ran the ball effectively (10 carries for 47 yards). He led Clemson to 42 points in three quarters, squeezing the hope out of Louisville one scoring drive at a time.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of proud of myself for looking ahead and forgetting the plays before,\u201d the sophomore said.\n\n\n\nThe rest of us can look back long enough to see that in one key area, sophomore Lawrence isn\u2019t measuring up to freshman Lawrence.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s throwing interceptions at four times the rate of last year \u2014 4.2 percent of his passes have been picked, as opposed to one percent in 2018. Everything else is trending along similarly to last season: completion percentage, touchdown percentage, yards per attempt. There are still a ton of good plays, but there are more bad plays.\n\n\n\nLawrence probably doesn\u2019t need to force some of the plays he\u2019s attempted to make \u2014 not with running back Travis Etienne (more than 300 rushing yards the past two games) and his physically superior collection of wide receivers. The play sophomore Justyn Ross made in the first half, soaring above everyone else in the end zone to come down with a touchdown reception, illustrated Clemson\u2019s talent at that position.\n\nThis is an INT or INC 99/100 times.\n\n\n\nJustyn Ross is that 1/100 kinda guy. #BigTimeCatch pic.twitter.com/KDpMnpiXgW \u2014 Cam Mellor (@PFF_Cam) October 19, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBut with his arm strength, it\u2019s tempting. Who wants to check down when you can fire rockets all over the field?\n\n\n\nLawrence is a physical specimen, 6-foot-6 and 220 pounds, with the looks of a Nordic god. But when you get past the size and the flowing hair and look him in the face, you remember that he\u2019s 20 years old \u2014 and few things in life are less predictable than 20-year-old males.\n\n\n\nEven one with the poise and confidence of Trevor Lawrence can be susceptible to momentary brain lapses. They just come as an outsized shock when the expectation of perfection, or something near to it, has been put upon a player.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople do kind of expect [perfection],\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cBut I definitely do think I can play better. I do need to make better plays, be smarter with the ball.\u201d\n\n\n\nSwinney is a great confidence builder in his players, and he had some apt analogies for his quarterback postgame. He noted former Tigers hero Deshaun Watson\u2019s penchant for interceptions his sophomore and junior seasons. He cited (and slightly mangled) a Kobe Bryant quote from five years ago: \u201cI would go 0-30 before I would go 0-9.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn other words, a confident player doesn\u2019t worry about failure and always thinks that the next play will be a great one.\n\n\n\n\u201cReally proud of Trevor,\u201d Swinney said. \u201cHe was about as bad in the first quarter as he could be. \u2026 But he don\u2019t go in a shell, he don\u2019t count. He just responds. \u2026 I love that.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaid Lawrence: \u201cKeep firing.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs a whole, Clemson is firing more cleanly this month after a one-point escape at North Carolina on Sept. 28. Winning margin the last two games: 66 points. There should be more routs in the near future.\n\n\n\nEventually, though, the Tigers\u2019 leading man and anointed superstar will have to play a cleaner game against a better opponent.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Tigers pounded Louisville on Saturday but convinced no one that they are the same team that won the title last season.
