Only Mason Mount has attempted more shots among midfielders.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Fantasy Premier League: Dream Team 2018-19 Show all 11 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Another haul away to Aston Villa is by all means possible, and a price hike would surely follow.\n\nDanny Rose\n\nGiven Tottenham\u2019s unconvincing start, it may be wise to steer clear of Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s players for now. But with Crystal Palace\u2019s visit comes hope of a turnaround in form.\n\nPalace have a decent record against the top six away from home but will hardly be the most ambitious of guests, making the likes of Rose or Toby Alderweireld worth considering.\n\nHonourable mentions: Hugo Lloris, Nicolas Otamendi, James Tarkowski, John McGinn, Sergio Aguero.", "description": "Kevin De Bruyne While Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero have taken turns to haul points, Kevin De Bruyne has been brilliantly consistent, with attacking returns each week to date.
