It's ideological fascism,\" said Piper, who also examines the politically correct world of academia in the docudrama called \"No Safe Spaces,\" now in theaters.\n\n\"'You will think like us. You will look like us. You will talk like us. And, if you don't, we will crush you. We will crush you. We will silence you,'\" he claimed.\n\nPiper pointed out to Kilmeade that \"you have people like Adam Carolla and Van Jones and Bill Maher and Dennis Prager and Dave Rubin...and then conservative Christians...agreeing that what we're creating today on our campuses is a monster \u2014 rather than academic freedom and intellectual liberty.\"\n\nDENNIS PRAGER: 'NO SAFE SPACES' SHOWS THE LEFT AS 'A PURELY DESTRUCTIVE FORCE'\n\n\"We've created a monster and it's turning around to consume us,\" he said.\n\n\"How did it happen?\" Piper asked. \"We've been teaching ideological foreclosure.
