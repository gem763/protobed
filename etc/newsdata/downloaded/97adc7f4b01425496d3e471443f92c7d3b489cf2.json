Companies in three other American cities have canceled his performances due to the allegations.\n\nWednesday's appearance in \"Macbeth\" marks the legendary tenor's first performance in the U.S. since the publication of two Associated Press stories in which numerous women said he sexually harassed them or engaged in other inappropriate behavior, including one soprano who said he grabbed her bare breast under her robe.\n\nPLACIDO DOMINGO ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT\n\nDomingo has called the allegations \"in many ways, simply incorrect,\" without providing any specifics.\n\nDomingo is general director of LA Opera, which has engaged outside counsel to conduct its investigation. He also is being investigated by the American Guild of Musical Artists, the union representing many opera employees.\n\nThe Met has said it will wait for the results of the LA Opera investigation before deciding on any action against Domingo, who is scheduled to perform at the storied opera house seven times this season.\n\nThe Met's general manager, Peter Gelb, held a one-hour meeting with chorus singers and orchestra musicians after a dress rehearsal Saturday to discuss the Mets' position on the allegations.\n\nMORE ACCUSERS COME FORWARD AGAINST OPERA STAR PLACIDO DOMINGO\n\nDALLAS OPERA CANCELS 2020 PLACIDO DOMINGO PERFORMANCE AMID SEXUAL MISCONDUCT CLAIMS\n\nIn characterizing the meeting, Gelb said, \"I said we took the allegations very seriously. For some people, allegations are enough to warrant actions, but the Met as an institution does not believe it can take action until there is corroborated evidence, which has so far not been the case.\"\n\nGelb said he also noted the Met was closely monitoring the two investigations and \"we are prepared to take action when action is merited.\"\n\nOne musician who attended the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation described the session as heated and often emotional.\n\nSome staff members were visibly emotional as they challenged Gelb, the musician said, with at least one telling him, \"This is exactly why women don't come forward.\" But one female chorus member spoke up in support of the Met's position, the musician noted.\n\nOPERA UNION INVESTIGATING PLACIDO DOMINGO SEX HARASSMENT CLAIMS\n\nSeveral attendees complained the Met was being inconsistent, referring to the 2018 firing of its famed conductor, James Levine, amid accusations that he had sexually abused several men when they were teenagers. The company initially suspended Levine in 2017 after the allegations surfaced and then severed ties with him after conducting its own investigation.\n\nDomingo was not at the staff meeting, but did participate in a previously scheduled sexual harassment seminar last week with fellow cast members, according to a Met staff member with direct knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reasons.\n\nThe AGMA launched its own investigation after saying it couldn't be certain that opera companies would thoroughly investigate the allegations or make their findings public.\n\nLOS ANGELES OPERA WON'T RELEASE DETAILS OF PLACIDO DOMINGO INVESTIGATION\n\nLOS ANGELES OPERA PROMISES 'THOROUGH INVESTIGATION' INTO PLACIDO DOMINGO ALLEGATIONS\n\nThe union's national executive director, Len Egert, told the AP that AGMA hopes its inquiry can be wrapped up \"in a couple of months.\"\n\nHe said he could not provide details, but indicated the union also is taking on board the wider problem of misconduct across the industry and the fear of retaliation by men in positions of power.\n\n\"In addition to what we have done so far, AGMA will continue to search for and implement methods to change the culture,\" he said.\n\nDomingo is scheduled to appear in three performances of \"Macbeth,\" two of them opposite the soprano Anna Netrebko, and then return to the Met for four performances of \"Madame Butterfly\" in November.\n\nPLACIDO DOMINGO GETS STANDING OVATION AMID SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS\n\nOutside the Met, Domingo's next scheduled U.S. performance is not until February, with LA Opera, which has not said how long it expects its investigation to last.\n\nThree major American companies \u2014 the Philadelphia Orchestra, the San Francisco Opera and Dallas Opera \u2014 canceled upcoming concerts starring Domingo after the AP stories were published.\n\nNone of Domingo's upcoming performances in Europe have been canceled; he has a busy fall lineup of operas and concerts in Switzerland, Russia, Austria, Germany, Spain, Italy and Poland.\n\nThe most serious allegation against Domingo comes from soprano Angela Turner Wilson, now a voice teacher in the Dallas area, who said he forcefully grabbed her breast in a makeup room during a run at the Washington Opera in 1999.\n\nPLACIDO DOMINGO CONCERTS CANCELED AMID SEX MISCONDUCT SCANDAL\n\nEUROPE TAKES WAIT-AND-SEE APPROACH TO PLACIDO DOMINGO ALLEGATIONS\n\nThe Washington Opera issued statements saying it has \"zero tolerance\" for harassment but did not receive any \"documented complaints\" about Domingo's behavior during his 15 years as artistic director and general director of the company. It has declined to comment on whether it plans any investigation.\n\nDuring its inquiry, the LA Opera \u2014 which Domingo helped found in the 1980s, and where several accusations of sexual misconduct occurred \u2014 has removed Domingo from day-to-day operations as general director, a post he has held since 2003.\n\nThe investigation is being led by Debra Wong Yang, a former U.S. attorney and Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, now a partner at the law firm of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher.\n\nPLACIDO DOMINGO HIT WITH NEW SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS\n\nIn a statement emailed to the AP, a committee of LA Opera board members urged anyone with relevant information to contact Gibson Dunn and provide statements on the record, adding that, if requested, they \"will take reasonable efforts to keep the individual's identity as confidential as possible.\"\n\nThe committee added that the LA Opera \"strictly prohibits retaliation of any kind against anyone participating in this investigation in good faith.\"\n\nThe union also has said it will allow participants to remain anonymous if they request it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSexual harassment experts say allowing confidential reports is crucial to a thorough investigation because of the fear of retaliation in an insular industry like opera.", "description": "When opera superstar Placido Domingo appeared in Europe last month after being accused of sexual harassment by multiple women, his performances were greeted with rapturous ovations.
