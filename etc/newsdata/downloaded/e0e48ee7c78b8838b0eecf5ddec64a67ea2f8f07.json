For example, Weight Watchers chocolate digestives have 237 calories per 50g, while the famous McVities biscuit only has 11 more calories but is almost half the price. Similarly, their cookies have 222 calories per 50g and cost 38p, while Maryland Cookies are 243 calories and cost 31p per 50g\n\nHis graphics reveal how some seemingly healthy alternatives may actually be stopping some people from burning fat and losing weight as they contain more calories than you might think.\n\nFor example, Weight Watchers chocolate digestives have 237 calories per 50g, while the famous McVities biscuit only has 11 more calories but is almost half the price.\n\nSimilarly, their 'low calorie' cookies have 222 calories and cost 38p per 50g, while Maryland Cookies are 243 calories and cost 31p per 50g.\n\nGraeme also warned of Cadbury's 30 percent less sugar Dairy Milk, which only has 15 calories less than the original - but does admit that it contains more fibre which is likely to fill the individual up faster.\n\nGraeme has also warned of Cadbury's 30 per cent less sugar Dairy Milk, which only has 15 calories less than the original. Taking to Instagram, the fitness expert wrote: 'The intentions of Cadbury's 'response to the obesity crisis' are commendable to an extent. But in this case, it's not the thought that counts.\n\n'One argument usually presented in favour of fruit and vegetable smoothies over fizzy drinks is inclusion of fibre. And given that these ingredients comprise of pur\u00e9ed fruit, one would assume that there would be moderate to significant amounts of fibre included, yet there is not' Graeme explained on Instagram\n\nTaking to Instagram, the fitness expert wrote: 'The intentions of Cadbury's 'response to the obesity crisis' are commendable to an extent. But in this case, it's not the thought that counts. \u2063 \u2063\n\n'The 30 per cent less sugar bar does contain 15 fewer calories per 50g. It is also presented in 35g and 85g bars which simply result in consumption of less food than the original 45g, 100g and 200g bars.\n\n'It contains nine times the amount of fibre, meaning it is more likely to satiate an individual than the original bar. \u2063 \u2063 But its branding directly points the finger at sugar being a cause of obesity. And that having 30 per cent less of it is 'working to tackle the obesity problem'.\n\nGraeme shared that half an avocado has the same amount of calories as a pack of smarties\n\nHe's also often compared fruit smoothies to sugary fizzy drinks, saying people are misinformed when they say naturally occurring sugars are 'better' than refined.\n\nHowever Tomlinson acknowledges that healthy foods can come with additional nutrients that have health benefits, which junk food will not contain.\n\nBut he says that if weight loss is your goal, then it doesn't matter where your calories come from, you will still gain weight if you eat too many of them.\n\nHe adds: 'As for the heavily health branded innocent smoothie, it is actually very similar to the Coca-Cola.\n\n'Whilst it\u2019s inclusive micro nutrients offer functional support, this is the only noticeable difference' he wrote to his half a million followers.\n\nHe's also often compared fruit smoothies to sugary fizzy drinks, saying people are misinformed when they say naturally occurring sugars are 'better' than refined.

And, we need positive gut-health for many reasons, including successful weight management.\n\n'Every person has a different make-up of gut bacteria, which is completely personalised and different from person to person. And, studies have shown that obese subjects have a lower number of different species in their guts compared with normal weight and non-obese individuals.\n\n'Also, a greater diversity of different bacteria species in our guts has been associated with achieving, and more importantly maintaining a healthy weight, and this is greatly influenced by what we eat. So the foods we eat as you can see are very important to long-term successful weight management.'", "description": "Graeme Tomlinson, 31, from Aberdeen, who is known as The Fitness Chef online, says that all you need to do to avoid weight gain is to track your calories and remain in a deficit.", "authors": ["Bridie Pearson-Jones For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/11/19581976-0-image-a-2_1570788229492.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
