She paid her dues; her ambition never waned; and she was there, there being New York in the late \u201960s and \u201970s \u2014 a city full of garbage, rent-controlled apartments, and men and women discovering new ways of making art and music. Harry\u2019s story is an illuminating one, considering how much New York has changed and how stars are made and marketed today.\n\nIn her new memoir, \u201cFace It,\u201d Harry describes a life formed by the desire that, one way or another, she\u2019d leave suburbia and become a performer, a desire she shared with Patti Smith, Stevie Nicks and Chrissie Hynde, three other women who influenced post-\u201960s music. (Hail, hail the women of rock-and-roll, especially those who qualify for an AARP membership!) That Harry succeeded is a tribute to her ambition, perseverance, talent and good looks.\n\nThe book opens with her heart-rending origin story. Harry\u2019s mother gave her up for adoption, reluctantly, in 1945, when Harry \u2014 whose given name was Angela Tremble \u2014 was 3 months old. Harry was raised in Hawthorne, N.J., by Richard and Cathy Harry in a migrant worker\u2019s house near a park, where Harry spent most of her free time on her own, daydreaming \u2014 a tomboy who loved to play in the woods with her dog, Pal. Seeing a show at Radio City Music Hall piqued her interest in becoming a stage performer. She knew there was more to life than being a high school majorette and later, in junior college, a sorority sister. By age 20 Harry was living in the East Village, on St. Marks Place, where, listening to the sounds of the city, she felt like she was \u201cin the place where my next life would begin.\u201d And so it did.\n\n[Patti Smith looks back at a heartbreaking year]\n\nHarry quickly took to the artistically combustible downtown scene, watching acts like the Velvet Underground and Janis Joplin, and playing \u201canti-music music\u201d with a fellow who called himself Charlie Nothing. She befriended street people and later the drag queen Divine. Ditching her secretarial job at the BBC to work in a head shop, Harry navigated the edges of new sensibilities. She had a hookup with an Andy Warhol protege in a phone booth in Max\u2019s Kansas City and began what she blithely calls \u201cchipping and dipping\u201d in heroin. (Harry is quite explicit in her descriptions of her drug use and sex life.)\n\n\n\nDebbie Harry in a childhood photo. Born in Miami, she was adopted by a family in New Jersey. (Harry family)\n\nDebbie Harry calls her music a \u201ccrossover between glitter-glam and punk.\u201d (Dennis McGuire)\n\nThe chapters about the New York scene and Harry\u2019s early adventures making music are the most compelling parts of the book. We\u2019re in her environment \u2014 smelling the garbage piled up on the street, trolling the sidewalks for discarded clothing, stepping over drunks on the Bowery. Life was DIY. About her experience playing at the notorious club CBGB, birthplace of punk, Harry writes, \u201cIt was a time of felt experience \u2014 no special effects, just raw, visceral, uncut living.\u201d Nothing seemed to faze her. There were loft fires and relocations, and she once was raped at knife point: \u201cI can\u2019t say that I felt a lot of fear,\u201d she writes of the experience. \u201cI\u2019m very glad this happened before AIDS or I might have freaked.\u201d In these chapters, Harry is introspective, as she writes about death, time and the serendipitous, sometimes hazardous life she was living.\n\nIn 1974, she and her lover, guitarist Chris Stein, founded Blondie. After playing in New York\u2019s punk scene, the group gradually rose to stardom and soon toured with Iggy Pop, David Bowie and Television. By 1979, Blondie\u2019s song \u201cHeart of Glass\u201d was No. 1 on the American charts, and the band\u2019s popularity blossomed. Unfortunately, fame can make for a rather dull narrative. Once Harry digs into Blondie\u2019s heyday, the book suffers in ways other rock memoirs often do \u2014 rehashing the next album, the next tour and so on.\n\nMore engaging is Harry\u2019s effort to categorize her music, which she calls a \u201ccrossover between glitter-glam and punk.\u201d She\u2019s reluctant to name disco as an obvious influence, instead insistently aligning herself with punk. But she was familiar with disco \u2014 music favored by the drag queens she watched in underground clubs. She also loved drag\u2019s performative qualities, especially its attention to fashion and gesture, two practices Harry perfected while shaping her own image. Drag queens saw Harry\u2019s display of femininity as drag, \u201ca woman playing a man\u2019s idea of a woman.\u201d Harry\u2019s words are more revealing: \u201cI\u2019m not blind and I\u2019m not stupid: I take advantage of my looks and I use them.\u201d\n\n[We know about E. Jean Carroll\u2019s rape accusation. How is the rest of her book?]\n\nHer commentary on the sexual politics of the music scene of her time are insightful. Rock, she writes, \u201cwas a very masculine business in the mid-seventies.\u201d Patti Smith \u201cdressed more masculine \u2026 my approach was different. . . . I was playing up the idea of being a very feminine woman while fronting a male rock band in a highly macho game. I was saying things in the songs that female singers didn\u2019t really say back then. I wasn\u2019t submissive or begging him to come back. I was kicking his a--, kicking him out, kicking my own a \u2014 too. My Blondie character was an inflatable doll but with a dark, provocative, aggressive side. I was playing it up but I was very serious.\u201d\n\nDespite rapid and worldwide fame, Blondie disbanded in 1982. Harry\u2019s soul mate, Stein, broke up with her, and she went on to make solo albums. Faced with mounting debt, for a short while Harry became a professional wrestler but had better luck making movies, most notably John Waters\u2019s \u201cHairspray.\u201d She would have appeared in the original \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d had her record company not forbidden it. In 1997, Blondie reformed and continues to tour.\n\nThe strange final chapters of \u201cFace It\u201d include a rambling poem Harry wrote about 9/11 and a plea to save honeybees. Throughout this visually evocative book are photographs and a lengthy gallery of fan art. Readers, both familiar and unfamiliar with Harry\u2019s career, will enjoy this memoir because on nearly every page she proves she\u2019s more than just a pretty blonde in a pair of tight pants. If she sometimes comes across as self-interested, so what? She was a young woman who fell under the spell of New York and made herself into the performer she always knew she\u2019d become, one who went on to cast her own spell on millions of listeners.\n\nSibbie O\u2019Sullivan is a former teacher in the Honors College at the University of Maryland.
