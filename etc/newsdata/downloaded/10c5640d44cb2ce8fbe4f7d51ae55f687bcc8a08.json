Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman is scheduled to hold a press briefing on Tuesday evening in Jeddah.\n\nEstimates of when, and how much, of the 5.7 million barrels a day of shut output would be back online have fluctuated since the attack. Significant volumes could come back within days, people familiar with the matter said over the weekend, adding that it could still take weeks to restore full capacity. Brent futures rose 19% in a matter of seconds at the open on Monday and ended the day up 15%, their biggest single-day advance.\n\nThe worst ever sudden disruption to global oil supplies continues to reverberate as geopolitical risk premiums soar on concern over instability in the Middle East and a potential retaliation against Iran, which the U.S. has blamed for the strikes.\n\nBrent for November settlement fell $4.09 to $64.92 a barrel at 10:12 a.m. in London. Ten unmanned drones damaged one of the Saudis\u2019 flagship fields and a key processing complex Saturday, triggering one of the wildest bouts of trading seen in oil markets.\n\nWTI for October slid $3.48 to $59.42 a barrel, after declining as much as 5.6% The U.S. benchmark\u2019s discount to Brent for the same month narrowed to $5.54.\n\nSaudi Aramco is firing up idle offshore oil fields -- part of its cushion of spare capacity -- to replace some of the lost production, a person familiar said earlier. Customers are also being supplied using stockpiles, though some are being asked to accept different grades of crude. The kingdom has enough domestic inventories to cover about 26 days of exports, according to consultant Rystad Energy A/S.\n\nThe disruption surpasses the loss of Kuwaiti and Iraqi petroleum output in August 1990, when Saddam Hussein invaded his neighbor. It also exceeds the loss of Iranian oil production in 1979 during the Islamic Revolution, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: David Marino in New York at dmarino4@bloomberg.net;Sheela Tobben in New York at vtobben@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Pratish Narayanan\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Oil plunged nearly 7% in London after Reuters reported Saudi Arabia is close to restoring 70% of the oil production it lost after this weekend\u2019s attack on a key crude facility in the kingdom.Brent crude dropped to as low as $64.48 a barrel on the report, which cited an unidentified Saudi", "authors": ["David Marino", "Sheela Tobben"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/M5VfQ9QYvW8OeA9dLUKNKw--~B/aD0xMzY4O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/d9ab8617140f1375c3c79d57a350b74b", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
