REUTERS/Peter Cziborra\n\nOn the eve of leading his team into a World Cup semi-final against Wales on Sunday, Kolisi is focussed on delivering another cherishable moment in the history of rugby in South Africa and as country as a whole.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s victory on home soil at the 1995 World Cup, with Nelson Mandela presenting the Webb Ellis trophy to captain Francois Pienaar just one year after the end of apartheid, is seen as a springboard for change in the country.\n\nKolisi, as South Africa\u2019s first black captain, knows delivering another World Cup in Japan could have a similar boost back home.\n\n\u201cWe do have many different races in our country, and 11 different languages,\u201d Kolisi said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt is one of the positives of our country. I think it\u2019s really beautiful. That\u2019s why we are called the \u2018Rainbow Nation\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the team as well we have different races, which is really beautiful.\u201d\n\nKolisi\u2019s promotion to captain last year was seen by many as a crucial step for South Africa, as rugby continues to break the shackles of its past image in a country where racial tensions in sport often spill over into politics.\n\nKolisi is aware of the responsibility on his broad shoulders and embraces it.\n\n\u201cIt just shows that when we decide to work together for one goal or as a team and as a country, we can make anything happen, and achieve all the goals and dreams,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we want to give our best this week, and hopefully play in the final next week. It would be huge for our country, as I\u2019ve seen what it has done for the country before.\n\n\u201cI was old enough to remember the 2007 World Cup \u2013 I remember what it did for the country then, and I know what it would do now.\u201d", "description": "Springboks captain Siya Kolisi knows what an impact winning the Rugby World Cup can have on his country, having seen how uplifting victories in 1995 and 2007 were for South Africa.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445119987&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P04Z", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
