She looked like she'd just stepped out of an Ossie Clark fashion show I'd seen over there. She had this exquisite chiselled face and looked like a movie star, you know, with the Titian hair. It was just my aesthetic. I'd found a kindred spirit. It was as strong as our relationship with our work, we were destined to be together.\n\nLinda: It was like a romantic relationship, really.\n\nJenny: Yes, it was completely like falling in love. We fell into creative love.\n\nAFR: Have you ever had an argument?\n\nLinda: No.\n\nJenny: (at the same time): Yeah, all the time.\n\nJenny Kee and Linda Jackson dressing up in 1975. William Yang\n\nJenny: Where were we here? (above) It would have been some do. Who knows? We were always out.\n\nLinda: Sometimes we would arrive at places and be dressed almost exactly the same, without having consulted each other.\n\nJenny: But most of the time we called each other before we went out. We loved dressing up. We wanted to look alike, we wanted to be like twins. I mean come on, you don't care about any of that now, but look at you, you're beautiful there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinda: I still have those clothes.\n\nJenny: Well, good. So you should.\n\nLinda: Jenny was just about to open the shop so I got to go in and see it, and then she started stocking my clothes.\n\nJenny: She had this amazing collection of clothing made from vintage prints that I fell in love with and bought right there on the spot. And Linda became the crown jewel of the shop. Pretty quickly you could see it was all about her designs. We were the first fashion shop in The Strand. Up until that point, it was all tailors, milliners, cobblers. Flamingo Park was all very homegrown. I came unstuck when [my later business partners] tried to make me this big global success. Not being at all disrespectful, but someone like Carla Zampatti was a businesswoman, [and she was] set on something bigger than us. We were much more interested in our own backyard.\n\nLinda: And people loved it.\n\nJenny: Talk about \"it's time\". It was time for those clothes. It was a creative country. The film industry was booming, Australian music was huge. Everyone was having the most tremendous time.\n\nLinda: People had gone overseas and come back and said, 'I want to do all that fun stuff they're doing over there, here.' And so we all did.\n\n\"Mask Goddess\", which was designed by Jenny Kee and used in the Sydney 2000 Olympics Opening Ceremony. Marinco Kojdanovski\n\nJenny: We didn\u2019t have any macho energy around us at the time. It was an amazing scene, no competition. We were feminists without having to raise any banner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinda: Even though they did want to speak to your husband when you wanted a bank loan.\n\nJenny: And your husband was a woman [Linda\u2019s former partner was photographer Fran Moore].\n\nLinda: So you had to make do with what you already had. So if you couldn't afford expensive things you would just use calico.\n\nJenny: Linda made the most exquisite evening dresses out of calico.\n\nLinda: We were free to do what we wanted. We didn't want to be European, we wanted to be ourselves. And we were doing something more outrageous here than they were doing anyway. There was this idea at the time that knitting was for old ladies in the Country Women\u2019s Association. But when I was in Paris as a young woman I went to a Dior show, and the respect for those clothes, that are also bespoke and handmade \u2026 you think, well, you know what else is bespoke and handmade? Knitting! And I think we did something to show how special that world was.\n\nJenny: We made things to last.\n\nLinda: Before sustainability became a buzzword. We found these exquisite fabrics and we wanted to use them, not because they needed to be recycled but because we knew they would look beautiful.\n\nJenny: We get stopped all the time by people who say they still have their Jenny Kee jumpers.\n\nLinda Jackson's Black Opal Flash outfit. Marinco Kojdanovski\n\nLinda: The passion for colour just goes back forever. I would wear colour to a funeral. Definitely. I mean, why not? The person would expect us to be ourselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenny: That\u2019s why Anna and Luke [Anna Sales and Luke Plunkett, of fashion label Romance Was Born] loved us. The colour. We met them because they'd studied us at fashion school. And someone said to me, you\u2019ve got to see these new designers, Romance was Born, they're so much like you ... but they're not ... but they are.\n\nLinda: We helped them with their 10-year anniversary show, at Paris Couture Week. They wanted to do something special.\n\nJenny: It was like seeing a Linda Jackson show, it was amazing. But they did it in their own way. Linda would never do all that sexy-sexy stuff. But they are the only fashion people, really, who have come into our circle in that way.\n\nLinda: It was amazing to be just the artist, you know, you can let go of that responsibility of designing. I painted a waratah on this exquisite piece of silk. And I go in and Luke is carving it up with scissors, just hacking away, and I thought, 'Oh god!' I could never have done that. But I'd given it to him and he could do whatever he wanted. That's part of letting go.\n\nLinda Jackson and Jenny Kee in front of the backdrop for the Flamingo Follies Bondi show in 1975. Annie Noon\n\nLinda: Most of our shows were big theatrical events. On all of our pamphlets and programs, we'd have Jenny's drawings of us, the little caricatures, and Michael's [artist Michael Ramsden, Kee\u2019s ex-husband] artwork. My dad was a printer so he'd print them for us. These curtains we're standing in front of were for the show, and we hung them in my studio on Bondi Road afterwards.\n\nJenny: They'd never seen anything like our shows. We wanted [them] to be completely different. We set the first one to reggae music.\n\nLinda: The music was such a big part of it. And we chose models with some personality and fun. Now the models can't have fun, they're perfectly positioned so that they all look exactly the same and it's all perfect for Instagram.\n\nLinda Jackson's 1974 Opera House outfit. Linda Jackson\n\nJenny: The shows got so big. So many people wanted to come that we would have two shows on the one day. We would squash everyone in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenny: The Australiana thing? It wasn't conscious, it was just something we truly loved. We wanted to celebrate this country we both loved. And there was a real sense of patriotism at the time. The Opera House had just opened, there was a real buzz. [Art curator] Ace Bourke always said that when he first came back to Australia after living in London, he came to Flamingo Park first and then to the Opera House. In that order.\n\nLinda: The Opera House dress was my first applique dress. Those images were just there, in our psyche, we just loved them.\n\nJenny Kee's \"Cockatoo\" knit. Marinco Kojdanovski\n\nJenny: The Opera House was opening, so Linda made a dress \u2013 it just made sense. As for all the koalas, well, I was making the zip-up cardigans from a pattern. And the pattern had a gun on it. I thought: that's not me. So I found a pattern for a child\u2019s cardigan and it happened to have a koala on it. And it was like that! It wasn't like, I'm going to create Australian clothes, it was just that I loved them.\n\nLinda: It was staring us in the face, really.\n\nJenny Kee designed this Bolivian wool outfit entitled \"Frida Exotica\" for the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Marinco Kojdanovski\n\nJenny: This (above) was for the 2000 Olympics. I had to design an outfit that represented Africa and the Americas, so this was inspired by Frida Kahlo. It was a beautiful original Bolivian wool, hand-dyed in the late '70s. I went back to a man who I used to buy this wool from in the '70s and he still had some, would you believe it? And this was beautiful. It was like, the couture Olympics. Every detail was perfect. We were told that during the telecast they might home the camera in on the shoulder, so everything had to be perfect. They didn't, though [rolls eyes].\n\nJenny Kee in one of her\"Koala\" knits in her store in 1974. Supplied\n\nLinda: The store was a hub, it was a meeting place. And Jenny would lean over the balcony and cooee to everyone.\n\nJenny: Well, I couldn't when we first started. There was no one else there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinda: After Grace [Kee\u2019s daughter, Grace Heifetz] was born, her mum would come in and work in the shop. And people would come in just to see Jenny\u2019s mum.\n\nJenny: They would! My mother was extremely stylish. She nearly got run over once because she was dreaming of this particular pocket she wanted for a skirt. When Mum came to work in the shop after Grace was born, she was the quality control. Nothing got past her.\n\nLinda: Lauren Bacall used to come in and have a ciggie with her. Do you remember that?\n\nJenny: Yes! Well, all sorts of people came into the shop \u2013 David Bowie, Billy Joel, and yeah, Lauren Bacall. I loved her. She was so stroppy. And she adored my mother. Mum could talk to her \u2013 really talk to her \u2013 about all the old movies. She used to come in every other day when she was here in Sydney [appearing in the Tennessee Williams play Sweet Bird of Youth] and have a ciggie with Mum. I think she liked that Mum was as tough an old broad as she was. You know, Mum wasn\u2019t a Hollywood star or anything, but she was a force to be reckoned with.\n\nLinda Jackson and Jenny Kee in 1978 with Grace, Kee's daughter near Kee's house in NSW's Blackheath. Supplied\n\nJenny: That is such a beautiful photo of us in the bush (above). It's at my house. We're not made up, that\u2019s just how we are. Just ourselves. Grace would have been about 3 there. She's wearing a little rose petal skirt, Linda made that. We would dress her like a little mini-me, whatever we wore we would make a little version for her too. She was very cool.\n\nLinda: That's very behind the scenes, that was our real life.\n\nJenny Kee and Linda Jackson: Step Into Paradise, 17 Oct-22 March, Powerhouse Museum, Sydney.\n\nThe September issue of AFR Magazine is out on Friday, August 30 inside The Australian Financial Review.
