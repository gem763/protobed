(Nick Wass)\n\nThe NFL\u2019s quarterbacking landscape shifted this week, a sudden lurch in the direction it had been firmly headed. Drew Brees, Ben Roethlisberger and Eli Manning will be spectators Sunday afternoon, either injured or benched. Their absence will further highlight the league\u2019s bulge of young quarterbacks. Owing to both early-season attrition and preference, 17 Week 3 starting quarterbacks \u2014 more than half the league \u2014 will have entered the NFL in the past four years, nine of them either rookies or in their second year.\n\nThe arrival of so many young quarterbacks reflects the way franchises have evolved in building around passers. Of those 17 starters with less than four years of experience, only four are definitively stopgaps with little likelihood of becoming a franchise quarterback. Not all of them will work out, but a good chunk of the NFL has identified its desired future quarterback. The teams who succeed will be the ones who most wisely build around them.\n\nSunday\u2019s marquee game will provide a model for that task. The meeting between Patrick Mahomes\u2019s Kansas City Chiefs and Lamar Jackson\u2019s Baltimore Ravens will showcase not only two of the NFL\u2019s incandescent young quarterbacks, but also two franchises who understand the importance of catering their operations to them. They have both shown it\u2019s not enough to develop a talented quarterback. The point is to also develop the right system and personnel around the talented quarterback.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done what other teams do with their quarterbacks to show their talent,\u201d Ravens backup quarterback Robert Griffin III said. \u201cThe Patriots, right? They do what they have to do to get [Tom] Brady guys that do things that Brady does well. Whether you\u2019re a pocket-passing quarterback or a dual-threat quarterback, it doesn\u2019t matter. The team just has to build it around what we do best. That\u2019s what the Ravens have done here.\"\n\n[Lamar Jackson is off to a scorching start, making the Ravens an AFC contender]\n\nThe NFL\u2019s salary structure incentivizes teams to play quarterbacks when they are young. The Seattle Seahawks first showed the power of building around a young \u2014 and therefore inexpensive \u2014 quarterback when they constructed a dominant roster and innovative system around Russell Wilson earlier this decade.\n\nMeanwhile, the proliferation of youthful play-callers ascending to head coaching positions has led to the NFL\u2019s embrace of offensive concepts that had been the sole domain of high school and college football, and the shift has hastened the transition of many young quarterbacks. In some cases, particularly the pairing of first overall pick Kyler Murray with former Texas Tech head coach Kliff Kingsbury on the Arizona Cardinals, it has allowed quarterbacks to expand on a base of knowledge rather than learning a new one.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more maybe a comfort factor,\u201d Oklahoma Coach Lincoln Riley said this offseason. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than an NFL quarterback, a Drew Brees or Tom Brady, that ends up in a similar system for a lot of years. These guys started in this similar system when they were 12 years old, if not younger. They just kind of got a lot of stock built up in it. They understand it. They understand the concepts. They\u2019ve had rep after rep after rep over a long period of time.\u201d\n\n[How Kyler Murray went from a 5-foot-5 high school star to NFL's most anticipated QB]\n\nFor years, NFL coaches bemoaned the rise of the spread offense, which they believed made it difficult to evaluate and train quarterback prospects, while resisting concepts that had taken over the college game. Those coaches have largely been left behind, passed by coaches eager to take advantage of what those quarterbacks have been trained to do well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great what the colleges are doing \u2014 they\u2019re throwing the ball around,\u201d Chiefs Coach Andy Reid said. \u201cWhen we get them, they know how to do that. And then you can evaluate them. You\u2019re getting all these kids that come and are playing, you have this whole influx in the National Football League right now. I think it\u2019s great for the game.\u201d\n\nLike all NFL trends, franchises easing their quarterbacks\u2019 transition also traces to job security. The problem with fitting a quarterback into an existing system is that while he may eventually learn it and thrive, the lumps taken during that process will likely mean success will come once the coach has been fired.\n\n\u201cIn this league, you have to win immediately,\u201d Kingsbury said. \u201cEverybody knows that. If you\u2019re not doing things to help your first-round pick, or whoever is going to be your guy, I think you may be missing the boat. Otherwise, you\u2019re just prepping him for the next coach to come in.\"\n\n\n\nKansas City Chiefs Coach Andy Reid has built a roster and an offensive scheme that plays to the strengths of quarterback Patrick Mahomes. (Ben Margot)\n\nNobody has been more aggressive than the Ravens and Chiefs, and their approach gives something for the New York Giants to study as they usher in sixth overall pick Daniel Jones as their starter in place of Manning. The same is true of the Washington Redskins, whenever they turn to first-rounder Dwayne Haskins.\n\n\u201cThese guys got to be able to come in and play with confidence and play at a high level,\u201d Kingsbury added. \u201cYou got to be able to give them concepts and things they\u2019re comfortable with and can execute quickly. I think you\u2019re seeing more and more teams do that.\u201d\n\nThe Ravens built an offense this offseason from the ground up around Jackson, who has uncommon running ability for the position, loading their playbook with designed quarterback runs, presnap motions, play-action passes and run-pass option plays, or RPOs. They also chose Marquise Brown, the fastest wide receiver in the draft, to take advantage of Jackson\u2019s ability on deep passes and soften up other areas of opponents\u2019 pass coverage.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t even recognize the things he\u2019s not good at,\u201d Reid said. \u201cBecause the coaches don\u2019t put him in that position. That\u2019s the trick.\u201d\n\nReid has done the same for Mahomes, drafted in 2017. The Chiefs built a fleet of blazing receivers who can exploit Mahomes\u2019s extraterrestrial arm strength. Reid has been ahead of the curve in stealing from college playbooks, employing things like jet sweeps, ghost motions and RPOs.\n\n\u201cThey put speed around him,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThey throw shots. They throw screens. They check it down. They run the ball. They\u2019re not complicated. You can see what they\u2019re doing, but they do it really well.\u201d\n\n['We got it done!': The inside story of how Patrick Mahomes landed with the Chiefs]\n\nOther teams, too, have strategized to tailor their franchises to a quarterback. Baker Mayfield\u2019s college teammates notice the Cleveland Browns employing concepts borrowed from the Oklahoma system he ran under Riley. The Redskins provided Haskins comfort when they drafted one of his top receivers at Ohio State, Terry McLaurin, in the third round. In New York, Jones will have a mentor in Manning who shared a college coach with him in David Cutcliffe.\n\nYoung quarterbacks have yet to completely overtake the NFL. The Patriots, you may have noticed, are humming along just fine with Brady, their 42-year-old metronome, behind center. But guys like Jackson and Mahomes, last season\u2019s league MVP, are capable of winning right now, and teams are growing smarter in how they take advantage of their talents.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, teams bring a quarterback in and they teach him how to run an NFL offense,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cSome of those offenses don\u2019t match what kids did in high school and college. You bring a guy like Kingsbury in, and he\u2019s running a system kids are used to running from high school and college to make them more comfortable.\"\n\nGriffin speaks from personal experience. In 2012, he won the rookie of the year award playing in a Redskins offense that Coach Mike Shanahan and offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan adapted to incorporate plays and concepts from Griffin\u2019s Baylor days.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll see more of an influx of that,\" Griffin added. \"Some of the younger coaches \u2014 the [Sean] McVays, the [Matt] LaFleurs, [Kyle] Shanahan \u2014 they\u2019re willing to open up their mind with all their NFL background to run these concepts that were prevalent in college. It\u2019s not as rigid as it used to be with, \u2018This is how an NFL offense is run. We run bang eights and they only run Cover 3.\u2019 That\u2019s not what the NFL is anymore. It\u2019s cool to see.\u201d\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nDrew Brees is out, but Sean Payton isn\u2019t saying who will replace him as Saints\u2019 starter\n\nLamar Jackson is off to a historic start but he\u2019s a bad bet to win NFL MVP\n\nNo matter what the NFL does, its officiating headaches just won\u2019t go away\n\nThe NFL wanted a celebration for its 100th season. Instead it got Antonio Brown.\n\nFrom Doug Flutie to Kyler Murray: Inside the NFL\u2019s newfound embrace of short quarterbacks", "description": "Roughly half of NFL teams are starting quarterbacks who entered the league within the past four seasons.", "authors": ["Adam Kilgore", "Reporter Covering National Sports", "September At Pm", "Adam Kilgore Covers National Sports For The Washington Post.
