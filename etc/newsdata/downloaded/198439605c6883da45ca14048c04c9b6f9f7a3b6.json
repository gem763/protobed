The 5-foot-10 running back ran for 364 yards on 87 carries in 2018.\n\nThe Redskins needed to make a corresponding move to fit Smallwood onto the roster, and Marshall\u2019s release fits the bill. It would have been curious for Washington to carry five running backs on the roster in Week 1.\n\nRunning back Shaun Wilson could still be placed on injured reserve, as he has been out with an ankle injury, which would bring the depth chart down to four backs: Adrian Peterson, Derrius Guice, Chris Thompson and Smallwood.\n\nWashington also waived Samaje Perine from that positional group Saturday. The Cincinnati Bengals claimed Perine off waivers Sunday, per reports.\n\nThe Redskins open the season Sept. 8 against Smallwood\u2019s former team in Philadelphia.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
