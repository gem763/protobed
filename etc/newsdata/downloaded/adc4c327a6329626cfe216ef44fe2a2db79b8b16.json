The charter of the committee was to advise on ways to eliminate obstacles to drilling and mining, including for minerals, faced by companies.\n\nThe committee, which was quietly terminated earlier this year, recommended at the time that Interior \u201crevise, clarify and simplify process for granting varying royalty rate for declining or particularly costly fields.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental groups in 2017 had asked a federal judge in Montana to disband the advisory board and strike down its recommendations.\n\nAn Interior spokesperson denied that the latest proposal was pulled from the committee\u2019s recommendations.\n\nWednesday\u2019s draft proposal follows a concerted effort by the Trump administration to jump-start the mining of what are known as \u201ccritical minerals,\u201d or elements considered key to national security.\n\n\u201cThis would improve the BLM\u2019s ability to provide relief to producers of non-energy solid leasable minerals, from burdens, such as geological hardships and market transformations,\u201d the proposal reads.\n\nThe administration first indicated in 2017 that it was looking at steps to boost mineral production when Trump signed an executive order to ensure there was a suitable supplies of critical minerals.\n\nThe administration in 2018 expanded the list of critical minerals from 23 to 35, adding uranium to the list for the first time. The Commerce Department in June issued a recommendation to help speed up production of all critical minerals on the list. The report argued that \u201cassured supply of critical minerals and the resiliency of their supply chains are essential to the economic prosperity and national defense of the United States.\u201d\n\nFurther, a government working group established by Trump this summer is expected to make an announcement as early as Thursday over whether the administration should further incentivize uranium mining in the U.S.\n\n\"While this proposed rule doesn't specifically mention uranium, the rule would apply to any uranium deposits found on acquired lands, as the mineral would be considered as leasable at that point,\" an Interior spokesperson told The Hill.\n\nWednesday's proposed rule explicitly says it would meet the requirements laid out in Trump\u2019s 2017 executive order.\n\n\u201cThis proposed rule would meet the goals\u201d of the order \u201cby improving the BLM\u2019s ability to ensure continued production of critical minerals on public lands,\u201d the proposal reads.\n\nThe text of the proposal also says the rule would give the agency \u201cmore flexibility to respond to changing market dynamics by improving the BLM\u2019s ability to boost production and support development of the federal mineral estate when deemed necessary.\u201d\n\nThe administration estimated that in 2017 nonenergy mineral mining in the country contributed $13.4 billion to the national economy. The proposed rule expects to save the industry $5 million in regulatory costs in the next decade.\n\nThe draft rule will be published in the Federal Register next week.", "description": "The Trump administration is proposing a rule to make it easier for mineral mining companies to lower their royalty rates and cut fees.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/mining.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
