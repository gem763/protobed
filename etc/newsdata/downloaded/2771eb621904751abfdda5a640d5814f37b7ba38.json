The court heard Free lurked in the Kmart toy section corridors before telling her to 'follow me'\n\nThe family are asking the public to donate to the fund to ensure she 'gets all of the assistance she needs in the future, whatever those needs may be.\n\n'This beautiful, tiny girl has a lifetime of recovery from trauma ahead of her and deserves to be compensated for her ordeal.'\n\nFree is a father of twin baby girls\n\nAll money raised in the campaign, which has a goal of $20,000, will go directly into a trust account set up for the seven-year-old for her to access for treatment as she gets older.\n\nA spokeswoman for GoFundMe told Daily Mail Australia the fundraiser was being held anonymously to protect the girl's identity - but said they were in communication with the family.\n\nFree, a 27-year-old father of twin baby girls, will be eligible for parole from August 10, 2021, just two-and-a-half years after he was first locked up.\n\nHe kidnapped the little girl from the toy aisle of Kmart in Westfield North Lakes in December 2018.\n\nHe took her to remote Pumicestone Passage about 30 minutes away, sexually assaulted her and returned her to the centre more than an hour later.\n\nThe court heard while driving back to the shops Free 'snapped out of it' and broke down in tears \u2014 'feeling horrible' about what he had done and how the girl's mother would react.\n\nKmart predator Sterling Free lured a little girl from the Kmart toy aisle and sexually assaulted her in bushland. Her family have now launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for her treatment\n\nThe little girl reportedly asked 'if he was okay' when she saw him crying.\n\nFree's lenient sentence was condemned around the nation, with petitions created demanding the state appeal receiving thousands of signatures in a matter of days.\n\n'It is yet another pathetic example of how our legal system has very little to do with justice for survivors of crime and even less to do with protecting our children from known threats,' one of the petitions read.\n\n'We... implore the QLD Attorney General Ms D'Ath, to appeal this sentence and show that we as a community are being heard, and our justifiable concerns are being addressed.'\n\nQueensland Attorney-General Yvette D'Ath has 30 days to seek a review of the sentence.\n\nThe little girl was searching the toy aisles for a present while her mother stood nearby, when the predator led her away\n\nStirling Free kidnapped the little girl from the toy aisle of Kmart in Westfield North Lakes in December 2018\n\nHome Affairs Minister Peter Dutton also expressed his frustration over the lenient sentence.\n\nHe described it as 'grossly inadequate' and asked for the case to be appealed.\n\n'To have this young girl tried the way that she was by this animal is unacceptable. That he wouldn't go to jail for a longer period of time doesn't reflect community standards.\n\n'The community in Queensland, the ACT, anywhere across the country, expect our most vulnerable to be taken care of. It doesn't send a message of deterrence to somebody who can assault a young child, an infant or a young girl and not receive an appropriate penalty'.", "description": "Sterling Mervyn Free, 27, was jailed for eight years last Friday, with a Queensland judge describing his crime as 'abhorrent' and 'every parent's worse nightmare'.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/02/19816538-0-image-a-78_1571275739564.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
