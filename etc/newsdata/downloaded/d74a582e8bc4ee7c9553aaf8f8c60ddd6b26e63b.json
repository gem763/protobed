(Photo: Jeff Kravitz, FilmMagic)\n\nFive months after giving birth to her first child, Amy Schumer is opening up about having mixed feelings being back at work.\n\nThe comedian, 38, began performing stand-up again two weeks after giving birth (a move that was met with many a mom-shamer at the time) and says now that she's happy to be back, but misses and loves baby Gene \"so much it hurts.\"\n\n\"I'm feeling strong and good and like I\u2019m still a human being with interests and ambitions and goals I\u2019m excited to reach,\" Schumer reflected in the description of an Instagram post, showing her cuddling with her son.\n\nShe continued: \"It\u2019s felt good to be back at work. I was so worried about it and was afraid to go back after he was 3 months old. A couple days I\u2019ve cried from missing him. But it\u2019s mostly good to be back and the breaks energize me to be a better mom and appreciate our time even more. I have it a lot easier than many people but I wanted to share my experience.\"\n\nSchumer's post was met with overwhelming positivity from fellow famous moms.\n\n\"This is so important to say,\" Jenna Bush Hager commented.\n\nDebra Messing wrote about returning to act on \"Will and Grace\" after the birth of her son.\n\n\"Omg, my body hurt from his absence,\" Messing commented. \"I felt a physical yearning, and I questioned myself, and felt guilty, and would cry. It was hard. I\u2019d feel such moments of joy making people laugh. I\u2019d get lost in the work and it energized me and empowered me. And then I\u2019d get home and literally sprint to his crib and rock him, feeling like I was HOME. It\u2019s hard, being a working mom. But I believe that we are better mom\u2019s when we are able to do what fulfills us. One hour at a time, Amy.\"\n\nDrew Barrymore shared her own experiences after having kids and applauded Schumer for speaking out.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t care about anything. Everything seemed trivial if it wasn\u2019t about my kids,\" she wrote. \"But after time, things fall into the new place. Not the old. Old is gone. Forever changed by a love that is indescribable! And it just seems to get better and better every day! I am no longer interested in myself as me. It\u2019s being their mom. That\u2019s who i am now. Your are such a cool person Amy! Your kid is gonna he so proud of you!\"\n\nPadma Lakshmi added that having her daughter \"made me stop worrying about the little things.\"\n\nMORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/06/amy-schumer-opens-up-going-back-work-after-welcoming-baby/3892160002/", "description": "Five months after giving birth to her first child, Amy Schumer is opening up about having mixed feelings being back at work.", "authors": ["Hannah Yasharoff", "Published P.M.
