NHK said Faxai was the strongest storm in the Tokyo area in several years.\n\nIn the neighboring city of Ichikawa, winds were occasionally strong enough to shake buildings, while biting rain fell. Streets normally busy with commuters walking or bicycling to the train station were deserted.\n\nSome 5,000 people were ordered to evacuate, more than half in the tourist city of Kamakura just south of Tokyo, because of the danger of landslides, NHK said, but there were no immediate reports of major damage.\n\nParts of the Tokaido Shinkansen line were halted, as was the Yamanote Line, a Tokyo commuter line.\n\nFaxai, which is moving rapidly, is expected to head out to sea by around noon on Monday, although winds are expected to linger for a while.\n\n(Story refiled to correct spelling of \u201csea\u201d, paragraph 9)", "description": "One of the strongest typhoons to hit the Japanese capital in recent years made landfall just east of Tokyo on Monday, bringing record-breaking winds, stinging rain and sending some rivers close to the top of their banks.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
