They're just getting on with everything. Do you think talking about it is actually solving anything?'\n\nJanet Street Porter declared that she wasn't going to allow the British press to be slandered during the heated debate about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's ITV documentary\n\nBut Gloria insisted that Harry's comments about being on a 'different path' to William were in line with his new role as a husband and dad, and said that the press had 'escalated' the issue.\n\nAnd Stacey Solomon agreed, saying: 'If you give them nothing, they're going to make it up anyway.'\n\nDespite defending the royal couple against the press scrutiny they have received since the ITV documentary aired, Gloria admitted that she didn't believe a programme was the right way to go about it.\n\n'They did a wonderful job in Africa and they had a great trip. But then it took the shine off for me completely by announcing that they were going to go for the press.\n\nStacey argued in favour of the royal couple's documentary by insisting that it was a good that the couple spoke out\n\nGloria Hunniford shared her thoughts on the comments Harry made to Tom Bradby about his relationship with brother William during the ITV documentary\n\n'They could have waited until they got home. It was bad timing.\n\n'I have great empathy for Meghan for being a new mum, and empathy for the job they have to do. But I don't think a documentary is the place to talk about that,' the broadcaster added.\n\nMeanwhile, Stacey commended Meghan for being open about her struggles.\n\n'The stiff upper lip has damaged us as a society. It's good that people are breaking away from that and saying, \"do you know what, I'm going to be entirely honest\".'\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex admitted that it had been a struggle to be a new mum amid all the press scrutiny\n\nStacey refused to side with Janet as she claimed that Meghan had done the right thing by speaking out\n\n'The stiff upper lip hasn't worked for a very long time. I think male suicide is a problem, mental health is a huge problem in our society and the stiff upper lip hasn't got us anywhere.'\n\nReiterating the struggles of mental health regardless of privilege, Stacey insisted: 'I had a child at 19 with no money and no support. Nothing.\n\n'I couldn't afford anything for my child. I had to get milk vouchers and everything.\n\n'I've had two children since then outside of that, and in a much more comfortable and privileged position. And I can tell you that I felt the same feelings each time.'\n\n'I have struggled with my mental health equally each time regardless of my circumstances,' she added.", "description": "On today's Loose Women, Janet Street-Porter said that she sympathised with Meghan, but argued that she should follow the example of the Queen and Prince Charles by not airing grievances publicly.", "authors": ["Deepika Rajani For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/15/20086162-0-image-a-17_1571840064105.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
