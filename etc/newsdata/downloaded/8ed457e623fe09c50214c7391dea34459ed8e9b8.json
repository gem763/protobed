If the U.K. refused to do so, it could still crash out without a trade agreement unless the two sides could wrap one up in just six months.\n\nThat negotiation promises to be one of the most complex either side has ever undertaken as they unpick 50 years of trade policy. Previous EU commercial accords have taken several years to reach. It took the bloc five years to strike market-opening accords with Japan and Canada and 20 to get a deal with the Mercosur group of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\nWhile the elimination of tariffs featured prominently in those accords, EU-U.K. talks would aim to maintain the continuation of duty-free trade across the Channel while focusing on a much trickier matter: the future alignment of British regulatory standards with those of the bloc.\n\nThis is a very politically sensitive issue in the EU, where concerns are widespread that the U.K. intends to become a deregulated \u201cSingapore-on-Thames\u201d capable of undercutting European environmental, social and other norms. Johnson did nothing to ease these concerns by moving his predecessor\u2019s commitments in this area out of the Withdrawal Agreement and into the non-binding Political Declaration on future EU-U.K. ties.\n\nBy their nature, the negotiations on a free-trade agreement between the EU and Britain will be more complicated than Brexit by involving not just the defensive interests of the bloc\u2019s 27 remaining member countries but also their offensive goals. These range from Spain\u2019s desire for access to U.K. fishing waters to France\u2019s eye on dairy-export markets.\n\nAs with the two years of negotiations over the Brexit deal, the EU27 will have plenty of leverage when it comes to the negotiations on a trade accord -- but the U.K. won\u2019t have the luxury of time.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jonathan Stearns in Brussels at jstearns2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Jonathan Stearns, Edward Evans\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up\u00a0to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us\u00a0@Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe\u00a0to our podcast.Boris Johnson\u2019s failure to lead Britain out of the European Union as promised on Oct. 31 leaves his country facing an even bigger crunch moment next year.Even if he can eventually deliver Brexit, the U.K. prime", "authors": ["Jonathan Stearns"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4WO8n7F2XLoh0QNkSNUHcg--~B/aD03ODA7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/6e16432607980df8a30d67a1df49d64f", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
