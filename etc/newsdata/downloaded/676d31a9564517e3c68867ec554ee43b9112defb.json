And I have tried, during this period, to find a way out, through which to listen to the voice of the people.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Hariri announces his resignation in a televised address\n\nBut he added: \"It has become necessary for us to make a great shock to fix the crisis.\"\n\nCamps destroyed\n\nThe demonstrations have reflected the schisms within Lebanese society and have led to a 10-day closure of banks, with many other offices, schools and universities also shut.\n\nThe militant Shia group, Hezbollah, which has dominated Mr Hariri's coalition government, has recently hardened its stance against the protests.\n\nOn Tuesday, black-clad men loyal to Hezbollah and another Shia group, Amal, destroyed a protest camp in central Beirut, chanting slogans, setting tents on fire and beating anti-government demonstrators. A roadblock set up by protesters was also attacked.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Protesters formed a human chain 170km (105 miles) long on Sunday\n\nRiot police and troops have tried to separate the rival groups, firing tear gas.\n\nHezbollah had argued against Mr Hariri's resignation, saying it could result in a void in Lebanese government.\n\nHezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has suggested the protests are funded by foreign powers and last Friday said \"someone is trying to pull [Lebanon]... towards a civil war\".\n\nMr Hariri and his coalition administration, including Hezbollah, had earlier agreed to a plan of reforms to try to placate protesters, but their campaign has continued.\n\nThe BBC's Martin Patience says many in the population are tired of economic stagnation, endemic corruption and a lack of basic public services.\n\nHe adds that the developments will alarm the West, which regards Lebanon as an island of relative stability in a turbulent Middle East.\n\nA power-sharing agreement that ended the country's civil war 30 years ago has kept the peace, but it has failed to halt the slide towards economic crisis.", "description": "Saad Hariri says the country needs a shock to end its deadlock, after a wave of demonstrations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4EED/production/_109450202_mediaitem109450199.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
