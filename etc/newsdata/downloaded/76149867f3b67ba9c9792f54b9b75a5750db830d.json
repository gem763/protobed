His Facebook page said he \u201cpassed away peacefully\u201d on Sunday morning.\n\nBaker was born in 1939 in Lewisham, south London, and grew up amid the blitz; his father was killed in action in 1943. He began drumming in his mid-teens, remembering in 2009: \u201cI\u2019d never sat behind a kit before, but I sat down \u2013 and I could play! One of the musicians turned round and said, \u2018Bloody hell, we\u2019ve got a drummer\u2019, and I thought, \u2018Bloody hell, I\u2019m a drummer!\u2019\u201d\n\nEarly work came with the jazz guitarist Diz Disley \u2013 which ended when an 18-year-old Baker set fire to a hotel while on tour in Europe \u2013 and with bandleader Terry Lightfoot. He played blues in Blues Incorporated \u2013 including guest appearances with an early incarnation of the Rolling Stones \u2013 and US R&B with the Graham Bond Organisation, both alongside Jack Bruce on bass guitar.\n\nDespite considerable friction between Baker and Bruce, the pair in 1966 formed Cream with Eric Clapton, who had previously played with the Yardbirds and John Mayall. Cream helped define the psychedelic rock sound of the decade, with Baker bringing both a jazz sensibility \u2013 Toad, from debut album Fresh Cream, features one of the first ever drum solos in rock \u2013 and a hard-hitting style, using two bass drums, that pointed towards heavy metal.\n\nCream sold more than 15m records worldwide and had hits including Sunshine of Your Love, Strange Brew and White Room; three of their four albums reached both the US and UK top five.\n\nThe band split in 1968, releasing a final album in 1969. A reunion in 2005 ended in animosity, with Baker and Bruce shouting at each other on stage in New York. In 1969, Baker and Clapton formed the short-lived band Blind Faith with Steve Winwood and Ric Grech, and the latter pair joined Baker in his next project, jazz-rock band Ginger Baker\u2019s Air Force.\n\nBaker moved to Nigeria in 1971 and set up the Batakota recording studio in Lagos, which hosted local musicians as well as established stars (Wings recorded part of Band on the Run there). He performed with Nigerian star Fela Kuti \u2013 \u201che understands the African beat more than any other westerner,\u201d said Kuti\u2019s drummer Tony Allen \u2013 and went on to collaborate or perform with a hugely varied array of musicians: Public Image Ltd, Hawkwind, hard rock band Baker-Gurvitz Army, and jazz performers Max Roach, Art Blakey and Elvin Jones. In 1994, he formed a jazz trio with Charlie Haden and Bill Frisell.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ginger Baker pictured in 2008.

In 2008, when living in South Africa, he was defrauded of more than \u00a330,000 by a bank clerk he had hired as a personal assistant. He also suffered from various health issues, including respiratory illness and osteoarthritis, and underwent open heart surgery in 2016. \u201cGod is punishing me for my past wickedness by keeping me alive and in as much pain as he can,\u201d he said in 2009.\n\nThat wickedness perhaps included his notorious temper \u2013 \u201cI used to be mean \u2013 I\u2019d deliberately mess up recording sessions with my temper and go mad at the slightest thing,\u201d he said in 1970. He was married four times \u2013 \u201cIf a plane went down and there was one survivor, it would be Ginger. The devil takes care of his own,\u201d first wife Elizabeth Ann Baker said in 2009 \u2013 and used heroin on and off since the mid-60s: he told the Guardian in 2013 that he relapsed \u201csomething like 29 times\u201d.\n\nA documentary, Beware of Mr Baker, was made about his life in 2012. He is survived by his three children, Kofi, Leda and Ginette.", "description": "Drummer who straddled jazz, blues and rock \u2018passed away peacefully\u2019", "authors": ["Ben Beaumont-Thomas"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/863723ce40eb3fdefaff19986f39ee444f30ecc2/1317_744_3967_2380/master/3967.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=09f6a26f1b20583a8629d2357e051888", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
