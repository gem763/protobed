It\u2019s a riot of bureaucratic slapstick, pompous posturing, regulatory pretentiousness, corporate schemers and botched financial planning: a true comedy.\n\nOpening scene:\n\nA character played by Bill Murray, an old pro operator of flame-thrower equipment, arrives at a suburban Toronto warehouse to perform his Potbuster duties. Wearing heavy gear with the words \u201cHealth Canada\u201d written across the back, he looks through grizzled, experienced eyes at a 12,000-kilogram mound of cannabis. There\u2019s something you don\u2019t see every day. Gotta be worth a hundred million at least,\u201d he says.\n\nBeside him, also in Health Canada gear, is another old pro Potbuster played by Dan Aykroyd: \u201cOh my God. This is a harmless mound of pot. Something I\u2019ve loved since my childhood. Something that could never possibly destroy us. We used to smoke it by the fire at Camp Oconda.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what. We got a job to do \u2014 one, two, three.\u201d The characters crouch down and blast flames at the cannabis, which explodes in yellow blaze and pungent smoke. The Aykroyd character breaks down, almost in tears. \u201cHow did we come to this?\u201d\n\nSomebody else can finish the script, but it\u2019s a good question.\n\nThe scene describes the latest wonky development in Canada\u2019s absurd one-year-old cannabis legalization experiment \u2014 the very first policy initiative of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s newly elected Liberal government in 2015.\n\nSince then, hundreds of millions of dollar have been splashed around the country by investors looking to make quick dollars by manufacturing and distributing a product that already had a functioning, low-cost market system in place. Some call it the black market, but the existing market was in fact the closest perfect example of a free market \u2014 a low-cost, high-quality product \u2014 without the benefit of stock brokers, securities regulators, scheming politicians and corporate wheeler-dealers attempting to capitalize on government regulation.\n\nIt turned out one of those companies, CannTrust Holdings Inc., had been secretly growing cannabis products in unlicensed portions of its Ontario facilities, without proper approval from Health Canada. The department moved in, seized the products involved, and has ordered their destruction. How? Who ya gonna call? Potbusters.\n\nHow did we arrive at a point where a legal corporation finds itself in the clink for doing what thousands of people have been doing illegally and mostly freely for decades?\n\nHere\u2019s another funny scene set-up for this regulatory/corporate comedy: The offices of Statistics Canada in Ottawa, where the nation\u2019s crack statistics bureaucrats set up a team to plumb the data depths of the national cannabis market. They called it the Cannabis Stats Hub, which produced StatsCannabis data. Look it up if you think I\u2019m kidding.\n\nSince establishing the Cannabis Stats Hub about five years ago, the agency has been cranking out hilarious reports and studies, with such titles such as \u201cExperimental Estimates of Cannabis Consumption in Canada, 1960 to 2015,\u201d \u201cCrowdsourced cannabis prices,\u201d and \u201cA Cannabis Economic Account \u2014 The Framework.\u201d\n\nThe StatsCan cannabis hub produced some of the data that fuelled last year\u2019s mad hype around legalization. In fancy reports, the hub estimated the annual consumption of cannabis at more than 700 tonnes and the dollar value of black market sales at $5.7 billion in 2017.\n\nThe fine print was funny, though. Regarding the 700 tonnes, the report warned that there were numerous uncertainties. \u201cCumulatively, the uncertainty about the volume estimate is sufficiently large that it could reasonably be reduced by about 54 per cent or increased by about 95 per cent.\u201d The 700 tonnes, in other words, could actually be less than 350 tonnes.\n\nAs for the price and value, collected via crowdsourcing methods, StatsCan estimated that 4.9 million Canadians spent $5.7 billion on cannabis for medical and non-medical purposes. The dollar value of cannabis production in 2017 was bigger than beer and tobacco production, it said. Data allegedly showed that the age of pot consumers was getting older, consumption was rising and \u2014 best of all \u2014 prices were falling. A note to readers of the report warned that the data was based on a lot of assumptions and might not be all that reliable. More recently, StatsCan reported that its price information is now collected by \u201cscraping the websites of illegal online retailers. Since the prices collected through web scraping include only illegal online purchases of cannabis, they are not fully comparable with the StatsCannabis data which include both online and other purchases of illegal cannabis.\u201d\n\nFree-market cannabis prices are apparently now down to around $7 a gram and lower.\n\nThe funny bit here is that Canada\u2019s official statistics agency has been busy building up data on an industry that has been unregulated and illegal for decades, mainly to allow governments and scheming corporations to seize control of a market that to all intents and purposes has been wildly successful.\n\nBy all accounts, the previously existing free market in cannabis still delivers the best outcome: low prices, high quality, and ease of purchase. As reported recently in the Financial Post, unregulated market sellers are set up all over the country ready to serve consumers.\n\nThe logical conclusion: In an ideal world, Canada should have simply declared cannabis legal. End of plan. Let the current players get legal. Instead, state planners aimed to subvert the free market and install a modern regulated corporatist model that drove up prices, failed on quality and stumbled setting up retail systems.\n\nAnd now \u2014 hilariously \u2014 the cannabis establishment wants to clamp down on the free market, which it conveniently brands as the black market.\n\nCould we start again? Send in Potbusters to take down the lawyers, bureaucrats, corporate dealers, securities regulators and tax collectors. Let the old free market run the cannabis industry.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: tcorcoran@nationalpost.com | Twitter: terencecorcoran", "description": "The previously existing free market in cannabis still delivers the best outcome: low prices, high quality, and ease of purchase", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/canntrust-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
