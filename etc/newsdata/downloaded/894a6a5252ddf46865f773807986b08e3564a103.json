Smith missed two games last season with a neck issue as the injuries have piled up on him in recent years. The 28-year-old, who also has battled back issues, hasn\u2019t played a full season since 2015.\n\nSmith was the only player who didn\u2019t practice all week among several Cowboys trying to return from injuries. Four are listed as questionable: right tackle La\u2019el Collins, receiver Michael Gallup and defensive linemen Tyrone Crawford and Antwaun Woods.\n\nCollins was limited in practice Friday after missing two days with a back problem that cropped up this week. Gallup could return after missing two weeks following arthroscopic knee surgery. He was the team\u2019s leading receiver when he was injured in Week 2 at Washington.\n\nCrawford said he was expecting to return against the Packers after missing two weeks with a hip injury that he also dealt with in the offseason. Woods injured a knee against the Redskins.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dallas left tackle Tyron Smith has been ruled out of the Cowboys' game Sunday against Green Bay after spraining an ankle last week against New Orleans.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
