Not today. Two major players in recent news will be out to face this music this morning, starting with Mick Mulvaney. He\u2019ll drop by \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d to try to clean up the rhetorical turd he left on the carpet on Thursday when he admitted that military aid for Ukraine had been held back to pressure them to investigate the CrowdStrike matter. Chris Wallace, now the undisputed face of \u201chard news\u201d at Fox with Shepard Smith\u2019s departure, will press him on why we shouldn\u2019t believe that Trump also had the Biden/Burisma matter in mind as part of the quid pro quo. And why Mulvaney put out that goofy statement after Thursday\u2019s press conference insisting that he never said what he plainly said hours earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, Mike Pompeo will sit down with \u201cThis Week\u201d fresh off his trip to Turkey with Mike Pence to discuss the notably Erdogan-friendly ceasefire agreement the two negotiated. According to the Times, Pompeo has been happy to let Pence take the blame \u2014 I mean \u201ccredit\u201d \u2014 for the outcome:\n\nThe reality was that the agreement gave Mr. Erdogan everything he had hoped for \u2014 he gained territory and avoided sanctions \u2014 and it looked like a complete cave-in by the United States. And Mr. Pence was the impassive, uncomfortable face of a losing deal\u2026 One possible clue that an association with the agreement might not be a winner, especially for a Republican, came from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who arrived in Ankara on a separate plane from Mr. Pence, and made it clear he was there strictly in a support role to back up the vice president. (His trip also extended to Jerusalem and Brussels, and his plane departed before Mr. Pence\u2019s.)\n\nHe\u2019ll chat with George Stephanopoulos about what happens if the Kurds haven\u2019t evacuated the Syrian border region per Erdogan\u2019s demands once the ceasefire expires on Tuesday. And of course he\u2019ll be challenged on why Rudy Giuliani and Rick Perry, not Pompeo\u2019s own State Department, were apparently in charge of negotiating with Ukraine about the \u201ccorruption\u201d investigations the president was interested in.\n\nIf none of that grabs you, Pete Buttigieg will appear on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d \u201cState of the Union,\u201d and \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d to show off his new brand as a center-leftist just in time for the decline phase of Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy. And two right-wing congressmen who\u2019ve broken with the GOP in different ways will turn up to discuss their issues with Trump. It\u2019ll be Republican-turned-independent Justin Amash on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and retiring Republican Will Hurd on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Both will be asked about Syria and impeachment, of course, as well as the spectacle of Trump attempting to award the contract to host the G7 to his own Florida resort. Frankly, that line of questioning from Wallace may be harder for Mulvaney to answer than the \u201cquid pro quo\u201d stuff is. The full line-up is at the AP.", "description": "Quid pro quo?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mm-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
