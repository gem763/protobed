My sister was a huge fan of is growing up. There are rumors that she cried when the closing song was sung, and the credits rolled. I cannot confirm, but people are saying that. I was a Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood fan myself, but as with anything\u2014times change. And there is a huge change coming for the Sesame Street universe. No, it\u2019s not being canceled, but the introduction of its latest character is sure to raise some eyebrows. The Sesame Workshop is taking on the opioid crisis. The green-colored Karli, who was introduced earlier this year, is set to reveal why her character was in foster care; her mother is an addict. Why even go here? Isn\u2019t this a bit dark for kids? Yes, it is dark, but with millions of kids under the age of 11 living with at least one parent battling addiction, it was time to address it (via The Guardian):\n\nSesame Workshop is exploring the backstory of Karli, a bright green, yellow-haired friend of Elmo\u2019s whose mother is battling addiction.\n\nSesame Street creators said they turned to the issue of addiction since data shows 5.7m children under the age of 11 live in households with a parent with substance use disorder. America\u2019s opioid crisis has grown steadily worse in recent years. The Department of Health and Human Services reported 10.3 million people misused opioid prescriptions last year, and an average of 130 people die every day from opioid-related drug overdoses.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else out there that addresses substance abuse for young, young kids from their perspective,\u201d said Kama Einhorn, a senior content manager with Sesame Workshop. It\u2019s also a chance to model to adults a way to explain what they\u2019re going through to kids and to offer simple strategies to cope.\n\n\u201cEven a parent at their most vulnerable \u2013 at the worst of their struggle \u2013 can take one thing away when they watch it with their kids, then that serves the purpose,\u201d Einhorn said.\n\nThe initiative is part of Sesame Street in Communities resources, which offer online child activities and assistance to parents.\n\nThis summer in Manhattan, puppeteers, producers and show creators crammed into a small studio in the not-for-profit organization\u2019s Manhattan headquarters to tape some of the upcoming segments on addiction.\n\nKarli, voiced and manipulated by the puppeteer Haley Jenkins, was joined by a young girl whose parents are in recovery.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nKarli had already been introduced as a puppet in foster care earlier this year but viewers now will understand why her mother had to go away for a while.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe online-only segments with Karli and Salia are augmented with ones that feature Elmo\u2019s dad, Louie, explaining that addiction is a sickness, and Karli telling Elmo and Chris about her mom\u2019s special adult meetings and her own kids\u2019 ones.", "description": ".10/16/2019 16:43:23PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Bronson Stocking", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/13/28eb09a4-5c5d-4b74-b56b-eb7b558a08c5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
