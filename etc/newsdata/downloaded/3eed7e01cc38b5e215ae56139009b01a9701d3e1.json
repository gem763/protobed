Posters in the capital,Tunis, on Sept. 7.\n\nTUNIS\u2014When the people of Tunisia took to the streets in 2011, their protests set off the Arab Spring, fanning years of rebellion and war across the Middle East. Tunisia was the only country to emerge from that tumult as a democracy.\n\nToday, as new democratic movements gather strength elsewhere in North Africa and Tunisia prepares for a presidential election on Sunday, the country\u2019s role as a showcase for democracy in the volatile region is being tested.\n\nThe death in July of the country\u2019s 95-year-old president, who was expected to step down in November, accelerated plans for the election, the country\u2019s second since the uprising that toppled former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011.\n\nThe race has been beset by controversy and surprises. The apparent front-runner, a media mogul, was jailed in August in a disputed tax-evasion case but remains on the ballot. The late president\u2019s conservative party has splintered in a rivalry among its former leaders, while the country\u2019s leading moderate Islamist party put forward a nominee for the first time. Two dozen candidates are contesting the wide-open race, including remnants of the old autocratic regime and Tunisia\u2019s first openly gay candidate.\n\nPresidential candidate Abdel-Fattah Mourou, a moderate Islamist lawyer, meeting with supporters in Tunis, on Sept. 9.

In Egypt the military seized power, reverting the country to autocracy. This year, though, protest movements breathed new life into hopes for democracy across the region after the fall of autocrats Omar Bashir in Sudan and Abdelaziz Bouteflika in Algeria.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of tumult,\u201d said Dan Twining, president of the International Republican Institute, an American nongovernmental group that is observing the Tunisian vote. \u201cCitizens are highly dissatisfied and disaffected by dictatorial rule.\u201d\n\nMany credit Tunisia\u2019s success to a spirit of compromise by the country\u2019s disparate political factions, which struck a pact in 2013 to avoid Egypt\u2019s fate. The country also established a truth commission that shed light on past government abuses. The deceased president, Beji Caid Essebsi, guided Tunisia\u2019s transition to democracy despite having been a senior official in the old regime, pursuing legal reforms and bringing his party into a governing coalition with an Islamist party.\n\nMr. Essebsi didn\u2019t leave a successor in place, and since his death several candidates are competing to claim the secular conservative constituency he represented, among them Prime Minister Youssef Chahed and Defense Minister Abdelkarim Zbidi.\n\nThe moderate Islamist party he worked with, Ennahda, nominated Mr. Mourou, after having previously avoided the presidency out of concern over the pressures an Islamist government would face. His candidacy is a reminder of how Tunisia managed to avoid the fate of Egypt, which elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2012 and then saw its brief experiment with democracy end in a military coup.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to deepen democratic institutions,\u201d Mr. Mourou said in an interview.\n\nThe first round of the election will be held Sept. 15, with a runoff expected in the following weeks if no candidate wins an outright majority.\n\nEconomic issues have played large in the election amid growing disaffection among the Tunisian public, especially the country\u2019s youth, who face an estimated unemployment rate of 35%.\n\nThe economy is growing at a sluggish 1.2%, still struggling to recover from a series of terrorist attacks that devastated Tunisia\u2019s tourist industry. Budget cuts and a $2.9 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund have eroded living standards and failed to draw enough foreign investment to spur growth.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see anyone I can trust in the candidates,\u201d said Khalil Jegham, a 21-year-old biology student.\n\nPrime Minister Youssef Chahed, a member of the deceased president\u2019s party, is vying with other party rivals for the presidency.

Mr. Riahi, who was convicted of corruption charges and lives in France, beamed a hologram of himself into one of his campaign events in August.\n\nThe front-runner in polls is Nabil Karoui, the owner of a major television channel and other media ventures, who has built support among the poor through handouts of food and promises to restart Tunisia\u2019s economy.\n\nPolice arrested Mr. Karoui on Aug. 23, throwing the campaign into chaos and leading to concerns about bias in the country\u2019s judicial institutions and the election\u2019s integrity. However, the election commission has ruled that he is still allowed to stand in the election while the tax case continues.\n\nMr. Karoui was charged with tax evasion after investigations by an anticorruption nonprofit showed that he was paying relatively little in taxes on his media and advertising empire. His campaign says he is innocent and has accused the government of using the tax case to try to sideline him from the election.\n\nSupporters of jailed presidential candidate Nabil Karoui rally in front of a tribunal in Tunis to ask for his release from prison.

He spent months touring poor, neglected areas of Tunisia, handing out food and offering services like free surgeries through a charity organization he runs.\n\nA Karoui campaign official welcomed comparisons between his candidate and President Trump, citing Mr. Karoui\u2019s plans to restart the economy by easing government restrictions on private businesses. \u201cWe\u2019re going to kill the old system,\u201d said Samy Achour, a member of Mr. Karoui\u2019s campaign, outlining plans to change Tunisia\u2019s economy.\n\nOpponents view Mr. Karoui as an aspiring strongman, citing leaked recordings in which he threatened to blackmail anticorruption activists. The candidate has said the recordings were misleadingly edited.\n\nMany Tunisians and close observers worry that the fiercely contested election points to the need to advance the country\u2019s democratic project, including overhauls to the security institutions of the old regime that remain susceptible to autocratic politicians.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you hope to see coming out of Tunisia\u2019s presidential elections?
