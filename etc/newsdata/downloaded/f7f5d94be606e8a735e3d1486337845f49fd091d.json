You can form your own view.

(Not least because numerous studies show that if you improve the financial education of a child in a household, the entire family gains vital skills by osmosis.)\n\nThe problem is that only 6 per cent of parents learned about money in school. While most were taught by parents or other family members, a fifth of today\u2019s parents said nobody ever taught them money lessons \u2013 they had to work it out for themselves.\n\nSo if you already feel like you\u2019re on shaky foundations, here\u2019s how to start teaching your kids about money this summer.\n\nGetting the ball rolling\n\nCrucially, if there are two parents at home, teaching should be a joint task. Single parents could rope in the support of a friend or family member willing to help guide children through real-life scenarios. That way children don\u2019t grow up thinking budgeting, financial planning and other money affairs are the job of one parent or the other. Everyone is responsible for their money.\n\nStart young\n\nChildren begin learning about the value of things very early, progressing to monetary value far sooner than many family members realise. And if they\u2019re not learning financial skills from their parents, they\u2019re learning from adverts and peer pressure.\n\nBetween the ages of four and six, just over a quarter of parents say their children are spenders, and just under a third say they\u2019re savers, but as they go through their childhood, the temptation to spend grows, so that by the age of 16-17, 37 per cent say they\u2019re spenders.\n\nIt\u2019s therefore important to start talking to your children and letting them make decisions about money, even before they start primary school.\n\nGet them to prioritise\n\n\u201cSensible spending and saving comes down to our ability to prioritise, and the best way to give children a chance to develop these skills is through pocket money,\u201d says Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\n\u201cWe found 62 per cent of parents said they give their kids pocket money \u2013 at an average of \u00a37.50 a week. Not only does it encourage them to learn how to spend on the most important things \u2013 and the perils of spending without planning, but it also stops them pestering you to buy treats at every turn.\n\n\u201cAs they get older, you can give them an allowance instead, to cover costs like their mobile, new clothes and going out. By gradually increasing the scope of their spending decisions, you\u2019re effectively preparing them for the day they have to balance their budget alone.\u201d\n\nGive them a stake\n\nThe most effective way to bring money lessons alive is to give them a stake. The good news is that most parents already do this: our survey showed that 68 per cent of them save for their children, and on average they put away \u00a355.30 a month.\n\n\u201cSome 57 per cent give their children hands-on experience with this money by putting it in a savings account in the child\u2019s name,\u201d adds Coles.\n\n\u201cAnother common approach is to save in your own name for the benefit of children \u2013 25 per cent put money into savings for their kids and 4 per cent use their own ISA allowance. While this is a useful way to keep control of some of the money you put aside for children, it\u2019s vital that this is alongside savings they can manage themselves.\u201d\n\nMore details, specific lesson ideas and general guidance around teaching kids about money can be found here.", "description": "Debt crises, financial crime, old age poverty, losing a home, even the impact of the odd fallen star fund managers.\u00a0 These problems and many more besides are all too often met with the same horrified moan by those facing severe restrictions to their lives today and their hopes for the future: \u201cI didn\u2019t realise.
