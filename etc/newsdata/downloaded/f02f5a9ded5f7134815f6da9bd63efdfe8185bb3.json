The very notion of sight is a dangerous myth \u2014 until the birth of twins who can see. Momoa plays Baba Voss, the leader of a tribe searching for a new home.\n\nThe series lands on an interesting premise, one in which humans have basically reverted back to their more primal instincts after generations of not being able to see. But they are still innovative and have adapted with new ways of reading and traveling.\n\nStill, right from the start, I wondered whether the past of this world might have made a better TV show than the present.\n\nNevertheless, the story we do get is an imperfect but entertaining and strange fantasy series. There's little character development in the first two episodes I watched, but enough world building to leave me intrigued. It's no \"Game of Thrones,\" but that's too high a bar to judge its success or failure.\n\n\"See\" takes some surprising narrative risks with time that make sure the plot doesn't get bogged down and the show wastes no time in getting to the heart of its story.\n\nBeyond its storyline, \"See\" is just beautiful to watch. Apple is spending $240 million on two seasons, according to The Hollywood Reporter, and it shows.\n\nIs the show good enough to justify that budget, or Apple TV Plus itself?\n\nIt's too early to tell, but the success of \"See\" will be central to Apple TV Plus' launch, especially with the negative reviews flowing in for its other flagship series, \"The Morning Show.\"", "description": "Apple TV Plus' \"See,\" starring Jason Momoa, takes place hundreds of years in a future when the world's remaining humans are blind.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db6fed2dee019552f735462?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
