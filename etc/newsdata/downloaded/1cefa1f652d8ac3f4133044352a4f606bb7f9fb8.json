We urge the UK\u2019s governments to act on those recommendations to support voter confidence.\n\n\u201cSignificant sums were spent on campaigning at the 2016 EU referendum and it is vital that voters have transparency over the way these campaigns were funded. It is therefore right that suspected offences are investigated by the appropriate authorities, as the NCA has done in this case.\u201d\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage said: \"I am pleased that the NCA have cleared Arron Banks. The appalling establishment campaign against Mr Banks must now end. Heads must roll - beginning with the Electoral Commission who, without evidence, suggested that criminal offences may have been committed.
