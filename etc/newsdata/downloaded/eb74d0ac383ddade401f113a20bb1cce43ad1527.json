AWS revenues from UK government contracts grew by more than 50pc last year, the leaked figures suggest.\n\nSuch is the pace of the growth that some critics claim that the UK Government\u2019s reliance on AWS poses a systemic risk, should AWS servers crash.\n\nLast year, a Lloyd\u2019s of London report estimated that even a temporary shutdown at a major cloud provider like AWS could wreak almost $20bn in business losses.\n\nThere are also questions about Amazon\u2019s tax status. AWS recently created a Luxembourg-based subsidiary whose accounts for 2018 show it paid just \u20ac10m (\u00a38.6m) tax on \u20ac1.9bn revenues. In the same year, HMRC business to AWS was worth \u00a315m.", "description": "The web giant Amazon has cornered more than a third of the lucrative UK market in storing and processing government-held information, including sensitive biometric details and tax records, figures leaked to The Sunday Telegraph suggest.", "authors": ["Harry De Quetteville", "Tom Hoggins"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/10/18/cloud-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
