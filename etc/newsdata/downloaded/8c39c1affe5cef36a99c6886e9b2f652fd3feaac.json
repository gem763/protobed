Imports of cell phones were up 13.3% in August from July.\n\nExports were up 0.2%, driven by a 3.4% increase in exports of capital goods, particularly fuel oil. Automobile exports also rose 2.7% to $14.28 billion, the highest level since July 2014.\n\nFriday's report offered some reassurance about Americans' willingness to spend despite weaker global growth and uncertainty around the trade war between the U.S. and China.\n\nIt also highlights once again the diverging economic outlooks between U.S. households and businesses, particularly manufacturers. Household spending remains relatively strong. It grew 2.3% in August over the previous year after adjusting for inflation, the Commerce Department reported in September.\n\nFactories, on the other hand, are struggling.\n\nAn index of new orders for manufacturing exports have been contracting for three months and in September hit the lowest level since March 2009, according to the Institute for Supply Management.\n\nOverall factory activity also fell for the second straight month, the group said, which has led U.S. firms to cut back on orders from overseas suppliers.\n\nSimilar surveys in Europe and Asia released earlier this week also pointed to a manufacturing slowdown largely due to shrinking exports.\n\nThe bleak global trade picture could persist through the end of the year. On Tuesday, the World Trade Organization said it expected international trade in goods to grow by just 1.2% this year, the lowest annual increase since 2009.\n\nMuch of that grim outlook is due to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. The Trump administration has imposed a series of increasingly steep tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, causing China to retaliate. Talks have so far not produced a comprehensive agreement. The two sides are set to meet again this month.\n\nThe U.S. said Wednesday it would impose tariffs on $7.5 billion in aircraft, food products and other goods from the European Union after the World Trade Organization authorized the levies Wednesday, citing the EU's subsidies to Airbus SE.\n\nThe Commerce Department report on trade can be found at http://www.census.gov/ft900.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 04, 2019 08:45 ET (12:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
