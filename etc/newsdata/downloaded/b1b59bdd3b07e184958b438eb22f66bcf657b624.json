They even got a surprise ending to the night. USA TODAY\n\nPresident Trump's tweet supporting his former press secretary Sean Spicer last week didn't not languish in vain.\n\nLast week on \"Dancing With the Stars,\" Spicer received what appeared to be a dream boost from his old boss. Despite pressing affairs of state, Trump asked his 66 million Twitter followers to vote for \"good guy\" Spicer, who was facing an elimination vote in the fifth week of the dance competition.\n\nHowever, the \"DWTS\" judges decided to cancel the planned elimination after a Disney-themed movie night. Whether it was bad luck or part of the \"DWTS\" Deep State, Trump's golden tweet appeared to be for naught.\n\n'DWTS' drama last week: Disney Night brought princess tears, Hannah Brown as Jasmine\n\nSean Spicer gets Trump support: He's 17 pound light on 'Dancing' and alive in the competition\n\nVote for good guy @seanspicer tonight on Dancing With The Stars. He has always been there for us! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\nBut a \"DWTS\" spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY that the votes tallied from the last week, including those prompted by the president, were combined with votes from Monday's episode.\n\nThe combined votes and judges' scores spared Spicer, who survived despite his waltz with Arnold getting a 21 out of 30 score from the judges. The score was Spicer's best effort, but still at the bottom of the \"DWTS\" board. It was the votes that carried him through.\n\nSpeaking backstage Monday night, Spicer said the Trump tweet was a big factor. \"Yes, it did,\" said Spicer, adding that the president's followers, and their phone votes, play a key role in his success. \"Obviously, there's a lot of folks, part of that movement, who are clearly impressed with how much fun we are having, how hard we're working and how we're progressing.\"\n\nSpicer told USA TODAY that Trump called before tweeting.\n\nSean Spicer dazzles in neon shirt, Sailor Brinkley-Cook fills in for mom on 'DWTS' (Photo: ABC)\n\n\"We were catching up. And he said, 'By the way, you're doing great.' \" Spicer said. \"He had seen some clips. He said, 'I'd love to weigh in and support you.' \"\n\nSpicer would give no further details of the presidential conversation, but said it never veered toward some of Spicer's more outlandish dancing outfits.\n\n\"I never divulge the content of the conversations that I have,\" says said Spicer. \"But we didn't get into my outfits, thank God.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/22/dancing-stars-trumps-sean-spicer-tweet-not-wasted/4067499002/", "description": "President Trump tweeted support for Sean Spicer last week on \"Dancing With the Stars\" and the vote was canceled.
