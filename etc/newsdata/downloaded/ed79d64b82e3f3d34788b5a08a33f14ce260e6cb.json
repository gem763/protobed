Do you just ignore crime or ignore something that's not right?'\n\n'They tell you, 'If you see something, say something. ...Well, if you do that and it costs somebody to lose their life, it makes you not want to do that. And that's sad.'\n\nCommunity members are outraged over Jefferson's sudden death and are calling for action.\n\nPastor Michael Bell of the Greater St. Stephen First Church laid bare his criticisms of the police department statements, according to WFAA reporter Cleo Greene.\n\nJefferson (pictured) received medical treatment from on-site officers, but succumbed to her injuries at the scene\n\nPictured: the press release statement detailing the incident between Jefferson and the officer\n\nBell said in the Twitter video: 'We're tied of police lying.
