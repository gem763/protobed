REUTERS/Chris Wattie/File Photo\n\nWhitfield, who announced his retirement in 2013 after 16 years racing for Canada, unexpectedly won the inaugural Olympic triathlon event at Sydney in 2000 and added a silver eight years later in Beijing.\n\nIn Sydney, Whitfield was in the middle of the field after the swimming and cycling legs but used his sprint speed to pass the leader, German Stephan Vuckovic, less than 300 metres from the finish line before pulling away for the victory.\n\nWhitfield\u2019s triumph is credited with sparking a massive growth in the sport across Canada.\n\nDespatie became the first Canadian man to reach an Olympic podium in diving when he won a silver medal in the individual 3m springboard at the 2004 Athens Games. He repeated the feat four years later in Beijing.\n\nEmilie Heymans, who became the first female diver in the world to win medals at four consecutive Olympics, and Christine Girard, who is Canada\u2019s first ever Olympic weightlifting champion, rounded out the four athlete inductees.\n\nGirard\u2019s bronze medal from the 2008 Beijing Olympics and gold medal from the 2012 London Olympics were awarded several years after the competition when athletes who had initially placed ahead of her were disqualified for doping.\n\nNow a passionate advocate for anti-doping in sport, Girard shares her story and is actively involved in discussions with domestic and international anti-doping advocates.\n\n\u201cThese individuals remind us that the Olympic Movement is about more than just victory,\u201d COC President Tricia Smith said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s about making an indelible impact on our communities, our nation and the next generation.\u201d\n\nThe women\u2019s ice hockey team that conceded just two goals en route to a gold medal at the 2010 Olympics and women\u2019s soccer team that in 2012 won Canada\u2019s first Summer Olympic team sport medal (bronze) since 1936 are also being inducted.\n\nHiroshi Nakamura, who is responsible for the establishment of judo as a competitive sport in Canada and served as head coach at five Olympics is also being inducted.\n\nJack Poole, who played a key role in bringing the Olympic Games to Vancouver in 2010 as chairman of the bid corporation, and Randy Starkman, an award-winning journalist known for his coverage of amateur sports, will both be inducted posthumously.\n\nThe induction ceremony will take place in Toronto on Oct. 23 and individual inductees will be commemorated with murals that will appear in their respective local communities across Canada.", "description": "Former triathlon champion Simon Whitfield and diving standout Alexandre Despatie are among this year's class of nine inductees to the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame, the Canadian Olympic Committee announced on Monday.", "authors": ["Frank Pingue", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433019878&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1K5", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
