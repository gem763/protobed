Wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a sweep of the low around $8.9k to retest the previous range high & low time frame demand at $8.8k where I would favor longs,\u201d he explained.\n\n$BTC 4H Price initially rejected upon first test of the 1W OB/supply zone from early September. 4H bearish div just hit.

Bitcoin CME futures has been very reliable from a TA perspective. The bounce from $7400 was the 200MA on daily as well as the 61.8. We now have a gap, are testing the 61.8, 100MA and the previous support before the breakdown,\u201d he said while referencing the below chart.\n\nHere is a little more logic on my short trade.
