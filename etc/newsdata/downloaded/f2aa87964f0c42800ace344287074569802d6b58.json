The action forces you to turn your body and look back over your shoulder for oncoming traffic, including cyclists. Cyclist Alberto Paulon was killed after being 'doored' in Brunswick (scene pictured) The Dutch Reach aims to reduce 'doorings' where car doors open in the path of oncoming cyclists. The method was introduced in the Netherlands in the 1970s, which is now one of the world\u2019s most cyclist-friendly nations.

The driver was not penalised or charged.\n\nAn unnamed cyclist, who was not wearing a helmet at the time, died from head injuries in May 2014 after he was doored in Highett.\n\nA motorist was later convicted and fined $1200 over the incident.\n\nItalian chef, Alberto Paulon, 25, was riding to work when he ricocheted off an open car door and under the wheels of a truck in Brunswick in March 2015.\n\nThe female driver was fined for illegally opening a car door into the path of an oncoming vehicle and was later ordered by the court to pay $1000.\n\nMr Cross' death in 2010 promoted the Victorian government to double the on-the-spot fine for doorings to $352 and and increase the court-imposed penalty from $423 to $1,408.\n\nThe death of James Cross (pictured) in 2010 promoted the Victorian government to act\n\nFord's Driving Skills For Life initiative is a free program is targeted at young drivers\n\nBut that's not enough for Bicycle Network, which has called for on-the-spot and court penalties to be be doubled.\n\n'Police have previously failed to penalise infringements and infringement penalties in most state and territories are too low,' Bicycle Network website states.\n\nThe Dutch Reach is one of skills emphasised by Ford in this year's Driving Skills For Life program recently launched in Melbourne in an effort to reduce injuries from doorings.\n\nNow in its fifth year, Ford's free DSFS initiative aims to educate as many young drivers as possible to reduce the road toll as it continues to rise every year.\n\nEight cyclists have been killed so far this year in Victoria alone this year, already double than last year's road toll.\n\nThe 2019 NSW road toll currently stands at 11, up from eight cyclists killed last year.\n\nThe program also aims to give insight into skills not normally taught by driving instructors.\n\n'This year's program has a lot more focus on young drivers to be aware of their surroundings when sharing the road with cyclists,' Ford chief executive Kay Hart told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'Any loss of life demonstrates why the program is needed. Drivers need to be aware they share the road with everyone.'\n\nThe new research commissioned by Ford also found than half (53 per cent) of drivers surveyed admitted they're not confident sharing the road with cyclists while 68 per cent of cyclists are concerned every time a vehicle passes them while on the road.\n\nAlberto Paulon, 25 (left) was riding to work in Melbourne when he was fatally doored in 2015\n\nAlmost one third of drivers also admitted they didn't know the 'one metre' distance rule between their vehicle and cyclists when travelling at 60 km/h.\n\nEven more disturbing is that only half of drivers surveyed obey the one-metre rule, which is only a guideline in Victoria.\n\nThe one-metre rule is legislation in every other Australian state and territory.\n\nThe driver was not penalised or charged over the death of James Cross (pictured) in 2010\n\nDSFL driving instructor James Stewart wants to change drivers' attitudes towards cyclists.\n\n'There's no love or courtesy on the roads anymore,' he said.\n\n'That's scary as driving is the most dangerous thing most people will do in their life every day. My advice to drivers is treat cyclists like a member of their family. They're human beings, just like the rest of us.'\n\nThis is the second years the DSFL program has been held in partnership with the Amy Gillett Foundation.\n\nThe foundation began in 2005 after the death of Amy Gillett, who was killed by a motorist while training with the Australian women's cycling team in Germany.\n\nDonning distorting goggles while a wearing 'drunk suit' (pictured) shows young drivers how difficult it is to walk a straight line after several standard drinks\n\nParticipants also get practical experience on how to brake in slippery conditions\n\nA former world champion junior rower, Gillett was ranked in the world top 100 in road cycling at the time.\n\nOne in five people injured on the road is a cyclist, a statistic Amy Gillett Foundation acting chief executive Marilyn Johnson wants to change.\n\n'The research revealed a lot of gaps when it comes to young drivers sharing the road with cyclists,' she told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'The message we want to get across is to look out for cyclists and give them room. We need to take better care of each other on the roads.'\n\nParticipants also get a real-world experience of slamming on the brakes at 60km/h to get a feel for the ABS brakes kicking in.\n\n'The brakes are your friend,' Mr Stewart says.\n\nFord's free program targeted at young drivers was recently launched in Melbourne\n\nParticipants also do a virtual simulation exercise in the eyes of a cyclist on busy roads\n\nProgram participants also take part in a virtual simulation of riding London streets as a cyclist.\n\nThey also get to wear a 'drunk suit' which mimics the effects of having alcohol in their system.\n\nStudents are strapped with weights and wear distorting goggles to get an eye opening insight just how basic motor skills are affected after several standard drinks.\n\nThe DSFL program was held in Melbourne and Geelong in recent weeks.\n\nIt will be held in Sydney this this year, along with Adelaide, Orange and Newcastle for the first time.\n\nRegistrations: forddsfl.com.au", "description": "Research has found that 95 per cent of Australians are unaware of the 'Dutch Reach', a simple technique which avoids 'dooring' cyclists, emphasised by Ford Driving Skills For Life program", "authors": ["Kylie Stevens For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/27/06/18993126-0-image-a-12_1569560643894.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
