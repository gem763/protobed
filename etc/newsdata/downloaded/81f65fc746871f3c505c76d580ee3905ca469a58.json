The Wall Street Journal previously reported the hiring of AlixPartners.\n\nMcDermott has struggled since the 2014-2016 oil-market collapse saw new orders dry up and a squeeze on cash flow. Its challenges grew with the 2018 acquisition of Chicago Bridge & Iron Co. and a debt burden that\u2019s ballooned to about $4.3 billion, 14 times McDermott\u2019s market value.\n\nEven after the worst of the crude-market collapse receded, the recovery has been too tepid to rejuvenate companies that design, build and provide crews for oil installations and LNG projects. McDermott\u2019s malaise has been particularly acute because it absorbed a slate of Chicago Bridge projects that have been stung by costly labor shortages, construction delays and writedowns.\n\nThe worst crude crash in a generation has taken a toll on the hired hands of the global energy industry. Weatherford International Plc was among the biggest to file for bankruptcy protection when it did so in July. Oilfield contractors in North America especially have been hurt by subdued spending by their exploration customers, who are under pressure from investors to return more profits.\n\nMcDermott \u201chas experienced substantial cost overages on LNG and power projects they inherited through that acquisition, notably the Cameron LNG project\u201d sponsored by Sempra Energy and other partners, Scott Levine, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in an email. Sempra shares dropped as much as 1.9% Wednesday.\n\nThe plunge in shares and bonds comes just weeks after Chief Executive Officer David Dickson warned investors that 2019 will be worse than expected because of delays at some of McDermott\u2019s biggest projects. Earlier this month, the company canceled an appearance at a Barclays conference, citing the need to focus on asset sales and other unspecified priorities.\n\nMcDermott\u2019s $2.23 billion term loan due in 2025, its biggest piece of debt, also plunged, falling by about 17 cents on the dollar to trade at a bid of around 75 cents, a person familiar with the pricing said.\n\nThe company has also brought Evercore Inc. on board to help evaluate strategic options, Debtwire reported earlier.\n\n(Updates prices for shares and bonds in second paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Joe Carroll, Shannon D.
