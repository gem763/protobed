California initially passed the law with the hope of getting the president to release his tax returns so that he would appear on the state\u2019s primary ballot.\n\n\u201cThe Court appreciates the State\u2019s desire for transparency in the political process. Requiring candidates to disclose tax returns could shed light on sources of income, potential conflicts of interest, and charitable tendencies,\u201d England wrote in the ruling, which declared the law unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cIt is not the job of the courts, however, to decide whether a tax return disclosure requirement is good policy or makes political sense,\u201d England continued. \u201cThose are questions delegated to the political branches of the federal government, that is Congress and the President, under Articles I and II of the United States Constitution.\u201d\n\nEngland granted a preliminary injunction on the law last month, temporarily blocking it from going into effect. The Tuesday ruling makes that decision a permanent block. The state plans to appeal the ruling.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the Presidential Tax and Transparency Act into law on July 30. The law required presidential candidates in the California primary to disclose their federal income tax returns for the previous five years as a precondition for appearing on the state ballot. The bill\u2019s author, state Sen. Mike McGuire (D), has said that his legislation was designed to take aim at Trump.\n\nBoth the Trump campaign and the GOP\u2019s lawsuits against Newsom, California Secretary of State Alex Padilla and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said that the law violated candidates\u2019 First Amendment rights to access the ballot.\n\nTrump is the first president in four decades to not release his tax returns, which House Democrats have repeatedly demanded in order to shed light on his financial dealings. All leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have released their tax returns.\n\nNewsom\u2019s office did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. But the governor defended the law in July as a necessary response to the president\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns.\n\n\u201cThese are extraordinary times and states have a legal and moral duty to do everything in their power to ensure leaders seeking the highest offices meet minimal standards, and to restore public confidence,\u201d Newsom said in a statement at the time he signed the law. \u201cThe disclosure required by this bill will shed light on conflicts of interest, self-dealing, or influence from domestic and foreign business interest.\u201d\n\nPadilla, who is also California\u2019s chief elections officer, told the Los Angeles Times that he will appeal the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.\n\n\u201cCalifornia will appeal this ruling and we will continue to make our thorough, thoughtful argument for stronger financial disclosure requirements for presidential and gubernatorial candidates,\u201d Padilla said, according to the L.A. Times. \u201cOur elected leaders have a legal and moral obligation to be transparent with voters about potential conflicts of interest.\u201d", "description": "A federal judge ruled against the new law requiring presidential candidates to release their tax filings to appear on the primary ballot.
