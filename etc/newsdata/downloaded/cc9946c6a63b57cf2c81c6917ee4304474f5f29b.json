As the first digital-native publisher to win a Pulitzer, The Huffington Post \u2014 rebranded as HuffPost in 2017 \u2014 was originally expected to be the crown jewel of Verizon's media properties.\n\nIn 2011, the site surpassed NYTimes.com's traffic numbers, but HuffPost has seen its web traffic decline in recent years. In the six months ended in September, total monthly visits to the site on desktop and mobile dropped 40% from 9.9 million to 5.4 million, per SimilarWeb data. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe development could be the latest instance of Verizon reassessing its digital media assets, which have massively declined in value amid heightened competition. Verizon Media Group was first formed under the name Oath in 2017, when Verizon combined its AOL and Yahoo assets, which it purchased for $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.\n\nThe merger \u2014 which brought together digital media brands like TechCrunch, Engadget, and HuffPost \u2014 was conceived as a potential competitor to Google and Facebook for digital ad dollars. But a year later, Verizon took a $4.6 million writedown on Oath that valued the company at just $200 million, down from $4.8 billion.\n\nDigital media brands like HuffPost have struggled for revenue as Google and Facebook subsume a greater portion of digital advertising budgets. Google, Facebook, and increasingly Amazon dominate the US digital ad market, per eMarketer's Global Digital Ad Spending 2019 report.\n\nTo stay afloat amid dwindling ad revenue, digital media companies have had to cut costs: BuzzFeed, Vice Media, and ThinkProgress have all undergone layoffs this year, totaling 7,200 job cuts in the industry so far, per Business Insider estimates. By comparison, it's estimated about 5,000 were cut between 2014 and 2017.\n\nFor its part, Verizon's Oath writedown was followed by layoffs that hit about 7% of its media operations workforce in January \u2014 about 800 employees, including 20 from HuffPost. Meanwhile, other digital media outlets have been forced to shutter operations, sell themselves at fire-sale prices, or pursue mergers to gain competitive scale that could make them more attractive to advertisers.\n\nTo survive, publishers have had to pursue more creative diversification strategies beyond traditional digital advertising \u2014 and it appears that Verizon may finally be playing ball. Even if Verizon does sell off HuffPost, it's likely to double down on expanding its other existing media assets beyond ad revenue.\n\nLast year, after launching a premium subscription offering for Yahoo Finance, Verizon reportedly considered a subscription tier for HuffPost and Yahoo Sports, though neither materialized. But the company is now reportedly making a concerted push into e-commerce, in particular through shoppable video and native sponsored posts, across its entire portfolio \u2014 including all Yahoo properties, AOL, and Engadget \u2014 to drive incremental growth, per Digiday. Verizon expects that e-commerce could eventually deliver one-third of Verizon Media revenue in the next five years.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
