But when it came to immediately repealing the tariffs Trump has placed on Chinese imports, no candidates raised their hands.\n\nPete Buttigieg began his answer to a U.S.-China trade question by inquiring about Trump\u2019s progress on making a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cIs it just me, or was that supposed to happen in, like, April?\u201d said Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. When asked whether he would repeal tariffs he responded that he \u201cwould have a strategy that would include the tariffs as leverage.\u201d\n\nAhead of next month\u2019s round of trade talks with China, Trump announced on Wednesday that he will postpone a planned tariff increase on about $250 billion in imports from China. The levies were originally scheduled to go into effect on Oct. 1 and were pushed back to Oct. 15.\n\nFriday, China added farm products like soybeans and pork to the list of products it would exempt from tariffs.\n\nNow read: China exempts U.S. agricultural products from tariffs after reports of potential interim trade deal.\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar did not deny that she has supported Trump\u2019s steel tariffs but said the administration has taken matters too far.\n\n\u201cHe has assessed these tariffs on our allies,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has put us in the middle of this trade war and he is treating our farmers and our workers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos.\u201d\n\nAs president she said she would \u201cgo back to the negotiating table,\u201d and would not have put tariffs in place to begin with. She did not say that she would repeal the existing tariffs.\n\nLike Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang said he would not repeal tariffs immediately but vowed to make sure to \u201ccome to a deal that addresses the concerns of American companies and American producers.\u201d\n\nU.S. stocks SPX, -0.03% traded higher on Friday, extending a trend that\u2019s partly due to easing U.S.-China trade tensions.\n\nRead: Dow and S&P 500 drift within reach of records after retail sales report.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidates vowed to roll back several of President Trump\u2019s policies at their Thursday-night debate but held off on immediately...", "authors": ["Elisabeth Buchwald"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR224_dems09_ZG_20190912202506.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
