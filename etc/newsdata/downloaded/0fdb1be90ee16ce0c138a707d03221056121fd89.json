Trump and his administration initially blamed Iran, but on Monday Trump said only \u201cit is looking that way.\u201d\n\nIn honor of the tremendous sway the Saudis apparently have over Trump, Conway marked up the Constitution to read: \u201cThe Saudi Royal Family shall have the power\u201d to declare war.\n\ngosh, I went back to take a look at Art. I, sec. 8, cl. 11 of the Constitution, and it looks like someone recently amended it pic.twitter.com/2IYK00uLqJ \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) September 16, 2019\n\nConway followers \u2014 at least some of them \u2014 loved his latest dig at the president, and couldn\u2019t help notice the similarities to the president\u2019s \u201cSharpie method\u201d of drawing in Alabama earlier this month to a National Weather Service map to support Trump\u2019s flub that the state was in hurricane danger.\n\nExplain to me again why the world's largest oil producer is in bed with the government that aided the 9/11 hijackers? I've never really understood that one and why the Congressional Investigative Committee declined to pursue the leads very well chronicled by the @latimes. \u2014 PF Jacin (@PFJacin) September 16, 2019\n\nPlease don\u2019t give him ideas! \u2014 Ingrid E Baptista (@Ingridebap) September 16, 2019\n\nBut not all of Conway\u2019s 660,000 Twitter followers were so taken by his attack on the president. They were distracted by his silence on the revelation of a new allegation of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nKavanaugh? You\u2019re trying to distract. \u2014 \ud83c\udf3bMolly\ud83c\udf3b (@axlsgirl13) September 16, 2019\n\nKavie lies. You and your family helped install this puppet government and you still don\u2019t want to talk about that \u2014 Mae Burnya (@maeloitering) September 16, 2019\n\nKavanaugh!?!? \u2014 Jodie Moss (@jodiemoss1976) September 16, 2019\n\nYou are still avoiding #KavanaughLied \u2014 PJ McIlvaine (@PJMcIlvaine) September 16, 2019\n\nTell us about Kavanagh, George.
