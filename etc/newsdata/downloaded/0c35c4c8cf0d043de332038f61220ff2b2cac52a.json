Now more than ever, professional athletes are recognizing their power in their respective sports. In the NBA, players like LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard and others have started leveraging star power to land in new locations for themselves and build the type of teams they want around them.\n\nThis realization, naturally, has come last to the players in the NFL, perhaps the stuffiest, most old-money league in the United States. But it has come. When star running back Le\u2019Veon Bell sat out all of 2018 after being franchised-tagged by the Pittsburgh Steelers and still secured the bag this offseason from the New York Jets, it provided a roadmap for players to force their way to new teams and still get paid.\n\nCowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott is the latest in a growing number of NFL stars who are recognizing their value and acting on it. (Getty)\n\nTo avoid dealing with that scenario, both the Kansas City Chiefs and Seattle Seahawks dealt their tagged defensive edge rushers (Dee Ford and Frank Clark) before the draft. The Houston Texans did not, and they paid for it by not getting enough back in their trade of edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney.\n\nYet Clowney cares little about Houston\u2019s pain, and why should he? He\u2019s a winner in this scenario. His trade to Seattle \u2014 and his decision to end his holdout, sign his $15.9 million franchise tender and report for practice this week \u2014 came with a clause that the Seahawks wouldn\u2019t franchise him this offseason. That agreement paves the way for Clowney to hit the jackpot during free agency in March.\n\nGood for him! And good for Elliott, too.\n\nPlayers should exercise their power via holdout to earn as much money possible. NFL careers are short, and no one cries for players when their play dips and teams release them to save money on the salary cap. Players have to, in many cases, earn enough to last for the rest of their lives, and the best way to do that is to leverage their employers for more money while they can.\n\nRest assured, that\u2019s exactly what Elliott and his agent, Rocky Arceneaux, pulled off over the past month. Zeke is now the NFL\u2019s highest-paid running back, and he deserves it. No rusher has been used as much as Elliott since he entered the NFL in 2016, and no running back has been more productive.\n\nProvided the Cowboys are comfortable enough with his off-field behavior \u2014 and apparently they are, considering they capitulated to a new deal \u2014 there\u2019s no doubting his value to the franchise, regardless of the position he plays.\n\nAnd while the recent trend is to say smart teams don\u2019t pay running backs big money, stemming from the belief they\u2019re a dime a dozen and less important than they used to be in today\u2019s pass-happy era, it\u2019s obvious the Cowboys\u2019 chances of winning a Super Bowl are greater with Elliott than without him.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it here.]\n\nMaybe a team takes the risk of trading Zeke and asks its quarterback to pick up the slack if that QB is, say, Aaron Rodgers or Patrick Mahomes, two magicians with the ball in their hands who can beat the perfect defensive call with their arm and elusiveness. But if the quarterback is Dak Prescott \u2014 solid, above-average and steady with some playmaking ability \u2014 and the team is trying to make the Super Bowl \u2026 well, he needs Elliott to hope open up the field.\n\nZeke knew this, and guess what? The Cowboys did, too, which is why they capitulated. Ultimately, Elliott was too valuable to the Cowboys\u2019 Super Bowl hopes to screw around with for too long.\n\n\n\nAnd really, that\u2019s the important thing because the hunch here is that it will continue to be harder for second-tier players to copy this gameplan. Due to the volume of roster spots (53 per team), NFL players are still more replaceable than their counterparts in other sports, meaning teams have less reason to capitulate unless their backs are really against the wall (see: Houston and the Clowney trade).\n\nTeams understand that in a sport where parity reigns supreme \u2014 outside of that improbable dynasty built in New England \u2014 elite players are often the difference in a team\u2019s fate, both during the regular season and playoffs. Because of this, franchises are willing to make exceptions, just like the Cowboys did with Elliott by extending him two years before his contract ran out.\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping more such players continue to recognize their worth \u2014 and cash in in a similar manner \u2014 down the road.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Pro Bowl running back is the latest in a growing number of star players who are recognizing their value and acting on it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xwlSZMYuMtpPOH48wI.xRg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sMqtYeJUa7VDa0ITJzthUQ--~B/aD0yODk5O3c9NDM0OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-01/c50008c0-144a-11e9-97bf-9def157f211b"}
