(Will Newton/Getty Images)\n\nChristian Yelich waited his turn inside the Milwaukee Brewers\u2019 clubhouse late Tuesday night, and only when the moment was right, the reigning National League Most Valuable Player approached a corner locker stall to comfort 22-year-old Trent Grisham. The conversation would stay between them, but whatever was said, it couldn\u2019t immediately suppress the hurt that Grisham was feeling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to sting for a long time,\u201d Grisham said of his eighth-inning blunder in right field, the costly error that led to three runs as the Washington Nationals rallied for a 4-3 win in the National League wild-card game.\n\nGrisham was forced to replay it over and over again afterward. With the bases loaded and his team leading, 3-1, he had charged a base hit by Juan Soto and was looking to keep the tying run from scoring. The ball squirted underneath his glove into right field, and by the time he chased it down, not only did the tying run come in, but so did the go-ahead run.\n\n\u201cI was getting ready to throw to home, and I came in a little off balance. It kind of took a funky little hop on me,\u201d Grisham said.\n\nThe Brewers\u2019 resilient ride to this game, only made more difficult in early September when Yelich was lost for the season with a knee injury, was abruptly over. It was Grisham who replaced Yelich in right field, and one by one, his teammates reminded the rookie of how instrumental he was in their impressive run to the postseason.\n\nThat couldn\u2019t blunt the pain of how Grisham\u2019s rookie season ended, a season which had only begun when he made his major league debut on Aug. 1.\n\n[\u2018Finally caught a break tonight\u2019: Nats take a tortured history and flip the script]\n\n\u201cI just ended up making an error. It\u2019s not going to be my first, and it\u2019s not going to be my last,\u201d said Grisham, a 2015 first-round pick who started the year with the Brewers\u2019 Class AA affiliate in Biloxi, Miss.\n\nHe led off in Yelich\u2019s place in his first postseason game on Tuesday night, finishing with a run and walk in three at-bats, showing the same kind of potential at the plate that had made him a reliable replacement as Milwaukee won 13 of its first 15 games without Yelich to help earn this wild-card berth.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a huge reason we\u2019re even playing in this game. He has a lot to be proud of. He had a great first taste of the big leagues and he\u2019ll be back. He\u2019s going to contribute to our ballclub. I feel for him,\u201d Yelich said of Grisham, who hit .231 with six home runs in 51 games with the Brewers this season.\n\nThe Brewers could point to other factors in their implosion on Tuesday night \u2014 the Brewers left six runners on base and went 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position. All-star left-handed reliever Josh Hader struggled with his command as the eighth inning unraveled. Hader hit pinch-runner Michael A. Taylor, gave up a bloop single to Ryan Zimmerman and loaded the bases by walking Anthony Rendon \u2014 and Soto eventually drove his base hit toward Grisham, who never squared up on the ball and watched it slip underneath him into right field.\n\n\u201cWe win as a team and we lose as a team. Both of those guys [Grisham and Hader] have had so many huge moments for us all season,\u201d Milwaukee left fielder Ryan Braun said. \u201cI think today was a reminder why it\u2019s so important, so significant to win your division, because you play these single elimination games, and these things can happen.\u201d\n\nAfter Grisham had been greeted by most of his teammates, Manager Craig Counsell approached. Counsell had just met with reporters himself, explaining that Grisham was being aggressive on a ball that \u201chad some spin on it.\u201d He eventually walked back to the clubhouse and offered some final words of encouragement to Grisham, who was already staring down a long, painful trip back to Milwaukee and into the offseason.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt,\u201d Grisham said, \u201cand I expect it to hurt.\u201d\n\nRead more Nationals coverage:\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 wild-card win was both thrilling and emotionally exhausting.
