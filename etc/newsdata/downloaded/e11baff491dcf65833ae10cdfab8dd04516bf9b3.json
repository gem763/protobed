(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump paused Friday morning from whatever he is doing to combat his potential impeachment and delivered a surprise spelling lecture to the United States, in a tweet richly layered with mistakes and irony.\n\nAfter a night spent posting Sean Hannity clips and other anti-impeachment commentary onto his timeline, the president emerged on Twitter at 7:02 a.m. and wrote:\n\n\u201cTo show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is, I used the word Liddle\u2019, not Liddle, in discribing Corrupt Congressman Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff. Low ratings @CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!\u201d\n\nJust staring at this pic.twitter.com/WjIjOAzICb \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) September 27, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear exactly what Trump heard on CNN and the network did not immediately respond to questions, but as he explained it, the segment concerned his nickname for House Intelligence chairman Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) \u2014 a leader in Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigations. Trump commonly assigns his political enemies nicknames that sound like 1920s-era cartoon characters \u2014 \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d Biden, \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz,\u201d etc. -- a habit Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan and others have compared to bullying.\n\nFor the Twitter mob that instantly jumped on Trump\u2019s tweet, the low-hanging fruit was his misspelling of \u201cdescribe.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really your stupidity that\u2019s hard to \u2018discribe,\u2019\u201d wrote Trump foil George Conway as \u201cLiddle\u201d shot up Twitter\u2019s list of trending topics.\n\nBut it was the rest of the tweet that truly baffled and transfixed the public. Web searches for \u201chyphen\u201d skyrocketed as people second-guessed whether they (or the president) really knew what a hyphen was. The Merriam-Webster dictionary quickly put out a clarification between a hyphen and an apostrophe.\n\nFor those looking up punctuation early on a Friday morning:\n\n\n\nA hyphen is a mark - used to divide or to compound words.\n\nAn apostrophe is a mark ' used to indicate the omission of letters or figures. \u2014 Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) September 27, 2019\n\nI feel sorry for all the teachers discribing the liddle differences between an apostrophe and a hyphen today. \u2014 David Leavitt (@David_Leavitt) September 27, 2019\n\nEven assuming that Trump mistook the apostrophe in \u201cLiddle\u2019 Adam Schiff,\u201d for a hyphen, it\u2019s still a mystery as to why CNN\u2019s alleged omission of said apostrophe from the moniker would make Trump\u2019s construction any more or less correct. (The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s unclear why Trump has been tagging an apostrophe onto the end of the word in the first place. As Merriam-Webster pointed out, apostrophes typically mark where characters have been taken out of a word \u2014 as in \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to the store,\u201d or \u201cLi\u2019l Abner,\u201d or \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nLiddle\u2019 is missing no letters; it\u2019s just a weird spelling of \u201clittle\u201d with a superfluous mark at the end.\n\nI don\u2019t know who needs to read this but: \u201cLi\u2019l.\u201d \u2014 A.R.

He forgot to use actual hyphens in \u201cLow ratings CNN\u201d and \u201cnever ending situation,\u201d for example, and wrote \u201cpurposely\u201d when he probably meant \u201cpurposefully,\u201d (a mixup Merriam-Webster has taken him to task for before.)\n\nThe president has a long history of typo drama. As chronicled by Business Insider, Trump or his staff have misspelled the words \u201ctap,\u201d \u201cpeace,\u201d \u201chereby,\u201d \u201cTheresa May,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d and \u201cunprecedented\u201d \u2014 which the president spelled \u201cunpresidented\u201d \u2014 not to mention countless bastardizations of punctuation and capitalization, in various tweets, statements and other public documents. A retired schoolteacher in Georgia once got a letter from the president, and went viral after taking a pen to the margins to point out a dozen spelling or grammar mistakes.\n\nLater Friday morning, Trump moved on from the Schiff diversion and spent the rest of the morning tweeting attacks on his perceived enemies, starting with what he called an \u201cObama loving\u201d New York Times reporter \u2014 resuming his hyphen-bungling.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018The buck stops with everybody\u2019: How Trump twists cliches to do his bidding\n\nDo you really believe this is the most important election of our lives?
