Mr. Johnson cut short a trip to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, flying back to face a defiant Parliament, a looming Brexit deadline and a new threat of scandal over government funds directed to a woman he was close to.\n\nMr. Johnson has vowed to deliver Brexit as scheduled on Oct. 31, even if he has not struck a deal with the European Union on Britain\u2019s withdrawal by then. Parliament has voted, over his strenuous objections, to prohibit leaving without an agreement, which economists say would be economically damaging.\n\nDetermined to set the nation\u2019s Brexit course, the prime minister had suspended Parliament for five weeks, until Oct. 14, sharply limiting the ability of dissenting lawmakers to get in his way.", "description": "For now, Labour Party leaders would rather watch Prime Minister Boris Johnson squirm than to press for new elections.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/world/24parliament-live1/24parliament-live1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
