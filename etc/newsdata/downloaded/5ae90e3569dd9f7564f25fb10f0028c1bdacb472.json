She was flown to the United States by private jet under apparent guidance by the U.S. Embassy in London.\n\nNow, the Dunn family are in New York to try to put pressure on the American government and hopefully even speak to President Donald Trump to urge him to send Sacoolas back to the U.K. to face justice.\n\n\u201cI just want to talk to him man to man, father to father,\u201d Tim Dunn told reporters Monday morning. \u201cAs a man, as a father... how could he let this happen?\u201d\n\nDunn was able to see his son in the moments after the crash. The 19-year-old\u2019s motorcycle had burst into flames on impact with Sacoolas\u2019 Volvo SUV, and a friend who worked at the fire department called and told him his son might have been involved in the accident. Dunn told CBS News Monday morning what it was like, and how he could see the broken bones protruding from his son\u2019s arms. Dunn says his son kept telling him it was harder and harder to breathe as they put him into the ambulance. That was the last time he saw his son alive.\n\nAmy Jeffress, the Washington, D.C.-based lawyer representing Sacoolas, issued a statement over the weekend, but she has not yet met with anyone from the Dunn family in person. \u201cAnne is devastated by this tragic accident,\u201d the statement says. \u201cNo loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family.\u201d\n\nThe statement goes on to say that the media reporting of the events have been \u201cinaccurate in many respects.\u201d Jeffress says her client \u201cfully cooperated with the police and the investigation\u201d and that she spoke with authorities at the scene of the accident and met with police at her home the following day.\n\n\u201cAnne would like to meet with Mr. Dunn\u2019s parents so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident,\u201d the statement says. \u201cWe have been in contact with the family\u2019s attorneys and look forward to hearing from them.\u201d\n\nAt the Monday press conference, the Dunns said they would like to meet with Sacoolas, too, but only under the condition that she return to the U.K. \u201cWe\u2019re not inhumane,\u201d Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t wish her any ill harm, but we need to hear it from her, in her own words, on our terms, in the U.K.\u201d\n\nDunn\u2019s father would also like to know if Sacoolas tried to comfort his son after the crash. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to ask if she could explain the moment of the crash, and find out if she comforted Harry, if she spoke to Harry,\u201d he said. \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine my lad being in the ditch and not having anyone comfort him.\u201d\n\nShortly after the accident, the Dunns said they told police they wanted to reduce any sentence Sacoolas might be handed for the death of their son. \u201cWe had wanted to reduce her sentence knowing that she had children,\u201d Dunn\u2019s mother told reporters through tears. \u201cWe had asked for it to be suspended so we wouldn\u2019t take her away from her children.\u201d\n\nBut because Sacoolas fled, she may indeed face prison time if she goes back to the U.K. The British Foreign Office suggested over the weekend that Sacoolas never had diplomatic immunity in the first place and, even if she did, it would be waived now that she is no longer living outside of the U.S. The Dunns have hired a team of lawyers on both sides of the Atlantic who specialize in international law and immunity and the investigation is still underway in Croughton.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple enough,\u201d Dunn\u2019s father said. \u201cOn that night, a lady made a mistake. She killed our son. She didn't mean to cause the accident. But then they made a mistake. The people on the other side of this dispute need to understand one thing: We will get justice for Harry.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
