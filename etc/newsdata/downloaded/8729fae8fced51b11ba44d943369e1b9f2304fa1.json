Benn is currently undefeated in 15 fights.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know if I can watch his. I don\u2019t know... I don\u2019t think so. I was watching him sparring and I got quite emotional. It\u2019s not nice, not a nice feeling. I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for my mum. It weren\u2019t a nice feeling. He\u2019s my dad. It\u2019s not nice. I know the risk of this sport. It\u2019s not a nice sport, really.\"\n\n\"We have all these incidents happening. I question myself doing this sometimes. What\u2019s worth more, my health or my wealth? Is it worth it? I remind myself I\u2019m a fighter. We know the risks. My dad doing it, think about all the wars he\u2019s had and he\u2019s come out unscathed. Why would you go and dabble your feet back in that pond?\"", "description": "Conor Benn has revealed that he may not be able to watch his father Nigel Benn from ringside when the former two-weight world champion makes his comeback on November 23, after 23 years away from the sport.", "authors": ["Gareth A Davies", "Boxing Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/boxing/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000213659364-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMNXAjrQuC5hshkZY4lLDITLc2RSN87h2tEpyeVqDDtY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
