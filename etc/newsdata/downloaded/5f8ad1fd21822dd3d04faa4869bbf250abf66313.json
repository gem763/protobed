Of course I am.\u2019\n\nHe also sought to blame a lack of support from big investors for his problems.\n\nHe said: \u2018The capital markets are failing development. Their fundamental role is to provide risk capital to enable growth to take place economically.\u2019\n\n\u2018Long-term capital just really doesn\u2019t exist any more. Big institutions will define long-term now as three years, and that\u2019s ridiculous because you can\u2019t build anything in three years of significance.\n\nAnd so it essentially means that you see capital provision having to go through another filter, which is that only big companies are allowed to do big projects.\u2019\n\nSirius will spend the next six months cutting costs and weighing up whether it can raise money from capital markets or strike a deal with a strategic investor.\n\nBringing a strategic investor on board \u2013 or going private \u2013 would likely dilute or completely wipe out existing retail investors\u2019 holdings.\n\nBut, according to Fraser this could be necessary for the company to complete its huge project, which includes constructing two mile-deep shafts and a 23-mile tunnel \u2013 longer than the Channel Tunnel \u2013 to shift polyhalite, a type of potash fertiliser, to a port on Teesside.\n\nSirius has cut 300 jobs so far and more will follow, depending on when a financing deal is agreed. If it doesn\u2019t manage to secure the cash, it will go into liquidation.", "description": "Chris Fraser said being a publicly-listed company was useful at the start when it wanted to be transparent about its plans to build a \u00a34bn fertiliser mine under the North York Moors national park.", "authors": ["Francesca Washtell For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
