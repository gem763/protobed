As those accusations surfaced, reports indicated that the president had sought to backtrack from his apology over the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, in which he made vulgar comments about women. He also reportedly told aides that it wasn\u2019t him in that video. He has also previously denied assaulting anyone or kissing anyone without consent.\n\nBut, the man on the bus who laughed along with Mr Trump in that tape, Billy Bush, pushed back on Mr Trump\u2019s denials. Bush said that it most certainly was the man who would later become president speaking in the video.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The White House has denied this most recent accusation, as have some members of the Trump team who say they were present.\n\nJessica Leeds, a former traveling salesperson, alleged that Mr Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt while on a first-class flight in the 1980s. Ms Leeds was in her late 30s at the time.\n\nIvana Trump, Mr Trump\u2019s first wife, once used the word \u201crape\u201d to describe an encounter with him. The accusation was made in a 1993 book following a divorce settlement between the two. She has since softened her language, saying that she didn\u2019t mean the word in a \u201cliteral or criminal sense\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
