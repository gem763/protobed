But the White House op-ed inaccurately claimed the Washington Post didn\u2019t report stories that it actually did cover.\n\nTrump\u2019s Saturday tweet was a capstone to a week when Grisham has given indications how she plans to operate as press secretary, the president engaged in a six-day battle with the press over his misleading claim Alabama was due to take a harder hit from Hurricane Dorian than models suggested at the time, and a White House decision to revoke a reporter\u2019s press pass was blocked by a district court judge.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": ""}
