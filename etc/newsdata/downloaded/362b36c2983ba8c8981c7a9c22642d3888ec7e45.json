The onus is on us to do that work and now that we have the governance structure in place, we can now demonstrate this improvement.\u201d\n\nThe CEO of Calibra \u2014 Libra\u2019s corresponding wallet \u2014 added that any wallet could participate in the network, so long as it was compliant with AML and know-your-customer standards.
