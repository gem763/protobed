President Donald Trump also weighed in, but only to chide past critics of his for failing to also condemn China.\n\nNow, Washington\u2019s local NBA team is also hearing the noise.\n\nWizards game sees several Hong Kong protesters\n\nA day after a couple at a Philadelphia 76ers preseason game was ejected for holding up signs reading \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d near the bench of China\u2019s Guangzhou Loong Lions, a Washington Wizards exhibition against the same team saw even more vocal protesters on Wednesday.\n\nActivists carrying signs reading \u201cFree Hong Kong,\u201d \u201cFreedom is a universal value\u201d and \u201cShame on the NBA\u201d were seen outside multiple entrances to the Capital One Arena.\n\nHappening now outside Capital One Arena pic.twitter.com/DfNDP7HPvK \u2014 Candace Buckner (@CandaceDBuckner) October 9, 2019\n\nProtests going on outside of Capital One Arena for tonight\u2019s Wizards game Guangzhou Loong-Lions of the Chinese Basketball Association pic.twitter.com/vmYDyMyx0n \u2014 Troy Haliburton (@TroyHalibur) October 9, 2019\n\nAnother group of the demonstrators hand out the same black and yellow \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d t shirts in the pedestrian alley off 7th Street pic.twitter.com/DdnHSHeaHP \u2014 Candace Buckner (@CandaceDBuckner) October 9, 2019\n\nEven more protesters made it into the game, including one man holding a sign who yelled \u201cFreedom of speech, free Hong Kong,\u201d after the singing of the Chinese national anthem.\n\nAt the end of the Chinese national anthem and during the silence before the singing of the Star Spangled Banner, a protestor screams \u201cFree Hong Kong!\u201d while holding a sign. He walks out of the arena peacefully, followed by an usher. pic.twitter.com/H9JrZHb9FO \u2014 Candace Buckner (@CandaceDBuckner) October 9, 2019\n\nA group of protesters also captured on video an interaction with an official in which their \u201cGoogle Uyghurs\u201d sign was confiscated.\n\nThe sign refers to the Uyghurs, a Muslim ethnic group that is experiencing mass imprisonment by the Chinese government and even reports of forced organ harvesting. Roughly a million members of the group are reportedly held in camps in the Xinjiang region, where the NBA also holds a training center.\n\nOur \u201cGoogle Uyghurs\u201d sign has been confiscated. pic.twitter.com/fX4tF4oOxR \u2014 Jon Schweppe (@JonSchweppe) October 9, 2019\n\nThe official confronting the protesters can be heard telling them \u201cWe\u2019re not allowing any political signs.\u201d That even just two words calling attention to the plight of the Uyghurs can be considered too political for the league as it frantically tries to avoid losing its lucrative Chinese market without hurting its own domestic reputation tells you a lot about where we are right now.\n\nAsked about the protests after the game, Wizards head coach Scott Brooks predictably avoided voicing any sort of thought on the matter.\n\n#Wizards coach Scott Brooks was asked about the several protests that occurred during the game against a team from the Chinese Basketball Association. At least a dozen times people shouted pro-Hong Kong messages.\n\n\n\nHere are the complete questions and Brooks\u2019 responses in full. pic.twitter.com/wvQslpps3G \u2014 Candace Buckner (@CandaceDBuckner) October 10, 2019\n\nWednesday\u2019s game in Washington undoubtedly won\u2019t be the last time we hear about the Hong Kong protests, which were sparked in the semi-autonomous state during the summer over a bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland.\n\nMorey\u2019s tweet called plenty of attention to the protests, which have experienced human rights violations at the hands of police according to Amnesty International. China\u2019s complete erasure of the Rockets in the country and attempts to suppress the conversation have done so even more.\n\nActivists hold up a sign before an NBA exhibition basketball game between the Washington Wizards and the Guangzhou Loong-Lions, Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2019, in Washington.
