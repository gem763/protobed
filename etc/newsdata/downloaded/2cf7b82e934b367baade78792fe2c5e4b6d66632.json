Fitch Ratings: Global Telcos' 5G Capex Risk Contained; Leverage Stretched\n\n(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10091851 Fitch Ratings-London/Chicago/NY/Singapore-October 07: 5G capex risk for most telcos is likely to be contained over the next 18 months, says Fitch Ratings. However, the pressure to acquire wider spectrum bands to support future 5G rollout will reduce rating headroom. Fitch expects leverage metrics to be stretched over the next three years, as higher operating cash flows typically lag investment outlays. Early 5G deployments are therefore likely to favour operators with significant scale and strong balance sheets, although a shared model may offer smaller companies cost advantages to spur competition. Early monetisation of 5G use may be limited, and the upcoming 5G spectrum auctions will keep telcos' free cash flow (FCF) subdued. South Korean telcos are likely to be among the global leaders' 5G investments, raising their capex/revenue (excluding spectrum) to 20%-22% through 2020 (2018: 16%), which is broadly in line with the average ratio for most regions. Fitch expects capex intensity in Europe to average around 20% in 2019-2020, although some telcos had previously demonstrated the ability to manage their leverage profiles through dividend cuts and asset disposals. In the US, the two largest wireless carriers are likely to maintain their capex intensity at around 13%, given the incremental capex for software and hardware upgrades while leveraging existing 4G networks for nationwide 5G rollout. The impact of a 5G upcycle and spectrum payments will, however, put more pressure on operators' FCF in emerging markets, such as India, the Philippines, Indonesia and Sri Lanka where the capex intensity is already above 30%, although widespread 5G rollout is not likely in these countries in the shorter term. Meanwhile, we anticipate a delay in 5G capex spending in Latin America, as operators are still transitioning to 4G. 5G implementation will remain patchy until 2021, when a robust handset ecosystem is in place. We expect most telecoms markets to depend on existing 4G and 4G Plus technologies to provide sufficient speeds to cater for data demand in the next few years. Successful execution of 5G will take years to implement, as the ability of operators to meaningfully monetise these services and drive consumers' willingness to pay remain uncertain. Fitch presents our views on global 5G deployments; the importance of access to sufficient and affordable spectrum; the technology's potential to disrupt competition; and the possibilities for collaborative approaches to accelerate 5G rollout.\n\nThe report, \"Global Telecoms: The Winding Road to 5G\", is available at www.fitchratings.com or by clicking the link in this media release.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein.

Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).
