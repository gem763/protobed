Just go to the wallet or account and send the amount of XRP you want to sell over to the appropriate address. Remember that the XRP can take a while to show up in your exchange account.\n\nHow to sell Ripple for USD\n\nYou can either sell the XRP directly for USD on an exchange that accepts XRP deposits and USD withdrawals, or you can trade your XRP for another cryptocurrency first, and then exchange that currency for USD on an exchange that accepts USD withdrawals. The latter option leaves you with more exchanges to choose from, but it also involves more steps.\n\nThe following exchanges allow you to deposit XRP and withdraw USD. Each name in the list links to the exchange\u2019s sign up page:\n\nSteps to selling Ripple for USD\n\nIn order to sell XRP on any of these exchanges, you must follow some general steps:\n\nRegister to create an account, and confirm through email.\n\nVerify the account. Even in exchanges with optional verification, the ability to withdraw fiat currencies will require at least your name, country, pictures of ID documents like a national ID card or passport, and sometimes a proof of residence. You can read a more detailed description of the sign up and verification processes at Bitstamp and Kraken here.\n\nDeposit XRP into the account\u2019s wallet. Only Gatehub and Bitfinex charge a fee for this action (see the table below).\n\nSell the XRP and buy USD.\n\nWithdraw the USD (see withdrawal fees and methods in the table below).\n\nVerification processes\n\nThe exchanges mentioned in the list all require verification in order for users to withdraw USD. The specific requirements are:\n\nBitfinex: complete online form, phone number, email address, residential address, two forms of valid government issued identification with picture (passport, national ID card, driving license, residency card, employment permit card, etc.), a bank statement highlighting name as the account holder (your first deposit to Bitfinex must come from this account) and a proof of residence (statement not older than 3 months from a utility, service company, licensed corporation or government authority)\n\nBitstamp: name, address, ZIP code, date of birth, country, city, an ID document and a proof of residence (a bank account statement, a utility bill, a government-issued document such as tax statement, certificate of residency, etc.).\n\nExmo: either a national passport, an international passport, or a personal ID-card (both sides); a proof of residence (bank statement, utility bill, tax documents, or proof of residence issued by local authority), a printed and signed user agreement, and a selfie with the user holding the ID with their EXMO account open in the background.\n\nGatehub: phone, profile photo, profile information, ID (passport, national ID card or driver\u2019s license) and proof of residence.\n\nBitsane: ID (ID card or passport), proof of residence (bank statement, tax assessment or utility company bills), and possibly a photo of the user holding the ID in their hand.\n\nKraken: name, date of birth, country, phone number, proof of residence (like a utility bill.

Register for an account here. Then open your confirmation email and click the enclosed link to log in. At this point, you'll be asked to set up two-factor authentication (2FA), which we recommend you do.\n\n2. If you wish to trade more than 2 BTC's value daily, you should upgrade to a Level 2 or Level 3 account. Click \"Send verification documents\" on the right side of the screen to level up. You'll need to have a 2FA installed for this.\n\nOptional verification on Binance:\n\nYou can choose to verify with personal info or enterprise info. The first will require your full name, gender, country, and passport ID, plus a JPEG photo of your passport, or national ID card, or driver\u2019s license. For the latter you must submit company name and address, and then fill out a Google form with more in-depth info.\n\n3. Hover over \"Funds\" on the upper black bar (right side of the screen) and select \"Deposit\". Then, click on the \"Select Deposits Coin\" window and select XRP from the drop-down menu. You will see your balance and orders placed.\n\n4. You'll need a deposit address and a deposit tag to deposit XRP to Binance. Here the site will remind you of two important things: \"send only XRP to this deposit address. Sending any other currency to this address may result in the loss of your deposit\" and \"depositing Ripple to Binance requires BOTH a deposit address and a deposit Tag. If you fail to include the tag with your deposit the funds will be lost forever.\"\n\n5. Carefully copy the currency deposit address shown. Go to the place (wallet or account) where your XRP are stored and request a withdrawal or transfer to the address you copied. The XRP will be deposited immediately after 1 network confirmation, and you can track the progress on the history page here (or go to Funds>Transaction history).\n\n6. When the deposit is confirmed, go to \"Exchange\" on the top left corner of the screen and select \"Basic\".\n\nYou'll find a search bar on the top right corner. Type XRP into it, and click either the BTC button or the ETH button you'll find immediately to the right, depending which one you want to trade the XRP for. Then click the displayed trading pair.\n\n7. You'll see the trading view for the pair you chose. Look below for the box saying \"Sell XRP\". Type in the desired amount and the price, then click the pink \"Sell XRP button\" at the bottom.\n\n8. Your order has been placed! Go to the top right corner to \"Orders\" and click on \"Trade history\" to check how much you've sold.\n\nThe following tables compare the fees at exchanges that take XRP deposits and trade them for other cryptocurrencies.\n\nXRP/BTC pair\n\nXRP/ETH\n\nXRP/LTC\n\nExchange Bitsane XRP deposit Free Transaction fee Maker 0.15 percent Taker 0.25 percent\n\nXRP/XLM\n\nExchange RippleFox Stellarport XRP deposit No info on deposit fees No info on deposit fees Transaction fee 0.20 percent Maker free Taker 0.15 percent\n\nXRP/DASH\n\nExchange Bitsane XRP deposit Free Transaction fee Maker 0.15 percent Taker 0.25 percent\n\nHow to sell Ripple via peer-to-peer networks\n\nThis section will sound familiar if you read our article on buying XRP. We mentioned that the only option to buy or sell Ripple peer-to-peer (P2P) right now is through an exchange called Cointal.\n\nWhy would you want to sell P2P? While there may be limited options, selling P2P has its perks compared to centralized exchanges. P2P exchanges are run by software; sellers and buyers are automatically connected, with no human intervention (for more information, see our article here). This implies no verification is required, meaning you can keep your personal information private.\n\nYou can create a Cointal account here, or just browse their offers here.\n\nIf you do, you\u2019ll see a page where you can choose to sell or buy (select \u201csell\u201d in this case), and a list of currencies (select the Ripple icon). You can also modify the search by entering an amount, a currency you\u2019re selling for (USD), and a payment method. Below, you\u2019ll see a list of open offers.\n\nCointal fees\n\nCointal automatically detracts a small transaction fee from your wallet. Deposits and purchases are free of charge. Withdrawals and selling both incur a 1 percent fee.\n\nSafety tips for trading P2P\n\nBecause P2P exchanges just connect you with another user to buy or sell, there is no third-party authority to protect you if you get scammed. So how come people risk it at all?\n\nCointal offers two safeguards against fraud. On the one hand, they do offer to indemnify scam victims. On the other hand, they have a community-based trust rating system. Every time a user successfully engages in business with another user, they can rate them as a \u201ctrusted seller\u201d. When trading in Cointal, you should always check, next to each seller\u2019s user name, to the far left, for a \u201ctrusted seller\u201d tag. Remember to do your part and rate people as well!\n\nCointal strongly recommends not to give other users any personal information. The site does not ask for any info such as email address or phone number. If another user asks you to provide this info, immediately inform the Cointal support team.\n\nShould I sell Ripple?\n\nThe thing with literally every single cryptocurrency out there is that it\u2019s really hard to predict exactly how it will behave in the market that is known to fluctuate so much.\n\nHowever, Ripple has already established itself as one of the most stable currencies in existence. At the time of writing it comfortably sits in 3rd place in terms of market capitalization, with only Bitcoin and Ethereum in front.\n\nMoreover, Ripple\u2019s blockchain is one of the most advanced there is. According to their website, it already consistently handles around 1,500 transactions per second, which puts Bitcoin\u2019s current maximum of 7 to shame.\n\nFinally, Ripple\u2019s extensive network of partnerships (including Apple, Santander, Western Union, and countless other banks, institutions and organization) definitely adds to XPR\u2019s potential growth.\n\nObjectively, as things currently stand, Ripple is one of the smartest and secure investment opportunities available in the cryptocurrency market.
