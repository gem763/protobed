Harris Associates owns an 8.1% stake in Credit Suisse.\n\nThe futures of top Credit Suisse executives including CEO Tidjane Thiam are coming into question as law firm Homburger completes its inquiry into the situation. Credit Suisse's board of directors is expected to meet sometime next week to discuss the issue and review Homburger's report.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Urs Rohner, the chairman of the bank's board, is expected to move quickly to take punitive action against Credit Suisse's senior management if they're found responsible for the surveillance.\n\nEarlier this week it was reported that Credit Suisse hired a private investigator to follow Khan after he joined rival firm UBS. Khan reportedly left the firm due to disagreements with Thiam.\n\nThe ex-CEO of Credit Suisse's International Wealth Management unit noticed he was being followed while driving in Zurich with his wife last week. Khan took photos of the passengers in the vehicle, which led to a physical altercation as the pursuers attempted to take his phone and the photos he took, according to Bloomberg.\n\nRead more: A hedge fund manager who oversees $2 billion lays out the road to profitability for Uber and Lyft \u2014 and explains why they have a unique bull case compared to WeWork", "description": "Top Credit Suisse shareholder Harris Associates warned the firm's reputation could be damaged if any top executives are fired over the surveillance of for...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d8dfe192e22af740e012c98-2400/2019-02-14t094918z1550790824rc19e77b00c0rtrmadp3credit-suisse-gp-results.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
