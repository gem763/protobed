Having seen two match points go by against Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon final, Federer suffered some kind of back spasm shortly before his five-set quarter-final loss to Grigor Dimitrov on Tuesday night.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFederer was able to play through the pain and stiffness, and might have even won had he not encountered a superbly focused Dimitrov. But in view of the tightness of the margins \u2013 Dimitrov won 51 per cent of the points in his 3-6, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory \u2013 it is hard not to feel that this minor but disastrously timed injury made the difference.\n\nJust to add to Federer\u2019s irritation, he has clearly suffered this problem before, and knew it would probably clear up with a little rest. Given the two-day break before the men\u2019s semi-finals \u2013 and the fact that Djokovic had already gone out of the tournament with shoulder problems of his own \u2013 here was a rare opportunity to land a first US Open title since 2008.\n\n\u201cI have a good idea what the injury is,\u201d Federer told the Swiss journalist Simon Graf after the match. \u201cIt\u2019s something that will bother me today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Then it will be okay. That makes it even more disappointing that I didn\u2019t find a way today.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was a disappointing result for New York\u2019s tennis-lovers too. Tickets for the final were soaring in price, based on the theory that Federer would end up playing Rafael Nadal for the first time at this tournament. According to the events site TicketiQ, the cheapest seat stood at $351 on Saturday but had climbed to $479 by Tuesday, after Djokovic\u2019s unexpected exit cleared Federer\u2019s path. But the Big Three are not invincible, despite their shared sequence of 11 straight majors.\n\nBy overcoming Federer in a match few thought he could win, Dimitrov followed in the footsteps of of John Millman here last year, and Tommy Robredo in 2013. The US Open tends to throw up more unpredictable results than the other slams, by virtue of its position near the end of a long season, and the 2019 edition has been no exception.\n\nWhat a boost this tournament has been for Dimitrov, a player who used to be known as \u201cBaby Fed\u201d because his game bears a close resemblance to that of Federer. For a man who has been ranked as high as No 3 in the world, he has endured a miserable season, arriving in New York on a run of eight defeats from nine matches.\n\nDimitrov has been working with a pair of illustrious coaches in Andre Agassi and Radek Stepanek, but neither has been here this fortnight, and he started his campaign out on the boondocks of Court 11, grinding out a four-set victory over veteran Italian Andreas Seppi.\n\nThen, due to face 12th seed Borna Coric in a second-round match that might have proved too much for him, Dimitrov received a walkover when Coric pulled out with a bad back. \u201cYou just never know when a little bit of luck smiles at you,\u201d he said, earlier in the tournament.\n\nAnd so Dimitrov is into his third major semi-final, having lost to Djokovic and Nadal in the previous two. His opponent tomorrow will be 23-year-old Russian Daniil Medvedev, who will need all of his two rest days after straining a quad muscle during his earlier win over Stan Wawrinka.", "description": "Get unlimited access to all Telegraph Sport for a year for just\u00a0\u00a320 For the second major in a row, Roger Federer suffered a defeat that was painfully hard to swallow.
