Go on, we've got time (and no, we don't mean Cheryl and Liam R.I.P). If Mel B, also known as Scary Spice, reality show judge and all round legend, and James Arthur, winner of the ninth series of The X Factor came to mind then congratulations! You win 100 points!\n\nYep, according to new reports the pair hooked up and had a \"wild fling\" after meeting on America's Got Talent back in 2017, where Mel was on the judging panel and James popped in to perform. An anonymous source (aren't they always?) told The Sun,\"James was single at the time and they hit it off instantly. Mel thought James was very handsome and would become the next big British music superstar.\" The report claims the pair got together soon after Mel's marriage to Stephen Belafonte ended.\n\nPhoto credit: Alvaro Cabrera - Getty Images More\n\nThe source continued, \"James couldn\u2019t believe his luck that a stunning member of the Spice Girls would be interested in him. They had a wild fling and loved spending time together, but it ended respectfully.\u201d Which is, of course, the best way to end such a dalliance. We stan proper closure.\n\nPhoto credit: Getty Images More\n\nCurrently, Mel, 44, follows James, 31, on Instagram but he doesn't follow her back. She's probably too busy with the new Spice Girls movie (which is believed to be released next year) to be bothered anyway.\n\nTo conclude: name a more iconic duo... we'll wait.\n\nCosmopolitan UK have reached out to James Arthur and Mel B about the report.\n\nFollow Jennifer on Twitter and Instagram\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Je suis shocked", "authors": ["Jennifer Savin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IkkHLUlmBCBBRWSYDEQ.kw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/574b45013bd3d6cca2c77e47027047f7", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
