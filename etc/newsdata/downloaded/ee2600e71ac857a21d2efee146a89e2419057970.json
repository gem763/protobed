The younger Biden had served as a director of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nThe two men were each charged by federal prosecutors in New York with two counts of conspiracy, one count of false statements and one of falsification of business records. U.S. law prohibits foreign donations in American elections.\n\nParnas and Fruman were trying to buy political influence to help set up recreational marijuana businesses, prosecutors said. They also said Parnas played a role in a successful effort to have Trump remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cProtecting the integrity of our elections, and protecting our elections from unlawful foreign influence, are core functions of our campaign finance laws,\u201d U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman told reporters in New York. \u201cAnd as this office has made clear, we will not hesitate to investigate and prosecute those who engage in criminal conduct that draws into question the integrity of our political process\u201d\n\nBerman served on Trump\u2019s transition team after Trump was elected president to prepare for taking office in January 2017.\n\nThe indictment said Parnas and Fruman falsely claimed the company, called Global Energy Producers or GEP, which was making the political donations, was \u201ca real business enterprise\u201d and that \u201cits major purpose is energy trading, not political activity.\u201d In fact, the company had no real business, the indictment added.\n\nThe two were arrested at Dulles airport in Virginia on Wednesday night, prosecutors said.\n\nJohn Dowd, the lawyer for Parnas and Fruman, declined to comment on the charges. Dowd previously represented Trump in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation that detailed Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nParnas and Fruman made their initial court appearance in Alexandria, Virginia, with another court date set for next Thursday. They were being represented in the court appearance by lawyers for Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is serving prison time after being convicted last year in Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nFederal Magistrate Judge Michael Nachmanoff imposed a lengthy, strict set of conditions that Parnas and Fruman must meet to be released, including each posting $1 million bond and being placed on GPS monitoring in home detention. The prosecution called the men a flight risk.\n\nAsked for a response, Giuliani told Reuters he had \u201cno involvement\u201d in the flow of money at the heart of the Parnas and Fruman indictment.\n\nLast week, he told Reuters: \u201cParnas and Igor helped me on certain things. They helped me with logistics. They know the Ukraine, they speak Russian. They helped me locate people in a few cases.\u201d\n\nJay Sekulow, a lawyer for the president, told Reuters that \u201cneither the president nor the campaign was aware of their scheme,\u201d referring to the defendants.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has coffee with Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, U.S. September 20, 2019. REUTERS/Aram Roston/File Photo\n\nThe top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, called the developments regarding Giuliani\u2019s associates \u201cvery troubling.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiuliani\u2019s been involved up to his neck in this entire mess. He has an obligation to testify under oath so he can be asked questions and so this can come to light,\u201d Schumer told reporters.\n\nHOUSE SUBPOENAS\n\nParnas and Fruman were both expected to figure in the House impeachment drive and had been asked to produce documents and give testimony. Parnas had been scheduled to take part in a deposition with House lawmakers on Thursday, with Fruman scheduled on Friday. Dowd had called the lawmakers\u2019 demands \u201cunreasonable.\u201d House Democrats on Thursday issued subpoenas for the men to hand over the documents and testify at a later date.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Parnas also sought the help of a U.S. congressman - identified by a person familiar with the matter as Republican Pete Sessions - to get Trump to remove U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Trump eventually did remove Yovanovitch and called her \u201cbad news\u201d in his July 25 call with Zelenskiy.\n\nGiuliani told Reuters last week he had provided information to both Trump and the State Department about Yovanovitch, who he suggested was biased against Trump. Yovanovitch is scheduled to give testimony in the House impeachment inquiry on Friday.\n\nSessions lost his House seat from Texas last year to a Democrat. In a statement quoted by Politico, he said his motivation in urging the removal of Yovanovitch was his belief that \u201cpolitical appointees should not be disparaging the president, especially while serving overseas.\u201d\n\nIn another development, House Democrats issued a subpoena for a member of Trump\u2019s Cabinet, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, for documents over any role he may have played in Trump\u2019s effort to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Energy is aware of the House Committees\u2019 letter to Secretary Perry and it is currently under review by DOE\u2019s Office of General Counsel,\u201d said department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes.\n\nProsecutors said Parnas, Fruman and others also conspired to funnel donations to candidates in Nevada, New York and other states to benefit a planned marijuana business funded by an unnamed Russian businessman.\n\nTwo other people were charged in the indictment: David Correia, a U.S. businessman, and Andrey Kukushkin, a Ukrainian-born U.S. businessman who was a vice president of a Russian hedge fund before becoming involved in several marijuana-related businesses in California.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nPhotos from Parnas\u2019 social media accounts show him meeting on various occasions with Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr., Sessions, Republican congressman Kevin Brady and former congressman Carlos Curbelo.\n\nIn an interview last month, Parnas told Reuters that the FBI was investigating him but that he did not know why, and that he did nothing wrong. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the FBI wants. I\u2019m not going to comment, what they are doing. What they did.\u201d\n\nParnas said any violations of U.S. Federal Election Commission rules were unwitting and a \u201cclerical thing\u201d because he was not an experienced political donor. Parnas said he was not trying to hide the source of the $325,000 donation.\n\nKelly Sadler, a spokeswoman for the America First Action political Action Committee, confirmed the pro-Trump group received the $325,000 contribution mentioned in the indictment. Sadler said the organization \u201cplaced that contribution in a segregated bank account,\u201d and it has not been used \u201cfor any purpose.\u201d", "description": "Two foreign-born Florida businessmen who have helped President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani investigate political rival Joe Biden were arrested in a scheme to illegally funnel money to a pro-Trump election committee and other U.S. political candidates, prosecutors said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Aram Roston", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439392525&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9920Z", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
