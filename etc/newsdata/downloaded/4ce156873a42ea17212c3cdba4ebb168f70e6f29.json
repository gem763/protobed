Apparently, even those true believers who pre-ordered the pricey Founder\u2019s Editions may not get access at the launch date.\n\nGoogle officially announced yesterday that the Founder\u2019s Edition was sold out. It pointed any latecomers to the Premium Edition, which offers a similar bundle of items to the Founder\u2019s Edition. One would hope that ordering the bundles now \u2014 almost a month ahead of launch \u2014 would mean you\u2019d get them on Stadia\u2019s launch date, so you can join the rest of the first wave of Stadia supporters.\n\nBut it turns out that\u2019s not the case. The Verge reports that Google is shipping out bundles in the order in which they\u2019re received, meaning even the Founder\u2019s Edition buyers might not get their Chromecast Ultra and Stadia controller until after launch. The very first people to pre-order are most likely to get their kits on that day, but if you waited even a short time to get a better idea of what Stadia is? You might not be so lucky.\n\nGoogle does report it expects both bundles to ship within two weeks of launch. Note that this only applies to the controller and Chromecast \u2014 according to the Stadia site, Google\u2019s sending the codes for Stadia Pro out upon shipment, which hopefully means that you don\u2019t actually have to have the whole kit before you can redeem them. There\u2019s still a chance you might not get your code on launch day, though I hope for the sake of Stadia\u2019s first adopters that\u2019s not the case.\n\nOne more thing: Please note that orders will be shipped out in the order they were received, and when your package ships, you'll receive a code to activate your Stadia account. \u2014 Stadia (@GoogleStadia) October 23, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s still disappointing, in my opinion, that Stadia is being touted as a replacement to the traditional console experience, and yet the only people who\u2019ll have access to it before next year are the people who paid for custom hardware \u2014 which is not very different from the traditional console experience. We also learned not too long ago that Google Stadia is likely to be such a massive data hog it\u2019ll probably make several million gamers hit their data caps. That means there\u2019s a whole contingent of gamers who wouldn\u2019t be able to take advantage of Stadia\u2019s much-ballyhooed 4K streaming even if they wanted to.\n\nCall me a pessimist, but this whole Stadia experiment is starting to feel like more trouble than it\u2019s worth. There\u2019s always the chance the service itself could wow us at launch \u2014 and at this point, that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to have to do.\n\nStadia launches \u2014 nominally, anyway \u2014 on November 19. The non-bundle version should launch some time next year.\n\nGoogle says you might have to wait to play Stadia, even if you preorder on The Verge\n\nRead next: OnePlus' 7T Pro McLaren is coming to the US after all - with T-Mobile's 5G", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FStadia-Controller.jpg&signature=1b6963abb9a0ba22b285bfbd9bb3e676", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
