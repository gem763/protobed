These Bitcoin skeptics believe that this most recent uptrend and collapse in the cryptocurrency market is Bitcoin\u2019s one last attempt at making it big, to allow early adopters and those in the know to cash out.\n\nRelated Reading: Log Scale Monthly Bitcoin Price Chart Suggests Bear Market Was an Uptrend Pullback\n\nHowever, many analysts are convinced that as long as the fundamentals and long-term market structure stay intact, Bitcoin\u2019s pullback is just a given until the true rally after the 2020 halving.\n\nHave No Fear, the Pullback Will End\n\nBitcoin hasn\u2019t had the best time since topping at $14,000 in late June. Since then, its price has bled out by some 42% over a three-month period, leading many to believe that it is only a matter of time before we see an unfortunate redux of 2018\u2019s Crypto Winter.\n\nBut, Josh Rager, a prominent analyst, recently came out to reassure bulls. Rager noted that in 2013\u2019s bull market, BTC \u201cpulled back 75% over 89 days\u201d prior to a 1,600 run-up later in that same year.\n\nWhat he is saying is that Bitcoin\u2019s current downtrend does not put BTC decidedly out of a bull market, and that investors can expect the uptrend to resume in the coming years.\n\nBitcoin 2013 market compared to 2019 2013: Bitcoin bull market pulled back 75% over 89 days before a 1600% run-up to new highs later in the year 2019: Bitcoin has currently retraced 42% over 91 days Price can continue down but expect the bull trend to continue after pullback pic.twitter.com/gCrC65OJ9N \u2014 Josh Rager \ud83d\udcc8 (@Josh_Rager) September 28, 2019\n\nSure, this bull market pullback from $14,000 seems dramatic. But, in reality, it\u2019s just par for the course in Bitcoin standards.\n\nAs reported by NewsBTC previously, ARK Invest\u2019s in-house crypto analyst, Yassine Elmandjra, noted that BTC is currently at \u201csimilar levels of recovery as both 2011-2013 and 2015-2017 recovery periods\u201d.\n\nUPDATE: Day 284 Currently at similar levels of recovery as both 2011-2013 and 2015-2017 recovery periods. pic.twitter.com/ntedTt6vEl \u2014 Yassine Elmandjra (@yassineARK) September 26, 2019\n\nIndeed, as Elmandjra\u2019s chart shows, Bitcoin has recovered to around 40% of its all-time high in 284 days, which is marginally better than what BTC accomplished during two previous cycles.\n\nThis implies that the cryptocurrency market isn\u2019t in another bear market, despite what emotional traders and analysts may be spouting on Twitter.\n\nBitcoin Still Entrapped in Long-Term Bull Trend\n\nRager made the aforementioned statement with the assumption that Bitcoin is still in a macro bull trend. While some may call this shortsighted, he\u2019s right \u2014 according to fundamentals and some price data anyway.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "\"Bitcoin is an echo bubble\", cryptocurrency cynics have cried since BTC hit $14,000 and collapsed in quick succession.
