But in St Austell, on the south coast of Cornwall in between Plymouth and Falmouth, regeneration is on the mind of the family founders of the St Austell Brewery, one of the oldest businesses in town.\n\n\u201cWith St Austell being our home we still feel a great obligation to play an active part in the well-being of the town and the hinterland,\u201d says James Staughton, whose great-great-grandfather set up the brewery in 1851. \u201cWe hope that the local residents frequent our pubs, inns and hotels so we support events that put something back into the community that supports us in turn.\u201d\n\nOn 21 September, St Austell will host the third annual Whitegold festival, an event that draws on the area\u2019s china clay mining history and celebrates its many modern day ceramics artists. It will include the launch of a major international ceramics prize, with artists and collectives invited to submit ideas that use clay to inspire new perspectives and insights into place. The prize and the festival is part of an ambitious plan to reimagine St Austell, boosted by \u00a31m in funding from the Government\u2019s Coastal Communities Fund, which supports the economic development of places on the coast.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cWe hope this will bring more people into the area and give it a greater sense of local identity,\u201d says Dan James, development director of the nearby Eden Project. \u201cWe had this process where the purpose of St Austell wasn\u2019t really recognised and we were trying to create a cultural reimagining of St Austell that differentiated it using ceramics and horticulture.\u201d\n\nSt Austell is the largest town in Cornwall, but it suffers from a lack of identity compared to some of its neighbours like Falmouth, which is known for its art school, or Newquay, which is popular for extreme sports.\n\nThe giant biospheres of the Eden Project, which landed in a 160-year-old exhausted china clay quarry at nearby Bodelva in 2001, welcomed over one million visitors in the financial year ending March and its 20th million since it opened. Eden claims to have contributed \u00a32m to the local economy, mostly through supply chains.\n\nBut there is a realisation among Eden executives and other business owners on the St Austell Bay economic forum (Sabef), a group of local business leaders that have joined together to promote economic growth in St Austell, that the proximity of Eden is not enough to lift the prospects of St Austell on its own.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that one million people come to Eden every year and not enough of those people make the extra visit to the town centre,\u201d James says. \u201cHow do we increase the profile of this great landscape? Because it\u2019s not considered a tourism hotspot \u2013 not enough people come to the town centre and we want to buck that trend.\u201d\n\nSabef has come up with twin regeneration plans that draw on the china clay mining history of the area and its newer identity for horticulture, based not only on Eden but on other nearby gardens including Tregrehan, Heligan and Pine Lodge.\n\nTen thousand ceramic tiles handmade by local residents are being made into a mosaic on a wall in the town centre and there are plans to create a wildflower corridor along the major road networks and along roundabouts and on strategic buildings. \u201cYou\u2019ll start to see the creation of clay exhibits or garden installations that bring it all to life,\u201d James says.\n\nChina clay was discovered in the St Austell area by William Cookworthy in the 18th century. It gradually overtook the mining of copper and tin as the main industry in the area after the metals suffered a fall in prices.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, 7,000 local people were employed in the local clay mining industry that supplied 50 per cent of world\u2019s porcelain. But like many British post-industrial towns, St Austell went into rapid decline as business moved overseas. English China Clay was sold to Imerys, the French conglomerate, in 1999 and hundreds of jobs were lost as operations moved to Brazil.\n\nThe current Whitegold festival started as a pop-up festival in 2016 and has grown steadily over three years. \u201cIt\u2019s about engaging with local people and trying to encourage pride in their heritage but also connecting across the UK and globally as well,\u201d says curator Alex Murdin. \u201cWe\u2019re still at the start of that journey but we are making progress.\u201d\n\nHe notes that the local china clay museum has a new gallery space, a new workshop and an education space. Meanwhile the 18th century market house is being redeveloped as a space people in the arts. Regeneration plans include an idea for a clay trail around the old mines for walkers and cyclists.\n\n\u201cThe pits were seen as a detractor, but we\u2019re beginning to see how they can be used to draw tourists,\" Murdin says.\n\nHe believes that their efforts must start by engaging local people to take pride in their place first, before it can be effective at reaching tourists. \u201cSt Austell is a post-industrial town with the problems that go along with that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re searching for a different story to tell people with china clay at its heart.\u201d", "description": "Craft breweries are often an early sign of gentrification in the industrial districts of UK\u00a0cities, colonising abandoned warehouses and bringing hipsters out of town to spend their cash.
