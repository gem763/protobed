The smugglers are using the vests too, and even going so far as to \u201cclone\u201d construction company trucks to try to fool Border Patrol agents.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know how many times the tactic has been successful, but The Times has uncovered at least three cases in the last couple of months where agents were able to sniff out the ruses and nab people involved.\n\n\u201cThe current construction of the U.S./Mexico International Boundary Fence (IBF) has helped smugglers blend in with legitimate construction vehicles in this area,\u201d Agent Anna Davalos told a judge in an affidavit support smuggling charges in one of the cases, an Oct. 15 attempt in the desert west of Calexico.\n\nAgents tell The Times they expected it. They saw the same thing a decade ago, during a previous round of fence-building under President George W. Bush, and even before that when parts of California were first fenced off from Mexico.\n\nEach time, after fencing was constructed illegal immigration in those areas dropped, and agents say that\u2019s what they expect this time too \u2014 though for now Customs and Border Protection acknowledged the construction is causing new opportunities \u201cto exploit real or perceived vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s quest to dramatically expand the existing border wall is likely to create plenty of opportunity for construction-related mischief.\n\nShould the courts and Congress cooperate, the president says he expects some 400 miles of wall to be built from 2017 to 2020. Some of that will be new wall, while other sections will replace current, though outdated, fencing.\n\nSo far, the lion\u2019s share of construction far has been in California and western Arizona, where the government already owns much of the land and building is relatively easy. But the administration earlier this month announced commencement of dozens of miles in the Rio Grande Valley area of Texas.\n\nSo far, no new mileage of the border has been fenced in. All construction has been replacement of existing walls or vehicle barriers, or adding a secondary wall set back from the primary border wall. The two walls create a no-go zone in between, where migrants are more easily captured.\n\nIn at least one of the cases The Times uncovered, a fake construction vehicle was used to gain access to that no-man\u2019s land.\n\nCBP, which oversees the Border Patrol, insisted there are ways to deal with those situations.\n\n\u201cWhile CBP can\u2019t disclose specific strategies we use, we can say that through situational awareness, intelligence capabilities, and rapid response we prevent these smuggling attempts from succeeding,\u201d the agency said.\n\nOne of those tactics is asking legitimate construction trucks to hang tags from their rear-view mirrors. Agents can quickly tell authentic traffic that way.\n\nLack of a tag was how agents nabbed Angelica Jessica Lopez, the woman charged with the Oct. 15 smuggling run. Court documents say Ms. Lopez was caught with three illegal immigrants from Mexico, who paid $7,000 apiece to be smuggled into the country.\n\nIn another case a month earlier, agents spotted three illegal immigrants cross in an area the Border Patrol calls \u201cJonny Wolf\u2019s,\u201d near the Otay Mesa border crossing point.\n\nA remote surveillance camera spotted four people jump the border wearing orange work vests, in what agents said was \u201can attempt to blend in with the construction crews.\u201d\n\nOne of the persons \u2014 presumably the foot guide \u2014 then returned to Mexico, while three others climbed into a truck that had been waiting for them. Agents stopped the truck and arrested the driver, who said he was getting $800 for the smuggling run, and the three migrants, who had paid $7,000 apiece.\n\nAlso in September agents in San Diego tracked a Ford F-250 truck tricked out to look like a construction company vehicle, as it cruised along the border wall construction zone near the San Ysidro Port of Entry.\n\nAgents said they suspected the truck had made previous runs, and they managed to stop it this time as it drove out of a restricted construction zone. They arrested the driver \u2014 a juvenile they didn\u2019t identify \u2014 and a passenger, both of whom were wearing orange work vests in addition to the fake construction truck.\n\nInside the truck\u2019s bed, which was covered by a shell, agents found 22 illegal immigrants, some of whom said they feared for their life from overcrowding and lack of seats, seatbelts or water.\n\nChris Harris, recently retired from the Border Patrol in San Diego, said construction crews will sometimes report funny business, helping agents sniff out imposters trying to hide among the flurry of work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cat and mouse game,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cBut when you realize they\u2019re trying to smuggle narcotics, or worse, then it becomes much more, \u2018You don\u2019t want to get burned.\u2019\u201d\n\nCloning is an age-old tactic for border smugglers.\n\nFake FedEx and UPS delivery trucks have been used, as have fake \u2014 and real \u2014 ambulances.\n\nIn one case over the summer agents at a highway checkpoint in South Texas stopped an ambulance that claimed to be transporting a patient. The driver\u2019s nervous behavior tipped off the agent on duty, and when he began to ask questions the story fell apart \u2014 at the same time as another agent\u2019s dog began to alert on the vehicle as carrying drugs or migrants.\n\nThey discovered six illegal immigrants in the back of the ambulance, including one who was pretending to be a patient, strapped to a stretcher with a neck brave, an oxygen mask and an intravenous drip, according to court documents.\n\nThe driver admitted to agents he was being paid $2,000 to drive the six from McAllen to Houston, and his co-conspirator said he was getting an additional $1,000. Two of the smuggled migrants told agents they had paid the co-conspirator $3,500 apiece as the final installments in their smuggling fees.\n\nOther fakes over the last few years included a bogus adult-care van in Texas in July 2018, and a bogus paramedics\u2019 truck a month later.\n\nWhile some of the cloned vehicles are good fakes, often they don\u2019t stand up to close scrutiny.\n\nAgents said smugglers will time their runs to coincide with Border Patrol shift changes, figuring that they may be able to fool the surveillance cameras and, with agents either headed back to base our from base to the field, won\u2019t have to survive an up-close examination.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
