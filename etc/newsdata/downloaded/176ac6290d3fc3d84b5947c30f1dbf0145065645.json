He said he likes killing people,' Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, said in a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n'We know he's killed at least three people. He tried to kill our deputies last night. This guy needs the death penalty if there's ever anyone who needed the death penalty.'\n\nStanley 'Woo Woo' Mossburg, 35, is suspected of killing someone in Tennessee October 1, then killing two roommates of an elderly man in Florida on Sunday\n\nAn elderly man returned home to find his male roommate dead and female friend tied up before she was eventually killed. Pictured is the nearby scene when Mossburg was captured\n\nCops said Mossburg told the surviving victim his goal was to kill 11 people.\n\nMossburg was staying in a house nearby the crime scene with strangers he's asked for a place to crash.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sheriff Judd spoke about the suspect's route from a killing on October 1 in Tennessee, to Winter Garden, Florida on Sunday.\n\nAt 10.30pm on Sunday, the surviving victim arrived home, where he lived with his two friends, and heard the female victim say: 'Just do what he says and he won't hurt you.'\n\nSeeing the female victim bound in chair, Mossburg approached the surviving male victim saying, 'I have guns and knives, I'll kill you if you resist me' and 'Don't look in master bedroom, you won't like what you see.'\n\nMossburg then tied the man to a chair using computer cords before demanding money and valuables.\n\nThe surviving victim managed to escape 'Woo Woo' Mossburg (pictured left, center, and right) after the suspect temporarily left the home, and he called police from a neighbor's place on Monday evening. An overnight stand-off lasted until 5.10am Tuesday\n\nThe suspected killer then revealed to the hostage - who cops say 'is elderly on medicine' - that his first victim in the home tried to fight back 'so I made him suffer before I killed him'.\n\nHe added that 'he killed the female victim quickly because she was cooperative'.\n\n'He slashed and murdered victim in Tennessee with knives,' Sheriff Judd told reporters on Tuesday. He added that after killing the male and female in the Florida home on Sunday, he 'poured bleach on victims, got a mop and bucket and cleaned up'.\n\nSUSPECT'S TIMELINE October 1: Man is stabbed to death at a laundromat in Greeneville, Tennessee where Mossburg lived. October 9: Mossburg steals a vehicle from a lot in Seffner in Hillsborough County, Florida and drives to Winter Garden. After this point he steals another car and travels to Tennessee and Spartanburg, South Carolina where his sister lives. His sister gives him money for a bus to Orlando. He gets to Polk County and allegedly steals a black Ford 250 truck. October 13: Mossburg is seen around 4pm on Ring video at a home connected to the crime scene. The device notified the owner of activity and the owner tells Mossburg to leave, which he does. At 10.30pm the surviving victim, an elderly man, arrived homes where his male and female roommates are tied up. Mossburg kills them both and ties up the live victim overnight. October 14: Mossburg leaves between 12pm and 1pm male in the dead female victim's car, telling the live victim not to call cops. At 6pm, the hostage flees to a neighbor's house and calls police. At 9.10pm police spot the female victim's car and a previously stolen truck at a nearby residence. When they knock at the door they are shot at twice. October 15: A SWAT team attempts entry until 5.10am and are successful using an armored truck via the garage and a K9 dog. Mossburg is taken to hospital and later booked into jail on first-degree murder and attempted murder charges.\n\nMossburg kept the house 'freezing' so the corpses didn't smell and on Tuesday morning and loaded property from the home into the female victim's car, telling the surviving man he will return to 'deal with the bodies' but 'if you leave I'm gonna kill you'.\n\nThe live victim stayed put from around 12pm-1pm but around 6pm ran to a neighbor and dialed 911.\n\nThe sheriff said if it wasn't for colleague spotting the stolen 2013 black Hyundai Tucson two blocks away at around 9.10pm, while patrolling the area, Mossburg may have killed more people.\n\nCops tried to kick down a door to a nearby residence where Mossburg was hiding, where a second vehicle reported stolen was outside, but were shot at twice. A SWAT team tried to talk to Mossburg throughout Monday night from 10.30pm until 5.10am Tuesday, but are shot at again.\n\nEventually they got in using an armored vehicle through the garage and who located the suspect under a pool table, which broke and fell down during the confrontation.\n\nABC News pictured the scene where Mossburg was captured.\n\nMossburg was taken to hospital for dog bites after a K9 was sent in, and he was transferred to County Jail Tuesday morning. He is due to appear for a hearing at 1pm on Wednesday.\n\nIn Polk County, he faces two charges of first-degree murder of the local victims and attempted murder against deputies.\n\n'We hope and pray there are no more victims that he's just bragging,' Sheriff Judd said.\n\nBut Judd asked the public to let them know of any more stolen vehicles in case they were connected to the wanted fugitive from Greeneville, Tennessee.\n\nHe added the majority of Mossburg's 30 charges are non-violent.\n\n'He just likes to steal and use drugs. By the way he's a spree killer but let's not concern ourselves with that,' the Sheriff sarcastically quipped Tuesday morning.\n\n'Legislators, when you start talking about low-level suspects, gag me with a spoon,' Sheriff Judd added.\n\n'When you kill people with a knife, it's up-close, personal, based on anger revenge, evil. He didn't shoot from a distance\u2026 all victims we're aware of had multiple cut wounds as a result of this evil person.'\n\nPolk County Sheriff Grady Judd, said in a press conference Tuesday morning.
