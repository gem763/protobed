There\u2019s deep polarisation in the country,\u201d said Frank Graves, president of the polling company EKOS Research. \u201cOn issues such as climate change, immigration and attitudes towards public institutions, the divisions have never been starker.\u201d\n\nJustin Trudeau seeks to repeat 2015 surge as Canada braces for election Read more\n\nThe upcoming campaign will last nearly six weeks: half the length of the marathon campaign of 2015, when voters endured almost 80 days of mudslinging by political leaders \u2013 a brief dash compared to US elections, but a marathon for Canada.\n\nThe country\u2019s 43rd election also comes against the backdrop of protracted political scandal for the incumbent prime minister.\n\nFor months, Trudeau has faced accusations \u2013 including from the country\u2019s ethics commissioner \u2013 that he acted improperly when he requested his attorney general to halt criminal prosecution of the Quebec-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin.\n\nTrudeau and his Liberals are widely expected to use the election to shore up support for his government\u2019s climate change policies, including a nationwide carbon tax. His main opponent, the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, has pledged to repeal the Liberals\u2019 marquee environmental legislation.\n\nScheer, the youngest federal leader and running in his first federal campaign as head of the party, has consistently used the prime minister\u2019s ethical lapses to paint the government as unable to govern effectively.\n\nPolling suggests Trudeau and Scheer are deadlocked in the popular vote, but the Liberals hold an edge when it comes to winning seats in parliament.\n\nJagmeet Singh, leader of the leftwing New Democratic party, is also running his first federal campaign as a party leader. Despite initial excitement around his role as the first major party leader from a racial minority, the NDP\u2019s finances have collapsed and the party is likely to sustain heavy electoral losses throughout the country. \u201cThey are in danger, if they were to slip any more \u2013 which I would not rule out \u2013 of not forming official party status,\u201d said Graves.\n\nMeanwhile, the Green party, led by Elizabeth May, has experienced a surge in support as the climate crises increasingly rates as an important issues for voters.\n\nThe official start of the campaign comes a day before a highly anticipated leaders\u2019 debate, in which Scheer, Singh and May will spar for the first time on stage. But the televised debate, hosted in Toronto, will have a glaring omission: Trudeau has opted to skip the event, leaving his rivals without a foil.", "description": "Justin Trudeau to request dissolution of parliament and \u2018Divisions have never been starker\u2019 before 21 October polling day", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0edfaca032da7d1bf0a8df82d0318315d807b936/0_57_2060_1236/master/2060.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c379bfc9bcefc84275f47866240e2be8", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
