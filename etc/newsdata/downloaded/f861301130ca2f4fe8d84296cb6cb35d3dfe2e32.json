Quarter-zips! Pullovers! Sweaters! Oh my!\n\nYes, you know the drill, it\u2019s time to break out the flannels and your favorite Patagonia and, listen, I\u2019m on board with all of that. But let\u2019s take your fall wardrobe a little further, or shall I say a little longer, with one more essential item: the turtleneck.\n\nThe turtleneck is a very contested article of clothing. It often does not invoke fond memories. It\u2019s the thing your parents forced you to wear on holidays, causing you to spend the entirety of Thanksgiving dinner scratching your neck. I have learned through many passionate turtleneck debates that it\u2019s very difficult to convince people who don\u2019t like things touching their neck to sport one. But if you are an anti-turtlenecker, let me tell you one more time about all the wondrous things a turtleneck has to offer.\n\nFirst and foremost they\u2019re cozy, which is what we\u2019re all obviously looking for in a fall wardrobe. You also have your choice in a variety of fabrics and styles for various occasions. You have your thinner, slimmer turtlenecks \u2014 good for layering and atypical October weather, and then your thicker cable-knit turtlenecks for November.\n\nBut most importantly, the turtleneck is sexy, which I\u2019m sure sounds like an oxymoron. It\u2019s less ooo what\u2019s under that cashmere and more English Professor let\u2019s discuss Proust while we walk through the courtyard as the crisp, colorful autumn leaves fall around us vibe (preferably without all the mansplaining, but that\u2019s a choice unto you). The turtleneck simply invokes a sophisticated, smart style and transforms pretty much any outfit without much work on your part. All you really have to do now is get over your fear of fabric hugging your neck.\n\n\n\nUniqlo Extra Fine Merino Turtleneck Long-Sleeve Sweater\n\nIf you can only indulge in one kind of turtleneck, make it a black one.\n\nH&M Ribbed Turtleneck Shirt\n\nMy personal favorite turtleneck color \u2014 and this comfy ribbed stretch cotton neck jersey is primed for layering.\n\nTodd Snyder Cashmere Turtleneck in Chestnut\n\nIf a pumpkin spiced latte could wear a turtleneck I assume it would be this one. A more sophisticated staple in a delicious fall color. Plus the mid-weight cashmere will keep you cozy without looking bulky.\n\nJ.Crew Unisex 1988 Cotton Rollneck\u2122 Sweater\n\nIf you really can\u2019t deal with the neck-hugging, try J.Crew\u2019s iconic cotton rollneck sweater. While it\u2019s only half a turtleneck, it\u2019s still got full turtleneck vibes.\n\nHowlin\u2019 Burgundy Sylvester Slim-Fit Wool Rollneck Sweater\n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019ll look like Colin Firth in this, but you might look like Colin Firth in this.", "description": "The turtleneck is a hotly contested article of men's clothing, but only among men.
