Wichmann, chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on strong third quarter 2019 results and its positive view for the rest of the year, the Company increased its full year net earnings outlook to $14.15 to $14.25 per share and adjusted net earnings to a range of $14.90 to $15.00 per share, both increasing $0.15 per share at the mid-point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarterly Financial Performance Three Months Ended September 30, September 30, June 30, 2019 2018 2019 Revenues $60.4 billion $56.6 billion $60.6 billion Earnings From Operations $5.0 billion $4.6 billion $4.7 billion Net Margin 5.9% 5.6% 5.4%\n\n\u2022 UnitedHealth Group\u2019s third quarter 2019 revenues grew $3.8 billion or 6.7 percent year-over-year to $60.4 billion, led by double-digit percentage revenue growth for Optum. Year-to-date revenues grew 8 percent or $13.4 billion to $181.3 billion year-over-year.\n\n\u2022 Third quarter earnings from operations grew $424 million year-over-year or 9.2 percent to $5.0 billion led by double-digit growth rates across each of the Optum businesses. Adjusted net earnings of $3.88 per share increased 13.8 percent, bringing year-to-date adjusted net earnings per share to $11.22, a 16.9 percent growth rate year-over-year.\n\n\u2022 Cash flows from operations were $3.2 billion in the quarter and $12.3 billion or 1.2x net income year-to-date.\n\n\u2022 Third quarter medical cost trends remained in line with expectations, with the health insurance tax deferral driving the 140 basis point year-over-year increase in the medical care ratio to 82.4 percent. Favorable medical reserve development was $140 million in the quarter, with $80 million related to 2019 and $60 million related to prior periods. Days claims payable of 49.3 days compared to 48.6 in the second quarter 2019 and 50.5 in the third quarter 2018.\n\n\u2022 The third quarter operating cost ratio improved 20 basis points from the same period last year to 14.8 percent, reflecting the deferral of the health insurance tax and continued effects of operating cost productivity improvements, net of the effect of business mix changes and continued investments in innovation, service and growth.\n\n\u2022 Third quarter dividends of $1.08 per share increased 20 percent year-over-year to $1 billion. The Company repurchased 2.6 million shares for $600 million in the quarter, bringing year-to-date purchases to 20.8 million shares for $5.1 billion.\n\n\u2022 Return on equity of 26.2 percent in the period continued to reflect the Company\u2019s efficient capital base and strong earnings profile.\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare provides health care benefits globally, serving individuals and employers, and Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. UnitedHealthcare is dedicated to improving the value health care consumers receive by reducing the total cost of care, enhancing the quality of care received, improving health and wellness and simplifying the health care experience.\n\nQuarterly Financial Performance Three Months Ended September 30, September 30, June 30, 2019 2018 2019 Revenues $48.1 billion $45.9 billion $48.6 billion Earnings From Operations $2.7 billion $2.6 billion $2.6 billion Operating Margin 5.5% 5.6% 5.4%\n\n\u2022 UnitedHealthcare grew to serve 415,000 more people with medical benefits over the past year driven by growth in commercial and Medicare Advantage membership, and with greater focus on serving people with higher acuity needs. This led to revenue growth of 4.7 percent, or $2.2 billion, to $48.1 billion in the quarter. Third quarter 2019 earnings from operations at UnitedHealthcare grew by 3.8 percent to $2.7 billion driven by revenue growth and strong cost disciplines, offset by an extra day in the quarter and the impact of the health insurance tax deferral. Year-to-date, earnings from operations grew 13 percent.\n\n\u2013 Third quarter 2019 revenues at UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual grew $557 million year-over-year to $14.3 billion, as UnitedHealthcare served just over 1 million more people with commercial benefits in the past year.\n\n\u2013 UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement third quarter 2019 revenues advanced by 10.2 percent or $1.9 billion to $20.7 billion.

OptumHealth served approximately 95 million people at September 30, 2019, as revenue per consumer increased 30 percent year-over-year, driven by growth in value-based care arrangements and expanded local care delivery offerings.\n\n\u2013 Third quarter 2019 revenues at OptumInsight grew 16.1 percent year-over-year to $2.6 billion, while revenue backlog advanced 21 percent year-over-year to $19.0 billion at quarter-end.\n\n\u2013 OptumRx revenues in third quarter 2019 of $18.5 billion increased 5.8 percent or $1.0 billion year-over-year, reflecting continued diversification to more clinically focused services, including specialty pharmacy care. In the third quarter 2019 OptumRx fulfilled 325 million adjusted scripts or a decline of 2 percent over the prior year, impacted by the one previously announced large client transition.\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 4 of 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout UnitedHealth Group\n\nUnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone.

Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted net earnings per share excludes from the relevant GAAP metric, as applicable, intangible amortization and other items, if any, that do not relate to the Company's underlying business performance. Management believes that the use of adjusted net earnings per share provides investors and management useful information about the earnings impact of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. As amortization fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company\u2019s acquisition activity, management believes this exclusion provides a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance and trends from period to period. While intangible assets contribute to the Company\u2019s revenue generation, the intangible amortization is not directly related. Therefore, the related revenues are included in adjusted earnings per share.\n\n\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/731766/000073176619000031/uhglogo1a02a01a01a01a28.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
