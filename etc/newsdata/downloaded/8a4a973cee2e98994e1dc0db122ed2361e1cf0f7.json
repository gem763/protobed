The so-called Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System was also implicated in the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max in March that claimed 157 lives.\n\n\u201cOnly after the tragedy in Ethiopia, they concluded that it\u2019s Boeing\u2019s fault. Why didn\u2019t they say it in the first place?\u201d said Evi Samsul Komar, whose 24-year-old son died in the Oct. 29 Lion Air crash. \u201cUp until now, we never been contacted by Boeing,\u201d he said after the briefing in Jakarta.\n\nIndonesian investigators are due to publish their final report on the crash at 2 p.m. local time Friday. The findings could influence regulators worldwide as they assess the fate of what was Boeing\u2019s best-selling plane, which has been grounded globally since March 13, costing the company over $8 billion. The head of its jetliner division stepped down Tuesday after less than three years in the job.\n\nThe 737 Max\u2019s MCAS feature, which automatically pushes the plane\u2019s nose downward if it detects danger of an aerodynamic stall, has long been in focus in investigations into the two crashes. In its slideshow Wednesday, the NTSC said the system was too reliant on a single angle-of-attack sensor, making it vulnerable if that sensor malfunctioned and transmitted erroneous readings.\n\nThe government agency said a lack of guidance around MCAS made it harder for crews to respond to automated actions by the system. It also said that a replacement sensor on the doomed Lion Air plane wasn\u2019t properly calibrated during an earlier repair, and that this error hadn\u2019t been detected. A lack of documentation made it more difficult for maintenance and accident crews to take appropriate actions, a slide showed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with the briefing and the explanation but this is the result,\u201d said Komar, who was accompanied by his wife and broke down in tears while speaking to reporters.\n\nLion Air and the country\u2019s civil aviation authority recently objected to findings in a draft of the final report because on grounds they received too much of the blame, people familiar with the matter said last month. One of the people said at the time that 25 of 41 lapses were directed toward the airline.\n\nThe findings presented Wednesday suggest a problem with the plane\u2019s design rather than a software issue, said Satyendra Pandey, a New Delhi-based independent analyst and former head of strategy at Go Airlines India Ltd.\n\n\u201cGoing back to revisit the design itself has tremendous ramifications for Boeing \u2014 both in terms of cost and liability,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be assumed that Boeing will contest this and point to software as the flaw.\u201d\n\nA Boeing representative wrote in an email that it was too premature to comment on the report as it hasn\u2019t been officially released by Indonesian investigators. Lion Air didn\u2019t immediately respond to calls seeking comments.\n\nRecently published messages between two senior Boeing test pilots showed they had misgivings about the MCAS on 737 Max jets during its certification in 2016, with one describing its handling performance as egregious.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which has faced criticism for approving the feature and giving Boeing too much authority to oversee itself, said Friday that it was concerned by comments in the messages between the two pilots and chastised Boeing for not sharing the information sooner. Boeing said it told regulators it had expanded the role of the flight-control software.\n\n\u201cAs we have suspected since the very beginning, the accident was caused by these two institutions, Boeing and FAA,\u201d said Latief Nurbana, whose 24-year-old son died in the Lion Air crash. \u201cFAA shares the blame as the certification process was not conducted thoroughly.\u201d\n\nProblems with the three-month-old Lion Air jet\u2019s sensors had been reported on three previous flights, including one made from Bali the day before the crash. In that instance, an off-duty pilot traveling in the cockpit identified the problem and told the crew how to disable the malfunctioning control system. However, the pilots didn\u2019t report key issues with the flight after they landed.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Design flaws in Boeing Co.\u2019s 737 Max and a lack of information for pilots on how to deal with malfunctions contributed to last year\u2019s crash of Lion Air Flight 610, which killed 189 people, Indonesian investigators found.In a nine-point presentation to victims\u2019 families, the National Transportation", "authors": ["Harry Suhartono", "Fathiya Dahrul", "Anurag Kotoky"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PLaZ_2gLCtujvSEvETdUxQ--~B/aD05NjY7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/de0c6b3448b1ddbc3429e5d3dac5e8c8", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
