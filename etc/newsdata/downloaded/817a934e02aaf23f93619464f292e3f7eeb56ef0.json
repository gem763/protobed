It took an average of these new customer prices from across the last three months (July, August, September) to get a fair representation of these new prices.\n\nThe two datasets were then compared to find how much customers are overpaying.\n\nIs My Bill Fair's research found that BT customers were overcharged the most at \u00a319.63 per month, affecting 86 per cent of customers.\n\nA BT spokesperson said: 'At BT we believe that all customers should get the right products and services for them for a fair price. Our more than one million BT Plus customers pay the same price whether they're in or out of contract; we froze prices for broadband, landline and mobile customers for 2019; and we were the first provider to link future price changes to CPI to be clearer and more predictable.\n\n'We're doing more than ever to make sure that BT customers who may be vulnerable are getting the service that's right for them. We're continuing to work closely with Ofcom to help maintain a dynamic market where customers get great value and choice, and we'll be announcing more for our customers in the coming months.'\n\nHOW MUCH BROADBAND CUSTOMERS ARE BEING OVERCHARGED Broadband providers Average overcharge per month Percentage of customers overcharged BT \u00a319.63 86% Sky \u00a317.80 77% Virgin Media \u00a315.13 77% TalkTalk \u00a310.66 79% Plusnet \u00a310.11 87% EE \u00a37.60 66% Source: Is My Bill Fair\n\nSky were also revealed to be overcharging their loyal customers by \u00a317.80 per month, affecting 77 per cent of consumers.\n\nAnother 77 per cent of customers were affected by Virgin Media who was also found to overcharge customers by \u00a315.13 a month.\n\nTalkTalk customers were found to overpay by \u00a310.66 a month, affecting 79 per cent of customers whilst Plusnet customers were overcharged by \u00a310.11 a month, affecting some 87 per cent of customers.\n\nEE customers were the least affected with 66 per cent being overcharged \u00a37.60 a month.\n\nAlex Perrin, CEO of check and challenge website Is My Bill Fair, said: 'We can't deny the fact that regulatory bodies are attempting to help customers lower their bills by kicking off the super complaint last year. But trying to make providers do the right thing is a very long and slow process. In fact, 12 months on and nothing has changed.\n\n'While this rumbles on, consumers are still being hit in the pocket and paying \u00a33billion more than they should for their broadband services. Just to add further insult to injury, providers continue to put prices up for existing loyal customers with Virgin Media implementing hikes of almost 5 per cent this month.'\n\nOfcom is introducing new measures to help curb customers overpaying on their broadband\n\nOfcom's new measures\n\nSomewhat different to Is My Bill Fair's figures, research by Ofcom of 20million broadband customers, found that around 40 per cent of broadband customers \u2013 equivalent to 8.8million people - are out of contract.\n\nIn a bid to tackle the loyalty penalty it has set out a series of new measures to help ensure out of contract broadband customers will pay fairer prices and vulnerable customers will receive better protection from providers.\n\nSome of the UK's biggest broadband providers, including BT, Sky and TalkTalk, have agreed to proposed new guidelines from the watchdog which include allowing out of contract customers to get the same deals as new customers when they take out a new contract.\n\nMost of the new measures will be in effect by March 2020.\n\nRichard Neudegg, head of regulation at uSwitch, said: 'It is understandably frustrating for households that are out of contract to be paying more each year for their broadband than those who shop around.\n\n'While it is reassuring to hear that many of the providers have committed to ensuring existing customers can access the same deals as new customers, the truth is that it comes as no surprise that loyalty doesn't pay.\n\n'If consumers want the best deals available, the onus will always be on them to run a comparison and see what other offers are out there or at the very least pick up the phone and speak to their existing provider.'\n\nWhat is the super complaint?\n\nCitizens Advice super complaint addressed the issue of the loyalty penalty with the charity calling on the Competition and Markets Authority to tackle the problem and stop consumers being ripped off after finding loyal customers were being penalised \u00a34.1billion a year.\n\nBroadband is just one element of the super complaint which also explores mobile, home insurance, mortgages and savings.\n\nSpecific issues relating to the broadband loyalty penalty include the fact that the cost of broadband after the initial contract ends is rarely included in advertising and is hard to find on provider's websites as well as exposing how vulnerable customers are more likely to be stung by the loyalty penalty.\n\nGillian Guy, Chief Executive of Citizens Advice, said: 'A year ago we submitted a super-complaint after finding that customers were being penalised by over \u00a34billion a year simply for being loyal to their provider.\n\n'Everyone from government to regulators have talked about how the loyalty penalty is unacceptable, but progress has been slow and inconsistent. This isn't good enough.\n\n'Ofcom has started to make progress in the mobile and broadband markets, but it must make all providers stamp out the loyalty penalty.\n\n'In the savings, mortgage and insurance markets we haven't seen any concrete action from the FCA. Time is running out.\n\n'Unless significant progress is made across the board in the next three months, the only realistic option will be for the CMA to carry out a market study to stop companies charging the loyalty penalty once and for all.'", "description": "BT customers have been stung the most with nine out of ten paying \u00a3236 more than they should for the service they receive, according to data from check and challenger website, Is My Bill Fair.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
