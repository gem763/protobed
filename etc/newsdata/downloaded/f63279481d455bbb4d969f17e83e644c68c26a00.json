Samsung only sold 700,000 units of its smartphones in China during the second quarter of this year, according to a local report in August.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "Samsung acknowledged the security flaw last week.", "authors": ["Cyrus Lee"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/01/fed8e131-a8f2-4a9c-b744-61e589e3326d/thumbnail/770x578/af3e199684af9ba0f52abd45b3565e9d/samsung-galaxy-s10.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
