She had just produced the second fastest 1,500 metres of her life, and yet she could finish only fifth, courtesy of an astounding gold-medal run by Holland\u2019s Sifan Hassan, formerly coached by Alberto Salazar, who has just been thrown out of the sport for four years for multiple doping violations.\n\nHassan, already the champion over 10,000m, stopped the clock at three minutes 51.95 seconds, confirming her as the event\u2019s sixth quickest woman in history. In the circumstances, it was not a result that Muir appeared ready to accept at face value. \u201cGiven the news of the past couple of days, I think there is a cloud,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no avoiding that.\u201d\n\nIn a gripping final, Hassan hit the front early and never looked back, streaking to a time that catapulted her up the all-time list. She now lies behind only Genzebe Dibaba, the Ethiopian mentored by the controversial Jama Aden, and four Chinese runners who flourished in the mid-Nineties under the tutelage of Ma Junren, who employed often extreme methods.\n\nHassan has been an astounding force at these championships. En route to gold in the 10,000m, she covered the final 1,500 in under four minutes, better than many of her opponents last night managed for that distance alone. But her moments of triumph have been engulfed by the scandal around Salazar, her coach at the Nike Oregon Project. When she joined Salazar in the wake of the Rio Olympics, her manager, Jos Hermens, had insisted that she was in \u201cgood, safe, clean hands\u201d, but this week the American was banned for administering banned substances and tampering with the doping system.", "description": "Laura Muir was not in the mood for diplomacy.", "authors": ["Oliver Brown", "Chief Sports Feature Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/athletics/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000212117299-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7DDeHPlGHT0xOyRx1qxB6to.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
