The game has 8 million peak concurrent viewers logging in every day, according to September statistics from developer Riot Games, and was deemed the most viewed title on Twitch in the first half of 2019 \u2013 surpassing even Fortnite.\n\nSomeone who has seen this rise first-hand is Sjokz. After gaining notoriety on YouTube show Whose League Is It Anyway?, she was hired as the host of the European League Of Legends Championship Series in 2013. Today, she\u2019s one of the most recognisable faces in the League Of Legends scene and won Best Esports Host at last year\u2019s The Game Awards.\n\nBorn in Belgium, the nickname \u2018Sjokz\u2019 derives from her favourite weapon, the shock rifle, when she played Unreal Tournament competitively. Despite growing up playing games, and getting involved as a professional player, her journey into esports broadcasting was largely a happy accident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I started gaming when I was pretty young, like 12 or 13-years-old, so it was something I always interested in,\u2019 Sjokz tells GameCentral. \u2018In that sense I\u2019m really happy I got to make it my job, but it wasn\u2019t that straight-forward.\n\n\u2018As you can imagine 20 years ago, my parents and my friends were like, \u201cWhat are you doing? Why are you playing games all the time?\u201d But I still pursued it after university and I just kind of rolled into it. Esports completely exploded and grew very, very fast, and I was lucky enough to be a part of it.\u2019\n\nThe League Of Legends World Championship Finals in South Korea last year (Picture: Jean Chung/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nNow aged 32, Sjokz names her hosting career highlight as the 2013 League Of Legends World Championship at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles \u2013 a watershed moment where viewers from the previous year ballooned from 8.2 million to 32 million on Twitch. For Sjokz, she was faced with 12,000 screaming fans in the arena. \u2018That was definitely a moment of holy sh*t,\u2019 she says.\n\nAchieving fame in the League Of Legends scene, however, might be seen as a double-edged sword. The game has a long-standing reputation for toxicity among its community, something Riot has tried to control with honour systems to help welcome beginner players. Having been ingrained in the community from the beginning, however, Sjokz has acclimatised to fame alongside its growth as an esport.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s pretty crazy sometimes to think about it. I was just in Japan and people were asking for autographs and I said, \u201cWhat is this life? What is going on?\u201d But I think for me I adjusted to it follower per follower,\u2019 Sjokz says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When I started out there were 200 people following and 2,000 people watching, and the next year it was triple that, quadruple that, so I got to adjust to it step by step. I think it might be more difficult for people who jump into it now and they\u2019re immediately exposed to millions of people. It\u2019s gone step by step [for me] but that doesn\u2019t make it less intense sometimes.\u2019\n\nThe League Of Legends World Championships 2019 takes place on 10 November in Paris; the next host city of the Olympics after Tokyo 2020. There\u2019s been speculation over whether esports could be introduced as an Olympic sport by 2024, although issues like video game violence, broadcast licensing, and the lack of an international governing body are all major hurdles. President of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, previously cast doubt on its chances, branding \u2018killer games\u2019 as \u2018contradictory to Olympic values\u2019.\n\nCasters Eefje \u2018Sjokz\u2019 Depoortere, Andy \u2018Vedius\u2019 Day and Jonas \u2018Kold\u2019 Andersen during LCS EU semi final match of Summer Split 2018 (Picture: BorjaB.Hojas/COOLMedia/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nThere\u2019s still promising signs though. Esports was featured in the 2018 Asian Games in Indonesia for the first time, while Tokyo is hosting special tournaments for Street Fighter V and Rocket League ahead of the 2020 Olympics in July. Recognition from the Olympics is perceived as a goal to legitimising esports as a \u2018sport\u2019 to the masses, although Sjokz doesn\u2019t believe the industry necessarily needs their badge of approval.\n\n\u2018From my personal standpoint, I couldn\u2019t care less if esports was in the dictionary next to \u201csports\u201d,\u2019 Sjokz says. \u2018To me it doesn\u2019t matter because esports is awesome the way it is and it is a high level of competition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I get that because it\u2019s so relatively new, it\u2019s something that\u2019s hard for people to wrap their heads around and understand. So I don\u2019t mind the conversation being brought up because that\u2019s also what gets more mainstream attention.\n\n\u2018But I think if you look at esports independently, it is super successful, lots of sponsorships, fantastic tournaments, super passionate fandom. It\u2019s going well regardless of it being considered a \u201csport\u201d by, I would say, more older people perhaps. I think we\u2019re doing fine regardless.\u2019\n\nAsked if she\u2019d like to host Olympic coverage if esports was included, Sjokz said: \u2018I do think it\u2019s important for the political side of things, visas for athletes and financials and all that. I would love to be a part of it, anything to show people how cool this is on a big scale.\u2019\n\nWhile there\u2019s an expectation League Of Legends will eventually be superseded as the top esport, Riot have started laying the groundwork to expand the game\u2019s legacy. The developer recently announced a batch of new spin-offs, including a fighting game, digital card game, and an animated series all set within the same universe.\n\nAsked about why she thinks League has lasted for so long, Sjokz puts it down to the core gameplay and the escalating competition from all over the world.\n\n\u2018When we look back at the beginning I think it\u2019s just a really fun game and it was free to play, so it\u2019s very accessible for everyone. Secondly, I think Riot from the start invested a lot into making esports grow and attracted a lot of people who used to work on traditional sports shows like the Olympics. From very early, [they put] a lot of weight into the esports scene because obviously it brings a lot of attention back to the game.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It has just evolved over the years and never really gotten stale or boring and the championships have only gotten more interesting, especially in the last couple of years\u2019, she adds. \u2018After Korean domination for years, the West has risen up also, so I think a lot of those factors are helping.\u2019\n\nDuring the timespan she\u2019s been presenting, the casting profession has become a viable career path many fans aspire towards \u2013 but what advice would Sjokz give to newcomers?\n\n\u2018In general, just put yourself out there,\u2019 she adds. \u2018There\u2019s so many ways now. I think esports is really unique and in general things are very intertwined with social media that you can get your face and your brand out there very easily. So I would recommend people just do that.\n\n\u2018Go interact with the community. There\u2019s so many esports and esports show being developed all the time that you can definitely get a chance. Just put yourself out there.\u2019\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.", "description": "GameCentral speaks to League Of Legends esports caster Sjokz about dealing with fame and why she doesn't care about the 'sport' label.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MR_191004_PlayerOne_Sjokz_0010-4707_1571824077.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
