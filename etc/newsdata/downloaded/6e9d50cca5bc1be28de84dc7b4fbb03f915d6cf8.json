His family plans to live on the second floor until he can make repairs, which he reckons could take three months\n\nSurvivors in Fukushima described how water rose rapidly to chest-height in about an hour, making it hard to escape to higher ground.\n\n\"Nobody from city hall has come to check on us yet,\" Yoshinagi Higuchi said on Tuesday, as he and his neighbours piled sodden tatami mats and other damaged furniture onto the street.\n\nMeanwhile, an evacuation centre came under intense criticism after it turned away two homeless men seeking shelter from a typhoon.\n\nShinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, promised on Tuesday to take action after reports emerged of the two men being denied entry to the shelter in Taito ward in the capital, Tokyo.\n\nA 64-year-old homeless man told Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper that he arrived at the Taito evacuation centre on Saturday morning.\n\n\"The wind was strong and it was raining and I wanted them to let me in,\" he said.\n\nOfficials asked him to write down his name and address.\n\nWhen he said he had an address in the northern island of Hokkaido, he was refused entry because he was not a resident of the ward and ended up spending the night taking cover under the eaves of a building.\n\nAbe earlier said the government would set aside 710 million yen ($6.5m) for disaster relief. He has also proposed using 500 billion yen ($4.6bn) in reserves for the long-term recovery effort.\n\n\"It's important to make sure the storm-hit municipalities have enough funds to rebuild their communities,\" he was quoted as saying by NHK.", "description": "At least 12 remain missing after deadly Typhoon Hagibis, which left as many as 13,000 homes flooded in 13 prefectures.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/a64da863faad48c5b980bd298f9001f3_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
