If Prime Minister Boris Johnson is forced to request another extension from the EU later this month, he will go to the polls facing a fired up Nigel Farage ready to accuse him of selling out the Brexiteers and failing to deliver his signature promise of leaving by Halloween.\n\nThe fallout could be devastating for the Conservative Party, and for Brexit.\n\nIf a significant chunk of the Tory vote sides with the radical forces of the Brexit Party, that could allow a rainbow coalition of anti-Brexit parties to secure a majority in Parliament. With Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and the nationalist parties from Scotland and Wales in control of events, a second referendum that could cancel Brexit would become all but inevitable.\n\nThat\u2019s why Johnson uttered the phrase \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by Oct. 31 no fewer than eight times during his first speech as leader to the annual party conference in Manchester on Wednesday. If he secures Brexit first, polls and seat analysis suggest he would sweep to victory in an election.\n\nUnfortunately for Johnson, European Union officials are pouring cold water on the chances of a deal this month and Britain\u2019s Parliament has passed a law preventing him from forcing the country out without one.\n\nJohnson is backed into a corner and looking at increasingly unlikely solutions to escape. His premiership depends on it, and he is still almost two months short of avoiding a place in the history books as Britain\u2019s shortest serving prime minister.\n\nDrumbeat\n\nOn the eve of the Conservative Party conference last Friday, the hardline forces of Brexit gathered in central London to remind Johnson just how much pressure he is under from the right. Before an electrified crowd in Westminster, Farage taunted Johnson, who had tried to \u201cout-Brexit the Brexit Party\u201d in the belief that traditional Conservative voters would return to base.\n\n\u201cBut here we are!\u201d Farage bellowed. \u201cThe reason Brexit Party voters are not going to go back en masse is very simple\u2014we just don\u2019t trust the Conservative Party!\u201d\n\nThe problem was exemplified by one of Johnson\u2019s former Conservative colleagues who was also on stage. Ann Widdecombe was a high-profile Conservative lawmaker for more than 20 years, but earlier this year she was elected as a member of the European Parliament for the Brexit Party during the stunning May elections in which the Euroskeptic party finished in first place\u2014and the Conservatives fell back into fifth.\n\nShe sent the crowd into raptures by threatening to repeat the trick at the coming election unless Johnson secures a hard Brexit by Oct. 31. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, then he is going to find that the next general election for him will be like leading the charge of the Light Brigade,\u201d she warned, recasting Lord Tennyson\u2019s epic poem about a disastrous cavalry charge.\n\nBrexit to right of him, Brexit to left of him, Brexit in front of him, Volleying and thundering...\n\nThe next line was drowned out by cheers, but Johnson is well aware of his predicament. When asked his week on the BBC about allegations of sexual misconduct, the prime minister invoked the very next line himself: \u201cStormed at with shot and shell.\u201d\n\nBackstage, Widdecombe explained that Johnson was partly to blame for the position he\u2019s found himself in. He made a \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to deliver Brexit by Halloween during the leadership race that saw him succeed Theresa May in July, and he\u2019s spent the last three months repeating the date over and over.\n\n\u201cIf he asks for an extension, his standing would collapse completely,\u201d Widdecombe told The Daily Beast. \u201cHe\u2019s invested a huge amount of personal capital in this, he really has.\u201d\n\nThe Brexit Party has made it clear that it would back Johnson, and even form an electoral pact, if he commits to a \u201cNo Deal\u201d Brexit, which would instantly withdraw Britain from all of the institutions, trade deals, and reciprocal arrangements of the EU. Critics of this position point out that Britain would immediately have to begin negotiating its way back into similar relationships\u2014from a position of weakness as the domestic economy readjusts.\n\nNo. 10, which is now staffed by a host of Vote Leavers brought in as Johnson got the old Brexit team back together again, has rejected any suggestion of striking a deal with the Brexit Party. Farage and his acolytes were members of the rival Brexit group Leave.EU during the referendum and the acrimony between the two factions has shown little sign of easing. A Johnson spokesman said last month that Farage and Arron Banks, who bankrolled Leave.EU, were not \u201cfit and proper persons and they should never be allowed anywhere near government.\u201d\n\nRichard Tice, the chairman of the Brexit Party, told The Daily Beast that Johnson would soon have to reconsider: \u201cHe\u2019s doomed, he\u2019ll be begging for our support.\u201d\n\nBy Any Means Necessary\n\nA few days later in the hubbub of the luxe Midland Hotel lobby in Manchester, lawmakers gathered during Conservative Party conference to sip $17 gin and tonics with party members and business leaders in expensive suits. Dominic Cummings shambled out of a side door and marched across the room in a crumpled shirt and three-stripe hoodie.\n\nThis is not Cummings\u2019 world. The cutthroat Vote Leave alum will never fit in with the rest of his party, and yet this is the man entrusted by Johnson to lead his strategy at one of the most contentious moments in British political history.\n\nSo long as you don\u2019t intend to quote them, party members, officials and lawmakers are all too happy to denigrate his plan and cast doubt on whether his huge gamble will come off.\n\nHis aggressive, non-consensual pursuit of Brexit is regarded as \u201creckless\u201d by party insiders who fear for their prospects at the election, which looms menacingly over conference, if Johnson fails to secure a deal.\n\nEven a local politician wearing a \u201cBoris Boris Boris\u201d T-shirt admitted that the prime minister\u2019s unswerving promise to deliver Brexit by the end of the month was \u201cunnecessary.\u201d\n\n\u201c If we kick the can down the road, we kick the bucket. \u201d \u2014 Mark Francois, Conservative lawmaker\n\nJohnson and his Downing Street team are well aware of the potential fallout from failing to deliver. They shut down Parliament last month in order to prevent lawmakers from coming up with a legally binding way to stop them from forcing through a \u201cNo Deal.\u201d\n\nThe supreme court ruled that it had been unlawful to ask the Queen to \u201cprorogue\u201d Parliament in this way, but No. 10 had been too slow in any case, and lawmakers passed a bill to force Johnson to seek an extension unless a deal is reached with the EU for an orderly exit.\n\nThe author of that bill, Hilary Benn, told The Daily Beast last week that Johnson would not be able to find a way around that legislation because the courts would step in to halt his plans for the second time in a few weeks.\n\nIf he were to try another controversial maneuver, Johnson is also likely to come up against what President Trump would call \u201cthe deep state.\u201d The head of Britain\u2019s civil service union, the FDA, explained in Manchester this week that independent administration officials would refuse to go along with a Johnson plot to force through a \u201cNo Deal\u201d Brexit if they believed that would mean breaking the law. \u201cIf we end up in a situation where genuinely a civil servant thinks they\u2019ve been asked to break the law and they\u2019ve received instruction on that, I think we will see people refusing to do that,\u201d said Dave Penman.\n\nJohnson and his allies have continued to hint darkly that they will find a way to get around the clearly expressed will of Parliament if they don\u2019t get their way.\n\nThat may be the case, or it may simply be an act of political theater. If Johnson is forced to accept another Brexit extension, he\u2019s going to need the spin operation of his life to convince skeptical Brexiteers not to blame him.\n\nLeave Means Leave\n\nThe \u201cout-Brexiting the Brexit Party\u201d plan is designed with one target in mind: There are more than 100 leave-voting seats, mainly in the Midlands and the North, that are held by the Labour party. With some refocusing of the party platform to bolster public spending and reinforce law and order, Johnson thinks he can turn a swath of them blue for the first time since the Second World War.\n\nBy taking a more extreme position on Brexit than May\u2019s administration, the Conservatives have potentially chosen to sacrifice Remain-leaning seats in London, the South, and Scotland, which they are likely to lose to Labour or the Lib Dems, in favor of sweeping the North.\n\nIf things go their way, the Brexit Party could even help them in traditional Labour areas where Leave voters want to avoid Labour\u2019s promise of a second referendum but couldn\u2019t stand to vote for the Conservatives. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it, in Labour-held seats where there\u2019s a Leave majority the Brexit Party will do very well,\u201d Brexit campaigner Kate Hoey, who has been a Labour lawmaker for 30 years, told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt will cause Labour a major problem.\u201d\n\nMatthew Goodwin, an academic and author of National Populism, sounded a note of caution to Conservatives over this strategy at a fringe event in Manchester. He reminded delegates that May had essentially made a similar play at the last election, one year after the Brexit referendum, by appealing to the economic concerns of Labour leavers and hoping to sweep up Brexit voters. \u201cIt\u2019s worth remembering the 2017 campaign: How many pro-Brexit Labour seats did Theresa May win in the end?\u201d he asked. \u201cSix.\u201d\n\nAndrew Hawkins, a pollster at ComRes, said they had modeled three likely election scenarios based on their most recent five or six polls. The model suggests that if Brexit is in sight by polling day, the Conservatives will be the largest party, and if Brexit had already been secured, Johnson would romp home with a huge majority of 100-plus.\n\nIf an extension is granted, however, the picture is totally different, with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour becoming the largest party. That would put Brexit in jeopardy, as the party has pledged to hold a second referendum within six months of being elected after it has negotiated a new, softer deal with Brussels.\n\nAfter a meeting of hardline Brexiteers at Manchester\u2019s Comedy Store this week, one particularly fervent heckler demonstrated the strength of feeling as she beseeched Owen Patterson, a member of the Conservative\u2019s pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), to make sure Brexit was secured this month. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll shove you down them stairs,\u201d she told the surprised lawmaker.\n\nWith tempers running high, Mark Francois, deputy chairman of the ERG, told The Daily Beast that the Conservatives had no choice: \u201cIf we kick the can down the road, we kick the bucket.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson has failed to secure an election before the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, which sets him up for a bitter fight against his fellow Brexiteers.", "authors": ["Nico Hines", "London Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570098217/191002-Hines-Johnson-Farage-tease_onxceq", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
