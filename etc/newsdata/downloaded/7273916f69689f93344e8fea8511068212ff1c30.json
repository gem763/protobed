Walmart, for example, is introducing an automated process for unloading shipments in more than 1,000 stores, among other improvements.\n\nAt the world's largest retailer, store associates are the first to interact with advanced technology that's gradually implemented in brick-and-mortar locations. Their experience with that tech, both positive and negative, is a crucial part of the rollout strategy \u2014 and it's an indicator of the critical role people still play in the road to automation.\n\nMost feedback from employees arrives once an upgrade has been introduced in 350 stores, according to John Crecelius, Walmart's senior vice president of central operations.\n\n\"At that point you are sort of getting to scale,\" Crecelius told Business Insider. \"What always surprises us and shouldn't anymore is how quickly our associates look at that information and start coming up with 10 to 15 other ideas that we should start going after.\"\n\nA 15-year Walmart veteran, Crecelius has had a front-row seat to some of the retailer's biggest technology leaps. He now oversees the rollout of advanced applications like cameras that monitor self-checkouts for theft in Walmart's more than 4,100 US locations.\n\nHe told Business Insider that Walmart maintained a detailed three-year execution road map for upgrading stores. It prioritizes tasks based on the speed with which the company can complete them. Ideas from associates that show promise are then added to that plan.\n\nWhile some initiatives can be finished quickly, others take years. One employee, for example, analyzed the output data from Walmart's Fast Unloader \u2014 the automated system that unloads delivery trucks \u2014 from another store and realized it could improve operations at their location as well. The company then moved quickly to add the technology to that employee's store.\n\n\"We have to be the most deliberate about taking a lot of feedback and prioritizing it based upon how it impacts our stores and our associates,\" Crecelius said. \"The effort can be quite large on some of these ideas, depending on what it is, and might take longer to get done.\"\n\nHe added that, though a tech push has been a big part of Walmart's mission since he joined the company, the availability and speed with which new innovations are coming to market are creating a different revolution.\n\nThe company, for example, gives its store associates smartphone equivalents (known as the TC40 and MC70) that allow them to communicate with other employees, check their schedules, and locate inventory all from the store floor. In the middle of rolling out an updated version of that device, Walmart is already thinking about the next iteration that will be \"cheaper and faster,\" he said.\n\n\"How connected our associates are to the customers and the information is very different,\" Crecelius said. \"The speed of how fast those devices are changing; we don't see that getting slower.\"", "description": "The launch of new advanced tech typically spurs up to 15 new ideas from store associates, according to Walmart's senior vice president John Crecelius.", "authors": ["Joe Williams"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d66c16f2e22af0f7a2e7dc3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
