However, matchmaking problems halted the first heat after two matches. Epic Games rescheduled the rest of Heat 1 for Saturday afternoon. The same issue delayed the Brazil, North America East and North America West regions by one hour on Friday.\n\nAdditionally, the North America East region played five games before more issues caused the sixth and final game to be rescheduled for Saturday evening. Players were notably frustrated with the delays.\n\nThe FNCS consists of two rounds of action, with each region competing separately. First, players are split into four heats. Then, the top eight players from each heat move to the Grand Finals. On Sunday, 32 teams in each region will compete in the Grand Finals for the regional championships.\n\nNorth America East\n\nIn the NA East region, Kyle \u201cSEN Bugha\u201d Giersdorf, Shawn \u201cRS clarityG\u201d Washington, and \u201cSTRETCH\u201d lead the first Heat. They won game three in a brilliant performance. A key piece of the victory was their ability to find the best level to tarp through. Every game, SEN Bugha, RS clarityG and STRETCH positioned themselves perfectly. The trio hold a 30-point lead with one game remaining.\n\nAnother trio that performed well is Noam \u201cFaZe Megga.\u201d Ackenine, Daniel \u201cFaZe Dubs.\u201d Walsh and Jared \u201cRogue Eclipsae\u201d Elwood. Rogue Eclipsae managed to eliminate SEN Bugha in the second game to earn a victory royale. The elimination could not come soon enough, as Rogue Eclipsae was about to die to storm damage. FaZe Megga., FaZe Dubs. and Rogue Eclipsae currently sit in third place in Heat 1.\n\nThe top eight for NA East Heat 1 with one game remaining:\n\n1. SEN Bugha, RS clarityG, STRETCH \u2014 84 points\n\n2. Htag, potgxd, Mercyfps. \u2014 54 points\n\n3. FaZe Megga., Rogue Eclipsae, FaZe Dubs. \u2014 52 points\n\n4.

TSM_Zexrow, yung calculator, MackWood1x \u2014 39 points\n\n8. Twitch ExactlyFN, yungGL0RY, chay5e \u2014 38 points\n\nNorth America West\n\nThe top trio in the NA West region continued its dominance. Evan \u201cLiquid Cented\u201d Barron, Benjamin \u201cNRG Edgey\u201d Peterson and Brodie \u201crehx\u201d Franks took over at the end of Heat 1. In the last three games, their team finished in third, first and second, respectively. They racked up 26 eliminations in those games and finished in first place for the heat.\n\nIn second, \u201cKNG Barl,\u201d \u201cWheels,\u201d and \u201cRichHomieQuinn\u201d displayed an incredibly consistent performance. Their worst placement during the six games was eighth. They finished with 79 points, just seven points behind Liquid Cented, NRG Edgey and rehx.\n\nThe eight NA West teams that earned spots in the Grand Finals:\n\n1. Liquid Cented, NRG Edgey, rehx \u2014 86 points\n\n2. KNG Barl, RichHomieQuinn, Wheels \u2014 79 points\n\n3. 1400 Joel, 1400 Pika, 1400 Rhux UwU \u2014 55 points\n\n4. captainy, Lollicker, niibs- \u2014 49 points\n\n5.

EG JTruth, Rise Joysick, scrupools \u2014 36 points\n\nEurope\n\nHeat 1 of the European region began with a win from Theo \u201cFnatic Pr0vokd\u201d Guillemenot, Howard \u201cCOOLER Noward\u201d Castiaux and Tom \u201cFaZe Vorwenn\u201d Baldrich. They kept the high ground as the zone rotated around a mountain and stopped all attempts to reach the safe zone. Their performance in game was clinical.\n\nThen, Kyle \u201cFaZe Mongraal.\u201d Jackson, Dmitri \u201cmitr0\u201d Van de Vrie, and Benjy \u201cNRG benjyfishy\u201d David Fish took over in game two. The trio eliminated 12 players on the way to a victory royale.
