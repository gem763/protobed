So much has changed that it\u2019s not really the tobacco industry anymore but rather the nicotine industry. But the fact remains that, whether you\u2019re smoking it, chewing it, or vaping it, nicotine is an addictive drug.\n\nE-cigarettes are also different in the sense that we don\u2019t have stacks of research about the risks associated with them. The industry is still young (e-cigarettes are less than 10 years old) but it\u2019s growing extremely fast. Top e-cigarette brand Juul is valued at $16 billion \u2013 and it\u2019s only four years old!\n\nBecause e-cigarettes are relatively new, the research on them is preliminary. I\u2019d like to share up-to-the-minute information with you about what we do and don\u2019t know about e-cigarettes.\n\nE-Cigarettes 101\n\nBut first, let\u2019s start with the basics. The \u201cE\u201d in e-cigarettes means electronic. And \u201ccigarette\u201d doesn\u2019t refer to the rolled-up leaf tobacco you are familiar with, but rather a battery-powered device that holds a cartridge of liquid nicotine, flavorings, and other chemicals. There is no fire involved, so as a result there is no tar or smoke. Thus, when you inhale and exhale you see, smell and taste vapor (usually flavored) \u2013 hence the term \u201cvaping.\u201d This liquid vapor might be mostly made up of water, but it\u2019s difficult for consumers and research to get an ingredient list for these products. Most companies treat their e-liquid as a business secret.\n\nUnlike tar and smoke, vapor doesn\u2019t blacken your lungs, stain your teeth or contain all of the particulates that cause lung cancer, heart disease, and the myriad of illnesses associated with smoking. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if research eventually discovers health risks associated with the chemicals tied to vaping, but as of now, there is no research to prove it.\n\nIt does contain plenty of nicotine; nicotine\u2019s health dangers include cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal disorders. Additionally, it\u2019s a carcinogen, and it\u2019s highly addictive.\n\nProponents of e-cigarettes say that they are a godsend to smokers who wish to quit tobacco and, eventually, nicotine. They also say that vaping is a safer alternative than tobacco \u2013 both for people who vape and those who are \u201csecondhand vapers\u201d. Critics argue that it\u2019s too premature to proclaim any new drug product is safe, especially without a thorough vetting from the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nLet\u2019s cut through the smoke (or vapor) and get at the heart of the debate about E-cigarettes.\n\nDangers of E-Cigarettes and Vaping\n\nIn simple terms, E-cigarettes give you nicotine without the smoke. Instead of smoke, you\u2019ll taste pumpkin pie, buttered popcorn, chocolate, cappuccino, cherry, blueberry, and a growing list of exotic flavors. Vaping or exposure to vaping doesn\u2019t result in a lasting unpleasant smoke smell or taste. Both of these reasons are why E-cigarettes are becoming very popular \u2013 especially for teens.\n\nWhich leads me back to nicotine \u2013 and also the added chemicals that create those flavors.\n\nThe popularity of vaping with teens makes me worry that e-cigarettes are creating a new generation of nicotine addicts. Unlike tobacco cigarettes, e-cigarettes give users the option to adjust the levels of nicotine that they inhale. Proponents say that this helps them ween off of nicotine over time by gradually dialing down the nicotine they inhale.\n\nCritics say that the exotic flavors encourage more e-cigarette use in general. It creates a sense that you\u2019ll want to try one new flavor after another. And that\u2019s much easier to do when vaping doesn\u2019t immediately punish your lungs and throat the way smoking does.\n\nTo me, one of the biggest unknowns of e-cigarettes surround these exotic flavors and the added chemicals. As of now, researchers can\u2019t possibly keep up with the growing list of flavors and the chemicals that make them. So far though, a couple of popular flavors contain an ominous ingredient, diacetyl, already known to health experts.\n\nBefore vapes, it was a chemical used to flavor popcorn, caramel and dairy products. When inhaled, it\u2019s been linked to deaths and cases of bronchiolitis obliterans, an irreversible lung disease. Nicknamed \u201cpopcorn lung,\u201d the disease\u2019s hallmark is the scarring of the tiny air sacs in the lungs, narrowing the airways, and resulting in wheezing and shortness of breath.[i]\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nDiacetyl has been removed from many food products, but it\u2019s still a common additive in e-cigarette liquids. Be on the lookout for it.\n\nCan E-Cigarettes Help You Quit Smoking?\n\nA recent study of popular smoking cessation techniques showed that vaping was demonstratively a better vehicle to quit smoking than nicotine gum, chews, inhalers, lozenges and patches.[ii] Researchers surmised a couple theories \u2013 the fact that nicotine levels can be adjusted in e-cigarettes and because vaping was more enjoyable than other cessation methods.\n\nThis was just one study, though. Previous studies did not conclude that e-cigarettes were a reliable cessation method. [iii]Other studies showed that teens who vaped had a higher risk of smoking cigarettes.[iv]\n\nAlso, now that marijuana laws have loosened and it\u2019s more widely available in different forms (such as liquid cartridges), people are using e-cigarettes to vape marijuana. Legally in states where marijuana use is legal. Illegally in states where it\u2019s not. And one study showed that teens who vape nicotine are more likely to use marijuana. [v]\n\nE-cigarettes are in their infancy, and more research is necessary to understand its role in smoking cessation and links to present and future drug use.\n\nThe Wild West of Nicotine Consumption\n\nWhat\u2019s known about e-cigarettes is vastly outnumbered by what\u2019s unknown. Many serious questions hang like a cloud over e-cigarettes, including:\n\nWhat are the confirmed risks of using e-cigarettes?\n\nIs vaping truly safer than smoking?\n\nIs it to proven and safe to be an effective way to quit smoking and nicotine addiction?\n\nWhat are in the chemicals added to flavor the nicotine?\n\nAre there any short-term and long-term risks from consumption of those chemicals?\n\nAre there short-term and long-term health risks from vaping?\n\nAre there short-term and long-term health risk from being exposed to secondhand vaping?\n\nAnd that\u2019s just a start. E-cigarettes are the wild west of nicotine consumption. It will take years, maybe decades, for the science to settle on even some of the most basic questions. And I would expect that the nicotine industry pushes back against negative findings, causing confusion among users about the risks of vaping.\n\nFor now, strongly discourage anyone in your life who is considering beginning to vape. It\u2019s expensive, nicotine has known negative health effects, and the e-liquid and method of delivery have known health effects. If you use e-cigarettes or are considering using them to stop smoking, start working today on your plan to cut down on use. A year from now, you should not be using e-cigarettes at all. In the meantime, stay informed as new research sheds more light on how vaping affects your health.\n\nReferences\n\n[i] \u201cPopcorn Lung: A Dangerous Risk of E-Cigarettes.\u201d American Lung Association.
