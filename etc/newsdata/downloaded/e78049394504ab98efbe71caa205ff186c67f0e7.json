She pushed for more African Americans to vote Republican, arguing Democratic policies have hindered, rather than helped, the black community.\n\nShe was invited to testify at the hearing about confronting white supremacy by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who ceded his time to her after Democrats mostly skipped over her during the discussion. Jordan is a prominent member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\nOwens went onto say that white nationalism is \u201cjust election rhetoric,\u201d echoing her earlier testimony on Capitol Hill in April and told lawmakers they should instead focus on \u201cGod and religion and shrinking government.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's 'Days of Our Lives' in here, and it's embarrassing,\u201d she said concluding her testimony.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress in July that the bureau had recorded approaching 100 arrests of domestic terrorism suspects in the previous nine months and most of those investigations of that kind involve some form of white supremacy.\n\nThere were 1,020 known hate groups in the country in 2018, the fourth straight year of growth, the New York Times reported earlier this year, citing the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors extremism in the U.S. Hate crimes, meanwhile, rose 30 percent in the three-year period ending in 2017, the Times also reported, citing FBI figures.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Candace Owens contradicted by DHS on threat of white nationalism", "description": "Conservative commentator Candace Owens said white nationalism is \u201cjust election rhetoric\u201d on the same day DHS added violent white supremacist extremist to its list of priority threats.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xjg0CCjmjoYu6xbb4Bq5mw--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/c10662e1bf5ebfb6fba291e5bdf18c3c", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
