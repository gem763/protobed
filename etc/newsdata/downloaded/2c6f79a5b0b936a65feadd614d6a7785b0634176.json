Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence, insisted he had done nothing wrong by not immediately giving the whistleblower\u2019s report to congress, or by showing the complaint to the White House.\n\nBut he refused to say whether he had discussed the matter with Mr Trump, saying he could not disclose details of his conversations with the president.\n\nMr Trump later told reporters that he wanted to find a way to stop the impeachment process \u201cmaybe legally, through the courts\u201d.\n\nHe also reportedly made a series of ominous comments about the White House staff who provided information to the whistleblower, at a private meeting.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, he said that anyone who provided information was \u201cclose to a spy\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nHe reportedly then referred to the media as \u201cscum\u201d.\n\nThe New York Times also reported that the whistleblower is a male CIA officer who was detailed to the White House. The paper said the nature of his complaint suggested that he is familiar with US foreign policy towards Europe with a sophisticated understanding of Ukraine and some legal knowledge \u2013 all of which could reassure politicians about the integrity of his report.\n\nThe complaint itself \u2013 which the White House had previously tried to avoid giving to congress \u2013 alleges that intelligence staff were alarmed at the nature of Mr Trump\u2019s call to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and that aides tried to conceal records of it.\n\nWhite House officials \u201cwere deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call\u201d, the complaint reads. \u201cThey told me that there was already a \u2018discussion ongoing\u2019 with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials\u2019 retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain.\u201d\n\nThey were allegedly \u201cdirected\u201d by lawyers to remove the transcript from the computer system where it would normally be stored.\n\nThe complaint says: \u201cInstead, the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature. One White House official described this act as an abuse of the electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\u201d\n\nIt is also alleged that Mr Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, \u201cis a central figure in this effort\u201d, and that the attorney-general, William Barr, \u201cappears to be involved as well\u201d.\n\nMs Pelosi, whose decision to impeach represents a huge gamble for Democrats ahead of next year\u2019s election, condemned what she called a \u201ccover-up\u201d.\n\nShe said Mr Trump had \u201cbetrayed his oath of office, our national security and the integrity\u201d of US elections.\n\nThe president himself unleashed a volley of tweets condemning the report and insisting that the whistleblower only had \u201csecond-hand information\u201d, even though their description of the Ukraine telephone call tallies with that put out by the White House this week.\n\nMr Giuliani, whose involvement in Ukrainian matters is coming under increasing scrutiny, told The Atlantic that he was doing nothing inappropriate and should be praised, adding: \u201cWhen this is over, I will be the hero.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a former prosecutor general in Ukraine undermined Mr Trump\u2019s repeated claims that Hunter Biden, son of Joe Biden, was involved in corrupt business practices in the former Soviet republic. Yuri Lutsenko told the Washington Post that he had not broken any Ukrainian laws.\n\nMr Trump has also accused Hunter Biden of corruptly taking $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) out of China. Mr Biden\u2019s lawyer has said that his client has not actually received anything from his investment in China. The president has not provided any evidence to back his claims.", "description": "Donald Trump has lashed out at\u00a0staff who said the White House \u201clocked down\u201d details\u00a0of his phone call with the Ukrainian president \u2013 likening them to spies\u00a0and alluding to possible punishment.
