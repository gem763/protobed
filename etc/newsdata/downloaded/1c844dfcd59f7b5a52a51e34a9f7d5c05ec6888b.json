The share have risen 19% since.\n\nAs a result, Roku is up 280% for the year and has an average price target of $131, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com.", "description": "StockBeat: Roku Jumps as Macquarie Says Users Could Triple", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE49167_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
