REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nWhat started as a protest against a now-suspended bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial, has evolved into a broad, increasingly violent, and creative, struggle for greater democracy.\n\nOver the past week, residents were seen out on their balconies or opening their windows to shout \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times\u201d, \u201cGa Yao!\u201d - a Cantonese expression of encouragement often translated as \u201cAdd oil\u201d - or simply vent expletives towards police and the government.\n\nThe shouting, heard across the territory, is often interactive - one person starts and a chorus of others soon respond.\n\n\u201cSome people may think it\u2019s naive,\u201d said Torres Fong, 22, a Hong Kong Baptist University student who joins the shouting from his dorm room every night.\n\n\u201cI think its value is far higher. It shows how Hong Kongers are united in this movement and how the spirit is spread across every district.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all live in a tense political atmosphere. Shouting is a way to let out steam and keeps us focused on our core demands.\u201d\n\nThe protesters\u2019 cries draw on a long tradition, albeit in uniquely Hong Kong style owing to its densely populated residential districts packed with dozens of tall blocks of tiny apartments.\n\nDuring the 1979 Iranian Revolution, residents of Tehran defied curfews to shout \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d (God is Greatest) from their rooftops - a gesture echoed in the city during 2009 protests against the re-election of Iran\u2019s then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n\nThrough the summer of 2013, and during protests since, Istanbul residents also raised a clamour by leaning from windows and banging pots and pans in support of demonstrations against Turkish leader Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nLess revolutionary, though sometimes political, the \u201cFlogsta scream\u201d, named after a neighbourhood in Uppsala, Sweden, is a long-known way for students there to vent out the window to deal with the stresses of university life.\n\nIt also occurs daily at 10 p.m.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the idea spread through social media app Telegram and LIHKG, a Reddit-like forum. Various posts invited Hong Kong people to join a late night concert, with free admission and a pyjamas dress code.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very touching,\u201d said Alice Lo, a 24-year-old web designer who lives with her mother in the Hang Hau neighbourhood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived here for two years and never had time to meet my neighbours. I\u2019m glad to know they are proud Hong Kongers who want freedom and democracy. It shows we\u2019re united.\u201d", "description": "Every night at 10 p.m., Hong Kong neighbourhoods and university dorms echo with pro-democracy and anti-government chants, the latest form of protest in the Chinese-ruled city where a civil disobedience movement has been going on for more than 12 weeks.", "authors": ["Felix Tam", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425393718&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8110L"}
