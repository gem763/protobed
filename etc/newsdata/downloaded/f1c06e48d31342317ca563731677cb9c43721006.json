(Photo: AP)\n\nA group of indigenous people in Bolivia are famous for their healthy hearts, but a new study shows that they are experiencing higher rates of obesity after the introduction of processed cooking oils to their diet.\n\nPeople who live in the few remaining societies that mostly gather and farm their food are well known for being physically fit. But new research suggests that the more these people have started to interact with the outside world, the more their diets have changed, with potentially negative impacts on their health.\n\nThe Tsiman\u00e9 are an indigenous group based in the South American country of Bolivia. Like several other communities in the world, the Tsiman\u00e9 sustain themselves primarily through the farming of small crops as well as foraging and hunting. This vanishingly rare method of survival has made them a keen area of interest for scientists, from anthropologists to biologists.\n\nAmong the fascinating discoveries made about the Tsiman\u00e9 and similar groups involves their hearts. While they are more likely to die young, often due to infectious disease, they famously almost never develop heart disease.\n\nAnd compared to every other group of people living in the industrialised world, their cardiovascular system is pristine. What makes this comparison all the more astonishing that their average level of physical activity is not that much higher than that of the average person, and they actually eat more daily calories.\n\nLike so many foraging societies in the past, however, the Tsiman\u00e9 are increasingly coming into contact with the rest of the world. Some of this exposure is forced, as mining and lumber companies have illegally violated their land rights, devastated their environment, and pressured them to move closer to cities and urban settlements. But their overall population is also growing, putting a strain on their resources. As a result, the Tsiman\u00e9 are starting to take jobs to earn wages and send their children to school.\n\nIn a paper published this June in Obesity, researchers studying the Tsiman\u00e9 say this shift is already starting to change their bodies. They looked at eight years of data on Tsiman\u00e9 adults over the age of 20, dating back to 2002, when the Tsimane Health and Life History Project first began. This data not only included measurements of their heart health and body mass index, but diaries of their eating habits; all told, more than 300 Tsiman\u00e9 were included in the study.\n\nIn 2002, they found, 22.6 per cent of Tsiman\u00e9 women were considered overweight (a BMI between 25 to 30), while 2.4 per cent were obese (a BMI over 30. But by 2010, 28.8 per cent were overweight and 8.9 per cent were obese. Tsiman\u00e9 men, who are typically more active than the women, experienced similar but smaller increases in BMI.\n\nThese rates are still far below those seen in other groups of people. In the U.S., for instance, over two-thirds of adults are overweight, and nearly half are obese. And as recently as 2015, according to a 2017 study, the Tsiman\u00e9 still have very low rates of cardiovascular disease.\n\nBut some of the current findings suggest their heart health is likely changing for the worse, and it\u2019s not a great sign for people living elsewhere in the world. Even though their average calorie intake didn\u2019t change much, the increased use of cooking oil was linked to higher BMI among Tsiman\u00e9 women.\n\nBy 2010, nearly a third of households reported using cooking oil bought from stores, and it was the only food clearly linked to increased BMI, even as other foods like sugar or refined grains were also more commonly eaten.\n\n\u201cWe found that even small increases in market-based foods that are high in calories even in small servings, contributed to fat gain in this active, subsistence-based population,\u201d study author Alan Schultz, an anthropologist at Baylor University, said in a statement released by the university. \u201cCooking oil adds so much flavour \u2014 we use it for a reason \u2014 but at 120 calories and 14 fat grams per tablespoon, few foods can so easily alter your diet.\u201d\n\nDiet alone isn\u2019t the only thing poised to dramatically change for the Tsiman\u00e9 in the years to come. And certainly some aspects of modernisation, such as more available health care for children, will benefit them.\n\nBut given the increasingly grim research suggesting how diets rich in processed foods harm our bodies, the renowned heart health of the Tsiman\u00e9 might be at risk.", "description": "A group of indigenous people in Bolivia are famous for their healthy hearts, but a new study shows that they are experiencing higher rates of obesity after the introduction of processed cooking oils to their diet....", "authors": ["Germain Lussier", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/m2d33fples0qpnki8smq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
