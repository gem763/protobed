Bernie Sanders\n\nThis fan-created video in support of Bernie Sanders includes an important rebuke to that once much-more-popular satirical offering of Comedy Central, The Daily Show.\n\nIn May, The Daily Show went through the archives of Sanders\u2019 1980s public access TV show, Bernie Speaks With the Community, made while he was the mayor of Burlington, Vt. After showcasing Sanders asking a group of grade schoolers if they had ever seen cocaine, host Trevor Noah declared, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Bernie can\u2019t tell the difference between kids and adults.\u201d The show then cut to Sanders telling some child, \u201cAlright, I think you\u2019re dumb.\u201d The audience gasps and groans, and Noah cracks up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the fan video follows that Daily Show snippet with the complete context of Sanders\u2019 exchange with the kids. Sanders\u2019 sentence doesn\u2019t end with \u201cdumb.\u201d The mayor told the kids, \u201cI think you\u2019re dumb if you don\u2019t sit down and learn how to read and write. No, you were not born stupid. Come here. The only way I think you\u2019re dumb? I think when you think you\u2019re dumb. Because you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nWhatever else you think of Sanders, that out-of-context clip is unrepresentative of his remarks. He\u2019s trying to convince the kids that they have great potential and encouraging them to study and working hard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a long while, folks who weren\u2019t such a fan of The Daily Show and the previous host Jon Stewart \u2014 usually conservatives \u2013 noted the \u201cclown nose on, clown nose off\u201d defense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVarious cultural high mucky-mucks would declare Stewart and his various wannabes were some of the most important and consequential voices in our political discourse, but their defenders also insisted they didn\u2019t have to be fair or accurate when they talked about issues because they were comedians, not journalists. One moment you\u2019re being told that the court jesters were the real truth-tellers in our society; the next you\u2019re being told that their inaccuracies or exaggerations didn\u2019t matter, because hey, they\u2019re just comedians telling jokes, man, lighten up.\n\nBack in 2015, I wrote, \u201cHeavily editing interviews and misleading interview guests are pretty minor sins for a comedy show; if everyone knows the aim of the show is to make viewers laugh, and not inform them, it\u2019s pointless to argue about the need for fairness, objectivity, or even-handedness. But if the show is real journalism, as its most passionate advocates insist, then it\u2019s a sneeringly dishonest practitioner.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe you can\u2019t stand Bernie Sanders, maybe you love him. But maybe now some folks on the other side of the aisle will grasp that a dishonest, out-of-context video snippet on a television program is bad, even when it\u2019s in the service of comedy. If you want to oppose or dislike Sanders, do it for things he actually said and did \u2013 not because Trevor Noah leaves you believing that he calls little kids dumb.", "description": "Whatever you think of him, taking Bernie Sanders' comments to kids out of context is unfair.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "David French", "Matthew Continetti", "Brian Stewart", "John Fund", "George Will", "Jack Crowe", "Kyle Smith", "Jonah Goldberg", "Rich Lowry"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bernie-sanders-gun-sense.jpg?fit=1200%2C700&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
