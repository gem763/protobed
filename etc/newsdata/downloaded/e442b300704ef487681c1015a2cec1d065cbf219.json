Here\u2019s how it would work\n\nThe science of extending life is a subject of morbid fascination, conjuring the image of old billionaires being cryogenically frozen. But imagine if, instead of a pill you could take to live for ever, there was a pill that could push back the ageing process \u2013 a medicine that could stave off the fragility, osteoarthritis, memory loss, macular degeneration and cancers that plague old age.\n\nIt could happen, with the science of senolytics: an emerging \u2013 and highly anticipated \u2013 area of anti-ageing medicine. Many of the world\u2019s top gerontologists have already demonstrated the possibilities in animals and are now beginning human clinical trials, with promising results. If the studies continue to be as successful as hoped, those who are currently middle-aged could become the first generation of oldies who are youthful for longer \u2013 with a little medical help.\n\nMost scientists studying longevity are more concerned with prolonging what they call \u201chealthspan\u201d than they are lifespan: that is to say, helping people to age with less pain and illness, with a better quality of life. Not only would this be good for old people, but in these times of booming elderly populations worldwide, it would be great for economies.\n\nIn England and Wales, life expectancy has risen by almost 25 years in the past century; the Office for National Statistics predicts that the UK\u2019s population of over-65-year-olds will grow by 8.6 million (about the population of London) over the coming 50 years. This will be expensive: the NHS spends more than twice as much on 65-year-olds as it does on 30-year-olds; 85-year-olds cost more than five times as much.\n\nDr Ming Xu.

Ageing, as Xu notes, is the biggest risk factor for most chronic diseases; the goal of his lab is to unearth novel interventions to slow down the ageing process and simultaneously prevent the diseases.\n\nXu is at work on senolytics, a branch of medicine that targets senescent cells; the various faulty cells that have been identified as instrumental in our eventual demise. These so-called \u201czombie\u201d cells linger and proliferate as we age, emitting substances that cause inflammation and turn other healthy cells senescent, ultimately leading to tissue damage throughout the body.\n\nXu was part of a team at the Mayo Clinic, an academic medical centre in Minnesota, that showed in 2011 that \u201cusing a genetic trick to get rid of these senescent cells can significantly improve health and lifespan\u201d in prematurely aged mice. In 2016, the same group achieved similar results in naturally aged mice, releasing an arresting image of two elderly rodents born of the same litter. The one cleared of its senolytic cells seems spry and glossy, while its sibling is shrunken, greying and looks its age.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Litter-mates, almost two years old; the mouse on the right had its senescent cells cleared and appears younger than the mouse on the right.

Kevin Perrott, president of the Washington DC-based Global Healthspan Policy Institute, said in 2018 that the response showed that Silicon Valley tended to view ageing as a problem that could be solved \u201cwith enough time and enough steps\u201d: \u201cThe size of the return is huge. If you\u2019re able to bring anything like that to the market, you have something that\u2019s universally needed.\u201d\n\nHowever, the \u201cgenetic trick\u201d used to destroy senescent cells in the mouse studies was not viable as a safe treatment for people, so a new company, called Unity Biotech, was formed to raise funds to develop medicine that could safely clear zombie cells from the human body.\n\nThe first hurdle \u2013 for them, and the other scientists investigating the unknown intricacies of senolytics \u2013 was identifying what, exactly, they were trying to treat. In order for a drug to be approved, it has to be shown to be effective in treating a disease; but ageing is a natural built-in process, and, far from a localised problem, it involves complex systemic degradation.\n\nTrials in senolytics are initially targeting specific conditions such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (which includes emphysema). Most are in the fledgling stages, working on rodents or human tissue in petri dishes, although in February a small early human trial showed an improvement in the distance patients were able to walk.\n\nAlso this year, a pre-clinical pilot trial for injecting a senolytic drug into the knees of people with osteoarthritis showed promising, if mixed results. In the first part of the study, where patients received varying doses of the drug, significant improvements in pain and function were observed, whereas the second experiment, in which patients received the maximum dose, didn\u2019t see significant benefits. It is hoped that, eventually, there will be a number of senolytic drugs that could potentially target different senescent cell types, but currently much of the research has involved a combination of a leukaemia drug called dasatinib and quercetin, a polyphenol common in plants.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dr Sebastian Gr\u00f6nke. Photograph: Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing\n\nThis is an extremely new field of research. \u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s so much interest,\u201d says Sebastian Gr\u00f6nke at the Max-Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing in Cologne. Senolytics are particularly exciting, he says, because \u201cthey seem to still work very late in life\u201d ... \u201cSo it will be possible to study more quickly whether they actually work in humans, and they are applicable to people already at the end of their lives.\u201d\n\nXu says that, in theory at least, it should prove impossible to build up a resistance to the drugs, \u201cbecause senescent cells cannot proliferate\u201d. Even more importantly, he says, there is significant data to show \u201cthat you don\u2019t have to treat these patients every single day. You just treat them once a week or once a month \u2026 intermittent treatment is more than enough to have huge benefits.\u201d\n\nSenolytic drugs may also be able to play a part in other conditions. Xu has found that obesity can cause senescent cells to develop prematurely. \u201cWe also found that clearing senescent cells improves insulin sensitivity. So senolytic drugs not only work on ageing but also on obesity \u2026 Senescence is a connection between these two very common conditions.\u201d While treating obese mice with senolytics, Xu observed that their anxiety levels reduced, too.\n\nThese aren\u2019t the only potential added benefits. Gr\u00f6nke says that senescent cells \u201cplay a big role after cancer treatment\u201d, developing as a result of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. \u201cIf senolytics can be used to help eliminate the damaged cells before they can spread, a detrimental side-effect of cancer treatment could be alleviated.\u201d\n\nXu usually administers senolytics to mice at their equivalent of 70 to 80 years old in humans. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to take it when you\u2019re young, which would have zero effect, or harmful effects \u2013 but you don\u2019t want to leave it too late. When to start giving the drug is a huge project and a huge question for us to answer over the next several decades.\u201d He expects the ideal treatment age will differ from person to person, and that ultimately scientists will develop a blood or urine test that can assess the level of senescence present. \u201cSome people age very fast, and some age very slow, so it could vary a lot,\u201d he says.\n\nSo what can anyone determined to hold off the debilitating effects of age do while we await the wonder drugs? Intermittent fasting may have senescent effects. Gr\u00f6nke says caloric restriction, whereby \u201cpeople eat less in general\u201d, has been linked to healthy ageing and longevity. Mouse trials have shown that they can live 30 to 50% longer than control animals able to eat as much as they want. \u201cIt\u2019s also well known that these animals have less senescent cells at comparable ages.\u201d There is also a diet, developed by the gerontologist Valter Longo at the University of Southern California, that mimics the effects of fasting for those too frail to skip meals.\n\nOf course, the risks of disease that increase with ageing are heightened by sedentary living, alcoholism and bad diet. Gr\u00f6nke recommends, along with a healthy diet, \u201creducing the amount of animal protein you consume \u2013 you can eat meat but ideally maybe once per week, maximum.\u201d He says an association between low protein intake and longevity is well established in humans. \u201cIdeally the protein should come from vegetables and not from meat.\u201d\n\nJust as obesity has been shown to increase the burden of senescent cells in tissue, exercise can reduce it, says Xu. But the effects were recorded in obese mice that had undergone a lot of vigorous exercise: \u201cI don\u2019t think the aged population is able to take intense exercise like that.\u201d\n\nSo some signs are promising, and the potential is huge, but much still remains unknown about senolytics for ageing. There are clinical trials in the pipeline, with drugs for osteoarthritis leading the way, but an effective pill accessible to all is certainly not imminent. Xu puts it at five to 12 years away: \u201cTheoretically I\u2019m confident.\u201d Those looking to live for ever might be wise to book that cryogenics appointment, just in case.", "description": "A simple treatment to stave off the health problems of old age could be available in five to 12 years.
