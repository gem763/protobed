He is too good not to integrate but it may take time\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d Antoine Griezmann replied but he was not daft enough to actually answer it. With that line, he had said enough. On the eve of last week\u2019s Champions League match against Internazionale, Griezmann was asked if he would play better on the right. The question was leading and what came next was even more telling than his response.\n\nA new Sevilla but the same old story as Barcelona blow them away | Sid Lowe Read more\n\nThe following night he was withdrawn after an hour. Four days later, he spent the Sevilla match on the bench. Barcelona had paid \u20ac120m for him but the first time all their senior forwards were available he was left out in favour of a front three made up of Lionel Messi, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9.\n\nAfter the win over Villarreal last month, in which he scored the opener, Griezmann noted a little pointedly: \u201cThree goals isn\u2019t bad, is it?\u201d It is not \u2013 at the time he was the club\u2019s top scorer and a fortnight on only Su\u00e1rez has more \u2013 and no one is suggesting he is bad either. But there is a predictable problem, a difficulty finding his place.\n\nOn his home debut, against Real Betis in August, Griezmann scored twice, celebrating by throwing blue and red confetti into the air. He had copied that from the basketball player LeBron James; he had copied the goal too, saying: \u201cI see Messi doing it in training.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lionel Messi was forced to deny this week that he had not wanted Griezmann to sign for Barcelona.

He had known his arrival was not universally popular after the way he had turned Barcelona down a summer before he actually signed, the decision played out in a TV documentary. \u201cIf I have to say sorry, I\u2019ll do it on the pitch,\u201d he had said but that has not been easy. Last week he admitted he and Messi are quiet, so \u201cit\u2019s not easy for us to talk\u201d. And on Thursday Messi had to deny suggestions he had not wanted Griezmann to come at all.\n\nBut beyond all those other considerations, this comes down to something simple that is not so simple after all: football, where to fit the Frenchman in. At the same time as he said it was a \u201clie\u201d to suggest he had not wanted Griezmann, Messi admitted that, yes, he had wanted Barcelona to sign Neymar and thus revive that famous \u201ctrident\u201d. In it, Neymar\u2019s role is to play where the Frenchman is currently playing \u2013 or, more accurately, where he is having to play. As for the other two members of that front three, they play where Griezmann would best play.\n\nAt Real Sociedad, Griezmann played on the left of a front three, but that was five years ago. His emergence as one of the world\u2019s best players at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid came with him in one of two positions, or sometimes both at the same time: off the right or off the front, through the middle. In other words, Messi\u2019s or Su\u00e1rez\u2019s position. It is one thing to copy Messi when he is not there; another to do it when he is. When the rest returned he was pushed to the left wing, the place he had left behind, away from his natural spheres of influence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just arrived, it\u2019s a different position, I have to change my movements, improve,\u201d Griezmann admitted. \u201cI need to get into the game more, improve my play on the wing. My teammates want the best from me and so do I.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Griezmann celebrates with confetti after scoring on his home debut against Real Betis.

It is early and he probably can relearn a left-sided role. He is too good to give up on, not to integrate, not to seek a solution, but it may take time and imagination. Maybe an entire new formation, which risks making matters worse. It may take difficult decisions too. If he does not get left out, who does? It is not going to be Messi, so Su\u00e1rez?\n\nThere are also alternatives to him and if there is one thing worse than playing out of position it is not playing at all. In his absence, it worked. When he was replaced by Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, it was far from perfect but the fit was that little bit more natural. The good news for Griezmann is that Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 was sent off at the end of the Sevilla game for calling the referee \u201cvery bad\u201d, and he will be suspended for two games \u2013 including the cl\u00e1sico. There is no better match in which to make a point. But can he from out there on the wing? If Ansu Fati is fit, it is not unthinkable that he still does not start then, either.\n\n\u201cWhere do you think Griezmann plays best?\u201d Ernesto Valverde was asked before the Inter game. \u201cIn the forward line,\u201d he shot back swiftly, tongue slightly in his cheek, knowing where this was going. \u201cI think he looks good on the left; he can play there. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea for him to play on the left or in the middle,\u201d the Barcelona manager continued, before adding a little sarcastically, \u201cbut, yeah, I\u2019ll have a think about him on the right.\u201d\n\nThere is a question there and, as Griezmann said, it is a good one.", "description": "The Frenchman has initially had to play on the left and when Messi, Su\u00e1rez and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 were all available he was on the bench.
