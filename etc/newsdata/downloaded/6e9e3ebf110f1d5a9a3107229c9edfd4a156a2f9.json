Fibrous foods are often bulky and, therefore, filling. Soluble fibre (roughage) forms a gel that slows down the emptying of the stomach and the transit time of food through the digestive system. This extends the time a person feels satisfied or \"full\" . It also delays the absorption of sugars from the intestines. This helps to maintain lower blood sugar levels and prevent a rapid rise in blood insulin levels, which has been linked with obesity and an increased risk of diabetes.

Increase your fibre serves to five a day\n\nAccording to dietary recommendations, the average Australian requires 30 grams of fibre per day.\n\nSusie said a high-fibre intake helps to lower cholesterol problems and regulate insulin, particularly when it is consumed in the morning.\n\nTo meet daily requirements, the dietitian suggested eating two slices of dark, seedy bread, two servings of fruit as well as five servings of vegetables (a serving is considered half a cup).\n\n'Include some fresh fruit and vegetables as part of every meal - at breakfast, lunch and dinner to get that bulk,' Susie said.\n\nShe said by eating the recommended amount of fibre daily you'll be naturally fuller this was an easy way to regulate appetite and hormones.\n\nA fibre serve is generally regarded as half a cup and this is something that can be easily consumed in a salad at lunch\n\n2. Caffeine helps kick-start the metabolism\n\nCaffeine in any form helps stimulate your metabolism and is particularly effective when you drink in the morning.\n\nSusie explained the stimulating properties of caffeine helped to 'mobilise fat stores' as well as to repress the appetite.\n\nShe said if you are watching your weight, you will need to check how milky your coffee is as this is where hidden sugars can be found.\n\n3. Eating sugar makes you crave more sugar\n\nIf you prefer breakfast on-the-go, there's a chance you may be drawn to muffins, banana bread or smoothies.\n\nSusie said the problem these types of foods, particularly in the morning, is they increase insulin and will drive up your appetite.\n\nThis means despite having eaten, you'll still feel ravenous and may find yourself constantly snacking as a way to satisfy 'hunger'.\n\nIt's all too easy to reach for a slice of banana bread if you've not had breakfast, however, doing so can set you up for poor choices throughout the day\n\n4. Make sure you drink plenty of fluid throughout day\n\nIn addition to drinking two litres of water a day, something that helps you naturally feel fuller, Susie also recommends drinking green tea.\n\nShe said research has shown green tea helps increase metabolic rate (how fast your body converts food to energy) and the beverage can also quash sugar cravings.\n\nThe nutritionist also said there's some evidence to show drinking water that's ice-cold is a way to get your metabolism firing.\n\n'If you sip on iced water all day, you could burn about 100 extra calories over the course of the day,' she said.\n\nWhile dietary recommendations advise 40g of vitamin C per day, boosting this to 100g a day can help you burn fat\n\n5. Drink juice while working out to burn fat\n\nSusie said while the recommended daily intake of vitamin C is 40g per day, 'bumping' this up to 100g can help shift stubborn kgs.\n\nThe nutritionist said there is evidence which shows your body will burn more fat when your vitamin C levels are increased.\n\nShe explained you can boost vitamin C levels by eating a range of foods like oranges, limes as well as capsicums.", "description": "Australian dietitian Susie Burrell has revealed her top tips for burning unwanted belly fat.
