Asana Automation, as the new feature is called, allows users to create their own \u201cif this then that\u201d rules, but also features a new voice transcription service, as well as an OCR tool and new smart templates that integrate some of the service\u2019s machine learning smarts.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year we launched Workload, empowering teams to be more agile when planning, monitoring and managing their efforts,\u201d said Asana head of product said Alex Hood. \u201cNow with Automation, we\u2019re introducing the ability to automate your routine tasks so you can spend more energy on your craft and leave the repetitive busywork to Asana.\u201d\n\nThe rule builder comes with over 70 pre-build and preset rules at launch, but users can obviously build their own rules as well. Asana customers can use the service to automatically route tasks to a specific team member, for example. Like with the rest of the new features the company announced today, the idea here is to automate many of the processes that keep teams busy all day, doing \u201cwork about work.\u201d\n\nThe new OCR and transcription services, which are now available in Asana\u2019s iPhone app, are pretty self-explanatory. They make it easier to capture what was said in a meeting or written on a whiteboard, which users can then assign to a given task in Asana.\n\nSmart project templates, too, take some of the grunt work out of using Asana. \u201cNow when using a template, such as an event plan or campaign launch, a complete workback schedule can be instantly layered on,\u201d the company explains. \u201cWhen a conflict arises between task deadlines, Asana will automatically correct, enabling teams to spend less time setting up projects and workflows, and more time getting work done.\u201d", "description": "Work management platform Asana today announced the launch of a new feature that will take the work out of some of the most mundane and repetitive tasks on its platform.
