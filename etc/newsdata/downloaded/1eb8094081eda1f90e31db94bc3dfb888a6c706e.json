It's tough to say which was my favourite. The header was cool but I think I'd have to go with the first one, the left foot, I don't know why.\n\n\"It's actually my first professional hat-trick so I nearly forgot the match ball. Luckily my team-mates helped me out.\"\n\nThrilled boss Frank Lampard admitted the exertions of the midweek Champions League trip to last season's semi-finalists had concerned him ahead of the encounter with a notoriously physical Burnley side in Lancashire.\n\nPulisic capped his hat-trick with a header as Chelsea went 4-0 up before later conceding twice\n\nThe former Borussia Dortmund man hit menacing top form as Chelsea cemented fourth place\n\nChelsea have won their last seven and beat Ajax 1-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday\n\n'It's really pleasing because it's a worry,' said Lampard, who included Pulisic ahead of Callum Hudson-Odoi in the only change from midweek. 'You travel back, you're aware the other team doesn't have that situation.\n\n'That was a really taxing game - it was our toughest physical game of the year, so credit to the medical staff and everyone that works around the players.\n\n'They put a lot of hours in and, in the last two or three days, the players themselves have been professional about how they have recovered and picked themselves up to come to Burnley.'\n\nThe only negatives for Chelsea were two late goals for Burnley as Jay Rodriguez hit a stunning strike in the 86th minute before Dwight McNeil found the net in stoppage time, suggesting their defensive worries are not yet over.\n\nStill got no words for yesterday. Thankful for my teammates and the fans!

'It's easy to take the small gloss off it with two goals late on, but it doesn't take any gloss off for me. For 95 per cent of the game we played some outstanding football at a really tough place to play - that's what made me very happy.'\n\nIt was a frustrating night for Burnley on the occasion of their 200th Premier League game as first-half errors from Matthew Lowton and James Tarkowski were punished by Pulisic while Ashley Barnes could not take a number of opportunities that came his way.\n\n'It was an odd night in that I don't think there was too much in the game, especially in the first half,' manager Sean Dyche said.\n\n'We've created some good chances, but we ended up 2-0 down when mistakes were punished.\n\n'It's poor from us for giving the ball away in those positions, and credit to them for taking those chances, but you come in 2-0 down and scratching your head.\n\n'Then we started the second half quite bright and took the game on again, but we gave away a third and then it's really tough.\n\n'At four it certainly didn't feel like a 0-4 game, because we created some really good chances and that's pleasing.'", "description": "Pulisic's first Chelsea goals arrived in a hurry as he rewarded Frank Lampard's decision to give him a first league start since August with a match-winning performance, putting them in control.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff", "Ben Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/11/20241664-0-image-a-7_1572175955773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
