Gen. Tony Aguto, commanding general of the 3rd Infantry Division, said in the release. \u201cWe are extremely saddened by the loss.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThree other soldiers were injured and were transported to Winn Army Community Hospital for treatment, according to the release.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur hearts and prayers go out to all the families affected by this tragedy,\u201d Aguto said.\n\nThe Army has yet to release the names of the soldiers involved. Next of kin are being notified, and the incident is under investigation, the release said.\n\nThe Fort Stewart incident comes as more than a dozen American service members have been killed in training exercises in the past year. The death toll has prompted calls from military families and congressional leaders for improved training standards and practices.\n\nAs The Washington Post reported in August, fatalities in training exercises outnumber combat deaths 4 to 1. According to the Pentagon, training fatalities are down overall, but at least 15 service members have been killed in the past year. Those fatalities also represent an increase from last year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong the most recent deaths was in April, when Joshua Braica, 29, a Marine special operator, was killed in an accident at Camp Pendleton in California. A month later, Marine 1st Lt. H. Conor McDowell died in a rollover at the same base. Also in May, Marine Lance Cpl. Hans Sandoval-Pereyra, 21, was killed in Australia. In June, a Humvee accident in Alaska resulted in the death of Army Spec. Marquise Elliott, 25. Staff Sgt. Andrew Michael St. John, 29, was killed in a Humvee rollover in August at Fort Hood in Texas.\n\nAs The Post has reported, the Government Accountability Office is expected to study the military fatalities.\n\nThe Pentagon has implemented technical solutions aimed at improving training safety in vehicles, including anti-lock brakes and systems designed to reduce the risk of rollovers.\n\n\u201cI keep thinking, is anyone taking seriously what happened to my son?\u201d Alexandrina Braica, mother of Joshua Braica, told The Post in August. \u201cDid anyone say, \u2018Okay, we had a fatality, let\u2019s ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The accident comes as more than a dozen American service members have been killed in training exercises in the past year.", "authors": ["Kyle Swenson", "National Enterprise Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YxcfeqRXzYg0hYbRShiZgWvV3ME=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4277VVXTOEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
