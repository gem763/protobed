Stephanie Murphy warned Wednesday.\n\nRep. Murphy, Florida Democrat, raised concerns during an interview with voters being left in the dark months since learning that at least two, unspecified Florida counties had their election systems compromised during the previous White House race by suspected Russian state-sponsored hackers.\n\nThe FBI has not revealed which counties were hacked, and Ms. Murphy said that a report issued recently by the Senate Intelligence Committee suggests as many as four in Florida were breached.\n\n\u201cThe drips and drabs of information that are coming out about this very serious attack on our democracy is not helpful in helping us prepare to respond to it.\u201d Ms. Murphy told MSNBC host Chris Hayes.\n\n\u201cThe way that you combat information warfare is to be able to have a whole-of-society approach, and that involves inoculating the public; giving them the tools so that they can discern what has happened and then protect themselves against future attacks,\u201d said the congresswoman.\n\nFloridians first learned that state election systems were breached in April, nearly three years after the race ended, when it was mentioned briefly in the report released by Robert Mueller, the former special counsel who led the Department of Justice investigation into Russian interference.\n\nOfficials previously unaware of Mr. Mueller\u2019s findings subsequently sought and received briefings from the FBI in which they were told at least two Florida counties had been hacked, according to attendees. More recently, the Senate panel\u2019s report released in July said that an unidentified state presumed by some to be Florida had systems in four counties hacked. None of the affected counties have been publicly disclosed, however, and officials briefed by the FBI said they agreed not to identify them.\n\nBoth the Justice Department and Senate committee\u2019s reports have found that Russians failed to alter any voting data by breaching election systems.\n\nAsked on MSNBC how Floridians can be certain their votes were cast correctly, Ms. Murphy proposed starting with some transparency.\n\n\u201cThe way that you could probably convince people that their information wasn\u2019t changed is to let the voters know which countries were affected and allow voters to go verify for themselves that their information wasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Ms. Murphy.\n\n\u201cWe are watching the lack of information, the shroud of secrecy, undermine the voters\u2019 confidence in our systems,\u201d said the congresswoman.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment on the congresswoman\u2019s complaints.\n\nMr. Mueller\u2019s report assessed that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 race in a \u201csweeping and systematic fashion,\u201d which included cyberattacks waged by state-sponsored hackers against U.S. targets including voting infrastructure. Moscow has denied responsibility.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
