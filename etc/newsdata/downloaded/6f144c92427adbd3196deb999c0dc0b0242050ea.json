The hinges that are used to unfold the table can buckle if they're not secured.\n\n'Parents are obviously busy and are likely to flip the table open and change their child without latching the hinges, which makes them weaker and prone to breaking.'\n\nStuva cot - $409\n\nChoice said if assembling flatpacks isn't your forte, the Stuva cot was best to avoid buying after they found the model was 'extremely hard to assemble'.\n\nGOOD BUYS\n\nMattresses\n\nIf you're in the market for a new mattress, Choice home expert Peter Zaluzny said the Ikea range was not a bad option.\n\nWhen comparing with other cheaper models, the experts found Ikea's free trial period is three times longer than Koala's and their warranty lasts up to 25 year.\n\nWith many models to choose from, you can easily find the perfect mattress just by testing them out in store before entering the free trial period.\n\nAntilop baby highchair - $24.99\n\nChoice found the Antilop highchair with tray was a 'bargain buy that does the job'\n\nChoice found the Antilop highchair with tray was a 'bargain buy that does the job'.\n\nEasy to dissemble, the product, which comes complete with a safety belt, is lightweight and easy to clean.\n\n'The Ikea high chair is simplicity and function rolled into one affordable piece of baby equipment,' a Choice member said.\n\n'Everyone I know who has purchased a cheap Ikea highchair as a \"back-up\" at granny's, or for a holiday house, have soon discarded their fussy, expensive chair in favour of this one.'\n\nChoice found the Matmassig gas cooktop (pictured) was one of the top performers\n\nChoice recommended the Billy bookcases (pictured one of the Billy bookcases - $79)\n\nMatmassig gas cooktop - $299\n\nChoice found the Matmassig gas cooktop was one of the top performers.\n\nThe product is easy to use and performed well at all temperatures.\n\nBilly bookcases\n\nChoice recommended the iconic Billy bookcases, with prices starting from $55.\n\nEarlier this year, IKEA revealed it's estimated that every five seconds, one BILLY bookcase is sold somewhere in the world.\n\nLaunched in 1979, the product has long become the book lovers' choice that never goes out of style.\n\nOthers\n\nOther items Choice recommended included wooden coat hangers, paper napkins, children's plates and cutlery, tea lights and it's delicious lingonberry jam, which is usually served with its famous meatballs.", "description": "From cots to mattresses, ovens and fridges, Australian consumer group CHOICE has revealed the  IKEA products to avoid - and the best items worth buying.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/02/19719144-0-image-a-102_1571102808035.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
