It is organized destruction,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSecularists and their allies among the \u2018progressives\u2019 have marshaled all the force of mass communications, popular culture, the entertainment industry and academia in an unremitting assault on religion and traditional values.\u201d\n\nAnyone who missed the speech should find it and watch it. Anyone with a child in school should print out the speech and send it to him or her \u2014 or any of the other 16 genders schools are offering for students these days.\n\nThe smorgasbord of gender options inspires snorts of laughter among serious people, vexes anyone who believes in actual science and causes others to scoff and walk away.\n\nBut the infidels and infantiles who are running higher education today must be confronted with more than just laughter and dismissal. They are, after all, the ones destroying America by poisoning the minds of children. That is why the attorney general\u2019s speech at Notre Dame is so important.\n\nIt is also why so many boars in the media took such offense to the speech and began squealing like a herd of mad swine racing for the lake.\n\nOne magazine cried that Mr. Barr is \u201cneck-deep in extremist Catholic institutions.\u201d\n\nFor defending religious liberty?\n\nOh my. They make precisely William Barr\u2019s point for him.\n\nA major newspaper opined: \u201cGod is now Trump\u2019s co-conspirator.\u201d It was not meant as a compliment, again proving Mr. Barr\u2019s point.\n\n\u201cIs this Barr\u2019s cry for help?\u201d pondered another major newspaper.\n\nAll the squealing proved not only Mr. Barr\u2019s point about the rabid intolerance of religious liberty but also that so many of the \u201cintellectuals\u201d in charge of American magazines and newspapers have already been poisoned by the nonsense and dishonesty dispensed by higher education these days.\n\nThese people are not only anti-religion, but they also are anti-science, anti-history, and anti-liberty. Alexander Hamilton would weep if he knew the power these people now hold in his beloved republic.\n\nMr. Hamilton also would have applauded Mr. Barr\u2019s speech. He and all the Founders would have recognized the speech as a flawless continuation of the endless debates they had about the nature of man, liberty and religion.\n\nPicking up on the Founders\u2019 discussion of man\u2019s capacity for both \u201cgreat good\u201d and \u201cgreat evil,\u201d Mr. Barr said the \u201ccoercive power of government\u201d cannot alone maintain a civil society. There must be other \u2014 more free and voluntary \u2014 guides of citizens\u2019 behavior.\n\nThe notion of self-governance, he said, has dual meaning.\n\n\u201cIt did not mean primarily the mechanics by which we select a representative legislative body. It referred to the capacity of each individual to restrain and govern themselves.\u201d\n\nParticularly alarming to Mr. Barr is the lust with which secular zealots go after personal, private religion.\n\n\u201cMilitant secularists today do not have a \u2018live and let live\u2019 spirit,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not content to leave religious people alone to practice their faith. Instead, they seem to take delight in compelling people to violate their conscience.\u201d\n\nIt is that very lust that leads political monsters to create untamable leviathans like Obamacare, which forces the Little Sisters of the Poor to violate their most precious religious convictions.\n\nIs it any surprise, then, to see citizens turn on one another with the same evil lust?\n\n\u2981 Contact Charles Hurt at churt@washingtontimes.com or on Twitter @charleshurt.", "description": "As the Caribbean saying goes, \u201cI chucked a rock in the pen and a pig squealed.\u201d | Politics", "authors": ["Charles Hurt"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/05/nuclear-option.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
