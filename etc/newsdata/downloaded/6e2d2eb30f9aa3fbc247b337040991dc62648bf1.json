Japan Post Insurance has suspended sales of insurance policies.\n\nThe admissions cast a shadow over the government\u2019s plan to sell $10 billion worth of its shares in parent Japan Post Holdings to pay for reconstruction in areas hit by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.\n\nJapan Post Insurance had said in August it possibly sold a total of about 183,000 insurance policies that could have been disadvantageous to policy holders, over the five years through fiscal 2018.\n\nIt said on Monday most of the cases that fell foul of the law involved false explanations provided to customers. The company has so far scrutinized about 68,020 cases, accounting for about 37% of total misconduct, it said, releasing an interim report on the investigation.\n\n\u201cI will lead from the front to restore our trust from customers,\u201d Mitsuhiko Uehira, president of Japan Post Insurance, said at a news conference. He, Masatsugu Nagato, chief executive at Japan Post Holdings, and other senior executives who attended the briefing, bowed in apology.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to investigate with the view that even a single case of misconduct cannot be tolerated,\u201d Uehira said.\n\nOnce their internal investigation is concluded, Japan Post Insurance will consider imposing punishments such as disqualifying insurance agents who violated law or internal rules, the company said.\n\nWhile it had aimed to restart selling insurance policies in October, the company postponed it to January 2020.\n\nThe Financial Services Agency\u2019s (FSA) division that monitors Japan Post Group declined to comment as the investigation is not over.\n\nJapan Post Insurance shares have slumped about 20% since July, while Japan Post Holdings and Japan Post Bank shares have fallen 16% and 6%, respectively, over the same period.\n\nThe group\u2019s U.S. affiliate Aflac\u2019s (AFL.N) shares have also fallen since the news of the misconduct emerged on worries about its sales in Japan.", "description": "Japan Post Insurance Co Ltd <7181.T> said on Monday it discovered 6,327 cases of improper sales in a previously flagged misconduct matter that is still under investigation and that 1,400 cases among them are suspected of violating the law.", "authors": ["Takashi Umekawa", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
