Now, CNBC reports that Luckey\u2019s company, named Anduril after a sword from The Lord of the Rings, is already valued at $1 billion.\n\nAccording to CNBC, blue chip venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is throwing some money into the mix, participating in a fresh round of fundraising for Anduril\u2019s booming surveillance technology hardware suite.\n\nThe company has already installed its technology on the Southern U.S. border through a deal with Customs and Border Protection and inked a $13.5 million contract with the Marine Corps to build a \u201cdigital fortress\u201d around bases in Arizona, Hawaii, and Japan.\n\nAnduril\u2019s early investors include Peter Thiel\u2019s investment firm Founders Fund, which the company is connected to through Anduril co-founder and chairman Trae Stephens, a partner at the firm.\n\nLuckey famously sold his virtual reality hardware company Oculus to Facebook for $3 billion in 2014. Oculus was two years old and had a staff of about 100 people at the time, much like Anduril today.\n\nThe reasons for Luckey\u2019s ouster from Facebook remain unclear but Lucky himself has echoed some Republicans in suggesting he was axed over his financial support for the pro-Trump group Nimble America, telling CNBC in May that his $10,000 donation probably had \u201csomething to do with\u201d his firing. The Daily Beast previously reported that Luckey financially backed the pro-Trump non-profit, which was committed to circulating disparaging memes about Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election.", "description": "CNBC reports that Andreessen Horowitz is part of a new fundraising round for the young defense company.", "authors": ["Taylor Hatmaker", "Senior Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568236383/RTX1G4QY_1_zjzfh6", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
