Started as an annual activity by Richard Hunter, the then Deputy Secretary General of the World Federation for Mental Health, a mental health organisation with members and contacts in more than 150 countries, until 1994, this day had no theme other than promoting and advocating mental health.\n\n\n\nIn 1994, the day was celebrated with a theme for the first time, that of \u2018Improving the Quality of Mental Health Services throughout the World\u2019, at the suggestion of then Secretary General, Eugene Brody.\n\nOrganised by the World Federation for Mental Health annually, the overall aim is to raise awareness of mental health issues and mobilise efforts in support of mental health. The day also provides all stakeholders working on mental health issues an opportunity to talk about their work and what more can be done for people to realise the importance of mental health care.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year\u2019s theme is \u2018Suicide Prevention\u2019, with the objective to attract the attention of governments so that this issue can be prioritised in public health agendas around the world. This year\u2019s World Mental Health Day is supported by WHO, the International Association for Suicide Prevention, and United for Global Mental Health.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental health is important for overall wellness, and mental health issues need to be looked at just as any other health condition. Often, stigma or simply not knowing when to get help can come in the way of the road to recovery. Early intervention can minimise or delay symptoms, prevent hospitalisation, and improve prognosis.\n\nHere are some signs and symptoms that may indicate the need for evaluation by a medical practitioner:\n\nDramatic sleep or appetite changes and decline in personal care\n\nRapid or dramatic changes in mood and emotions; depressed feelings\n\nRecent social withdrawal and loss of interest in activities that were previously enjoyable\n\nUnusual drop in functioning at school, work, or social activities\n\nProblems with concentration, memory, or logical thought and speech\n\nHeightened sensitivity to sights, sounds, smells or touch\n\nApathy and feeling disconnected\n\nIllogical thinking\n\nNervousness and unusual, peculiar behaviour\n\nIf you know someone who might need medical assistance, encourage them to get evaluated by a mental health professional and learn about mental illness and signs and symptoms. Receiving support and counselling can help with stress management while close monitoring might be required for those who need intensive care.", "description": "Understand the importance of World Mental Health Day and recognise early signs and symptoms of mental illness.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/sthhealth1570699056.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
