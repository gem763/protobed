Her complaint against Lauer led to his firing in 2017, but NBC News kept her identity anonymous, at her request, and the details of her allegations against Lauer had not been made public.\n\nIn the book, Nevils alleges that Lauer anally raped her in his hotel room at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nOn Wednesday, Lauer told Variety the accusation is \u201ccategorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense.\u201d He called the encounter an \u201cextramarital affair.\u201d Read his entire statement here.\n\nMatt Lauer on the Today show in 2017 prior to his firing amid sexual misconduct allegations.

While having drinks at the hotel bar, they saw Lauer, who joined them.\n\nNevils, who says she had six shots of vodka during the night, ended up going to Lauer\u2019s room later that night. First to pick up her press credential, which Lauer took as a joke. She returned a second time after he invited her.\n\nWhile Nevils said she \u201chad no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience,\u201d she told Farrow that when she returned, she found him in his boxers and T-shirt, and he pushed her on the bed and asked if she likes anal sex, Variety\u2019s report claims.\n\nNevils said she declined multiple times, but Lauer \u201cjust did it,\u201d Farrow wrote in the book. She said she cried the whole time and was in terrible pain.\n\n\u201cIt was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,\u201d Nevils told Farrow. \u201cIt was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u201d\n\nWhen they returned to New York, Nevils said she had more sexual encounters with Lauer despite what occurred in Sochi, Variety reports. However, she told Farrow it was \u201ccompletely transactional\u201d and \u201cnot a relationship.\u201d\n\nFarrow wrote, \u201cWhat is not in dispute is that Nevils, like several of the women I\u2019d spoken to, had further sexual encounters with the man she said assaulted her.\u201d She told Farrow, \u201c\u2018This is what I blame myself most for.\u201d\n\nNevils said she told multiple people at NBC what happened, including colleagues as well as superiors. Farrow wrote that \u201cit was no secret.\u201d However, nothing happened until 2017 \u2014 after the women started coming forward against Harvey Weinstein. Nevils said she told Vieira for the first time and she urged Nevils to go to HR with her attorney. Nevils did and Lauer was fired soon after for \u201cinappropriate workplace behavior.\u201d\n\nWhile the company kept her identity a secret, Nevils said colleagues knew it was her and it became impossible for her to work. She went on medical leave in 2018 and was eventually paid \u201cseven figures.\u201d\n\nAfter Variety\u2019s story came out, Lauer issued a lengthy statement through his lawyer to Variety.\n\nIt addressed his relative silence since his firing, explaining that he hasn\u2019t been defending himself \u201cmore vigorously against some of the false and salacious allegations leveled at me\u201d because all it does is \u201ccreate more headlines my kids would read and a new gathering of photographers at the end of our driveway.\u201d But he said he now feels his \u201csilence has become a mistake.\u201d\n\nLauer went on to say he \u201chad an extramarital affair with Brooke Nevils in 2014. It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia.\u201d He detailed which sexual acts he said they performed on each other and said, \u201cEach act was mutual and completely consensual.\u201d\n\nHe said Nevils\u2019s story is \u201cfilled with false details intended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter. Nothing could be further from the truth. There was absolutely nothing aggressive about that encounter. Brooke did not do or say anything to object. She certainly did not cry. She was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner. At no time did she behave in a way that made it appear she was incapable of consent. She seemed to know exactly what she wanted to do. The only concern she expressed was that someone might see her leaving my room. She embraced me at the door as she left.\u201d", "description": "The former NBC employee whose complaint led to \"Today\" anchor's firing tells her story in new book.
