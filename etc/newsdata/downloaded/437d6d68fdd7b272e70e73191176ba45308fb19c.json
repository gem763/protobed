GOP Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota agreed, adding that \u201cbacking impeachment will cost Democrats their [House] majority in 2020.\u201d And even conservative pundit Ross Douthat, who is no Trump fan, presented New York Times readers Tuesday with \u201cfour reasons the president might welcome articles of impeachment.\u201d\n\nDo they have a point? Or is this just, to coin a phrase, whistleblowing past the graveyard?\n\nPresident Richard Nixon addresses the Associated Press Managing Editors' annual meeting in 1973, where he told the press \"I am not a crook.\" (Photo: AP) More\n\nTrump\u2019s logic is pretty straightforward. Impeachment is, and always has been, unpopular. It was unpopular in early 1973, when Gallup polling showed that only 19 percent of Americans supported removing President Richard Nixon from office. It was unpopular in January 1999, when Gallup polling showed that only 32 percent of Americans supported removing President Bill Clinton. And it\u2019s been unpopular in every poll taken since the start of 2017, with an average of 38.5 percent of the public favoring impeachment and 55.7 percent opposing it. Independents are particularly unenthusiastic: 28 percent for vs. 62 percent against, according to a recent Marist poll.\n\nThe theory, then, is that the American people will rise up and reject the Democratic push for impeachment \u2014 or at least Republicans and independents will, and the backlash will spur turnout for Trump and the GOP in 2020. Fans of this theory usually cite the 1998 midterms. Usually, the party that doesn\u2019t control the presidency gains ground in the midterms. But in November 1998, with Clinton in the White House, it was Democrats who netted five House seats, and exit polls showed that voters were wary of the GOP\u2019s impeachment effort.\n\nYet there are a few reasons to be skeptical about the \u201csame thing\u201d happening again in 2020. The first is that impeachment wasn\u2019t, in fact, an unalloyed victory for Clinton. Democrats may have flipped a few seats in 1998, but they didn\u2019t flip the House. Two years later, Vice President Al Gore distanced himself from Clinton. Republican George W. Bush ran on restoring decency to the White House. Both sides saw impeachment as a negative.", "description": "There are many things that can derail a political career.
