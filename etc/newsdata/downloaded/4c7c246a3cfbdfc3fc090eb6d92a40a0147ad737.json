The accused were each granted R3 000 for bail.\n\nThe investigation stems from the case of 46-year-old Carol Ann Avent, who was employed as a bookkeeper in a Nelspruit-based company.\n\nSekgotodi said she allegedly created false beneficiaries and transferred company funds into different accounts belonging to her family members. This happened during the period 2010 and 2016, said Sekgotodi.\n\nCarol Ann was arrested in 2016 and charged on 1 150 counts of fraud and was later released on R5 000 bail. She was found guilty but is yet to be sentenced, Sekgotodi said.\n\nShe will join her co-accused in the Nelspruit Regional Court on November 5.", "description": "Four people were arrested after they allegedly benefited from a fraud scheme involving R11.5m, Mpumalanga Hawks said this week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9044/121d713ec1ec404485009b9a241f5e90.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
