The fighting, which began in November 1939 and ended in a Russian victory in mid-March, was fiercest along Finland\u2019s eastern border, in Karelia. Distance \u201cDo you see?\u201d my father said. I breathed in and out, the air shallow in my chest. I was 10. On the way back from his dawn hunt, my father had sliced the tip off a reindeer antler and placed it somewhere in the array of space and field behind our cabin. My job was to find it. We were on our stomachs in the snow, under the stand of trees where, in summer, our horse Teemu lowered his gray face in the shade. We\u2019d been here for two hours, waiting while I looked and looked for the tip, which would be our target. \u201cYes?\u201d my father said. I nodded. \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cThe fang,\u201d I said. This was the shattered birch trunk that had split the year before last in a storm and now stood, jagged and lonely, at the edge of the far field. \u201cWell, five steps before it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow far from our position?\u201d he said. He would aim only and exactly as I instructed. Such was his test. \u201cOne hundred forty-eight meters,\u201d I said. My father turned his round, dull eyes to me. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d I nodded. \u201cGo mark it, then,\u201d he said, and moved the rifle from where it lay between us. Progress was slow in the snow. As I approached the fang, the sun hit the ice covering the old silver wood and made it sharp with light. I turned and faced the place I knew my father was, though you\u2019d never be able to see him, not if you looked for a whole month. I counted five steps back toward him and stopped. The shot rang like a bell in the frozen clearing that pocketed the cabin and the shed and our two fields. The spray of ice shards hit my face so hard that I fell backwards, and I stared at the place where the bullet had obliterated the tiny piece of antler, poking maybe five centimeters above the snow, just between my feet. If I\u2019d said 149 meters, or taken six steps instead of five, my father\u2019s round would\u2019ve passed through my stomach. When I got back to the cabin, he was already inside, the rifle half-disassembled. \u201cOne hundred forty-eight meters,\u201d he said, and glanced at me before going back to wiping the bolt, which was as close as he ever got to good cheer. Then he said what he always said. \u201cYou\u2019re only wrong once, Simuna.\u201d The White Death The Russians, as was their wont, had their own name for me, the White Death. My men called me the Magic Shooter, which I also hated. I am Simo H\u00e4yh\u00e4, corporal of the Sixth Battalion, Regiment 34; previously of Bicycle Battalions 1 (Third Company) and 2 (First Company); previously of the Civil Guard volunteers, all in service to the glorious and proud Finnish cause. Or I was, anyway, until 1940, when everything (we thought) was over and it turned out I was in fact still alive, and someone decided to make me a second lieutenant for it. It was M who first called me Kettuseni, \u201cmy little fox.\u201d When I think of those 98 days in the forest, I hear only that name. I\u2019ve liked only two nicknames in my entire life. My father and mother both called me Simuna, which means \u201cGod has listened,\u201d though I suspect what they each imagined he heard was different. It was M, though, who first called me Kettuseni, \u201cmy little fox.\u201d When I think of those 98 days in the forest, I hear only that name. When I dream of M now, I wake myself sometimes, the sound of it floating around the room, before I understand that my own lips uttered it.\n\nOur regiment commander, Lieutenant Juutilainen, was known far and wide as the Terror of Morocco, due to his time there with the French Foreign Legion, fighting the Berbers in the Atlas Mountains. We ourselves called him Papa. He was a quiet man with a sad, clownish face who spent most of his time drinking in his officer\u2019s tent, where it was warmest and where he let me sleep between my hunts. This was more or less how he\u2019d spent his time in the Atlases too, I gathered: drinking to stay warm in the frigid air, then venturing out for a whole day of stalking the slopes with his rifle and skis. By the time the Soviets shelled Mainila, though, his flurries of activity took place in the command tent. When the Russians began pouring toward our lines, and Major General H\u00e4gglund asked his famous question, I myself watched as Papa gave his famous response: \u201cYes, Kollaa holds. Unless our orders are to run away.\u201d Once, two days after Christmas, we managed to capture a sorry Russian who\u2019d gotten lost and wandered almost right into our camp. He didn\u2019t even have a weapon. We blindfolded him, spun him around until he was so dizzy that he could barely stand, then marched him in circles, telling him the whole time that we were taking him to the Terror of Morocco. By the time we brought him into the tent and took off his blindfold, he was shaking with fear and Papa insisted we drink with him all night. Whether thanks to the spirits or our company, he came back to life in front of us. Before dawn we marched him off toward his own lines, pointed him where to go, and set him loose. He cried the whole way, begging to stay. A month later, when we retook those woods, M told me he found the man, frozen stiff, propped against a tree where his own officer had shot him in the forehead for deserting.\n\nThe Zero I was born the last of four brothers, too young to join them in the civil war when it came in early 1918. Antti was shot through the nasal cavity by a Red Guard marksman on a drizzly evening in Tampere. Juhana was wounded in the close fighting at Joutseno, and taken prisoner. By that time, the Reds had heard about the prison camp and mass grave at Kalevankangas. I was 12. Spring brought the German Imperials to the streets of Helsinki and the Whites to Vyborg, victorious. In May, the Whites took Fort Ino, near the Neva Bay, on the Karelian Isthmus. The war was over, and finally Juhana was returned to us. The power of speech had deserted him, and we were all left to imagine exactly what had driven it away. He was only good for fieldwork by then. Summer came, and Mother sang Tuomas and me psalms in the evening while she mended our clothes. Antti was gone, Juhana was just beginning to work again, and I was needed around the farm to help Father with the timber, so it was Tuomas who was sent to the road project at Miettil\u00e4 to work. The summer was brutal, and each time Tuomas returned from the work site on the weekends, he looked more shrunken and sallow. The foreman himself came all the way out to the farm to tell my father about the afternoon, the hottest anyone could remember\u2014about the way Tuomas had straightened up as if someone had called his name, before crumpling to the ground with sunstroke. Then he was gone too.\n\nThat winter, during the few hours of morning light, my father set a single bullet upright on the table in front of me, before sending me out with my rifle. I carried the round inside my glove as I walked, and felt the brass get hot and slick in my palm. If you can\u2019t do it with one, I\u2019d heard him tell Antti, you can\u2019t do it with two. In the first week, I missed my shot two days in a row, and each night my father made me sit at the table as everyone else ate potatoes from the cellar, my plate empty in front of me. My father wouldn\u2019t look at me. My mother wouldn\u2019t look at him. On the third day, hunger had sharpened my senses. I disappeared into the woods; time disappeared into the day. I came back in the dark with two hares. I\u2019d waited, lying alongside a log, until they passed one in front of the other. My father met me on the porch, and pulled me into an embrace so rough I thought at first he was wrestling me. I could smell the cold and the forest on the stiff hide of his overcoat. Then he took me by the shoulders and held me away from him so that he could look into my face. He took a breath as if to tell me something, but said nothing. I did not miss again. I always kept my rifle zeroed at 150 meters. If you can\u2019t get within 150 meters of a kill, my father used to say, you don\u2019t deserve to make it. The same was true 20 years later, in those frozen woods with M. Whenever there was a lull, I found a dwarf pine on a slope and watched the top of it disappear in a puff of snow. You could tell when you\u2019d missed or just hit the ice, instead of the trunk. I never missed.\n\nRolling Hell M came wheeling around the bend on his bicycle, singing. This was the first time I ever met him. He was reporting for the marksman training camp. We\u2019d been paired together, and I was sitting on the firing platform with the other shooters, waiting for the spotters. M could be almost as silent as me when he wanted, but this was just before the war, and he sang at the top of his lungs. He had a deep, dark river of a voice, and even then I closed my eyes and let it wash over me. When we were in position for the first drill, I patiently waited for him to give the usual range, wind condition, firing pattern, etc. But he didn\u2019t. Instead he lay on his back with his head against the sandbag and closed his eyes to the sun. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to inform me?\u201d I said to him. He spoke without opening his eyes. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d I said. He shrugged. \u201cI know who you are,\u201d he said. I blew air between my teeth, exasperated. I thought he was impudent. \u201cDo you need me to tell you?\u201d he said. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. He tipped his cap over his face. \u201cRange?\u201d I said. I couldn\u2019t believe his impertinence, his laziness. M only sighed, and didn\u2019t move. \u201cRange 1-9-2 meters,\u201d I said, testing him. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbecoming.\u201d \u201cRange 2-1-1 meters,\u201d I said. \u201cCorrect,\u201d he said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that feel better?\u201d We were silent. I went through my routine and waited so long that I thought for sure he\u2019d fallen asleep. I fired my first round at the target.\n\n\u201cHit,\u201d M said quietly, as if to himself. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even look,\u201d I said. \u201cI listened,\u201d he said. Later in our training, when new groups would arrive at the camp, they\u2019d ask who he and I were. All the other marksman teams had taken up code names by then to confuse the Russians. Silent Doom. Death From the Trees. That sort of thing. M and I refused. Soon enough everyone would have a name for me anyway. But when the new recruits would arrive and see M and me returning from the supply depot, singing together on our bicycles, weaving over the ruts, laughing and gamboling like two fawns, they\u2019d sneer, \u201cAnd what are you, oh fearsome brothers?\u201d And M would put his arm around my shoulders and grin. \u201cOh, us?\u201d he\u2019d say, a crown of daffodils chained around his hat. \u201cWe\u2019re Rolling Hell.\u201d Winter began, and the big cogs of the world around us turned toward war. We were to have one last break before heading to the front. Many of the men went home. M and I both loved the forest and decided instead to go hiking for all four days. He\u2019d spent a lot of time out there as a child and told me he knew an unmarked path. The first day he drove us hard, casting a look back at me only occasionally to see whether I was keeping up. He barely spoke to me, and my heart began to feel like a sharp piece of steel. I imagined a firing mechanism exploding from a homemade round\u2014the jagged pieces of barrel and stock. It began snowing as we pitched our tent, and though I was exhausted, I lay awake in the dark.\n\nThe next morning was clear and bright. M took my hand and led me out to the middle of the frozen lake we\u2019d camped beside in the night. The snowfall had turned it into a pure white field. \u201cWell?\u201d I said. I wanted to go home. I felt embarrassed. But M\u2019s face was bright, happy, flashing with something. He dropped to his knees and made big sweeping motions with his arms, clearing the surface of the ice. I thought I was dreaming. Suddenly we were standing on air. On ice so perfectly clear, it might have been air. Fifty feet below, I could see the algae on the stones at the bottom of the lake. \u201cIt only happens when the water freezes very, very slowly,\u201d M said. \u201cThe winter has to be so patient, and then one day there it is, a miracle.\u201d He looked at me, letting out his breath. \u201cI thought you\u2019d like that.\u201d Later, of course, I would come to know well the scent of him\u2014rich soil and tobacco and sweat\u2014carried under his snow cape and coat and uniform. His taste. The rough scratch of his stubble and its delicious burn. But when we were out in the silent hours upon hours of our hunts, when we lay behind an embankment and waited for the first suggestion of dawn, breathing slowly and evenly to reduce moisture plumes and to lower our body temperatures, I thought only of that morning. Laughing and falling on each other. Shuffling around in the impossible clarity of that place.\n\nAlexandre Luu\n\nDistance The winter makes everything itself, I told M the day we found the black wall of bodies. He\u2019d spent a lot of time in the brush as a child, it was true, but the rest of the time he lived in the city, and at first he didn\u2019t understand what we were looking at. We\u2019d heard there\u2019d been heavy fighting right away, but there were few roads in our area, and the Russians quickly found themselves stalled in pockets of the forest as we crept around them.\n\nThe clearing\u2014a meadow in summer\u2014was dim and quiet. Our boys had set up their machine-gun positions among the trees, where they would have clear lines of fire but couldn\u2019t be spotted. The Russians had made their camp in the middle of the open space, for who knew what reason. This was at the beginning. We didn\u2019t yet know how unprepared they were to fight. Some didn\u2019t even have winter clothes. Only the officers had real tents. The rest made do with improvised shelters, anywhere they could hover around their tiny fires, a tidy constellation of targets. At whatever cue, they\u2019d been ordered to charge out toward the trees, where the men were felled, one atop another, by the machine guns. That winter was so cold\u2014colder than any of us had ever seen. So cold that the blood from the newest layers of bodies turned black and froze over the bodies stacked at the bottom. There wasn\u2019t much snowfall, and the blackened wall of blood and bodies seemed orderly in the half-light of the day. M and I stood and looked at it for a long time. Some of our fleeing units had hauled even more frozen Russian bodies out of the woods and propped them upright, their arms stilled in various eerie semaphore. The world is never very big. A map is just a piece of paper. My Karelia was just a corridor of wild land north of the vast waters of Lake Ladoga. You could be at the shore in a day on foot if you wanted. You could be at my father\u2019s cabin in four. That day in the clearing we were something like 200 kilometers from the center of Leningrad, imagine. But the forest is endless. The winter stopped everything with its cold, even space.\n\nNear the end, in our last week of war, only a few days before I was shot, we passed back through this clearing\u2014a rare thing in a place where you could never trace the same path twice, even with careful planning. We were retreating, everyone could see it was over, and things were bad. I\u2019d gone on my last hunt days before. Some of our fleeing units in their bitterness had hauled even more frozen Russian bodies out of the woods and propped them upright, their arms stilled in various eerie semaphore. The idea was to disturb the Russians before they overran us. Those corpses were black too, and they made the clearing look like the stunted remains of a wildfire. They were all facing the black wall and looked strangely as though they were trying to join their friends. My father used to say, If you need a map to know where you are, you\u2019re already lost. Both times we passed through the clearing we paused. Then we kept going. That first time, as we reentered the forest, M nodded to the horizon, where the sun was lurking, as high as it would get that day, a thin, golden-red line of color. \u201cThe sky is burning,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a waste.\u201d The Hunt It was so cold that if your eyes got too close to the holes of the mask, your corneas froze. So cold that you needed a body within your body. Papa measured the temperature by planting one of his bottles in the snowbank outside his tent: If the alcohol turned to slush it was about \u201325 Celsius or below. At those temperatures, nobody moved but us. M and I would sleep through the few hours of weak light, then rise and head out as the forest gathered the darkness. Once we\u2019d found a Russian camp, we would sit and wait until we were part of the stillness. Then I\u2019d pick a position.\n\nWe\u2019d urinate on the berm of snow, letting it freeze so the muzzle flash wouldn\u2019t kick up any powder for the Russians to see. If we could make a snow cave or small space under the eaves of a tree, we would, and I\u2019d sit there and watch the woods in front of us while M slept or lay there staring up at nothing, waiting. We\u2019d trained ourselves to breathe slowly and carefully, keeping the moisture in the mask. Otherwise our breath would billow out and become a solid thing in the air. We had whole conversations made of just the wind, a sideways movement of iris that seemed to catch what little light there was. It wasn\u2019t hard to see the Russians. We were always close, 150 meters or less. They tried to make their camps where they could take cover behind low piles of deadfall or snow or whatever they could find. To make a perfect shot, you have to know every bit of the woods around you. You have to disappear into the air, to become the weight of the hard rime making the trees into statues. Then it would be time. M watched me take off my outer gloves\u2014knit\u2014which I placed under the barrel to smooth the recoil. Then he watched me take off my mask. I put snow in my mouth to keep my breath invisible. I had about 10 minutes before the flesh of my face would freeze. I\u2019d nod to M and we\u2019d both face the target field. A scope isn\u2019t the world, my father said on my last trip home before I went to war. What do you see through a scope? Nothing. A picture. So I used the iron sights, as I had since I was a child. What do you see down the iron sights? Everything, as it is. The minuscule area of pale color that was a Russian face. The solid dark of a Russian\u2019s torso. I fired and the shapes fell with small mists spraying out behind. The first shot was confusion for them, the second brought shouting, the third panic. Then a kind of stillness as they waited to see whether the cover they\u2019d found would be enough to save them. Another mad scramble after the fourth shot. Then a wait, the skin of my own face losing feeling. A minute of quiet. Then a sliver of head, or movement; a ventured look out to try to see. The fifth shot always occasioned the strangest of the reactions. Once in a while a man cried. Twice a Russian bellowed with terror and madness. But I was already back behind the berm, in my mask, breathing, not even hurrying to refill my magazine. I was never spotted. I didn\u2019t have a body. The forest was my body. My rounds came from anywhere. The men looked and saw only whiteness. The wolves scattered the bones, starting that first spring, their faces perpetually crimson with the offal of the corpses. A long wait, stillness, silence. The Russians tended to their casualties, believing I\u2019d fled. I\u2019d wait impossibly long, until the few hours of daylight began to wane. And then in that frozen twilight, we\u2019d repeat the process. Then we\u2019d wait even longer before we crawled away. By the time we returned to our camp and stepped into Papa\u2019s tent, the frozen creases of our furs under our snow capes would be sharp as knives. We\u2019d sip warm soup from his stove and M would record the kills in the captain\u2019s little book. Then Papa would go out to stalk the camp\u2019s perimeter, and sleep would come like a coup de gr\u00e2ce.\n\nMany years afterward, during a fox hunt led by the president of Finland himself, he requested that I show the group some of my firing positions. It was autumn then, 1970, and a different universe of trees and leaves and fallen logs. \u201cIs this what you remember?\u201d the president asked, crouching and looking down my rifle with me. \u201cWhat did it feel like? How did you wait for so long?\u201d M\u2019s eyes were all that were visible of him as we both lay back under the tree or against the berm, buried together in the snow. The solid feel of his body there beside me. We had whole conversations made of just the wind, a sideways movement of iris that seemed to catch what little light there was. Between magazines, M would stay awake, watching to see whether the Russians would send a patrol out to find our position, and I would gaze up at him and think, Look at me. Look at me. Wolves of Karelia The wolves ate well that first spring after the fighting, and the next spring, and the next, it\u2019s true. For 10 years after the war, their population grew uncontrollably, and packs traveled all the way to the farm. I had returned; it was just me and my father by then. He insisted on hunting, though he\u2019d grown old and slow. I would sit on the roof of the cabin and watch him coming home, sometimes with a kill, sometimes not. In either case, the wolves would be following at a careful distance. I\u2019d see them coalesce into being out of the shadows of the trees. They did not, as far as I know, ever attack, though they easily could have. Still, they did follow him every day, at their distance, waiting for him to fall. My father never hunted wolves. He thought it disrespectful.\n\nThe wolves scattered the bones, starting that first spring, their faces perpetually crimson with the offal of the corpses. In later years, when I\u2019d go out hunting again, I\u2019d find a bone here and there: a jagged femur, the marrow sucked out; the little puzzle of a vertebra, so weathered and so cold that if you found it midwinter, it would shatter at the touch of a boot\u2019s toe. On the day my father didn\u2019t come back from his hunt, I went out to find him. He wasn\u2019t hard to track and hadn\u2019t gotten very far. I shot every wolf I saw on my way to retrieve his body. Instead of dragging and cleaning the carcasses, I just left them there to mark his trail\u2014a long, loose corridor of the dead. As soon as he was buried, I found an apartment in the city on a rise that looked out over the lake. The forest looked small and still from there, nothing really to see. I hunted only foxes after that. \u201cFive hundred and forty-two confirmed kills,\u201d the occasional reporter says now, when one comes to visit. \u201cWhat does that feel like?\u201d \u201cOnly 259 were with the rifle,\u201d I tell them. \u201cThe rest were submachine. I don\u2019t know how they counted those.\u201d \u201cStill,\u201d they press. \u201cDo you ever think of it?\u201d I don\u2019t, really, to tell the truth. Not that I tell them that, or much of anything. I do dream of the wolves sometimes, though. I see them just as I fall asleep. I\u2019m standing alone outside the cabin, and they fill every gap across the field, where the forest begins. None of us moves, and I know they are waiting for me. Alexandre Luu The 98th Day Running. Our breathing the only sound in the woods. It was the first week of March. In February, the Russians had run out of patience. They poured half a million troops onto the isthmus, 3,000 tanks, 1,300 aircraft. We were maybe 75,000 men in total. M and I had decided to go on one last hunt but had not gone far before we heard and then saw the dark wave, streaming like water toward us from every direction. So we ran back to our men.\n\nIn front of us, our unit\u2019s trench appeared and the men were yelling and we were leaping over the embankment and turning to fire, as was everyone else. Then the Russians were upon us. Flesh came apart around us. I looked to M as he reloaded and I watched a round tear through his torso sideways, taking him to the ground, just like that. I\u2019d only just turned to fire when suddenly I was on the ground too. I felt something hot and wet in my mouth before I lost consciousness. An explosive bullet had torn through the left side of my jaw, I found out later. Illegal, even in war, but the Russians were desperate, and had half-convinced themselves we were invisible, ghosts, immortal. I\u2019m told I was dragged to the rear in the retreat\u2014they tried to save me even though, as one of the men put it, half my face was gone. I\u2019m told I was thrown on a pile of the dead before someone heard me gurgling and got me to the medics. My coma lasted seven days. I woke on the day the armistice was signed, giving Russia our Karelia and everything else it wanted. It was March 12, 1940. We thought we\u2019d seen the end of war. It was three years before I recovered enough to go out in public. Still, I tried not to. I stayed on the farm. People who saw me looked away, their faces rippling with nausea. Even now, at night, it still looks as if the darkness is pulling at the edge of my face, leaving a jagged edge of skin and flesh\u2014as if I\u2019m already half-gone.\n\nThe Heart Hunts Alone I found M in a military hospital. He was still there, three years after we were shot, in the city. He was what they called then a \u201cpermanent,\u201d having survived but with lungs that needed to be drained often enough that the doctors believed he\u2019d be there forever. I sat in the chair by his bed. It was summer and the sheets were very white. He was almost unrecognizable, a heavy beard turning his eyes sharp and dark. What was the difference, really, between my presence and an awful dream? \u201cYou\u2019ve grown a beard,\u201d I said. \u201cI just grow shrapnel.\u201d Which was true. I felt the burning itch of it as the flesh and skin worked the bits to the surface, where they\u2019d fall into the washbasin, trailing a tiny ribbon of blood. He looked not at me, but at the ceiling. \u201cThe Terror made it through,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you believe that?\u201d I looked at my hands and nodded. \u201cTerror always does,\u201d I said. \u201cCan you believe they gave away Vyborg?\u201d M said, as if it had just happened. A nurse came by to check something, and we sat quietly until she was gone. \u201cI might live in the city now,\u201d I said. \u201cI might get an apartment.\u201d M didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cLet me take you home,\u201d I said. \u201cI will bring you back for the treatments, easy enough.\u201d M turned on his side away from me. I could see his jaw held tightly. I\u2019d forgotten, somehow, what I looked like. How monstrous. The slurred sound of my voice. What was the difference, really, between my presence and an awful dream?", "description": "A short story", "authors": ["Arna Bontemps Hemenway"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/07/FIC_Wolves_lead/facebook.jpg?1562007516"}
