Since Fox first started putting the score on the screen all the time in 1994 (yes kids, old folks lived in a world in which you had to remember the score because it wasn\u2019t pinned on the bottom of our screens), networks have gotten in the habit of alerting us when there\u2019s a penalty flag on the play. It usually would pop up as a bright yellow graphic where the score is listed.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nIn the first haalf, ESPN had that yellow tag on all the time, even when there was not a flag on the play.\n\nThe NFL graphics revamp by ESPN\u2019s Creative Services team includes a new #MNF dashboard this season. A notable addition is the neon yellow \u201cvenom\u201d color. Great work by @coolhand20 and company. pic.twitter.com/AwjVWfrG2O \u2014 bill hofheimer (@bhofheimer_espn) September 9, 2019\n\nGive ESPN credit, because they didn\u2019t need a day of reflection and meetings tot get it right. It was changed after halftime, back to a normal black background and white lettering.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur ESPN production team is aware of the feedback on the #MNF down and distance graphic. We have called an audible and adjusted for the 2nd half of #HOUvsNO and for the #DENvsOAK game to follow. New look pictured here. pic.twitter.com/SWLKKuW87w \u2014 bill hofheimer (@bhofheimer_espn) September 10, 2019\n\nSocial media was not happy with yellow graphic\n\nAll you had to do in the first half was watch Saints receiver Michael Thomas make a catch, see the yellow on the bottom right, think it was coming back ... no, no, just first-and-10 on ESPN\u2019s screen. Ugh.\n\nSocial media was not impressed.\n\nESPN needs to change the yellow graphic on the bottom right of the screen. I keep thinking it\u2019s a flag. Whose idea was this? \u2014 Landry Locker (@LandryLocker) September 9, 2019\n\nImma need @ESPNNFL /@espn to change the yellow color of that banner next week, I keep thinking there\u2019s flags being thrown, and we all know that\u2019s a sensitive subject down here #WhoDat #HOUvsNO #MondayNightFootball \u2014 katie (@katie32543202) September 9, 2019\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t ESPN stick to the red graphics? The yellow is god awful and makes me think there\u2019s a flag on every play. \u2014 Jesse Finver (@JfinverSports12) September 9, 2019\n\nAt least it lasted only one half. ESPN quickly got it right.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
