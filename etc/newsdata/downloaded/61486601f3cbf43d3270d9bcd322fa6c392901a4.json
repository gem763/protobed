The official said the State Department was also attempting to limit any testimony that did occur, and that Mr. Reeker was complying with the subpoena and answering questions.\n\nMr. Reeker was named to the job in March, around the time Mr. Trump ordered the removal of Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others had accused Ms. Yovanovitch of undermining the president abroad and of obstructing efforts to persuade Kyiv to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nMs. Yovanovitch \u201cwas a primary concern from his first week on the job,\u201d the person familiar said, relaying Mr. Reeker\u2019s position on the issue.\n\nThe events surrounding the decision to hold up aid to Ukraine are a central focus of the House impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and has called the probe a witch hunt.\n\nThe State Department didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRep. Stephen Lynch (D., Mass.), a member of the House Oversight Committee, said Saturday afternoon that the panels were learning more from Mr. Reeker than they had anticipated, extending the length of the deposition. He declined to elaborate on the substance of Mr. Reeker\u2019s testimony.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s being helpful in some respects, he is corroborating previous witnesses and their testimony,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a much richer reservoir of information that we originally expected.\u201d\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), a top ally of the president\u2019s on Capitol Hill, said that Mr. Reeker is a minor player in the overall Ukraine saga. He also declined to comment on the substance of Mr. Reeker\u2019s testimony.\n\n\u201cUkraine was one of dozens of countries that he oversees, so to the extent he was copied on an email here or there, that\u2019s pretty much his involvement,\u201d Mr. Meadows said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said in his prepared testimony Mr. Trump made nearly $400 million in aid contingent on the Ukrainian president investigating Mr. Biden and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Democrats who heard the testimony called it damning, while some Republicans argued that there was nothing new in it.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should have shown more support for Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Taylor also said in his testimony that he grew concerned about dual channels through which the Trump administration was conducting foreign policy toward Kyiv\u2014one through the State Department and an unofficial one involving Mr. Giuliani.\n\nMr. Reeker was named to his current role when there were rumblings of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s interference in Ukraine-related affairs, including efforts to have Ms. Yovanovitch removed from her post, but the ambassador was recalled almost as soon as he started in the job, and he was virtually powerless to stop it, the person familiar with his testimony said.\n\nMr. Reeker\u2019s deputy, George Kent, expressed concerns to him and later forwarded them to the State Department counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a close ally to Mr. Pompeo, and David Hale, the No. 3 official at the department, according to documents released to Congress by the State Department\u2019s inspector general.\n\nMr. Reeker, a 25-year friend of Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s, tried to rally support for her in the form of an internal letter, but was urged not to by Mr. Pompeo and other top State Department officials, who noted that Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s removal was a priority for the president, the person familiar with his testimony said.\n\nMichael McKinley, a former senior aide to Mr. Pompeo, testified earlier this month that he left his post over frustration with the secretary of state about the treatment of Ms. Yovanovitch, according to people familiar with the testimony.\n\nMs. Yovanovitch\u2019s removal from Kyiv in the spring has become a point of interest in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nPresident Trump's efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, have set off an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats.

Photo Composite: Laura Kammermann/The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Reeker\u2019s position requires constant travel, so much of the day-to-day Ukraine-related discussions were deferred to Mr. Kent, the person familiar with his testimony said, and policy matters were dominated by Kurt Volker, then the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine negotiations; Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union; Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Mr. Giuliani.\n\nHowever, the person said, Mr. Reeker became concerned when, during a July 31 policy coordination committee meeting at the White House, Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, raised concern over a hold on Ukraine aid by the White House and emphasized that the Pentagon was running out of time to release the funds before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nMr. Trump, in a July 25 call, asked his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, to \u201clook into\u201d Mr. Biden and his son and said he would direct Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to contact Mr. Zelensky to help him in a possible investigation, according to a rough transcript released by the White House.\n\nBefore asking Ukraine to examine actions by Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Mr. Trump reminded Mr. Zelensky that the U.S. sends security aid to Ukraine, according to the transcript, which was released in late September.\n\n\u2014Courtney McBride Andrew Duehren and Jesse Naranjo contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Vivian Salama at vivian.salama@wsj.com", "description": "A senior official was set to tell House impeachment investigators that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top officials stymied a show of solidarity for the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, according to a person familiar with his closed-door testimony.", "authors": ["Vivian Salama", "Vivian.Salama Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-118939/social", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
