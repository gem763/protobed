All summer, the Redskins, led by Gruden, were openly confident the unit had the right mix of youth and ability to win \u2014 even dominate \u2014 this season.\n\nBut in the NFL, talent only goes so far. And after the Redskins\u2019 31-21 loss Sunday to the Dallas Cowboys, Gruden had no explanation for why the defense that was supposed to be the team\u2019s strength continues to look like a liability.\n\n\u201cReally, we should be better than this,\u201d the coach said.\n\nThe reality of \u201cthis\u201d is the Redskins have allowed at least 30 points in each of their losses to two of their NFC East rivals. They\u2019ve given up an average of 455 yards across two games. And on third down, opponents are converting 64.2% of their opportunities.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s home opener at FedEx Field, the Redskins gave the crowd a lot to cheer about. Unfortunately for Washington, it was the invasion of Dallas fans who were making the noise. At one point, the Cowboys rattled off 21 unanswered, which created enough distance that Washington was unable to overcome.\n\nNo matter what the Redskins tried on defense, the Cowboys had an answer.\n\nA week after he finished with a perfect passer rating, quarterback Dak Prescott threw for 260 yards and three touchdowns \u2014 with only four of his 30 attempts not resulting in a completion.\n\nAgainst the run, the Redskins were no better. Cowboys star Ezekiel Elliott ran for 111 yards on 23 carries \u2014 as a team, Dallas chewed up 213 yards on 34 rushing attempts.\n\nThe Redskins spent the week leading up to the Cowboys game talking about cleaning up Week 1 mistakes like the coverage miscommunication that led to DeSean Jackson\u2019s 51-yard Eagles touchdown in the season opener.\n\nBut defensive calls were a problem again, linebacker Jon Bostic said. The Cowboys were able to pounce on defensive miscues, like when receiver Devin Smith burned cornerback Josh Norman on a post route for a 51-yard score in the second quarter to tie the game at seven.\n\nNorman looked like he was expecting safety help over the top.\n\nAsked about the play, Norman said he didn\u2019t want to throw any of his teammates under the bus.\n\n\u201cI look at that as (taking) it on the chin,\u201d Norman said. \u201cI take everything else on the chin, so why not? I\u2019ve got to hold my head up high and keep going forward.\u201d\n\nIn the locker room, the Redskins remain optimistic.\n\nRunning back Adrian Peterson said the start of seasons aren\u2019t indicative of the way a year can unfold, pointing to Washington\u2019s 6-3 start in 2018 as an example. (The Redskins, in case you forgot, finished 7-9.)\n\nBut Washington\u2019s defensive problems are particularly baffling because there are moments when the Redskins look like a formidable unit.\n\nWashington, for example, forced Prescott into his first interception of the year when defensive tackle Daron Payne applied pressure up the middle, causing the quarterback to scramble and toss an errant throw to receiver Randall Cobb. Prescott\u2019s pass bounced off Cobb\u2019s hands and right to safety Montae Nicholson.\n\nAfter the turnover, Peterson capped off the 38-yard drive by bulldozing his way to the end zone for a 1-yard score and a 7-0 Redskins lead.\n\nBut as the game wore on, the Redskins defense wilted. There were too many long drives and too many mistakes. In the second quarter, the Cowboys strung together drives of 97 and 83 yards.\n\nThe latter included a 42-yard quarterback keeper from Prescott and a pivotal defensive holding call on Jimmy Moreland in the end zone that kept a Dallas drive alive. On the next play, Prescott hit tight end Jason Witten for a touchdown and the Cowboys took a 14-7 lead into halftime.\n\nWashington\u2019s offense has mostly done its job. Quarterback Case Keenum was again solid with 221 yards and through two games, the Redskins are averaging 24 points per game.\n\nBut that\u2019s not good enough with the team\u2019s porous defense.\n\nGruden suggested the coaching staff wasn\u2019t reaching players \u2014 though he stopped short of suggesting changes need to be made.\n\nThe Redskins, who next face the Chicago Bears in a Monday nighter at FedEx, should benefit \u2014 in theory \u2014 from the return of several injured defensive contributors. End Jonathan Allen (knee) and cornerbacks Quinton Dunbar (knee) and Fabian Moreau (ankle) all missed Sunday\u2019s game with injuries.\n\n\u201cFor us, it shows us that we\u2019ve still got a ways to go,\u201d Bostic said. \u201cRegardless of who\u2019s in there or how long they\u2019ve been here, none of that stuff matters. \u2026 It\u2019s various things. You can\u2019t really pinpoint saying it\u2019s one thing.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
