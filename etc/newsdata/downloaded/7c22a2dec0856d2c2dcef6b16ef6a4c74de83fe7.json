(Theodor de Bry/Library of Congress)\n\nThe Lucayan did not know it was Oct. 12, 1492. They did not know that their island, in what would become the Bahamas, had been spotted by Spanish explorers led by a Genoese man named Christopher Columbus. And they did not know that in less than 30 years, their island would be empty from the coming genocide.\n\nAs Columbus and his men approached, the Lucayans greeted them warmly, offering food and water, and \u201cwe understood that they had asked us if we had come from heaven,\u201d he wrote in his journal.\n\nThen he added, \u201cWith 50 men they can all be subjugated and made to do what is required of them.\u201d\n\nSome of them, he noticed, were wearing gold nose rings.\n\n[Christopher Columbus and the potato that changed the world]\n\nColumbus and his crew stayed just long enough to kidnap a few inhabitants, before sailing away to explore other islands filled with indigenous people.\n\nThis year the District of Columbia joins at least five states and dozens of cities and counties in replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day. It\u2019s part of a decades-long reckoning with the sanitized version of the European colonization of the Americas.\n\nIn Hispaniola \u2014 what is now Haiti and the Dominican Republic \u2014 Columbus encountered the Lucayans\u2019 cousins, the Ta\u00edno. (The Lucayan were a branch of the much larger Ta\u00edno, who were part of the Arawak language group.) Historians disagree on how many Ta\u00edno lived on Hispaniola at the time, with estimates ranging from 60,000 to 8 million. One contemporaneous account from Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas claimed there were 3 million. More about las Casas shortly.\n\nThere Columbus built a fort where he left a few dozen of his crew, killed two people, took more hostages and sailed back to Spain. As soon as they hit cooler weather, the Ta\u00edno began to die, according to Howard Zinn in \u201cA People\u2019s History of the United States.\u201d\n\nAfter significantly overselling the prospects for gold to the king and queen of Spain, Columbus returned to Hispaniola with 17 ships and 1,200 men. The men he had left at the fort the year before had all been killed, \u201cafter they had roamed the island in gangs looking for gold, taking women and children as slaves for sex and labor,\u201d Zinn wrote.\n\nColumbus and his crew searched and searched for gold to no avail, so they filled their ships with something else they could sell: people. Of the 500 Ta\u00edno they took \u2014 selected because they were the strongest and healthiest specimens \u2014 200 died on the voyage to Spain. Many more died once they had been sold into slavery.\n\nSo Columbus tried again for gold, but this time he and his men didn\u2019t go looking for it. They ordered all Ta\u00edno people 14 and older to deliver a certain amount of gold dust every three months. If they didn\u2019t, their hands would be cut off.\n\nAt this point, the Ta\u00edno were refusing to grow crops, and those who didn\u2019t bleed to death after their hands were removed began to die of famine and disease. When they fled into the mountains, they were hunted down by dogs. Many killed themselves with cassava poison.\n\nColumbus\u2019s men also continued to sexually abuse Ta\u00edno women and girls. In 1500, Columbus wrote to an acquaintance that \u201cthere are many dealers who go about looking for girls; those from nine to 10 are now in demand.\u201d\n\nAs the population plummeted, they abducted indigenous people from other islands, like the Lucayan, to work the fields and mines of Hispaniola. When the British colonized the Bahamas in the 1600s, the islands had been deserted for more than a century.\n\n\n\nThis engraving by Joos van Winghe and Theodor de Bry depicts the atrocities committed by Spanish explorers on the indigenous people of the Caribbean described by Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas. (Peace Palace Library/Peace Palace Library, The Netherlands)\n\nBartolom\u00e9 de las Casas arrived in Hispaniola in 1502, when he was 18. For decades, he participated in the mistreatment of the Ta\u00edno and the introduction of enslaved Africans, before renouncing it all, becoming a Dominican friar and confessing what he had witnessed in \u201cA Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies.\u201d\n\nIt is worth quoting him at length. This excerpt is very graphic:\n\n\u201cThey [Spanish explorers] forced their way into native settlements, slaughtering everyone they found there, including small children, old men, pregnant women, and even women who had just given birth. They hacked them to pieces, slicing open their bellies with their swords as though they were so many sheep herded into a pen. They even laid wagers on whether they could slice a man in two at a stroke, or cut an individual\u2019s head from his body, or disembowel him with a single blow of their axes. They grabbed suckling infants by the feet and, ripping them from their mothers\u2019 breasts, dashed them headlong against the rocks. Other, laughing and joking all the while, threw them over their shoulders, shouting, \u2018Wriggle, you little perisher.\u2019\n\nWhen las Casas wrote this in 1542, there were only 200 Ta\u00edno left on Hispaniola. Across the Caribbean, he claimed the Spanish were responsible for the deaths of 12 to 15 million indigenous people.\n\nHistorians usually attribute most of the deaths to the spread of diseases for which native people had no immunity, but recently historian Andr\u00e9s Res\u00e9ndez has pushed back against this, arguing that populations were lower than previous estimated, and \u201ca nexus of slavery, overwork and famine killed more Indians in the Caribbean than smallpox, influenza and malaria.\u201d\n\nSoon after Columbus\u2019s death in 1506, Spanish explorers moved onto to other islands, like Puerto Rico and Jamaica, and according to de las Casas, \u201cperpetrated the same outrages and committed the same crimes as before.\u201d\n\nBy 1650, Zinn wrote, reports indicated the Ta\u00edno were extinct.\n\nBut recent scholarship proves that may not have been the case. Researchers compared the DNA from the tooth of a pre-Columbian Lucayan woman found in a cave in the Bahamas to that of contemporary Puerto Ricans, who are generally thought to be an interracial mix of African, European and Native American ancestry. They found that the Native American component in the Puerto Rican samples was closely related to the Lucayan DNA. The results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2018.\n\nJorge Estevez, a Ta\u00edno descendant who assisted the research, told Newsweek: \u201cI wish my grandmother were alive today so that I could confirm to her what she already knew. It shows that the true story is one of assimilation, certainly, but not total extinction.\u201d\n\nThe Ta\u00edno also live on in our language \u2014 barbecue, hammock, canoe, tobacco and hurricane are all derived from Ta\u00edno words.\n\n\n\nA pre-Columbian drawing by the Ta\u00edno in a cave in San Cristobal, Dominican Republic.
