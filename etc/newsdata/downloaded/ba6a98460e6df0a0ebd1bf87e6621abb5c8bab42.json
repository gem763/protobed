Senior aides for a bunch of other campaigns certainly are, judging by their hushed rumor-sharing and -gathering on Wednesday in the enormous lobby of a downtown hotel where multiple candidates are staying here in Houston. Plus, just look at this week\u2019s headlines: \u201cJoe Biden to Argue in Upcoming Debate That \u2018We Need More Than Plans,\u2019\u201d reported CNN, previewing \u201ca potential line of attack\u201d on Warren. \u201cBiden Aims to Use Debate to Question Warren\u2019s Corporate Work,\u201d wrote Bloomberg.\n\nAnd it would make some intuitive sense: Biden remains the front-runner, Warren is on the rise, and they do have a long, complicated history together, starting with their decades-old Capitol Hill clashes over bankruptcy law, swerving into potential d\u00e9tente when Biden wanted Warren as his running mate if he ran in 2016, and leading up to the last few weeks of escalating hype from commentators eager to see them, and their contrasting visions, onstage together for the first time.\n\nBut this latest news and commentary cycle is setting expectations unrealistically high for an orchestrated one-on-one clash \u2014 the kind we saw between Biden and Kamala Harris in June. It\u2019s a neat lesson in how a 2020 narrative takes shape.\n\nEarlier this week, members of Biden\u2019s team spoke with beat reporters who\u2019d inquired about his debate posture, and they offered mostly innocuous talking points, primarily about how Biden intends to run his own race and stick to his own message. But, buried in there, they did include some lines that could point to a few debate-night contrasts. For one, they noted that Biden will (again) likely say that we need more than plans \u2014 a line of his that has always, and understandably, been read as a shot at Warren, since having specific policy plans is key to her campaign, messaging, and political identity. They also said more expensive plans are not necessarily more progressive ones \u2014 another possible Warren-aimed line of argument that\u2019s in keeping with Biden\u2019s central messaging. And they mentioned that candidates should be transparent about their work before taking office \u2014 a final possible knock on Warren, given questions she\u2019s faced about her pre-politics corporate legal work.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Warren\u2019s rise has unsettled members of Biden\u2019s inner circle, and that both campaigns can envision a world where they eventually face off directly in the race. But as eager as Biden allies are to take Warren on at some point, more were doubly eager to \u201cpump the brakes,\u201d in the words of one adviser, once the Biden-to-attack-Warren narrative dug in further than ever Tuesday.\n\nWhy? Well, for one, not all of the potential lines of attack that have been singled out are necessarily Warren-specific, especially the ones Biden\u2019s already been saying on the campaign trail. His knocks on the expense of \u201cprogressive\u201d plans could be read just as easily as a hit on Bernie Sanders, who remains a top-tier candidate no matter how you slice the numbers, and his points about transparency in pre-Washington careers could also be aimed at Harris, whose prosecutorial record has been a focus of Biden\u2019s in the past.\n\nBut, more importantly, there\u2019s zero doubt that the contrast of visions between Biden and Warren will already play out on the stage, no matter what; their messages are so different that the distance between them will be clear the second they open their mouths. No preplanned fireworks \u2014 say, surprise invocations of 1981 op-eds or callouts of 1970s-era busing positions \u2014 needed. Both sides are also expecting the ABC News moderators to push them up against each other, especially after the network\u2019s political newsletter on Wednesday interpreted Warren saying \u201cI\u2019m someone who will fight for your family, I\u2019m not here to fight for the rich and the powerful\u201d as evidence that she was targeting Biden (headline: \u201cWarren Puts Biden on Warning on Eve of Next Debate\u201d).\n\nMeanwhile, neither Biden nor Warren has an obvious long-term political incentive to spring a pre-organized, oppo-research-backed attack on the other. Such a maneuver would be a significant strategic break for Biden, who\u2019s run the traditional front-runner playbook and only called out opponents by name when hit first (like with Cory Booker at the last debate). The same goes for Warren, who\u2019s focused primarily on her own story while introducing herself to Democratic voters as a vision-focused candidate, and who has little reason to want the race to turn into a one-on-one matchup based on personal records so long before Iowa votes.\n\nAs the hype has grown in recent days \u2014 a big red banner atop CNN\u2019s website announced \u201cBiden and Warren finally go head-to-head\u201d on Thursday morning \u2014 Warren has consistently demurred when asked if she will use the debate to attack Biden. \u201cI\u2019m not here to criticize any other Democrat, or anyone else\u2019s campaign,\u201d she said over the weekend in New Hampshire when asked about him. And Biden allies\u2019 frustration has mounted with the growing expectation that the former VP will be the aggressor.\n\nThat line of analysis, one of his advisers groused to me, is a \u201cdisservice to voters and the conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite this being the most complex Democratic field in generations \u2014 if not ever \u2014 the press and political watchers on Twitter keep oversimplifying the race, spending more resources on speculative hot takes and predictions \u2014 glaring evidence that the profound lessons of 2016 remain unlearned \u2014 or reducing coverage of this whole cycle to either hyping any perceived miscue by Biden or depicting the primary as though it\u2019s only about Biden versus one other candidate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw this kind of exaggeration surrounding one other candidate take hold after the first debate, with Kamala Harris, and then for the past several weeks with Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nThe truth is that a candidate may, after all, try to take inspiration from Harris\u2019s surprise attack on Biden, which remains the most memorable moment from the first eight-plus hours of debates, and which temporarily boosted Harris in the race. But it probably won\u2019t be Biden or Warren \u2014 who will likely be locked in their own conversation about their competing visions of the world. It likely won\u2019t be Sanders, or even Harris either. For most of the field, the whole game now is getting enough attention to raise enough money to stay alive. There\u2019s little doubt that the contours of Thursday\u2019s debate will already be shaped by the ideological gulf between Biden and Warren. For an attack to really break through, it will have to come from somewhere unexpected.", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s team wants to \u201cpump the brakes\u201d on the hype around his first debate matchup with Elizabeth Warren.
