They are docile creatures \u2013 almost domesticated.\n\nPardon me while I dip a nugget into the Chick-fil-A sauce. Sumptuous, indeed.\n\nKatie Batza, an associate professor of women and gender studies, told the Kansas City Star that their protest is a serious matter.\n\nHundreds \u201care very upset about this,\u201d she alleged. \u201cMy sense is that there will be hundreds who will boycott or protest.\u201d\n\nNo doubt feathers have been ruffled.\n\nThe faculty council\u2019s beef with the Atlanta-based company can be traced back to 2012 when the company\u2019s chief executive officer told a reporter that he believed in the biblical definition of marriage.\n\nThey are also upset because Chick-fil-A has donated to a number of Christian charities like the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Salvation Army.\n\nOh wow, that macaroni and cheese is really good.\n\n\u201cWhile many Christians are supportive of the LGBTQ community and many are members themselves, the culture of Chick-fil-A fosters hate and discrimination on multiple levels,\u201d the faculty wrote.\n\nThe truth is I\u2019ve fielded a number of telephone calls on my nationally-syndicated radio show from LGBT listeners who love Chick-fil-A.\n\nAnd let me drop another truth bomb as I drink my Chick-fil-A sweet tea. The company has never been accused of discriminating against the LGBT community.\n\nKU\u2019s College Republicans have launched a petition to defend the nation\u2019s most popular fast food chain. And they plan to serve Chick-fil-A at their first meeting of the semester.\n\nThe Star reports that opponents may have to wait until 2024, when the restaurant\u2019s contract is up for renewal.\n\nMeantime, maybe the Sexuality & Gender Diversity Faculty and Staff Council might be more comfortable feasting on KFC\u2019s new plant-based poultry sandwich?", "description": "Nothing triggers a leftist faster than a Chick-fil-A sandwich.That\u2019s actually .09/02/2019 3:23:17AM EST.", "authors": ["Todd Starnes", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/239/b88c5a10-e6ef-4081-a497-71618c0acbef.png"}
