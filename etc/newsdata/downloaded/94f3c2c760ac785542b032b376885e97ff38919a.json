Democrats are investigating President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine and exploring whether he abused his office by seeking dirt from a foreign country on former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender for the 2020 White House nomination and Trump's political rival.\n\nThat work will intensify when Congress gets back. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., has said she wants the committees to work \"expeditiously\" as Democrats gather evidence and prepare to make a final decision on whether to vote to impeach the president.\n\nThe impeachment probe was sparked by a whistleblower who revealed that Trump asked Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on a July telephone call to investigate Biden's family and Ukraine's role of in the 2016 election that put Trump in office. The calls to investigate Joe Biden and son Hunter have come without evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden, in either country.\n\nTrump has defended his conduct as \"perfect\" and said he will refuse to comply with the inquiry.\n\n___\n\nFLURRY OF SUBPOENAS AND DEPOSITIONS\n\nDespite Trump's assertions that he won't cooperate, some members of his administration are participating anyway.\n\nStaff and lawmakers from the House Intelligence Committee, the House Oversight and Reform Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have called in several State Department witnesses.\n\nThey have already heard from two: Kurt Volker, a former envoy to Ukraine, and Marie Yovanovitch , a former ambassador to Ukraine. Fiona Hill, a former White House adviser who focused on Russia, is expected to appear in private on Monday, with plans for Gordon Sondland , the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, to follow on Thursday. Sondland didn't show up for a scheduled deposition last week after the State Department directed him not to come, but his lawyer said he would comply with a subpoena issued by the committees afterward.\n\nDemocrats want to ask Sondland about text messages provided by Volker that show the two of them acting as intermediaries as Trump urged Ukraine to start the investigations.\n\nThe committees are also seeking closed-door depositions with George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state in the European and Eurasian Bureau, and Ulrich Brechbuhl, a State Department counselor.\n\nThe panels have subpoenaed or requested documents from the White House, the Defense Department, the White House Office of Management and Budget, Vice President Mike Pence, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and two Giuliani associates. The deadlines for most of those requests are this coming week.\n\n___\n\nTHE WHISTLEBLOWER\n\nThe chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., suggested Sunday that the committee may not need to hear from the whistleblower after weeks of negotiations to obtain the person's testimony. The talks have centered on how to protect the whistleblower, who is publicly unknown, and prevent retaliation, given that Trump has said he wants to know the person's identity. Congressional aides have even suggested somehow disguising the whistleblower so that person's identity wouldn't be revealed.\n\nSchiff said \"it may not be necessary\" to take steps that could risk disclosing the person's identity to find out more about the July telephone call. The White House released a rough transcript of the call last month.\n\n\"Given that we already have the call record, we don't need the whistleblower, who wasn't on the call, to tell us what took place during the call,\" Schiff said on CBS' \"Face the Nation. \"We have the best evidence of that.\"\n\n___\n\nDEMOCRATS STICK TO THEIR STRATEGY\n\nPelosi has been unflappable while Republicans have criticized her for declining to hold a vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry. The Constitution doesn't require one, but the House held such votes during the impeachment investigations of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\nIn a conference call with the Democratic caucus on Friday, the issue didn't even come up, according to a person familiar with that private call who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss it.", "description": "Congress is returning from a two-week recess on Tuesday, but some lawmakers barely left Washington.
