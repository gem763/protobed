This little peak is an icon in Sweden,\u201d said Ninis Rosqvist, a geography professor at Stockholm University. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a surprise. When the temperature rises, ice melts, but this is something that really hits home for a lot of people,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the last 50 years, the southern peak has lost 24 meters of its roughly 60 meters of ice cap. It now stands at 2,095.6 meters compared with the 2,096.8 meters of the northern peak.\n\nSweden has experienced unusually hot summers in the last 10 years and 2018 was the warmest ever on record.\n\nLast month Iceland unveiled a plaque to its Okjokull ice sheet, the first of the country\u2019s hundreds of glaciers to melt away due to climate change.
