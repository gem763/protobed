After discovering the home in 1998 while visiting a client on the same street, Mr Gertos occupied it for the next 19 years before making an application in 2017 to claim squatter\u2019s rights with the NSW Registrar-General.\n\nRELATED:\n\nGreenwich hoarder home where mummified body found for sale\n\n\n\nAbandoned house trashed by termites turns into real estate gold\n\n\n\nThe bizarre case ended up in court after the family of Henry Thompson Downie, a deceased man who had bought the property in 1927, tried to challenge the ownership. The NSW Supreme Court ruled that Mr Gertos had lawful possession as he was \u201copen and peaceful\u201d about it, as required squatter\u2019s right laws.\n\nMr Gertos, who was unable to be contacted, had previously told the court he gained access to the derelict house through a back door that had been \u201changing off its hinges\u201d.\n\nThe next day he had the locks changed and paid a builder $35,000 to renovate the home before renting it out.\n\nCoreLogic records reveal that it was last listed for rent in February with a $550 per week asking price \u2013 $140 less than the average rental price for the area.\n\nMr Gertos spent $108,000 on renovations in 2014 to give the home a new kitchen with gas cooking and stainless European appliances, as well as a bathroom.\n\nThe listing ad describes the home as a \u201cfusion of historical charm\u201d with renovated interiors on a \u201ctree-lined street\u201d. Set on 498sqm, the home has an \u201centertainer\u2019s backyard\u201d and backs onto parks and the Canterbury Park Racecourse.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE LATEST NSW REAL ESTATE NEWSLETTER", "description": "A property developer who got his hands on an inner west house for absolutely nothing in a bizarre squatter\u2019s rights case is now set to pocket over $1 million after putting it up for sale.", "authors": ["Matt Bell"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/29154938/capi_193ebe317e76b38d9ed88ecb2004b9b5_43f2659948424645c64376ee0fa3b83e.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
