This marks the first time Apple has introduced a \u2018serious\u2019 headphone since 2008\u2019s Apple In-Ear headphones.\n\nBy serious, I mean a headphone that actually prioritizes sound quality. While the AirPods are decent for what they are, they won\u2019t win any prizes for their fidelity. It\u2019s difficult to make an earbud with a proper bass balance unless you create a seal with the ear canal. The AirPods Pro do just that, as Apple\u2019s first headphones to use ear tips since the aforementioned 2008 model.\n\nBecause the headphones now create a proper seal, they will presumably block out more sound by default. On top of this, Apple has added active noise canceling, which uses two microphones to capture and mitigate background noise. The company says the microphones \u201ccontinuously adapt the sound signal about 200 times per second.\n\nBut many AirPods users liked them precisely because they didn\u2019t require a seal. It means a more comfortable fit for those with persnickety ear canals, and it means you have better awareness of the outside world. Apple claims it has you covered. The AirPods Pro introduce a \u2018pressure-equalizing vent system\u2019 that purportedly minimizes discomfort sometimes seen in other in-ear designs. The company also includes a \u2018transparency\u2019 mode, which you might\u2019ve heard called an \u2018ambient\u2019 or \u2018awareness\u2019 mode on other products.\n\nThis typically uses the microphones to augment the sound you hear rather than cancel it out, but Apple says it uses its pressure-equalizing system to leave just the right amount of noise-cancelling active to ensure natural sounding voices. It\u2019s a handy feature to have should you want to be aware of your surroundings or want to be able to listen to the outside world while still getting notifications and the like. You\u2019ll be able to activate it right from the earbuds with a tap.\n\nOn the sound quality front, Apple claims \u2018consistent, rich bass down to 20 Hz.\u2019 This is not particularly remarkable, as that\u2019s something literally every half-decent earbud does. But that doesn\u2019t matter, because the AirPods Pro are for people who loved or wanted AirPods, but wished they came with better sound. The keyword here is \u2018consistent,\u2019 as creating a seal with your ear allows for a far more stable acoustic environment than an open design.\n\nThe earbuds feature a custom high-excursion, low distortion dynamic driver, which seems to be a new design. Moreover, Apple says the AirPods Pro include \u2018Adaptive EQ,\u2019 which automatically modifies low and mid frequencies to the shape of your ear.\n\nAs someone who prioritizes sound quality in my earbuds, this is the first time I\u2019ve ever had the slightest interest in AirPods. For those who already loved the reliability and ease of use of AirPods, but wanted better sound quality, it might be a dream come true. Sound quality was always the main advantage competitors had over the AirPods. If the AirPods Pro live up to their promise, everyone else will have to step their game up.\n\nThe AirPods Pro will be available to order online for $249 from October 30th, and will be available in stores \u201cbeginning later this week.\u201d\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FApple-AirPods-Pro.jpg&signature=820034038eb59655355cc7dbfc8aba15", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
