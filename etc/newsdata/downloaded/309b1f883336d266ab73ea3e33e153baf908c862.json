That's when the teenager fled and was recovered unharmed.\n\nAuthorities later arrested Dreyfuss and charged him on suspicion of kidnapping, sending harmful matter to a minor and communication with a minor for specific offences.\n\nThe teenager's identity was not released.\n\nUpon meeting the teenager, Dreyfuss allegedly lured her into his car and drove off with her against her will, the department says in a report obtained by DailyMail.com\n\nAmateur pedophile stings, similar to the operations that were featured on the now cancelled NBC program, 'To Catch a Predator,' while sometimes successful have been discouraged by law enforcement for exactly the kinds of problems that crept up before Dreyfuss' arrest.\n\n'The Sheriff's Department strongly discourages the public from setting up meetings or contacting anyone for the purpose of catching an individual who is committing a crime,' the San Diego Sheriff's Department said in reference to the teenager's involvement in luring Dreyfuss.\n\nIn June, a San Francisco Bay Area college student used Snapchat's gender switch filter to pose as a 16-year-old girl online and take down a 40-year-old police officer allegedly looking for underage sex on Tinder.\n\nEthan, 20, who did not reveal his last name for fear of retaliation, pretended to be 'Esther' on the dating app, where he caught the eye of San Mateo cop Robert Davies.\n\n'Are you down to have some fun tonight?' the man asked.\n\n'I decided to take advantage of it,' Ethan told NBC Bay Area.\n\nHe said he was motivated to catch possible pedophiles because a female friend had told him she had been molested as a child.\n\n'I was just looking to get someone\u2026 He just happened to be a cop,' Ethan said.\n\nAfter moving the conversation to another app, the student told Davies he was 16-years-old.\n\nHis age did not bother the cop, according to the San Jose Police Department.\n\n'We started texting on there, and it got a lot more explicit,' Ethan said.\n\nThe student then chatted with Davies for around 12 hours.\n\n'Through the messages, on purpose I would just get these little bits of information about him so it would be easier to track him down,' Ethan told NBC.\n\nEthan took screenshots of the explicit conversation and showed the messages to Crime Stoppers.\n\nAfter the tip off, San Jose detectives began investigating Davies in May.\n\nOfficers from San Jose Police's Internet Crimes Against Children arrested Davies on June 6.\n\nHe was booked into Santa Clara County Jail for contacting a minor to commit a felony.\n\n'Whether or not the person is 16 is irrelevant, if the suspect believes it's a 16-year-old on the other end, the suspect should have terminated that conversation - specifically when it talks about engaging in sexual activity,' Sgt. Enrique Garcia told KTVU.\n\nEven though Ethan's efforts were successful, authorities have continued discouraging amateurs from taking the law into their own hands.\n\n'These types of situations can be extremely dangerous and should be handled by your local law enforcement agency,' said the San Diego Sheriff's Department in reference to the Dreyfuss case.\n\n'The Sheriff's Department takes all crimes against our children extremely serious and is committed to keeping our children and communities safe. If you have information involving a crime, please report it to your local law enforcement agency,' the department added.\n\nDreyfuss was released from the San Diego Detention Center on a $175 bond.", "description": "A 17-year-old girl among friends doing an amateur pedophile sting was lured by the man they were trying to catch into his car and almost kidnapped before she texted for help and cops came/", "authors": ["Ralph R.
