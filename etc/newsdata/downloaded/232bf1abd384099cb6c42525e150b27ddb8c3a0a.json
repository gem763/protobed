Most people hate black liquorice, and so when they receive some in their trick-or-treat bags, or when they find black jelly beans amongst their Easter loot, they can pass it along to their grandpas and other weirdos who actually like the stuff. But these weirdos should be careful.\n\nFull disclosure, I am one of the weirdos. I always hated black liquorice, until one day I didn\u2019t. If I buy a bag of black liquorice, I have to pace myself\u2014just a few pieces a day\u2014the way some people do with chocolate. Invite me to your Halloween parties. I\u2019ll take your liquorices and you can have my Hershey bars.\n\nBut eating large amounts of liquorice has to have some downside, and U.S. health authority the FDA has confirmed: enough glycyrrhizin (its tasty component) can reduce potassium levels in the body, which occasionally results in \u201cabnormal heart rhythms, as well as high blood pressure, edema (swelling), lethargy and congestive heart failure.\u201d The risk seems to only be in people over 40.\n\nHow much liquorice is too much?\n\nFirst, check if you\u2019re actually eating real liquorice. If your candy is flavoured with anise oil, you\u2019re in the clear. If it includes actual liquorice root (fun fact: liquorice is a plant), keep reading.\n\nThe UK\u2019s National Health Service writes that eating \u201cmore than 57g of black liquorice a day for at least 2 weeks could lead to potentially serious health problems.\u201d\n\nSo if you are the black liquorice eater in your family, and you are over 40, consider rationing your haul so you don\u2019t eat tons of it for weeks straight. Even though you really want to.", "description": "There is a balance in the universe.
