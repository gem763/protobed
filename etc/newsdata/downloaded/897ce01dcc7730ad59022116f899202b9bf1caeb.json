He's going to be playing tomorrow and he's going to be focusing on the game. He's been in a good space as a team player and also the players around him in the squad are in a good space.\"\n\nEtzebeth, who has signed to play for Top 14 giants Toulon after the World Cup, was interviewed by Human Rights Commission officials before flying out with the South African squad.\n\nThe commission said it would meet the complainant on Thursday to take further instructions.\n\n\"We will definitely ask for monetary compensation. We will ask for a public apology. We will ask for criminal prosecution of Mr Etzebeth. We will ask for community service and other forms of relief,\" Buang Jones, acting head of legal serves at SAHRC, told AFP.\n\nThe commission will also hold a public meeting on Thursday in the town. \"The community are demanding justice,\" said Jones.\n\nHe also said the commission will approach the country's police service to ask it to look into claims of bias against a police officer who initially investigated the matter.\n\nKick-off is at 11:45 (SA time) on Friday.\n\nTeams:\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Willie le Roux, 14 Cheslin Kolbe, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Tendai Mtawarira\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, 22 Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn\n\nItaly\n\n15 Matteo Minozzi, 14 Tommaso Benvenuti, 13 Luca Morisi, 12 Jayden Hayward, 11 Michele Campagnaro, 10 Tommaso Allan, 9 Tito Tebaldi, 8 Sergio Parisse (captain), 7 Jake Polledri, 6 Braam Steyn, 5 Dean Budd, 4 David Sisi, 3 Simone Ferrari, 2 Luca Bigi, 1 Andrea Lovotti\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Federico Zani, 17 Nicola Quaglio, 18 Marco Riccioni, 19 Alessandro Zanni, 20 Federico Ruzza, 21 Sebastian Negri, 22 Callum Braley, 23 Carlo Canna", "description": "South Africa said star lock Eben Etzebeth remains fully focused on Friday's do-or-die Rugby World Cup match with Italy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8949/75456ea815bf4e26aeeca38352d651cc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
