Tokyo ended the morning 0.3 percent higher and Seoul was up 0.4 percent.\n\nSydney, Taipei, Jakarta and Manila all put on 0.1 percent.\n\n\u2013 Eyes on Fed meeting \u2013\n\nHowever, while the agreement would be a big positive for markets, analysts point out that it is still the first part of a wider deal that could take some time to complete.\n\nAnd Ray Attrill at National Australia Bank said: \u201cWhat\u2019s not yet clear yet is if both sides have agreed that even if the planned December 15 tariff increases won\u2019t go ahead if phase one is agreed, whether there will be any wind back of the higher tariffs imposed on September 1.\u201d\n\nThat issue, he said, was \u201csomething China was said to be demanding toward the end of last week but we doubt the US is ready to concede on\u201d.\n\nStill, the mood on trading floors is positive and expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its latest policy meeting this week were also providing support.\n\nSterling edged down with focus on Westminster, where MPs will vote later in the day on whether to grant Boris Johnson a December 12 general election, which he has called for to break the Brexit deadlock.\n\nWith lawmakers refusing to pass his divorce deal before Thursday\u2019s deadline, the prime minister wants a snap poll he hopes will give him a majority of MPs who will push it through parliament.\n\nAlso Monday, EU leaders will make a decision on whether to extend the deadline to the end of January and while expectations are for Britain to leave with a deal, Attrill added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how this renewed level of uncertainty can be anything other than negative for Sterling given the size of recent gains.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Key figures around 0230 GMT \u2013\n\nTokyo \u2013 Nikkei 225: UP 0.3 percent at 22,861.59 (break)\n\nHong Kong \u2013 Hang Seng: UP 0.7 percent at 26,851.96\n\nShanghai \u2013 Composite: UP 0.3 percent at 2,963.80\n\nPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2819 from $1.2823 at 2030 GMT on Friday\n\nEuro/pound: UP at 86.42 pence from 86.39 pence\n\nDollar/yen: UP at 108.75 yen from 108.67 yen\n\nEuro/dollar: DOWN at $1.1077 from $1.1079\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN eight cents at $56.58 per barrel\n\nBrent North Sea crude: DOWN six cents at $61.96 per barrel\n\nNew York \u2013 Dow: UP 0.6 percent at 26,958.06 (close)\n\nLondon \u2013 FTSE 100: DOWN 0.1 percent at 7,324.47 (close)", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Asian markets rallied Monday after China and the US said they were close to agreeing a mini trade deal, but the pound extended", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/d8ce33_donald-trump-is-hoping-get-trade-deal-finalised-he-meets-chinese-counterpart-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
