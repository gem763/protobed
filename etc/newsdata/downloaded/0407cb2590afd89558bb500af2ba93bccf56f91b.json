In 2012, for example, a Chinese boycott of Japanese cars broke out in response to a fight between the two countries over territorial claims in the East China Sea. Japanese car companies\u2019 market share in China plunged 12 percent in a month. But then sales came back by the end of the year. \u201cChinese consumer boycotts have historically been short-lived and relatively painless,\u201d Minter wrote \u2014 further noting that the NBA\u2019s popularity in China dwarfs that of any particular car brand.\n\nAccording to CNBC, there\u2019s a growing sense within the NBA that ultimately that popularity will win out. \u201cSome diplomacy will be necessary,\u201d but \u201cthey are going to want the NBA back,\u201d one executive said.\n\nThus far, the fear has been that those hundreds of millions of Chinese fans were an advantage China could hold over the NBA. Eventually, the latter would throw American values overboard in order to keep the money rolling in.\n\nBut that\u2019s a sword that cuts both ways: Now that China has let the proverbial camel\u2019s nose of capitalist consumerism into the tent, the NBA can hold those fans and their dissatisfaction over the Chinese government as well. And American basketball may well discover its leverage is the greater.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jeff Spross", "Theweek.Com Articles Nba-Win-Standoff-China"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
