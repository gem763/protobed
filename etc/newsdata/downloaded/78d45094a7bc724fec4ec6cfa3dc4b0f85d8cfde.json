Recently, Logitech bought Streamlabs, a streaming software company used by almost half of all streamers on platforms like Twitch and YouTube.\n\nNilay and Bracken talk about how acquiring this software company makes sense for Logitech, its own hardware that works with Streamlabs, and what it\u2019s like making hardware for big companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google.\n\nNote: We called up Bracken a week after we recorded our initial interview to follow up on news of Logitech buying Streamlabs. We edited that part in around 10 minutes into the show, so the audio changes slightly for a few minutes. Apologies for that, but below is a lightly edited excerpt of that part of the conversation.\n\nNilay Patel: So you just bought a company called Streamlabs. I think it\u2019s [for] $89 million. It\u2019s a big investment. What attracts you to Streamlabs?\n\nBracken Darrell: Well, you know we love this world of the democratization of content creation. There was a period when I was growing up when NBC and Disney and all these other big companies beam things through your living room right into your eyes. They control the content. You were the viewer. Today, content is created by billions of people and it\u2019s getting bigger and bigger all the time. And so this is an area that we think with Blue microphones (like the one sitting in front of me), our webcams (like the one sitting in front of me), our keyboards and our mice \u2014 we belong in this space. We\u2019ve been pulled into the space by people who are creating that content. And now we\u2019re going one step further and Streamlabs was really the leading player in enabling especially gamers who wanted to stream to make money doing it or at least have fun doing it. And so it\u2019s a great fit for what we\u2019re up to.\n\nSo that really connects right to a platform like Twitch. You\u2019ve got the setup, you\u2019ve got all the hardware, you\u2019ve got the gaming PC, you\u2019ve got the microphone, the headset, the camera, now you\u2019ve got the software solution. The next piece of it is obviously there\u2019s Twitch, which is owned by Amazon. I doubt they will sell it to you, like you can\u2019t integrate into that part of the stack. How are you thinking about the future of you owning this part of the stack, but that the distribution side seems very different.\n\nThe answer is to us, this may feel like a leap to you, but it feels really the same to us. You know, our mice for example connect to iOS, they connect to the Microsoft operating system, they connect to the Google Android operating system. So we\u2019ve always been in this business of really supporting these large players and supporting their platforms and really trying to enable their platforms to do more. So we looked at Streamlabs and we thought, \u201cGosh, this is another great example of that.\u201d They\u2019re basically 45 percent of the people who are going onto Twitch. And the primary way Twitch makes money is through advertising. And what they want is they want more people creating content that people come to watch on there. So what they\u2019re basically doing is creating something that\u2019s supporting the platform of Twitch. And of course, they can also support all the other platforms including YouTube. We really like that space. We feel like it\u2019s kind of comfortably at home for us although it\u2019s not hardware. It\u2019s comfortable at home for us in terms of really supporting multiple platforms. And it really works.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this ecosystem of hardware that Logitech makes. Now you\u2019ve got a software product that\u2019s important to a lot of them. This feels like this could be an integrated offering. Could you sell it as a kit? Is that stuff going to get more integrated? Are you going to get more out of the Blue microphone if you run Streamlabs? Are you getting more out of the gaming peripherals if you use one of your headsets? Do you see that kind of value building out of having it all?\n\nWell, you know, it\u2019s possible, but I think the more likely path for us is we want Streamlabs to be successful in its own right. And so to be successful in its own right, it needs to work really well with everything. Whether it\u2019s a competitor to us in our microphone business or headphone business, whatever brands you believe in, you love, you feel like you\u2019re part of, we want you to really come into Streamlabs and have an amazing experience, so I don\u2019t want to disobey it. I would never want to disadvantage some other brand\u2019s product portfolio. But if there are things we could do that would make the experience better, we\u2019ll certainly try to go after them, but I hope that if we do that, we\u2019ll also try to make them better for everything.\n\nAnd then the other kind of big piece of it is you\u2019re not attached to every PC in the world, so you could still grow. But the overall PC market is changing a lot. Microsoft just announced a bunch of new PCs, one of which runs Android. The other one runs an ARM processor. The shape of PCs is obviously changing. Are you saying there\u2019s enough people streaming games on a PC that want this setup, that want the Twitch experience, that you can accelerate into that even as the broader PC market is changing?\n\nYou know, we\u2019ve been in this broader PC market changing since 2008. It went from the PC market grew and grew and grew and grew and then it suddenly went flat, and then it started to decline. And then iPads were suddenly going to be huge and then that kind of slowed down, and then those all go mobile. And then that sort of is happening, but it doesn\u2019t seem to interact. And then the PC will stabilize and it\u2019s kind of growing again.\n\nOur view of the world is, you know, we\u2019ve got lots of things to do for people who want to interact with things that are sitting in the cloud. Most of what we\u2019re talking about is actually not sitting on a PC or on someone\u2019s phone, it\u2019s actually happening at the cloud. It\u2019s somewhere in servers where millions of people can access, it can be updated all the time, and there\u2019s lots of capacity and lots of new things to do. So our general view of the world is all the hardware including what is a PC, will keep changing just like they\u2019ve been changing since 1976 or \u201875.\n\nWhat we\u2019re going to do is try to enable and be a cloud peripherals company, whether it\u2019s hardware \u2014 or in the case of Streamlabs, a service or software \u2014 that enables you to have a great experience and I think that will just always be changing. But we\u2019ll have lots of opportunities underneath that.\n\nSo walk me through some mechanics of an acquisition like Streamlabs. How did it come together?\n\nWell, we\u2019ve worked with everybody who does things like Streamlabs does and so we\u2019ve kind of been working with those companies for the last few years. We worked a lot directly with Streamlabs. We really like the team. We love the two founders that we got to know. We thought they were just super smart, great people and we were impressed by what they\u2019ve been able to do.\n\nAnd so as we got to know them, we\u2019re always looking at things we could be doing beyond the categories we\u2019re in. It generated a discussion that started between me and Ujesh Desai who runs gaming [at Logitech]. And then I brought in the head of M&A. It makes it sound like a really big company, our M&A department is three people. And so it started this discussion with us, and then we said, \u201cCould this work?\u201d And then we talked to Ali [Moiz] about it and he said, \u201cYou know, we don\u2019t really want to sell, but if we did want to sell to anybody, it would be to someone like you \u2014 where you really leave us alone to be our own business inside a business, where you can clear the decks and enable us not to have to raise more money all the time and maybe give us advantages we couldn\u2019t have another way.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s really how it went down. And then you get into the discussion around how much do you pay and all that stuff. And that\u2019s always the steps that naturally M&A goes through. But I\u2019d say that was it. And it started with culturally, \u201cDoes this look like a pretty good fit?\u201d\n\nHow many folks do they have?\n\nThey have about 90 people there. They\u2019re in both San Francisco and Vancouver.\n\nAnd they\u2019re going to stay put in their offices?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nFrom a consumer\u2019s perspective, what changes should you see as short, medium, and long term?\n\nWell, I hope you don\u2019t see anything short term because we think what they\u2019re doing is great. They\u2019ve got a really cool road map that we believe in, and we\u2019re going to support it financially and with any expertise we could bring to the table.\n\nFor medium and long term, I think it remains to be seen. You know they\u2019re a startup that is growing rapidly and pivoting and moving in a couple of different directions. So I think you will naturally see Streamlabs do more things, but I wouldn\u2019t relate that directly to us. I think we\u2019re about really trying to be part of this ecosystem of making the gaming and the streaming experience better and better, and available to more and more people in a super easy way.\n\nSo I don\u2019t have anything specific to say except that I think they were doing great stuff and I hope we\u2019ll do a lot of great stuff together in the future.\n\nYou mentioned supporting the road map financially. Often the larger company comes by and buys the startup and says, \u201cWe\u2019re just going to fund your road map, we\u2019re just going to go for it. You can go a lot faster than you were before.\u201d Was that one of the promises you made or you think they are operating at the right speed?\n\nActually, they were really well funded. I mean, I said it, not you. But the thing was they had a whole bunch of cash sitting there in their bank waiting for them to do what they needed to do.\n\n[Laughs]\n\nSo they really didn\u2019t need us. I mean they really did it because they said, \u201cYou know what, we\u2019re thinking long term and we like the way you guys are thinking. And you\u2019re really interested in enabling streamers to at least have a lot of fun and for it to be easy and maybe to make money and make a living doing it.\u201d So we both had a very similar point of view on this.\n\nI think that was probably more important than the funding of the road map. But I do think when you stretch it out longer, if you\u2019re in a startup that does need money, certainly we want to make sure that they\u2019re well funded, and especially people running the business aren\u2019t out there trying to raise money all the time.\n\nI have met with probably thousands and thousands of founders, and it just breaks my heart most of the time when I realized that these founders have this huge passion for their business \u2014 like in their case, streaming or broadcasting. And then you realize, actually, they\u2019re spending 60 percent of their time talking to venture capitalists and angels and trying to sell their story, and 20 percent of their time really doing what they love. And the other 20 percent is administrating the business in ways that maybe we can help. So hopefully this will get them to 80 or 100 percent of the time doing what they\u2019re really excited about and love.\n\nWith a software business, you don\u2019t have inventory on a shelf. This is your first software business. It\u2019s an expansion for you \u2014 maybe not conceptually \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly an expansion, a different ecosystem and different economy. How are you thinking about, \u201cOkay, we can change the way we operate now that we\u2019re shipping software not hardware\u201d?\n\nWell, the most important thing that we need to be doing is learning because Ali and his brother, these two guys have a lot more to teach us than we have to teach them. So we\u2019re going into this with our eyes wide open trying to make sure we learn. I keep looking on the shelf side to see Streamlabs and it\u2019s not there.\n\nWe\u2019re here to learn and they\u2019ve got a lot to teach us. And we\u2019re going to look more and more like this across all sorts of business. We have launched software-only products, you know, Logitech capture, which is an editing software for things like what we\u2019re doing right now: video creation and content creation. So we\u2019re increasingly getting into that space and I think we\u2019ve got a lot to learn from them, and no inventory to carry, which we like.\n\nIs there more software in your future?\n\nYeah, I don\u2019t know the exact numbers, but we\u2019re probably hiring software engineers two to one over hardware engineers now. We still love hardware, but we\u2019re doing a lot of software and increasingly, we\u2019ll be doing services. So yeah, there\u2019s a lot more software in our future.\n\nBut like consumer software products like Streamlabs, not software to support the hardware?\n\nYes, exactly. Not just firmware, I mean real software. And in our B2B business, we\u2019re in the video conferencing equipment business there, but we\u2019re doing a lot of software there, too. We\u2019re writing software now where an IT department can actually track all the devices in all the rooms that they have and kind of know what usage looks like. And we\u2019ve got AI built into those, that\u2019s somewhere between firmware and traditional software. We\u2019re doing more and more, and you\u2019ll see a lot more software from us in our future over the next decade.", "description": "Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks to current CEO of Logitech Bracken Darrell.", "authors": ["Andrew Marino", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1F1yzWdjvYkUtTNi2T80y6lIA_U=/0x60:1920x1065/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19236345/logi_streamlabs_hero.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
