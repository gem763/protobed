Barcelona now leads Madrid by one point.\n\nBarcelona enjoyed its best away match of the season.\n\nGriezmann put Barcelona ahead in the 13th minute when Clement Lenglet met his run behind Eibar's high defensive line with a long ball that left him alone to beat goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic.\n\nDmitrovic denied Messi before halftime, but couldn't do it again in the 58th after a passing combination by Su\u00e1rez and Griezmann set up Barcelona's all-time scorer in the area.\n\nThe three combined again in the 66th when Griezmann launched Messi with a through ball. Messi then slid the ball over for Su\u00e1rez to finish off on the break.\n\nErnesto Valverde's team has won five matches across all competitions after an erratic start to the season.\n\nBarcelona plays at Slavia Prague in the Champions League group phase on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
