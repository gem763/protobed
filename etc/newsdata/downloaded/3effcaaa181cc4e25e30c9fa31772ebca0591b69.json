The indictment could shed more light on the pair\u2019s campaign, alongside Giuliani, to discredit former Vice President Joe Biden and remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Masha Yovanovitch. It also signals an intensifying crackdown on illicit campaign contributions, at a moment when Trump\u2019s inaugural committee is under criminal investigation for potentially receiving donations from illegal foreign sources. Parnas and Fruman, born outside the U.S., are alleged to have funneled up to a million dollars in foreign cash into political action committees and campaigns, including Trump\u2019s.\n\nDarren Samuelsohn, senior White House reporter: The news about the Giuliani associates was definitely big. But I\u2019ll throw a curveball here and go with someone we hadn\u2019t been thinking much about of late: Robert Mueller. U.S. District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell\u2019s questions and commentary during a hearing Tuesday suggested she\u2019s leaning toward ordering the release of the special counsel\u2019s grand jury materials. If that happens, she\u2019d be handing House Democrats a bounty of new information in their impeachment inquiry \u2014 the kind of stuff that would become ammunition in an expanding probe beyond Ukraine. The Justice Department would also be all but certain to appeal a ruling from Howell that goes against them, thereby setting up a much bigger fight that seems headed to the Supreme Court.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/5b/48/9e2282cc4bdc8f056865e09c54f9/artboard-1.png\"\n\nAndrew Desiderio, congressional reporter: The biggest development of the week, in my book, came at the tail end when the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld House Democrats\u2019 subpoena for eight years of Trump\u2019s financial records from his accounting firm, Mazars. It\u2019s a huge loss for the president, after having lost a bid to quash the subpoena in a lower court. Trump has done everything he possibly can to avoid his financial records and tax returns from getting into the hands of his political enemies \u2014 and he may have no further recourse this time. But even beyond this specific battle, Friday\u2019s ruling from a three-judge panel gives a big boost to congressional oversight authority. \u201cContrary to the president\u2019s arguments, the committee possesses authority under both the House Rules and the Constitution to issue the subpoena,\u201d one of the judges wrote.\n\nKyle Cheney, congressional reporter: In a week of big developments, the one I think will be most consequential is former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch\u2019s decision to defy the State Department to testify in the House\u2019s impeachment investigation. With her decision, she set a template for other witnesses to come forward even if they\u2019ve been ordered not to \u2014 and already a second State Department ambassador, Gordon Sondland, is preparing to follow suit. Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony itself was significant, too. She obliterated some of the conspiracy theories that led Trump to oust her and revealed that she was given a word of support from John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state, even as Trump pulled her from her post in Ukraine.\n\nJosh Gerstein, legal affairs reporter: I\u2019m going to go off the board (is that allowed?) and say that the most significant impeachment development of the week was Trump\u2019s decision to have U.S. troops stand aside as Turkey invades Syria. Of course, it has nothing directly to do with the current grounds Democrats have asserted for impeachment, but the move shook many of Trump\u2019s key supporters to their core.\n\nPeople who have stridently defended Trump at some cost to their own reputations, like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), were caught completely off guard by the president\u2019s decision to abandon the Kurds \u2014 longtime U.S. allies. Other Trump backers even popped up in unexpected places like MSNBC to denounce the move. Why anyone in the political fight of his life would piss off his closest friends is hard to fathom. The impulsive, widely criticized move and the scramble to clean it up also undercuts arguments from Trump that that his unorthodox telephone diplomacy is as consistently \u201cperfect\u201d as he maintains.\n\nDemocrats aren\u2019t giving any kind of official timeline yet for their plans. Is there really any clock here they need to be worried about?\n\nNatasha: I think some Democrats are wary of the inquiry going too deep into an election year, and forcing an impeachment battle into the middle of the presidential primary contests. It also risks creating sympathy for Trump if it drags on too long. On the other hand, an impeachment inquiry and an election year have never coincided before, so the consequences are tough to predict.\n\nDarren: It sure feels like the unofficial schedule that\u2019s been kicking around \u2014 House impeachment vote around Thanksgiving and Senate trial circa Christmas \u2014 is a tad bit unrealistic. That would suggest the House will do all its investigating, questioning and document gathering over the course of the next five weeks before the Turkey Day break. Sure, that\u2019s possible. But Trump and company are also putting up plenty of roadblocks to slow things down. While their obstinance could just be another impeachment article, it would seem like Democrats may try to do even more due diligence to make sure they\u2019ve got what they need. And that\u2019s especially the case if they think there\u2019s any kind of realistic chance of convincing House Republicans to come along on an impeachment vote, let alone find the 20 Republicans for conviction. I\u2019d also just say that the Democrats at this point are all-in on impeachment and they\u2019re probably calculating that it won\u2019t hurt them on the turnout front once Iowa, New Hampshire and other states start voting in the primaries and caucuses next year.\n\nAndrew: Before the Ukraine scandal blew up, senior Democrats were saying they wanted to reach a decision by the end of the calendar year on whether to recommend articles of impeachment. But with Ukraine now the central focus of their inquiry \u2014 and the near-certainty that Democrats will draw up articles \u2014 that timeline is very much in flux. Moderate and swing-district Democrats have indicated that they don\u2019t want to rush the process, in part so that they could obtain as much evidence as possible to convince both the public and Republicans. They are very wary of the perception that this is a partisan process; and the more evidence they have, the more likely it is that they can convince holdouts to support them. These lawmakers will have 2020 on their minds the entire way, even if they won\u2019t say it publicly.\n\nKyle: The plan right now is there is no plan. House Democrats are operating with the wind at their back for the first time \u2014 polls show their impeachment inquiry is gaining public support and they\u2019re actually generating new information for the first time all year and getting witnesses to testify about substantive episodes that could feed the articles of impeachment they eventually craft. Though some Democrats say they want to turn this momentum into articles as quickly as possible \u2014 perhaps even by early November \u2014 there are more cautious lawmakers who want to make sure they have beefed up their case against Trump enough to maintain public support all the way through the process.\n\nJosh: The bombastic Tuesday letter from the White House declaring plans to stonewall the House impeachment probe and the unexpected arrests of the two Giuliani associates contributes to the growing momentum for impeachment in the House.\n\nThe timeline for impeachment and for the slew of court fights involving the White House will ultimately diverge. Even as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other House leaders hailed key legal victories this week, they seemed to be treating Trump\u2019s continuing resistance as an admission of guilt that leaves the door wide open to voting on impeachment without final resolution from the courts. More information could be useful to Democrats in the impeachment process, but it doesn\u2019t seem essential at this point to a process that appears to be moving to an inexorable conclusion \u2014 at least in the House.\n\nAre we any closer to a Trump conviction in the Senate?\n\nNatasha: Republicans still expect the impeachment process to play out along entirely partisan lines \u2014 i.e., House Democrats vote to impeach, and Senate R\u2019s decline to convict and remove. But as my colleagues Darren Samuelsohn and Burgess Everett wrote on Friday , the political landscape could change quickly depending on what is revealed over the course of the inquiry. Several Republican governors have already come out in favor of an impeachment inquiry, and while they can\u2019t participate directly in the process, it\u2019s at least a signal that GOP support for Trump might not be impenetrable.\n\nDarren: Maybe a tiny bit. Someone I\u2019d always been watching \u2014 Mitt Romney \u2014 is now on the record criticizing the president for pressing both the Ukraine and China to help his 2020 reelection bid. Pretty much everyone else is keeping their powder dry, save an occasional comment from the likes of Ben Sasse or Susan Collins. That\u2019s just about to be expected given we still don\u2019t know what the House will even send over on articles of impeachment. They\u2019ve got no incentive to change that \u2014 for now. And yeah, as Natasha said, I\u2019d definitely recommend our story on this from Friday, which teed up the idea that Trump world is starting to feel a bit nervous even as the president does his best to appear confident the Senate will save him.\n\nAndrew: Ever since Democrats have been contemplating moving forward with impeachment, I\u2019ve thought that Republicans would only break with the president under one condition: if the public turns against Trump so forcefully and overwhelmingly that it\u2019s no longer politically tenable for Republicans to stick with him. Will we reach that moment? Probably not; the president will always have his base voter bloc that will stick with him no matter what. But with public support for impeachment rising steadily in recent weeks, I wouldn\u2019t completely close the door on a Senate conviction. That being said, I would not put money on it.\n\nKyle: Conviction is still a pipe dream in the current political climate. A handful of Senate Republicans are openly critical of Trump, but nowhere close to 20 \u2014 and even the small number who think Trump\u2019s actions are worthy of scrutiny have stopped far short of calling for impeachment proceedings and trial. Politics can change quickly, and Trump picked a strange time to infuriate his allies by rescinding support for Kurds in Syria, but it\u2019ll take several seismic unforeseeable events for the dynamic to change.\n\nJosh: I\u2019m still not seeing overt signs of a collapse in Trump\u2019s Senate support, but it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that when these things happen they tend to happen quickly. Everything looks hunky-dory until the moment that it doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s very little incentive for a GOP senator to go wobbly right now. But the list of prominent GOP officials endorsing an impeachment probe grew a bit longer this week as Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said he believes some House investigation of Trump\u2019s Ukraine diplomacy is necessary . Every Republican who makes a comment like that makes it easier for the next one to follow, which has to worry the White House.\n\nCan Rudy go on as Trump\u2019s lawyer?\n\nNatasha: He\u2019ll probably try \u2014 but there\u2019s a good chance Trump will try to distance himself from him given the indictment of Parnas and Fruman. Giuliani also doesn\u2019t have many allies among congressional Republicans, who have soured on him recently.\n\nGiuliani may also have some legal exposure himself. For example, his dealings with Ukraine may have been a violation of the Logan Act, which aims to prevent private citizens from conducting foreign diplomacy on behalf of the U.S. He could also be vulnerable if he conspired with the president to extort the Ukrainians. Mimi Rocah, a former federal prosecutor from the Southern District of New York, argued in a recent op-ed that DOJ now \u201chas more than enough basis to open a federal criminal investigation into the former New York mayor.\u201d\n\nDarren: Rudy\u2019s lawyer, Jon Sale, told me on Friday that Giuliani is indeed still representing the president. I do think the relationship may be a bit strained right now. And it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll be seeing less of Giuliani on cable TV in the coming weeks \u2014 one would think, right? \u2014 as the feds circle him via the indictments against his associates. But Trump and Giuliani do go way, way, way back \u2014 \u201cMy Rudy\u201d is the president\u2019s nickname for his lawyer \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to imagine they wouldn\u2019t still be talking and strategizing in private.\n\nAndrew: Republicans on Capitol Hill have been privately fuming over Giuliani\u2019s involvement and his penchant to make things worse for the president. There has also been some reporting in recent weeks that even members of Trump\u2019s inner circle within the administration are also frustrated with Giuliani. I\u2019m going to slightly disagree with my colleagues here and say that if those people can convince the president that Giuliani is hurting him more than he\u2019s helping, he could very well cut off Giuliani.\n\nKyle: Trump may need him to. Rudy knows everything about everything and he\u2019s intertwined with all of Trump world. Though I wouldn\u2019t expect to see Giuliani on TV quite as often as the president\u2019s emissary, it\u2019ll be hard to excommunicate him from the inner circle completely, even if his commentary has alienated other Republicans and seems to embroil the president in more legal trouble every time he speaks.\n\nJosh: I think Giuliani will be more or less silenced within a matter of days. No one wants a lawyer who is himself under criminal investigation, according to multiple reports. And someone facing that kind of investigation suddenly has all kinds of conflicts in all his or her cases because it is very hard to negotiate with prosecutors about your own potential liability while doing your best by your clients.\n\nAnother prediction: His talk of testifying before the Senate will devolve into a court battle over that testimony. I can\u2019t imagine Giuliani\u2019s lawyers will want him being publicly grilled by Democrats and be open to potential charges over those answers, when he\u2019d be entirely within his rights to take the Fifth or just claim everything he knows is protected by attorney-client privilege. Those arguments get harder to make when you\u2019re on TV all the time talking, so that\u2019s another reason we will see less of that.\n\nWhat can we expect to see next week?\n\nNatasha: I\u2019ll be watching for any new information that comes out of Fiona Hill\u2019s congressional testimony on Monday. Hill was the special assistant to the president and senior director for European and Russian Affairs on the National Security Council \u2014 aka Trump\u2019s top Russia/Europe adviser \u2014 until just before the infamous Trump-Zelensky call. Hill was crafting policy on Ukraine, Russia and Europe while Giuliani, Sondland and Volker were conducting what was essentially a shadow foreign policy campaign on Ukraine, and she and her team noticed. They were apparently unnerved by it, sources told me, so Hill could probably fill in some blanks for Democrats about what was going on in the NSC at the time \u2014 including the practice of concealing Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders on the NSC\u2019s top secret codeword system.\n\nAndrew: Depositions, depositions and more depositions. Democrats are rapidly gathering evidence in the form of documents, communications and witness testimony in order to establish that Trump abused his office by soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 election. And next week, they\u2019re talking to a few more key witnesses who could contextualize the full extent of Trump\u2019s and Giuliani\u2019s efforts to push Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden.\n\nIn addition, the House is back in session on Tuesday after two weeks back home, so we should have a better idea of how the political landscape has shifted ever since Pelosi declared formalized the impeachment process. Pelosi could also face new pressure to hold a formal vote authorizing an impeachment inquiry \u2014 something she has been hesitant to do amid complaints from Republicans. Democrats largely believe such a vote is unnecessary, but some of the court decisions we\u2019re expecting in the coming days could weigh on Pelosi \u2014 namely, the Mueller grand jury case, in which a federal judge is hearing arguments that center on whether the House is engaged in a formal impeachment inquiry and therefore can access Mueller\u2019s grand jury secrets.\n\nKyle: Lawmakers return from recess for the first time since their impeachment push began in earnest, and since polls began to reflect the changing mood of the country in their favor. I\u2019d expect a frenzied atmosphere on Capitol Hill as lawmakers hash out a timetable to turn their investigation into actual articles of impeachment. It\u2019s going to get messy, especially with a slew of court deadlines that could result in teams of new information landing on Capitol Hill connected to the House\u2019s impeachment efforts.\n\nDarren: Hard to fathom there are technically only four business days next week given how much stuff is indeed packed onto the calendar. There are too many depositions and subpoena deadlines to count, and if many of them are ignored, as expected, the Democrats will have even more impeachment fodder to run with. Just having members of Congress back in Washington is going to amplify things as well. They\u2019ve been scattered around the country since Nancy Pelosi added propellant to the impeachment fire \u2014 and now they\u2019ll be followed at every turn by reporters looking for a comment about where things stand. Rest up this weekend, everyone.\n\nJosh: I predict more talk among returning Democratic lawmakers about a vote to explicitly authorize impeachment proceedings. Don\u2019t think that actually happens next week, but consensus among Dems for that could build. Also continued focus on Giuliani\u2019s role in the Ukraine affair. His clients might enter pleas to the charges next week, which would engender a New York media scrum. And the press will be on to out the Ukrainian official said to have bankrolled and directed their alleged scheme to make straw donations to gain influence in D.C. and with Trump.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/67/bd/dc18a55a4a01b90d96bc1c230a6b/191011-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
