The film, created by conservative director Michael Pack, interviews only Justice Thomas and his wife and is largely sympathetic to the conservative justice, according to Time magazine, which saw saw an advanced screening on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s different sets of rules for different people,\u201d Justice Thomas said in the film, according to Time. \u201cIf you criticize a black person who\u2019s more liberal, you\u2019re a racist. Whereas you can do whatever to me, or to now [HUD Secretary] Ben Carson, and that\u2019s fine, because you\u2019re not really black because you\u2019re not doing what we expect black people to do.\u201d\n\nIn the documentary, Justice Thomas recounted his controversial 1991 confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee and Anita Hill\u2019s allegations of sexual harassment against him.\n\n\u201c\u2018This is the wrong black guy, he has to be destroyed,\u2019\u201d he said, characterizing his political opponents, Time reported. \u201cJust say it. And now at least we\u2019re honest with each other.\n\n\u201cMost of my opponents on the Judiciary Committee cared about only one thing: how would I rule on abortion rights?\u201d he said. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t matter, and your life didn\u2019t matter. What mattered was what they wanted. And what they wanted was this particular issue.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to get rid of me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then after I was there, it was to undermine me.\u201d\n\nAccording to Time, \u201cThomas says his experience in the hearings made him realize that he had been expecting a certain type of person \u2014 as he described them, the \u2018bigot, Klansman, and rural sheriff\u2019 \u2014 to hold him back over the course of his life. But the confirmation hearing changed his mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt turned out that through all of that, ultimately the biggest impediment was the modern day liberal,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Pack interviewed Justice Thomas for more than 30 hours over a six-month period, which wrapped up just before Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court in 2018, Time reported.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
