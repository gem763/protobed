Lorraine Kelly has remained the queen of breakfast television for 35 years", "language": "en", "text": "Unbelievably, Lorraine Kelly will celebrate that landmark birthday next month. Louise Gannon meets the queen of the morning-show sofa to find out how she keeps on top of her game \u2013 and glimpses the steel behind the smile\n\nLorraine wears blouse, Victoria Beckham at Selfridges. Earrings, Pilgrim\n\nTo find out who Lorraine Kelly really is, and how she has managed to weather 35 years in the supposedly fluffy world of breakfast television, just ask her which reality TV show she would like to appear on.\n\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t do Strictly because I can\u2019t dance. And my daughter Rosie says she\u2019d disown me if I went into the jungle. I can\u2019t cook, so no Bake Off or MasterChef.\u2019 There is a pause and a smile. \u2018But I would do SAS: Who Dares Wins. I could do that one. There\u2019s something about it that appeals to me.\u2019\n\nFor those unfamiliar, it involves weeks of hardcore mental and physical challenges based on the Special Air Service\u2019s gruelling recruitment process. Could Lorraine dive into ice pools and crawl through mud? What about being tied up, blindfolded and verbally abused during a lengthy interrogation?\n\nShe folds her hands neatly in the lap of her dark green belted shirtdress, cocks her head slightly to one side, and thinks for a moment. \u2018Yes,\u2019 she says. \u2018I could handle that.\u2019 And there it is. The real steel behind her smile.\n\nViewers caught a glimpse of that when she unleashed a look this summer \u2013 during an awkward TV handover \u2013 when Good Morning Britain\u2019s Susanna Reid asked her if she remembered her former presenting colleague Esther McVey, now a Tory MP, who was sitting alongside Susanna smiling into the camera. \u2018Yep. Yes I do. Right, coming up after half past eight\u2026\u2019 came Lorraine\u2019s uncharacteristically curt response. Social media went into overdrive wondering what dark feud these women were hiding.\n\nMcVey told the press that they had shared a dressing room on breakfast show GMTV in the late 90s, until she had been promoted over Lorraine. Former GMTV colleague Fiona Phillips then waded in, saying McVey had \u2018lied\u2019 about a promotion and had only been there covering Fiona\u2019s maternity leave. \u2018You know what that was,\u2019 Lorraine says. \u2018I\u2019d been sitting on the sofa, reading all the Brexit nonsense and literally shaking my head about how appalling our politicians were, then I look into the monitor and see one of them sitting there. I thought: \u201cI just can\u2019t be bothered with any of you.\u201d She was never promoted; I don\u2019t even think we shared a dressing room. But why should we be surprised at that of a politician? That is now very sadly to be expected. I then heard the whole station was accused of being a Labour cabal, which made me laugh. She did get my \u201clook\u201d, which very few people are on the receiving end of. But there is a look.\u2019\n\nPolo neck, No 21 at Fenwick. Earrings, Monica Vinader\n\nLorraine, who was born into a working-class family from the Gorbals, Glasgow, has remained queen of the studio sofa while her contemporaries \u2013 Selina Scott, Anne Diamond, Ulrika Jonsson, Anthea Turner \u2013 have fallen by the wayside. \u2018It\u2019s a bloody tough business and you have to be tough to survive it. I was told at the beginning of my career that I would never fit in, that I\u2019d never make it, that I wasn\u2019t the \u201cright sort\u201d and I didn\u2019t have the right voice. It hasn\u2019t been an easy ride but I\u2019m still here. Even now I expect a tap on the shoulder telling me to push off, but that\u2019s what keeps you on your toes.\u2019\n\nIn person she is a joy to be with but, make no mistake, Lorraine is no pussycat. Bar a few weeks in 2012 when she was badly injured after falling off a horse during a charity ride, she has never taken a sick day off work: \u2018In the early days, when I was working on [ITV breakfast show] TV-am, I was once so hungover I was practically green but it never occurred to me to call in sick.\u2019 As a news reporter on local television in Scotland she was one of the first on the scene of the horrific Lockerbie disaster in 1988 when a Pan-Am flight was bombed, killing all 259 passengers and 11 more on the ground. And she can handle tough interviewees \u2013 from \u2018bored\u2019 Bruce Willis to the difficult Harrison Ford and a grief-stricken Bob Geldof.\n\nToday, we are sitting in a converted warehouse a stone\u2019s throw from the studio where she presents her long-running ITV show Lorraine, which is having something of a moment, with viewing figures the highest they\u2019ve been in almost a decade. Twice this year she\u2019s been acknowledged for her outstanding contribution to British TV, in March at the Royal Television Awards and last month at the TV Choice Awards.\n\nThis month \u2013 a matter of weeks before her 60th birthday in November \u2013 sees the release of her first self-help book, Shine. It is very Lorraine: no psychobabble, no self-indulgence, no nonsense, just matter-of-fact advice. The book is based on her own experiences, from looking your best to dealing with bullying, anxiety, menopause, friendships, parents and parenthood. It is the sort of age-old female wisdom and compassionate common sense a mother would pass on.\n\nThere is one story in particular that gets right to the heart of the sort of woman Lorraine is, though it is not something that would be allowed to happen in today\u2019s more politically correct world. In 1994, after taking three months\u2019 maternity leave from her job co-hosting GMTV with Eamonn Holmes, she was sacked two weeks before she was due to return to work and replaced by the then golden girl Anthea Turner.\n\n\u2018I cried,\u2019 she says. \u2018I felt absolutely terrible. I\u2019d just had a baby. We had an enormous mortgage, I was the main earner but both myself and my husband are freelancers [her husband Steve Smith is a cameraman] and this job that I loved had gone. It was an awful time.\n\n\u2018I remember going to meet people in TV, trying to get a job. It was back in the days when there were no places for breastfeeding so I\u2019d be sitting in a loo feeding Rosie, looking exhausted, breasts leaking, still carrying my baby weight and feeling just awful.\u2019\n\nIronically, GMTV asked her back a month later because they\u2019d won a large sponsorship deal with a baby-food manufacturer and wanted a short mother-and-baby slot. Anthea had no children so new mother Lorraine was perfect. \u2018Of course your instinct is to tell them to shove it. But I\u2019m not daft so I said yes.\u2019\n\nI ask her how she felt about Anthea sitting in her seat on the sofa. She shakes her head. \u2018It wasn\u2019t her fault. These decisions are made by the men upstairs. I remember walking in on my first day and seeing her. I gave her a hug and told her it was a great job and to enjoy it.\u2019 She pauses. \u2018Of course that felt weird, but I was never going to cry; I was never going to scream and rage. Career-wise I had nothing, so the most I could do was keep my dignity and do the best I could with my new little job.\u2019\n\nThat \u2018little job\u2019 was the making of Lorraine. It got her off the early morning sofa, proved a massive hit with viewers and morphed into the post-breakfast show we now know as Lorraine. This story of turning a lemon into lemonade is something of a leitmotif in Lorraine\u2019s life.\n\nShirt, Matthew Adams Dolan at mytheresa.com. Earrings, Monica Vinader. Bracelet, Deborah Blyth\n\nAt school the round, bespectacled kid with the thick East End Glasgow accent was bullied for being a swot and immaculately dressed up every day \u2013 complete with a big fat bow in her hair. \u2018That bow,\u2019 she says, \u2018It made me even more of a target.\u2019 But she continued to wear it and never cried to her parents about being pushed around. She won over a few close friends, got top marks and, by the age of 18, was on her way to university to study English and Russian when she was offered a job on her local newspaper. Her father John, a TV repair man, and her mother Anne were devastated that their clever daughter \u2018was not going to be in a photo on the mantelpiece in a cap and gown, the first Kelly to go to university\u2019. But as much as she loved them \u2013 she still speaks to them most days \u2013 Lorraine knew her future lay in news. (She was overcome with emotion on her 35th anniversary show earlier this month when her parents appeared via cameralink. She said of her father, \u2018He\u2019s not very well but he\u2019s doing good, he\u2019s getting there.\u2019)\n\nShe left the newspaper to join BBC Scotland and in 1984, after years of working as a researcher, she thought she would be offered a job as an on-screen reporter. \u2018My boss looked me dead in the eye and told me it was never going to happen, I had no chance because no one on television spoke like me,\u2019 she says. \u2018But I knew I was good. I knew I could do the job, so I decided that if they didn\u2019t like me I would look elsewhere.\u2019 She met TV executive Bruce Gyngell, who gave her a job as Scottish correspondent at TV-am. \u2018He said, \u201cPeople are going to like you because you\u2019re not glamorous and you sound like people on the street.\u201d It might have been a backhanded compliment but it was a golden opportunity for me.\u2019\n\nThe rest is, of course, television history and now, as she turns 60, Ms Kelly has hit her prime. Not only is her career going strong, she\u2019s looking better than ever. \u2018I used to have terrible fashion sense,\u2019 she laughs. \u2018And I had no idea about the right food to eat, so I\u2019ve learnt all these things from working with stylists, make-up artists and nutritionists along the way. I soak it all up, I exercise and I look after myself. I\u2019m not high maintenance; I possess one pair of earrings [diamond studs given to her by her husband] and my wedding ring. But I\u2019m happy in myself. Happy and proud to be 60. I love it when people tell me I look great for 60. I don\u2019t want to be any younger. Life gets better and better.\u2019\n\nWe talk about Steve, the man she met in 1984 when she started at TV-am. \u2018He was my cameraman. We were a tiny team of four people but when he walked in the room I knew he was the man I was going to marry. It took me a year to get him to ask me out on a date, then that was it.\u2019\n\nThere has never been a whiff of scandal attached to her marriage. Their choice to put Rosie through the Scottish school system meant that they spent 13 years with Lorraine living in London during the week and home for long weekends, but she has never worried about Steve straying. Has he ever worried about her? She laughs. \u2018The thought would be ridiculous. I\u2019ve been chatted up once in my life, by Smokey Robinson. He asked me out on a date, I said I was busy.\u2019\n\nThen there was the incident with Robert Downey Jr. Again she laughs, \u2018That was years ago. I was hosting This Morning alongside Jeremy Kyle, of all people, on one of his first presenting jobs. Robert Downey Jr came in rather well refreshed and as he sat down he leaned over and said, \u201cNice t*ts.\u201d Jeremy was very gentlemanly and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t say that to her.\u201d I don\u2019t think Mr Downey Jr batted an eyelid and I just moved on.\u2019\n\nWay before the #MeToo movement, then? She nods. \u2018That was back in the days when we just put up with all that nonsense. Thank God my daughter\u2019s generation will never have to tolerate that sort of behaviour.\u2019\n\nSuit, Dries Van Noten at Harvey Nichols. Earrings, Pilgrim\n\nThe conversation turns to Rosie, who is now 25 and living in Singapore where she works for a marketing company. Their relationship was unconventional due to the amount of time Lorraine spent away working, but Rosie has never been in any doubt of her mother\u2019s love. \u2018I always made sure when I was home that I was 100 per cent focused on her and the family. I listened to her a lot \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t be on my mobile or scanning emails. It drives me nuts when I see mums doing that when their kids are trying to talk to them.\n\n\u2018It was hard leaving her. Every weekend I would fly home on Thursday night and leave on the last flight on Sunday. I remember one time she was really poorly but I had to leave her. I knew she would be absolutely fine with Steve yet I cried all the way back to London. But we got used to it. I\u2019m good at compartmentalising. Very good. London was work, Scotland was home. I rarely socialised in London. I wasn\u2019t in a gang at school and I\u2019m still not in a gang in TV. I\u2019ve never been interested in flashy parties or hanging out with the big bosses from work. I\u2019d always rather do my job then get home to my real life.\u2019\n\nRight now, her \u2018real life\u2019 is in Cookham, Berkshire, where she relocated with Steve (they still have a home in Scotland) after Rosie left for Singapore \u2013 and Lorraine had shed a few tears over her empty nest.\n\nOn a recent trip to India, Lorraine was praised for posting several make-up-free snaps. \u2018I can\u2019t bear these perfect Instagram pictures with all these filters and pouts. I post pictures of myself straight after a Zumba class because I am exactly the same as every other woman my age who does an exercise class \u2013you get hot and sweaty, you don\u2019t look your best but you have a great big smile on your face because you\u2019ve done it.\u2019\n\nIt is exactly the message she puts across in her book: be real, make the most of yourself and your opportunities, and \u2018have a blast\u2019. I ask her if she is doing anything special for her 60th birthday. \u2018My team on Lorraine has bought me the present of a lifetime \u2013 I\u2019m going to train to be an astronaut. I\u2019m fascinated by space. I always wanted to be an astronaut and there\u2019s a little part of me that imagines if all the experts and astronauts disappeared, there could be this one 60-year-old Scottish woman sent into space to save everyone.\u2019\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure: we would be in very capable hands.\n\nShine by Lorraine Kelly, to be published by Century on 31 October, price \u00a320.
