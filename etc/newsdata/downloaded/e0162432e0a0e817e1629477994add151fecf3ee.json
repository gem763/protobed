It threatens people, businesses and communities across this island, but particularly in Derry where travelling across the border for work, to visit family or to socialise is a basic part of our lives,\u201d he told a press conference at the Playhouse theatre in the city.\n\n\u201cWe know the scale of the challenge we\u2019re facing. The time for talking is now over; now it\u2019s time to take control of our own future, stand up for ourselves and vote Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit down.\n\n\u201cThis is a time for leadership. I understand that, when the stakes are this high, you have to be prepared to take on the uncomfortable and the unprecedented.\u201d\n\nMr Eastwood confirmed that, if elected, he will vote against Brexit in the House of Commons.\n\nMs McCallion does not take her seat at Westminster in line with Sinn Fein\u2019s longstanding abstentionist policy.\n\nMr Eastwood added: \u201cAt a time when communities like ours should be setting the agenda, we need our first team on the pitch. Instead, Derry is on the sidelines. That\u2019s not acceptable.\n\n\u201cThis is a defining election. It is a moment of choice and a moment for change. I am not content to continue with the direction of travel. I will not sit idly by as our interests are undermined. Brexit can be stopped at Westminster. SDLP MPs will vote to stop Brexit.\u201d\n\nSinn Fein confirmed last month that Ms McCallion will be running to retake the seat if a general election is called.", "description": "Colum Eastwood will run as a candidate in Foyle where his party lost its long-held seat to Sinn Fein in the 2017 poll.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/11/wire-20370888-1572433772-982_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
