There\u2019s a decent chance that Spokane, Wash., will feature in your search.\n\nA new report from Realtor.com examined the 100 largest metropolitan areas nationwide for cross-market demand. Researchers studied views of Realtor.com listings, comparing how many people from out-of-town were looking at homes in a city versus how many locals were looking to move away.\n\nSpokane has the highest inbound-outbound ratio, meaning significantly more people from out of the area were considering moving there compared with locals who were considering migrating elsewhere.\n\nRead more: Rent control may not be a lifeline for California\u2019s renters\n\nAnd affordability was a clear driver of the interest in Spokane. The median list price for properties viewed in Spokane by out-of-towners was 21.8% lower than the median list price in their home markets. Over a third of the people considering moving to Spokane currently live in Seattle, which has seen its home prices skyrocket thanks to its burgeoning job market.\n\nHere are the 10 cities attracting the most cross-market demand for their homes:\n\nRank Metro Q3 2019 inbound/outbound ratio Median listing price viewed versus viewer home market median listing price 1 Spokane-Spokane Valley, Wash. 2.9 -21.8% 2 Deltona-Daytona Beach-Ormond Beach, Fla. 2.6 -16.4% 3 McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas 2.5 -32.7% 4 Charleston-North Charleston, S.C. 2.4 19.2% 5 Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville, Fla. 2.4 -15.5% 6 Portland-South Portland, Maine 2.3 10.6% 7 North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, Fla. 2.3 3.9% 8 Cape Coral-Fort Myers, FL 2.3 -4.7% 9 El Paso, Texas 2.3 -33.6% 10 Lakeland-Winter Haven, Fla. 2.2 -29.1%\n\nNot all people looking to buy a home in another city are looking to move permanently though. For instance, in Charlotte, N.C., out-of-town prospective buyers generally looked at properties that were more expensive than the ones where they live. \u201cThis dynamic could be explained by wealthier shoppers looking for vacation homes or higher-end properties in these metros,\u201d Sabrina Speianu, a senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, wrote in the report.\n\n(Realtor.com is operated by News Corp NWSA, -0.07% subsidiary Move Inc., and MarketWatch is a unit of Dow Jones, which is also a subsidiary of News Corp.)\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, San Jose, Calif., had the lowest inbound-outbound ratio, meaning that it had a much higher share of people looking to leave the city relative to those looking to move there. Other expensive cities that similarly had residents looking to buy homes elsewhere include San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nAlso see: Mortgage rates rise to highest level since August\n\nNotably, the cross-market demand in the greater Washington, D.C., metro area declined significantly over the past year. Home prices in some DC-area suburbs have skyrocketed since Amazon AMZ, +0.28% announced it would build its second headquarters in the area. As a result, fewer people may be looking to move there as affordability has gotten worse.", "description": "The quest for affordability is forcing people to get out of town.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU041_spokan_ZG_20191025140316.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
