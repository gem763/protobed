Bill Weld \u2015 who\u2019s waging an uphill battle against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination \u2015 says it\u2019s clear the president committed treason by allegedly seeking election assistance from Ukraine.\n\nDuring a Monday appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Weld said the potential case against Trump couldn\u2019t be more obvious amid reports that he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to help attorney Rudy Giuliani with a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not just undermining democratic institutions,\u201d Weld said. \u201cThat is treason. It\u2019s treason, pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe penalty on the Constitution is removal from office, and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal,\u201d he added.\n\n\"That's not just undermining democratic institutions.
