Rates dipped in the 1990s following publication of a report linking MMR to autism, but partly recovered after that research was discredited and disproved.\n\nHowever, the volume of anti-vaccine sentiment on social media has been swelling and in March, the head of NHS England warned \"vaccination deniers\" were gaining traction online.\n\nSpeaking at the event organised by the Huffington Post, Mr Hancock said: \"I'm very worried about falling rates of vaccinations - especially measles.\n\n\"For measles, the falling vaccination rates are a serious problem and it is unbelievable that Britain has lost its measles-free status.\"\n\nHe added: \"The worst thing is if you don't vaccinate your child and you can, then the person you are putting at risk is not only just your own child, but it's also the child that cant be vaccinated for medical reasons.\n\n\"Maybe they have cancer and their immune system is too weak.\n\n\"I don't want the debate to put people off because there is absolute clarity on what the science says and what the right thing is to do.\"\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Matt Hancock says unvaccinated children were \"putting other children at risk\"\n\nThe health secretary has said before he was willing to look at \"all options\" to boost England's vaccination levels, including compulsory immunisation - and while he did not want to \"reach the point\" of imposing jabs, he would \"rule nothing out\".\n\nMr Hancock appeared to firm up his stance at the conference in Manchester on Sunday.\n\n\"When the state provide service to people then it's a two-way street,\" he said. \"You have to take your responsibilities too.\n\n\"I have received advice from inside government this week on how we would go about it and I am looking into it very seriously.\"\n\nMeasles is highly infectious and can cause serious health complications, including damaging the lungs and brain.\n\nThere were more than 82,500 cases in Europe in 2018 - the highest number in a decade and three times the total reported in 2017.\n\nIn England, the proportion of children receiving both doses of the MMR jab by their fifth birthday has fallen over the last four years to 87.2%.\n\nThis is below the 95% said to provide \"herd immunity\", the level considered by experts to protect a population from a disease.", "description": "Matt Hancock says there is \"absolute clarity\" on the science and not being immunised puts others at risk.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10091/production/_98018656_gettyimages-636346346.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
