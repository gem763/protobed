That followed overnight comments from U.S. President Donald\n\nTrump, who said work toward ending the trade dispute was going\n\nwell, while White House adviser Larry Kudlow said tariffs\n\nscheduled for December could be withdrawn if progress is made.\n\n\"There's been no fresh reason to query the broadly positive\n\nmood after the meeting in Washington,\" said Westpac FX\n\nstrategist Sean Callow, adding that optimism around a Brexit\n\nbreakthrough further reinforced the improved sentiment.\n\nThe dollar was marginally stronger against the Japanese yen\n\n, hitting a high for the week of 108.72 per dollar.\n\nIt lifted from an overnight two-month low on the euro\n\nto steady at $1.1149 and was a shade weaker against a basket of\n\ncurrencies at 97.312. The trade-exposed Korean won\n\nKRW=KFTC hit 1,169.4 per dollar, its highest since July 5.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar was the biggest gainer in\n\nAsian hours, rising 0.3% to a five-week high of $0.6424 as short\n\nsellers pared positions. The Australian dollar AUD=D3 also hit\n\na five-week peak of $0.6883 though moves were slight and it kept\n\nbelow resistance around $0.6895. The Canadian dollar - the best performing G10 currency this\n\nyear - hit a three-month high of 1.3071 per dollar as Prime\n\nMinister Justin Trudeau looked on track to retain power in a\n\nclose-run election. His ruling liberals will form a minority government, the\n\nCanadian Broadcasting Corp projected, as results rolled in.\n\nThe pound awaits Brexit developments to determine its fate.\n\nWith just over a week before Britain is due to leave the\n\nEuropean Union, Boris Johnson's push to re-run a parliamentary\n\nvote he lost on the weekend was rejected.\n\nBut he has resolved to press on with seeking to pass\n\nBrexit-related laws in parliament on Tuesday, with their\n\nprogress to determine the timeline.\n\n\"While markets haven't seen fit to reverse last week's\n\noptimism that saw sterling smartly higher they aren't yet\n\nprepared to take the pound up to the next level,\" said National\n\nAustralia Bank Head of FX Strategy Ray Attrill.", "description": "FOREX-Trade hopes buttress dollar; loonie lifts as Trudeau clings to power", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA5T0DN_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
