The district said its policy regarding political campaign materials \u201cis in place to ensure the school system remains neutral on political issues and the focus remains on our students.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis policy does not prohibit students from speaking their minds or engaging in protected First Amendment activities,\u201d the district said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cBecause the cheerleaders were in uniform and were acting as representatives of the school, the display of the sign could be perceived as the school or school system endorsing a political campaign.\u201d\n\nBut some conservatives have criticized the athletic association\u2019s probation as a violation of student rights. \u201cI am appalled these students are being punished for exercising their First Amendment right to free speech,\u201d North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson wrote in a letter to the North Carolina High School Athletic Association on Tuesday. \u201d\n\n\u201cAs leaders, we should be encouraging America\u2019s youth to participate in our democracy and political process \u2013 not punishing and silencing them. These North Stanly students respectfully displayed a sign and took a picture. They did not cause a scene, participate in a protest or break any school code of conduct.\u201d\n\nJust sent @nchsaa a letter questioning the recent probation of North Stanly High School cheerleaders. I'm appalled these students are being punished for exercising their First Amendment right to free speech. The NCHSAA should immediately reconsider this unfair punishment. pic.twitter.com/UUQIjiaKBM \u2014 Richard Hudson (@RepRichHudson) September 17, 2019\n\nWhile the landmark Supreme Court decision Tinker v. Des Moines established that students and teachers do not \u201cshed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,\u201d K-12 public schools have more leeway than other public institutions when it comes to regulating speech. They\u2019re generally allowed to restrict speech if it poses a \u201csubstantial disruption\u201d to the school\u2019s educational mission or to the rights of other students.\n\nSeparately, cheerleaders at Lake Hamilton High School in Arkansas sparked similar controversy last week for holding a banner at a football game on Sept. 13 that read, \u201cMake America Great Again. Trump The Leopards\u201d \u2014 a reference to the mascot for the opposing team. Democratic state Sen. Joyce Elliott called the sign \u201ctotally inappropriate,\u201d while Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington defended it as a funny \u201cplay on words.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, reported by KFSM, the Lake Hamilton School District said the banner \u201cwas not intended to make a political statement or endorsement\u201d and said \u201cthe district has taken steps to ensure that all future banners do not mention or reference political or controversial issues.\u201d", "description": "Some have criticized the move as a violation of students' free speech", "authors": ["Katie Reilly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0BQBxM2UCF51Jjs2UKZI7g--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/a7fdfaf330590fd381ba2f7d068e59b7", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
