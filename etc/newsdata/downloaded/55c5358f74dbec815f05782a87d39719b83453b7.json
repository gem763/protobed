Its advisory business, with around 10,000 employees, supports the audit team when needed, KPMG said. The shuffling will conclude at the end of the month, the end of the company\u2019s financial year.\n\nKPMG earlier this year said it would increase oversight of its U.K. audit unit.\n\nThe company is still under investigation by the U.K. Financial Reporting Council for its audits of Carillion PLC, a British construction firm that went out of business at the beginning of last year.\n\nThe Financial Reporting Council, Britain\u2019s regulator for audit and accounting, on Thursday criticized as ineffective the quality of mandatory transparency reports published by U.K. audit firms, including by KPMG.\n\n\u201cThe FRC is concerned that many firms treat the reports wrongly as a marketing tool which damages their perception among stakeholders and limits their usefulness,\u201d the watchdog said in a release.\n\nPwC said its transparency report sets out the actions the company is taking to improve audit quality, while Ernst & Young said it would act on the FRC\u2019s feedback.\n\nDeloitte, KPMG and Mazars LLP declined to comment on the FRC review. BDO LLP didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "The professional services firm said it is working to give its audit practice greater independence from the rest of the business.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-111435/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
