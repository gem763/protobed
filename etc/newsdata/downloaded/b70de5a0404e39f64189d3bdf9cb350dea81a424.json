You can work for so many years and all you get to show for it is a piece of paper. I really wanted more out of life than this,\" he said.\n\n\"The idea of working another 30 years in a cubicle and missing out on life was crazy to me.\"\n\n(Image: Our Rich Journey /SWNS.COM)\n\nHe shared his thoughts with wife Christina who embraced the plan - starting their eight year journey to work freedom.\n\nOn their quest for an early retirement, both Amom and Christina became Uber and Lyft drivers to earn extra cash and sold any spare belongings on Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace.\n\nThe Brownings also took advantage of credit card sign up bonuses, cashing in on the free flights and hotel points - meaning they still took a vacation every year.\n\nAmon, who was on a salary of \u00a376,000 as an urban planner, and Christina, who earned \u00a354,000 as a federal attorney, insist anybody can retire early if they follow their example and join the Financial Independence Retire Early movement, known as FIRE.\n\nHow we saved up \u00a31.6million for an early retirement\n\n(Image: Our Rich Journey /SWNS.COM)\n\nBuying and renovating homes Investing wisely - the couple began investing all their extra money in low cost index funds.

Lifestyle changes\n\n\"The FIRE journey is all about saving money, making money and investing that money. But before you do all that, you have to believe that you can do it. It's about your mindset,\" he said.\n\nBut they admit it took a while to get their heads around the idea of retiring by 40.\n\n\"It was a bizarre thought. We'd never seen anyone do it, definitely not someone with kids, but we thought: what can we do to make this happen?\"\n\nThe couple devised a 10 -year plan which they hoped would make them financially independent and able to retire by 2021.\n\nAnd in July this year, they finally gave up the 9-5.\n\n(Image: Our Rich Journey /SWNS.COM)\n\n\"The big things are finding ways to save more and ways to make more,\" Christina said.\n\nThey began their plan in 2013 and started flipping homes, buying their first fixer upper in the San Francisco area by putting just 3% of the property price down, which was $17,000 - \u00a313,000.\n\nAmon said their process was to \"live and flip\".\n\n\"We lived in the home and put in our own sweat and labour doing it up. We sold it, took the equity and did the same thing again.\n\n\"We did it on three properties and turned that $17,000 into a little over $400,000 in profit.\"\n\nChristina said: \"We didn't come from wealthy families, we didn't have a lot of money, we had to look for the properties that nobody else wanted.\n\n\"By the time we sold them, we had turned them into incredibly beautiful properties. They became the houses that everyone was overbidding to get.\"\n\nThey took into account the best time of year to buy properties, which were in between Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\n\"We looked in the off-season. During that period, you have no competition looking for a home,\" Amom said.\n\n(Image: Our Rich Journey /SWNS.COM)\n\nThey also made changes in their lifestyle including trading in their brand new BMW SUV for a \u00a3600 minivan.\n\n\"The shift in mindset from going from a luxury car to a minivan was actually incredibly freeing,\" Christina said.\n\nThe couple also explored other side hustles, selling any spare belongings on Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace.\n\nThey even signed up to become Uber and Lyft drivers and say they earned \u00a320,000 without ever having to pick up any passengers.\n\nAmon said: \"For a period, we drove for Uber and Lyft in the San Francisco bay area.\n\n\"For us, it was all about the hack. The companies were giving $40 an hour just to turn on the app.\"\n\n\"We would literally get no rides but we'd still get the sign-up bonus.\n\n\"I think we made $26,000 just on this Uber and Lyft hack, not driving at all.\"\n\nThe couple also began investing all their extra money in low cost index funds.\n\n(Image: Our Rich Journey /SWNS.COM)\n\nAmon said: \"We took a very simple approach... You start off with investing all your tax advantage accounts - the ones you have at work, your retirement funds.\n\n\"In our 401k, we invested in an index fund that tracked the stock markets, we weren't dabbling in individual stocks.\n\n\"The return on the stock market is historically 8-10% so we just put our extra money into the index funds.\"\n\nBut the couple still wanted to enjoy life and took full advantage of 'travel hacks' to take the family with their children Sunoa, 13, and Melea, 11, on vacations to Thailand, Hawaii, Singapore and Europe without being left out of pocket.\n\nAmon said: \"While we were on this journey, we still wanted to enjoy life with our children. We had to be very strategic when we planned our vacations.\n\n\"Travel hacking is taking advantage of sign up bonuses on credit cards.\n\n\"A credit card would have a huge sign up bonus like two free flights and so many points to spend on hotels. Once we had the bonus, we would be done with the card.\n\n\"We would wash and repeat that every year to go on vacation.\"\n\nThe couple dispelled the notion that people with children can't save enough to retire early.\n\n(Image: Our Rich Journey /SWNS.COM)\n\nAmon said: \"When people say that children are expensive - you make children expensive if you are trying to give them the world.\n\n\"People will go broke for their children but they won't become rich for them.\n\n\"We've seen people overspend on toys and activities. But we never found our children to be expensive. We have a minimalist mindset.\n\n\"We certainly never deprived our children of anything. We didn't give out gifts at Christmas but we went on trips.\n\n\"Our girls can remember that they were in Paris on Christmas Day or in Singapore or in Thailand.\"\n\nIn 2016 the couple moved to Japan with work, where they lived rent-free.\n\n\"We had free housing and our utilities were covered,\" said Amon.\n\n\"That was a huge area of savings. We got to the point that we were saving up to 70% of our income and investing it.\"\n\nAfter three years with free accommodation, the couple hit their financial independence savings goal two years earlier than expected and were able to retire in July this year.\n\nAmon described handing in his notice as \"the most amazing feeling in the world\".\n\n\"Talk about freedom. It was like everything was falling into place and having the confidence to go into work and say: ''I'm sorry, this is my last two weeks here'' was the most amazing feeling in the world.\"\n\nThe couple spend their time with their children, taking Portuguese classes, traveling around Europe and focusing on their physical fitness, with Christina swimming and Amon playing basketball.\n\n\"We just know how fortunate we are to have this lifestyle.\n\n\"Some people don't get this until they are 65 years old and they have less time to enjoy it. We have so much time.\"\n\nAmon said: \"There are so many things that are amazing about Portugal - the weather, the education, the health care and the low cost of living.\"\n\nThe family's outgoings now average at around \u00a33,500 a month.", "description": "Christina, 41, and Amon Browning, 39,\u00a0 took up second jobs, including working as Uber drivers, on their mission to move their family to Portugal", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Our Rich Journey", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20742750.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_EARLY_RETIREMENT_007.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
