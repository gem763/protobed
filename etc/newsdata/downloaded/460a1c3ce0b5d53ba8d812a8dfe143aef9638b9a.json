About 600 customers have reserved trips, which cost about $250,000 for a 2.5-hour flight.\n\nThere are several differences between a direct listing and a traditional initial public offering.\n\nBy going public through a direct listing, Virgin\u2019s shares don\u2019t have a set price or supply and the company avoids having to pay potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in fees.\n\nFor investors, it means there\u2019s no lock-up period preventing the sale of shares. It also means the likelihood of higher volatility, at least in the near term, amid the process of price discovery.\n\nVirgin Galactic will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SPCE.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cThere is something about this that captured the public's imagination, and it is different than everything else,\u201d Tusk concluded. \u201cSo even if it's overvalued, it's definitely cool.\u201d", "description": "'There is something about this that captured the public's imagination, and it is different than everything else.'", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/07/0/0/Richard-Branson-Virgin-Galactic.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
