They grow as tiny cabbagelike buds on a large inedible stalk.\n\nWhen buying brussels sprouts, look for tightly closed, green leaves; any signs of yellowing mean they are most likely past their prime. They should give off an earthy, almost herbaceous aroma. The buds shouldn\u2019t smell cabbage-y.\n\nThey grow larger as the season progresses, appearing small and delicate at the beginning of fall, but one size generally fits all. Buy 1\u00bd pounds of untrimmed brussels sprouts to feed four to six people (depending on what else is on the menu).\n\nIf you\u2019re charmed by the ones on the stalk at the farmers\u2019 market (a true oddity if you\u2019ve never seen them), know that their yield may be smaller than you hoped for, and plan accordingly.\n\nTo clean them, trim the ends and rinse in a large bowl of cold water. Brussels sprouts aren\u2019t an especially dirty vegetable, but any dust or sediment should float to the bottom. Transfer to a colander and pat dry before storing them in a resealable bag.\n\nStore them in the crisper or vegetable drawer of the refrigerator, where they can stay fresh for up to a week and a half.", "description": "For decades, brussels sprouts battled a bad reputation. But the ways they\u2019re being cooked now would make any vegetable jealous: roasted with honey and harissa until crispy; saut\u00e9ed with salty sausage and topped with pickled red onions; doused with cream and baked with cheese until thick and bubbling. Here are five simple methods for cooking brussels sprouts, which are more versatile than greens and just as delicious.", "authors": ["Alison Roman", "A Guide", "Mark Bittman", "Sam Sifton", "Tara Parker-Pope", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Julia Moskin", "Molly O'Neill", "Melissa Clark", "Julia Moskin And Melissa Clark"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/09/dining/09BRUSSELS-GUIDE3/09BRUSSELS-GUIDE3-superJumbo-v3.jpg", "published_at": "2016-11-09"}
