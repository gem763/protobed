A ratbag, freeloading magpie was spotted skitching a ride on the back of a wedge-tailed eagle, in what\u2019s possibly the most Tony Hawk move of the bird world.\n\nThe fluke photo was snapped by bird photographer Nichole Wescombe in Avalon just outside of Melbourne when a magpie was pissed off by a bloody wedgie and decided the best thing to do would be to swoop it. There are simply no rules in the animal kingdom, and you protect the nest at all costs. Even if it means you gotta kick up a blue with a literal bird of prey.\n\nSo ok maybe the maggie isn\u2019t skitching on the tail feathers of the eagle, slipping into the big bird\u2019s wake and careening along as lightning speeds, it\u2019s actually just really fucken pissed that a wedge-tailed eagle would fly close enough to the magpie\u2019s nest (and prob screaming children) that it needed to have a go.\n\nGod that\u2019s a hell of a shot.\n\nNichole captioned the series of photos saying that she watched as the magpie chased the wedgie eagle around before she took a bunch of very good photos of the chaos full flight.\n\nReally though, it looks like the maggie is hitching a ride on the back of the eagle like a skateboarder hanging onto the back of a ute, or a surfer on the back of a jetski about to drop into a monster wave, throw a huge shakas, and praying to God they don\u2019t get totally wiped out.\n\nFuck whatever coat of arms this country has, this picture should be the new Australian emblem. Put it on all important documents and broadcast it at every major event.\n\nHell, put it on my headstone. I love this bloody pic so much and I wish to always be the magpie.\n\nOr this one.", "description": "A shot of a magpie swooping a wedge-tailed eagle in Melbourne has the kind of energy that I wish to both harness and exude.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/magpire-eagle-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
