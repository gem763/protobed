How will you restore this?\u201d\n\nReading the questions from a tablet computer on his desk in Number 10, Johnson told Ms Spence that he was \u201con your side\u201d and said in answer to Mr Young\u2019s question that the government would \u201cshow that we mean what we say by coming out of Europe\u201d.\n\nOther questioners asked if he could confirm that he would take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal and why Britain could not simply leave the EU immediately.\n\nIn his reply, the PM said that every extra week spent in the EU cost the UK \u00a3250 million, in clear contradiction to his referendum campaign claim - branded misleading by the official statistician at the time - that Britain was handing over \u00a3350 million a week to Brussels.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

That\u2019s the real failure of democracy.\n\n\u201cWhen people say why have you decided to have this Queen\u2019s Speech, there\u2019s a very simple answer to that - we need to push on with measures to improve our NHS, improve our education\u2026 That\u2019s what the public want us to do.\n\n\u201cOf course if opposition members of parliament disagree with our approach, then it is always open to them to take up the offer I made twice that we should have an election. There is nothing more democratic in this country than a general election. We\u2019ve invited them to accept that offer twice and for mysterious reasons of their own they have declined.\u201d\n\nOne questioner accused Mr Johnson of running an authoritarian regime, but he brushed the suggestion aside, saying: \u201cI must disagree with you in your characterisation of the government.\u201d\n\nSpeaking two days after he closed the doors of parliament to MPs, Mr Johnson said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a very good thing to bring democracy directly to everybody at home, and it\u2019s really great to be speaking directly to so many of you. I worry that people feel disconnected from politics and this is a kind of answer.\u201d", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson failed to address allegations that he misled the Queen as he appeared in public for the first time since a court ruled his suspension of parliament was unlawful.
