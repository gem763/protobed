It's impossible to forget it. I can hear them screaming to death because I was there.\n\n'I can feel them clinging onto life but in vain.

'When I left Syria it was a dreadful situation...you look for places of safety when your children could grow up and where there will be a future for them.'\n\nRobinson arrived in the UK at the weekend.

Shivering and hallucinations as your body battles to keep vital organs active The first step in freezing to death is a raised heart rate and an increase in breathing as your blood seeks to protect internal organs by slowing the flow to the extremities. In an attempt to generate heat, your body will now start to shiver. Hypothermia takes just 10 minutes to set in at -1C (30.F). Organs shut down and the body goes into shock when the heart struggles to pump blood. At this point your liver and kidneys are at risk of failing. Once your body temperature is below 35C (95F), every one-degree drop reduces your brain's ability to produce oxygen by three to five per cent. This causes weakness and confusion and, once you're below 33C (91F), amnesia. Your body gives up shivering once below 31C (88F). Your blood thickens and oxygen intake drops by 25 per cent. The body feels a desperate need to urinate as the kidneys try to process excess fluids forced in by the constriction of your extremities. The heat stops functioning properly once your temperature hits 30C (86F) and pumps 66 per cent less blood than usual. Hallucinations occur due to the lack of oxygen and slow metabolism of the brain. Nerve damage causes people to lose rationality at this point, leading some to undress despite the freezing conditions. Others have been known to burrow and enter small spaces in an apparent attempt of self-protection before they inevitably die.\n\nToday he told Good Morning Britain that the UK and its 'hostile environment' bears some responsibility for the people smuggling trade.\n\n\u2018I think it exists because governments like Britain doesn\u2019t have safer means to travel,' he said.\n\n\u2018If there was civilised and ways that people can have safe passage then I wouldn\u2019t have risked my life - I wouldn\u2019t have been in that container.'\n\nAnother refugee who fled the Taliban, Sabir Zazai, who is now chief executive of the Scottish Refugee Council, told the Daily Mirror of his ordeal being crammed into a truck with other migrants.\n\n'It was ink black and we were so squashed our legs were tucked up and there was no room to stand,' he said. 'My main memory of that final journey is the terror I felt. Each moment felt like my life was ending.'\n\nEssex police began a murder inquiry yesterday as they attempted to establish who the migrants were and which country they had travelled from.\n\nLike thousands of others before them, the group are thought to have sneaked inside the container at the busy Belgian shipping port of Zeebrugge, where row after row of rectangular metal containers are lined up ready to be transported to the UK.\n\nPolice are trying to establish when the group got inside and if smugglers found the container for them and then locked the door behind them.\n\nThe container was placed on a cargo ship on Tuesday, which then set sail around 2pm. The choppy Channel crossing took around ten hours before the ship docked at the Essex port of Purfleet on the Thames at 12.30am yesterday.\n\nRichard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said those inside would have frozen to death in horrendous conditions if the refrigeration had been switched on.", "description": "Sabir Zazai (pictured, left) said that every moment in the truck he came to the UK felt like his life was ending as he fled the Taliban dictatorship of Afghanistan.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/13/20130848-0-image-a-13_1571920200244.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
