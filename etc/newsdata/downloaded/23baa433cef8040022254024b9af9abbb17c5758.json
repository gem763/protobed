Turkish and Syrian troops could end up in close proximity as a result.\n\nTrump\u2019s withdrawal of all U.S. troops from northern Syria prompted fresh criticism from lawmakers, including fellow Republicans, who return to Washington today after a two-week break ready to pursue penalties against Turkey. Critics accuse Trump of selling out the Kurds and abdicating America\u2019s responsibilities in the region.\n\nHaving enabled Erdogan\u2019s initial move, Trump now says he\u2019s ready to impose \u201cpowerful\u201d sanctions if Turkey does anything in Syria the U.S. considers off-limits.\n\nPenalties though may not stop Erdogan, who has vowed to push the Kurds back from his border. That raises the chance of a broader clash as Assad\u2019s troops move toward the area. Yet Damascus, with its forces fatigued by an eight-year civil war, probably doesn\u2019t have the wherewithal to take on the Turks without Moscow\u2019s help.\n\nHow all this plays out depends largely on Turkey and Russia. Washington is now a bystander.\n\nGlobal Headlines\n\nJust In: Hold the champagne. China wants further talks as soon as the end of the month to hammer out the details of a \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal touted by Trump before President Xi Jinping agrees to sign it.\n\nPolitical posturing | Queen Elizabeth II will deliver Boris Johnson\u2019s legislative agenda today, yet, with no working majority in Parliament, the prime minister\u2019s proposed 22 bills stand little chance of becoming law. Instead, the speech is a way for Johnson\u2019s Conservatives to outline their election manifesto. It comes as his attempt to secure a Brexit deal ran into trouble after the European Union said talks were a long way from a breakthrough.\n\nRead about how Brexit will only speed up the decline of Brand Britannia and click here for a timeline of events to watch over the next two weeks as the Oct. 31 divorce deadline approaches.\n\nNeed for speed | If U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants to finish the impeachment inquiry into Trump before the heart of the 2020 election, she\u2019ll likely need to do it without help from federal courts, which could take months to resolve any fight over presidential stonewalling. Even though at least two State Department officials are testifying as part of Democrats\u2019 probe, the White House continues to block access to documents and prevent testimony from other witnesses.\n\nHappening today: Trump\u2019s former Russia adviser Fiona Hill is scheduled to testify behind closed doors before three House panels leading the impeachment inquiry. Read more about Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to step down from the board of a Chinese-backed private equity company. The son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has been at the center of discredited allegations by Trump related to his work on behalf of foreign companies.\n\nBudapest brooding | Hungarian opposition parties celebrated last night after winning local elections in the capital and other cities, loosening the political stranglehold of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has clashed with the European Union over democratic standards. But another vote in regional peer Poland served to remind them how tough it is to expand local victories to the national level. A year after the nationalist ruling Law & Justice party lost big in city votes, it trounced pro-European parties in yesterday\u2019s parliamentary election.\n\nJail time | Catalan separatists who tried to break away from Spain two years ago were given jail sentences of up to 13 years by the Supreme Court in Madrid in an unprecedented ruling that marks a watershed in relations with the troubled region. The convictions will inject an extra dose of rancor into the political system as Spain prepares for a fourth general election in as many years on Nov. 10.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want to receive this post in your inbox every day?\u00a0Sign up\u00a0for the\u00a0Balance of Power\u00a0newsletter, and follow Bloomberg Politics on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for more.President Donald Trump\u2019s desire to get the U.S. out of Middle East wars is creating a mess that could reverberate long after America", "authors": ["Karl Maier"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oZModbps32N0_xkwEBjq.Q--~B/aD0xNDY0O3c9MjIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/f870e7fbb2b44fbe253a73258fdf1781", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
