But the Lib Dems \u2013 and Tory rebel MPs \u2013 remain opposed.\n\nA Lib Dem source said: \u201cTheir total unwillingness to work with anyone else makes the Labour Party the biggest barrier to stopping no-deal.\u201d\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said both Labour and the Lib Dems \u201cneed to grow up\u201d and focus on securing an extension.\n\n\"A Plaid Cymru source added: \u201cIt\u2019s not about who but about how we stop a disastrous crash-out Brexit.\u201d\n\n(Image: Jeff J Mitchell)\n\nThe Mirror understands the 21 ex-Tory rebel MPs are reluctant to take over the order paper again to boost legal safeguards against no-deal.\n\nIt came as campaigners lost a bid to get a court order which would have forced the PM to obey the Benn Act and delay Brexit. Edinburgh\u2019s Court of Session ruled against it because judges believe he will obey the law.\n\nThe campaigners will launch an appeal today.\n\nDespite No10 saying \u201cwe will obey the law\u201d, a Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cWe are leaving on October 31. The manner in which this policy is lawfully achieved is a matter for the Government.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nCampaigner Jo Maugham QC said: \u201cWe see from briefings that come out of No 10 there is a very real risk he will not comply.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Britain\u2019s debt could rocket \u2013 with the Government piggybank groaning under the pressure of the PM\u2019s pre-election bribes and the potential cost of a no-deal Brexit, a report has warned.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Government will borrow \u00a350billion next year, leaving a pledge not to borrow more than 2% of national income in tatters.\n\nEven a \u201cbenign\u201d no-deal would likely lead to the Treasury borrowing \u00a3100billion, hiking debt as a percentage of national income to nearly 90% for the first time since the mid-1960s.\n\nA spokesman for the Treasury said: \u201cWe\u2019ll retain a fiscal anchor to public spending so decisions are taken with a view to the long-term sustainability.\u201d", "description": "Labour slam Prime Minister after he ruled out publishing the full 44-page document", "authors": ["Pippa Crerar", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Afp Getty Images", "Jeff J Mitchell", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20527082.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
