Racial themes still dominate. Harping on the otherworldliness of the black experience in America still wins laughs even as our neighborhoods and schools and workplaces become more diverse and integrated. Before Bill Cosby \u2019s monstrous offstage behavior caught up with him, his career offered evidence of a huge appetite for nonracial humor from a black comedian. But Mr. Cosby continues to be the exception. Two decades into the 21st century, much of black stand-up seems stuck in the 1980s. The jokes have been updated, but the nature of the humor hasn\u2019t really changed.\n\nMr. Chappelle and fellow black comedian Chris Rock are still the best at what they do, but Mr. Rock\u2019s work strikes me as more subversive. While others obsess over what white people are doing, many of Mr. Rock\u2019s most memorable routines zero in on black attitudes toward education, parenting and law enforcement. His sensibilities can be as shocking as his language, especially in a political environment where personal responsibility is pass\u00e9 and calling attention to counterproductive behavior is a no-no. Drug companies are to blame for the opioid crisis. The gun lobby is to blame for mass shootings. Racism is to blame for racial disparities.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jason Riley", "Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
