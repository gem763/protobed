Jack Keane in an interview with Breitbart News Wednesday.\n\n\u201cConducting military operations that are going to last for weeks over a pretty sizable piece of territory that we\u2019re talking about here in Northern Syria requires a significant amount of logistics preparations,\u201d said Keane.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s not only troops; you\u2019ve got to have all of the logistics to support that \u2014 and that means food, water, ammunition, fuel \u2014 all of that\u2019s got to be moved. And so it\u2019s serious when you see that kind of preparation being made,\u201d he added.\n\nAll those things would have shown the degree of seriousness of Turkey\u2019s intent to invade, Keane said.\n\n\u201cThey knew they were very serious about it, and it was probably a matter of time. We probably didn\u2019t know exactly what day, but we knew it was inevitable,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. officials said when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday, October 6, it was to notify him of the imminent invasion \u2014 not to ask for permission.\n\nThe U.S. decided to pull approximately 24 U.S. Army Special Forces from the area where Turkey was planning to invade \u2014 out of concern for their safety.\n\nKeane said there had been ongoing negotiations with the Turks to establish a safe zone in northern Syria \u2014 where the Turks were concerned about the presence of Syrian Kurdish forces, who they consider terrorists.\n\n\u201cBut Erdogan was frustrated because he didn\u2019t believe these negotiations, which were going on for months \u2026 [were] moving fast enough,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m convinced he probably had all the preparations to conduct the operation before he called the president, and it was more or less informing the president that he fully intended to conduct this military operation.\u201d\n\nThe White House announced the October 6 phone call and the president\u2019s decision to pull back American forces late Sunday evening:\n\nToday, President Donald J. Trump spoke with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey by telephone. Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria. The United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial \u201cCaliphate,\u201d will no longer be in the immediate area.\n\nSince that call, Democrats and Republicans have blamed Trump for \u201cgreenlighting\u201d Turkey\u2019s invasion into Syria by moving U.S. forces back. They argue that if Trump would not have moved the approximately 24 U.S. forces, that Turkey would not have invaded \u2014 despite the weeks-long preparations for the campaign.\n\nTrump administration officials argue there was no greenlight and that it was long in coming. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said at a briefing on October 11:\n\nNobody green-lighted this operation by Turkey \u2014 just the opposite. We pushed back very hard at all levels for the Turks not to commence this operation. But Lord knows they have opposed this relationship between the United States and the [Kurdish forces] since its infancy in 2014. The Turks have opposed it all along the way, and so we should not be surprised that they\u2019ve finally acted this way.\u201d\n\nEsper had also urged his Turkish counterpart not to go through with it during a phone call on October 3 \u2014 just four days before the operation began.\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark Milley also spoke to his counterpart that same day. A readout said the two discussed the \u201cimportance of U.S.-Turkish cooperation in the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite our protestations, despite the fact that we urged the Turks not to do this, they decided to do it and we told them that we would not support them militarily in this action,\u201d Esper told CBS News on Sunday.\n\nSome, like Keane, believe that Trump should have threatened using U.S. military force to prevent Turkey from moving in.\n\n\u201cI would have said to him \u2026 \u2018I think that\u2019s a huge mistake on your part \u2026 the United States and the coalition controls the airspace in Northeastern Syria, and we are not going to permit you to establish that safe zone by force. In other words, if you come across the border, we will retaliate,\u2019\u201d Keane said.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe the consequences of that would have been Erdogan is not going to have his fighters fight the United States fighters in the air, or have his militia force deal with the United States-led coalition on the ground, either \u2026 because it would have put at risk his ability to establish the safe zone that he wanted,\u201d he added.\n\nKeane said the U.S. would have had to have the conviction that it would retaliate in order to deter Erdogan. \u201cWe did not have that conviction, so therefore we did not have any deterrence. Quite the opposite, we moved our forces out of the way.\u201d\n\nSome experts disagree that Trump could have stopped Erdogan.\n\n\u201cI think Turkey would have gone in anyway,\u201d said the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Jim Carafano. \u201cAnd I think they would have gone in with the confidence that those American forces would have gotten out of the way. That even if the U.S. said, \u2018Well we\u2019re not moving our troops,\u2019 that the Turks already made the calculation that the Americans are not going to set up an Alamo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not foolish, they look at our interests, and go, \u2018Why would Americans fight over a buffer zone in Syria? I mean, that\u2019s ridiculous. If the Americans said, \u2018Well we\u2019re not moving,\u2019 I think they would have seen it as a bluff and gone in anyway,'\u201d he added.\n\nCarafano said the president could have done a better job explaining his decision to the American people and what the strategy going forward was \u2014 to stem the waves of criticism leveled at Trump in the days after the phone call for \u201cgreenlighting\u201d the operation, however.\n\n\u201cThis really calls for a serious speech, for the president to come out and do what he did when he gave the first Afghanistan speech, or when he was pulling out of the Iran deal, and say \u2018Look, this is how we got here, this is what\u2019s going on, this is what we\u2019re going to do to protect American interests in the future,'\u201d he said.\n\nBut some believe it came down to Trump\u2019s own core opposition to having U.S. troops running around in the Middle East engaged in costly wars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more about a 20-year thought that the president has always had about the Middle East,\u201d Keane said. \u201cHe\u2019s had this view for some time \u2026 his advisers have not dissuaded him from that.\u201d\n\nCarafano said there is only so much the U.S. can do in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThe notion that somehow the U.S. is the architect of this crisis is wrong and that the U.S. can somehow fix Syria is wrong and that the U.S. has anything other than very limited options on how to do this [is wrong],\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe only really care about two things: One is protecting our forces, the other is we need to continue to counter terrorism fight. The only way we\u2019re going to prevent things like mass refugees [is] by holding the parties accountable for what they do. We\u2019re not going to physically be able to go on the ground to do that,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019s @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "In the weeks leading up to the Turkish invasion of northern Syria, the military detected a variety of warning signs of a pending operation.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Erdogan1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
