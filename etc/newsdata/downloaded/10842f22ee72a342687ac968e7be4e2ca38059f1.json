But they only stayed five.\n\n\"I feel sad, hurt and very, very disappointed to see how we were treated,\" Vine said. \"Some people got in who didn't deserve it any more than I did.\"\n\nThe Tuckers raised five children on Little Bay Islands, in their yellow house with their shed on the wharf.\n\nThe island is only accessible by ferry, and the Tuckers opted to stay in St. John's while sea ice was packed in during May 2017. They had doctors appointments and said they couldn't risk missing them if the ferry wasn't running.\n\nMedical exemptions can be made under the provincial resettlement policy, but it has to be for \"ongoing health care treatment.\"\n\nThe Tuckers had a note from their doctor saying they had to stay close to St. John's for medical reasons \u2014 Vine has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney trouble and arthritis, while Edwin has cardiac problems that led to open heart surgery \u2014 but government ruled their conditions did not require \"ongoing health care treatment.\"\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned, we had to be dying,\" Vine said. \"We either had to be on chemo, or dialysis or whatever.\"\n\nAnd so after 80 years on Little Bay Islands \u2014 73 years of living there year round \u2014 the Tuckers packed up in September and left.\n\n\"It's hard to leave the place you lived your whole life,\" Edwin said. \"And then to have to just walk out with nothing, it's a bad, bad feeling.\"\n\nAppeal no good\n\nThey appealed the government's position, but a Supreme Court justice upheld the decision this month.\n\nIn his judgment dated Oct. 10, Justice Daniel Boone said it wasn't his job to overrule Municipal Affairs and Environment unless its decision was unreasonable.\n\n\"It may be that the interpretation offered by the applicants is also plausible,\" Boone wrote. \"However, it is not the role of this court on judicial review to choose between two plausible interpretations and substitute its opinion for that of the minister.\"\n\nThe last of the resettling residents are trickling out of Little Bay Islands as the winter draws closer. When January comes, the water and power will be shut off. The ferry won't stop by anymore.\n\nI told the truth and I guess that's why I got disqualified. - Vine Tucker\n\nWithout the $260,000 payment, the Tuckers say they won't see their town again. They could have used the money to turn their three-storey house into a summer cabin complete with a septic tank and generator.\n\n\"Now we can't go back,\" Edwin said. \"We've got no water or sewer. Nothing like that. We'd have to take a generator. That can't happen with us. We just had to pack up and move.\"\n\nThe couple said they know of other Little Bay Islands residents who were paid out despite not being residents at all.\n\nThey were required to keep a log book of nights they spent on the islands to prove they spent at least six months in the community over each of the last two years.\n\n\"A lot of lies was told by the people that got it, I'll tell you that right now,\" Edwin said.\n\n\"I told the truth and I guess that's why I got disqualified,\" Vine added.\n\nEdwin and Vine Tucker have lived on Little Bay Islands their whole lives. Now they're being told they don't qualify for resettlement money, unlike many of their friends and neighbours. (Ryan Cooke/CBC)\n\nThe Tuckers can take the case to the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador. Their son, Dwight, has been funding their case with a lawyer from Stack and Associates.\n\nAccording to the family, their lawyer believes they might have a chance on appeal, however it's unlikely they'll pay more money in legal fees to pursue the issue further.\n\nVine said it leaves her feeling like her 80 years spent living in Little Bay Islands didn't make her enough of a resident.\n\n\"I left out there in September and I couldn't even look back,\" she said with tears in her eyes. \"I just looked ahead of me. It broke my heart.\"\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "description": "The couple has a doctor's note saying they needed to be in St. John's last winter, but it didn't matter to the provincial government.", "authors": ["Ryan Cooke Works For Cbc Out Of Its Bureau In St. John'S.", "Read More Articles This Author"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5320594.1571076462!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/little-bay-islands-tuckers.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
