As Melania Trump\u2019s communications director, she authored in December 2018 a roughly 1,300-word entry published on CNN.com rebutting an opinion piece by network contributor Kate Andersen Brower, who offered a negative assessment of the first lady.\n\nOn Friday, Grisham continued her line of attack against the Post, complaining on Twitter that the paper did not cover \u201cthe president\u2019s directive to ease all federal student loan debt for disabled veterans,\u201d nor did it write about \u201cthe first time in history a sitting United States president walked across the DMZ into North Korea.\u201d\n\nJournalists promptly clarified online that the Post did, in fact, report on both episodes , with several reporters calling out Grisham for her false posts.\n\nGrisham was similarly ridiculed by some of the president\u2019s critics after she chastised CNN on Thursday for an on-air graphic mislabeling the state of Alabama as Mississippi.\n\nHer tweet scolding the network elicited a retort from CNN\u2019s communication\u2019s team, and came as Trump dug in on his refusal to acknowledge he erred in predicting Alabama would \u201cmost likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d by Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThe broadsides from Grisham against major media outlets, paired with her reluctance to advocate on-air on behalf of the administration, represent a departure from her predecessors\u2019 approach to the role of press secretary.\n\nThough Sean Spicer gained quick notoriety for his combative interactions with the White House press corps, he presided over televised briefings, and his interpretation of the position aligned most closely with those of previous presidential spokespeople.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders tapered off and eventually oversaw the elimination of the White House\u2019s daily briefings, but emerged as a more dogmatic champion of the administration's agenda \u2014 bludgeoning Trump\u2019s detractors and maintaining a consistent presence on cable news. She made her first appearance as a Fox News contributor on Friday.", "description": "The White House press secretary has leveled her most biting critiques of the media off-camera, digitally defending the president.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d1/8a/350e136c46da99fe46f5cc31fc1d/20190906-grisham-defender-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
