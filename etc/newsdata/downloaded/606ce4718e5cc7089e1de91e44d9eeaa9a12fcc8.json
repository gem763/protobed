No single substance has been shown to cause the illness, but several marijuana products have been identified as possible culprits. It had not been determined by Tuesday what substance was responsible in the Bronx death, a state health official said.\n\nDr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the C.D.C., said at a news briefing last week that the outbreak in vaping-related illnesses was \u201ccontinuing at a brisk pace.\u201d She emphasized that the illnesses were serious and life-threatening and called the proportion of patients hospitalized and in intensive care \u201cjust terrible.\u201d\n\nAbout 70 percent of the patients were male, 80 percent were under 35 and 16 percent were younger than 18, she said. The median age for those who died was about 50 .\n\nSeveral states, including New York, have responded to the outbreak, and to the increasing rate of teenage vaping, with efforts to ban flavored e-cigarette pods that are especially popular with children. The Trump administration said last month that it was considering a federal ban on flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nLast week, a state appeals court blocked the New York ban on the flavored pods just before it was to take effect. Vaping groups had sued to stop the ban, arguing that it would hurt retailers and adults who use the products to quit smoking tobacco. The vaping industry is also battling a more extensive ban of all vaping products in Massachusetts, which recently reported its first vaping-related death.\n\nThe disclosure of the Bronx teenager\u2019s vaping-related death came as New York City filed a federal lawsuit against 22 websites it claims targeted and sold e-cigarette products to people under 21, the minimum legal age to buy tobacco and e-cigarette products in New York.", "description": "The 17-year-old who died last week is the youngest of 23 people to die nationwide of a vaping-related lung illness.", "authors": ["Ed Shanahan", "Azi Paybarah"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/nyregion/09vapingdeath-print/08vapingdeath1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
