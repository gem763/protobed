The CNN host compared the president\u2019s language to that of Ms. Rice\u2019s former boss, President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cThe way [Mr. Bush] talked about Islam after 9/11 was so thoughtful in trying to not demean Islam as a religion,\u201d Mr. Zakaria said. \u201cWhen you hear Trump, this is the repudiation of everything you and Bush were trying to do.\u201d\n\nMs. Rice responded, \u201cLook, the president needs to be a lot more careful in the way he speaks about these things because race is a very delicate and raw nerve in America. We have a birth defect of slavery, we have a birth defect of a number of people being treated badly, so you have to be careful.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you, Fareed, it\u2019s not all coming out of the White House,\u201d she continued. \u201cI hear a lot coming out of the left on these issues, too, that I don\u2019t like the language that is used about people \u2014 the notion that because somebody looks a certain way or is of a certain color, they ought to think a certain way, and if they don\u2019t think a certain way, then they\u2019re really not black.\u201d\n\nMs. Rice cited the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d and stated that everyone would be \u201cbetter off\u201d if they treated each other with respect.\n\n\u201cI think this is a national project, not a White House project,\u201d she said. \u201cI have said and I think everybody understands that I don\u2019t like a lot of the language that this president uses. I especially don\u2019t like the language about immigrants, because in so many ways immigrants are an easy target. But the reason that I emphasize all of our responsibilities is if we just point fingers at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, we\u2019re not going to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
