The 44 year-old mother of four replaces Charles Michel who will start preparing for his new role as EU Council President. Like him, she stems from the French-speaking Liberal party MR and she now inherits the poisoned chalice of trying to help form a government among linguistically divided parties.\n\nThe new appointment means that now 4 women in the EU hold the position of head of state.\n\nAngela Merkel is the Chancellor of Germany.\n\nBrigitte Bierlein is the Chancellor of Austria.\n\nMette Frederiksen is the Prime Minister of Denmark.\n\nFor the European Women's Lobby, more women need to be in positions of power in the EU.\n\n\"We have this real, concrete improvement but it is not good enough, because we still don't have parity. Men are still widely over-represented in politics, in the EU and it is an issue of democracy and even when women are represented they are not represented in their full diversity,\" Manon Deshayes, policy and campaign assistant tells our reporter.\n\nUntil recently, the first female president of the European Commission Ursula Von der Leyen strived to have a gender balanced Commission. Initially she announed 14 of the 27 Commissioners would be female.\n\nBut the rejection of 2 women proposed Commissioners by the European Parliament destroyed this balance -the new proposals are both men.\n\nAnd also in EU news...\n\nThe European Union's first-ever foreign affairs chief, Catherine Ashton, is becoming a lobbyist, five years after leaving office.\n\nShe recently took a job with private security firm GardaWorld, which bids for EU contracts, the EU Observer reported.\n\nAshton is also the head of the Global Europe program at the Wilson Center, a liberal Washington-based think tank.\n\nNew Commission update:\n\nIncoming EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has renewed efforts to complete her team.\n\nOn Monday she was scheduled to meet the new candidates from France and Hungary, Thierry Breton and Oliver Varhelyi.\n\nTheir respective countries' first choices were rejected by the European Parliament, which is delaying the start of the new Commission until December.", "description": "As Belgium gets its first female prime minister, we take a look at how many EU countries have female leaders (clue you can count on one hand).", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/28/28/1000x563_cmsv2_352867ab-461f-5643-9c9a-ba58d517732a-4262828.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
