That we're not doing enough on climate change,\" he said.\n\n\"Australia is doing more than any other country. I defy anyone here to think of another country that does more on climate change in the Pacific.\n\n\"We're spending more than any other government has in Australian history to make sure we achieve this.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Hawke also brushed off criticism that the government had not injected more money into the United Nations' green climate fund, saying that money was better spent in bilateral arrangements.\n\n\"We know through our agencies we can deliver a better outcome for Pacific partners directly. We can do more with that money on the ground in a faster way,\" he said.\n\nAs foreshadowed, opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong used her speech to the conference to attack Mr Morrison for his \"reckless\" handling of foreign policy, particularly the relationship with China, for short-term political gain.\n\nFollowing her speech, Senator Wong said it would be untrue, and a disservice to the public, to suggest that Labor risked being defined as the pro-China party, and the Coalition the anti-China party.\n\n\"What the government is doing is lurching from one press conference to another around a series of unplanned domestic political tactics when it comes to the China relationship in foreign policy,\" she said.\n\nSenator Wong said Mr Morrison's recent speech to the Lowy Institute where he warned against \"negative globalism\" highlighted his inconsistent handling of foreign affairs.\n\n\"Scott Morrison bowls up, wants \u2013 for domestic political purposes \u2013 to rail against globalism but he\u2019s free trade,\" she said.\n\n\"He\u2019s pro-free trade. Well you can\u2019t be pro free-trade and rail against globalism.\"", "description": "International Development Minister Alex Hawke says the government needs to do a better job selling its efforts on tackling climate change in the Pacific", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3472%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_351%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6fe261c9fb9462d18359e1c7267eb428172ad575", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
