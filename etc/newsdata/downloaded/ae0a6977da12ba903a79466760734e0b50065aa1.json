We promised them the truth. We owe them the truth.\n\nGrenfell Tower covered with hoardings following a severe fire in June 2017 (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018And, today, the whole country, the whole world, is finally hearing the truth about what happened at Grenfell Tower on the 14th of June 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018For the survivors, the bereaved, and the local community, this report will prove particularly harrowing.\n\n\u2018Yet I hope it strengthens their faith in the inquiry\u2019s desire to determine the facts of the fire \u2013 and in this government\u2019s commitment to airing those facts in public, no matter how difficult they may be, and acting on them.\n\n\u2018That commitment is absolute.\u2019\n\nThe report concludes that \u2018serious shortcomings\u2019 not plagued the fire service\u2019s response.\n\nIt also accuses London Fire Brigade (LFB) commissioner Dany Cotton of \u2018remarkable insensitivity\u2019 after she said she would not have done anything differently on the night.\n\nMore details will emerge on Wednesday on recommendations made by inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick following the two-year investigation into how the disaster at the west London tower block unfolded.\n\nFirefighters at the scene of the fire (Picture: Getty)\n\nBut General Secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, Matt Wrack, told the BBC the ordering of the inquiry was \u2018completely back-to-front\u2019 \u2013 a concern which has previously been voiced by the local community.\n\nCampaign group Justice 4 Grenfell said firefighters \u2018have been made scapegoats of Phase 1 while the \u2018big\u2019 players seem to have got off scot-free\u2019.\n\nThe group will parade billboards around Kensington and Westminster after the report is made public to highlight the fact that recommendations need the political will of the government to be implemented.\n\nThey said: \u2018The film that we are using again as inspiration, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, highlights the power of advertising to bring about justice.\n\n\u2018We wanted to harness this power to remind people to pay attention to the report and to highlight that the government ignored the recommendations after the fire at Lakanal House in 2009.\n\nLondon fire commissioner Dany Cotton was criticised for \u2018insensitivity\u2019 (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018Also there is nothing on the statute books for recommendations of any public inquiry to be implemented, by a government.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Labour MP for Kensington, Emma Dent Coad, has invited those directly affected to meet her in Parliament on Wednesday evening to hear any concerns and responses they may have about the report.\n\nIn his report, Sir Martin said the \u2018principal reason\u2019 the flames shot up the building at such speed was the combustible aluminium composite material cladding with polyethylene cores which acted as a \u2018source of fuel\u2019.\n\nThe report also concluded the fire, in which 72 people died, started as the result of an \u2018electrical fault in a large fridge-freezer\u2019 in a fourth floor flat.\n\nThe judge said he had not intended to investigate whether the building complied with regulations at this stage, but there was already \u2018compelling evidence\u2019 the external walls did not.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
