All preparations for the operation have been completed,\u201d the Turkish Defence Ministry said on Twitter early on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt is essential to establish a safe zone/peace corridor to contribute to our region\u2019s peace and stability, and for Syrians to achieve a safe life.\u201d\n\nA Reuters witness saw no sign of military activity near the Turkish border town of Akcakale, across from Syria\u2019s Tel Abyad. Howitzers were placed behind earth embankments on Turkey\u2019s side of the border, pointed towards Syria.\n\nSome 60 km (37 miles) to the west, multiple launch rocket systems mounted on two trucks were deployed behind earth embankments near Suruc, opposite the Syrian border town of Kobani. Artillery was also stationed in the area, and soldiers wandered around a nearby military camp.\n\nU.S. forces evacuated two observation posts at Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain on Monday, a U.S. official said.\n\nTrump\u2019s warning on Turkey\u2019s economy appeared aimed at placating critics who accused him of abandoning the Syrian Kurds by pulling out U.S. forces. The decision drew criticism from Democrats and a rebuke from some of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n\u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!)\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cRED FLAG\u201d\n\nHis remarks met an angry response in Turkey, including from opposition party politicians such as Iyi Party leader Meral Aksener who said it was a day to put aside domestic politics.\n\n\u201cThreatening Turkey\u2019s economy is a diplomatic catastrophe,\u201d she told her party\u2019s lawmakers in a speech in parliament. \u201cThe best response to this insolence is to go into the east of the Euphrates and break the terror corridor.\u201d\n\nThe Kurdish-led forces, who have been the most effective U.S. partners in fighting Islamic State in Syria, have denounced the major U.S. policy shift as \u201cstab in the back\u201d.\n\nMustafa Bali of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the continued Turkish military buildup on the border, together with information about further mobilisation of Turkey-backed Syrian rebels, indicated that \u201can attack is imminent\u201d.\n\n\u201cNaturally our preparations are along the length of the border with Turkey and our forces are in a state of readiness,\u201d Bali told Reuters.\n\nSyrian Kurdish official Badran Jia Kurd said Kurdish-led authorities in northern Syria may open talks with Damascus and Russia U.S. forces fully withdrew from the Turkish border area.\n\nHis comments reflect the predicament of Kurdish-led forces in northern Syria after the partial withdrawal of U.S. troops who have effectively shielded the area from Turkish attack.\n\n\u201cAt that time we may hold talks with Damascus or the Russian side to fill the void or block the Turkish attack, so this may develop and there could be meetings and contacts in case of a vacuum,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nThe United States expects Turkey to take responsibility for captive Islamic State fighters in northeastern Syria if Ankara\u2019s planned incursion seizes areas where the detained militants are held, a senior State Department official said.\n\nThe captives are held in SDF facilities south of a safe zone initially proposed by Turkey.\n\nTurkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said overnight it was Turkey\u2019s fundamental right to take necessary measures for its national security against terrorism threats from Syria.\n\n\u201cTurkey is determined to clear terrorists from the east of the Euphrates and protect its own security and survival while implementing a secure zone in order to achieve peace and stability,\u201d Aksoy said in a written statement.\n\nRussia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s strongest foreign ally, said it was not told in advance by Washington or Turkey about any agreements to pull U.S. troops from the northeast, adding it was watching the situation very closely.\n\nIran, another Assad ally, voiced opposition to any Turkish operation in Syria. \u201cSuch an action will not only not end Turkey\u2019s security concerns but will lead to widespread material and human damage,\u201d Iran\u2019s foreign ministry said.\n\nGermany and Britain expressed concern about Turkey\u2019s plans for military action. German government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer said a military intervention would \u201chave fatal security, political and humanitarian consequences\u201d.\n\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey plans to resettle two million refugees in northern Syria and Turkish media has said the draft resettlement plan involves a 151 billion lira ($26 billion) construction project. Turkey hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks about the House impeachment investigation during a formal signing ceremony for the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement at the White House in Washington, October 7, 2019.
