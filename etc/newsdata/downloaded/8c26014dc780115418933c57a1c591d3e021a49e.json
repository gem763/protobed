Spencer arrived at England\u2019s hotel in Tokyo on Monday and immediately set about getting up to speed, having replaced the injured Willi Heinz in the squad.\n\nHeinz was ruled out of the final with a hamstring injury sustained in the closing stages of Saturday\u2019s semi-final victory over New Zealand. Eddie Jones revealed Heinz was in tears in the dressing room and that the Gloucester scrum-half will remain with the squad and lend his support to Spencer.\n\nJones admitted he took a risk when selecting only two scrum-halves in his squad in August and as a result, Spencer is almost certain to be on the bench against the Springboks to provide back-up for Ben Youngs.\n\nEngland were perfect in their semi-final but expect Eddie Jones to tinker | Nick Evans Read more\n\nJones moved quickly to get the 27-year-old, who had been due to start for Saracens against Leicester, on a flight to Japan, but he has only three caps as a replacement to his name \u2013 the most recent in March \u2013 and has never tasted victory with England. He was part of England\u2019s wider training squad over the summer and did go on last year\u2019s tour of South Africa, winning his first and second caps in the defeats in Johannesburg and Bloemfontein.\n\nHe does not have long to acclimatise before Saturday\u2019s final in Yokohama but Jones has repeatedly mentioned the former All Black Stephen Donald, who was seconded at short notice to New Zealand\u2019s 2011 squad and kicked the decisive penalty in the final against France.\n\nSpencer was reminded of that Cinderella story after arriving in Japan. Donald was memorably fishing when he got the call from Graham Henry, then New Zealand coach, to answer an injury crisis at fly-half. He was an unused replacement in the semi-final but when Aaron Cruden became the third New Zealand fly-half to suffer an injury, Donald, barely able to fit into his jersey, came on in the 34th minute and kicked his side\u2019s only penalty in the 8-7 win that sealed the All Blacks\u2019 first World Cup crown in 24 years.\n\n\u201cBen will have a shirt that fits him, so that\u2019s one significant difference,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd he hasn\u2019t been fishing, so that\u2019s another difference! It\u2019s a great opportunity for the kid, he\u2019s excited about it. He\u2019s been around the team. I was just talking about how he played South Africa in June in 2018 Ben was part of that squad, it\u2019s an opportunity for him to come in and do his job.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\n\u201cIt is just a great opportunity ahead of him. He has come into the squad and has got to learn a few new things. Willi will help him and Benny will help him with that. He has just got to learn a little bit more in the early part of the week and get himself physically and mentally ready.\u201d\n\nJones also paid tribute to Heinz, who emerged as a late contender for England\u2019s World Cup squad towards the end of the season, leapfrogging Danny Care, Dan Robson and Spencer in the pecking order. \u201cThe great thing is Willi wanted to stay and we wanted him to stay, so it wasn\u2019t a hard discussion,\u201d the coach said. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you want to get married. If the lady wants to marry you and you offer to marry, it\u2019s a pretty easy conversation. He\u2019s just a great bloke. Even now he\u2019s already started to mentor Ben Spencer.\u201d", "description": "England were confident Ben Spencer can handle the pressure should he make his World Cup debut in the final against South Africa", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77680d94d642aed0d0887bbaa81dd8f2ee693412/682_455_3491_2095/master/3491.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4a608788d849277faaf05b749dda721d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
