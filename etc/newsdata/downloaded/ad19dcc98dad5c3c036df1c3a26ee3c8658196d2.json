Get tins of your fave Quality Street at B&M for \u00a34.99", "language": "en", "text": "No more fighting for your favourites (Picture: Quality Street)\n\nWe announced recently that John Lewis had brought back their much-loved pick-your-own Quality Street tins, for picky fans of the Christmas delicacies.\n\nFor \u00a312, customers could go all in on their Quality Street choices, even opting for a tin with only one kind in if they so wished.\n\nFor those of you who aren\u2019t able to get to John Lewis, though, it\u2019s kind of a bummer.\n\nInstead of having to go back to picking your Green Triangles out and keeping them in a secret hiding place, though, you can opt for this tub from B&M.\n\nA savvy shopper on the UK Extreme Couponing and Bargains group on Facebook noticed that the discount retailer is selling tins of Strawberry Delights Quality Street for just \u00a34.99.\n\nThe tub is packaged up to look like a big giant sweet, and holds 385g of the treats.\n\nIf you can\u2019t make it to the John Lewis pick-and-mix stations (Picture: Ray Tang/REX )\n\nFor those who prefer The Purple One, tins of these are also available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, that although this seems lik a total bargain compared to the John Lewis tins, you do actually get less for your money. The \u00a312 tins are 1.2kg while you\u2019d need to buy more than three of these to break even.\n\nThey\u2019ll certainly do the trick if you can\u2019t make it to the bigger stores, though.\n\nFacebookers are clearly loving them. One commenter on a post said: \u2018That is Christmas dinner right there!\u2019\n\nThere were also plenty more who tagged in their significant others, so if you want a good idea for a stocking filler, don\u2019t say we aren\u2019t good to you.\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough time for sweetie lovers, after the Toffee Deluxe was discontinued earlier this year, and it was revealed that tubs are getting smaller by the year.\n\nHopefully these wee beauties will go some way to consoling you all.\n\nMORE: Changing your diet can lift your mood in less than a month\n\nMORE: Straight women have \u2018more orgasms\u2019 if they\u2019re feminists\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Get these tins of Strawberry Delight or The Purple One sweets at B&M from now until the run-up to Christmas.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89265286_1570721301.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
