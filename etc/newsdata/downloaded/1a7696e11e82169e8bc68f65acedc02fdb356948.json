For instance, when the student told Vlaming he wanted to be called by a different name, Vlaming allowed his entire class to choose new French names for the semester, so as not to draw undue attention to the student.\n\nVlaming said he also avoided referring to the student by female pronouns while the student was present.\n\nThough this strategy seemed to work well for the first few weeks of school, in late October the student confronted Vlaming and said he heard from others that Vlaming was still referring to him by female pronouns behind his back.", "description": "A teacher alleged that the school tried to force him to \"express an objective biological falsehood\" by urging him to use the student's male pronouns.", "authors": ["Michelle Mark"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/srBsdis.27vQz4Mb40H3_g--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/5a7970147a033f8a3ad33688ce1e2d82"}
