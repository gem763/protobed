It was set up in 2016, following the murder of the MP Jo Cox.\n\nIts data shows in the year ending August 2017, MPs reported 111 crimes targeting them.\n\nThis increased to 242 the following year.\n\nBetween September 2018 and July 22nd 2019, there have been 238.\n\nIt is likely growing awareness of this body has contributed to these rises.\n\nThe Met has previously said just 10 MPs have accounted for 29% of the crime reports.\n\nIt also said a disproportionate number of those being targeted were women or from ethnic minorities.\n\nLiberal Democrat MP Luciana Berger said six people had already been convicted for targeting her.\n\nPrevious data released by the Met Police suggests most of these crimes involve harassment, malicious communications, criminal damage or theft.\n\nNumber of crimes reported by MPs Crimes reported to Parliamentary Liaison and Investigation Team\n\nSpeaking to a select committee in May, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said Brexit divisions were linked to the rise.\n\n\"Brexit has been a huge driver of some of this, post-referendum,\" he said.\n\n\"We see a relatively even split between people who have been targeted because they are pro\u2011Brexit and people who have been targeted because they are pro\u2011Remain.\"\n\nHe added the reported crimes had been increasing in the first part of this year.\n\nWhat protections are in place?\n\nThe Metropolitan Police chief, Cressida Dick, has said on an average day, about 60 officers are \"engaged in nothing but thinking about the protests in the immediate environment of Parliament\".\n\nAnd in the past, it has been recommended that \"on occasion\" MPs take taxis when leaving the parliamentary estate.\n\nThe Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority also offers security packages, which allow them to purchase security items such as CCTV for their offices or personal alarms.\n\nAn Institute for Government report shows between 2016 and 2018, spending on security for individual MPs increased from \u00a3171,000 to over \u00a34m.\n\nThe government says plans are in place to make it an electoral offence to intimidate candidates and campaigners in the run up to an election.\n\nAdditionally, addresses of candidates standing in local or mayoral elections have been removed from ballot papers.\n\nWhat about language?\n\nIt's been suggested by a number of MPs in the Commons \"inflammatory language\" could lead to threats and violence.\n\nJess Phillips, for example, told of a death threat that directly quoted the words of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nPaula Sherriff, meanwhile, said many MPs were \"subject to death threats and abuse every single day\" and they often quoted words including \"surrender act, betrayal, traitor\".\n\nMr Johnson used the term \"surrender act\" 15 times during Wednesday's debate.\n\nAnd on Thursday, Labour's Harriet Harman said guidance on what constituted \"unparliamentary language\" was outdated.\n\nParliament's website lists examples of words that might be considered offensive, including \"stoolpigeon\", \"blackguard\", \"coward\", \"git\", \"guttersnipe\", \"hooligan\" and \"rat\".\n\nIt is largely at the discretion of the Speaker to decide when something meets this bar - John Bercow has recently objected to various \"unparliamentary\" words, including \"idiot\" and \"bastards\".\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "description": "Amid concern about a \"toxic\" atmosphere in Westminster, BBC Reality Check looks at the level of threats MPs face.", "authors": ["Reality Check Team", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D80C/production/_108980355_gettyimages-696549934.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
