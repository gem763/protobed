Terrill)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Austin Meadows homered leading off the 11th inning, sending Tampa Bay to an 8-7 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers that helped the Rays keep pace in the AL wild-card race and prevented the New York Yankees from clinching the AL East title Wednesday night.\n\nTampa Bay remained two games behind Oakland for the top wild card and a half-game ahead of Cleveland for the second spot.\n\nMeadows slugged his 32nd homer off Josh Sborz (0-1), and Ji-Man Choi's sacrifice fly tacked on an insurance run after the Rays had rallied for two runs off closer Kenley Jansen in the ninth.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nTommy Pham had a career-high five hits for the Rays, who ended a two-game skid.\n\nTampa Bay took advantage of another collapse by Jansen, who had shown improvement lately. Jansen got booed off the field after giving up Choi's RBI single and Travis d'Arnaud's sacrifice fly that tied it 6-all.\n\nThe teams combined to use 18 pitchers, two more than on Tuesday.\n\nThe Dodgers closed to 8-7 in the 11th on Edwin Rios' RBI single with two outs off Pete Fairbanks. But with runners on first and second, pinch-hitter Russell Martin struck out swinging.\n\nColin Poche (5-5) got the win. Fairbanks earned his second save.\n\nCody Bellinger slugged his 45th homer in the eighth, ending the Dodgers' three-game skid without a home run. It hit the right field foul pole and extended the lead to 6-4.\n\nThe Dodgers led 5-4 in the sixth after pinch-hitter Joc Pederson singled in the tying run and Chris Taylor scored the go-ahead run on a passed ball by d'Arnaud that scooted off to his left.\n\nDustin May, the Dodgers' seventh pitcher, put the potential tying and go-ahead runs on in the seventh with consecutive hits by Pham and Nate Lowe. But then May struck out Choi and d'Arnaud, and retired Joey Wendle to end the threat.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the eighth, May again allowed the potential tying run aboard on a leadoff single to Avisail Garcia, who was thrown out by catcher Will Smith trying to steal second.\n\nThe Dodgers led 2-1 on Max Muncy's two-run double in the second.\n\nThe Rays tied it 3-all in the fifth on Pham's two-run double and took a 4-3 lead in the sixth on pinch-hitter Jesus Aguilar's RBI single, with Willy Adames scoring on Bellinger's throwing error in center field.\n\nLATE SWITCH\n\nFor the second straight game, the Dodgers made a late change to their starting pitcher. RHP Casey Sadler got the nod instead of RHP Tony Gonsolin. Sadler tossed two-thirds of an inning. Gonsolin worked in relief, which is what he'll do in the postseason if he makes the roster, so the team wants to use him in that role down the stretch. The same thing happened Tuesday when Caleb Ferguson replaced scheduled starter Ross Stripling, who pitched in relief, also his likely postseason role.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nDodgers: LHP Rich Hill (left knee strain) will throw to hitters Friday and start Tuesday at San Diego. ... 3B Justin Turner is recovering from a sprained left ankle, but no return date has been set. ''When he does come back, I want to be confident he can sustain it,'' manager Dave Roberts said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRays: After an off day, RHP Charlie Morton (15-6, 3.16 ERA) goes for his career-high 16th victory Friday against Boston.\n\nDodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (14-5, 3.05) pitches Friday at home against Colorado. He is 22-8 with a 3.41 ERA in 41 career starts versus the Rockies.\n\n---\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports", "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Austin Meadows homered leading off the 11th inning, sending Tampa Bay to an 8-7 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers that helped the Rays keep pace in the AL wild-card race and prevented the New York Yankees from clinching the AL East title Wednesday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jM199Q7pcEcjp3YiAy7cOw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwMjQ7aD02ODI-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zztVLAqec32GRMoWVwBsQA--~B/aD0zNDE7dz01MTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/Sports/ap/201909190005003292077", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
