Elizabeth Warren to attacks on the specific questions asked by moderators.\n\nThe Hill media reporter Joe Concha told Fox News that CNN\u2019s debate enhanced its already not-so-respectable reputation.\n\nTULSI GABBARD SLAMS CNN, NEW YORK TIMES DURING DEBATE FOR 'DESPICABLE' 'SMEARS' OVER SYRIA, RUSSIA\n\n\u201cThe network is under heavy criticism from the left and right today, and rightly so,\u201d Concha said. \u201cIts pursuit of sizzle over steak and focus on social issues over truly substantiate matters \u2013 economy, jobs, opioid crisis, border crisis, all-things China \u2013 has damaged the network's credibility even further.\u201d\n\nCNN partnered up with The New York Times for the event, which was moderated by CNN's Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and Gray Lady editor Marc Lacey. While viewers complained about several issues with the moderators, a question Cooper asked about Ellen DeGeneres and former President George W. Bush\u2019s friendship was perhaps the most lampooned.\n\n\u201cThree hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration,\u201d Julian Castro tweeted. \u201cClimate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border. But you know, Ellen.\u201d\n\nCNN FACES MORE ACCUSATIONS OF POLITICAL BIAS AHEAD OF DEMOCRATIC DEBATE\n\nSen. Kamala Harris also took to Twitter to criticize the moderators, noting there weren\u2019t questions about climate change, LGBTQ rights or immigration.\n\n\u201cThese issues are too important to ignore,\u201d Harris wrote.\n\nWhile Castro and Harris used social media, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hi., slammed CNN and The Times directly from the debate stage over what she described as \"smears\" against her on foreign policy.\n\n\"The New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,\" Gabbard said. \"Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia -- completely despicable.\"\n\nCNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER\n\nDePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall said the major flaw was that moderators allowed Sen. Elizabeth Warren to dominate the proceedings.\n\n\u201cThe time imbalance was so obvious and quite unfair to Gabbard, Castro and the others. That Warren is now or at the top of recent polls is no excuse for allowing such an imbalance,\u201d McCall told Fox News. \u201cA candidate forum is supposed to give all candidates a fair opportunity to engage the dialogue and that absolutely did not happen. The debate moderators apparently don't own stopwatches.\u201d\n\nMcCall said the imbalance \u201clends credence to the critics who say these forums are all about promoting some candidates over others\u201d and Warren was clearly the favorite.\n\nCNN, NYT SLAMMED FOR AVOIDING CHINA DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'THIS IS LITERALLY A JOKE,' 'SHAMEFUL'\n\n\u201cThe moderators were also quite powerless at times when they tried to move on or determine who would speak next. Candidates tended to ignore the moderators\u2019 directions and interrupt as they wanted,\u201d McCall said, adding that talking over the moderators is nothing new.\n\n\u201cThis is standard procedure now in these televised spectacles, but it remains a weakness in the format and relegates moderators to bystanders at times,\u201d he said.\n\nThe debate came hours after a secretly recorded video appeared to show a CNN staffer saying the network likes Warren \u201ca lot\u201d and dislikes Gabbard. CNN\u2019s own Twitter account even pointed out that Gabbard received less time than other candidates. According to CNN itself, Warren spoke for over 22 minutes, followed by Biden\u2019s 16-plus minutes, while Gabbard only spoke for roughly eight minutes.\n\nFollowing the debate, Gabbard\u2019s sister criticized CNN via a tweet sent by the candidate\u2019s verified account that accused the network of cutting off Gabbard to \u201cprotect Warren.\u201d\n\nPROJECT VERITAS\u2019 ALLEGED CNN WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS NETWORK IS \u2018PUMPING OUT PROPAGANDA'\n\n\u201cIt was no surprise that CNN began with almost 20 minutes talking about impeachment and defending the Bidens seeing as how CNN's been obsessed with impeachment for at least three years now,\u201d NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News.\n\n\u201cBetween cutting off Tulsi Gabbard and asking far-left, leading questions on abortion, gun control, and the Supreme Court, CNN reminded America last night just how invested they are in defeating and removing the President from office,\u201d Houck added.\n\nConservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News that the debate was harmful to candidates because liberal moderators were so easy on them.\n\n\u201cCNN is actually doing a disservice to the Democratic candidates and to Democratic voters by refusing to ask tough questions of the front runners,\u201d Barron said. \u201cWhoever the Democrats nominate will have to square off against President Trump on the debate stage and I promise you he won\u2019t treat the nominee with kid gloves\u201d\n\nMedia Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News that CNN wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cneutral referee\u201d because of its own bias and that was before the debate even started -- and the moderators didn\u2019t do anything to change his mind.\n\nDAN GAINOR: ELIZABETH WARREN DRAWS MOST ATTENTION FROM MEDIA AND CANDIDATES IN DEMOCRATIC DEBATE\n\n\u201cCNN, which has done as much as any outlet in America to promote impeachment, began the entire debate with 12 questions on the subject \u2013 one easy one for each candidate,\u201d Gainor wrote following the debate.\n\nCNN and The Times were also heavily criticized for overlooking China, which has been a focal point of the recent news cycle. China made headlines in recent weeks between its trade war with the United States and the growing tensions between the communist nation and the NBA \u2013 but the moderators didn\u2019t seem to care what 2020 candidates thought about the situation.\n\n\"There hasn\u2019t been one question about China in this entire 3 hour debate. It is shameful,\" \"The View\" co-host Meghan McCain tweeted.\n\nThe \"foreign policy\" portion of the debate featured questions predominately about Trump's recent troop withdrawal from Syria as well as handling Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIt's patently amazing that the network couldn't find the time over three hours to ask one question about arguably a Top-3 topic going into the 2020 election, China, but did ask as its final question of the night about the friendship between Ellen DeGeneres and George W. Bush,\u201d Concha said.\n\nPlenty of others took to Twitter to chime in on the debate, too:\n\nFox News\u2019 Joseph A.
