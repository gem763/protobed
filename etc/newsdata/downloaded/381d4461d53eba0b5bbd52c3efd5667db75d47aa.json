(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For nine months, the Pentagon played down the presence of its 1,000 troops in Syria, hoping that President Donald Trump would not focus on the extent to which the U.S. military was continuing to fight the Islamic State despite his order in December to pull out.\n\nOn Sunday, the president appeared to say he had had enough.\n\nNow, for the second time in less than a year, the Defense Department, the State Department, Congress and staff across the national security establishment are scrambling to respond to the words of a president who views Syria and the fight against the Islamic State as a battle largely won and done for U.S. troops. On Monday, after a White House announcement the night before that Trump was moving troops out of the way of a threatened Turkish incursion into Syria, Defense Department officials were struggling to put their already piecemeal Syria military strategy back together again.\n\nIt will not be easy. Caught between furious Kurdish allies who see Trump\u2019s announcement as abandonment, an authoritarian Turkish leader who may take Trump\u2019s words as tacit permission to move against Kurds in northern Syria, and a U.S. president who has made clear he wants out of the region, the Pentagon is approaching a junction that the military feared was coming for some time.\n\nThe Defense Department \u201cmade lemonade out of lemons\u201d the first time Trump announced a Syria withdrawal, said Derek Chollet, an assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. The Pentagon withdrew 1,000 of its 2,000 troops, moved some command elements to Iraq, and continued to aid Kurdish fighters still fighting the Islamic State and holding some 11,000 Islamic State prisoners of war.\n\nBut officials did not trumpet their mission or their efforts.\n\nIt will be a lot harder to pull this feint again, military experts said, particularly if President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey goes ahead with his threatened incursion into northern Syria, as it has been the presence of U.S. troops alongside the Kurds that many believe has kept him at bay.\n\nPentagon officials were insisting Monday that the United States remained firmly opposed to a Turkish incursion. \u201cThe Department of Defense made clear to Turkey \u2014 as did the president \u2014 that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in northern Syria,\u201d Jonathan Hoffman, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement. He warned that \u201cunilateral action creates risk for Turkey,\u201d which would be responsible for thousands of Islamic State fighters being held by the Kurds.\n\nBut the departure of U.S. troops from northern Syria makes it far more difficult to hold together the coalition fighting the Islamic State.\n\nFor a while, the generals at the Pentagon thought they were succeeding within the narrow confines of maneuver room that Trump gave them, obeying the president\u2019s order while not deserting Kurdish partners and undercutting gains against the Islamic State in northeastern Syria. Defense Department officials devised a plan for the Pentagon to cut its combat force there roughly in half by early this past May, or to about 1,000 troops \u2014 and then pause with what commanders called a \u201cresidual force.\u201d\n\nThe military would then assesses conditions on the ground and reduce the number of forces periodically, if conditions allowed, until the force levels reached the 400 troops that Trump approved in February.\n\nAnd, above all else, military officials decided they would keep quiet about Syria. The strategy extended all the way to combat outposts in the country, where special forces officers were reminded that their mission could end quickly if the commander in chief was publicly reminded that there were still 1,000 troops there, according to one officer who recently returned from Syria.\n\nThe longer withdrawal timetable gave the Trump administration more time to negotiate with European allies who had said they would not leave troops in Syria if the United States withdrew all of its forces. It was also supposed to allow more time for Washington to work out details of a safe zone south of the Turkish border, where Erdogan wants to repatriate hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees now in Turkey. Turkey also wants to make sure Kurdish fighters cannot launch terrorist attacks across its border.\n\nBy late March, the American withdrawal settled around 1,000 troops \u2014 what the military calls an \u201ceconomy of force\u201d mission. The troops effectively operated between two allies: Turkey and the Kurds. Turkey is a decadeslong NATO partner. The Syrian Kurds are much more recent allies, but have played a pivotal role as the major ground force against the Islamic State.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- For nine months, the Pentagon played down the presence of its 1,000 troops in Syria, hoping that President Donald Trump would not focus on the extent to which the U.S. military was continuing to fight the Islamic State despite his order in December to pull out.On Sunday, the president appeared", "authors": ["Helene Cooper", "Eric Schmitt"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nS7b3uiVw5qnns6TFMeWqw--~B/aD0zNDgyO3c9NTIyMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/e4cca0d0-e9bc-11e9-b39f-8933ed7d52ca", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
