Sarah Jessica Parker has admitted that it's scary and unacceptable when selfie-seeking fans touch her without asking for permission first\n\nSarah, who is in Australia to promote her the launch of her SJP shoe collection in David Jones, said some selfie-seeking fans make her feel afraid.\n\n'The world is scary a little bit right now, there\u2019s a heightened awareness, there\u2019s tension, so that\u2019s the only thing that freaks me out is people grabbing me. I much prefer conversation to a selfie,' she explained.\n\nSarah added: 'What\u2019s happening now is that people actually grab you, people want a selfie, so there\u2019s no exchange of, \"Hello, how are you? Do you mind for a moment if we do a photograph?\" It\u2019s \"Can we do a selfie?\"'\n\n'There\u2019s no introduction and when they\u2019re doing it they\u2019re grabbing you,' Sarah clarified further.\n\nShort visit: Sarah, who is in Australia to promote her the launch of her SJP shoe collection in David Jones, said some selfie-seeking fans make her feel afraid\n\n'There\u2019s no introduction and when they\u2019re doing it they\u2019re grabbing you': Sarah said she'd prefer a conversation with fans before an abrupt attempt to take a selfie with her\n\nSarah Jessica is not the first celebrity to call out 'selfie culture' either.\n\nIn 2015, Justin Beiber said on his Snapchat: 'The way that you [fans] ask or approach me when you want a photo with me is going to determine if I take a photo or not.'\n\n'I want to enjoy the moment just as you're enjoying the moment, but I can't enjoy it if I'm not feeling like there's any respect given to me at that moment... please just respect me and just treat me the way you would want to be treated,' he added.\n\nIn 2016, he then berated a Melbourne fan for persisting in her attempts to get a selfie, saying on camera: 'Look at you, you make me sick!'\n\n'Please just respect me!'
