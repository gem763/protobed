O.J. Simpson\u201d \u2014 suggests they would want to revisit their most famous roles. Matt LeBlanc has already seen how a surefire hit can go sour with the short-lived \u201cFriends\u201d spinoff \u201cJoey,\u201d and had far more success mocking his own fame on the Showtime series \u201cEpisodes,\u201d cocreated by Crane. Matthew Perry has worked steadily in television since \u201cFriends,\u201d and was noticeably absent from a 2016 tribute to the \u201cFriends\u201d director James Burrows attended by the rest of the cast. And Jennifer Aniston is already committed to a splashy new series on Apple TV Plus, \u201cThe Morning Show.\u201d\n\n(Previous reports have placed great emphasis on pronouncements by Aniston that she would be open to a \u201cFriends\u201d reunion, but these should likely be read as loose statements of enthusiasm, rather than declarations of intent. \u201cI think it\u2019s casual talk-show stuff,\u201d Bright said.)\n\n\u201cPeople have to accept that creative people do want to do other things,\u201d Bright said. \u201cAt a certain point, going backward, they didn\u2019t want to do the show anymore.\u201d\n\nWhen Were You Under Me?\n\nCouldn\u2019t the \u201cFriends\u201d creators just find a new batch of six charming 20-somethings to have New York adventures in improbably large apartments? Technically, sure. But \u201cthe only thing that I think would motivate anyone to do that is greed, and that\u2019s not a good enough reason,\u201d Crane said.\n\nBesides, \u201cFriends\u201d is still minting money as a streaming hit. Netflix doesn\u2019t generally release streaming figures, but the show is so popular the service paid $100 million to keep it through 2019. (Next year \u201cFriends\u201d moves to WarnerMedia\u2019s HBO Max platform.) So where another show\u2019s producers might be tempted to return as a way to cash in, the ongoing streaming success of the original \u201cFriends\u201d makes the creators far less likely to come back solely for a payday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like winning the lottery and then buying more tickets,\u201d Crane said. \u201cWhy? You won!\u201d\n\nWe Were [Never] on a Break\n\nUltimately, many \u201cFriends\u201d veterans are leery of doing anything that might damage the show\u2019s legacy.", "description": "Enjoy the 236 episodes of \u201cFriends\u201d you have, because they might be all you\u2019re going to get.", "authors": ["Saul Austerlitz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/arts/08FRIENDS-reboot/08FRIENDS-reboot-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
