Especially as people woke up to realize that Prescott thrived against the NFL dregs that are the Washington Redskins, Miami Dolphins and New York Giants. He struggled in losses to the Packers and New Orleans Saints.\n\nJerry Jones talks Prescott\u2019s contract\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe chatter prompted Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to speak up on his weekly segment on 105.3 in Dallas Tuesday. His official line is that as far as he\u2019s concerned, this small sample size will have no impact on negotiations with the quarterback making $2.1 million this season on the fourth year of his rookie deal.\n\n\u201cWell, first of all, the narrative about his financial as opposed to how he's playing is laughable,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt's just not that way. It's too much on both ends of that for both ends of the team and for Dak to equate his performance, stats, or won-loss these first two or three games.\u201d\n\nJones expressed a confidence in Prescott that suggests that he\u2019s still due for a big payday from the Cowboys, though it seems unlikely that will be in the neighborhood of the $40 million annual salary Prescott has reportedly sought.\n\n\u201cLet me get that real clear. It's not impacting that with me at all,\u201d Jones said of this season\u2019s play. \u201cBut I do see Dak showing the ability to handle adversity and basically go out and make the kind of plays that win important games for the Cowboys in the future. I see that.\u201d\n\nPrescott more like Aaron Rodgers or Kirk Cousins?\n\nStory continues\n\nThe longer this situation drags out, the more it looks like the Kirk Cousins situation with the Washington Redskins \u2014 minus the complete lack of competence from management that saw Washington slap the franchise tag on its quarterback twice before letting him walk.\n\nDak Prescott's struggles against top teams and feasts on bad ones should give Jerry Jones an idea of where things stand. (Getty)\n\nPrescott\u2019s a fine NFL quarterback\n\nSo far in his career, Prescott has done little to demonstrate that he\u2019s more than an average starter in the NFL \u2014 a guy who can put up decent numbers but isn\u2019t a difference-maker in high-stakes games. That\u2019s a familiar narrative for Redskins and Vikings fans who are now lamenting the $84 million deal their team signed Cousins to to win his free agency bid two offseasons ago.\n\nPrescott \u2014 like Cousins \u2014 entered the league as a fourth-round pick without much pedigree. He took over the Cowboys job as a rookie when Tony Romo suffered a back injury and held onto it thanks to a 13-3 record aided by a premium running game and arguably the best offensive line in football.\n\nLike Cousins, Prescott has put up solid, but not spectacular numbers during his first three-plus seasons, completing 66.5 percent of his passes with 78 touchdowns and 31 interceptions. He\u2019s yet to throw for more than 23 touchdowns in a single season, though he\u2019s on pace to do so this year with 11 through five games.\n\nBut again, his hot start was aided by feasting on the league\u2019s worst teams. Prescott has had the benefit of playing with Ezekiel Elliott and an elite offensive line since he joined the league.\n\nHe\u2019s not great\n\nMost NFL quarterbacks would put up decent numbers standing behind that offensive line. And Prescott\u2019s not demonstrated anything to suggest he\u2019s on the level of top-tier quarterbacks who step up to make the difference in big games.\n\nHe didn\u2019t do so against the Saints and Packers where he threw two touchdowns and four interceptions in losses against the NFC\u2019s best. He struggled under pressure Sunday without the benefit of injured left tackle Tyron Smith. He didn\u2019t do so in a playoff loss to the Los Angeles Rams last season.\n\nIf he was elite, we\u2019d know it by now.\n\nBut Dallas, unlike Washington with Cousins, appears ready to sign Prescott to a big deal. All signs point to it being a matter of when, not if.\n\nWhen Prescott\u2019s eating up $30-plus million of the salary cap instead of $2 million, the Cowboys won\u2019t have the flexibility to line up the talent he\u2019s surrounded by now.\n\nThat\u2019s when we\u2019ll truly find out what kind of quarterback Prescott is.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Dak Prescott's struggles against top teams and feasts on bad ones should give Jerry Jones an idea of where things stand.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xU7xMjvveTQDpp0sMlRF_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wKxALGbUlqIowTFj_lyedQ--~B/aD0yNjQ0O3c9Mzk2NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/32a5bd10-ea1b-11e9-9fbe-4dfe18d790c0", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
