Thabo Sibandze, who is alleged to be linked to a \u201chigh-profile case\u201d, appeared at the Thohoyandou Magistrate\u2019s Court last week.\n\nMani and Musetsho were members of the SA Municipal Workers\u2019 Union as well as employees at the Vhembe District Municipality, which had deposited R311 million into VBS Mutual Bank in contravention of regulations.\n\nThey were gunned down in separate incidents earlier this year. The two were outspoken about the looting of the bank from which close to R1.2 billion was stolen. Their killings are suspected to be linked to the VBS scandal because days before they were gunned down they had addressed striking municipal workers who were protesting against the looting.\n\nPeter Muleya, executive member of the SACP\u2019s Vhembe branch, was at the meeting with the prosecutors. He said they discussed the investigations into the deaths of the two men and called for their families to be updated. They also discussed Sibandze\u2019s court appearance.\n\nRead: ANC slams cops as political killers are still on the loose\n\n\u201cIt was agreed that the justice cluster and police officials should, from now on, start updating the two families on the progress of the case,\u201d said Muleya.\n\nHe said an update should be given to the families before Sibandze returned to court on September 30.\n\nThe families wanted to know if his arrest was linked to the killings, he said.\n\nSibandze (27), who is from eSwatini is also facing a charge of illegal immigration since he entered the country without proper documentation.\n\nMukurukuru Media reported that he was arrested in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni.\n\nDuring the brief court hearing last Wednesday, prosecutor Mashudu Nekhumbe argued that since the suspect was linked to a high-profile case, it should be postponed as the Director of Public Prosecutions was still busy with investigations. Nekhumbe said such a case should be tried at a regional court.\n\nEven though they knew that their lives were in danger and there were people threatening them, they refused to be intimidated. Hulisani Mani\n\nLast week at the state capture commission of inquiry, chaired by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, it was revealed that Limpopo mayors, who were allegedly implicated in the mismanagement of funds which were invested in the bank, were invited to testify on their dealings.\n\nThe commission also expects the municipalities implicated in the scandal to present turnaround strategies to deal with corruption in the supply management chain.\n\nHulisani Mani, the son of the Ronald Mani, said the two comrades were disciplined and that it was \u201cimportant to follow in their footsteps while supporting the two families\u201d.\n\n\u201cEven though they knew that their lives were in danger and there were people threatening them, they refused to be intimidated. After comrade TT [Tshililo Timson Musetsho] was shot, my father did not run away,\u201d he said. \u201cHe continued with the same routine by raising the same issues. It is important that we continue to confront the enemy by being honest to the struggle.\u201d\n\nHulisani called on the Vhembe community to unite because \u201ccorrupt officials were stealing from the poor [which resulted in them] not receiving basic service delivery\u201d.\n\nRead: Limpopo\u2019s sorry state: Millions spent on consultants, residents still face dire water shortages\n\nHe said the corruption matter was not about his father and Musetsho but about the voiceless people of Vhembe.\n\nTshenuwani Dean Farisani, a member of the Pastors\u2019 Forum, called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to deal with corruption \u201cbecause the nation is being pounced on like eggs\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are being finished,\u201d he said.\n\nFarisani also called on police minister Bheki Cele to finish his job in finding the killers of the two men because families no longer felt safe.\n\n\u201cIf it means calling out the army just like in the Cape, so be it. This freedom is ours,\u201d said Farisani.\n\nSibandze\u2019s case was postponed to September 30. He remains in custody. \u2013 Mukurukuru Media", "description": "Union federation Cosatu and the SA Communist Party (SACP) in Limpopo\u2019s Vhembe district are concerned about the way in which investigations into the deaths of their comrades, Ronald Mani and Tshililo Timson Musetsho, are being conducted.", "authors": ["Rolivhuwa Sadiki"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9218/5a0deb3a34724348a35761341189af3b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-12"}
