He played a key role in brokering an agreement over EU top jobs, launched a risky diplomatic initiative on Iran, reinvigorated efforts on Ukraine and hosted a G7 summit that at least managed to preserve the unity of the seven, unlike its two predecessors.\n\nThe French president\u2019s effort to carve out a role as the essential middle man in global diplomacy is based partly on clear confidence that he can handle two temperamental peers: Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe jury is out on whether Macron will ultimately succeed with any of his foreign policy forays. So far, he has little to show in terms of concrete results. His previous efforts to win over Trump (on the Iran nuclear deal or climate) and Putin (on Syria and cyberwarfare) came up short and didn\u2019t shield him from the Twitter wrath of the White House resident-in-chief.\n\nTwo summits he held on Libya garnered little more than headlines and not only failed to improve the situation on the ground but were seen as counterproductive by some European officials.\n\nLonger term, Macron will be judged on whether he can make progress on protracted problems such as relations with Iran and the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nNevertheless, Macron, whose foreign policy chops were among his biggest weaknesses at the start of his term in 2017, has seized on Trump\u2019s retreat from the multilateral arena, Britain\u2019s Brexit funk and German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s political twilight as an opening to bolster France\u2019s diplomatic dealmaking credentials, even if they\u2019re still no match for American might.\n\n\u201cThe role of France is to be a mediating power \u2026 our unique role is to speak with everyone \u2026 and try to build useful solutions on a universal level,\u201d Macron told reporters at the end of the G7 summit in Biarritz.\n\nFrance has, of course, long played a leading role in international diplomacy. The country\u2019s status as a nuclear power, its robust military and its permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council all give it clout that other countries \u2014 even the more economically powerful Germany \u2014 can\u2019t match.\n\nBut Macron has made a concerted effort to step it up a gear.\n\n\u201cNot since the [2015] Paris climate agreement has France played such a central role in international diplomacy,\u201d said Michel Duclos, a retired French ambassador who served in Russia, New York and Syria and is now a senior adviser at the French think tank Institut Montaigne.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many leaders who are able to expose themselves like he does, or assemble the conditions for action like he has\u201d \u2014 Senior French diplomat\n\nSo far, Macron\u2019s efforts to fill the void left by the U.S. have not upset other big European powers such as Germany and the U.K. Some diplomats in those countries even admire Macron for stepping up to the plate.\n\n\u201cMacron is occupying that space, and he\u2019s coming up with ideas,\u201d said a high-level British diplomat.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone ready to take risks, and he was rewarded somehow in the context of the G7,\u201d said a German diplomatic official.\n\nAt that summit, Macron managed to keep Trump on side, even when he allowed Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to fly into Biarritz for talks as the leaders were still meeting, and Trump was across the street. He also engaged in a headline-grabbing spat with Brazilian president over the Amazon.\n\nThe concrete results of the summit were more modest \u2014 including an aid package for the Amazon and limited progress on digital tax. But longer term, Macron will be judged on whether he can make progress on protracted problems such as relations with Iran and the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nIran plan\n\nPerhaps no other issue illustrates Macron\u2019s newfound international role more than Iran, arguably the most complex international crisis at the moment. The diplomatic effort he has been leading since June has at least had the merit of still being alive and kicking, unlike a previous attempted mediation by Japan.\n\n\u201cMacron has acquired personal credibility on this,\u201d said a senior French diplomat. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many leaders who are able to expose themselves like he does, or assemble the conditions for action like he has.\u201d\n\nFrench officials said this week they have been discussing with both Iranian and U.S. officials the possibility of an oil-backed credit line for Tehran, in what could be the most concrete breakthrough to both stop Iran from further breaching the nuclear deal and prepare the way for a summit meeting with Trump.\n\nIn return for the credit line, Tehran would have to fully comply with the 2015 nuclear deal and commit to not threatening security in the Gulf or impeding freedom of maritime navigation. The country would also have to agree to future talks on Middle East security and on more long-term nuclear arrangements, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian said Tuesday. The credit line would be guaranteed by Iranian oil.\n\nBut while diplomats may admire Macron\u2019s chutzpah, the reception to the French proposal in Washington underscores how hard it will be to turn his audacity into concrete results.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no appetite for the credit line idea \u2014 at least the French version as we know it now,\u201d said a U.S. official.\n\nBut, ultimately, it is Trump who will decide whether Macron\u2019s efforts succeed. As the U.S. official added, \u201cThe big question is, \u2018What the hell\u2019s in Trump\u2019s mind?\u2019\u201d\n\nMacron has made clear he believes that only engagement with Moscow will contribute to resolving some of the biggest challenges facing Europe.\n\nMacron hasn\u2019t spared any effort in trying to keep Trump happy.\n\nSeizing on the U.S. president\u2019s penchant for big deals and historic meetings, Macron and his team are hoping he will sign off on the credit line if it meant he could get a summit meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, possibly in a few weeks at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\u201cAll this won\u2019t work unless at some point Rouhani accepts to see Trump,\u201d said the senior French diplomat. \u201cIf they refuse it won\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nMacron has been personally invested in the negotiations. He has had six phone conversations with Rouhani about the nuclear deal since the end of June. Senior Iranian officials have visited France four times in the last month, and Macron\u2019s diplomatic adviser has paid two visits to Iran and traveled as far as China and India in support of French efforts to reduce tensions.\n\nThe French president is advancing in a minefield. The Trump administration is deeply divided between hard-liners, like National Security Adviser John Bolton, who believe in pursuing unbridled pressure on Tehran, and Trump and a few other officials who feel there might be an opening to make a deal.\n\nIranian authorities are just as divided, between the president\u2019s camp and the uncompromising Revolutionary Guards. Israel and Saudi Arabia have also been less than enthused by the idea of a softer line with Iran.\n\nRussia risk\n\nAnother fraught arena in which Macron has doubled down is Russia. He recently called on his diplomatic establishment to \u201crethink our relationship to Russia\u201d and \u201cbuild a new architecture of trust and security in Europe,\u201d one that includes Moscow.\n\nDespite continued Russian cyberattacks, Moscow\u2019s participation in bombing campaigns that have killed civilians in Syria and the poisoning of Russian citizens living in the U.K., Macron has made clear he believes that only engagement with Moscow will contribute to resolving some of the biggest challenges facing Europe, starting with Ukraine.\n\nMacron hosted Putin at his summer retreat in the south of France in the run-up to the G7, and announced afterward that the Russian and Ukrainian presidents were ready to move forward with a prisoner exchange and the demilitarization of the Donbas region as confidence-building measures ahead of a planned summit meeting with France and Germany later this month in Paris.\n\nLast week, a prisoner exchange seemed to be close, but the initiative then faltered.\n\nMacron\u2019s outreach to Putin hasn\u2019t gone down well with everyone. Ukraine\u2019s leaders resent the idea that there should be any compromise with Russia, which they see as the clear aggressor in the conflict. Other Central and Eastern European governments are also wary of anything that could be seen as cozying up to Putin.\n\n\u201cI am extraordinarily skeptical of his overall approach toward Russia and the language he uses with Russia, because I think it is doomed to fail,\u201d said Bruno Tertrais, deputy director of the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris. \u201cThe language used publicly by Macron about Russia is in my opinion out of place and counter-productive because it seems to say that the errors are mainly Western and that it\u2019s all misunderstandings.\u201d\n\nBut the supremely self-confident Macron, who started out as a long-shot candidate before upending France\u2019s political establishment to claim the presidency, seems to be banking on his political and personal skills to reset relations with Putin.\n\n\u201cHe persists, it\u2019s how he won the presidential election,\u201d Tertrais said. \u201cBut I do not think that his personal qualities will be sufficient to transform our relationship with Russia.\u201d\n\nNahal Toosi in Washington contributed reporting.", "description": "Macron aims to seize role as global middle man", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MacronW240xH172-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
