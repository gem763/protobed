Some would call it a mess,\" Pallister said in a victory speech to supporters after Tuesday's provincial election. \"Manitobans worked with us, all hands on deck. Manitobans have repaired Manitoba's foundation.\"\n\nDespite their win, the PCs won fewer seats than they had at the end of the last legislative session, while the NDP are projected to make significant gains.\n\nAs of 11:35 p.m. CT, CBC News is projecting PC wins in 36 ridings, including Pallister's seat in Fort Whyte.\n\nAfter addressing a jubilant crowd at the Canad Inns Polo Park, Pallister basked in the glow of winning back-to-back majorities, while also acknowledging some of his government's shortcomings and promising to do better.\n\n\"We need to improve in terms of strategies, in terms of communicating with front-line workers, what is going on, why it's going on and how it'll to work \u2026 and I accept that,\" Pallister told reporters.\n\n\"But I also think it would be wrong to suggest that getting close to half the popular support in back-to-back elections was anything resembling a rebuke.\"\n\nOnly three years into his first term, Pallister called the election more than a year before the fixed election date of Oct. 6, 2020. This gave an advantage to the PCs, who were ahead in the polls and flush with cash, while the other parties were left trying to catch up.\n\nWatch: PC Leader Brian Pallister praises supporters\n\nPC Leader praises province's past - but says his team is also looking to the future. 1:32\n\nCBC News is projecting the NDP has won 18 seats, which is six more than they had when the legislature was dissolved.\n\nNDP Leader Wab Kinew won his seat in Fort Rouge, blocking Green Party Leader James Beddome, who also ran in that constituency.\n\nBeaming during a speech to supporters, Kinew said he had called Pallister and conceded that the PCs had won the election, although he sounded a celebratory note.\n\n\"I don't think we were defeated tonight,\" he said, noting the NDP had increased their number of seats in the legislature.\n\n\"The seats that we took back made it very clear that Manitobans wants us, the New Democrats, to not only be the conscience of Manitoba, not only be the opposition of Manitoba, but be the progressive voice of Manitoba.\"\n\nWatch: NDP Leader Wab Kinew says NDP is 'progressive voice'\n\nWab Kinew says the NDP is still a 'progressive voice' for Manitobans 0:37\n\nThe Green Party of Manitoba lost its best chance at gaining their first seat in the legislature, as CBC News is projecting David Nickarz has lost the race for the Wolseley constituency. He came close to winning the seat in the 2016 election, but the NDP's Lisa Naylor is projected to win it this time.\n\nThe quiet summer election appears to have kept a significant number of eligible voters away from the polls. With 97 per cent of polls reporting voter turnout was estimated at around 53 per cent, down from 57.4 per cent in the 2016 election.\n\nWith a second term secured, the PCs are likely to continue pursuing first-term policy priorities like slashing the province's deficit and overhauling the health-care system. They'll also likely embark on a major revamp of the province's education system once a government-ordered review is complete.\n\nAttention also turns to how much of this second term Pallister will serve. Political observers have speculated his retirement could come before the next election, after the budget has been balanced, although Pallister has said he will serve out his term.\n\nLiberals lose official status\n\nThe Manitoba Liberals, meanwhile, appear set to lose official party status. CBC News is projecting the party won't be able to claim the minimum four seats required.\n\nLiberal Leader Dougald Lamont gets a hug from a supporter as election results project the party will not win enough seats to retain official party status. (Alana Cole/CBC)\n\nThe Liberals faced an uphill battle to hold on to official status, which the party regained last year for the first time since 1995. They won the northern riding of Keewatinook in 2016, narrowly beating the NDP's Eric Robinson, but MLA Judy Klassen then jumped to the federal Liberals to run for the seat in Churchill\u2013Keewatinook Aski.\n\nThe Liberals ran Jason Harper in an attempt to fill Klassen's seat, but CBC News is projecting the NDP's Ian Bushie will take it.\n\nSt. Boniface remains a Liberal seat after leader Dougald Lamont held onto the constituency, CBC News is projecting. Lamont won the seat in a byelection last July, which marked a tipping point for the Liberals, bringing them into official party status. Lamont wrested the riding away from the NDP, which had claimed the riding for many years under former leader Greg Selinger.\n\nLongtime River Heights MLA Jon Gerrard is projected to win his seat again for the Liberals, CBC News projects.\n\nLiberal Cindy Lamoureux, meanwhile, is projected to win the seat in Tyndall Park after she chose not to run in her old constituency of Burrows when its borders were redrawn. She defeated NDP incumbent Ted Marcelino.\n\nDespite those wins, early results do not appear to give the Liberals the four seats needed to retain official party status.\n\n\"We ran a campaign we can be proud of and we can hold our heads high,\" Lamont told supporters Tuesday night as results rolled in. \"You can put in the best work of your life, and sometimes that's not enough. That's life, and that's politics.\"\n\nLocal races made history\n\nThe 2019 election will be remembered for increasing the diversity of Manitoba's representatives.\n\nThree black MLAs won seats in the legislature, where no black person had served before.\n\nUzoma Asagwara in Union Station and Jamie Moses in St. Vital won their seats for the NDP, while Audrey Gordon won the Southdale Constituency for the PCs.\n\nUzoma Asagwara made history as one of the first black MLAs elected to the Manitoba legislature. (Ahmar Khan/CBC)\n\n\"Our elected officials in our Manitoba Legislature should absolutely reflect the constituencies \u2026 and communities that are in Manitoba,\" Asagwara told CBC News as results came in Tuesday night.\n\n\"So making sure that our elected officials look like the communities we serve [is] fundamental in making sure that all voices and all communities are served well in Manitoba.\"\n\nAmong the projected winners are 12 out of 13 former PC cabinet ministers. Moses defeated former Crown Services Minister Colleen Mayer.\n\nOther projected winners for the PCs are Josh Guenter in Borderland, defeating disgraced former PC MLA Cliff Graydon, who was expelled from the PC caucus over sexual harassment allegations.\n\nThe NDP reclaimed their hold on the province's north. In addition to retaking Keewatinook, Danielle Adams won in Thompson, defeating incumbent PC candidate Kelly Bindle, who narrowly beat longtime NDP MLA Steve Ashton in 2016.", "description": "Brian Pallister will keep his job as premier of Manitoba after voters handed his Progressive Conservative party another majority government in Tuesday's election.", "authors": ["Web Writer", "Cameron Maclean Is A Journalist Living In Winnipeg", "Man.
