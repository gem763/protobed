Citigroup and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China joined the pledge, which begins by asking the firms to self-assess their sustainability practices. Signers, including top European banks BNP Paribas SA, Barclays Plc and UBS Group AG, also agreed to develop and publish plans and targets attached to sustainability goals by 2023.\n\nThere\u2019s a wide range of stronger actions that banks could take, for example, banning thermal coal financing or setting a time line to phase out funding of the fossil-fuel industry. One of the signers, ING Groep NV, said last week it would boost lending to automakers producing more electric vehicles than those that produce vehicles with internal combustible engines.\n\nThe principles follow another set of voluntary standards for the asset-management industry - the Principles for Responsible Investment - that were adopted by money managers 13 years ago to encourage firms to incorporate environmental, social and governance factors into their investments. The industry has since grown to more than $30 trillion.\n\nAmong the banks that declined to participate, some said they have their own sustainability programs. Others said they\u2019re still reviewing the PRB.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a statement that it has a number of target-related efforts similar to the PRB underway and will continue to engage with the UN PRB as the initiative develops further. Wells Fargo & Co. said it was successfully working toward goals it had set in 2016 to address social, economic and environmental challenges over a five-year period. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.\n\n'A signal'\n\nUN Assistant Secretary General Satya Tripathi said the reluctance of some banks to commit is a signal the principles have teeth. \u201cSome are not ready to be held to account for their lending,\u201d he said during a September 19 panel discussion.\n\nThe PRB was launched at the start of the UN\u2019s Climate Action Summit in New York. Transitioning to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies that are aligned with the Paris Agreement requires additional investment of at least $60 trillion from now until 2050, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN\u2019s Framework Convention on Climate Change, said in a statement.\n\nThe PRB \u201coffers a ladder to climb for every bank, though some banks start very low and have a particularly big ladder to climb,\u201d said Peter Blom, chief executive officer at Triodos Bank, a Dutch lender that finances renewable energy and organic agriculture, and a signatory to the agreement.\n\nCritics say the principles aren\u2019t radical enough, and a four-year window to come up with plans to improve sustainability is too little, too late. In a joint statement, campaigners BankTrack and the Rainforest Action Network said \u201csuch time scales were perhaps adequate 30 years ago. Now, however, we consider them to be completely inadequate for the era in which we live.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Only two of the world\u2019s 10 biggest banks joined the coalition of 130 global financial firms in agreeing to align their business with international efforts to address climate change and other environmental issues.", "authors": ["Saijel Kishan", "Emily Chasan"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9267/0fee05565aa24a58b3298e04b6df2c5c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
