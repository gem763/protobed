Though, their reasons were more for the sake of their teenaged children, according to Paltrow Wednesday in an interview with Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nA survey conducted by the National Sleep Foundation survey found that 10 percent of married couples sleep in separate bedrooms completely while up to 25 percent sleep in separate beds. Moreover, a report by News Corp's Realtor.com has called the phenomenon a \u201csleep divorce.\u201d\n\nTo get to the bottom of how prevalent this trend is among current home buyers, FOX Business consulted with a number of real estate experts who know the market and customer demands well.\n\nWhy are couples buying homes with separate master bedrooms?\n\n\u201cIn my experience, snoring by one spouse is the main culprit for needing separate bedrooms. Some older people have medical issues (including equipment) that requires them to have more room,\u201d broker Michael J. Franco of Compass Real Estate wrote to FOX Business.\n\nSteven Gottlieb, an agent of Warburg Realty pointed out that he observed climate control being an issue with clients who requested separate bedrooms.\n\n\u201cI worked with a couple who needed a second bedroom for just this problem. The husband liked the room cold to sleep, or else he\u2019d lie there sweating. Conversely, the wife found that the air conditioner dried out her sinuses so severely that she\u2019d wake up with burning eyes, a headache, and a sore and dried out nose,\u201d he explained.\n\nMichelle Schwartz, a partner at The Agency said that couples wanting to sleep apart is more common than people think. The common culprits for this include different sleep and work schedules, health conditions, snoring issues and restless children.\n\nHowever, she pointed out that for some, there is a hidden financial reason for having a second master bedroom.\n\n\u201cWith prices where they are, it is often really difficult for a couple to be able to afford their down payment. Oftentimes, new homebuyers need financial assistance from family for at least a down payment. Having a secondary master in a home is a great way of providing their financial assister with their own true master, regardless of whether or not they live their full time,\u201d Schwartz revealed.\n\nHow much does it cost to add an extra bedroom on average?\n\n\u201cIt really depends on the type of property. In Manhattan, going from a classic 6-room to a 7-room on the Upper West Side or Upper East Side could cost you anywhere from $500,000 to $1,000,000 [or] more for that extra room everything else being equal,\u201d Franco said.\n\nSchwartz acknowledged that costs for room add-ons are variable.\n\n\u201cIt depends on quality and scale of the construction. I have seen some bedroom add-ons come in at a cost of $260 per square foot, all the way up to $600 per square foot. [It] totally depends on size, scale, finishes & the land build-ability,\u201d she said.\n\nOther options homebuyers can consider include building a guest house or converting an existing garage into an accessory dwelling unit.\n\nCan these homebuyers be characterized as rich or are they everyday middle class?\n\n\u201cI guess you would need to define rich. The few experiences I have had with this involved apartments ranging from $4 million on the sale side to upwards of $8 million on the replacement property side,\u201d Franco said regarding the clientele he serves. \u201cThese were wealthy clients even by New York standards.\u201d\n\nSchwartz agreed that homebuyers who are requesting second master bedrooms tend to have funds to spare.\n\n\u201cHaving two true masters in a property is usually found in higher end homes, as this would typically be a feature in a newer construction home, or a home that has been expanded and extensively remodeled over the years,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cOriginal, more modest homes under $2M can provide space for a partner to sleep in a separate room however it is unlikely to be a true secondary master.\u201d - Michelle Schwartz, a partner of luxury real estate company The Agency said.\n\nSchwartz added: \u201cIt is also important to add that more often than not, in a two story home, secondary master bedrooms are not typically on the same level which poses another set of issues depending on the couple\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nGottlieb, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t believe sleeping in a separate bedroom is something reserved for the wealthy.\n\n\u201cI think that this might be a problem that doesn\u2019t discriminate based on socioeconomics, but only people with substantial extra assets or income can afford an entire extra bedroom,\u201d he said. \u201cMy aforementioned clients made use of the living room sofa when they could not agree on climate control for the bedroom.\u201d\n\nWhy would a couple opt for a separate bedroom instead of a \"man cave\" or \"she shed?\"\n\n\u201cIf sleeping habits are the real issue, and not just an allocated \u201cseparate space,\u201d then an extra bedroom would be ideal on an as needed basis. If someone in the couple has a bad flu, then sleeping apart on nights like these makes sense too,\u201d Gottlieb offered as possible scenarios.\n\nHowever, Schwartz said having time to perform individual evening rituals is often a priority for couples.\n\n\u201cBy having a separate room to wind down and actually sleep in, you are provided with your own space to make your own. Some couples have vastly different bed times and wake up times, and separating the bedroom can help normalize daily routines,\u201d she explained.\n\nDespite this, Schwartz reaffirmed that separate master bedrooms are primarily used for sleeping.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nAre children also a factor that plays in the decision for having separate master bedrooms? If so, how?\n\n\u201cIf children have sleeping problems, like infants for example, one parent might be in charge of waking up for feedings, diaper changing, or comforting. If one parent is waking up multiple times per night and the other parent is a light sleeper, then separate bedrooms might be great,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nSchwartz noted that the location of the secondary master can often be dictated by whether or not there are children present. However she said that having an extra bedroom at all may be more imperative for couples than worrying about its location.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nAccording to a 2017 report on Realtor.com, a top 10 percent of the market nationwide had active listings with more than one master bedroom. The real estate website\u2019s analysts said that these listings were priced about nine percent higher on average than those with a single master.", "description": "More couple are choosing to sleep apart.
