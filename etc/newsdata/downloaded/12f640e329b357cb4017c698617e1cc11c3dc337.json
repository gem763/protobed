It was almost surreal.\u201d\n\nRatcliffe, who is also clinical research director at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said in a statement he was \u201chonoured and delighted at the news\u201d.\n\nThe scientists\u2019 work established the basis for understanding of how oxygen levels are sensed by cells - a discovery that is being explored by medical researchers seeking to develop treatments for various diseases that work by either activating or blocking the body\u2019s oxygen-sensing machinery.\n\nTheir work centres on the hypoxic response - the way the body reacts to oxygen flux - and \u201crevealed the elegant mechanisms by which our cells sense oxygen levels and respond\u201d said Andrew Murray, an expert at Britain\u2019s University of Cambridge who congratulated the three.\n\n\u201cVITAL INGREDIENT\u201d\n\n\u201cOxygen is the vital ingredient for the survival of every cell in our bodies. Too little \u2013 or too much \u2013 can spell disaster. Understanding how evolution has equipped cells to detect and respond to fluctuating oxygen levels helps answer fundamental questions,\u201d said Venki Ramakrishnan, president of Britain\u2019s Royal Society scientific academy.\n\n\u201cAs (this) work.. shows us, it also gives insights into the way these processes continue to shape our health and wellbeing.\u201d\n\nRandall Johnson, a professor at Sweden\u2019s Karolinska Institute where the prize is awarded, said it was \u201ca prize that really tells us the fundamental truth about how cells work\u201d.\n\nDuring exercise, for example, the body uses oxygen at a rapid pace, \u201cand this is a switch that helps the cell figure out how much oxygen it\u2019s getting and how it should behave.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you have a stroke there\u2019s suddenly no oxygen going to the brain... Those cells, if they are going to survive, need to find a way to adapt to that level of oxygen,\u201d he said.\n\nMedicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes given each year. The prizes for achievements in science, peace and literature have been awarded since 1901 and were created in the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nNobel medicine laureates have included scientific greats such as Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, and Karl Landsteiner, who identified separate blood types and so enabled safe transfusions to be widely introduced.\n\nThomas Perlmann, a member of the Nobel Assembly, said he had reached Kaelin by phone early on Monday to tell him on the award. \u201cHe was really happy, almost speechless,\u201d Perlmann said.\n\nLast year American James Allison and Japanese Tasuku Honjo won the prize for discoveries about how to harness the immune system in cancer therapies.", "description": "Two Americans and a Briton won the 2019 Nobel Medicine Prize on Monday for discovering a molecular switch that regulates how cells adapt to fluctuating oxygen levels, opening up new approaches to treating heart failure, anaemia and cancer.", "authors": ["Niklas Pollard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438020247&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960KY", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
