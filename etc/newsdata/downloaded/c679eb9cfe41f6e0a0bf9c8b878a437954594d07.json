Its 14 rooms were booked solid.\n\n\u201cThere is no gas available in Rachel. Fill your tank in Alamo/Ash Springs from the east or Tonopah from the west,\u201d the hotel\u2019s website warns potential visitors. The only gas station in the town closed back in 2006. Alamo, 50 miles away, is home to the nearest one now.\n\nWhile the so-called \"Alienstock\" had authorities and residents concerned, because of the strain it could put on local services, the crowd that materialized at the Air Force base's gates numbered a little over 100, smaller than the potential throng of 2 million.Thousands more traveled to festivals, and several hundred made forays in the direction of Area 51.\n\nMeanwhile, Matty Roberts, a 20-year-old from Bakersfield, California, who sparked the Area 51 phenomenon with a late-night Facebook post and then broke with Little A'Le'Inn owner Connie West over production of the Rachel event, hosted a Thursday evening event at an outdoor venue in downtown Las Vegas -- also using the \"Alienstock\" name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It started as a joke, and now people are getting to know each other,\" said Tracy Ferguson, 23, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, who said the internet gave him the idea to drive to Nevada with his girlfriend, Jade Gore, 19, of Worthington, Minnesota.\n\nGore quit her job at a Dairy Queen and dyed her hair and eyebrows green. They drove through Wyoming, Utah and into Nevada with \"Area 51 bound\" and \"Comin 4 Dem Alien Cheeks\" in green paint on their car windows.\n\n\"People were taking pictures and laughing the whole way,\" Gore said.\n\nBy noon Friday, they had visited the Little A'Le'Inn in Rachel, the Alien Research Center in Hiko and the Rachel gate to Area 51. By Saturday, they would be in Las Vegas, they said.\n\n\"Area 51 Basecamp\" in Hiko began featuring music, speakers and movies -- headlined by an electronic dance music DJ who tours the world and attracts packed clubs on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nAlien Research Center owner George Harris said he expected a crowd of 5,000, but authorities said the audience and nearby campers appeared to number in the hundreds.\n\nNo word on any area-restaurant discounts for visitors from Mars or Venus. However, when the \"Storm Area 51\" event was first announced this summer, fast-food chain Arby's said it would have a presence in the vicinity and offer a presumably out-of-this world menu.\n\nAccording to Las Vegas TV station KSNV, Arby's planned to offer a \"Redacted on Rye\" which is a roasted turkey sandwich and the \"E.T. Slider,\" featuring a crispy chicken tender dipped in Bronco Berry sauce. To wash it down, tourists could buy a \"Galaxy Shake.\"\n\nLike the Little A'Le'Inn,\" camping/RV lots in the area were full. Prices rangeed from only $20 for an \u201cRV spot with power and water hookup\u201d to $190 for rooms, which include free Wifi.\n\n\u201cWalk in... Drive in... Fly in... Get to Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn!!! ET's & Earthlings Welcome Always,\u201d the hotel\u2019s website reads.\n\n\u201cThere should be a little something here for all our alien friends. Even those with two or four legs,\u201d the hotel said.\n\nOther nearby hotels, motels and bed-and-breakfasts were completely sold out as well, with the Sunset View Inn and Alamo Inn booked clear through the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, law enforcement in the area warned that a large influx of visitors could put an immense strain on emergency personnel, especially considering the extreme desert heat as summer comes to a close.\n\n\"We could probably handle it, but it could definitely cause issues. Heaven forbid the number is 5,000 people where you almost double the size of the county,\" Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee told CNN in August.\n\n\"I could see people with a lot of heat-related issues, and with our limited resources up here, it could definitely jeopardize their safety. The number of people could overwhelm our EMS in a hurry,\" Lee added.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The closest hotel to the government installation known as Area 51 is in Rachel, Nevada, a town with a population of just 54 people.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/AP19232589871952.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
