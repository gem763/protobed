The cost to manufacture is often much lower than reselling another brand name, resulting in higher margins and increased revenue for sellers. Smartly is one of Target's many white label brands Target\n\nRetailers who implement this strategy also maintain wholesale control of the brand, including packaging and pricing, which generates product exclusivity as well as promotes customer recognition of and loyalty to the brand.\n\nPossibly the biggest benefit of private labels, however, is that they eliminate the pains of having to design and build a new product \u2014 especially when entering a new market. By outsourcing the entire process and leaving those details to the experts, sellers can instead focus on what they excel at: branding and marketing the finished product.\n\nBecause the benefits of this strategy are so multifaceted, it's no wonder private labeling is moving beyond consumer goods and gaining traction in service-based industries. Businesses looking to develop new offerings and product functionalities can now easily outsource entire technology stacks and tedious regulatory administration. White label banking is part of the open banking ecosystem Business Insider Intelligence\n\nAs tech giants like Apple, Amazon, and Google deepen their financial services plays, banking and personal finance tools have become a prime opportunity for fintechs and smaller firms to leverage private labeling to compete, and for established players to unlock new revenue streams.\n\nHere's a look inside how private labeling is transforming the banking industry\u2014 and which products are on the rise.\n\nWhat is white label banking?\n\nWhite label banking is another term for private label banking or banking-as-a-service (BaaS), in which banks open up their application program interfaces (APIs) to let third parties build their own financial products with existing infrastructure. White label banking accelerates the builder's go-to-market strategy by removing regulatory, legal, and technical obstacles.\n\nWhite label banking services\n\nWhite label banking services enable fintechs and third parties to showcase a sleek, company-branded frontend, while leveraging an established bank's license, regulatory compliance, and technology on the backend to offer core banking features that rival major institutions'.\n\nCommon white label banking services include:\n\nSavings and checking accounts\n\nCurrent accounts\n\nDebit and credit cards\n\nSimplified bill payments\n\nOnline payment transfer systems\n\nPersonal loans\n\nMortgages\n\nInsurance\n\nBank statements with transaction details\n\nBalance notifications\n\nWhite label banking apps\n\nSome examples of mobile banking apps built with white label features include:\n\nADIB Chime offers a \"no-fees\" bank account. Chime\n\nAlbaraka Mobil\n\nAzlo\n\nB\u00f6rse Stuttgart App\n\nChime\n\nCompte CO2\n\nDigit\n\nDozens\n\nKnotist business banking\n\nMoneyLion\n\nNationwide Mobile\n\nQapital\n\nQonto\n\nScore Kompass\n\nSimple Stash uses white label banking to allow users to incrementally invest small amounts Stash\n\nSpendesk\n\nStash\n\nTomorrow\n\nTrade Republic\n\nVan Lanschot\n\nVitesse Mobile\n\nXero Accounting & Invoices\n\nFuture of white label banking services\n\nAcross industries, digital technologies are democratizing information to spur more competition and innovation. Because of this, the trend towards \"open access\" will only become more pervasive. In the banking industry, particularly, the open banking movement has been unfurling from its epicenter in the UK and stretching across the globe for the past few years.\n\nWhite label banking and BaaS technology are no longer brand new technologies in the industry, but firms that get involved now will still be ahead of the curve by the time regulation becomes mainstream. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has already enrolled the nine biggest banks and building societies in its Open Banking Directory, and others are coming soon. After that, it won't be long before other countries follow suit with their own regulations. White label banking/BaaS is a key component to the Open Banking movement Business Insider Intelligence\n\nPer Accenture estimates, \u20ac61 billion ($70 billion) or 7% of total banking revenue in Europe will be associated with open banking-enabled activities by 2020. Incumbent banks around the world that invest in open banking platforms now - before it's mandated - will be rewarded with new revenue streams, an early boost in demand, partnerships with tech-savvy fintechs, and an overall competitive advantage against newcomers in the space.\n\nTo stay ahead of trends like white label banking, Business Insider Intelligence is launching a Banking coverage area in September. Tailored for top decision-makers in the financial services industry, this vertical covers digital transformation across the industry, including open banking and BaaS, consumer and business banking, mobile and online banking, digital account opening, and neobanks.\n\nInterested in getting the full report?
