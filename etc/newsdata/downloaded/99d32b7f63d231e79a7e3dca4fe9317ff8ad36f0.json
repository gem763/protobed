Giuliani, a former New York City mayor, is Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nCorreia, 44, was to make an initial appearance later Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan. Court records had not yet listed a name for his lawyer.\n\nProsecutors said Correia, an American-born businessman who owns a home with his wife in West Palm Beach, was part of efforts by co-defendants Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman to leverage outsized political donations to advance their business interests.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

At the time, Giuliani was trying to get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Trump\u2019s potential Democratic challenger Joe Biden.\n\nGiuliani has said he had no knowledge of illegal donations and hadn\u2019t seen any evidence that Parnas and Fruman did anything wrong.\n\nCorreia is accused in a separate scheme of conspiring with the other defendants, including Ukrainian-born U.S. citizen Andrey Kukushkin, to make political donations to local and federal politicians in New York, Nevada and other states with the aim of trying to get support for a new recreational marijuana business.\n\nCorreia is listed as the registered agent for a Florida corporation tied to a series of wire transfers that prosecutors allege was part of an elaborate effort to hide the true source of funds used to make the donations.\n\nHe posed with then-Rep. Pete Sessions in a 2018 photo taken inside the Texas Republican\u2019s Capitol Hill office that Parnas posted on social media with the caption \u201cHard at work !!\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press reported last week that Sessions fits the description in the indictment of a congressman who prosecutors allege was part of a coordinated effort to remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nAt least some of the defendants are expected to appear in court Thursday for an arraignment.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A man wanted in a campaign finance case involving associates of Giuliani is in federal custody after turning himself in, authorities said.", "authors": ["Tom Hays"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/geoffrey-berman.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
