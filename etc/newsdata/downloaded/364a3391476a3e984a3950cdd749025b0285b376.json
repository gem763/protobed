Protesters say they will not stop until the territory\u2019s chief executive and legislators are chosen through democratic elections.\n\nChinese officials want the situation to stabilise before making a final decision on whether to proceed with a leadership change, as they don\u2019t want to be seen to be giving in to violence, according to the people briefed on the discussions.\n\nOfficials are hoping the violence will subside as arrests mount and now weekly vandalisation dissipates public support for the protests. March is when China\u2019s rubber stamp parliament, the National People\u2019s Congress, holds its annual session.\n\nThe protest movement, now in its fifth month, is seen as the most serious challenge to Communist party authority on Chinese soil in three decades. Getty\n\nMs Lam\u2019s handling of the crisis has been marred by a series of mis-steps, including her decision to press ahead with the controversial extradition bill that sparked the protests even after a series of massive and peaceful marches in early June, analysts said. She was later forced to drop the bill.\n\nThe Financial Times reported in July that Ms Lam had offered to resign, but Beijing forced her to stay on. The Hong Kong and Chinese governments later denied that she had wanted to step down.\n\nMr Chan is one of the \u201cthree Chans\u201d viewed as possible successors to Ms Lam. But the other two \u2014 Paul Chan, financial secretary, and Bernard Chan, convener of an \u201cexecutive council\u201d that advises Ms Lam \u2014 are viewed as being too close to her now discredited administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which Norman Chan headed for a decade, is widely respected as an independent institution that has successfully managed the territory\u2019s US dollar currency peg for almost 40 years.\n\nMr Tang, meanwhile, only served under Ms Lam\u2019s predecessors.\n\n\u201cWe have to look within at people who have served in government but also know how business operates here,\u201d said one prominent member of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-Beijing establishment. \u201cAnd of course they need to be trusted by Beijing.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Ms Lam and the Chinese government\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a leaked audio recording, released last month by Reuters, Ms Lam said that \u201cfor a chief executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable\u201d. She added: \u201cIf I have a choice, the first thing is to quit, having made a deep apology.\u201d\n\nOn October 4, Ms Lam enacted emergency powers allowing her to bypass Hong Kong\u2019s Legislative Council and introduce a law that banned people from wearing masks during public assemblies, punishable by up to one year in prison.\n\nAs people participating in unauthorised or violent demonstrations already risked lengthy jail terms of up to 10 years, the ban only deterred people from wearing masks at peaceful marches and rallies that had secured police permits. Opposition to the move triggered Hong Kong\u2019s worst weekend of violence since the protests began, resulting in the closure of the territory\u2019s entire rail network for almost 48 hours.\n\nLast week, Ms Lam\u2019s annual policy address, which she had to deliver via a pre-taped video recording after pro-democracy legislators disrupted her speech, was also widely viewed as a missed opportunity to address at least some of the grievances fuelling the protests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe needed a big bang but this government doesn\u2019t have any imagination,\u201d said a senior executive at one of Hong Kong\u2019s largest companies.\n\n\u201cTo calm things down, Carrie Lam needed to do two things,\u201d said Simon Cartledge, author of a book about Hong Kong\u2019s political economy, A System Apart. \u201cFirst, announce an independent inquiry into the events of the last five months and second, say that when the time was right \u2014 say, early next year \u2014 her government would start looking at how to move Hong Kong\u2019s political development forward. That was all, but she did neither.\u201d\n\nMr Tang campaigned to be chief executive in 2012 and was initially viewed as Beijing\u2019s favourite for the post. But his popularity plummeted after it was discovered he had built an elaborate basement complex at his home without proper approvals.\n\nAs a result, Chinese government officials directed the 1200-member \u201celection committee\u201d that selects Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive to vote instead for his rival, Leung Chun-ying, who was leading Mr Tang in public opinion polls.\n\nAfter Mr Leung\u2019s chances of serving a second term were upended by pro-democracy protests in late 2014, the Chinese government wanted Ms Lam to succeed him even though her rival for the job, John Tsang, was more popular with the general public.\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "The Chinese government is drawing up a plan to replace Hong Kong\u2019s leader with an 'interim' chief executive following violent protests against her administration, according to people briefed on the deliberations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.217%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f83a735de6816d0654a186fe3024eb5c016a4c55", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
