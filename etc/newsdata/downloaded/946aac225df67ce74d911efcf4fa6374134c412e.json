This directive, is the latest of a number of measures designed to prevent tax avoidance by large companies, preventing them from exploiting disparities between two or more tax jurisdictions to reduce their overall liability.\u201d\n\nScicluna called this a \u201cbold step\u201d and to reassure businesses also said there would be new proposals in coming months to make sure that corporations will not pay double taxes under the new system.\n\nAgreement on ATAD 2 \u2013 hybrid mismatches at today\u2019s #ECOFIN.\n\n\n\nImportant step forward in tackling tax avoidance. pic.twitter.com/gqAc61H8EU \u2014 EU Tax & Customs (@EU_Taxud) 21 de fevereiro de 2017\n\nBritain is part of this process but the rules will come into effect after it is due to leave the EU and so far there is no commitment from the UK government to stick with them and not shift the economy towards low regulation and taxation.\n\nTax reduction schemes used by Apple, Amazon, Google, Starbucks and other companies are legal under current laws but have fueled public outrage with European governments being deprived of billions in much-needed revenue.\n\nWhat is a tax haven?\n\nThe finance ministers also made progress on defining what is a tax haven so they can compile an EU common list of countries that qualify.\n\nThe setting up of a common list has become more likely after several revelations of massive tax avoidance in countries such as Panama or the Bahamas. EU sanctions could be imposed on countries on the list.\n\nThe list should be finalised by the end of this year. So far, letters have been sent to 92 countries, including the United States, to start a screening of practices that could be seen as facilitating tax avoidance.\n\nSlightly embarrassing for Malta, which holds the current six-month rotating EU presidency, it has been accused of being a tax haven which it has denied.", "description": "European Union finance ministers have agreed new rules to crack down on big multinational companies that are not paying their fair share of tax.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/358539/1000x563_358539.jpg", "published_at": "2017-02-21"}
