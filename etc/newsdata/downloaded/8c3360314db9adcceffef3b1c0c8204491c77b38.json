Every day I went there, there were up to five new bodies,' she told VICE.\n\n'We found that in all the cane toads, the heart and liver had expertly been removed, and the gallbladder, which contains toxic bile salts, had been removed and placed outside the body.'\n\nDr Parrott set up infrared cameras and discovered that local water rats were behind the deaths.\n\nShe said that within just two years of cane toads moving into the region, water rats had figured out how to disable, kill and eat the toads, despite them having killed a number of predators.\n\nDespite not being able to get a close-up of the killing, Dr Parrott believes the rats most likely sliced opened the toad's chests with their teeth - which is less poisonous than their backs.\n\nDr Parrott discovered that water rats are killing cane toads by eating certain parts of them that are free of toxins\n\nShe said the rats would then use their paws to take out the toads' organs.\n\n'They didn't eat as many medium-sized toads, but when they did, it was fascinating to note that as well as the heart and liver they had also eaten one or both of the thigh muscles after stripping away the toxic skin,' she said.\n\n'We're not sure if they just wanted a bigger payoff for their efforts in overpowering the toad, or if it was easier to subdue the toads by holding down the legs first. Interestingly, they never attacked the leg muscles on the larger toads.'", "description": "Reproductive biologist Dr Marissa Parrott discovered that water rats are killing cane toads by eating certain parts of them that are free of toxins.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/12/20031576-0-image-a-26_1571742194908.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
