They see peace when the mom has support from her family \u2013 bc not all new moms do.\n\nBoy killed mom after she gave him vacuum for Christmas then took favorite son to Disney\n\n\u2018They see teenagers giving birth. They see an addicted mom give birth to a baby who is withdrawing.\n\n\u2018They see cps come. They see funeral homes come.\n\n\u2018Did you know that they have to make arrangements for the funeral home to come pick up the baby? I didn\u2019t either.\u2019\n\nLaura posted the photo on Facebook in a bid to raise awareness of how hard nurses work, and highlighted how Caty had worked over 53 hours in four days.\n\nBut Caty, who recently won an award for her hard work, remains modest about the importance of her job, and says she loves the people it allows her to meet.\n\nShe told Good Morning America: \u2018The best part of nursing is making connections with people, being the calm in the storm, being their cheerleader when they need encouragement, and being the shoulder to cry on when they are hurting.\n\n\u2018The worst, though, is knowing that even when you\u2019ve done everything you can for someone, we\u2019re not able to change the outcome (for fetal loss, poor prognosis, etc.); always feeling like you have to be strong for your patient \u2013 when on the inside, you are falling apart.\u2019", "description": "Caty Nixon was overcome with emotion after a particularly punishing shift.
