The relief comes with some caveats, including a provision that the tax avoidance can\u2019t have been willful and a requirement to file six years of tax returns. The program may end in the future, but the IRS hasn\u2019t decided when.\n\nThe IRS said many people eligible for the relief have lived outside the U.S. for most of their lives and may not have realized that they had U.S. tax obligations. They may have become U.S. citizens by being born in the country or because they had American parents.\n\nThe policy applies to people who relinquished their citizenship after March 18, 2010. That is when the U.S. imposed broader reporting requirements on Americans\u2019 offshore accounts, in response to years of tax evasion and bank secrecy.\n\nThe U.S. imposes taxes on all its citizens regardless of where they live. They can get some tax credits for what they pay to foreign governments but still often owe the U.S. That system is different from the rules used by most other countries, which base individual taxes on a person\u2019s residence, not citizenship.\n\nA 2010 law\u2014the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA\u2014made tax compliance more complex for those who knew about their obligations and awakened others to their U.S. tax liabilities. The law effectively imposed penalties on foreign financial institutions that don\u2019t identify which customers are U.S. taxpayers and report their financial-account information to the IRS.\n\nThat led foreign banks to identify the U.S. taxpayers among their customers, and some have shunned U.S. customers altogether. The changes created new hurdles for Americans abroad, making it much more difficult for them to open or maintain accounts. They have pressed Congress to repeal FATCA or switch to residence-based taxation, but those efforts haven\u2019t succeeded.\n\nThe stepped-up U.S. enforcement has prompted some expats to relinquish their citizenship to be free of U.S. tax burdens. This can be a long and expensive process that requires filing six years\u2019 of tax returns and paying back taxes. In some cases, an exit tax is due.\n\nAs a result, many have balked at complying with what they see as heavy-handed laws and enforcement, including some who renounced their citizenship without complying with the tax laws. Friday\u2019s IRS guidance cushions the blow for those \u201caccidental Americans\u201d with minimal U.S. connections and tax burdens along with the willingness to give up their citizenship.\n\n\u201cThis program will help a large number of middle-class Americans living abroad, but it\u2019s unfair to those who already spent time and money to come into compliance, because they can\u2019t take advantage if it,\u201d said John Richardson, a Toronto-based lawyer who advocates for Americans abroad.\n\nWrite to Laura Saunders at laura.saunders@wsj.com and Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service offered a break for some \u2018accidental Americans,\u2019 giving certain expatriates who have renounced their citizenship a chance to escape the U.S. tax system.", "authors": ["Laura Saunders", "Richard Rubin", "Laura.Saunders Wsj.Com", "Richard.Rubin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104891/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
