But, NAFTA is too important to not get done right.\n\nSince the re-negotiated NAFTA was announced late last year, congressional Democrats have urged the administration to remove terms that would lock in high medicines prices and to close loopholes in the new pact\u2019s labor and environmental provisions and strengthen enforcement to counter NAFTA\u2019s ongoing job outsourcing. We also have urged the administration to work with Mexico so that a revised pact translates into improvements on the ground.\n\nThat Democrats are committed to fixing NAFTA is evidenced by the past year of open and respectful dialogue with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer Robert (Bob) Emmet LighthizerOn The Money: Economy adds 164K jobs in July | Trump signs two-year budget deal, but border showdown looms | US, EU strike deal on beef exports Chinese, US negotiators fine-tuning details of trade agreement: report The Trump economy keeps roaring ahead MORE to achieve these changes.\n\nThe House Democratic Caucus has never been more united on trade. We all want to fix NAFTA. We recognize that means the administration must eliminate the new giveaways to Big Pharma that make the new deal worse than the original NAFTA, strengthen labor and environmental standards and enforcement, and secure progress in Mexico on needed changes to accomplish the core mission of fixing NAFTA\u2019s ongoing damage.\n\nThis gave President Trump a clear path to enacting a revised NAFTA despite his repeated provocations on other issues. Yet, for most of this last year, the administration refused to change a single word in last year\u2019s text, even though the last four U.S. trade pacts the Congress enacted all required text changes after they were signed to achieve a majority.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer worked to ensure that renegotiations addressed some of the NAFTA issues of long concern to Democrats. The 2018 election meant Democratic support is necessary to enact the agreement. And in contrast to past pacts, congressional Democrats, unions and consumer groups did not launch a campaign to stop the deal. Instead, we focused on improvements necessary for a new deal to actually counter some of NAFTA\u2019s original sins and not add new ones, namely giving new monopoly powers to Big Pharma to charge consumers more for their medicines.\n\nThe text that President Trump signed obligates NAFTA countries to guarantee extended monopoly rights for pharmaceutical firms so they can block the generic competition that reduces drug prices. These new terms\u2014which were not included in past pacts and that would undermine Democrats\u2019 mission to make medicines affordable for all Americans\u2014are a non-starter.\n\nBut the core goal of re-negotiating NAFTA is to effectively fix the incentives to outsource jobs and pollution.\n\nIn fact, the U.S. International Trade Commission is using the same methodology it employed to project gains from the original NAFTA. Its official assessment of the re-negotiated NAFTA found no economic gains for the United States. Only by including limits on consumer Internet and e-commerce protections did the ITC find a fraction of a percent of gains in GDP, employment, and wages.\n\nNor would the re-negotiated NAFTA fix U.S. farmers\u2019 market access lost due to President Trump\u2019s trade policies or stop future erratic and unpredictable trade actions from the president. Months after he signed his re-negotiated NAFTA, the president threatened to impose new tariffs on all Mexican imports for immigration-related reasons. The re-negotiated NAFTA would not make a dent in replacing the $15 billion in agriculture exports markets lost to tariffs to China in the past year, either.\n\nIt is possible for this Congress to rise above the current Republican partisan gridlock and defeat the influence of pharmaceutical companies to pass an amended NAFTA that works for working people and members of the Congress.\n\nDeLauro represents Connecticut\u2019s 3rd District.", "description": "It is possible for this Congress to rise above the current Republican partisan gridlock and defeat the influence of pharmaceutical companies to pass an amended NAFTA that works for working people and members of the Congress.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/nafta_062519gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
