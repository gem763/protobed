Feeling herself and the \u201ccool photo opportunity,\u201d George positioned her phone on her handbag and posed for selfies like her life depended on it.\n\n\u201cI saw an empty subway car and was alone, so the self-timer had to come out! At the next stop, people got on the train but I decided to continue. It was very spontaneous,\u201d George told HuffPost via email, before adding that the images were initially meant just as \u201csomething for me to post on Twitter for my 200 followers.\u201d\n\nWhile serving looks, George was spotted capturing all of her angles by actor and writer Ben Yahr. Yahr took a nearly one-minute video of the 23-year-old putting in work, which he says happened around 6 p.m. Saturday, and shared the clip on Twitter.\n\nNaturally, it exploded and has more than 30,000 retweets.\n\nThis woman giving it ALL to the selfie cam on the train is SENDING ME pic.twitter.com/i3JoSPKj3I \u2014 Ben Yahr (@benyahr) August 17, 2019\n\nYahr told HuffPost that he \u201cthought it was pretty incredible that someone would be so shameless and also awesome that she was feelin\u2019 herself so hard.\u201d\n\nPeople on Twitter seemed to feel the same exact way, lauding her confidence and praising the way she \u201cbraved bacteria\u201d:\n\nTo have the confidence to do this in front of others is powerful. I could never. \u2014 \u00a1Dale! \ud83d\udc28 (@itsDMCL) August 17, 2019\n\nHonestly she is my new queen, I worship her and ONLY her!! \u2014 Peppa Pig Stan Account (@Neil_McNeil) August 17, 2019\n\nI'm completely focused on her touching that train seat and handlebar and then touching her face and hair. She braved bacteria for a solid selfie and that's the real story here. \u2014 Steelwill (@FCCMandate) August 18, 2019\n\nshe gives zero fucks shes serving \u2014 sarah (@heavenbrat) August 18, 2019\n\nYahr\u2019s viral video ended up reaching George herself, who then responded on Twitter with some of the selfies that resulted from her epic photo shoot. Oh, and George\u2019s follower count has now skyrocketed to more than 20,000.\n\n(Note: The photos are pretty incredible considering the lighting and conditions of an average New York City subway car. We \u2015 and we cannot stress this enough \u2015 must stan.)\n\nGeorge told us that the reaction to her selfies has \u201cbeen absolutely surreal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love the positive feedback and can\u2019t emphasize enough how greatly appreciative I am for everyone\u2019s kind words,\u201d she said, later adding that she\u2019d like to also tell the public that she hopes \u201cwe can all uplift one another as many have done for me already and continue to spread kindness.\u201d\n\nNever stop selfie-ing on the subway, Jess.", "description": "\"She is my new queen,\u201d wrote one person on Twitter about a New Yorker who took the selfie game to a new level over the weekend.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d5a176e2200005500f7a5f9.png?cache=jwyqfboxbq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-08-19"}
