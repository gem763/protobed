That\u2019s the point at which you\u2019d need a spacesuit to survive\u201d.\n\nThe ashes are sent skywards in a mechanism carried by balloon. On-board GPS and a microcontroller tell it when to operate, and at the appropriate moment the ashes are released.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a journey in itself because they\u2019re forming part of the weather system,\u201d says Dr Rose.\n\n\u201cThey will be returning to Earth as snowfall and rainfall.\n\n\u201cWhat better than to go outside when it\u2019s raining or fresh snowfall and be reminded of that person because they are now part of that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt a really nice feeling because he\u2019s everywhere,\u201d says Hazel of her father. \"I can look up at the stars; I can look up at the moon\u2026 I think about him all the time.\u201d", "description": "A British company can release ashes into space.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07mjljf.jpg"}
