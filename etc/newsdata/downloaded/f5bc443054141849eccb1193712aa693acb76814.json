But he makes a point of noting that that criticism went \u201cunchallenged\u201d by the unnamed host.\n\nIs this it? At long last, the \u201cnews vs. opinion\u201d civil war at Fox News turning from cold to hot, triggered by the anger and anxieties surrounding impeachment?\n\nRemember, Shep is also the guy who famously said this last year about his colleagues in Fox\u2019s evening bloc:\n\n\u201cSome of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining,\u201d Smith told Time Magazine\u2019s Daniel D\u2019Addario in a piece titled, \u201cShep Smith Has the Hardest Job on Fox News.\u201d \u201cWe serve different masters,\u201d Smith, 54, added when discussing the difference between the opinion side of Fox News, including shows such as \u201cThe Sean Hannity Show,\u201d and the network\u2019s news division. \u201cWe work for different reporting chains, we have different rules. They don\u2019t really have rules on the opinion side. They can say whatever they want. If it\u2019s their opinion.\u201d\u2026 \u201cI don\u2019t really watch a lot of opinion programming,\u201d Smith continued. \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d\n\nHe seems to view his role on the news side during the Trump era as a corrective to the partisan excesses of his own network\u2019s opinion hosts but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him call out anyone else on the network by name (almost by name, I should say). But Shep would say, I assume, that turnabout is fair play: Tucker and diGenova started this by denigrating one of Fox\u2019s own contributors. If their imperative to defend Trump at all costs now includes dogging Fox personnel on Fox\u2019s own airwaves, well, Smith will behave in like fashion.\n\nTomorrow I half expect to see Hannity burst through the wall of his set like Kool-Aid Man while Shep is on the air and challenge him to a karate match, right then and there.\n\nLoser has to admit that Trump rules/sucks, as the case may be.\n\nThe Shep/Tucker thing wasn\u2019t the only example of Foxies clashing on the air today either.

Law prof Richard Hasen, who specializes in election statutes, addressed that argument a few days ago. Did Trump solicit a \u201cthing of value\u201d from a foreign national, i.e. Zelensky, in pressing him to reopen the Biden probe? Well, arguably, yeah, said Hasen. Napolitano\u2019s not a \u201cfool\u201d for thinking that. Oppo research counts as a \u201cthing of value\u201d and Trump would certainly have had knowledge that this sort of thing was a crime after his Mueller experience. That doesn\u2019t mean he could be successfully prosecuted \u2014 there\u2019s a potential First Amendment defense \u2014 but it\u2019s not batty to think he committed an offense. And just to emphasize the point, Shep himself reads a few opinions in the clip from other former prosecutors who agree. The main argument against Napolitano\u2019s position is a political one, not a legal one: Democrats just aren\u2019t going to convince the public that a president should be removed from office for violating something as byzantine and frequently dubious as campaign finance law. If you want to build support for impeachment, you stick to things which people know in their gut are wrong. Bribery. Extortion. That\u2019s what Democrats would have to prove.\n\nHere\u2019s Shep this afternoon calling out diGenova and Tucker followed by Napolitano\u2019s latest broadside against Trump (in which he does mention bribery). I wonder if Tucker will respond on his own show tonight or if Fox executives have called a team huddle and warned everyone to stop attacking members of the Fox family going forward.\n\n\n\n", "description": "\"Attacking our colleague who's here to offer legal assessments on our air is repugnant.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ss-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
