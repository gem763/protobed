The game\u2018s youthful audience and their parents were apparently so confused they were ringing up Epic\u2019s customer support line to ask why they couldn\u2019t play the game (I hope Epic\u2019s call center employees got combat pay for that).\n\nBut now the new \u201cchapter\u201d of the game is live, so everyone can relax. Epic\u2019s added a (to use a technical term) crapton of new features and gameplay stuff. The map\u2019s also been completely revamped, so the Twitch and Mixer streamers who\u2019ve had the last year to memorize every inch of in-game real estate will have to start fresh.\n\nSome of the new material brings to mind other games. The most obvious reference I noticed is the fact that you can now hide in haystacks, kind of like OG Assassin\u2019s Creed. Fortnite also now has a crafting system, in which players can use resources gathered from around the map to upgrade their weapons \u2014 kinda similar to a smaller battle royale game called Realm Royale.\n\nOther additions include the ability to carry wounded comrades to safety (which is a pleasant enough addition), a gun that shoots bandages (which somehow heals you, because game logic), and fishing (which I didn\u2019t know I wanted but by golly, I want it now). There\u2019s also a new progression system via the battle pass that involves earning medals to get more XP (if you\u2019ve played Overwatch \u2014 kinda like that).\n\nFortnite adding new content isn\u2019t exactly new: the game was practically unrecognizable from its original form even before it got sucked into a black hole. The fact that the update is comparatively large is probably the reason the game was offline for a good length of time.\n\nGotta hand it to Fortnite, though. That\u2019s a heck of a way to disguise some map maintenance as something significant. I mean, really, all that happened was that Fortnite went offline to update and we had to find other ways of occupying ourselves for a bit. But because of all the sturm und drang, the eschatological drama that accompanied it, it really felt like something happened.\n\nAnd now that I\u2019m on a relatively even playing field with all the people who never stopped playing \u2014 who wants to help me get back into Fortnite?\n\nPeople who know better, tell me this: Is this hard reset a good time to get back into Fortnite? I'm asking for a friend. Me, I'm the friend. \u2014 Rachel Kaser (@rachelkaser) October 15, 2019\n\nFortnite Chapter 2 on Epic Games\n\nRead next: TikTok appears to have walked back its 'shadow ban' on Trump posts", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FFortnite-ch-2.jpg&signature=749bcebc3942c9d64e38fba4b3bd9c0b", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
