Published before the early morning prorogation, the paper says the latest parliamentary vote defeat is a \u201cfresh setback\u201d for the PM. It also carries the Lib Dem leader\u2019s vow to revoke article 50, as the party positions itself as the most pro-EU ahead of possible election.\n\nAlison Rourke (@AlisonRourke) The Guardian's front page 10/9/19: \"Six votes, six defeat as PM loses bid for snap election\" pic.twitter.com/wYoH0WLhGz\n\nThe Telegraph\u2019s headline is: \u201cSpeaker aims to have last word on his successor\u201d, with the paper saying Bercow will go on 31 October \u201cbut not before trying to ensure Remainer Commons chooses his replacement\u201d.\n\nThe Telegraph (@Telegraph) The front page of tomorrow's Daily Telegraph: 'Speaker aims to have last word on his successor' #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/AxumtZ5bYp\n\nThe early edition of the FT also carries a picture of Bercow: \u201cSpeaking out: Bercow stands up for Commons as he moves to step down\u201d.\n\nThe Times carries a picture of Bercow under the headline: \u201cMPs stop Johnson for calling October election\u201d. Also published before the parliament was prorogued, the paper says the five-week suspension means an election cannot be held until the second half of November at the earliest, as MPs won\u2019t sit again until 14 October.\n\nAlison Rourke (@AlisonRourke) The Times' front page 10/9/19 pic.twitter.com/OS7WDNfZa1\n\nThe paper also reserves a front page column for \u201cMay honours \u2018terrible twins\u2019 blamed for Tory failure\u201d, about the CBEs given to her former joint chiefs of staff Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, \u201cdespite being forced to quit after the Conservatives lost their majority in 2017\u201d.\n\nThe Mirror also focusses on May, with the headline \u201cNo shame\u201d, saying \u201cas parliament is suspended over the Brexit crisis, Theresa May has the audacity to reward the bungling advisers who got us in this mess\u201d. It says she has awarded titles to 41 allies, including those who have led the parliament to being suspended.\n\nDaily Mirror (@DailyMirror) Today's front page: No shame#TomorrowsPapersToday https://t.co/zP0OEkL5Qt pic.twitter.com/5FOXkhuGnX\n\nThe Express admires Johnson\u2019s stance on Brexit: \u201cBoris blasts Brexit \u2018Yellow Bellies\u2019\u201d, adding \u201cMPs savaged for \u2018outrageous\u2019 excuses over stalling election. It also got on its front page the PM\u2019s claim that \u201cdefiance of referendum is costing country \u20ac250m a week\u201d. On its page 4-5 spread, it says the \u201cfrustrated PM\u201d will not ask for another Brexit delay, while carrying a picture of Nigel Farage with the headline: \u201cFarage insists party won\u2019t stand against no-deal Tory candidates\u201d.\n\nAlison Rourke (@AlisonRourke) Daily Express front page 10/9/19 pic.twitter.com/8AV7e4bN1X\n\nThe Sun does not splash Brexit, instead reserving its lead for the \u201cshock rise in pill addicts as docs prescribe to 11.5m\u201d, while running a smaller Brexit headline: \u201cEnd of the Berc show\u201d.", "description": "Front pages focus on Boris Johnson\u2019s defeats, the Speaker\u2019s resignation and parliament being prorogued", "authors": ["Alison Rourke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/171c332b770ef2208e2712f36c68b10ae12055b1/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a9096215cb6aca4f7d79e76ce07c5c9c", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
