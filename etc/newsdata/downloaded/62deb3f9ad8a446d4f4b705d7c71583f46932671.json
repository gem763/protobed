We included established companies as well as startups.\n\nWe also aimed to put together a diverse group of people, both in the range of titles and responsibilities and in the challenges they're facing. They include measuring marketing spend and preparing for privacy regulation.\n\nThe rise of Amazon is reflected in this list too. Retailers are increasingly balancing selling their products on Amazon and their own e-commerce sites, and several companies highlighted help retailers navigate issues like fake reviews, logistics, and advertising.\n\nHere are the 22 martech executives to know, listed alphabetically.", "description": "From cloud giants to a growing crop of startups, these are the people leading the future of marketing technology.", "authors": ["Lauren Johnson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daf6664cc4a0a603439ff07?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
