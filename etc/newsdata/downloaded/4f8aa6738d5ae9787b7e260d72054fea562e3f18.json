(Reuters) - When Donald Trump won the White House, the sprawling aluminum smelter that hugs the Ohio River here was operating at less than half its capacity, and most of its skeleton crew of 270 remaining workers were fearful about their future.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump rallies with supporters in Dallas, Texas, U.S. October 17, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nBut Trump\u2019s tariffs have saved it, at least for now.\n\nHow a tiny industry - only 4,000 U.S. workers are directly involved in making primary aluminum currently - won protection is a testament to savvy lobbying, and one firm\u2019s ability to get the Trump administration to view it as a sector that would soon be gone without a government intervention.\n\nCentury Aluminum Co, which operates the Hawesville smelter and ranks as the second-largest aluminum maker in the United States, spearheaded the fight. Almost everyone else that touches the metal, from the industry\u2019s main trade association and consuming businesses from beer maker MillerCoors to Alcoa Corp - the country\u2019s largest aluminum maker - were staunchly opposed to tariffs.\n\nU.S. aluminum prices are based on a global benchmark\u2014with a premium added on in the US to cover transportation and insurance. Since last year, the premium has included the 10% Trump tariff. Century and other domestic producers don\u2019t pay the tariff, but still charge the same premium, giving them a pricing edge.\n\nBut what is good for Century hurts most other parts of the industry. Automaker General Motors Co estimated metal tariffs would add $1 billion to its costs in 2019. Heavy equipment maker Deere & Co laid off 163 workers in Illinois and Iowa as the trade war drove up its costs and at the same time hurt demand for tractors from farmers facing diminished exports.\n\nThe fight between Century and almost every other firm in the aluminum industry underscores a divergence that has occurred over the last two decades. Many sectors of the U.S. aluminum business are thriving, including processors who take raw aluminum and shape it into parts for everything from airplanes to washing machines.\n\nBut makers of primary metal - its most basic form - have struggled.\n\nThe United States was once the world\u2019s biggest producer of primary aluminum. But by the time Trump took office, production had dwindled to the level last seen in 1951 and capacity utilization, a gauge of industry health, stood at just 37%. There were only five operating primary aluminum smelters left, down from 23 in 2001.\n\nWhat hobbled the business was a combination of energy prices, new technology and globalization.\n\nThe drastically diminished U.S. footprint of primary aluminum helps explain how the industry was able to make its case for protection, say industry leaders, trade attorneys who fought for the tariffs, and analysts who track the business.\n\nCentury, based in Chicago, began its fight in 2015 when it hired the Washington law firm Wiley Rein LLP to help it press for protection. The company had already announced plans to shutter the Hawesville plant entirely, but opted instead to cut output to a fraction of its potential as it waited to see how its case would play out, company executives told Reuters.\n\nThe Obama administration filed a case with the World Trade Organization during its last week in office, accusing China of unfairly subsidizing its aluminum industry and harming domestic producers like Century. But by then, a new wind of protection was blowing in Washington, and Century saw the chance to tie its case closely to other basic industries seeking tariffs, particularly steel.\n\nCentury\u2019s lobbyists emphasized that unlike steel, which still produces about 80% of U.S. needs at domestic plants, primary aluminum smelters were on the brink of disappearing entirely. They found a receptive audience at the Commerce Department, said Jesse Gary, Century\u2019s general counsel.\n\nCentury also emphasized its unique role as the only U.S. operation that can make metal needed for military equipment like advanced armor used to shield Humvees and other military vehicles. \u201cWe\u2019re the only volume producer of high purity aluminum in the Western Hemisphere and among NATO allies,\u201d said Gary, adding that other main sources are China, Russia and the Middle East.\n\nA spokesman for the Commerce Department confirmed that steel was a far bigger target for their investigation into the case for tariffs on imported metals. \u201cBut in terms of fragility of the industry, relatively speaking, aluminum was in a worse position than steel,\u201d said the spokesman, given the low capacity utilization.\n\nIndustry giant Alcoa has argued that tariffs are the wrong way to address the problem facing domestic smelters, which is low global prices of primary aluminum caused by massive overproduction by China. The company has acknowledged tariffs have helped its remaining U.S. smelters. Speaking to investors in April, Alcoa CEO Roy Harvey said \u201ctariffs have not solved the industry\u2019s challenges, which stem from high subsidized smelting capacity in China that has resulted in surplus production.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Century\u2019s Hawesville plant has become a poster child for tariffs. After the tariffs were announced last year, the company said it would spend $150 million modernizing and reopening parts of the plant, moves that will eventually lead to a doubling of the workforce to over 600.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross famously downplayed concerns about metal tariffs hurting consumers by going on CNBC holding a can of Campbell\u2019s soup and saying the tax would barely register in the cost of such goods. Ross last year attended a ribbon-cutting at the gritty, smoke-filled Hawesville plant, where he reassured workers that the protection would not be fleeting.\n\nTariffs are a frequent topic of conversation here for workers on the factory floor, where work is underway to restart production lines. Greg Lester, who came out of retirement last year to help train new workers being hired at the plant, said he considers it almost a miracle that this mill did not die like all the others he has worked for.\n\nLester notes that he spent much of his four-decade career helping U.S. companies build smelters in other countries, while smelters back home fell like dominos.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in West Africa, I\u2019ve taught Russians how to make super-pure aluminum,\u201d said Lester. \u201cThe only place that didn\u2019t seem to want smelters was the U.S.\u201d\n\nOne place where the tariffs are viewed a bit more skeptically is the storefront near Hawesville occupied by United Steelworkers local 9423, which represents workers at the plant.\n\nAndy Meserve, president of the union, said workers have welcomed the investments and new jobs. They recognize that tariffs could hurt other parts of the aluminum industry.\n\n\u201cBut it was great for Hawesville,\u201d he said.", "description": "When Donald Trump won the White House, the sprawling aluminum smelter that hugs the Ohio River here was operating at less than half its capacity, and most of its skeleton crew of 270 remaining workers were fearful about their future.", "authors": ["Timothy Aeppel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442252194&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0X3", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
