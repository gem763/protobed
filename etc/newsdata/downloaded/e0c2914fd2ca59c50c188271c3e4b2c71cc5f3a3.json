But close behind him is Ibrahimovic, the enigmatic Swede who stars for the rival LA Galaxy, with 29 goals and a four-game scoring streak.\n\nIbrahimovic, who turned 38 this week, suggested that the only reason Vela has more goals is because he\u2019s played in more games.\n\n\u201cI have 29 goals in 28 games. If I would have the same amount (of) games like the other ones, it would be different,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now I\u2019m chasing someone that has more games than me. But if we score we score, we\u2019ll have to see what the end number will be. We\u2019ll see. If there still is a possibility, we\u2019ll try.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d rather have the victory, anyway.\n\n\u201cI prefer the collective win,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we win that game, that is more important. Then with the collective success, the individual success comes with it.\u201d\n\nThe Galaxy will play the Dynamo in Houston to try and secure home-field advantage in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nLAFC\u2019s game at home against the Colorado Rapids figures into more than just the Golden Boot race. The Supporters\u2019 Shield winners could set the single-season record for points (71), set by the Red Bulls last year. LAFC, which has already secured a bye for the first round, has 69 points going into the match.\n\nAdditionally, LAFC has scored 82 goals this season, three goals away from the MLS single-season record set by the Galaxy in 1998.\n\nA win Sunday is also important to the Rapids, who are still fighting for their first playoff appearance since 2016, but they\u2019ll need help from results in other matches to rise above the line. Colorado is playing under new coach Robin Fraser, who was hired in late August.\n\nFour teams are vying for the final two playoff sports in the Western Conference when Decision Day\u2019s 12 matches kick off simultaneously on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe Portland Timbers are currently in sixth in the standings with 46 points, followed by FC Dallas with 45, San Jose with 44 and Colorado with 42. In addition to the Rapids match in Los Angeles, Dallas hosts Sporting Kansas City, which has already been eliminated.\n\nThe Timbers and the Earthquakes go head-to-head in Portland, with a win assuring a berth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a must win. That\u2019s all it is,\u201d said Portland defender Zarek Valentin. \u201cThe focus starts now because we know that we control our own destiny in terms of winning and getting in and that\u2019s all you can ask for at the end of the year. Obviously, we wish we could be a little bit higher, but we believe in ourselves and luckily it\u2019s in our hands. We\u2019ve just got to get out there, get some points and get in the playoffs.\u201d\n\nJust like the teams in the West are still jockeying to play at home in the opening round, a similar scramble is happening in the Eastern Conference. D.C. United, the New York Red Bulls and Toronto FC each have the opportunity to finish in fourth.\n\nThe final standings took on greater weight under the league\u2019s new playoff format. MLS shortened its season by a month this year, going to single-elimination playoffs and setting the MLS Cup final on Nov. 10 - its earliest finish since 2002. Because the league expanded to 24 teams, MLS also expanded the playoffs to include 14 teams, seven from each conference.\n\nThe all-knockout postseason replaces the two-leg format for the conference semifinals and finals that the league started using in 2003.\n\nIn making the change, MLS Commissioner Don Garber said the new format rewards top regular-season records because they\u2019ll get greater home-field advantage. The shorter season will also ensure down the road that MLS wraps up before the start of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, set to start on Nov. 21.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Major League Soccer is bracing for Sunday's annual Decision Day, the final day of the season when teams scramble - all at the same time - for playoff spots and position.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
