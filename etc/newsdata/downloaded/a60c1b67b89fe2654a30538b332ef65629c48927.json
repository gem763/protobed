On Thursday, the Islamic State boasted of a fresh release of captives following a reported assault on an SDF base near Raqqa, the group\u2019s former capital. That attack killed six Kurdish fighters and led to the \u201cfreeing of multiple Muslim women,\u201d according to a statement issued by the Islamic State\u2019s media arm. The incident was said to have occurred in Mahmudli, a village near a large refugee camp for displaced Syrians.\n\nPro-Islamic State social media sites are exulting over the rapid turn of events, and prominent commentators are calling for fresh attacks on prisons to free thousands of Islamist militants held by Kurdish forces. Hundreds of Islamic State family members and a handful of fighters are believed to have escaped from SDF-run detention camps amid the turmoil of the past week.\n\n\u201cPrison breaks are happening. The imminent return of the Islamic State is assured by the command of Allah,\u201d one commentator declared in a pro-Islamic State forum on the social media site Telegram. The writer cited the escapes as evidence that extremist militants are \u201ctaking advantage of the war between the Kurds and the Turks.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTurkey\u2019s military offensive in northern Syria has triggered a spike in Islamic State attacks against the SDF, which is scrambling to defend its strongholds against an air and ground assault by Turkish troops and Turkish-backed militias. Islamic State websites reported 27 successful or attempted attacks against the SDF in the week following the invasion, compared with an average of 10 attacks over each of the previous three weeks, according to a tally by SITE.\n\nSDF officials have acknowledged the increase in violence, which included a double suicide bombing this week at a restaurant in the border town of Qamishli that killed three people and wounded nine others.\n\nOn pro-Islamic State message boards, supporters of the terrorist group said the attacks were partial revenge for the deaths of thousands of militants and the destruction of the caliphate, which occupied nearly half of Syria before being driven to collapse by SDF fighters backed by U.S. warplanes and Special Forces operators. One anonymous post claimed that it was easier to carry out attacks because Kurdish forces are preoccupied with defending towns and villages against the Turkish forces.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe chaos is allowing brothers to plant IEDs [roadside bombs] more freely\u201d because there are fewer SDF fighters around to stop them, it said. A translation of the Arabic postings was provided by SITE.\n\nWhile a weakened force in Syria, the Islamic State regards the eastern half of the country \u2014 including Raqqa \u2014 as \u201ccritical ground,\u201d Katz said.\n\nAt the very least, the terrorist group appears to be seizing opportunities to project itself as vital and active, European and Middle Eastern officials said.\n\n\u201cThey would be stupid not to exploit it and give the impression \u2014 even if it\u2019s just an impression \u2014 that they are regaining some kind of strength,\u201d said a European security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments.\n\nAD\n\nU.S. and European intelligence officials had warned of a possible Islamic State resurgence in the aftermath of the invasion, which Turkey says is intended to prevent the border region from becoming a haven for anti-\n\nTurkish terrorists. Turkish tanks and warplanes crossed into Syria three days after the Trump administration announced that it was withdrawing a few dozen U.S. troops and Special Forces operators from the area.\n\nAD\n\nTurkey regards the SDF as an armed branch of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, a militant group that seeks self-rule for ethnic Kurds.\n\nThe SDF was an essential U.S. ally in the fight against the caliphate and has continued to battle Islamic State cells while maintaining prisons and detention camps housing tens of thousands of fighters and their family members, many of them foreign nationals.\n\nAD\n\nThere has been scant information about conditions in the camps over the past week, but Kurdish officials have independently confirmed that nearly 800 people escaped from a facility for Islamic State family members in the Kurdish town of Ain Issa, a breakout that \u201coccurred following Turkish shelling,\u201d according to a report Tuesday by the pro-SDF Rojava Information Center.\n\nThe center said five male Islamic State fighters escaped from a second detention camp as inmates were being transferred to another facility. Their whereabouts remained unknown.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe situation grows increasingly tense and unstable as more [Kurdish] security forces are moved to the front,\u201d the report said. It claimed that Islamic State supporters detonated a car bomb outside a third facility in an apparent attempt to free inmates inside.\n\nAD\n\nA new analysis by a Belgian think tank estimates that 12,000 Islamic State fighters and family members are in SDF custody. The latter group includes about 430 adults and 700 children from European countries, according to the report by the Egmont Royal Institute for International Relations.\n\nEscapees from Kurdish facilities could eventually make their way back to their home countries, said Thomas Renard, an Egmont senior research fellow.\n\n\u201cSome fighters will escape and others will be released,\u201d perhaps deliberately, he said. While some may be recaptured or killed, others might follow the path of comrades who were smuggled into southern Turkey and continued to travel north.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat some returned undetected cannot be excluded,\u201d he said, \u201cnor can it be excluded in the current chaos.\u201d\n\nTerrorism experts say the prospect of further escapes has generated particular excitement among Islamists because of the prominent role played by prisons in several of the most storied episodes in the Islamic State\u2019s history. The terrorist group\u2019s rise in 2013 gained momentum after militants stormed Iraq\u2019s notorious Abu Ghraib prison in July of that year, freeing some 500 inmates, including dozens of terrorists on death row. A year later, the group controlled a swath of territory across Iraq and Syria the size of Britain.\n\nIslamic State chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi spent nearly a year in Camp Bucca, a U.S. detention camp in southern Iraq that served as a kind of training and recruitment center for the terrorist group he would eventually lead.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a mythology surrounding the liberation of the Muslim inmate,\u201d said Jesse Morton, a former extremist and co-founder of Parallel Networks, a nonprofit group that seeks to combat online radicalization. \u201cThey\u2019re spinning it online, because prisons have always been a key part of their propaganda. What is happening now in Syria is their Camp Bucca.\u201d", "description": "Terrorist group celebrates prison breaks, expands attacks as foes are beaten back.", "authors": ["National Security Reporter Covering Terrorism", "Rogue States", "Weapons Proliferation", "Souad Mekhennet", "Reporter Covering National Security", "Middle East", "North Africa", "Terrorism"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DCkjoFSyfSGWrXKR7kgRu9xFn9Q=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KTV4CDXRE4I6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
