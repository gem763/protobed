Officials don\u2019t know what about the products are harmful, \u201cbut we\u2019re seeing THC as a marker for products that are risky,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is also becoming clearer that the surge in cases in recent months is not the result of better recognition of an existing disease, but \u201csomething riskier that is in much more frequent use,\u201d she said. Schuchat cited the use of cutting agents that are added to THC-containing products to increase profit, and the increased availability of online videos that may have \u201cskyrocketed\u201d do-it-yourself instructions.\n\nOne substance that has turned up in many product samples is vitamin E oil, known as vitamin E acetate. Experts in the legal marijuana industry have said it has been added to THC oil used to fill vape cartridges. Vitamin E acetate, which is sold legally, is commonly used as a nutritional supplement and in skin-care products. It\u2019s not harmful when ingested or applied to the skin. But health officials warn it could be hazardous when inhaled, potentially causing the sorts of symptoms many patients have reported: cough, shortness of breath and chest pain.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration, which is testing more than 900 samples of products and devices, is also investigating the supply chain of potential illicit vaping products. FDA is working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials at international mail facilities to trace how products entered the U.S. marketplace, said Mitch Zeller, director of FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products. He declined to provide specifics.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs of Oct. 22, the CDC and local officials have confirmed 35 deaths among at least 1,604 cases of vaping-related injuries in every state except Alaska as well as in the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to the CDC.\n\nThe median age of patients who have died is 45, and 23 for those who survived.\n\nFor patients who have died, officials and clinicians have not always been able to obtain a full history of what they used and for how long. Schuchat said CDC has the exposure history for about 19, roughly half, of the patients who died.\n\nWhile cases are still being reported, the latest data suggests cases may be leveling off or declining. But Schuchat cautioned it was too early to know whether that is what is happening. State officials may be pursuing investigations less intensively, or delayed in reporting data, or enforcement actions may be affecting the supply chain in parts of the country, she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also possible that warnings about THC are having an effect,\u201d she said. As part of what she described as a \u201ccall to action\u201d to the nation\u2019s youth, the CDC is hoping young people listen to the voices of those who have experienced injuries first-hand and are quitting vaping, she said.\n\nCDC officials are continuing to recommend that people refrain from using all e-cigarette and vaping products although the majority of people who have fallen ill used products containing THC and no specific component or substance has yet been determined as the cause.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The latest data adds to evidence pointing to products containing the marijuana, especially products obtained illicitly, as the source of injury.", "authors": ["Lena H.
