And as I wrote last week, it poses perhaps the gravest threat to Trump\u2019s presidency to date. After months spent resisting the growing ranks of pro-impeachment lawmakers in her caucus, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced today that she\u2019s authorizing a formal impeachment inquiry to begin. \u201cThe president must be held accountable,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d\n\nInstances of Trump using the office to serve himself are coming with more frequency. In recent weeks, he\u2019s brazenly promoted his commercial interests and targeted California, a stronghold of anti-Trump sentiment.\n\n\u201cWhat frightened me in his first couple of years was his ignorance,\u201d John Dean, who was White House counsel under former President Richard Nixon and who famously warned his boss that the Watergate scandal amounted to a \u201ccancer on the presidency,\u201d told me. \u201cWhat frightens me now is, he is learning how things work and how they can be abused.\u201d\n\nTrump is no longer a neophyte on the world stage. He\u2019s been to multiple summit meetings, he\u2019s developed personal relationships with a raft of foreign leaders, and he seems surer of both his message and his methods. Earlier today, Trump gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, a body that symbolizes a multinational approach to common problems, and derided the whole project. \u201cThe future does not belong to globalists,\u201d he said, speaking in a flat monotone throughout the nearly 40-minute address. \u201cThe future belongs to patriots \u2026 Globalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders, causing them to ignore their own national interests. But as far as America is concerned, those days are over.\u201d\n\nAt an early point in his presidency, a strong, internationally minded faction inside the White House might have edited out that line or tempered it, lest he leave the impression that America is abandoning the post\u2013World War II architecture of trade pacts and alliances that it helped create. \u201cHey, I\u2019m a globalist and I\u2019m a nationalist,\u201d Trump told me in an interview in 2017.\n\nNo more, it seems. Surrounded by aides inclined to reinforce his gut instincts, Trump is acting more on his own, defining the agenda on his terms. And it\u2019s getting him into more and more trouble, as the impeachment threat shows. It\u2019s not clear what, if any, White House protocols were followed during Trump\u2019s call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July, when he reportedly invoked Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination who could face off with Trump in November 2020. But when Trump told Zelensky an alleged eight times that he wanted Biden and his son Hunter investigated, either none of the aides listening on the White House\u2019s end tried to object or, if they did, Trump ignored them.", "description": "He\u2019s finding ever more risky ways to advance his personal agenda.", "authors": ["Peter Nicholas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX74EKG/facebook.jpg?1569356018", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
