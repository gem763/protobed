Each winning charity will receive a $2,500 grant to apply to a project or program that will enhance the lives of rural residents.\n\nThe Bayer Fund is a non-profit organization dedicated to strengthening the communities where Bayer customers and employees live and work by providing funding for food and nutrition, education and community development projects.\n\n\u201cThere is so much need in rural Canada to replace aging infrastructure and provide valuable programs and services that are important to farmers, their families and other rural residents,\u201d said Trish Jordan, public & industry affairs director with Bayer\u2019s Crop Science division. \u201cThis program is just one way we can give back and help these groups improve the quality of life in their communities.\u201d\n\nFirst introduced in 2012, this year\u2019s CFGC program received almost 1,000 applications and charity suggestions, similar in scope to 2018. Participation rates have risen considerably over the past two years which points to both interest among farmers in giving back to their communities, and the significant need among charitable and community groups.\n\nThe program received many suggestions from farmers on how local groups in their communities could benefit from the grants. Farmers recommended schools, libraries, historical societies, health and recreational facilities, rural daycares, seniors\u2019 clubs, 4-H groups, food banks and more. Some examples:\n\nHigh Prairie Health Care Auxiliary in High Prairie, AB. - \u201cWe are most grateful to the Benoit family for their support in nominating us and being such advocates for improved hospital services in our community. It is only through such kindness and programs such as this that we can continue to work towards meeting the health care needs of this region.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n- \u201cWe are most grateful to the Benoit family for their support in nominating us and being such advocates for improved hospital services in our community.

We are so thankful for this grant which will support equipment purchases and other programs. We plan a seasonal display about agriculture and the funds will be very well used!\u201d\n\nCaledonia Agricultural Society in Caledonia, ON. \u2013 \u201cWe have embarked on a multi-million-dollar renovation of our exhibition facility to include space for a new agri-education room and a teaching kitchen where we plan to emphasize farm-to-table. It will be a hot spot year-round for our small community.\u201d\n\nAbove & Beyond Animal and Community Wellness Centre in Kingston, NS. \u2013 \u201cThis funding will be used to support educational and promotional campaigns to increase awareness of the many beneficial and therapeutic effects of the 'human animal bond.'\u201d\n\nFarmers living and working in the Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Northeastern B.C. had from mid-January to the end of September to submit their entries by visiting the Canada\u2019s Farmers website and completing an online application form.\n\nTo read more community stories or gather additional information about Canada\u2019s Farmers Grow Communities visit www.canadasfarmers.ca or follow on Twitter @CanadasFarmers.\n\nAbout Bayer\n\nBayer is a global enterprise with core competencies in the life science fields of health care and nutrition.
