He made it in a 3-1 loss to Manchester City in January 2006.\n\nAt half-time, with United trailing 2-0, Sir Alex Ferguson took him to one side and said: 'You aren't ready for this, son. Sit down, and watch what the Premier League is all about.'\n\nHe substituted Evra at the break, but we know what a fine left back he went on to become for Fergie's United. He came good eventually, winning five titles in England and the Champions League.\n\nChristian Pulisic used his frustration to perform excellently at Turf Moor and score three\n\nThis brings me to Christian Pulisic. I was at Turf Moor on Saturday to see the American start in the Premier League for the first time since August, and he scored a perfect hattrick.\n\nLeft foot, right foot, head, win confirmed for Chelsea, job done.\n\nBefore introducing himself against Burnley, Pulisic's ability was being questioned. The critics were out in force, apparently because he had not had the impact they expected.\n\nThat frustrated me. In this country, we seem to like judging a player before he gets a proper chance to show us what he is all about.\n\nIt was the American's first professional hat-trick and he initially forget to take the match ball\n\nJust because Pulisic cost \u00a358million, or because he is seen as a superstar in the United States, does not mean we should expect him to arrive in England and rip it up from the get-go. It takes time.\n\nHe has to get to know the Premier League first. Just like Evra did for United. Just like Fabinho has done for Liverpool. After signing the midfielder for \u00a339m in the summer of 2018, Jurgen Klopp gave him time.\n\nNow, the 26-year-old is one of the best No 6s out there. He is crucial to the league leaders, having appeared in every Liverpool game this season, except when he was rested for their Carabao Cup clash with MK Dons.\n\nFrank Lampard knows what he is doing with Pulisic, too. He is taking care of the 21-year-old forward. The American is obviously keen to impress \u2013 he cut short his summer holidays so he could get to Chelsea and impress his new boss as soon as possible \u2013 but there is no rush.\n\nFrank Lampard punched the air in joy after seeing the summer signing destroy Burnley\n\nThe same goes for Nicolas Pepe at Arsenal. Yes the Frenchman cost a club record \u00a372m but can we not give him time before branding him a flop or bad buy? To write the 24-year-old off after a few months is ludicrous and downright unfair.\n\nI believe Pepe will come good, and I think Pulisic will, too. You learn a lot about a player's personality when you speak to him after a match.\n\nBefore meeting Pulisic for the first time on Saturday, after he agreed to join us for a pitchside chat on Sky, I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew how huge he was in America, so would he be confident? Arrogant?\n\nYet after speaking to him, I left with the impression that this is a nice, mild-mannered boy. He was quiet, shy almost. He even had to be told by his team-mates to collect the match ball, because it was his first-ever professional hat-trick!\n\nLet's give Pulisic the time he deserves and see how far he can go.\n\nSpurs lost... but they didn't wave the white flag\n\nI've watched a lot of Tottenham this season and, though they lost 2-1, what I enjoyed about their performance at Anfield was the effort they put in.\n\nToo many times this season they have looked like a team waving a white flag. Under Mauricio Pochettino they have travelled away 27 times to face a fellow Big Six side \u2013 and secured only three wins.\n\nTottenham ultimately could not take anything from Anfield but did not wave the white flag\n\nBut against the league leaders on Sunday, they at least showed a bit of grit.\n\nI'm not saying this was them turning a corner, but we finally saw some of their players having a go. It was a silly mistake by Serge Aurier that cost Spurs in the end.\n\nHe caught the back of Sadio Mane's leg and gave away a cheap penalty. Aurier comes with that element of risk and it denied them a result at Liverpool.\n\nFoxes have fallen back in love with football\n\nI got the sense that Leicester's players had fallen out of love with the game under their previous manager, Claude Puel.\n\nFor whatever reason, they weren't enjoying their football. The buzz was not there, but it has returned since Brendan Rodgers took charge of the Foxes.\n\nLeicester are in scintillating form and look like a side who have fallen in love with football again\n\nOne of the biggest compliments we can pay Leicester is that they sold their star defender to Manchester United for \u00a380million in the summer and yet we have barely noticed the absence of Harry Maguire. They have just got on with it.\n\nAnyone who has read this column before will know the admiration I have for Rodgers. When you meet him, you realise what a truly talented football man he is.\n\nLeicester's ruthless 9-0 demolition of Southampton is another clear sign of his influence at that club. The players love playing for him.\n\nSilva should be seething with VAR\n\nMarco Silva has every right to be angry with the decision of VAR to award Brighton a pivotal penalty in their 3-2 defeat of Everton at the Amex Stadium.\n\nMichael Keane did step on Aaron Connolly's foot, but let's be honest, that was extremely harsh.\n\nEspecially when you think of some of the other calls which have not been given, like when Bournemouth's Jefferson Lerma stood on David Silva's foot at the Vitality Stadium in August. Where is the consistency?\n\nMarco Silva looked like a troubled man on the touchline as Everton lost to Brighton\n\nWilder's belief in Mousset is showing\n\nIn 58 Premer League games for Bournemouth, Lys Mousset scored three goals. He has now equalled that total in seven appearances for Sheffield United.\n\nChris Wilder clearly believes in his ability, and having that backing is big for a striker. It's like in any job. If your boss doesn't rate you, then you're bound to struggle.\n\nYet Wilder believes his \u00a310million man can help them stay in the top flight.\n\nLys Mousset is repaying the faith shown in him by Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder", "description": "JAMIE REDKNAPP: Patrice Evra told me an interesting story last week about his Manchester United debut.
