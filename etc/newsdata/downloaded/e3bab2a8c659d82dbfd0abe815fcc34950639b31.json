Do you that\u2019s going to help or hurt the president?\n\nANDREW CARD: I think it\u2019s the president\u2019s duty not to speak in hyperbole. I actually took his comment about China as a little bit frivolous and baiting.\n\nJACKSON: I\u2019m surprised to hear you say that because I don\u2019t know many people who read it the same way. The president seemed awfully serious when he made those remarks.\n\nCARD: I think this president speaks with hyperbole far too much. I\u2019ve called him a carnival barker. He wants you to come in the freakshow. I don\u2019t always agree with what he says and how he says it. I wish he would be more careful with the language he uses, the tweets he sends out. But, I do think an impeachment inquiry is warranted. Clearly, lines have been crossed.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an impeachable offense yet, we don\u2019t know yet because most people in Congress have already made up their mind when they haven\u2019t seen any evidence. I want people to calm down, take a look at it. Don\u2019t call a molehill a mountain. They tend to do that. There\u2019s hyperbole on both sides. This is a serious process\u2026 I do want the impeachment process if it\u2019s going to go forward to be done deliberately without hyperbole, without exaggeration, based on the facts", "description": "Andrew Card expressed support for the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump over his call with the leader of Ukraine.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/Adam-Schiff-Getty-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
