And the Live HDR+ on the Pixel 4's make the good, better. However, iPhone 11 and 11 Pro's cameras too get Smart HDR that tries to bring this same sorcery to its photos, with some really stunning results.\n\nPixel has Night Sight, iPhone 11/11 Pro has Auto Night Mode\n\nNight Sight on Pixel phones has been truly amazing to capture images in low-light. However, iPhone 11's have also brought in Night Mode on its camera that detects the light on the subject and captures images with longer-exposed shots that look just as good, and in some cases, better. Sure, iPhones can't do astrophotography like the Pixel 4, but being in a city engulfed with smog or clouds, where would we get a chance to do that anyway?\n\nA better front camera on the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro\n\nWhile Pixel gets a single 8-megapixel shooter at the front, the iPhone 11/11 Pro gets a 12-megapixel sensor, that can capture some sharp and crisp selfies. What's more, is that you can also capture slow-motion selfies or slofies, if you wanted to, along with the ability to capture selfie portraits, similar to Pixel 4's.\n\nA better video camera\n\niPhones in the past have been splendid with their video-recording capabilities, and with multiple lenses on the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, it just got better. The camera are capable of shooting at 4K resolution with butter-smooth 60fps. Both Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 devices haven't done as well as the iPhones in this department.\n\nApple\n\nFrom smooth stabilisation to a seamless switch between lenses while shooting, it gives the creator a ton of flexibility to get the best shot. The iPhone 11 Pros also give you the ability to edit your captured footage right on the smartphone, without the need of any third-party app.\n\nIn conclusion, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max seem to be the best camera smartphones you can buy in India right now that would deliver similar if not better imagery than the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL -- at least on specs alone. If you're a true Android fan and don't want to switch to iOS, hold on to your phone for a few more months as Google could launch a Pixel 4a and 4a XL without the Soli-Radar and the dual-cameras from the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL.", "description": "But now that Pixel 4's won't be coming to India, the only smartphone camera in the country that comes even remotely close to the Pixels in the camera performance are the iPhone 11 and the 11 Pros.
