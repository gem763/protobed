People would wait on wrap-around lines at the Hoboken, N.J. bakery for the shop\u2019s fondant cakes with edible art and Italian-American pastries like lobster tails, rainbow cookies and cannoli which landed him the hit TLC reality show \u201cCake Boss\u201d in 2009.\n\n\u201cHonestly, we were a busy bakery. We did well. I had a Porsche before I was \u2018Cake Boss.\u2019 I had 70 employees, I grew the business,\u201d Valastro told Fox Business. \u201cThe reason why that business did so well was because it was my life. I was there six days a week. I managed \u2060\u2014 micro managed \u2060\u2014 that business like you have no idea. I knew where every single crumb was. How everything went in and out.\u201d\n\n\u201cCake Boss\u201d aired for 10 seasons on TLC, in between, Valastro scaled his bakery to open up shops in New York City\u2019s Times Square, Dallas, Orlando, Philadelphia and Las Vegas. But he had to rethink his retail business model to accommodate customer demand to buy online.\n\n\u201cThe initial idea was to bring back the old-school Italian bakery in every town in America,\u201d Valastro said. \u201cThe problem is, we don\u2019t live like that anymore. During the growth my empire, the whole internet shopping experience hit hard.\u201d\n\nTo adapt, he\u2019s added in third-party delivery services like UberEats and DoorDash so customers can order pastries via the apps, and added on savory items like focaccia to menus.\n\n\u201cSweets are more of an impulse item. We added the savory component into the bakery because you don\u2019t always wake up on a Tuesday morning and say, \u2018You know what? I really need a cannoli,\u2019\u201d Valastro explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot more [business] online. People want to have it [food] delivered to their door step like they do with Amazon, UberEats or DoorDash -- that\u2019s the time we\u2019re in. You have to kind of adapt and survive. You have to be on every platform.\u201d\n\nThe next leg of his cake empire will incorporate pie \u2013 pizza pies. He\u2019s planning to open a fast-casual restaurant concept called Pizzacake in Las Vegas where fans can get pizza, sandwiches or dessert.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be doing pizza in its traditional form, but more of a Roman-style, or focaccia-style pizza where people can grab a slice and go,\" Valastro said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "How the 'Cake Boss' scaled is sweets empire.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Buddy-Valastro-Getty-001.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
