It was fantastic to pop into after work.\n\n'It was family friendly, takings were up, the pub was spotless and there had been no trouble, regulars were well behaved as we all pulled together as a community.\n\nBrewery boss Humphrey Smith (left) famously imposed a ban on bad language and mobile phones at all of the chain's branches in 2017 to encourage 'social conversation'\n\n'He (Mr Smith) is notorious for having a strict ban on using mobile phones, bringing dogs in and swearing.\n\n'He came in, had a drink and seemed happy. But he said he heard a man talking to a woman and the man swore. It wasn't aimed at him, it was nothing at all.\n\n'He's shut the pub for one swear word taking all the money from the till and safe, and left the pub landlady and landlord jobless and homeless. It's not like it was closed after a brawl.'\n\nAnother local said: 'The man was telling his wife a dirty joke and said the F-word. It wasn't aggressive. They were both laughing and joking.\n\n'No one can quite believe the pub's been shut. It's a bit daft really because a pub's where you go to let off steam and enjoy a bit of banter with other people.\n\n'A ban on swearing is a bit much.'", "description": "The Fox and Goose pub in Droitwich, Worcestershire, was opened seven weeks ago by the brewery.
