Members of the movement had links to banned group National Action. The shared belief of these figures and groups was their antipathy towards minorities, immigrants and particularly Muslims.\u201d\n\nA similar pattern has been seen with the use of grooming gangs as a major far-right recruiting tool, which sees extremists characterise the abuse as committed solely by Muslims.\n\nOne of the leading organisers of the Sunderland protests, former English Defence League member Billy Charlton, was jailed for 21 months for inciting racial hatred with his speeches.\n\nThe 55-year-old repeatedly suggested that all immigrants were rapists, shouting: \u201cThese people turn up and are raping our children and we need to hold somebody responsible for it \u2026 get them off our kids, get them off our streets, get them off our island.\u201d\n\nRobinson also gave speeches at the rallies, where crowd members shouted \u201cf*** Islam\u201d, and broadcast the footage via a Canadian website.\n\nThe government report said locals who opposed the demonstrations were abused and intimidated, including a Muslim counter-protester who was labelled a \u201cpaedo\u201d and received death threats after his personal details were published online.\n\nThe original rape allegations were investigated by police but did not result in any charges, and the alleged victim withdrew her support from the campaign in her name in October 2017.\n\nTwo men were later convicted for an unrelated attack in which they raped a woman in their asylum-seeker hostel.\n\nThe commission said small-scale protests have continued in Sunderland, including in relation to Brexit and the imprisonment of Robinson for contempt of court, but external far-right influence had been reduced by Sunderland council and police.\n\nOfficials held public meetings to counter misinformation and address local concerns about the placement of asylum seekers, while drawing up an agreement to reduce the \u201cvolatility\u201d of protests.\n\nThe Commission for Countering Extremism said authorities in Sunderland received no support from central government during the protests, which were amplified by right-wing extremists around the world.\n\nIts report found that, overall, the government\u2019s response to extremism that falls short of terrorism was \u201cslow and unfocused\u201d.\n\nThe agency\u2019s nationwide inquiry, launched after the 2017 terror attacks, found authorities were failing to spot local tensions being exploited, not protecting victims, and were failing to \u201cchallenge the persistent behaviour of hateful extremists who seek to mainstream their dangerous propaganda\u201d.\n\nLead commissioner Sara Khan said \u201chateful extremism\u201d was allowing people to make the \u201cmoral case for violence\u201d while stopping short the threshold for criminal prosecution.\n\n\u201cFrom inspiring terrorist attacks, to hateful extremist groups engaging in persistent hostility, we are grappling with what is a global challenge,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cIf we are to be successful in reducing the extremist threat in our country, we must focus on challenging hateful extremism. My report shows the destructive effect it is having on the lives of individuals, our communities and wider society.\u201d\n\nMs Khan called for an urgent overhaul of the government\u2019s \u201cinsufficient\u201d strategy, based on a new definition of hateful extremism that would give the public and authorities the confidence to challenge it.", "description": "Far-right activists are exploiting concerns about the safety of women and children to target Muslims and ethnic minorities, an official\u00a0report has found.
