The bank told the couple they were responsible for the return of the money.\n\nTiffany Williams, 35, told bank officials \u201cshe would speak to her husband and attempt to construct a repayment agreement\u201d, state trooper Aaron Brown told the Montoursville Sun-Gazette.\n\nIn separate interviews with investigators in late July, both Robert Williams, 36, and his wife \u201cadmitted to knowing the mislaid money did not belong to them, but they spent it anyway\u201d.\n\nThe couple then stopped communicating further with the bank and were later arraigned on felony charges of theft and receiving stolen property.\n\nThe couple\u2019s neighbors offered little sympathy. \u201cI would check in with the bank first before I did anything,\u201d offered Robert Painton, according to local television. \u201cI\u2019m not that dumb but some people do stupid things sometimes.\u201d", "description": "Robert and Tiffany Williams bought a camper, race car and gave money to friends before the bank realized the error", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b2b4a16bc0c8383f0dd8daae84434b922655b08/410_361_3553_2133/master/3553.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=88b3e8b5320b7cafab550a5a73707f92", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
