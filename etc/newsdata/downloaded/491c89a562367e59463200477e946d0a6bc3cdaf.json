That changes Friday with spacewalk No. 421.\n\nNASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir will make \"HERstory,\" as NASA is calling it, with the first all-female spacewalk. All four men aboard the International Space Station will remain inside, as Koch and Meir go out to replace a broken battery charger.\n\nThe battery charger failed after Koch and a male crewmate installed new batteries outside the space station last week. NASA put the remaining battery replacements on hold to fix the problem and moved up the women's planned spacewalk by three days.", "description": "Space Station's 2 Women Prep for 1st All-Female Spacewalk", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/18/2019101800590_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
