In this instance the width of an upright.\n\nWith 65 minutes played here Lazio were in control. A goal to the good through a thunderous first-half strike from Manuel Lazzari, Simone Inzaghi's team were soaking up anything Celtic could throw their way and the frustration was growing. Absorbing the blows and springing quickly from the ropes with a dangerous counter punch, the Serie A side were picking Scotland's champions off at will. Menacing with intent.\n\nSo it was, then, that striker Joaquin Correa gathered in Lazzari's piercing ball and sliced his way through a back-tracking Celtic defence. Cutting inside Kristoffer Ajer the Norwegian was left on the his backside and 60,000 fans waited for the net to bulge.\n\nChristopher Jullien celebrates scoring the winner, completing a comeback for his side\n\nHe rose high to score from a corner in the 89th minute of the match to give Celtic victory\n\nMATCH FACTS CELTIC: Forster, Elhamed (Bitton 83), Ajer, Jullien, Bolingoli (Hayes 85), Brown, McGregor, Christie, Elyounoussi (Rogic 66), Forrest, Edouard Subs not used: Gordon, Bayo, Sinclair, Bauer, Goals: Ryan Christie 67, Jullien 89 Booked: Elyounoussi (62), Jullien (77) Manager: Neil Lennon Lazio: Strakosha; Bastos, Vavro, Acerbi; Lazzari, Parolo, Leiva, Milinkovic, Jony (Lulic 69); Caicedo (Cataldi 85), Correa (Immobile 73) Subs not used: Guerrieri, Luiz Felipe, Patric, Berisha Goals: Lazzari (40) Booked: Bastos (76) Cataldi (87) Manager: Simone Inzaghi REFEREE: Ivan Bebek (Crotia)\n\nAs the ball ricochetted off the base of the upright Celtic supporters peered through the cracks in their fingers and breathed again. Let-off barely covered it.\n\nWithin three minutes Celtic were level with their first real shot on target. Patient build-up play from Odsonne Edouard teed up an enticing opportunity for Ryan Christie to sweep the ball into the net. Somehow, the foundations of Celtic Park survived the eruption.\n\nA corner kick proved the difference in the end. With the clock showing 88 minutes Ryan Christie swung the ball into a crowded area and Christopher Jullien, the \u00a37million summer signing from Toulouse, soared above Lazio's rearguard to glance a Billy McNeill-style header into the corner of the net to scenes reminiscent of the legendary captain's late winner in the Scottish Cup Final of 1965.\n\nThe home team rode their luck at times, no question. Neil Lennon admitted Lazio were the better team at times, yet his team prevailed thanks to the heroics of Fraser Forster.\n\nManuel Lazzari thundered home after he was slipped in on the right by loanee Joaquin Correa\n\nCeltic's top scorer Ryan Christie levelled the scores on 67 minutes with a neat left-footed finish\n\nBringing the Southampton keeper back on loan in the summer was a big call from Celtic's manager. He already had an international shot stopper in Craig Gordon and people wondered if he needed another. Yet the Englishman produced a quite magnificent point blank save from captain Marco Parolo at 1-1.\n\nAs Lazio pounded the home goal in search of an equaliser Celtic tried in vain to break out when they didn't need to. Comparing his side's naivety to Stuart Armstrong in Scotland's 2-2 draw with England they gave the ball away and how Forster stopped a sizzling 20-yard volley from substitute Danilo Cataldi in injury time is anyone's guess. For Lazio it was heart-breaking stuff.\n\nThis was a dogged Celtic, memorable win in the end. Neil Lennon's first over Italian opposition as Parkhead boss kept Scotland's champions top of Group E with seven points from three games. On three points Lazio need to win in Rome in two weeks time. On this evidence they are more than capable.\n\n'It's a great position to be in,' said Lennon. 'It's so important to win your home games. That was a Champions League game for me tonight with the quality on show from both sides, the tempo the game was played at.\n\n'Lazio came to really play. For us to get on the positive side of that result is fantastic.\n\n'Yes, we have seven points but there is still a lot of work to be done in the group to make sure we qualify.\n\nRyan Christie of Celtic celebrates after scoring his team's first goal with Odsonne Edouard\n\nThe gameplan of Simone Inzaghi's gameplan was clear from the start. For over an hour Lazio soaked up everything Celtic could throw at them and attack quickly on the break. The tactics worked to stunning effect five minutes before half-time, stemming directly from Celtic pressure in their own half.\n\nTriggered by Felipe Caicedo the No 20 was taken out on the halfway line, but had already released the ball to Joaquin Correa. The pass which played Manuel Lazzari was sublime, but there was work to do yet. Just as the angle began to look impossible Lazzari lashed a thunderous strike high past Fraser Forster. The only sound emitting from Celtic Park came from joyous Lazio fans.\n\nThe away supporters had already made their presence felt in abhorrent fashion. The spectre of racist behaviour dominated the build up to this match, Lazio's hierarchy lodging an appeal to UEFA over the partial closure of the Stadio Olympico for Celtic's visit next mont after identifying 20 supporters found guilty of making Nazi salutes.\n\nDamning evidence of Italian supporters walking down Buchanan Street in Glasgow City Centre in the hours before the game repeating the gesture suggests UEFA's work is not done yet.\n\nThe first 45 minutes ended without the home team having a shot on target. The opening ha hour came and passed with the home team mustering just one shot of any description.\n\nIt was quite a shot to be fair, Ryan Christie ending a period of determined attack play by clipping the outside of the post with a fizzing 20 yard left foot drive.\n\nA general view during the UEFA Europa League Group E match between Celtic and Lazio\n\nFor Celtic the Lazio goal was a sucker punch. One which seemed to drain their self belief and composure.\n\nTo find a way back into the game they needed to knock Lazio out of their stride. And find support for the isolated figure of Odsonne Edouard.\n\nAfter 58 minutes came hope. Some fine pressing from Christie in the penalty area prompted a rare moment of uncertainty in defence and offered hope. Lazio played themselves into trouble and, though Vavro was there to block Christie's shot, Acerbi still had to make a slightly panicky follow-up clearance.\n\nThe truth is that Celtic should have been down and out when Lazzari - an absolute menace - played in Correa for the effort which hit the post. Had that gone in the game was done. Unlucky to hit the woodwork in the first half Christie clinically swept his 12th goal of the season into the net and the game was back in the melting pot.\n\nEven so, Lazio could have won it. Forster's close range save from Parolo was outstanding. Coming off the bench the dangerman Immobile was through through after a one two and contrived to drag his shot across the face of goal. How they paid for that rare moment of imprecision when Jullien headed a dramatic winner.\n\nGiven the Nazi worshipping of their fans it was hard to find a great deal of sympathy for Lazio in the end. The team, perhaps. The supporters? They got what they deserved.", "description": "STEPHEN MCGOWAN AT PARKHEAD: There are nights when games turn on the thinnest of margins.
