The covers album you\u2019ll have come across, somewhere along the way from Bryan Ferry\u2019s These Foolish Things to Cher\u2019s Dancing Queen. But have you ever been to a covers gig?\n\nThis is when one well-known musical act devotes a whole evening to the songs of another. It\u2019s a growing phenomenon, with recent examples ranging from Tom Chaplin of Keane belting out Queen\u2019s greatest hits to Camille O\u2019Sullivan putting a cabaret spin on the collected works of Nick Cave.\n\nBoth were excellent. The covers gig is a form of entertainment that\u2019s hard to get wrong.\n\nThe evening begins with two showstoppers, Superstition and Living For The City. Beverley Knight (above) is such a live wire that you doubt whether she can keep it up but she does\n\nThe Queen show was put on for BBC Radio 2 by Leo Green, whose eponymous 24-piece orchestra acted as the backing band. Now they are performing the songs of Stevie Wonder with lead vocals from Beverley Knight.\n\nGreen, son of the late saxophonist Benny, doesn\u2019t do things by halves: there are so many people on stage that, if the show was called off, they could stage a football match instead.\n\nPutting a singer together with a songbook is a form of matchmaking, and Green does it so well he may have to set up a website. Knight is a proper soul singer, brought up in church like so many of the greats, and a lifelong Stevie Wonder fan who remembers hearing Sir Duke on the radio when she was four.\n\nBut she\u2019s also very much her own person. Rather than being a man of nearly 70 from Detroit, she\u2019s a woman in her 40s from Wolverhampton. Wearing a sparkly white jumpsuit.\n\nIT'S A FACT Stevie Wonder's daughter Aisha, the first of his nine children and for whom he wrote Isn't She Lovely, is now 44 and sings with him on tour.\n\nThe evening begins with two showstoppers, Superstition and Living For The City. Dancing, laughing, hitting long high notes, Knight is such a live wire that you doubt whether she can keep it up \u2013 and then she does, for two hours.\n\nShe nails one uptempo classic after another: a blazing I Wish, a stirring For Once In My Life, a storming Sir Duke, an uplifting Uptight. But as Knight points out, Stevie\u2019s good at heartbreak too, so she turns on a sixpence to give us a stately Lately.\n\nThe arrangements are faithful, if occasionally over-egged. The singing is freer, full of love for the songs but light years from a tribute act. Knight makes the material her own by replacing the conversational ease of the originals with sheer exuberance.\n\nAs she leaves the stage, she\u2019s still dancing \u2013 lost in Wonder.\n\nThis show is at Bournemouth International Centre tonight and Birmingham Symphony Hall tomorrow.\n\nbeverleyknight.com", "description": "The cover version you know all about.
