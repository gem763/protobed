Awarding two laureates at once is uncommon and comes after a scandal upended the Swedish Academy last year. 57-year-old Tokarczuk, 2018\u2019s winner, was chosen for her \u201cnarrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life,\u201d per the judges\u2019 citation obtained by NPR. Handke, 76, was honored for his \u201cinfluential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience.\u201d\n\nTokarczuk\u2019s Nobel Prize is long overdue. In 2018, Jean-Claude Arnault, husband of then\u2013Swedish Academy member Katarina Frostenson, was accused of (and eventually convicted of) rape, prompting the resignation of several board members, including the former head. Arnault was also accused of leaking Nobel Prize winners to place large bets. After losing so many members, the Academy found itself incapable of choosing a 2018 winner. It was the first year since World War II without a laureate. This year appears to be running much more smoothly. The ceremony will take place in December and the Nobel Peace Prize is set to be announced Friday, October 11.", "description": "The Swedish academy gave out two Nobel Prizes in Literature this year, after a scandal postponed the award in 2018.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/10/10-alfred-nobel-prize.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
