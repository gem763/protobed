Most giant tech firms tout a mixture of free speech, privacy and ease of use as pillars of their services and devices, values that don\u2019t always align with helping the police crack a case.\n\nAmazon initially fought law enforcement on subpoenaing recordings from one of its Echo speakers that may have been witness to a murder but eventually turned them over. The FBI cracked a San Bernardino terrorist\u2019s phone with help from professional hackers after Apple declined to help. And the United States, Britain and Australia have all called on Facebook to halt its plans to encrypt its messaging apps, unless it provides a way for investigators to see communications.\n\nAD\n\n(Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nAD\n\nGoogle said in an emailed response to questions about Google Maps that safety is \u201ca top priority\u201d and that reporting features can be beneficial to public safety. \u201cWe believe that informing drivers about upcoming speed traps allows them to be more careful and make safer decisions when they\u2019re on the road,\u201d said Google spokeswoman Genevieve Park.\n\nNYPD spokeswoman Sgt. Mary Frances O\u2019Donnell said in a statement Monday that \u201cthe Department has engaged in productive discussions with Google to make information available to drivers that will make roads safer and encourage responsible driving, while not impeding the enforcement of New York State Vehicle and Traffic laws.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere have previously been lower-tech options for reporting DUI or DWI checkpoints and speed traps. German radio stations alert drivers to the locations of speed traps on the Autobahn. Drivers sometimes flash their headlights to oncoming traffic to warn others of police in the area. On social media, users sometimes note recent checkpoint locations on Nextdoor, Twitter and other platforms.\n\nAD\n\nAn Ohio man was arrested in 2014 for holding up a sign that said, \u201cCheck point ahead! Turn now!,\u201d according to a CBS News report. He was eventually cleared of the charges against him.\n\nThere are also several apps aimed specifically at documenting police presence, including sobriety checkpoints.\n\nAD\n\nGoogle Maps is also adding other categories of incidents that can be reported by iPhone and Android users: objects in the road, lane closures, construction and disabled vehicles. While the app has an option to report \u201cspeed traps,\u201d it does not have one for sobriety checkpoints or a means to comment within the reporting feature. Waze allows users to report \u201cpolice\u201d and \u201ccamera,\u201d and to create comments that explain whether the incident is a checkpoint or another type of law enforcement activity.\n\nBut map apps have transformed communities in more than one way, as they frequently route cars around traffic and onto unexpected roads \u2014 sometimes making traffic worse in other areas.\n\nAD\n\nIn one example, a quiet Maryland street suddenly became inundated with several hundred cars an hour after Waze routed vehicles there. The situation led an exasperated homeowner to submit false reports of a blockage on the street in an attempt to trick the algorithm. He was unsuccessful.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to mobile data and analytics firm App Annie, Google Maps had more than 177 million monthly active smartphone users, and Apple Maps had nearly 74 million monthly active smartphone users in the United States last month.\n\nBut Apple Maps could have a chance to catch up as it moves to make improvements. Apple plans this year and next to roll out updates including more detailed graphics and better pedestrian information. Apple said in a statement that the updates came after the company drove \u201c4 million miles to rebuild the basemap from the ground up.\u201d\n\nApple Maps suffered an embarrassing debut in 2012 that involved bloopers including missing transit information and a misplaced Washington Monument.\n\nAD", "description": "The company enabled the reporting mechanism for Android users earlier this year.", "authors": ["Marie C.
