But he has something to prove. We know he does.\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot of businessmen here and I think most of them will tell me to fight him because it\u2019ll bring money. I'd fight all the main contenders first, and I could fight him to benefit my agricultural projects.\n\n\"I have to say that Tony Ferguson deserves it more. You have to give him credit. He is on a 12-fight win streak and he deserves it more than Conor.\n\n\"Conor should come back, win, earn his place and get in line.\"", "description": "McGregor posted a picture of himself alongside one of Rogan - and a joke about the IRA", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Conor Mcgregor Instagram", "Zuffa Llc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543475.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Conor-McGregor.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
