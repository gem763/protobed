Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, released a statement Thursday afternoon saying that Biden will reform campaign finance if he is president, but in the meantime, he will open the door to outside money. [...] Biden allies began meeting weeks ago to discuss launching a super PAC. Those discussions emerged amid dissatisfaction about some components of Biden\u2019s campaign, as well as worry that he was being naive about what would be required to counter Trump\u2019s attacks while simultaneously making his own case.\n\nBiden and his allies think this is something he can\u2019t do without. But is that really true?\n\nAD\n\nA look at the recent past might make you think so. In 2016, outside groups spent more than $100 million on Donald Trump\u2019s behalf and more than $200 million on Hillary Clinton\u2019s, making up a significant portion of overall campaign spending. Without that money, you might think, a candidate couldn\u2019t compete.\n\nExpect there are many reasons to believe otherwise. Let\u2019s start with the primary, where the whole reason Biden is contemplating reversing his position on super PACs is that his fundraising trails that of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom not only don\u2019t want outside help but refuse to even do fundraising events for high-dollar donors. (If you want to write a check for the legal limit of $2,800 they\u2019ll take it; they just aren\u2019t going to ply you with canap\u00e9s to get you to do it.)\n\nAD\n\nAs of the last reporting period at the end of September, Sanders had $33 million in the bank, Warren had $25 million, and Biden had $9 million. Despite being the \u201cestablishment\u201d candidate in the race, the former vice president was trailing the candidates who are depending on repeated small contributions from a larger group of donors.\n\nAD\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that Biden could just turn off one spigot and expect the money to flow in equal measure from another. Sanders and Warren are succeeding in raising all that grass-roots cash because they have a wide base of enthusiastic supporters. Right now it appears that Biden\u2019s support is as broad as theirs, but not nearly as deep; he has millions of Democrats who will tell a pollster he\u2019s their choice, but they aren\u2019t so jazzed about him that they\u2019re opening up their wallets. That has made him much more reliant on large donations from fewer people.\n\nHe also may have concluded that accepting help from a super PAC might generate a day or two of bad headlines and charges of hypocrisy, but it\u2019s worth it to get the help. But there isn\u2019t much evidence to suggest that\u2019s the case. More money is always better than less money, of course, but in the primaries it\u2019s hard to imagine that whatever problems Biden has can be solved with a bunch of ads being dropped on TV in Des Moines or on Facebook (since super PACs can\u2019t coordinate directly with candidates, they usually dump most of their money on ineffectual advertising).\n\nAD\n\nIf instead he\u2019s looking forward to the general election, that could be a different story, provided that the pro-Biden super PAC spent its money wisely, which is never a guarantee. But there, too, the same question comes up: Is money going to be a problem for the Democratic nominee?\n\nAD\n\nGiven the enormous sums Democrats are already contributing to primary candidates, it\u2019s likely that the party\u2019s nominee will have all the money they need, as Democrats desperate to be rid of Trump contribute whatever they can. And after a certain point, a few extra million \u2014 or even a few extra hundred million \u2014 may not make much difference. Don\u2019t forget that Clinton outspent Trump in 2016 by more than $300 million, but he still won.\n\nAnd consider this: Trump and the super PACs supporting him have already spent an incredible $171 million on the 2020 campaign. He has spent more than $25 million on Facebook and Google ads alone. And for what? He trails all the leading Democrats in many polls, his approval rating is stuck around 40 percent, and he\u2019s about to be impeached.\n\nAD\n\nAs far as campaign sins go, accepting the help of a super PAC is pretty minor, and I don\u2019t doubt that Biden would sincerely prefer a system in which they didn\u2019t exist. But if he\u2019s going to become the Democratic nominee and then the president, it\u2019ll be because he was the best candidate. Not because he was saved by a super PAC.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "He can take the outside money, but he'll rise or fall on his own merits.", "authors": ["Paul Waldman", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4xLq3cIofNrR974EqEo3EiocYOs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IY5JRHYTJBEWNJEXZ4BUHMRH2U", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
