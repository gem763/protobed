Ebdi told the US broadcaster the Turkish offensive could lead to ethnic cleansing. He said the decision to pull out \u201churt the credibility\u201d of the US, adding, \u201cWhen you broke or hurt the credibility or the confidence, it\u2019s not an easy thing to recover it.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his army was ready to strike against Kurdish militants \u201cat any moment\u201d, i24 News reported.\n\n\u201cThere is a phrase that we always say \u2014 we can come any night without warning,\u201d Mr Erdogan told reporters. \u201cIt is absolutely out of the question for us to further tolerate the threats from these terrorist groups.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s Defence Ministry tweeted just after midnight that its troops were ready to fight to protect its 82 million citizens. \u201cIf we die we are martyrs, if we don\u2019t, we are war veterans,\u201d the account wrote.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, the Defence Ministry said the establishment of a safe zone was essential and that it would never tolerate a \u201cterror corridor\u201d on its border. \u201cAll preparations for the operation have been completed,\u201d it added.\n\n#BREAKING: Reports: Turkish warplanes have bombed the Semelka Border Crossing at the Syria-Iraq border\n\npic.twitter.com/4Pi1mAratB \u2014 Amichai Stein (@AmichaiStein1) October 7, 2019\n\nNEW \u2014 Turkish military, with this pic below, wows that it is ready to combat all terror groups that threaten all Turkish citizens, \u201cif we die we are martyrs, if we don\u2019t, we are war veterans\u201d\n\n\n\nThe post was sent in midnight in Turkey local time.\n\n\n\nClear messaging on Syria op pic.twitter.com/1QJzg8movN \u2014 Rag\u0131p Soylu (@ragipsoylu) October 7, 2019\n\nIt came hours after Donald Trump threatened to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it doesn\u2019t watch over captured Islamic State fighters detained in Syria following his decision to pull US forces out of the region.\n\nIn a tweet on Monday, the US President wrote: \u201cIf Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey\u201d.\n\nMr Trump defended his sudden decision to pull back US troops from northeastern Syria, clearing the way for an expected Turkish military invasion against Kurdish forces who fought alongside American forces to defeat the Islamic State. Turkey views the Kurds as a threat to the country.\n\nmedia_camera An airstrike by a U.S. led coalition warplane explodes on an ISIL position in Rojava in 2015. Picture: John Moore/Getty Images\n\nMr Trump\u2019s surprise move \u2014 described by the SDF as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d \u2014 goes against the advice of senior officials in the Pentagon and state department.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans warn that a Turkish attack could lead to a massacre of the Kurds, who are holding thousands of captured IS fighters and their families.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, a senior state department official said the number of personnel being pulled back from the border area was \u201cvery small\u201d, about two dozen in total, and that they had been moved a \u201cvery short distance\u201d.\n\nGen. Ebdi said the total number of American troops being moved was closer to 150, while a National Security Council official who spoke to Newsweek put the number at 230 service members, among them US Special Forces and reconnaissance units.\n\nThe troops were reportedly withdrawn from two observation posts in the towns of Tel Abyad and Ain Issa in northern Syria, along a 100km section of the border which appears to be the immediate focus of Turkey\u2019s military plans.\n\nThe Defence Department made it clear in a statement Tuesday that the Pentagon does not endorse the Turkish operation in Northern Syria and the US will not be involved in the operation.\n\nmedia_camera President Donald Trump talks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, October 4, 2019, in Washington. Picture: AP/Evan Vucci.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell, one of Mr Trump\u2019s staunchest allies, urged the President to reverse the move.\n\n\u201cA precipitous withdrawal of US forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI urge the President to exercise American leadership to keep together our multinational coalition to defeat ISIS and prevent significant conflict between our NATO ally Turkey and our local Syrian counterterrorism partners.\n\n\u201cMajor new conflict between Turkey and our partners in Syria would seriously risk damaging Turkey\u2019s ties to the United States and causing greater isolation for Turkey on the world stage.\u201d\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, a top Republican ally of Mr Trump, is threatening legislation to impose economic sanctions on Turkey if it invades Syria. Mr Graham has Democratic allies and warned that any congressional vote would be overwhelming.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s announcement immediately drew pushback from Republican politicians. Mr Graham said Monday that Mr Trump\u2019s moves are a \u201cdisaster in the making\u201d that would empower IS and Syria.\n\n\u201cI hope President Trump will reassess and take sound military advice,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe have sent the most dangerous signal possible \u2014 America is an unreliable ally.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s already spoken to Maryland Democrat Chris Van Hollen about drafting the sanctions legislation. Mr Graham said on Twitter that \u201csanctions against Turkey \u2014 if necessary \u2014 would be veto-proof.\u201d\n\nUtah Republican Senator Mitt Romney also weighed in, saying Trump\u2019s \u201cdecision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal.\u201d\n\nAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!). They must, with Europe and others, watch over... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\n....the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nBasically the US persuaded the SDF Kurds to dismantle defensive positions that deterred Turkey, promising security guarantees in exchange. Then once the SDF Kurds became defenseless, Trump gave Erdogan the green light to invade. Hard to imagine a more sinister sequence of events. https://t.co/Of9wloQKv1 \u2014 Yaroslav Trofimov (@yarotrof) October 7, 2019\n\nA moment of American betrayal - and these moments matter. The US partnered with Syrian Kurds. Together they fought and defeated the isis state. Now Trump is abandoning the Kurds to allow a Turkish invasion. (And don\u2019t forget the Kurds are guarding thousands of isis members...) \u2014 Richard Engel (@RichardEngel) October 7, 2019\n\nSyria\u2019s Kurds accuse the US of turning its back on its allies and risking gains made in the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nMr Trump defended the move in a series of tweets, acknowledging that \u201cThe Kurds fought with us\u201d but claiming they \u201cwere paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so.\u201d\n\nLast year, the US raised tariffs on some Turkish products and imposed sanctions on top officials as relations between the two NATO countries worsened over a number of issues.\n\nMr Erdogan has said his aim was to combat Kurdish fighters in the border area and set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d for up to two million of the more than 3.6 million Syrian refugees currently living in Turkey.\n\nIn a statement, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said \u201cthe Department of Defence made clear to Turkey \u2014 as did the president \u2014 that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in Northern Syria\u201d.\n\nEarlier, Mr Trump said it was time \u201cto get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal\u201d and that \u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their \u2018neighbourhood\u2019\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey all hate ISIS, have been enemies for years,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nmegan.palin@news.com.au | @Megan_Palin\n\n\u2014 with wires\n\nOriginally published as Turkey bombs Kurds after US \u2018betrayal\u2019", "description": "Turkish warplanes have begun bombing Kurdish positions in Syria, after Donald Trump pulled US support for its allies in a stab in the back.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e9e0f03a336b663501cc5cdb1e99c07b", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
