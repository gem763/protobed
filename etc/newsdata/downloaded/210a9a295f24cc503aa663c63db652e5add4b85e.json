And so when the Manchester City manager decided to use his press conference at Deepdale on Tuesday night to speak out in defence of Bernardo Silva, he will have been fully aware of the impact of his words on an issue that, with a depressing predictability, is already being co-opted into a tiresome tribal combat. At its heart is a complex debate about offence and intent, about ignorance and historical prejudice, about identity and opportunism, about character and decency. To a large extent, though, it\u2019s also about chocolate-covered peanuts.\n\nOn Sunday, Bernardo tweeted two pictures side by side: one of his friend and team-mate Benjamin Mendy as a child, one of the logo for Conguitos, a popular snack freely available in Spain. \u201cGuess who?\u201d ran the caption, alongside a couple of laughing emojis to establish that this was, indeed, a joke. No doubt chuckling heartily to himself, Bernardo tapped on the \u2018send tweet\u2019 button and returned to his daily business.\n\nAt which point, two separate impulses kicked in, one after the other. The first, which I like to imagine as the prevailing reaction, was a sort of mid-level nausea: an involuntary recoil that perhaps stopped just short of outright revulsion, but still left a bitter aftertaste. The Conguitos logo features a number of established tropes frequently found in racist caricature: round bulging eyes, fat red lips, no clothes. The name literally means \u201clittle people from the Congo\u201d, and Conguitos adverts from decades ago employ the crudest sort of racial stereotyping.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut you didn\u2019t need to know any of that in advance. On a simple sight test, equating an amorphous chocolate-covered blob with an actual live human failed by every measure. It looked bad. The fact that Mendy himself \u2013 publicly, at least \u2013 pronounced himself highly amused made no odds. If you\u2019re tweeting racist imagery in a public forum to 600,000 followers, the reaction of one ceases to be the only concern. Before long the FA had contacted City to demand an explanation, with a potential six-game ban in the offing should Bernardo be found guilty of discrimination.\n\nBy which point the second impulse had kicked in, one grounded not in genuine distaste but in the gleeful, vengeful, self-interested outrage of the footballing partisan. The sort largely uninterested in ingrained racist stereotypes and their complex, insidious legacy on wider society; at least, until they present an irresistible opportunity to banter off a hated rival. And so began the game of pile-on from Liverpool and Manchester United fans, the counter pile-on from City fans: the bad-faith bickering of nonentities on the internet, ripping each other to metaphorical shreds in defence of their own phallic tribalism.\n\nIt was into this seething cesspit of bile and distrust that Guardiola unwittingly trod on Tuesday night. Asked about the FA investigation, he could easily have withheld comment. Or he could have stood squarely behind the player, offering Bernardo his support whilst also acknowledging the offence caused. Instead, he doubled down. \u201cThe image is not about the colour of the skin,\u201d he argued. \u201cHe took a picture of Benjamin when he was young and he related it to this cartoon, which was quite similar. There are many situations with white people, and you look at a cartoon and the face is quite similar to your face.\u201d\n\n\u201cBernardo is one of the most lovely people I ever met in my life. An exceptional person. A guy who can speak five languages. It\u2019s because he\u2019s open-minded \u2013 nothing about the colour of the skin, nationalities or whatever. One of his best friends is Mendy. He\u2019s like a brother for him. They are joking all the time.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s try and follow through the thread of logic, such as it is. What Guardiola appears to be arguing here is that Bernardo speaks five languages, is a lovely bloke, and one of his best friends is black, and so what he tweeted can\u2019t possibly be racist. And besides, it\u2019s just the same for white people! If Bernardo\u2019s tweet could be explained away as pure, forgivable ignorance \u2013 which is why a quiet word and a couple of hours of diversity training would be infinitely preferable to a multi-game ban \u2013 then Guardiola\u2019s intervention was, in its own way, far more worrying.\n\nBecause implicit in Guardiola\u2019s defence of Bernardo was the sort of ex-hominem reasoning so prevalent in apologias of racist behaviour: the intentional and disingenuous conflation of a racist act with \u201cbeing a racist\u201d. The former is quite clearly defined by the 1999 Macpherson report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, which clearly asserts that racism can be perpetrated unwittingly, indeed entirely innocently, and often under the guise of well-meaning humour. A \u201cracist incident\u201d, Lord Macpherson writes, is \u201cany incident which is perceived to be racist by the victim or any other person\u201d.\n\nIt is the last four words of that sentence that are operative here. It doesn\u2019t really matter if you don\u2019t find Bernardo\u2019s tweet offensive. The fact is that plenty did, and even if we grant a certain degree of anti-City opportunism in the backlash, this isn\u2019t so much a question of virtues and morals as one of basic courtesy. Even if you\u2019re not personally affronted, why invalidate the experience of those who were? Why not be delicate? Why not tread with just a little caution?\n\nBut then, we live in febrile and callous times, where the hurt of others is at best acceptable collateral damage, and at worst a cynical ploy. And so we end up in a thicket of wilful obfuscations, constructive ambiguities and false equivalences. We end up disappearing down the rabbit hole of whether Bernardo is \u201ca racist\u201d, a term that has no fixed definition, and thus can be endlessly argued and endlessly denied. We are told that wasting time on frivolities like this hurts the fight against \u201creal racism\u201d, which for some reason can only be defined by white people.\n\nAnd of course, this being City and this being Guardiola, everything gets rolled into a wider snowball of grievance, the ardent belief of many City fans that they are uniquely reviled within the English game, and by the media in general. The truth is that clubs have been downplaying racism for their own benefit for years, whether it was Liverpool disgracefully standing behind Luis Suarez over the Patrice Evra affair, or Alex Ferguson in the 1990s defending Peter Schmeichel\u2019s alleged racist remarks to Ian Wright on the bizarre grounds that Manchester United had run coaching courses in the South African townships. Everyone likes to talk a good game on racism. But when it comes down to it, most people would rather win.\n\nSo perhaps Guardiola was simply sticking up for his guy. If so, it was poorly expressed, tactless and insensitive, a galaxy-brain defence of racist imagery on the grounds that the perpetrator happens to speak French. In that respect, it was of a piece with his assertion last year that \u201cmy kids go to school with different... Indian people, black people, normal people, from everywhere\u201d. One expects this was simply a case of crossed wires in his third language. Either way, an explanation would be handy.\n\nAnd whether intentional or not, his latest comments misrepresent the historical and fundamentally asymmetric nature of racism, propagating a number of long-standing myths. That racism can only ever be intentional. That being a really lovely guy is a valid defence against problematic behaviour. That if something isn\u2019t a problem for white people, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem for black people, either.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t think Bernardo is a racist, whatever that means. I don\u2019t think Guardiola is, either. But equally, I don\u2019t think these sorts of judgements get us very far at all. As a society, we need to find a way of talking about race that avoids easy demonisation. As a sport, we need to address these issues in a way that transcends tribalism. And so as far as Guardiola is concerned, no stigmas. No labels. No shaming. No witch hunt, no cheap shots, no exemplary punishment.
