Photo: Courtesy of the retailer\n\nIf you\u2019re a new Strategist reader, this article is a good place to start. In March 2018, Strategist editors noticed that a weirdly stylish coat from Amazon seemed to be the coat to have among the ladies-who-lunch crowd on New York\u2019s Upper East Side (who typically favored Celine and Canada Goose). Katy Schneider began to work her sources to track down exactly where this slouchy coat came from and why it was so popular. The story led to over 10,000 sales of the coat on Amazon and an eternal best-seller tag.\n\nGretchen Fenton, a style consultant who lives on the Upper East Side, first noticed the coat on her friend Fernanda Niven, a creative director who also lives on the Upper East Side. Fernanda heard about it from Cayli Cavaco, the founder of Knockout Beauty, and told some 20 people about it.\n\nBut in case it seemed like Cayli Cavaco was the first to wear the coat: Lauren Epstein, a Chinatown-based stylist, heard about it from her friend who lives on the Upper East Side \u2014 who says she first saw it on her daughter\u2019s preschool teacher at the 92nd Street Y. The teacher at the 92nd Street Y, Jessica Reich, found it on a travel blog she liked, The Blonde Abroad, while planning for a trip to Iceland in 2016. So maybe Reich got the ball rolling. But who can say, really.\n\nThe coat is fairly plain: paneled, olive green, and made by a company called Orolay, a Chinese brand that also, curiously, makes folding chairs, storage cabinets, and wall-mounted tables. It\u2019s sold on Amazon for \u00a3140. And it\u2019s the most popular coat of the winter, at least among a certain set of stylish uptown women. \u2018I first saw it on one of my mom friends,\u2019 said Ana Maria Pimentel, the fashion director at Neiman Marcus. \u2018She said, Oh, it\u2019s an Amazon coat. I bought it. Two weeks later, I went to a SoulCycle and I was one of four people wearing it. And I think one of them was [socialite and creative consultant] Lauren DuPont.\u2019 Pimentel says she\u2019s heard rumblings that the first to wear it was a Korean blogger who wore it out uptown \u2014 and has contributed to the trickle-down effect herself. \u2018Seven of my super-close friends have bought it since,\u2019 she says. \u2018A woman at a department store literally bought it on her phone, right in front of me.\u2019\n\nFernanda Niven\u2019s sister Eugenie; Lauren Epstein (far right); and Jessica Reich, accidental trend-starter.\n\nThe coat\u2019s appeal lies in its fashionable-yet-accessible, lightly directional look (the voluminous paneling and zippers have \u2018a little Balenciaga influence,\u2019 says Pimentel) and its startling price \u2014 the super-stylish women who own it take pleasure in telling curious onlookers that no, their jacket is not Sacai, and, actually, it costs under \u00a3150 including shipping if you\u2019re an Amazon Prime member. \u2018I think the intrigue is both that it\u2019s super-attainable, and super-different \u2014 something that spread solely by word of mouth, something that no one knows about,\u2019 says Pimentel.\n\nExcept now, of course, people do know about it. The coat has spread downtown, to Brooklyn \u2014 Fenton\u2019s sister, a Brooklynite who owns the coat herself, reported seeing one on a woman in line at C.O. Bigelow in the Village \u2014 and, of course, has become near ubiquitous east of Central Park. \u2018It\u2019s like the Moncler when it first came out,\u2019 says Epstein. \u2018Or the black puffy North Face in the \u201990s, when it first came out.\u2019 Which isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing, at least for the women who found it first. \u2018Since I started wearing it in January,\u2019 says Epstein, \u2018at least eight of my friends have bought it. And of course, now I no longer want to wear mine anymore.\u2019 But some remain undeterred. \u2018People cross the street to ask me where I got it,\u2019 says Niven. \u2018I\u2019m just really hoping they make it in navy for next winter.\u2019\n\nOther Strat-Approved Orolay Coats\n\nOrolay Women\u2019s Thickened Contrast Color Drawstring Down Jacket Hooded Coat We approve of these cool orange toggles. \u00a3120 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nOrolay Women\u2019s Down Jacket With Faux Fur Trim Hood Very similar to the original, except with a fuzzier hood. \u00a3100 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
