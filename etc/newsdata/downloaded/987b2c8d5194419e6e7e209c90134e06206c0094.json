As the entrenched favorite streaming service with the biggest audience, Netflix sets the standard for Disney+ to meet or beat. And Disney\u2019s evidently not going to do its rival any favors. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Disney is banning Netflix from advertising on any of its TV networks. Insiders claim that this originally stretched to all rival streaming networks, but Disney later reversed that decision for every company except Netflix.\n\nThis is not a small thing for Netflix, which has invested hundreds of millions in advertising every year. It warns investors about the possibility of its usual advertising avenues being cut off in its 2018 annual report:\n\nCompanies that promote our service may decide that we negatively impact their business or may make business decisions that in turn negatively impact us. For example, if they decide that they want to compete more directly with us, enter a similar business or exclusively support our competitors, we may no longer have access to their marketing channels\u2026. [If] the cost of our existing sources increases, our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected.\n\nA spokesperson for the Disney Company told WSJ it\u2019d reversed a ban on these ads \u201cto reflect the comprehensive business relationships we have with many of these companies.\u201d Ultimately, it likely leads back to Disney\u2019s decision to enter the streaming competition.\n\nSimilarly, Disney\u2019s got beef with Amazon over the right to distribute the former\u2019s apps on the latter\u2019s Fire TV devices. According to a different report from the WSJ, Amazon is demanding a significant chunk of ad space on Disney\u2019s apps, which will include Disney+, and Disney\u2019s not willing to offer it. I\u2019m sure the fact that Disney+ will have to compete with Amazon\u2019s Prime Video in the streaming sphere plays into it somehow.\n\nBoth companies have leverage: Disney\u2019s apps are very popular and have a metric ton of content, and lack of support for them could hurt Fire TV sales. Amazon\u2019s Fire TV has millions of active subscribers who might not even look twice at Disney+ if it\u2019s not available on their device.\n\nThe streaming industry used to be a one-horse race, with that horse being Netflix. Now, with so many jockeying for our attention and money, they might start backstabbing each other to get ahead. I suspect NBC and WarnerMedia might not get as much advertising space on Disney\u2019s channels once they launch Peacock and HBOMax, respectively.\n\nSo where does this leave us, the consumers? It definitely effects what kinds of ads we\u2019re going to see \u2014 which in turn, effects how many of us will use each service. Competition for our eyes and minds is so fierce, I fully expect formerly cordial relationships between big tech companies to sour over it.\n\nRead next: Sennheiser is definitely mocking Beats in its new ad campaign", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F11%2FDisney-Plus.jpg&signature=e7082e565f491e9ace84875689b96fc5", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
