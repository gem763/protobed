I accept the opinions. When you don't win, not only at Tottenham, this happens at every club in the world.\n\n'It is normal that the game has created a lot of opinion and rumours, everyone needs to talk.\n\n'But in the end, the only thing that happened is that we lost a game. I have no doubt we are going to stay together and find a way to be successful again, no doubt.\n\n'In five-and-a-half years, every single press conference we have talked about my future.\n\n'I hope [because] we are still talking, it means that I am going to spend five more years here, at least.'\n\nSpurs' poor start to the season got worse when they were embarrassed 7-2 by Bayern Munich\n\nTottenham players fear their manager is looking for a way out of north London.\n\nSources have told Sportsmail that the Argentine has become noticeably distant at the training centre since returning this summer.\n\nAfter Tuesday's humiliating loss \u2014 the first time Spurs have ever conceded seven at home \u2014 Pochettino stressed the importance of sticking together. However, his mood has led players to feel their manager is having doubts over his future.\n\nPochettino has a good relationship with most of his squad but sources indicated that the manager is less visible at training, even watching some sessions from indoors.\n\nThe 47-year-old led Spurs to the Champions League final last season. But some of the squad have noticed a change in their manager since returning from their summer break.\n\nThere is no danger of Pochettino losing his job despite the disappointing start to the season. Tottenham having to pay \u00a332million to sack him is a key reason his job is safe \u2014 although they could recoup that if he was poached by another club.\n\nPochettino believes his playing squad are fully committed to the club despite speculation\n\nSpurs' woes on the pitch have also come against a backdrop of uncertainty in the dressing room with several key players contemplating moves away.\n\nChristian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen are all in the final 12 months of their contracts while reports suggest Harry Kane may be on his way out too.\n\nDespite those fears, Pochettino believes his players remain fully committed.\n\n'Yes I really believe [that],' said the Argentine, when asked he still had the full backing of his squad.\n\n'I have no doubt that the players want to always do their best to try to win. First of all, they play for themselves, for their families and then for the club and the coaching staff.\n\n'I don't have doubts about their commitment.'", "description": "The Argentine's future at the club is in doubt after a poor start to the season plunged to new depths on Tuesday night when Spurs were embarrassed 7-2 by Bayern Munich in the Champions League.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/13/19295910-0-image-a-98_1570191397048.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
