It\u2019s a team thing. Don\u2019t isolate one person, we\u2019re a whole team. If it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.\n\n\u201cWe did speak about that. Harry Kane did ask the question about instead of going through the three steps, if we decide that we want to stop the game and we want to stop the game \u2013 no matter what the score is \u2013 if we\u2019re not happy with it, as a team we\u2019ll decide whether or not to stay on the pitch.\n\n\u201cI do [think it could happen]. Watching the gaffer speaking yesterday, he was quite keen on putting a stop to it. No one wants it in football. It\u2019s not just affecting one person, it\u2019s affecting the team. It\u2019s a team decision if we decide in the end that we don\u2019t want to play this game anymore because of what\u2019s going on, we\u2019ll come off as a team.\u201d", "description": "Uefa would be forced to convene an\u00a0emergency panel should the England team decide to ignore the governing body\u2019s three-step protocol and walk off the pitch in the face of racism during their upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers\u00a0in Czech Republic and Bulgaria.", "authors": ["Lawrence Ostlere"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/25/22/Danny-Rose.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
