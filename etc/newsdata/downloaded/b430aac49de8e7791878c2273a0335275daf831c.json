Wales beat them again to clinch the title, and doubts swirled about Ireland\u2019s ability to win the Rugby World Cup.\n\nLess than a month out, those concerns were amplified when the Irish went to Twickenham and were blown away by England 57-15. It was only a warmup game but they were embarrassing. Coach Joe Schmidt explained away the dismal display on his players being \u201cheavy-legged\u201d from a training camp in Portugal.\n\nFinally, the Ireland of 2018 showed up in the eighth test of the year in the last warmup against Wales this month. The 19-10 win wasn\u2019t pretty but it was certainly intense, as the Irish physically bullied Wales, and kept the visitors scoreless in the second half.\n\nSchmidt demanded a performance to restore confidence, to ensure they went to Japan in a good mood and with some momentum. The pack gradually dominated the Welsh, recently sidelined halves pairing Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton cleared out the cobwebs, and centers Bundee Aki and Robbie Henshaw enjoyed decisive moments.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a performance we can be proud of,\u201d Schmidt said, with no little relief.\n\nWales coach Warren Gatland, after hoping to derail Ireland\u2019s World Cup hopes, brushed aside the result publicly. In the same revisionary way, Schmidt downplayed Ireland\u2019s modest form this year, suggesting results were sacrificed to ensure his side was primed for winning its first World Cup title.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d won three of the last five Six Nations, we didn\u2019t need another one of those,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cWe need a semifinal in this big competition coming up. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve done too much farming, but if you try to chase the whole herd, all you end up doing is chasing. But if you corral things and decide where your priorities are, I think you give yourself a better chance.\u201d\n\nThe vagaries of the World Rugby rankings, based on appoints exchanged system between the competing teams in each test, meant the victory lifted Ireland to No. 1 for the first time. It feels out of whack. Last year, Ireland was clearly the best team without the ranking to show it. This year, the ranking says Ireland is the best team but without the results to show it.\n\nIreland has been off all year, as if hungover from last year\u2019s great deeds. The attack has particularly struggled. The highest score this year is 29, against Italy. Ireland put 56 and 54 on Italy last year. Winger Jacob Stockdale had eight tries in 10 tests last year. He has four in seven this year. Ireland has been playing closer to the ruck.\n\nThey ought to reach the quarterfinals in good shape as winner of Pool A from Scotland, Japan, Samoa, and Russia.\n\nThe Irish have never passed the quarterfinals, and here looms a crunch matchup against New Zealand or South Africa that could prolong their World Cup misery.\n\nIf so, the depth of the squad won\u2019t be an excuse. Schmidt drummed it into his employers after the 2015 World Cup that he was going to build depth. He went into the quarterfinal against Argentina without captain Paul O\u2019Connell, Sexton, Sean O\u2019Brien, Peter O\u2019Mahony, and Jared Payne through injury or suspension, and was outclassed by the Pumas.\n\nIn his last days in the Ireland job, Schmidt has succeeded in his mission: Every position is covered with strong backup. They just need to lose that hangover.\n\n__\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After his top-ranked All Blacks lost to the Irish last November in Dublin, coach Steve Hansen hailed Ireland as the best team in the world.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/rugby_wcup_ireland_34476_c0-225-4620-2918_s1770x1032.jpg?7b85a5718d7002491cfc1bbace7e27da70b03c34", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
