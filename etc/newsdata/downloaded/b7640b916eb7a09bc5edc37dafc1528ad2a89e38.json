He\u2019s at two to three percent in polling, his big anti-gun push after the El Paso shooting hasn\u2019t done much for him except give him a few viral video moments, so he has nothing left to lose by indulging his most progressive instincts and hoping the base responds.\n\nSix months ago he might have filled in the blank in \u201c_______________ is a human right\u201d with \u201ceducation\u201d or \u201chealth care.\u201d Six months later, as he\u2019s circling the drain, he needs to stand out from the pack. And so instead we get \u201cliving close-ish to your place of employment.\u201d W-w-what?\n\nWhat I\u2019m calling the \u201cMad Libs\u201d phase others are calling the \u201cf*** it\u201d phase of Betomania, with the candidate himself seemingly in agreement.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about O\u2019Rourke at this moment is not just that he\u2019s saying f*** a whole bunch\u2014he\u2019s always dropped curse words on the stump\u2014but that he\u2019s entered more broadly a new phase of his 2020 bid, which supporters find inspiring and critics consider desperate to the point of pathetic. Up close, though, it feels actually pretty compelling\u2026 \u201cHe has no f***s to give,\u201d added Jay Surdukowski, an attorney and activist who is one of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s most devoted backers in New Hampshire. \u201cThis feels right to me,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said when I asked him about how he\u2019s currently campaigning when he met with reporters by the stainless-steel beer tanks at Backlash. He said this was \u201cthe way politics should be.\u201d\u2026 Some see this as \u201cglorified performance art,\u201d \u201ca caricature of authenticity,\u201d but it\u2019s working for Wright. \u201cBeto\u2019s not afraid to say things,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to say it like it is. For those people that say, \u2018Oh, Trump says it like it is,\u2019 well, guess what, let\u2019s go head to head.\u201d\n\nShould we ban sales of assault weapons? F*** it, says Beto, let\u2019s confiscate the ones that are already on the streets. Are the people who voted for Trump in 2016, whose support Democrats are now seeking, actually deplorable racists? F*** it, says Beto. They sure are.\n\nWe\u2019re maybe a week away from this guy endorsing open borders. Right, I know, he\u2019s already sort of endorsed them. I mean overtly, though: \u201cMigration to America is a human right.\u201d He\u2019s already torched his appeal to centrists in Texas, making it that much harder for him to run statewide again. He might as well go all-in in his new role as the progressive id. F*** it.\n\nThere are, of course, more reasonable ways to encourage mixed-income neighborhoods than declaring a human right to a shorter commute but \u201cregulatory reform\u201d doesn\u2019t have the same zing on the stump. This is why so many people, lefties included, are skeptical of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s passionate \u201cf*** it\u201d mode: He\u2019s fundamentally unserious. His proposals seem crafted with little regard for how they might be implemented or what unintended consequences they might create and with maximum regard for their applause quotient. The rap on him from the start among lefties was that he was long on charisma and short on policy chops compared to Bernie and Warren. Ironically, he\u2019s proving their point in straining so hard to tell them what they want to hear.\n\nI assume he has numbers to back up his claim here that the rich on average live closer to work than the working class does but it\u2019s not intuitively true given the tendency of the upper class to cloister itself in neighborhoods that the proles can\u2019t afford. If that means moving further away from the city and enduring a commute, that\u2019s what it means.", "description": "What?", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/b-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
