This is oil country!\u201d\n\nExplaining he had decided to \u201cdeal with it\u201d as soon as he saw photos of the mural on social media, the man reportedly said: \u201cThis is Alberta. This is oil country. My father has worked in the oil industry. We don\u2019t need foreigners coming in and telling us how to run our business, support our families, put food on our tables \u2026 just shut up until you have solutions.\u201d\n\nThe man said his father, who had recently passed away, would have been \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the mural.\n\nLater that day, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that they returned to find another man adding a French slur.\n\nHe also wrote that Ms Thunberg should leave the country. He refused to speak to reporters.\n\nThe Canadian state of Alberta, where Edmonton is situated, is well known for its oil and gas industry.\n\nHome to the country's vast oil sands, the region holds the world\u2019s third-largest crude reserves, but has struggled to recover from the 2014-15 global oil price crash because of delays in building new export pipelines, which have been met with strong opposition from environmental and indigenous groups, as well as regulatory hold-ups.\n\nWith historic ties to the industry, many energy sector workers and the Alberta government feel the oil sands, scorned by environmentalists for their high carbon emissions intensity, have been unfairly targeted. They say the sector is making progress cutting greenhouse gas output.\n\nWorkers\u2019 rights groups have previously called for mass retraining in renewables to ensure former oil and gas employees are not left behind in the ongoing transition. The energy sector provides 150,000 jobs in the region.\n\nThis tension did not go unnoticed during Ms Thunberg\u2019s appearance in Edmonton, the regional capital.\n\nWhile thousands turned out to demonstrate alongside the Swedish activist, holding banners reading \u201cbe a better ancestor\u201d, a small group of counter-protesters led by a truck convoy of oil and gas workers also made their presence felt, their numbers reportedly bolstered by members of far-right groups.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing this because it\u2019s fun or because we have a special interest in the climate or because we want to become politicians when we grow up,\u201d Ms Thunberg said as truck horns blared in the background. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because our future is at stake.\u201d\n\nThe mural\u2019s artist told local media he had been inspired by Ms Thunberg\u2019s speech and wished to keep the conversation going with his artwork.\n\nHe told CBC that he had not been perturbed by the initial pro-oil statement: \u201cNothing lasts forever \u2014 one of my favourite things about that wall is that anyone is allowed to express themselves there, so I\u2019m not upset at all.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen what went over it, but if anyone is upset about what was painted over the portrait, they can just paint back over it, it\u2019s not a big deal at all.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters\n\nRead more\n\nClimate-change campaigners slam Qantas nonstop New York-Sydney flight\n\nMelting permafrost in Siberia is creating climate change refugees\n\nGreta isn\u2019t the only person to miss out on a Nobel Peace Prize\n\nWhy are powerful men so scared of Greta Thunberg?", "description": "A mural of teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has been defaced with pro-oil and derogatory messages days after it was created.The vast artwork appears to depict the Swedish campaigner during her United Nations speech last month when she criticised world leaders for their \u201cbetrayal\u201d of young people", "authors": ["Andy Gregory"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VfmqIZKyYZXiIosvBZcbwg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/a6fa9676e416f1899465212825ddcf2f", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
