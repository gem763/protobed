The movie's conceit is hit-miss, but when it works -- yielding deadpan insults and pained expressions -- there are enough laughs to make digging up \"Ferns\" look like a fine idea.\n\nAgain playing a twisted version of himself, Galifianakis is introduced at a North Carolina public-access station, very uncomfortably interviewing Matthew McConaughey. The chat goes spectacularly wrong, but it's quickly followed by an opportunity: A pitch from Funny or Die's Will Ferrell (playing a Scooby-Doo villain version of himself) to conduct 10 interviews in two weeks, in order to win Galifianakis the actual-network talkshow he craves.\n\nWhat ensues, then, is basically a standard road movie, interspersed with a star-studded array of \"Ferns\" interviews. Galifianakis brings with him quirky sidekicks from the station, including his relentlessly upbeat producer Carol (Lauren Lapkus), who tries to buck up everyone's spirits no matter how terribly events unfold.\n\n\"I want people to laugh with me, not at me,\" Zach proclaims, with the idea that his interviews have turned out to be viral sensations because they're so awful.\n\nZach Galifianakis in 'Between Two Ferns: The Movie'\n\nAs for the who's who of stars to be roasted, they include Keanu Reeves, David Letterman, Brie Larson, Jon Hamm, Peter Dinklage, and Paul Rudd, among others. The best, arguably, involves Chrissy Teigen, although the details are far too good to give away.\n\nRead More", "description": "Zach Galifianakis plants lots of laughs in star-studded Netflix vehicle with Will Ferrell's Funny or Die", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190917075440-between-two-ferns-movie-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
