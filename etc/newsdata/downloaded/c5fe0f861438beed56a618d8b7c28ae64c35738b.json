Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and former Vice President Joe Biden will face off for the first time on Thursday night in Houston, showcasing their significant contrasts in substance and style months before the first votes are cast.\n\nThe stakes are Texas-sized: Biden, who has maintained his lead despite several speaking blunders and prior debate blows, is expected to ding Warren, who is inching up on him with striking consistency. And Warren, who hovers around the number two slot, is likely to push the same progressive policies that have propelled her forward in the primary.\n\nBut Democrats who support Warren don\u2019t want the wonk to attack the wanderer.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to leave the cheap shots to everyone else,\u201d Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh, who has long praised Warren\u2019s career in Massachusetts and presidential candidacy, said. \u201cWarren is on his heels. Biden is looking over his shoulder at her. The side by side comparison is invaluable at this point.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to counter-attack,\u201d Liuba Grechen Shirley, a former New York congressional candidate who is supporting Warren added, saying she\u2019s hoping to hear about her universal child care platform.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator has been steadily gaining ground over the summer, translating her robust grassroots operation and small-dollar fundraising into double digit support in several early state polls. At times edging out Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for a slot just below Biden, it\u2019s the progressive Democrat who is positioned directly next to the former vice president on stage at Texas Southern University.\n\nBiden\u2019s team is reportedly gearing up for a fight, with aides suggesting their candidate will use a portion of his time to call for personal financial transparency among candidates, seen as a potentially veiled attack on Warren. And nearly all Warren enthusiasts interviewed agreed the temptation will be there to take a dig. The two Democrats have fundamentally different track records on addressing corporate interests, one of the biggest components of Warren\u2019s campaign. But most said she wins the night by zooming in on her signature plans, instead of taking a swipe.\n\n\"Since day one, Elizabeth Warren has known who she's fighting for, the American people,\u201d Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA), the Vice Chair of the Democratic caucus, told The Daily Beast. \u201cHer message is resonating because she\u2019s speaking directly to the challenges faced by families every day, whether that's student loan debt or the cost of child care\u2014and she\u2019s got solutions. Voters know that we need her plans and her policies in the White House if we\u2019re going to ensure all Americans have a shot at success.\"\n\nNotably, it\u2019s many of those plans that present a direct contrast to Biden, who\u2019s running a more centrist campaign based largely on electability against President Trump and restoring American values to the White House. But in making that case, some Democrats already spot holes in Biden\u2019s argument as the best fit to take on the current president. It\u2019s not just Warren supporters. Several Democrats in Hillary Clinton\u2019s inner circle, who have not endorsed any candidate, spoke positively about Warren and hoped she wouldn\u2019t get pulled down into a slugfest.\n\n\u201cI expect her to make an electability argument,\u201d Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, said. \u201cShe has a lot of supporters who appreciate her policy and her vision, and she has been gaining in beating Trump.\u201d\n\nPhilippe Reines, a Democratic strategist who has been involved in past presidential debate prep, said her strategy should be consistent. \u201cHere\u2019s what Warren needs to do: keep doing what she\u2019s doing. Ignore DC,\u201d Reines said. \u201cIf she asked for advice it would be simple: declare straight out with all nine of her competitors looking on, \u2018I am the one who can beat Donald Trump.\u2019\u201d\n\nBiden maintains a comfortable lead in many Democratic primary polls. In the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey released earlier this week, he earns 29 percent support to Sanders\u2019 19 percent and Warren\u2019s 18 percent. A more recent poll from the Economist/YouGov places Biden and Warren at a dead heat, each earning 26 percent. But that head start, her supporters argue, doesn\u2019t necessarily predict long-term success for the former vice president.\n\nMatt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, stressed that it\u2019s \u201cunknowable\u201d who can beat Trump and that the debate should focus around the issues voters care most about, many of which provide an opportunity for Warren to present a direct contrast to Biden on stage.\n\n\u201cI would like to see her say something like, \u2018Joe you were wrong on the war in Iraq, you were wrong on credit cards, deregulation, bankruptcy, and there is a value in being right about the big stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Warren\u2019s earliest backers outside of Massachusetts came from freshman Rep. Andy Levin (D-MI), who represents part of Macomb County, a battleground the Democratic nominee would need to capture from Trump in the 2020 general election.\n\nWhile Biden often scores points for perceived electability, Levin said that Warren has the right formula to go head-to-head with Trump there.\n\n\u201cI have tremendous confidence in her,\u201d Levin said about Warren ahead of Thursday night. \u201cShe\u2019s rising because she has as super positive message for the bold change we need.\u201d If attacked, he added, \u201cshe\u2019ll stand up for herself, but she\u2019ll do it in a way that isn\u2019t nasty or tearing anyone else down.\u201d", "description": "Progressives hope the Massachusetts senator won\u2019t go low against the former vice president.", "authors": ["Hanna Trudo"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568301657/190911-trudo-warren-tease_gnv6ce"}
