REUTERS/Jessica Lutz/File Photo\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the International Energy Agency (IEA) both issued reports this week pointing to an oil surplus next year, despite an OPEC-led pact to cut supply that runs until March.\n\n\u201cOil prices have been slipping in recent days even as stock markets have rallied and inventory data has reported large drawdowns,\u201d said Craig Erlam of OANDA. \u201cThe IEA and others continue to downgrade forecasts for demand as global economic growth fears mount.\u201d\n\nBenchmark Brent crude LCOc1 was down 25 cents at $60.13 a barrel by 0830 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate CLc1 was up 5 cents at $55.14.\n\nHopes of progress in the trade dispute lent support. The world\u2019s two largest economies are preparing for a new round of talks aimed at curbing the prolonged spat and have been making conciliatory gestures, cheering investors.\n\n\u201cA wave of optimism is sweeping across financial markets,\u201d said Lukman Otunuga, analyst at broker FXTM, citing \u201coptimism over a potential breakthrough in the U.S.-China trade saga.\u201d\n\nBrent has traded in a range of nearly $5 this week and is heading for its first weekly loss in five weeks. The U.S. benchmark, similarly volatile, was on track for the first weekly drop in three weeks.\n\nBrent is up 12% in 2019, helped by a deal by OPEC and allies including Russia, an alliance known as OPEC+, to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day.\n\nThe producers are trying to stop inventories from building up and, in a sign the plan is bearing fruit, U.S. crude oil stocks fell last week to the lowest in nearly a year.\n\nAn OPEC+ monitoring committee met this week and secured pledges from OPEC members Nigeria and Iraq to deliver their share of the cut, something they have failed to do so far, but made no progress on possibly deepening the supply cut.\n\nSome OPEC delegates say the idea of a larger cut for next year is gaining support. But Saudi Arabia\u2019s new energy minister said talks on that issue would be left until the next OPEC+ meeting in December.", "description": "Oil slipped to around $60 a barrel on Friday as concern about a slowdown in the global economy and oil demand outweighed hints of progress in the U.S.-China trade dispute.", "authors": ["Alex Lawler", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429377066&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0NH", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
