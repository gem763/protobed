Two other soldiers were lightly wounded, it said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the attack was related to Turkey's invasion of northeast Syria against Kurdish forces. Tens of thousands of people have been driven from their homes ahead of the Turkish advance.\n\nTurkey views the Kurdish fighters as terrorists because of their links to a decades-long insurgency in the country's southeast.\n\nIn this photo taken from the Turkish side of the border between Turkey and Syria, in Ceylanpinar, Sanliurfa province, southeastern Turkey, smoke billows from targets in Ras al-Ayn, Syria, caused by shelling by Turkish forces, Friday, Oct. 18, 2019.

An Iranian Kurdish militant group, also accused of links to Kurdish insurgents in Turkey, operates there.\n\n___\n\n11:30 a.m.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has met with Israel's prime minister to reaffirm the countries' close ties at a time when many in Israel fear the Trump administration intends to give up on the Middle East.\n\nIn brief remarks after their meeting, Pompeo praised the \"remarkable, close relationship\" with Israel and said they discussed efforts to counter Iran and other challenges in the region. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Pompeo for America's \"consistent support.\"\n\nNetanyahu is a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump and welcomed his decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nBut Trump's decision to abandon America's Syrian Kurdish allies in the face of Turkey's offensive in northern Syria, along with other recent moves, has raised concerns that Trump might not be a reliable ally.\n\nWhen asked about a U.S.-brokered cease-fire on Thursday aimed at halting the fighting in Syria, Netanyahu said \"we hope things will turn out for the best.\"\n\n___\n\n11:20 a.m.\n\nTurkey's pro-government dominated media is hailing the U.S.-Turkish cease-fire deal in northeast Syria as a victory for Turkey's president.\n\nAfter hours of negotiations between Recep Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, the two nations agreed to a five-day cease-fire in Turkey's weeklong offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria.\n\nThe agreement requires the Kurdish fighters to vacate a swath of territory inside Syria along the Turkish border. That arrangement would largely solidify the position Turkey has gained after ten days of fighting. The Kurds were U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nYeni Safak newspaper's banner headline on Friday hailed a \"Great Victory.\" It wrote: \"Turkey got everything it wanted.\"\n\nSabah newspaper's headline read: \"We won both on the field and on the (negotiating) table.\"\n\nKurdish-led forces have invited the Syrian government's military, backed by Russia, to deploy there to protect them from Turkey.\n\n___\n\n9:20 a.m.\n\nAssociated Press journalists are seeing continued fighting in a Syrian town at the center of the fight between Turkey and Kurdish forces, despite a U.S.-brokered cease-fire.\n\nShelling and smoke could be seen around Ras al-Ayn on Friday morning, a day after Turkey and the U.S. agreed to a five-day cease-fire in Turkey's offensive.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, reports intermittent clashes in Ras al-Ayn, but relative calm elsewhere since the cease-fire.\n\nThe agreement requires the Kurdish fighters to vacate a swath of territory in Syria along the Turkish border, largely solidifying Turkey's position.\n\nTurkish troops and Turkish-backed Syrian fighters launched their offensive a week ago, two days after U.S. President Donald Trump suddenly announced he was withdrawing American troops from the border area.\n\nChildren gesture to the camera in Akcakale Sanliurfa province, southeastern Turkey, at the border with Syria, Friday, Oct. 18, 2019.
