In August 2018, car makers ramped up sales ahead of the introduction of new emissions rules, leading to double-digit growth in many European markets.\n\nThe association, whose members include Europe\u2019s biggest car makers, said the drop in demand was led by Spain and France, where sales fell 31% and 14%, respectively. New car sales were 0.8% lower in Germany and fell 3.1% in Italy, while the UK recorded a 1.6% decline.", "description": "New car sales in the European Union fell in August with the bloc\u2019s five major markets recording decreases, according to data published on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Dow Jones Newswires"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GY143_bmw110_ZG_20181108000043.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
