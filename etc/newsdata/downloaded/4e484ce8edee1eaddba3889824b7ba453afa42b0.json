Mitt Romney on Monday evening for losing the 2012 presidential election.\n\nMr. Trump took to Twitter to post a video consisting of a montage of short clips from presidential election-night coverage in 2012 and 2016, detailing Mr. Romney\u2019s loss to President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump\u2019s victory over former first lady Hillary Clinton.\n\nMr. Trump posted the 39-second segment without comment. But his words came just a few hours after Mr. Romney had said that the White House should turn over the transcript of a now-notorious phone call between Mr. Trump and the president of Ukraine.\n\nThe clip included footage of Mr. Trump repeating his longstanding disparagement of Mr. Romney saying of the 2012 election that \u201cthat was a race, I have to say folks, that should have been won.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
