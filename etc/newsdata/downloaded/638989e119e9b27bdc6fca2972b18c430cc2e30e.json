Analysts expect the ride-sharing technology company to lose another 83 cents per share, over $920 million, for the September quarter, on revenue of $3.74 billion.\n\nThe balance sheet in June showed Uber with cash of $11.88 billion. In theory that\u2019s enough to survive for almost three years, if the cash burn can be held down to expected levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut can it? Investors are starting to bet it can\u2019t.\n\nA Closer Look at Uber Stock\n\nOf roughly seven million shares per day currently traded in Uber 33%, are being sold short. By way of comparison, the comparable figure for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), long one of the most popular shorts on the market, is 12%.\n\nShort interest can hold a stock\u2019s price up because shorts are borrowing the shares they\u2019ve sold and must at some point buy them back. Almost any sign of good news, even the absence of bad news, can trigger a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d The stock price rises and the loans used to sell shares get called in.\n\nAn upside surprise next month could cause a dramatic jump in Uber\u2019s stock price. But if you\u2019re betting on that the odds don\u2019t look good right now.\n\nDriver Liabilities and Uber Stock\n\nUber profit depends on either paying drivers less or getting more from riders and neither seems likely.\n\nUber faces competition with Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) against any price rise. Customers have learned to organize and arbitrage the services against one another.\n\nThe California legislature, meanwhile, is fighting to raise Uber\u2019s driving costs. AB5 would reclassify drivers in that state from contractors to employees. It could be signed as early as this week.\n\nUber wants to be exempt. It promises an initiative campaign against the law if it\u2019s not. But an initiative can\u2019t happen until next year. Drivers are still classed as contractors under federal labor law but are working in other large markets, like New York and Chicago, for better conditions.\n\nLabor peace isn\u2019t around the corner.\n\nOld-World Problems and Uber Stock\n\nUber is fighting its problems in a 19th century way.\n\nIt already has a program to help drivers get cars, and is now interested in offering them payday loans, as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) already does. Existing payday lenders already target drivers, especially when their cars need repair.\n\nThe difference is that Walmart is loaning money to employees. Uber\u2019s loans would be going to contractors. Critics say this could make Uber drivers into indentured servants, digital sharecroppers forced to keep working to get out of debt with interest they can\u2019t pay back.\n\nOn top of this comes a book from New York Times reporter Mike Isaac charging that Uber\u2019s corporate culture doomed it to failure.\n\nSuper Pumped claims Uber\u2019s \u201csafe rides fee\u201d delivered nothing but cash into the company\u2019s pocket. Isaac says Uber routinely puts female drivers in danger and covers up sexual abuse by executives.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Uber Stock\n\nCEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who joined from Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) two years ago, has been unable to lift Uber\u2019s reputation so far.\n\nUber\u2019s problems may help investors obtain better pricing on coming IPOs like WeWork and Peloton. Funds that specialize in newly-public companies have big winners like Spotify (NASDAQ:SPOT), Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) to cover up Uber\u2019s pain. They seem resigned to a loss on Uber.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.
