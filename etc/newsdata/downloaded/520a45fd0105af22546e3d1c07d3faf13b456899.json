The Chinese consulate in Houston also scolded the Rockets, saying: \"We have lodged representations and expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Houston Rockets... Anybody with conscience would support the efforts made by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to safeguard Hong Kong\u2019s social stability.\"\n\nBut American lawmakers, including from the team's home state of Texas, accused the Rockets and the NBA of appeasing a repressive Chinese government out of concern for their financial interests. The NBA is investing heavily in China, a market with 1.4 billion potential fans and a deep connection to Houston -- Hall of Fame center and former Rocket Yao Ming, the legendary Chinese basketball player, is president of China's official basketball association.\n\n\"As a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party's repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tweeted. \"Now, in pursuit of big $$, the @nba is shamefully retreating.\"\n\nHONG KONG'S LAM BANS MASKS UN HARDENING STANCE ON PROTESTS\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro, a Democratic presidential candidate from Texas, also issued a strong condemnation of China's treatment of protesters in the semi-autonomous former British colony of Hong Kong, who are advocating for increased freedom and democracy as they rail against what they say is oppression coming from Beijing.\n\n\"China is using its economic power to silence critics\u2014even those in the U.S.,\" Castro tweeted. \"The United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government.\"\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, backed Castro, tweeting that he was glad to agree with the one-time Obama Housing and Urban Development secretary.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Sunday that he found the acquiescence to China from the NBA and the Rockets \"unacceptable.\"\n\n'Basketball fans and the American people more broadly should have absolutely no doubt about what is happening here: The NBA wants money, and the Communist Party of China is asking them to deny the most basic of human rights. In response, the NBA issued a statement saying money is the most important thing.' \u2014 Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb.\n\nCHINESE SUSPEND WORK WITH HOUSTON ROCKETS AFTER GM'S HONG KONG TWEET\n\n\"No one should implement a gag rule on Americans speaking out for freedom,\" he tweeted Monday morning. \"I stand with the people of Hong Kong in their pursuit of democratic rights. I stand with Americans who want to voice their support for the people of Hong Kong.\"\n\nOther prominent lawmakers expressing concern about the reaction to Morey's tweet included Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Ben Sasse, R-Neb. Sasse accused the NBA of putting money ahead of human rights in a scathing reproach Monday morning.\n\n\"Basketball fans and the American people more broadly should have absolutely no doubt about what is happening here: The NBA wants money, and the Communist Party of China is asking them to deny the most basic of human rights,\" he said. \"In response, the NBA issued a statement saying money is the most important thing.\"\n\nRockets owner Tilman Fertitta was quick to distance the team from Morey's statement on Friday. Quoting Morey's now-deleted post, he said that the GM spoke only for himself and emphasized the Rockets are \"NOT a political organization.\"\n\nHouston Rockets star and 2017-18 NBA Most Valuable Player James Harden also distanced himself from Morey's post supporting freedom in Hong Kong.\n\nGOP LAWMAKERS SLAM CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY'S 'APPALING RECORD OF REPRESSION' ON 70th ANNIVERSARY\n\n\"We apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there,\u201d Harden said, according to ESPN. \u201cFor both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love.\"\n\nThe NBA's official English-language statement on the matter expressed regret to \"our friends and fans in China\" without directly condemning Morey.\n\n\"We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,\" it said.\n\nThe league's statement on its official Chinese social media account, however, took a different tone.\n\nHONG KONG PROTESTERS DEFY MASK BAN IN NEW ROUND OF DEMONSTRATIONS, AS CITY BRACES FOR MORE\n\nThe NBA said Monday on that account that it was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by Morey\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d tweet about Hong Kong, which \u201cseverely hurt the feelings of Chinese fans.\u201d\n\nSimilarly harsh toward Morey was a long statement by Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai.\n\n\"Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China,\" he wrote in a Facebook post. \"1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country\u2019s sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis controversy comes after many American politicians issued rebukes of the Chinese Communist Party last week on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\"To see the price of the [People's Republic of China's] anniversary celebration, look no further than what's happening in Hong Kong: a ceaseless war against those who wish to live in freedom,\" Sen. Tom Cotton R-Ark., said. \"From the Great Leap Forward to the Cultural Revolution to the camps in Xinjiang today, it has been a ghoulish 70 years of Chinese Communist Party control.\"\n\nSome Republicans broke with President Trump in those statements, however, as the president tweeted his congratulations to China on the anniversary.\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos and David Aaro, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Lawmakers\u00a0from across the political spectrum came together Monday \u2013 if only for a moment \u2013 to slam\u00a0the NBA for essentially apologizing\u00a0to China over a tweet by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey that expressed support for pro-democracy\u00a0protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Sen.
