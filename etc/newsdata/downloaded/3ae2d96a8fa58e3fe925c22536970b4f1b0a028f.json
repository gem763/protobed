Middle aged women aren\u2019t the only ones who are suffering.\n\nTense vaginal muscles \u2013 caused by not being fully aroused, anxiety, over painful sex in the past, or past trauma like sexual assault - can also cause pain at any age.\n\nOther causes of painful sex include vaginismus (an involuntary tightening of the outer third of the vagina that makes penetration difficult or impossible), high-tone, pelvic floor dysfunction (when the muscles that support the vagina, bladder, and rectum become tense and can\u2019t relax) and yeast infections, cystitis or STI\u2019s (which make our vaginas feel sore and irritated).\n\nThen there is pelvic pain is caused by adhesions, endometriosis (scar tissue), fibroids and cysts. Hysterectomy and other pelvic surgery can sometimes end up making intercourse painful. As can some cancer treatments.\n\nThe list of causes is long, exhaustive \u2013 and exhausting and frustrating for sufferers.\n\nHappily, there\u2019s a lot you can do to alleviate the problem.\n\n10 WAYS TO PREVENT PAINFUL SEX\n\nAsk what\u2019s available to treat your specific condition.\n\nDrug names and treatments change constantly, so there\u2019s no point in me naming specific medications, but there usually is a treatment for most conditions.\n\nIt might be a pill or cream or vaginal pessary. It might involve doing some \u2018homework\u2019, like pelvic floor exercises (see below).\n\nSometimes, though, the treatment doesn\u2019t work \u2013 or there isn\u2019t one.\n\nIn that case, the only option might be to avoid intercourse entirely and redefine sex.\n\nThat sounds extreme but it\u2019s completely possible to enjoy non-penetrative sex sessions \u2013 some women enjoy them more than they did sex that revolved around intercourse.\n\nMutual masturbation, oral sex, extended foreplay \u2013 intercourse isn\u2019t the only sexual activity that ends in orgasm!\n\nAlways add lube before penetration.\n\nJust one third of women in the Durex study said they\u2019d use lube with a partner \u2013 despite nine in 10 saying sex felt better when they did.\n\nSex expert Tracey Cox revealed why increasing numbers of women are finding sex painful and offered her top tips to make intercourse more pleasurable\n\nThis is bonkers.\n\nBoth men and women are guilty of thinking that not being \u2018wet\u2019 means you\u2019re not \u2018turned on enough\u2019 or that there\u2019s something \u2018wrong\u2019 with you.\n\nFalse.\n\nYou can be aroused and still not be wet: it all depends on what\u2019s causing the vaginal dryness.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want your partner to know you\u2019re using lube (and quite frankly, I\u2019d ditch my partner rather than the lube if they had a problem with it), insert it high into the vagina five minutes before you have sex and let it work its way down naturally.\n\nUsing lube is an essential, not a luxury.\n\nYou might also want to team it with a vaginal moisturiser.\n\nThey\u2019re different from lubes: you use them even when you\u2019re not having sex to keep everything moist and comfortable.\n\nGo for one that doesn\u2019t contain parabens or aspartame and insert before bedtime.\n\nDouble the time you spend on foreplay\n\nSkilful foreplay is enormously important and certainly helps to make intercourse feel far more comfortable.\n\nForty-two percent of the women in the Durex survey blamed their partner for painful sex caused by dryness, saying they \u2018didn\u2019t know how to pleasure them\u2019.\n\nThis might be true. But if it is, speak up!\n\nTell them what techniques work for you and what don\u2019t.\n\nYour partner isn\u2019t a mind reader: be honest about what\u2019s enjoyable and what isn\u2019t.\n\nTake time to relax into sex.\n\nPut some lubricant on the head of his penis and use it to stroke the vulva, over the clitoris and around the opening, to get ready for penetration.\n\nHer advice includes doubling the amount of time spent on foreplay, always adding lube or even using a squishy 'buffer' ring\n\nDon\u2019t rush it, take it slowly.\n\nHaving an orgasm before penetration also helps to relax the vagina.\n\nChoose positions that don\u2019t allow deep penetration.\n\nThe position chosen accounts for 42 per cent of women\u2019s pain on penetration.\n\nAny position where you\u2019re in control, rather than him, works (you on top, for instance). Otherwise, choose positions where you\u2019re both lying fairly flat with your own legs quite close together.\n\nSpooning sex works well, as does doggy style but with both of you lying flat with his legs on either side of yours.\n\nPractice relaxing your vaginal muscles.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to do pelvic floor exercises: repetitively squeezing and releasing the same muscles you use to cut off a flow of urine.\n\nMost women assume it\u2019s the \u2018squeeze\u2019 that\u2019s the most important part of \u2018kegel\u2019 exercises but the \u2018release\u2019 part is just as important.\n\nTake your time when doing them and consciously relax the muscles around your vagina.\n\nBreathe. Focus.\n\nUse a kegel training kit\n\nGo one step further to build muscle strength in your pelvic floor: this will also help to prevent pain.\n\nHow to deal with painful sex Never attempt to self-medicate with vaginal or pelvic pain you absolutely must seek medical help: Dr Google is not a reliable source for solving health problems. Only a qualified doctor can do that. The first step is always to see your doctor. If your doctor is the sort you know will be embarrassed, ask to see a female doctor. Believe me, she\u2019s seen and heard it all before. Don\u2019t be fobbed off with the advice that using a good lube is all you need. Lube helps but it\u2019s not going to make a scrap of difference in a lot of cases. If you don\u2019t think your doctor is knowledgeable enough or dismissive, ask for a referral to see a gynaecologist or genital urinary specialist. A good gynaecologist can change your life. If you\u2019re plagued with problems and can afford it, it\u2019s worth paying to see one that\u2019s private and highly recommended (even if you go just for one session). A good sex therapist may also be useful. Medication or another treatment might sort the physical problem, but painful sex impacts your whole relationship. It makes you nervous about having it and your partner worry you don\u2019t find them attractive. Some men think women make it up to get out of sex.\n\nKegel training kits are weighted, insertable balls. You start on the lightest weight and build up to the heaviest.\n\nInsert high into the vagina and then do your usual pelvic floor exercises \u2013 repetitively squeezing and releasing \u2013 around the toner ball.\n\nChange his thrusting style\n\nThis is an instant fix \u2013 and for some a life changer.\n\nInstead of him using the traditional thrusting method of pulling out then penetrating deeply, switch to a grinding circular motion.\n\nGet him to penetrate slowly, stopping every inch, to let you relax around him. Once he\u2019s fully penetrated, keep your pelvises close and grind together in a circular motion.\n\nHe can put his hands under your buttocks to lift your bottom towards him \u2013 just make sure to keep the grinding slow and consistent.\n\nDeep, hard, old-style thrusting is almost certainly going to cause pain if you have any issues.\n\nUse a \u2018buffer\u2019\n\nYou can buy squishy rings that sit at the base of his penis to stop him penetrating deeply during intercourse.\n\nIf he\u2019s wearing a buffer, he can thrust away without having to worry about going too deep, and you can relax, knowing it\u2019s not going to hurt if he does get carried away.\n\n\u2018Ohnut\u2019 is one brand: nice and stretchy and formulated to prevent painful sex. It works very well.\n\nHead to one of the large sex toy retailers and do a search online for a \u2018bumper intimacy cushion\u2019 or \u2018mini-head stroker\u2019 and you\u2019ll see other choices.\n\nYou can also stack a few penis rings to make a larger one, which works on the same principle.\n\nAgain, this is an instant fix that can make a huge difference.\n\nAdd oestrogen if you\u2019re pre or post-menopausal.\n\nOestrogen pessaries can make an enormous difference if vaginal dryness if causing the pain.\n\nYou could also ask your doctor if you\u2019re suitable for an oestrogen ring which also helps to up the flexibility and thickness of the vaginal wall.\n\nVisit traceycox.com for more information about sex and relationships and to see Tracey\u2019s product ranges.", "description": "Sex expert Tracey Cox has revealed why increasing numbers of women are finding sex painful and offered her top ten tips on how to make intercourse more pleasurable.", "authors": ["Tracey Cox For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/15/20040376-0-image-a-75_1571755911812.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
