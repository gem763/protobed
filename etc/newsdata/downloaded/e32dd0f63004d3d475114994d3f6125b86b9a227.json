Pictured, Verdigris Roundhead seen at the RHS Garden Hyde Hall in Essex\n\nThe Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) said that the damp summer and wet autumn weather has meant that many highly unusual species of fungi have been spotted in their gardens around the country.\n\nEarthstars, which release a puff of spores when pressed, are flourishing at their garden at Wisley in Surrey.\n\nA puffball mushroom bigger than a human head was also found at Wisley, as was a dead man\u2019s fingers.\n\nBirkshead Gardens and Nursery in Newcastle also had puffballs bigger than footballs and the common stinkhorn, a suggestively-shaped mushroom that \u2018looked so rude, it offended a visitor\u2019 and was pulled up, the RHS said.\n\nDevil\u2019s fingers, also known as octopus stinkhorn, has been spotted at RHS Garden Rosemoor in North Devon, while scarlet catterpilarclub and orange peel fungi have been spotted at its garden at Harlow Carr, Harrogate, North Yorkshire.\n\nHyde Hall in Essex saw the odd, shiny green mushroom verdigris agaric, and the delicate magpie inkcap.\n\nIt has been horrible weather for drying clothes or having a barbecue, but the soggy conditions we have experienced in recent months have been favourable for fungi. Pictured, Devil's fingertips growing in RHS Garden Rosemoor in North Devon\n\nThe varieties of mushrooms that have been flourishing include giant puffballs and fly agaric, as well as the scarily-named dead man\u2019s fingers and devil\u2019s fingertip. Pictured, Minterne Gardens, in Dorset\n\nAs well as these picturesque species, the repulsively-named slime mould known as dog vomit has been found at Sherborne Castle, Dorset.\n\nRobert Brett, the curator at RHS Garden Hyde Hall, said: \u2018We are seeing a lot more fungi here this year than previous years and it is definitely due to all the wet weather. We are in one of the driest areas of the country so it\u2019s proof that mushrooms love the rain.\u2019\n\nMichael Jordan, chairman of The Fungus Conservation Trust, recently led a fungi foray at RHS partner garden Hestercombe House and Gardens in Somerset, where they recorded an unprecedented 102 species in two hours.\n\nHe said: \u2018Fungi usually start \u2018fruiting\u2019 from late July, peak through September and October, and end in early December. We are seeing a significant flush emerging right now, brought on by the ideal summer and autumn weather.\u2019\n\nThe Royal Horticultural Society said that the damp summer and wet autumn weather has meant that many highly unusual species of fungi have been spotted in their gardens around the country.

We are in one of the driest areas of the country so it\u2019s proof that mushrooms love the rain.\u2019 Pictured, Dead Man's Fingers in RHS Garden Wisley\n\nGuy Barter, chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society, said: \u2018We have a visual feast of fungi across our gardens at the moment. Fairy rings are annoying on lawns, but for the most part fungi are beneficial to gardeners.\n\n\u2018They break down organic matter in the soil and elsewhere, turning it into plant food. They also feed a host of microbes which are important for biodiversity.\n\n\u2018Some are associated with plant roots and in exchange for sugars with which to grow, can protect roots from attack by harmful organisms and may supply the roots with water and nutrients in times of shortage.\u2019\n\nOne fungus is perhaps less welcome, the RHS said. Honey fungus is the bane of gardeners as it attacks and kills the roots of many plants and is very hard to kill.\n\nRHS plant scientists are working to combat its threat, recently releasing research on plants which are resistant to it.\n\nMeripilus giganteus is another harmful kind, which causes a white rot in the roots of various types of broadleaved trees, chiefly beech.\n\nA so-called \u2018Corpse Plant\u2019, seen in Sherborne Castle and Gardens in Dorset", "description": "The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) said the damp summer and wet autumn weather has meant many highly unusual species of fungi have been spotted at its gardens around the UK.", "authors": ["Colin Fernadez Science Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/16/19998258-0-image-a-62_1571672996604.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
