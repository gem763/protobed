Controversial CMO Ed Razek stepped down, the brand hired its first openly transgender model and it seems to have full support from its parent company.\n\n\u201cOur number 1 priority continues to be improving performance at Victoria\u2019s Secret,\u201d L Brands said on its earnings call last week.\n\nBut Agdal, who\u2019s modeled for the brand in the past, said it might just be too little, too late.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that they're starting to include different body types and different people and women because that is just so needed,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDo I think it's ironic that they had to hit rock bottom before they went there? Maybe a little bit. Am I happy that it\u2019s all happening? Yes,\u201d she added.\n\nA struggle with \u2018sexy\u2019\n\nCompetitors like Aerie (AEO), which brands itself as the \u201canti Victoria\u2019s Secret\u201d and uses untouched advertisements and body-positive campaigns, are adding to the brand\u2019s struggle for relevancy. Consumer sentiment surrounding the definition of \u201csexy\u201d continues to evolve.\n\nMeanwhile, the demise of one of its biggest events means the company won\u2019t be as prominent in the public\u2019s eye. Agdal told Yahoo Finance she had mixed feelings about the state of affairs.\n\n\u201cThe Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion show is not happening this year. I\u2019m sad for the girls who do it because they love it so much and that\u2019s their yearly \u2018thing,\u2019\u201d Agdal said.\n\n\u201cBut I can also say that the way it was promoted \u2014 with the amount of workouts and all the pressure that you have to be really toned, lean and skinny \u2014 that does create a certain perception for young girls out there that\u2019s not healthy,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy they\u2019re taking the steps towards it but there\u2019s still a long way to go,\u201d Agdal said.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead more:", "description": "Supermodel Nina Agdal weighs in on Victoria's Secret as the brand continues to struggle.", "authors": ["Alexandra Canal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OyPH3noJX5es1gJKE6JWAA--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-02/9d7d2bb0-3133-11e9-9c73-14ca829c786f", "published_at": "2019-09-01"}
