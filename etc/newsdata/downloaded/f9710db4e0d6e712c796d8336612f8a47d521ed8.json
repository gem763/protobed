The move signals a departure from long-standing US counter-terrorism strategy in Syria, which hinged on a close partnership with Kurdish-led forces to combat ISIS.\n\nIn discontinuing that approach, the Trump administration has effectively ceded influence in northern Syria to Assad and his allies and raised the specter of a resurgent ISIS. Over recent days, Kurdish authorities have reported the escape of hundreds of ISIS family members from a camp in northern Syria, and warned that ISIS militants held in prisons could be next to go if fighting with Turkish forces continues to escalate.\n\nThe situation began to deteriorate last week when the Trump administration ordered US troops to step aside from the border in northern Syria, effectively paving the way for Turkey to launch its offensive against the Kurds, who they regard as enemies.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who operate in the area are led by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which Turkey considers a terrorist organization affiliated with the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says the incursion into Syria is aimed at clearing a \"safe zone\" along the border to resettle some two million Syrian refugees currently hosted in Turkey.\n\nBut there are growing concerns over the safety of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Turkey's path, as Kurdish-controlled towns come under heavy fire, key border towns are seized and main roads are cut off.\n\nAmid the chaos over the weekend, a grisly video began circulating on social media that appeared to show the execution-style killing of a prominent Kurdish politician, as well as her driver, members of Kurdish security forces and several civilians by Turkish-backed militants\n\nThe Free Syrian Army or FSA (also called the Syrian National Army), have denied those claims. CNN could not independently verify the video.\n\nAssad's soldiers helping Kurdish forces\n\nUnits from the Syrian army reportedly arrived in northern towns Monday, after reaching an agreement with the Kurds to deploy troops along the entirety of Syria-Turkey border.\n\nSyrian state media shared footage that it described as showing local residents welcoming the regime forces.\n\nThe new agreement between the Kurds and Damascus represents a new alliance in an area already saturated with infighting.\n\nKey Kurdish factions, explained Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF): Coalition of Kurdish and Arab fighters who are allied with the US in the war against ISIS. People's Protection Units (YPG): Kurdish militia which forms the backbone of the SDF and wants an independent Kurdish state in Syria. Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK): Kurdish separatist group linked to the YPG, considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and US.\n\nAn autonomous administration set up by the Kurds, which covers a wide swathe of north and east Syria, said Sunday that it was the Syrian government's duty to protect its borders and sovereignty.\n\n\"This agreement offers an opportunity to liberate the rest of the Syrian territories and cities occupied by the Turkish army as Afrin and other Syrian cities and towns,\" the statement said.\n\nThe group added on Monday that is was in the process of agreeing a \"memorandum of understanding\" on the protection of the border with the Russian side.\n\nThe deal means that Kurdish forces, who were considered vital US allies in the fight against ISIS, would be fighting alongside allies of President Bashar al-Assad's regime.\n\nThe Syrian government has not commented on such an agreement.\n\nAnd, despite reports of the new partnership, Ankara said Monday it would move forward with its plans for the northeastern Syrian town of Manbij.\n\n\"The plan is not for Turkey to go into Manbij, the plan is for the rightful owners of the area -- the Arabs, the tribes from that area who we are in touch with, to go in,\" Erdogan told reporters at Istanbul Airport.\n\n\"Our approach is for them to go in and for us to provide security for them.\"\n\nISIS families escape from camp\n\nBut Turkey's incursion has been condemned for undermining the stability and security of the whole region, raising fears that the chaos it has created could give rise to an ISIS 2.0.\n\nTurkey and the Kurds have said they would work to ensure the safety of ISIS prisons during the offensive, but as the state of play on the ground continues to shift, so too do conflicting reports over how that threat is being handled.\n\nOn Monday, Turkey claimed that a jail holding ISIS fighters was emptied by the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), which controls the area now under attack. The allegation came a day after Kurdish authorities said that 785 people affiliated with foreign ISIS fighters escaped from Ain Issa, an encampment for displaced people, as a result of the fighting. Erdogan suggested the reports were \"disinformation,\" designed to \"provoke the US and Europe.\"\n\nCNN was unable to verify either of the claims.\n\nTrump, who has warned he would \"obliterate\" Turkey's economy if it does not contain the ISIS threat, alleged that the SDF was intentionally releasing ISIS fighters.\n\n\"Kurds may be releasing some to get us involved. Easily recaptured by Turkey or European Nations from where many came, but they should move quickly. Big sanctions on Turkey coming! Do people really think we should go to war with NATO Member Turkey? Never ending wars will end!\" Trump tweeted on Monday\n\nBut, US officials have told CNN there are no indications the SDF have intentionally released any of the 10,000-plus ISIS prisoners in their custody as part of a bid to draw international support.\n\nPhotos: Turkey launches military offensive in Syria People in Qamishli, Syria, attend a funeral Monday, October 14, for five fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces.

They could also try and retake the land of the caliphate, disappear back in to ungoverned territory to regroup or a combination of all of that. Dealing with the last two would be a major challenge without a committed ground force as you can't just use air power,\" the official said.\n\n'Blood on Trump's hands'\n\nJUST WATCHED Turkish operation in Syria threatens civilians Replay More Videos ...
