Kiffin tagged Conference USA's Twitter account in the post.\n\n\"Conference USA has specific rules and standards regarding sportsmanship which have been adopted by our membership,\" Conference USA commissioner Judy MacLeod said in a statement. \"We have an obligation to enforce our rules including the prohibition of public criticism of officiating.\"\n\nKiffin had said after the game that he wouldn't comment of calls during the loss. He talked to reporters on a conference call Sunday night about his tweet.\n\n\"Obviously I wasn't very happy with the officials during the game,\" Kiffin said, according to the Sun-Sentinel newspaper in South Florida. \"I thought what I sent was kind of a funny tweet. I guess they didn't think it was as funny as I did. I guess there's no freedom to tweet around here.\"\n\nKiffin told reporters that the league office acknowledged some officiating inaccuracies during the game, with any repercussions handled internally.\n\n\"What's that going to do for us? Nothing,\" Kiffin said. \"It's not like we're going to win the game or something.\"\n\nThe Owls are 4-3 overall and 2-1 in Conference USA.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Florida Atlantic coach Lane Kiffin tweeted a comment Saturday about Conference  USA officiating, which drew a $5,000 fine and formal reprimand from the...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
