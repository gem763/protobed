Many of the best things about observing the occasion in India have nothing to do with what are here called \u201ccrackers\u201d \u2013 we lit clay oil lamps to celebrate light\u2019s victory over darkness, offered puja (prayers) to Laxmi, the goddess of prosperity, played games, listened to music and ate warming home-cooked food.\n\nBut in the park square outside the house, children from the neighbourhood ran amok with armfuls of rockets, sparklers, catherine wheels and other gunpowder-fuelled inventions.\n\nIn the grand scheme of polluting factors contributing to Delhi\u2019s unacceptably bad air, even last year\u2019s particularly high Diwali emissions registered as only a passing blip compared to the full winter season of smog.\n\nThe Indian authorities\u2019 efforts to raise awareness of the polluting impacts of fireworks should be welcomed, but officials and the media must also do more to tackle the less obvious, more politically challenging causes of smog that include regional crop burning, construction and major industry.\n\nSimplistic reports with an excessive focus on Diwali as the root of the pollution problem let the other offenders off the hook, and risk sparking long-term rifts between neighbours at a time that should be about celebrating communal goodwill.\n\nYours,\n\nAdam Withnall\n\nAsia editor", "description": "Delhi may have banned Diwali fireworks back in 2018, but the night sky exploded with colour once again on Sunday for the Hindu festival of lights.", "authors": ["Adam Withnall"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/18/Delhi-pollution.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
