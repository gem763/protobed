The survey, conducted by Ipsos for the Polish website OKO.press, suggested that a government campaign against the nebulous concept of \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d was having an impact.\n\nIn Poland, and elsewhere in central Europe, there has been a notable rise in tolerance and empathy towards the LGBT community in recent years, illustrated by the emergence of a confident new generation of activists in smaller towns and cities. But across the region, populist politicians and church leaders are using the issue to mobilise their conservative bases.\n\nOn Thursday, the continent\u2019s biggest annual gathering of LGBT activists was told that the iron curtain that once divided Europe between communist east and capitalist west remained intact for gay and transgender people, amid a rising tide of homophobic hatred, violence and discrimination.\n\nAd\u00e9la Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1, an advocacy director at the Czech group We Are Fair, said that 30 years after the end of communism, former eastern bloc countries still lagged behind their western European counterparts in granting fair and equal treatment to members of the LGBT community.\n\n\u201cThe iron curtain \u2026 still stands,\u201d Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1 said at the opening of the three-day ILGA conference in Prague. \u201cWhile life for them isn\u2019t perfect on either side of the [former] curtain, in none of the eastern European countries can they get married, in none of them can same-sex couples jointly adopt children.\u201d\n\nThat message will resonate with activists in Poland, where senior members of the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party (PiS) have engaged in an increasingly ferocious campaign portraying so-called \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d as a menace akin to that of Soviet-imposed communism. In the run-up to parliamentary elections this month, which PiS narrowly won, the \u201cLGBT issue\u201d emerged as one of the main campaign grounds.\n\nZbigniew Nosowski, the editor-in-chief of Wi\u0119\u017a, a relatively liberal Catholic quarterly in Warsaw, said the tactic was seen to have worked in May\u2019s European elections. \u201cThey provoked people who were usually passive in the elections to come to the polls and vote, because they perceived the threat from supposed LGBT and gender ideology with anxiety,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Pride parade in Lublin, eastern Poland, which was harassed by anti-LGBT disrupters.

They are a threat to Polish identity, to our nation, to its existence and thus to the Polish state.\u201d\n\nSince then, the rhetoric has only escalated. Kaczy\u0144ski insinuated that homosexual couples wanted the right to adopt children out of a desire for sexual gratification. The archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, Marek J\u0119draszewski, referred to the perceived threat from gay rights campaigners as a \u201crainbow plague\u201d, comparing it to Nazism and Soviet communism, in a sermon to mark the 75th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t call the people a plague, he called the ideology a plague,\u201d said archbishop Stanis\u0142aw G\u0105decki, the head of the Polish episcopate, in an interview in Warsaw in September, claiming it was akin to attacking communism while respecting individual people who were communists.\n\nIn Hungary, where the church is less powerful than in Poland, there is less deep-rooted homophobia. Budapest was one of the first cities in the region to have pride marches. But in recent months the ruling Fidesz party of the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has begun what appears to be a coordinated homophobic campaign.\n\nA Fidesz MP called for a boycott of Coca-Cola after the brand ran an advertising campaign featuring a gay couple, while the speaker of the Hungarian parliament, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 K\u00f6v\u00e9r, a close Orb\u00e1n ally, has made a series of homophobic comments. \u201cMorally, there is no difference between the behaviour of a paedophile and the behaviour of someone who demands such things,\u201d he said when talking about gay marriage and adoption.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People march from the parliament building in Budapest downtown during a LGBT Pride parade in July. Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe LGBT community could provide a useful new target for Orb\u00e1n after several years of relentless messaging about the dangers of migration from the Middle East and Africa.\n\n\u201cOne of the main basics of the politics of Fidesz is to provide a common enemy for the Hungarians,\u201d said \u00c1d\u00e1m Andr\u00e1s Kanics\u00e1r, a Hungarian journalist and LGBT activist. \u201cThese enemies were immigrants, then came Brussels and the EU, and then George Soros. But all of these enemies got boring for the audience, so they always have to find a new one. And the new ones are the LGBTQ people and rainbow families who are, according to Fidesz, dangerous to classical Catholic values and the Hungarian families.\u201d\n\nIn the Czech Republic, attitudes are even more progressive, with a recent survey showing 61% of people supported a bill currently under consideration that would legally enshrine gay marriage. But here too, conservative politicians are rallying part of their base with homophobic rhetoric disguised as a promotion of \u201ctraditional values\u201d.\n\nPartly as a result, the bill has become ensnared in the chamber of deputies, the Czech parliament\u2019s lower house, at the first reading stage. Attempts to give it a second reading have been repeatedly blocked, despite it having the public backing of Andrej Babi\u0161, the prime minister.\n\nCritics point out that Babi\u0161 has declined to use his authority to instruct MPs from his ANO party to vote for the bill and has sent out mixed signals by recently meeting with the rightwing group Movement for Life, which aims to increase birth rates and has been associated with homophobic stances.\n\nOpponents have tabled a counter-proposal to bring the Czech constitution into line with laws passed in Hungary and Slovakia that would explicitly define marriage as between a man and a woman. It is unlikely to pass but has received support from church figures and from Milo\u0161 Zeman, the populist Czech president, who has said he would veto any legislation legalising gay marriage.\n\n50 years after Stonewall: Yuval Noah Harari on the new threats to LGBT rights Read more\n\nAcross the region, the rhetoric has had an impact. A University of Warsaw study last year found more than two-thirds of people identifying as LGBTI in Poland had endured psychological or physical violence, and 70% of teenagers identifying as LGBTI had had suicidal thoughts. At a recent equality parade in the eastern Polish city of Bia\u0142ystok, far-right thugs physically assaulted participants after the event was publicly denounced by the local archbishop.\n\nThe increased homophobia has prompted solidarity and fightback among the LGBT community and more liberal-minded central Europeans. In Poland, a #jestemLGBT (I am LGBT) online campaign was launched on Twitter this year, with thousands of people celebrating their sexuality, coming out or simply showing their support.\n\nIn Hungary, parts of the LGBT community feel the new messaging requires a strong response. \u201cThe horrible homophobic communication somehow has woken up the community and made them realise that now they now have to fight for their rights,\u201d said Kanics\u00e1r.\n\nAdditional reporting by Flora Garamvolgyi", "description": "Politicians and church leaders are stirring homophobia to rally bases and stoke fear among voters", "authors": ["Shaun Walker", "Christian Davies", "Robert Tait"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96bf10310051b1e680792acda9192ad7f1a82035/0_0_5548_3329/master/5548.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=03c8ddd19ee7078123732163ec2e7c9e", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
