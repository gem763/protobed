They sought asylum by legally crossing the U.S. border at San Ysidro, in San Diego, an official U.S. port of entry.\n\nWhile his partner was granted asylum, for close to seven months Garcia Portillo has been in ICE custody under the jurisdiction of the New Orleans ICE Field Office \u2013 which is under court order to decide parole cases on an individual basis instead of instituting blanket rules. The rate of parole for the field office had dropped from more than 75% in 2016 to zero this year, according to a memorandum opinion from Washington, D.C. federal judge James Boasberg granting a preliminary injunction in a class action lawsuit filed by other asylum seekers.\n\nCourtesy Margaret Bobb\n\nOn Oct. 22, Garcia Portillo\u2019s request to be released on parole was denied because he was deemed a flight risk. His lawyer says ICE\u2019s decision to keep him detained has jeopardized Garcia Portillo\u2019s life and health.\n\n\"This [being part of the LGBTQ community] is the basis of his asylum claim, but it also makes him vulnerable in a prison where there aren\u2019t enough guards to keep the inmates from targeting each other,\" David Bennion, Garcia Portillo\u2019s lawyer, told ABC News. \"And Darwin has been targeted by other detainees who don\u2019t like being locked up with gay people. Darwin, and other LGBT detainees, they can\u2019t go to the bathroom by themselves; they have to take showers together to protect themselves, so they won\u2019t get beaten or raped.\"\n\nAccording to Bennion, there was no explanation of why Garcia Portillo was deemed to be a flight risk.\n\n\"He\u2019s been denied parole, with no justification,\" said Bennion. \"Clearly he\u2019s not a flight risk. He has a very strong network of support, which is where he\u2019ll go. He\u2019ll join his life partner, who already has asylum.\"\n\nCourtesy Margaret Bobb\n\nHernandez is currently living in Colorado with his sponsors, the Bobb family, who have also legally requested to become both Garcia Portillo and his younger brother\u2019s sponsors.\n\n\"We are not rich,\" Margaret Bobb, one of the sponsors, told ABC News. \"We\u2019re retired public school teachers. But we have extra bedrooms in our house because our children are grown. And we have like-minded friends who will jump in and help.\"\n\nGarcia Portillo\u2019s younger brother, who is a minor, is currently in the custody of United States Department of Health and Human Services. Garcia Portillo says he is the sole guardian for his younger brother, and according to Bennion, his little brother cannot be released until a guardian can claim him.\n\nBennion claims Garcia Portillo\u2019s little brother has tried to kill himself twice while in U.S. custody.\n\nABC News reached out to CBP, but they did not immediately respond with comment.\n\nAccording to ICE\u2019s own parole directive, if an asylum seeker passes his credible fear interview, proves his identity, demonstrates he is not a danger to society and shows he is not a flight risk, he should be released on parole while he waits for his asylum hearing.\n\nGarcia Portillo passed his credible fear test, has no criminal record, proved his identity and has the Bobb family willing to sponsor him, which is a strong indication that he is not a flight risk, according to his lawyer.\n\nDespite Judge Boasberg\u2019s ruling in the class action lawsuit, Garcia Portillo\u2019s lawyer said he believes not much has changed.\n\nCourtesy Margaret Bobb\n\n\"ICE doesn't believe it is bound by court decisions, and the federal courts don't seem interested in asserting their authority over ICE,\" Bennion said.\n\nGarcia Portillo\u2019s asylum hearing will take place over a video conference system on Nov. 7, according to Bennion. The judge will be located in Falls Church, Virginia, while Garcia Portillo and Bennion will be in Louisiana, and the court handling the case files will be in Minnesota.\n\n\"These agencies are in chaos,\" said Bennion. \"And it\u2019s politically motivated to make it more confusing for immigrants, so they can be more easily deported.\"\n\nAn ICE spokesperson said the agency \"cannot provide information\" on Garcia Portillo's request for parole. Regarding the class action lawsuit, ICE earlier said that it \u201cgenerally does not comment on pending litigation\u201d but complies \u201cwith court orders.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Bobb family, along with advocates, will be holding a press conference outside of Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet\u2019s office in Colorado, hoping to call attention to Garcia Portillo\u2019s case.\n\nGarcia Portillo\u2019s lawyer is concerned that since he has been detained for the last seven months, he hasn\u2019t been able to properly gather evidence to make the best possible claim.\n\n\"It\u2019s just difficult when your client is locked up 1,500 miles away,\" said Bennion, who is based out of Philadelphia and taking the case pro bono. \"It's a big risk. And we can\u2019t trust that due process will be protected in this system.\"", "description": "Darwin Celinn Garcia Portillo has been in ICE custody for nearly seven months.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/san-ysidro-ice-mo_hpMain_20191029-204033_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
