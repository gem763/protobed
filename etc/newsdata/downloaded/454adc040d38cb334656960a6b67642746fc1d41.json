(AP) - Drug-ravaged West Virginia has opened its first family treatment court aimed at protecting abused and neglected children while helping parents facing the potential loss of custody to overcome substance use disorders.\n\nThe court\u2019s debut at the Boone County Courthouse in Madison was celebrated Monday. Family treatment courts also will open in Ohio and Randolph counties.\n\nBoone County Circuit Judge William Thompson is heavily involved in helping people addicted to drugs turn their lives around. He runs a court for both adult and juvenile drug offenders and envisioned the idea of a family treatment court a decade ago.\n\nThompson said the new court\u2019s goal is keeping families together. He said similar programs in Ithaca in upstate New York and in Orange County, North Carolina, were studied to see how family treatment courts work in rural areas.\n\nThompson said the court will intervene after an abuse and neglect petition has been filed involving drug-addicted parents who have not yet lost permanent custody.\n\nDrug cases have overwhelmed West Virginia\u2019s court system. In a state of 1.8 million residents, more than 30,000 people are in drug treatment in West Virginia, which has by far the nation\u2019s highest drug overdose death rate.\n\nAs the state grapples with the addiction epidemic, the number of children under state foster care has swelled to about 6,900, up more than 60% from 2015.\n\nState Supreme Court Chief Justice Beth Walker said nearly one-third of the appeals heard by the court involve child abuse and neglect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pervasive issue,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe know that there are more children in foster care. It\u2019s a reality. It\u2019s part of the addiction crisis. But everything that we can do to maybe change that outcome, to maybe find a way for those kids to return to their parents, that\u2019s what the family treatment courts are all about.\u201d\n\nThe Legislature approved the new court in March. Participation by families is voluntary.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to mandate, encourage, twist their arm, whatever it might be, to get them to participate in recovery,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cBecause most people don\u2019t wake up each morning wanting to be a drug addict. Most people don\u2019t want to wake up each morning giving up their kids. But we have to give them the tools.\u201d\n\nThose tools might include counseling in areas such as mental health, substance abuse recovery groups, parenting, finances and career-related support.\n\nNot every instance will have a happy ending.\n\n\u201cI hope that every case that comes through here is going to work,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI know that\u2019s not going to be the case. I know there are going to be people who fail. There\u2019s people who fail in adult drug court and there are people who fail in juvenile drug court. I learned from the failures. But we\u2019re going to celebrate the successes.\n\n\u201cRight now our ratio of actually fixing families is very poor. (But) every time we fix a family, that\u2019s another child that doesn\u2019t lose their mom and dad. That\u2019s another child that\u2019s going to grow up in a home where somebody will actually be able to take care of them as opposed to being placed in the foster care system.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Drug-ravaged West Virginia has opened its first family treatment court aimed at protecting abused and neglected children while helping parents facing the potential loss of custody to overcome substance use disorders.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Raby", "John Ra"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/opioid_crisis-family_treatment_court_36193_c0-337-4032-2687_s1770x1032.jpg?9cd94d46bb0cc65df02073427140e6253a9a327b", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
