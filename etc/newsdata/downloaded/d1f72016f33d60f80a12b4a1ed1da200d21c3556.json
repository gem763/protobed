If neither option is given, click More Settings.\n\nDepending on your phone model, operating system and cellular provider, you will notice one of the following: Read Receipts, Send Read Receipts or Request Receipt.

When you finish reading your messages, force quit the Messenger app.\n\nA second option is the Facebook Chat Privacy extension. Add to the Chrome browser, and all \"seen\" and \"is typing\" notices will be blocked.\n\nWhatsApp lets you choose\n\nSince Facebook owns WhatsApp, it's understandable the application also has built-in read receipts.\n\nUnlike its parent company, you have the opportunity to opt-out of read receipts within the app.\n\nRELATED: Sometimes we all need to get back to the basics.
