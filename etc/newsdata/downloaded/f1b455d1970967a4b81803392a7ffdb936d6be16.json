In July last year, the stock sold for more than \u00a32 a share.\n\nThe company insisted that the rate of decline at its physical stores has 'reduced in recent weeks' but added that it will consider some store closures as and when leases come up for renewal.\n\nIt follows the launch of a business review earlier this year, aimed at cutting costs and turning the company's fortunes around.\n\nQuiz boss Tarak Ramzan said: 'Overall, the group's trading performance in the first half has been broadly in line with the board's expectations despite the difficult UK trading environment.'\n\nHe added: 'Whilst trading conditions are expected to remain challenging in the near term, the board remains confident that underpinned by Quiz's flexible business model and an increasing online focus, the group can return to sustainable profitable growth in the medium term.'\n\nQuiz said the rate of decline at its physical stores has 'reduced in recent weeks'\n\nIt has been a torrid year for Quiz. Its shares have collapsed by more than 90 per cent to lows of just 13p in August amid a string of disappointing results and profit warnings.\n\nThe company, which floated on the London stock exchange in 2017, previously bemoaned a significant slowdown in shopper numbers as difficult trading conditions 'persisted'.\n\nAt its full-year results in June, Quiz admitted that its profits had shrunk to almost nothing.\n\nA 97 per cent slide left it with earnings of just \u00a30.2million - down from \u00a38.5million a year earlier.\n\nArlene Ewing, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: 'Investors will have a keen eye on the results of the root and branch review announced earlier in the year, particularly the company's plans for some of its units in costly shopping centres.\n\n'There is, nevertheless, some significant work required to turn the tide at Quiz, making it self-sufficient and able to handle the shocks faced by the wider sector.'", "description": "The embattled company, a former Only Way is Essex favourite, said the performance at its shops and concessions was weaker-than-hoped amid 'very challenging' high street conditions.", "authors": ["Emily Hardy For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
