Yes, the Democratic candidate and comic genius is a massive fan of the show starring Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson as a former NFL star-turned-financial manager whose gargantuan muscles are always straining to burst free from the confines of his suit. We've known this for a while now. She also just loves the Rock himself, period. And, sure, the Rock is an intensely lovable guy\u2014weird movie taste and even weirder oatmeal taste aside\u2014but Warren apparently appreciates the guy so much that she'd \"welcome\" his run for president.\n\nEntertainment Weekly caught up with Warren in the midst of her busy campaign schedule to chat about, yes, the series finale of Ballers, and the conversation naturally turned to the Rock's on-going flirtation with a presidential bid. Warren, it seems, is down.\n\nPer EW:\n\nThe Rock has thrown out the possibility that he could eventually run for president. How would you like your chances against him? Obviously, you\u2019re such a huge fan, so might it be tough to go head-to-head with your Spencer Strasmore?\n\n[Laughs] I would welcome him to the race. I know he would fight for the principles that he believes in\u2014he\u2019s my kind of guy!\n\nHis likability scores would be off the charts.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t like The Rock? And I have to say, who doesn\u2019t love The Rock\u2019s wardrobe choices\u2014don\u2019t they just knock you out? Those vests and the pink shirts\u2026Oh man, it is eye candy.\n\nThe Rock, of course, has been teasing a presidential run for years. He talked about it with all the way back in 2016, then again in a 2017 GQ cover story, and there's even an official committee to elect him called Run the Rock 2020.\n\nThe guy has made it pretty clear that he won't be giving the people's elbow to our nation's flailing economy or whatever anytime soon, since there are \"a lot of other things [he wants] to do first.\" But if and when the guy ever decides to run, it sounds like he has Elizabeth Warren's blessing\u2014if he wears that pink shirt and vest combo, at least.", "description": "\"I know he would fight for the principles that he believes in.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da26e1e663430000a949b1b/lede/1570977689171-48590092987_5056c8e167_k-copy.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.9998585972850679xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
