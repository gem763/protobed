REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nMSCI\u2019s world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.2%, with the broad Euro STOXX 600 adding 0.3%.\n\nThe positive mood mirrored gains for Asian stocks. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.3%, with Chinese shares .CSI300 gaining 0.3%.\n\nAppetite for riskier assets was also supported as markets judged the chances of a disruptive \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit as lowering, even after Britain\u2019s parliament delayed a vote on Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s deal to exit the EU.\n\nJohnson will seek to put his Brexit deal to a vote on Monday, with the government proposing a debate on the agreement. Parliament was due to open at 1330 GMT.\n\nIt was unclear, though, whether parliament\u2019s speaker would allow a vote to go ahead.\n\nEarlier in Asia, investors were boosted by Chinese vice premier Liu He\u2019s comments on Friday that Beijing will collaborate with the United States to address mutual concerns on the trade war.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump had on Friday also struck an optimistic tone, saying he thought a trade deal would be signed before an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Chile next month.\n\n\u201cThey seem to making progress,\u201d said Jeremy Gatto, an investment manager at Unigestion in Geneva. \u201cBut we have seen in past that everything seems to look great and then a couple of days later seems to deteriorate again.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 U.S. presidential election was also influencing the talks, investors said, with Trump looking to avoid the possibility of tariffs imposed by China impacting his voting base.\n\n\u201cTrump realises that some of the tariffs that potentially could be implemented towards the end of the year could affect the consumer, which would be bad for the U.S. economy - and obviously bad for him,\u201d Gatto said.\n\nWall Street futures NQcv1EScv1 were looking positive, too, indicating slim gains of around 0.3%.\n\nMarkets were also gearing up for high-profile earnings reports this week from firms including Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O).\n\nPOUND TOUCHES 5-1/2 MONTH PEAK\n\nBy 0845 GMT, the pound GBP=D3 had surged to $1.301, recovering earlier losses of half a percent against the dollar.\n\nSterling had by Friday risen by up to 6.5% in seven trading days to a five-month high, underscoring market expectations that either a deal or delay was most likely.\n\nGoldman Sachs said it now sees the chance of a no-deal Brexit reduced to 5%, from 10% previously.\n\nStill, some investors said that sterling\u2019s medium-term prospects were limited, even if no deal is avoided.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too bullish because there is still going to be a huge amount of uncertainty going forward, even if the current deal is agreed,\u201d said Tim Drayson, head of economics at Legal & General Investment Management.\n\n\u201cIf this deal does go through, ultimately it is still a relatively hard Brexit - we are out of the customs union - and it is still a deterioration in the UK terms of trade.\u201d\n\nThe dollar against a basket of six major currencies .DXY was flat.\n\nBond markets also reacted to Brexit developments, with euro zone bond yields rising on the receding risk of a British no-deal exit.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year German government bond yield rose 5 basis points to -0.34% DE10YT=RR, while other core euro zone yields were also higher FR10YT=RR.\n\nIn commodities, oil prices largely held steady on Monday, recouping some early losses as investors took stock of global economic pressures that could impact oil demand.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were down 12 cents to $59.35 a barrel by 0815 GMT.", "description": "World shares nudged higher on Monday, as hopes for progress towards resolving the U.S.-China trade war and a belief that Britain will avoid a disorderly exit from the European Union gave cause for riskier bets.", "authors": ["Tom Wilson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443291062&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0KI", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
