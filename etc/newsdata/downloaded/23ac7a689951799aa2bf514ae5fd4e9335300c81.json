Though 1 million have applied for settled status, at least 2.6 million have yet do so.\n\nMore than 100 EU citizens who have yet to apply contacted the Guardian on Tuesday to express fears about what their status would be immediately after a no-deal Brexit.\n\nOne person is a solicitor who moved from Sweden at the age of three in the 1980s, who has not yet applied for settled status because she does not have an Android phone. The application cannot yet be done on an iPhone, although the Home Office said this will be possible in the autumn, but can be done by post or by going to a dedicated scanning centre, although this takes longer.\n\nWe would like to hear about any issues you have encountered applying for settled status in the UK.\n\nHow to get in touch\n\nWhat issues have you encountered when applying? Have you experienced loading or queuing problems when filling in the application online? What has your experience been like using the EU exit: ID document check app? Alternatively, did you find applying easy? We would also like to hear from you if you have been denied settled status or if you have been in the UK for longer than five years and were given pre-settled status.\n\nYou can share your views in the encrypted form below \u2013 anonymously if you wish. Only the Guardian will see your responses. One of our journalists will contact you before we publish your story.\n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble using the form, click here.
