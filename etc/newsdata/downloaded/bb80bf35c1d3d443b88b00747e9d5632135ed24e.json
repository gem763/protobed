Will it at all?\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an issue that could be addressed on-air while the show was still dark. But with its return this weekend for the first episode of Season 45, it will be interesting to see whether \u201cS.N.L.\u201d will acknowledge its lapse in judgment in hiring a comedian who was known in the comedy world for racist, sexist and homophobic humor, which stirred up plenty of criticism.\n\nThere are a number of ways the show might attempt to make amends \u2014 over the last 44 years, it has had occasion to try most of them. While we wait to see what happens on Saturday night, here\u2019s a look back at how \u201cS.N.L.\u201d has handled past flaps. (Note: We\u2019re focusing on responses that happened within the show itself, so won\u2019t get into things like Mike Myers\u2019s apology to the Clintons over a tasteless \u201cWayne\u2019s World\u201d joke about Chelsea.)\n\nThe Claudine Longet Invitational\n\nThe French pop singer and actress Claudine Longet was arrested in 1976 for shooting and killing her lover, the pro skier Vladimir \u201cSpider\u201d Sabich . Longet claimed the shooting was an accident, which \u201cS.N.L.\u201d spoofed near the end of its first season.", "description": "Will \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d address the Shane Gillis flap in its Season 45 premiere this weekend?
