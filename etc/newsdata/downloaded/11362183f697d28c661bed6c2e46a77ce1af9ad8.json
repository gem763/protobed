USA TODAY\n\nWeek 7 of the college football season gave us what we were waiting for.\n\nOklahoma showed it is the strength of the Big 12 Conference. Texas didn\u2019t do anything to warrant thinking the Longhorns are anything other than a strong No. 2, and yes, Baylor is for real \u2014 although the officials may have had something to do with the Bears\u2019 latest escape by three points over Texas Tech.\n\nThrow in Iowa State, which after almost two months finally looks to have found a bonafide rushing threat not named Brock Purdy, and you\u2019ve got a clear picture of the conference\u2019s top four teams.\n\nNo. 1 Oklahoma (6-0, 3-0 Big 12)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 1\n\nLast weekend: Defeated No. 11 Texas 34-27.\n\nIn a nutshell: Breaking News \u2014 Oklahoma is playing solid defense, too. Allowing just 27 points in what\u2019s usually a high-scoring Red River Showdown shows that finally, the Sooners can play a bit on that side of the ball. They had to, because quarterback Jalen Hurts wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 with a fumble and a red-zone interception. He\u2019s still in serious Heisman Trophy contention.\n\nOn deck: Saturday vs. West Virginia at noon, Fox.\n\nOklahoma quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) wears the Golden Hat trophy after the Sooners defeated Texas at the Cotton Bowl. (Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNo. 2 Texas (4-2, 2-1)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 2\n\nLast weekend: Lost to Oklahoma 34-27.\n\nIn a nutshell: This is a very good program that\u2019s still a way from being elite. Get an offensive line that doesn\u2019t give up nine sacks \u2013 like it did against Oklahoma on Saturday. Get an offensive line that can keep defenders at least out of the backfield and somewhat away from quarterback Sam Ehlinger ... that\u2019s when this program becomes elite.\n\nOn deck: Saturday vs. Kansas, 7 p.m., Longhorn Network.\n\nNo. 3 Baylor (6-0, 3-0)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 3\n\nLast weekend: Defeated Texas Tech 33-30 in two overtimes.\n\nIn a nutshell: Living on the edge is one thing \u2014 like the Bears have done recently against Texas Tech and Iowa State \u2014 but doing it going forward without one of its star players could be tough. Linebacker Clay Johnston is likely to miss the remainder of the season because of a knee injury suffered in the double-overtime win against the Red Raiders. He was the team leader in tackles for a team that\u2019s been playing solid defense.\n\nOn deck: Saturday at Oklahoma State, 4 p.m., Fox.\n\nNo. 4 Iowa State (4-2, 2-1)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 4\n\nLast weekend: Defeated West Virginia 38-14.\n\nIn a nutshell: Breaking News II: The Cyclones have found a running back. True freshman Breece Hall answered the call with 132 rushing yards and three touchdowns on 26 carries Saturday. The only thing holding him back from being No. 1 earlier, was inconsistent practices. He\u2019s clearly on top of the depth chart moving forward.\n\nOn deck: Saturday at Texas Tech, noon, FS1.\n\nNo. 5 TCU (3-2, 1-1)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 8\n\nLast weekend: Idle.\n\nIn a nutshell: An off-week was exactly what TCU needed. True freshman quarterback Max Duggan needed a Saturday in which to catch his breath, after his whirlwind first year out of a Council Bluffs, Iowa high school. Big test this week comes in Manhattan.\n\nOn deck: Saturday at Kansas State, 2:30 p.m., FSN.\n\nNo. 6 Oklahoma State (4-2, 1-2)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 6\n\nLast weekend: Idle.\n\nIn a nutshell: Now it gets tough for an Oklahoma State team that\u2019s lost two of its last three games. The Cowboys are at home against Baylor on Saturday, followed by at Iowa State, and then back home for TCU.\n\nOn deck: Saturday vs. No. 18 Baylor, 4 p.m., Fox\n\nNo. 7 Texas Tech (3-3, 1-2)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 5\n\nLast weekend: Lost to Baylor 33-30 in two overtimes.\n\nIn a nutshell: How close did Texas Tech come to upsetting a second ranked opponent in a row? Very, considering in incorrect ref\u2019s decision during the first overtime erased a Red Raiders fumble recovery in the double-overtime loss. On the first OT\u2019s second play, Tech\u2019s Jaylon Hutchings recovered a faulty snap, however the refs ruled it to be an illegal snap, and penalized the Bears five yards. Naturally, they went on to score during the controversial possession.\n\nOn deck: Saturday vs. Iowa State, noon, FS1.\n\nNo. 8 Kansas State (3-2, 0-2)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 9\n\nLast weekend: Idle.\n\nIn a nutshell: Coach Chris Klieman\u2019s team has lost two Big 12 games in a row after going 3-0 in the non-conference season. With Oklahoma and Texas still to play, time could be running out in reaching the six-win bowl game plateau.\n\nOn deck: Saturday vs. TCU, 2:30 p.m., FSN.\n\nNo. 9 West Virginia (3-3, 1-2)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 7\n\nLast weekend: Lost to Iowa State 38-14.\n\nIn a nutshell: The Mountaineers are a 33-point underdog at Oklahoma Saturday for a game in which they could be without a healthy quarterback Austin Kendall, and in which starting cornerback Hakeem Bailey is suspended for the first half after being flagged for targeting against Iowa State\n\nOn deck: Saturday at No. 5 Oklahoma, noon, Fox.\n\nNo. 10 Kansas (2-4, 0-3)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 10\n\nLast weekend: Idle.\n\nIn a nutshell: The off-week was good for the offensively-poor team to adjust to the recent hiring of new coordinator Brent Dearmon. His mission is to pump life into unit that\u2019s averaging just 354.5 yards. That\u2019s 103rd nationally, yet still ahead of West Virginia in the Big 12.\n\nOn deck: Saturday at Texas at 7 p.m., Longhorn Network.", "description": "After Week 7, the picture of who are the contenders in the Big 12 is clear.
