The petition was virtually rendered infructuous when Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, arguably the most effective and forceful lawyer the NDA government has had on its rolls since coming to power in 2014, announced that 98% of the trees that needed to be out of the way are gone. All that remained for SC to do was to stay further tree-felling and order status quo.\n\nJustice Arun Mishra will muse over the irony. In Kerala he has ordered the demolition of four apartment complexes for violating Coastel Regulatory Zone norms. Here he came into the picture too late to stop the felling of trees. Even the status quo ordered by the court is in debate: does it cover only tree felling or does it extend to clearing the stumps of felled trees. The government thinks it doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s the extent to which it has triumphed in the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation with activists who opposed the felling of trees. The two day breather it got after Bombay HC lifted the stay order and the activists approached SC was all it took for government to exercise its executive authority.\n\nOne can understand that government has to balance development and environment imperatives. One can picture government mandarins tout all the green measures they take to preserve the environment like switching from single use plastics, placing pollution curbs, planting saplings, banning groundwater exploitation, etc. But it is remarkable how a forest is always the loser despite all the green measures. Mining projects invariably are located in forested areas, a railway line or highway will invariably run into a forest reserve somewhere, a hydel project has to be located deep inside a forest in hilly terrain because this is where rivers originate and gather volume and momentum.\n\nOnce deforested, it either takes a forest years to regenerate and in most cases, never. Court has rightly ordered the release of activists who were arrested for protesting at Aarey Colony. Their release proves that it is your right to non-violently oppose the government of the day for a cause you hold dear. The forest, however, couldn\u2019t protest. But let us-governments and citizens-not treat that silence with contempt: nature\u2019s response could be a flood, a drought, or a heat wave.", "description": "One can imagine the predicament of the Supreme Court bench that was urgently constituted to hear the review petition against the Bombay high court order lifting the stay on felling of trees at the Aarey...", "authors": ["Jij Kattakayam"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/aarey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
