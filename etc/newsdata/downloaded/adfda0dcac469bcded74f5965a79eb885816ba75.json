The cosmonaut who made history by exiting his capsule for 12 minutes almost 54 years ago will be laid to rest next Tuesday at a federal military cemetery.\n\nA Siberian native, he was one of the 20 Soviet Air Force pilots carefully selected to become part of the first cosmonaut group in 1960 where he made friends with Yuri Gagarin.\n\nThe 1965 mission, dubbed Voskhod 2 (or Dawn 2 in English) came amid the contentious space race between the USSR and the United States. Despite an array of glitches \u2013 from Leonov having troubles to re-enter the airlock, to his capsule missing the landing zone \u2013 the historic flight was considered a success.\n\nInterestingly, Leonov was initially slated to become the first man to land on the Moon, but the costly project was cancelled when the US Apollo crew touched down on the Earth\u2019s satellite in 1969, leaving the Soviets behind.\n\nStill, he pioneered another space endeavor six years later, commanding the Soviet crew during the 1975 Soyuz-Apollo experimental mission, in which the American module was docked to the Soviet one thus forming a temporary space station.\n\nProminent public figures in Russia commented on Leonov\u2019s passing later in the day, expressing sadness and sympathy for his family. \u201cThis is an immeasurable loss,\u201d said cosmonaut Maxim Suraev, who said he was \u201ca living legend.\u201d\n\nRT\u2019s \u201cEarth 360\u02da\u201d documentary featured Leonov and NASA astronaut Thomas Stafford, commander of the second manned mission to orbit the moon. In the film, the pair, who made history when they shook hands after the successful Apollo-Soyuz docking in 1975, compare their first-hand spaceflight experiences to RT\u2019s SPACEWALK 360, the first-ever panoramic video filmed in open space.\n\nAlso on rt.com 1st ever spacewalk relived by Russian cosmonaut in epic 360 VR (VIDEO)\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
