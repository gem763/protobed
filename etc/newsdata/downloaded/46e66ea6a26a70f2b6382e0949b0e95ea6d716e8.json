There is not point having a meaningless vote, the government would pull the motion,\u201d the spokesman told reporters.\n\n\u201cThe public want Brexit done. The government is determined to pass the PM\u2019s great new deal and get us out of the EU on Oct. 31 ... The deal with the EU has just been agreed, it is done, it is closed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe negotiations with the EU have already gone on far too long. The prime minister has achieved what is a very good deal and he is focused on getting that deal through parliament.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman said the government would introduce the legislation required for Britain\u2019s departure to parliament on Tuesday, the start of a process when lawmakers can again try to force fundamental changes to the deal, including remaining in the EU\u2019s customs union or for a second referendum.\n\nThe government has ruled out both of those options.\n\n\u201cIf essentially the legislation in the House of Commons steps too far away from what was agreed in the Withdrawal Agreement and the political declaration, that does bring into question ratification,\u201d the spokesman said.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants his Brexit deal to be passed by parliament, his spokesman said on Monday, warning lawmakers the government would not hold a vote on the agreement if lawmakers tried to change it.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
