Additional tit-for-tat tariff hikes are scheduled to take effect Oct. 1 and Dec. 15. Many U.S. companies have warned that they will need to pass on the costs of the tariffs to consumers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters Sunday (link)that \"We can't allow China to rip us off anymore as a country,\" but said trade negotiations with China were still set to resume this month.\n\nEarlier this weekend, the official gauge of China's factory activity showed sluggish output for a fourth straight month. The manufacturing purchasing managers index edged down to 49.5 in August from 49.7 in July, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics, lower than economists' median forecast of 49.6, the Wall Street Journal reported (link). Readings below 50 indicate a contraction in factory activity.\n\nJapan's Nikkei slipped 0.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index retreated 0.4%, as continued pro-democracy protests disrupted airport traffic (link).
