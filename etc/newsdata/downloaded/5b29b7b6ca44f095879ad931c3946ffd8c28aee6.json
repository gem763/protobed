Sure, it\u2019s a cover-based shooter and a guns-and-ammo fantasy about post-disaster America. But it\u2019s also a game about stats and figuring out how to tweak them, improve them, and ensure that your character\u2019s numbers are better than your enemy\u2019s. It may sound as exciting as a new function being added to a spreadsheet program, but the sweeping changes make a world of difference and improve the gameplay.\n\nAs part of Title Update 6, three changes were added to The Division 2 for free earlier this month alongside new missions that slightly advance the game\u2019s story. First, there\u2019s a new thing called loot targeting that adds an alternate version of the game\u2019s world map displaying where different types of guns and gear are most likely to drop from enemies and missions on a given day.\n\nSecond, there\u2019s been an expansion to the game\u2019s brand sets, ensuring that there are a full six pieces of tactical gear\u2014knee pads, breathing masks, backpacks and so on\u2014for nearly all of the in-game gear manufacturers.\n\nFinally, a change was made to the game\u2019s gear recalibration system that lets players swap attributes of different colours. Huge change, right? Put that one in the TV commercials.\n\nThe Division 2 was warmly received on release, boasting a remarkable bounty of enjoyable activities across its detailed rendition of Washington, DC, following a biological weapons attack on the United States. The successful launch was followed by several controversies, however, including the launch of an eight-player raid that lacked a promised matchmaking option. The most severe criticism involved the very thing that this new trio of updates addresses: an overall problem with the game\u2019s loot, whereby getting great loot was tedious and frustrating and too few of the pieces of loot in the game even seemed worth getting.\n\nThis last problem was arguably the thing most holding The Division 2 back. In theory, if you\u2019ve got a game with tons of stats and loot, you should have a game that supports a lot of player choice, and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ve just got clutter. The loot needs to be varied, meaningful, and useful in many configurations. For those who made it to the persistent challenges and skirmishes of The Division 2\u2019s endgame, the loot was failing that test. Players were all chasing the same gear for a narrow set of optimised builds and weren\u2019t having much fun\u2014let alone experiencing much gameplay variety\u2014during that chase.\n\nHere\u2019s how the changes turned that big problem around.\n\nTargeted Loot Map\n\nThis makes the hunt for loot more comprehensible and more varied. Every day, the map updates, showing new locations where players can farm for a specific type of weapon or gear from a specific in-game manufacturer.\n\nThe new loot-targeting map showing where different types of guns and gear were most likely to drop on Sunday October 27. The distribution changes daily.\n\nOn Sunday, for example, players who were looking for better rifles could find the greatest abundance of them by completing tasks and fighting roaming enemies on the East Mall between the Washington Monument and the Capitol. If the player was more interested in farming for gear made by Alps Summit Armament, that was going to drop more heavily throughout the game\u2019s ViewPoint Museum mission, set in a fictional version of DC\u2019s Newseum.\n\nOn Tuesday, those locations all changed. Rifles are now dropping more heavily in the Federal Triangle area. Alps Summit Armament gear is most likely to drop in the District Union Arena mission, a fight set in a basketball arena.\n\nThere was nothing like this in the game prior to Title Update 6. You couldn\u2019t predict where shotguns were most likely to drop from enemies or where you could most likely gather gear from a specific brand. On top of showing that, the daily rotation of where things are most likely to drop encourages players who are hunting for a specific kind of loot to try different in-game activities every day. Maybe today\u2019s loot targeting nudges a player toward replaying the game\u2019s enjoyable DC zoo mission or gives them motivation to just roam the area near the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nBrand Set Expansion\n\nThe update to the game\u2019s gear provides more options for players seeking brand perks. Every time a player equips gear from a certain brand, their character gains a perk tied to that brand, for a maximum of three brand-related perks. Before the update, some of the game\u2019s gear manufacturers didn\u2019t make gear for every equippable slot. Some were missing a chest piece, or a backpack, or gloves and so on. This meant that you could easily wear three pieces from one brand, but if you wanted to simultaneously wear three pieces from another, it might not be possible.\n\nWith Title Update 6, each brand offers full gear sets, so now it\u2019s easier for players to wear three pieces of gear from one manufacturer for perks and three from another and get all of its benefits. That\u2019s six perks overall, and if you\u2019re a player who uses, say, a hive gadget and a drone gadget as your two equippable gadgets, being able to wear three pieces each from the Alps and Wyvern gets you really good perks for both. This is why knowing where a gear manufacturer\u2019s stuff is most likely to drop in the game via loot targeting is so appealing.\n\nAttribute Swapping\n\nBut it\u2019s the game\u2019s change to gear recalibration that really makes this all click and makes playing The Division 2 long-term so satisfying. It comes down to the ability to swap a piece of gear\u2019s attributes\u2014that\u2019s a technical term\u2014with others regardless of the colour-coding of said attributes. Gloves, backpacks and the like all have attributes. Defence-buffing armour and health attributes are colour-coded blue. Offensive weapon perks are red. Attributes that enhance gadget skills are yellow. Being able to swap them freely is a huge deal.\n\nPreviously, if a player went to the game\u2019s recalibration bench to tweak, say, a\u201cSashimono\u201d backpack, they\u2019d be able to spend some in-game resources on replacing a blue attribute with another blue one from a different backpack in their inventory, a red with a red. Do you like the backpack for your character but don\u2019t love that 12,000-point armour boost? At the recalibration bench, you can replace it with another backpack\u2019s superior 15,875-point armour boost. Even better: Since Title Update 6, players can now replace that blue-coded armour boost with a yellow-coded boost to gadget skill power or a red-coded boost to critical hit chance or any other attribute from any other owned backpack, regardless of colour.\n\nThis dramatically deepens the extent to which players can customise their gear. A player may be running a character who they want to specialise in gun damage, for example, and thanks to Title Update 6, they can ditch yellow gadget attributes or blue defensive ones and load up on red-coded weapon boosts. This has made all gear more useful because it\u2019s now far easier to make viable combinations of different gear.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. That aforementioned Sashimono backpack doesn\u2019t just have brand perks and colour-coded attributes. It also has a \u201ctalent,\u201d perhaps the Tech Support talent which causes kills from explosives or gadgets to make subsequent gadget-based offence more potent for several seconds. There\u2019s just one catch. The Tech Support talent, like many gear talents, can only be activated if the player has the right amount of colour-coded attributes across all of their gear. Reread that sentence if you need to. In this case, the Sashimono Backpack\u2019s talent only works if a player has six or more yellow attributes spread across their six pieces of gear.\n\nThanks to the new update, players can far more easily hit whatever threshold they need to activate a given talent. The talent you want to activate might require you have at least seven yellows or fewer than four reds and so on. Being able to change colour-coded attributes means being able to easily change the number of reds, blues, and yellows without having to ditch a piece of gear entirely. Again, the result is deeper customisation for players, allowing for a lot more tinkering and ultimately more options for players to create effective, distinct character builds.\n\nThe Division 2 isn\u2019t fully clear of its thicket of problems. From a gameplay perspective, it lacks many compelling repeatable modes along the lines of the randomised Underground mode of the first Division or of, say, Gambit in Destiny 2. Two major episode content updates have added story missions but haven\u2019t substantially expanded the game\u2019s map. It only has one raid, and its second was delayed until 2020. The dense game world is not exactly lacking in missions and activities, though, and thanks to these improvements, all of what you can do in the game is now more rewarding. Playing the game feels better.\n\nIt\u2019s a little frustrating that Ubisoft probably won\u2019t build anything more atop Title Update 6 until next year, but it firms up the foundation. There\u2019s a promising framework for what comes next.", "description": "The Division 2 is, among other things, a maths problem.
