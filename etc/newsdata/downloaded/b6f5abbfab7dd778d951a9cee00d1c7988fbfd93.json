He writes in the letter that he does not want to provide commentary on the truthfulness of comments made by Radebe.\n\nFired? No, resigned\n\nIn mid-March, Radebe, in a statement, said he had fired Makasi.\n\nRadebe said at the time that after \"serious allegations\" were brought to his attention he first discussed them with Makasi and then asked for a written response. After considering the response, he said he fired the former CEF chair on March 15. Radebe did not at the time say what the serious allegations involved.\n\nDA spokesperson on energy, Kevin Mileham, said in March that the opposition party intended to lay charges with police in connection with the case. In his original statement, Mileham alleged that Makasi had resigned shortly before he was set to be fired.\n\nRadebe was replaced by Mantashe as minister of energy when Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the departments of mineral resources and energy would be merged.\n\n", "description": "This contradicts a previous statement by ex-minister Jeff Radebe, who said he fired the fund's former chair in mid-March.", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2639/4afd579cfe7e4fff8172fbf28d47ac4b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
