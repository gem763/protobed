Weiss is wavering", "language": "en", "text": "AD\n\nAD\n\nThings don\u2019t seem to be going well for the pair, though \u2014 at least not as well as logic would dictate they should. Each new headline about them feels increasingly negative. To say they\u2019ve experienced a fall from grace would be a tremendous overstatement, but it\u2019s safe to say that it\u2019s (kind of) tough out there for a former GoT showrunner.\n\nThe latest news about the two came Monday night, when Deadline broke the story that the pair had \u201cwalked away from their much-publicized deal with Disney\u2019s Lucasfilm to launch a feature film trilogy in 2022.\u201d\n\nTheir first major post-GoT project was supposed to be launching the next series of Star Wars movies. The move made sense, given how they (generally) excelled at adapting Martin\u2019s books. Both Star Wars and GoT are entire universes unto themselves, with myriad characters and a deep, self-contained mythology.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the two said they don\u2019t have time for the project, thanks to a nine-figure deal they signed with Netflix \u2014 though the streaming service is keeping any further details of the deal under wraps. (Like we said, it\u2019s not all bad news.)\n\n\u201cThere are only so many hours in the day, and we felt we could not do justice to both \u2018Star Wars\u2019 and our Netflix projects. So we are regretfully stepping away,\u201d the duo told Deadline in a statement. \u201cWe love \u2018Star Wars.\u2019 When George Lucas built it, he built us too. Getting to talk about \u2018Star Wars\u2019 with him and the current \u2018Star Wars\u2019 team was the thrill of a lifetime, and we will always be indebted to the saga that changed everything.\u201d\n\nThe news came just days after comments they made at the Austin Film Festival went semi-viral, and not in a way that would make their PR reps happy. Essentially, they reportedly said that they learned how to create a television show while \u2026 creating a massive television show.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey acknowledge that they have no idea why after such a dismal ['Game of Thrones\u2019] pilot why they went forward. \u2018Everything we could make a mistake in, we did.\u2019 Script, casting, costume. They think HBO went forward bc they had a lot of foreign presales on the series,\u201d tweeted a writer who attended the panel. \u201cDan is saying that #GameofThrones was basically an expensive film school for he and Dave. For example, they had no idea how to work with costume designers, and it was a huge learning experience.\"\n\nGiven that the quotes came from one Twitter account and were later disseminated on blogs, they should be taken with a grain of salt. But the response to the revelations was telling. Accusations that Benioff and Weiss have primarily relied on \u201cprivilege\u201d during their careers poured forth. One user referred to their comments as \u201cbasically White Male Privilege 101.\u201d\n\nThe two news items are almost positively unrelated, but many on social media seemed to link the events.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat a week it\u2019s been for Benioff and Weiss,\u201d tweeted Kevin Clancy, a Barstool Sports radio host. \u201cThey flat out admitted they didn\u2019t know what they were doing on Thrones and then they lost \u2018Star Wars.\u2019 I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s not a good idea to admit you don\u2019t know how to do a fantasy epic when you\u2019ve signed on to do \u2018Star Wars.'\u201d\n\nPublic perception of the two creatives began souring in 2017 when they announced plans to create \u201cConfederate,\u201d a drama for HBO imagining a world where the South didn\u2019t lose the Civil War. The hashtag #NoConfederate quickly began trending, reaching the No. 1 Twitter topic stateside and No. 2 worldwide. Culture critic Roxane Gay, writing in the New York Times, called the show \u201cslavery fan fiction.\u201d\n\nRather than outright cancel the project, Benioff and Weiss just sort of stopped talking about it \u2014 as did HBO, for the most part. The controversy died down, and the pair\u2019s Netflix deal effectively \u2014 and quietly \u2014 ended \u201cConfederate\u201d two years later. Excitement grew for the final season of GoT, and all seemed well for the two.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUntil it came out.\n\nFans and critics alike roundly criticized the show\u2019s final season. As this reporter wrote in May: \u201cMore than 1.4 million people have signed a petition on Change.org asking HBO to \u2018remake Game of Thrones Season 8 with competent writers.\u2019 \u2026 I love this story, and I, like most of you, was crushed to see how the last season (and Season 7, let\u2019s be real) has been handled.\u201d\n\nThe Internet has a fairly brief collective memory, but the missteps seem to be piling up for Benioff and Weiss, though a nine-figure Netflix deal is about as good as it gets (aside from, you know, launching a new Star Wars trilogy).\n\nBut if the past gives us any indication, whatever they come up with will probably be scrutinized more than just about anything else on the platform.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "They once seemed untouchable.
