The investigation, launched more than three years ago, determined that those 38 people were \"culpable\" in 91 cases of sending classified information that ended up in Clinton's personal email, according to a letter sent to Republican Senator Chuck Grassley this week and released Friday.\n\nThe 38 are current and former State Department officials but were not identified.\n\nAlthough the report identified violations, it said investigators had found \"no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.\" However, it also made clear that Clinton's use of private email had increased the vulnerability of sensitive data.\n\nClinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in a tweet Saturday: \"For the umpteenth time the email story is put to bed w/ a clear recognition it was a pointless crusade that took away from so many other issues we should have been discussing in '16.\"\n\nThe investigation covered 33,000 emails that Clinton turned over for review after her use of the private email account became public. The department said it found a total of 588 violations involving information then or now deemed to be classified but could not assign fault in 497 cases.\n\nFor current and former officials, culpability means the violations will be noted in their files and will be considered when they apply for or renew security clearances. For current officials, there could also be disciplinary action, though it's unclear how they could potentially be reprimanded.\n\nThe department began the review in 2016 after declaring 22 emails from Clinton's private server to be \"top secret.\" Clinton was then running for president against Donald Trump, and Mr. Trump made the server a major focus of his campaign.\n\nThen-FBI Director James Comey held a news conference that year in which he criticized Clinton as \"extremely careless\" in her use of the private email server as secretary of state but said the FBI would not recommend charges.\n\nThe Justice Department's inspector general said FBI specialists did not find evidence that the server had been hacked, with one forensics agent saying he felt \"fairly confident that there wasn't an intrusion.\"\n\nGrassley started investigating Clinton's email server in 2017, when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Iowa Republican has been critical of Clinton's handling of classified information and urged administrative sanctions.", "description": "Some of the current and former State Department officials cited may face disciplinary action", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/27/3a88746f-18ae-4537-8073-adcffd6e92cd/thumbnail/1200x630g1/d8bfe60f7fa78a378359c1c5ab0a20b0/gettyimages-1177474469.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
