When this decision became public, the backlash was so intense that GEDmatch made an abrupt policy change: All users were now by default excluded from law-enforcement searches unless they explicitly chose to opt in. So few users have opted in their profiles\u2014currently 163,000 out of 1.3 million DNA uploads\u2014GEDmatch has become only marginally useful in many criminal cases.\n\nThis single episode managed to inflame the fears of people on all sides of the law-enforcement debate. It showed the flimsiness of privacy protection by terms of service. It showed that police could push to expand the types of crimes investigated. It showed that access to DNA databases, for genealogists on criminal cases, could easily and abruptly be taken away.\n\nBut these fears had all been simmering for a long time, too, ever since the Golden State Killer case ripped open the possibility of solving crimes through genealogy.\n\nRead: How a genealogy website led to the Golden State Killer\n\nGenetic genealogists\u2014who use consumer DNA tests to build family trees\u2014had been a close-knit community. Many began as volunteers. The tools they use were created by volunteers. GEDmatch was originally created by volunteers. None of it was meant for criminal investigations. As the genealogist Shannon Christmas puts it, \u201cIt was built for finding ancestors. It was built for reuniting families, and now it is being used essentially to get families to put their members in jail.\u201d\n\nGenealogists have suddenly had to contend with the much higher stakes of their work, and genealogy databases have had to make up the rules as they go, scrambling to deal with backlash. \u201cEverybody\u2019s clamoring for guidance\u2014law enforcement, the companies, genealogists,\u201d says Blaine Bettinger, who writes the blog The Genetic Genealogist. The investigations have raced ahead\u2014until very recently\u2014without any guidelines.\n\nUsing genealogy to identify a suspect is not so different from, say, looking for the birth parents of an adoptee. The process begins with a DNA sample, uploaded to a database like GEDmatch. In most cases, the only matches will be distant cousins, but skilled genealogists are able to map out family trees by cross-referencing shared bits of DNA with public records, obituaries, and social-media profiles. In criminal cases, law enforcement may also contact family members for information or additional DNA to narrow down possible hits. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of follow-up that has to take place,\u201d says CeCe Moore, the chief genetic genealogist for Parabon NanoLabs, whose team has made about 70 identifications for law enforcement since it formed after the arrest of the Golden State Killer suspect.\n\nEarly on, genealogists settled on a tentative status quo for consulting GEDmatch\u2019s consumer DNA profiles in criminal cases: Law enforcement could use the site, but only for homicides and sexual assaults, as spelled out in its new terms of service.", "description": "Tools meant to reunite families are now being \u201cused essentially to get families to put their members in jail.\u201d", "authors": ["Sarah Zhang"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_18233691222251/facebook.jpg?1569962403", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
