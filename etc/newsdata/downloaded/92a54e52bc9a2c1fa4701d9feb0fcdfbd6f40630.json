It\u2019s all gossip.\u201d\n\nPressed several times whether that characterisation meant the story wasn\u2019t true, Morrison repeated his formulation. \u201cIt\u2019s gossip. I think I\u2019ve answered the question.\u201d\n\nMorrison toasts 'unconventional' Trump \u2013 but Hillsong pastor reportedly rejected from guest list Read more\n\nThe Wall Street Journal revealed Morrison had wanted the Hillsong Church pastor to be a guest at the state dinner at the Rose Garden in the White House, which included special guests Lachlan Murdoch (but not his father, Rupert), the billionaire box magnate Anthony Pratt, miners Andrew \u2018Twiggy\u2019 Forrest and Gina Rinehart, and the golfer Greg Norman.\n\nBut according to the Journal, the White House declined Morrison\u2019s request.\n\nHouston, the founder of the evangelical Hillsong Church, failed to alert the police about allegations his father, Frank, had sexually assaulted children, and had a conflict of interest when he assumed responsibility for dealing with the accusations, according to the findings of the 2014 royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.\n\nFrank Houston abused up to nine boys in Australia and New Zealand and, in its final report, the royal commission found multiple failings within the church executive \u2013 at the time led by Brian \u2013 in responding.\n\nMorrison attended the opening session of the Hillsong annual conference with his wife, Jenny, shortly after the May federal election. They are regulars at the event. Morrison told worshippers this year Australia needed more prayer and more love.\n\nToday\u2019s Pentecostals aren\u2019t tongues-talking hicks \u2013 they are slick Australian exports | Elle Hardy Read more\n\nA spokesman for Morrison did not deny the report, and on Friday evening local time said in a statement: \u201cInvitations to the state dinner are entirely at the discretion of the White House and, as has been the case previously, is expected to include people from all walks of life from politics to sport to business, entertainment, science and technology and religion.\u201d\n\nHouston said in a statement: \u201cI have had no invitation to the White House and I have had no discussion with the prime minister or anyone else about this.\n\n\u201cHillsong Church received no inquiry from any party as to my details or availability. As far as I\u2019m concerned this is baseless rumour and totally false news. It is extremely disappointing that media outlets spread these unfounded rumours, and attempts to link this untrue story to the royal commission are unconscionable.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday Labor MP Chris Bowen said it was up to Morrison to explain if there was an invitation.\n\n\u201cHe seems incapable of answering any question he doesn\u2019t want to answer,\u201d Bowen told reporters in Sydney.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s his modus operandi, he just says it\u2019s gossip.\n\n\u201cHe appears to think that level of transparency is good enough.\u201d\n\nAustralian Associated Press contributed this report", "description": "Prime minister dismisses reports he lobbied unsuccessfully to have Brian Houston attend state dinner", "authors": ["Katharine Murphy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f61b7efc6edc306cc8a920f769e3f5d0d24b14c/0_88_3508_2106/master/3508.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e8c03f150f7e32af625712c70aa473ba", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
