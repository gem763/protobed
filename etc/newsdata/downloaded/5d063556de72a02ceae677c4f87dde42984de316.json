The Turkish government is the bank\u2019s majority shareholder, and US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman claimed that its \u201caudacious conduct was supported and protected by high-ranking Turkish government officials.\u201d\n\nThe charges come amid the Turkish invasion of northern Syria, for which Trump has threatened to impose economic and financial penalties on Ankara. However, the president\u2019s critics at home hope this might turn into a scandal that helps them bring him down.\n\nBREAKING: SDNY charges Turkish state-run bank Halkbank in sanctions violations in connection with the record-breaking money-laundering scheme to Iran executed by gold trader Reza Zarrab.\n\n\n\nZarrab was the client whose release Giuliani pushed for between Trump and Erdogan. pic.twitter.com/pr4AA2dZyb \u2014 Adam Klasfeld (@KlasfeldReports) October 15, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani reportedly represented Reza Zarrab, one of the Halkbank executives who was charged with seven counts in relation to Iranian money-laundering and pleaded guilty in October 2017.\n\nCiting three anonymous sources, Bloomberg reported earlier this month that Trump tried to pressure then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to persuade the DOJ to drop the case against Zarrab, but Tillerson refused. This was supposedly done on behalf of Giuliani, who went on to become Trump\u2019s personal attorney in April 2018 and represent him in the \u2018Russiagate\u2019 investigation that eventually turned up empty.\n\nNYT and Washpost reporting add important new detail in the Reza Zarrab story: that Giuliani pitched Tillerson on a prisoner trade in early 2017. 1/5 https://t.co/ZQ3ICkGrKs \u2014 Nicholas Wadhams (@nwadhams) October 12, 2019\n\nThe alleged Trump-Giuliani-Zarrab connection has fueled speculation among the prominent #Resistance figures that they might have found something to actually pin on the president this time.\n\nIf Giuliani represented Zarrab *and* Trump and tried to convince Trump to help Zarrab, that is obviously unethical given the clear conflict of interest. https://t.co/O0PeSwiEoC \u2014 Renato Mariotti (@renato_mariotti) October 13, 2019\n\nI have a lot of questions about this \u2014 Trump trying to interfere with this case in SDNY against Turkey\u2019s Reza Zarrab https://t.co/jWYG3Z6PpM \u2014 Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) October 9, 2019\n\nFormer Obama White House officials have also chimed in, suggesting that Trump was seeking to help Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, rather than just his friend and future lawyer.\n\nAt the end of the Obama admin, Erdogan pushed us hard on the Zarrab case. Erdogan feared revelations about corruption would come out in court. We told him it wasn\u2019t appropriate for the WH to interfere in such cases.\n\n\n\nTrump wasn\u2019t just helping Rudy here. https://t.co/nrBi7913mK \u2014 Colin Kahl (@ColinKahl) October 9, 2019\n\nLast month, House Democrats opened what they say is an official impeachment probe, revolving around the claims of an anonymous intelligence community whistleblower that Trump used Giuliani to pressure Ukraine for \u201cdirt\u201d on Joe Biden, former vice-president and a candidate for the Democrats\u2019 2020 presidential nomination. As the inquiry was never authorized by a vote, however, the White House has refused to cooperate with the hearings.\n\nWhatever the fallout of the Halkbank case ends up being in the US, the charges are unlikely to make relations between Washington and Ankara any better. In an interview with Reuters last month, Erdogan said he hoped the US would not go after the bank, adding that it would be a \u201cmistake\u201d and \u201cnot a rational behavior.\u201d\n\nLike this story?
