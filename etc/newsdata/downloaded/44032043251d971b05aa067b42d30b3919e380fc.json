Now that collector's deceased estate is putting it on sale, and more than 500 lots of vintage and classic cars, trucks, spares, and automobilia is set to go on auction on 9 November.\n\nAmong the lots will be 70 vintage and classic cars as well as over 100,000 rare spare parts, says the joint venture auctioneers Bidway Auction House, based in Cape Town, and High Street Auctions headquartered in Johannesburg.\n\n\u201cThe collection was spread over the entire farm in bits. A few of the \u2018barn find\u2019 vehicles were dotted across the fields, while others were stored in barns amidst mountains of spares, much of which remained undisturbed and untouched for two decades,\u201d said Stef Olivier, MD at Bidway Auction House.\n\n\"This is without doubt the most exciting original automobilia private collection ever to go under the hammer in South Africa. We also believe it\u2019s the largest deceased estate and inheritance original classic car and barn find auction the country has seen in at least 20 years.\"\n\nIt took the auctioneers over four months to catalogue the collection comprising sedans, compacts, convertibles, and trucks. They span over six decades of European, British, and American automotive design.\n\nThe oldest vehicle is a 1928 Buick.\n\nIt is hard to estimate just what the hoard could fetch.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be very difficult to ascertain as we are technically selling under consent of the executor without reserves but subject to the approval of the Master of the High Court,\" Joff van Reenen, lead auctioneer and director High Street Auctions told Business Insider South Africa.\n\n\"There are no minimum bids as this is a deceased-estate auction. We can only guesstimate the total auction value to be in the millions. This is not a private sale but a legal instruction as such by the executor,\u201d said van Reenen.\n\nSome of the vehicles listed are in pristine condition and are expected to fetch a heavy price.\n\nBusiness Insider South Africa looked at some of the heavy hitters that will be going in auction, and ranked them on\"\u2018excellent condition\" valuations, vehicles that could drive on the road.\n\nWe matched the models as closely as we could with prices from the Hagerty Insurance Agency, which specialises in classic car insurance based in the United States, as well as prices from the online classified website ClassicCars.com.\n\nHere\u2019s what some of the top items in the hoard could fetch, roughly:\n\nA 1954 Mercedes-Benz Ponton 180: R380,000\n\nA 1948 Chevrolet convertible: R400,000\n\nA 1971 Ford Mustang: R500,000\n\nA 1928 Buick convertible: R500,000\n\nA 1936 Ford Roadster: R950,000\n\nA 1954 Austin Healy 100 Series convertible: R1 million\n\nA refundable registration fee of R20,000 is required to participate in the auction.\n\nOn the day of the sale live bids, telephone bids, online bids and commission bids will be accepted, and the entire auction will be live-streamed on various online channels.social media, Youtube, the High Street Auctions website and on the High Street app available free of charge on Google Play and the App Store.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "It took the auctioneers over four months to catalogue the collection which, if you count spare parts, runs to more than 100,000 items.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9411/71df31429c2a48ca8368d75f1a846a4e.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
