TechCrunch first reported the news.\n\nIn a statement, an Uber representative said the latest layoffs were another bid to find efficiencies in a now decade-old company and remain agile in a competitive field.\n\n\"Our hope with these changes is to reset and improve how we work day to day\u2014ruthlessly prioritizing, and always holding ourselves accountable to a high bar of performance and agility,\" the representative said.\n\n\"While certainly painful in the moment, especially for those directly affected, we believe that this will result in a much stronger technical organization, which going forward will continue to hire some of the very best talent around the world.\"\n\nTuesday's layoffs follow a hiring freeze in some departments in the United States as Uber seeks to cut costs and become profitable to appease anxious investors. That hiring freeze has since been lifted, the representative confirmed.\n\nMost of the layoffs were in the United States, TechCrunch reported, with another 15% in Asia and Europe. The California employment development department told Business Insider there was no WARN notice, a form that large companies generally have to file for large layoff events, filed by Uber this week, potentially signalling that many layoffs occurred outside of the state in other offices.\n\nRead more: Uber marketing employees describe a 'bloodbath' when the company laid off 400 workers\n\nEarlier in August, nervous engineers told Business Insider they feared they could be next. Other cost-cutting measures have included nixing the traditional balloons that employees receive on their work anniversaries and asking employees to be conscious about their travel expenses.\n\nAmong the cost-cutting efforts, however, are new investments that will expand Uber's presence well beyond its Silicon Valley roots. The company this week announced a $200 million investment in a new Chicago office to house a growing freight team, as well as a new office in Dallas to house sales and human resources employees.\n\nShares of Uber rose some 3.3% in trading Tuesday but remain more than 20% below initial trading prices following the company's massive IPO earlier this year.\n\nAre you an affected Uber employee?

We can keep you anonymous.\n\nHere's Uber's full statement regarding Tuesday's layoffs:\n\nOur CEO has asked everyone on our management team a simple but important question: if we started from scratch, would we design our organizations as they stand today? After careful consideration, our Engineering and Product leaders concluded the answer to this question in many respects was no. Previously, to meet the demands of a hyper-growth startup, we hired rapidly and in a decentralized way. While this worked for Uber in the past, now that we have over 27,000 full-time employees in cities around the world, we need to shift how we design our organizations: lean, exceptionally high-performing teams, with clear mandates and the ability to execute faster than our competitors. Today, we're making some changes to get us back on track, which include reducing the size of some teams to ensure we are staffed appropriately against our top priorities. These were incredibly difficult calls as it means some of our employees no longer have a role, specifically around 170 people in our Product group and 265 people in Engineering, which is roughly 8 percent of those two orgs. Our hope with these changes is to reset and improve how we work day to day\u2014ruthlessly prioritizing, and always holding ourselves accountable to a high bar of performance and agility. While certainly painful in the moment, especially for those directly affected, we believe that this will result in a much stronger technical organization, which going forward will continue to hire some of the very best talent around the world.\n\nMore Uber news:", "description": "The company previously laid off 400 marketing employees in July as it seeks to cut costs and appease anxious investors.", "authors": ["Graham Rapier"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5bd9d6dbf556fc338351abde-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
