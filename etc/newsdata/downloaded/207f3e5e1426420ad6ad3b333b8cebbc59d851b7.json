AAP\n\nNot that this has stopped Smith from setting up the new headquarters of the federal government\u2019s new foundation in Sydney.\n\nBut the opening of the Asia Society\u2019s Melbourne office is an example of the state\u2019s attempt to play a greater role in promoting the need for Victorian businesses to look offshore for growth as well as encourage investment and ties.\n\nIn the public service, this push has been strongly supported by Chris Eccles, head of the department of Premier and Cabinet in Victoria, who used to hold the same position in NSW.\n\nAsia Society board member Andrew Michelmore \u2013 Melbourne-based and business veteran in dealing with a range of Asian economies \u2013 says the organisation\u2019s expansion is logical given Victoria\u2019s cultural strengths as well as its multicultural history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the culture of Asian countries in order to develop the relationships and the trust,\u201d he says. \u201cThat takes time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe establishment of the office coincides with a new taskforce set up by the Asia Society and the Business Council of Australia to examine how companies can increase and diversify their presence in Asia. The plan is to present recommendations to governments within 12 months.\n\nThe taskforce is chaired by Mark van Dyck, head of Compass Group Asia Pacific, a food services company with $3.5 billion annual sales in Asia and nearly 70,000 employees.\n\n\u201cThe job of the taskforce will be to look at practical ways for Australian companies to build sustainable and successful businesses in Asia,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to focus on specifically how we can do that, for instance by identifying successful business models and what leadership skills are necessary to deliver results.\u201d\n\nPolitical leadership also remains a work in progress, especially when it comes to China.\n\nWarwick Smith, who is a former chair of the Asia Society among other roles, describes himself as an optimist who believes there will be a US-China trade deal. He also predicts Scott Morrison will be invited to visit Beijing sometime in the new year and that there is considerable diplomatic effort underway to facilitate this.\n\nSuch an outcome still seems remote right now \u2013 even with the determined efforts of the Morrison government to downplay the level of tension between Australia and its biggest trading partner.\n\nMorrison continues to focus publicly on the value of Australia\u2019s comprehensive strategic partnership with China and the great benefits of China\u2019s economic success \u2013 staking out a different position to the US on this despite mutual criticism of China\u2019s manipulation of trading rules.\n\nThe Prime Minister also insists he is not \"vexed\u201d by the lack of an invitation to visit Beijing, part of the diplomatic deep freeze with Beijing that has stymied high-level ministerial visits for two years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Philipp Ivanov is one of many experts describing the Australia China relationship as in the worst shape it has been for 30 years, since the Tiananmen Square massacre. He speaks from considerable experience as he was in charge of the China desk at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade before Smith persuaded him to head up the Asia Society.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a very different environment now,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s caused by clumsy statements or decisions by the Australian government. A lot of the current freeze and tensions have been caused by the actions of China itself and the responses to that.\n\n\u201cChina now is more global, more assertive, more powerful economically and more authoritarian. But we do need to find a way to engage with China. Whether we agree or disagree with its foreign policy trajectory or its economic policy trajectory, we have to better understand the thinking to know how best to deal with this.\u201d\n\nIvanov, who was born in Vladivostok, says the current situation with China is nothing like dealing with Russia, which had a weak economy and was an insignificant part of the global economy.\n\n\u201cChina is one face of the global economy and the US is the other face and we as a middle power need to find a way to engage with both, but it won\u2019t be easy.\u201d\n\nJust ask Scott Morrison.", "description": "Canberra's criticism of Victoria for signing up to China's Belt and Road Initiative has not stopped Daniel Andrews\u2019 focus on establishing greater engagement with Asia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2696%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_14/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4a15e9963ed27a02bf81af9914ec0f69774cf123", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
