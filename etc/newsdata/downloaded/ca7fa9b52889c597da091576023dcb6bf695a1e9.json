Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign.\n\nWarren has made breaking up big tech companies like Facebook a central point of her campaign.\n\nShe has also publicly criticized Facebook's decision to exempt political ads from its misinformation policy.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nFacebook employees have been in contact with Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign regarding the candidate's concerns with political ad policy, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told NBC Nightly News, and Bloomberg reported.\n\nZuckerberg has not spoken with Warren himself, and he did not elaborate on what exactly the staffers talk about. Facebook and the Warren campaign did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nWarren, a democratic candidate for president, has been vocally critical of Facebook. Breaking up big tech companies, including Facebook, is a key part of her campaign, and she has said that she would appoint regulators to undo anti-competitive mergers, such as Facebook's ownership of WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nIn leaked audio published by The Verge, Zuckerberg said that a Warren presidency would \"suck\" for Facebook.\n\nRead more: Breaking up big tech was a big topic of discussion at the most recent Democratic debate \u2014 here's where all the candidates stand\n\nWarren has also called out Facebook for running ads from the Trump campaign that made false claims about Joe Biden, another candidate. Facebook has had a \"newsworthiness exemption\" since 2016, meaning that it will leave up posts that violate community standards if \"the public interest in seeing it outweighs the risk of harm.\" It also does not apply the same fact-checking standards to political ads.\n\nFacebook tried to push back directly against Warren on Twitter, tagging her in a tweet, to which she responded: \"You're making my point here. It's up to you whether you take money to promote lies.\"\n\nMark Zuckerberg reportedly already has ties to at least one candidate in the race. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have been recommending staffers to the Buttigieg campaign, Bloomberg reported. Two of the staffers have been hired by the campaign.\n\nA spokesperson for the Zuckerberg-Chans told Bloomberg that the couple had not decided who to support for president.", "description": "Mark Zuckerberg told NBC Nightly News that Facebook staff has been in contact with the Warren campaign, although he hasn't spoken with her personally.", "authors": ["Mary Meisenzahl"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daf1327cc4a0a613b466362?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
