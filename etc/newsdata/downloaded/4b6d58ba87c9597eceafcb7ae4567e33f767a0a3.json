It will be done in the coming hours. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I am satisfied we managed to find it and reasonably confident it can be ratified by the British and European parliament.\u201d\n\nBELGIUM PM CHALRES MICHEL:\n\n\u201cIt is a step in the right direction, but I remain cautious. That\u2019s in my character, my temperament, because I know from experience that the devil is often in the detail. ...now it is necessary that the British parliament provides its approval.\u201d\n\nDUTCH PM MARK RUTTE:\n\n\u201cWell, (it\u2019s) very encouraging news that there is an agreement, now we have to study the details. But in itself very encouraging.\u201d\n\nFINNISH PM ANTTI RINNE:\n\n\u201cThe ball again is in the British Parliament(\u2018s court) ... I hope it goes through this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope we are now at the end of this process.
