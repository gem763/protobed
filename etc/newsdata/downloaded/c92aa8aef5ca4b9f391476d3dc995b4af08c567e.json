And I was thinking, \u201cHelp? But I\u2019m f***ed too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t want to f***ing phone the kid and tell him there\u2019s no hope. You don\u2019t want me on that phone call going, \u201cHey, I know you\u2019re only 24 right now but it can only get worse. It is going to get f***ing worse\u201d.\u2019\n\nLooking back, Robbie said he\u2019d now share words of wisdom \u2013 should Zayn have asked 18 months later.\n\nRobbie claims Zayn reached out (Picture: GC Images)\n\nHe said: \u2018I\u2019d take that phone call now, yeah. But at that particular time, you don\u2019t want me on that phone call.\u2019\n\nRobbie has previously battled drug and alcohol abuse but has now been sober for 19 years.\n\nHe can remember some of the lowest points of his substance abuse, including how he spent one Christmas Day high on speed whilst visiting sick children with Take That.\n\nThe performer said: \u2018We went to visit a children\u2019s hospital. I\u2019d been in the pub all night, and I necked a gram of speed and just carried on. I\u2019m in a children\u2019s hospital off my head on speed \u2026 and then the dramatic come down. Like a huge, huge comedown later on that day. So that was the Christmas in Take That I remember.\u2019\n\nThe Let Me Entertain You singer admitted that living in Los Angeles had put him in the way of temptation but those days are behind him now, especially as he spends a lot of his time at his home in England with his wife Ayda Field and their three children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobbie said: \u2018Weed is a bit like a chocolate bar. If there\u2019s a Kit Kat in the room, I\u2019m going to eat the damn Kit Kat. In LA, weed is now like having a coffee.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk contacted Zayn\u2019s reps for comment.\n\nNeed support?
