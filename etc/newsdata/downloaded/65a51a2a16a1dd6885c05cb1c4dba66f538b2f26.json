Hints of Unease in China\u2019s Leadership", "language": "en", "text": "The government\u2019s deepest fear now appears to be that the demands for greater political accountability and even universal suffrage heard on the streets in Hong Kong could spread like a contagion through the mainland. So far, there have been few signs of that.\n\nAs the crisis has grown, the government has dispatched thousands of troops from the People\u2019s Armed Police to Shenzhen, the mainland city adjacent to Hong Kong, but the exercise was hastily organized and used an outdated plan drawn up after the protests in 2014, according to one official in Hong Kong.\n\nBeijing also stepped up its propaganda, launching an information \u2014 and disinformation \u2014 campaign against the protesters and opposition leaders in Hong Kong.\n\nMr. Xi continues to barely mention Hong Kong. He has said nothing about the protests, even in his passing reference on Tuesday. He has not visited since 2017, when he marked the 20th anniversary of the handover from Britain.\n\nAfter the traditional August holiday break, Mr. Xi\u2019s public calendar of events has since betrayed no hint of political upheaval or threats to his standing. The media\u2019s portrayal of him, already verging on hagiography, became even more fawning. State television and the party\u2019s newspapers now refer to him as \u201cthe People\u2019s Leader,\u201d an honorific once bestowed only on Mao.\n\n\u201cThe People\u2019s Leader loves the people,\u201d The People\u2019s Daily wrote after Mr. Xi toured Gansu, a province in western China.\n\nMr. Xi\u2019s calculation might be simply to remain patient, as he has been in the case of President Trump\u2019s erratic shifts in the trade war. In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Xi also gave a possible hint of the government\u2019s pragmatism.\n\n\u201cOn matters of principle, not an inch will be yielded,\u201d he said, \u201cbut on matters of tactics there can be flexibility.\u201d", "description": "Beijing\u2019s halting response to the protests in Hong Kong has raised questions about President Xi Jinping\u2019s imperious style and authoritarian policies.", "authors": ["Steven Lee Myers", "Chris Buckley", "Keith Bradsher"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/07/world/07china-hongkong-1/07china-hongkong-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
