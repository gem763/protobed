An IMF mission team arriving on September 10 for the second and third review will unlock the remainder of about $56 million of the loan, he added.\n\n\u201cExternal borrowing will be contracted with careful consideration to ensure realisation of value for money,\u201d Mwanamvekha said.", "description": "Malawi expects its gross domestic product to expand by 5% in 2019 and by 7% in 2020 as the return of rainfall after severe drought boosts agricultural production, Finance Minister Joseph Mwanamvekha said on Monday in an annual budget speech.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
