Many of them are not Kurds. Critics have warned this could lead to ethnic cleansing of the local Kurdish population.\n\nWhat do we know about the deal?\n\nThe Kurdish-led administration in northern Syria said the Syrian army would deploy along the entire length of the border as part of the agreement.\n\nThis deployment would assist the SDF in countering \"this aggression and liberating the areas that the Turkish army and mercenaries had entered\", it said in a statement.\n\nThe move also \"paves the way to liberate the rest of the Syrian cities occupied by the Turkish army such as Afrin\", it added.\n\nTurkish forces and pro-Turkey Syrian rebels forced Kurdish fighters from Afrin back in 2018 after a two-month operation.\n\nThe deal represents a significant shift in alliances for the Kurds, after losing the military protection of their long-term US partners in the area.\n\nIt is not yet known what the Syrian government has committed to.\n\nHowever SDF chief Mazloum Abdi acknowledged \"there would be painful compromises\" with the Assad government and its Russian allies, in a piece for Foreign Policy magazine.\n\n\"We do not trust their promises. To be honest, it is hard to know whom to trust,\" he writes.\n\n\"But if we have to choose between compromises and the genocide of our people, we will surely choose life for our people.\"\n\nThe deal follows US President Donald Trump's surprise move last week to pull dozens of troops from pockets in the north-east, effectively paving the way for the Turkish operation against the Kurdish fighters.\n\nAt the time, the SDF called the move \"a stab in the back\".\n\nWhat about the latest US withdrawal?\n\nUS Defence Secretary Mark Esper earlier announced the Pentagon was moving up to 1,000 troops away from the north after learning that Turkey was pushing further into Syria than previously expected.\n\nDescribing the situation there as \"untenable\", he said the SDF had been \"looking to cut a deal\" with the Syrian government and Russia to counter the Turkish attack.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Turkey \"likely intends\" to push west and south, says US Defence Secretary Mark Esper\n\nThis, he continued, would leave the US forces stuck between \"two opposing advancing armies\".\n\nHours after Mr Esper's comments, Syria said it was deploying its forces to the north to \"confront a Turkish aggression\". It is not yet clear where exactly the troops are being sent.\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump tweeted that it was \"very smart\" not to be involved in the fighting \"for a change\", saying engagement in Middle East conflict was a mistake.\n\nWhat has Turkey seized so far ?\n\nTurkey is pushing deeper into northern Syria.\n\nOn Sunday, President Erdogan said his forces had already captured 109 sq km (42 square miles) of territory, including 21 villages.\n\nHe told reporters the key border town of Ras al-Ain had come under Turkish control - though the SDF said they had pushed Turkish forces back to the town's outskirts.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Turkish-backed forces enter the border town of Tal Abyad\n\nMr Erdogan said Turkish forces had also besieged the town of Tal Abyad, some 120km (75 miles) away.\n\nThe UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said Turkey was in almost complete control there.\n\nBoth Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad are key goals in the Turkish offensive against the Kurdish-led SDF forces.\n\nTurkey also announced that its Syrian allies on the ground had seized a key motorway - called M4 - some 30-35km south of the border.\n\nWhat are the casualty figures?\n\nThey're rising, with civilians killed on both sides of the border:\n\nMore than 50 civilians and over 100 Kurdish fighters killed in north-eastern Syria, SOHR says\n\nSDF says the Kurdish forces' death toll is 56 and Turkey gives a higher figure of 440\n\nEighteen civilians killed in southern Turkey, according to Turkish reports\n\nFour Turkish soldiers and 16 pro-Turkish Syrian fighters killed in Syria, Turkey says\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Martin Patience explains what's behind the conflict\n\nWhat about IS?\n\nThe fighting has spilled over to areas close to IS detainee camps.\n\nFears that Kurdish forces will be unable to keep IS prisoners confined appeared to have been realised when officials at the Ain Issa camp said nearly 800 relatives of foreign IS members had escaped.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amira, Heba and Hamza are stranded, in danger and they want to come home\n\nThe SOHR said the number of people who fled was 100. It not known where they have fled to.\n\nThe camp holds about 12,000 displaced people, previously including nearly 1,000 foreign women and children with jihadist links.\n\nThe SDF says it is currently holding more than 12,000 suspected IS members in seven prisons, and at least 4,000 of them are foreign nationals.\n\nIS has claimed recent car bombings and on Saturday declared a new campaign in Syria.\n\nTurkey says it will take responsibility for IS prisoners it finds during its offensive.", "description": "Syrian government forces will be deployed along Syria's northern border to halt Turkey's assault.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0962/production/_109220420_2f33006d-cf97-4021-a3d7-5b6a7b1f25a4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
