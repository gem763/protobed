School officials say the teacher took out his phone to show the student some photos of his hometown when suddenly a photo of a female\u2019s genitals appeared on the screen. When the student looked shocked, the teacher became flustered and quickly closed the screen.\n\nOn Aug 21, during the school\u2019s summer vacation period, a female student was studying with a fellow female student in a classroom when the ALT walked in. School officials say the girl\u2019s friend left the room and the teacher then struck up a conversation about cooking with the remaining student. He took out his smartphone to show the student some meals on his phone, and the girl commented on how tasty the meals looked. As he swiped through the photos, a picture of a man\u2019s genitals suddenly appeared on the screen. When the student appeared lost for words, the teacher continued swiping, acting as if they hadn\u2019t seen the image.\n\nOne week later, when the girl he had shown the image to was studying alone in a classroom, the teacher entered the room and struck up a casual conversation. While they were talking, the teacher dropped his keys and bent down to pick them up. When he stood up, his shorts fell down, exposing the lower half of his body. When the girl looked dumbfounded, the teacher pulled up his shorts, said sorry, and went to leave the room.\n\nAs he turned to walk away, his shorts fell down again, exposing his genitals.\n\nThe following day, on Aug 29, the female student told a female teacher what had happened. According to the schoolgirl, the male teacher was not wearing anything underneath his shorts when they fell down, but the teacher claims he was wearing underwear at the time and didn\u2019t mean for his shorts to slip.\n\nThe teacher also claims he doesn\u2019t recall showing the male student inappropriate images.\n\nThe teacher\u2019s improper conduct led to him being dismissed from the school. It has not yet been revealed which company or organization was responsible for hiring the ALT.\n\nBecause as we know, there\u2019s already been enough stories of bad teachers in schools recently.\n\nSource: Nikkan Gendai via Excite News\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Japanese high school teacher in hot water after forcibly giving male student a buzz cut\n\n-- Board of education suspends Japanese teacher who stockpiled 750 pairs of panties at school\n\n-- Japanese teacher gives secret love letter to junior high schoolgirl, gets his heart broken\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/29/american-english-teacher-fired-from-japanese-high-school-after-exposing-genitals/SoraNews24\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "A 29-year-old American assistant language teacher (ALT) was fired from a prefectural high school in Saitama Prefecture on Oct 24, after incidents of improper conduct with students came to light.
