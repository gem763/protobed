In the caption, she revealed the pain and bloating she is experiencing as a result of the procedure.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cFirst, I want to preface this by saying that when I took this photo, I didn\u2019t realise how much of a prego pose this was,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo no, this isn\u2019t what it seems.\n\n\u201cThis is actually the bloating that lasted five solid DAYS from the egg retrieval. A part of me isn\u2019t sure what was more painful, the procedure itself or the bloating that resulted from it. The answer is probably both.\u201d\n\nDuring egg retrieval, which is done so that the eggs can be fertilised by a man\u2019s sperm, a woman is sedated and an ultrasound probe is inserted into the vagina to identify follicles, before a thin needle is inserted into the follicles to retrieve the eggs, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nWomen typically experience cramping and feelings of fullness after the procedure.\n\nBut, according to Victoria, the bloating was just part of the recovery, as she also experienced intense pain following the procedure and couldn\u2019t \u201csit or stand or even move for the first three days without wincing in pain or bracing myself\u201d.\n\n\"I know it doesn't look that bad, but it felt a lot worse than it looked,\" she said.\n\nIn the caption, she explained that she decided to share her honest experience on Instagram as part of the #whatimgoingthru online campaign, which reflects on the impacts social media has on mental health.\n\n\u201cThere have been so many physical, mental, and emotional ups and downs this last year. And while I\u2019m resilient AF, I\u2019m not going to pretend it\u2019s been easy, and I don\u2019t want to pretend,\u201d Victoria wrote.\n\nIn response to her post, which has been liked more than 21,000 times, Victoria\u2019s followers have praised her for her transparency and honesty.\n\n\u201cThank you for sharing! I struggle with infertility too and love seeing the truth behind all of the options,\u201d one woman wrote.\n\nAnother commented: \u201cThank you so much for posting this\u2026 I went through the exact same thing about a month ago\u2026 I was unpleasantly surprised how bloated and painful my post-retrieval was as well.\n\n\u201cI am a labour and delivery nurse and I wish I had been given more knowledge about the difficult recoveries that some of us have.\u201d", "description": "A fitness influencer who has been documenting her attempts to get pregnant has shared a photo of her bloated stomach to show a lesser-known side effect of IVF.\u00a0 Anna Victoria has been sharing her IVF progress on Instagram, where she has more than 1.2m followers since she started the infertility treatments almost\u00a0two years ago\u00a0alongside her husband Luca Ferretti.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/19/screen-shot-2019-10-02-at-2.02.10-pm.png"}
