Way too early to discuss polling in any serious measure, especially in the absence of a Democratic nominee, but the liberal media loves to trot out their trash polls about the president\u2019s approval ratings and support for impeachment in what could be argued as a prolonged campaign to demoralize the GOP base. It won\u2019t. If anything, how the liberal media has behaved over the past three years has only become one massive in-kind contribution to Trump\u2019s re-elect as everyone sees through their bias, lies, and gross incompetence. How many times were we told about Russian collusion? It was a myth. How many times have we heard the \u2018walls are closing in\u2019 on this presidency? They\u2019re not. There\u2019s a reason why the media is distrusted. There\u2019s a reason why \u2018CNN sucks\u2019 remains a popular chant. The inability for the media to cover this White House accurately has reached epic proportions and frankly, it\u2019s to the point where it\u2019s no longer digesting information. We're tuning into these networks to get a good laugh and gauge how Trump Derangement Syndrome has engulfed the Left. The reality is that there is good news emanating from this administration.\n\nJob creation is solid with over three million jobs created. Paychecks are larger. Consumer and small business confidence have reached their highest marks in years. The economy is booming. And if the recent Democratic debate showed you anything, it\u2019s that the economic growth we\u2019re seeing would be torpedoed. The Democrats want to give health care to illegals, promote open borders, bash cops, increase taxes, force everyone on government health care, coupled with massive tax increases, confiscate guns, and permit abortion up until the moment of birth on the taxpayer dime. Yeah, it\u2019s a debate between freedom and slavery\u2014and the Left argues the latter as some great alternative to Trump. Oh, and Medicare for All, which is what Democrats now endorse, would cannibalize all private health insurance plans. That\u2019s around 150 million plans. So, for all the conniption fits about the GOP taking away people\u2019s health care, well\u2014the Democrats are the ones actually proposing that this year and thinking it\u2019s a popular and economically sound policy. So, would it shock you, given the left-wing Democratic agenda that will thrust economic destitution upon many, that we have a 2020 projection where Trump wins re-election handily (via The Hill):\n\nPresident Trump appears likely to win reelection next year, according to three different economic models Moody\u2019s Analytics uses to measure presidential contests. Moody\u2019s modeling, which has only missed on one presidential election since 1980, found that Trump, who won by a 304-227 margin in the Electoral College in 2016, could easily surpass those results in 2020. I guess we should serve this piping hot cup of shut the hell up concerning the 2020 projection by pollster Mark Zandi. Spoiler: it\u2019s very bad for Democrats. The three different models showed Trump winning either 289, 332 or 351 votes in the Electoral College over his eventual opponent. The projections are based on how consumers feel about their financial situations, stock market gains achieved under Trump and the prospects for unemployment. \u201cIf the economy a year from now is the same as it is today, or roughly so, then the power of incumbency is strong and Trump\u2019s election odds are very good, particularly if Democrats aren\u2019t enthusiastic and don\u2019t get out to vote,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics and co-author of the paper, told CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s about turnout.\u201d Of the three models, Trump performs best under the \u201cpocketbook\u201d measure, which gauges how people feel about their finances.\n\nSo, yeah\u2014this is a piping hot cup of shut the hell up that should be served to the Left. your agenda sucks. The voters know it. you have no slid frontrunner who can beat Trump right now. Elizabeth Warren cannot answer a simple question about the impact her forced Medicare plan will have on taxes and the middle class. That\u2019s because everyone knows taxes will go up and the middle class will be torched by this policy. Bernie Sanders just had a heart attack. And Joe Biden is dealing with the fallout from his son\u2019s alleged unethical business deal in Ukraine, along with forgetting where he is half the time and babbling incoherent nonsense on the debate stage. With a solid economy, a far-left agenda, and a weak Democratic candidate who will be shredded by the Trump campaign\u2019s excellent attack machine\u2014I can see a landslide coming.", "description": ".10/19/2019 6:49:46AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/291/1b12e6c0-5924-4fd9-bd59-ed3c92325d6c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
