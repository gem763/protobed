Chelsea will be aiming to stop Jurgen Klopp\u2019s men from picking up six wins from six.\n\nAfter their midweek European exploits, here is how we think the league\u2019s heavyweights will line up this weekend.\n\nSpurs (vs Leicester)\n\nMauricio Pochettino is likely to rotate his full-backs from the game against Olympaicos, with Danny Rose and Serge Aurier set to start in place of Ben Davies and Davinson Sanchez.\n\nTanguy Ndombele may also drop out of the side after a poor performance midweek, with Moussa Sissoko likely to return as Spurs revert to a diamond in midfield.\n\nGiovanni Lo Celso is Spurs\u2019 only long-term absentee, and the game will come too early for either Ryan Sessengon or Juan Foyth to be involved.\n\nManchester City (vs Watford)\n\nWith John Stones and Aymeric Laporte injured, Fernandinho is set to continue his role as a makeshift centre-back alongside Nicolas Otamendi.\n\nBenjamin Mendy came on midweek, but Oleksandr Zinchenko has been playing well and should keep his place for this game at least as Mendy continues to build match fitness.\n\nSergio Aguero and David Silva were rested against Shakhtar, and both are expected to come back into Guardiola\u2019s line-up.\n\nManchester United (vs West Ham)\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed that Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial and Luke Shaw are all unavailable for the game at the Olympic Stadium.\n\nSolskjaer rotated heavily in the Europa League, with the likes of Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Scott McTominay all set to be recalled.\n\nDan James is questionable after missing training this week, and Mason Greenwood could be handed his first league start of the season after scoring against FC Astana.\n\nArsenal (vs Aston Villa)\n\nArsenal also afforded a lot of his players a break in the Europa League, and Ainsley-Maitland Niles, Matteo Guendouzi and Nicolas Pepe are all in line to start against Villa after being rested.\n\nHector Bellerin and Kieran Tierney are continuing their recovery, but this match will be too soon for them as they prepare to play for the U23 side this week.\n\nRob Holding has already featured for the U23s, and may make the matchday squad.\n\nChelsea (vs Liverpool)\n\nFrank Lampard is likely to continue with a back three as he seeks defensive stability for Chelsea.\n\nLampard has confirmed that Mason Mount has a chance of featuring, after picking up a knock against Valencia. He has said that \u201cno risks will be taken, however\u201d with regards to Mount or N\u2019Golo Kante.\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi, Reece James and Antonio Rudiger are all major doubts and unlikely to play a part.\n\nLiverpool (vs Chelsea)\n\nThis game will come too soon for Naby Keita, but Jurgen Klopp did not rule out a return for Divock Origi who missed the Champions League defeat to Napoli.\n\nRoberto Firmino should come in for Origi after starting on the bench against Newcastle last weekend.\n\nAlex-Oxlade Chamberlain and Gini Wijnaldum are also likely to be recalled after both were dropped in Naples.", "description": "There is plenty of action to look forward to this weekend in the Premier League, and Saturday begins with Spurs looking to forget their 2-2 slip-up against Olympiacos on Wednesday as they host Leicester City.
