Such intelligence, if shared publicly, could further pressure Washington, Riyadh and others to respond, perhaps even militarily.\n\nIran denies involvement in the strikes. Iran\u2019s allies in Yemen\u2019s civil war, the Houthi movement, claimed responsibility for the attacks. The Houthis say they struck the plants with drones, some of which were powered by jet engines.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said it looked as if Iran - which has a long history of friction with neighbor Saudi Arabia - was behind the attacks.\n\nBut in a sign that U.S. allies remain unconvinced, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said he was unsure if anyone had any evidence to say whether drones \u201ccame from one place or another.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia sought to reassure markets after the attack on Saturday halved oil output, saying on Tuesday that full production would be restored by month\u2019s end.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday ruled out talks with the United States unless the Trump administration returns to the nuclear accord between Iran and the West that the United States abandoned last year.\n\n\u201cIranian officials, at any level, will never talk to American officials ... this is part of their policy to put pressure on Iran,\u201d Iranian state TV quoted him as saying.\n\nTrump on Tuesday said he is not looking to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during a U.N. event in New York this month.\n\nU.S.-Iran relations deteriorated after Trump quit the nuclear pact and reimposed sanctions over Tehran\u2019s nuclear and ballistic programmes, severely hurting the Iranian economy. Trump also wants Iran to stop supporting regional proxies, including Yemen\u2019s Houthis.\n\nIran\u2019s clerical rulers openly support the Houthis, who are fighting a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, but Tehran denies that it actively supports the Yemeni group with military and financial support.\n\nDespite years of air strikes against them, the Houthi militia boasts drones and missiles able to reach deep into Saudi Arabia, the result of an armament campaign pursued and expanded energetically since Yemen\u2019s war began four years ago.\n\nStrains between Washington and Tehran have risen more in recent months after attacks on tankers in the Gulf that the United States blames on Tehran, and Iran\u2019s downing of a U.S. military drone that prompted preparations for a retaliatory air strike that Trump says he called off at the last minute.\n\nSAUDI DOUBTS\n\nSaudi Arabia has asked international experts to join its investigation, which indicates the attacks did not come from Yemen, the Saudi foreign ministry said.\n\nOne of the three U.S. officials expressed confidence that Saudi Arabia\u2019s collection of materials following the attacks would yield \u201ccompelling forensic evidence ... that will point to where this attack came from.\u201d\n\nA U.S. team is helping Saudi Arabia evaluate evidence from the attacks, which hit crucial facilities of Saudi state-owned oil company Aramco in Abqaiq and Khurais and initially cut Saudi oil production in half.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Fires burn in the distance after a drone strike by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group on Saudi company Aramco's oil processing facilities, in Buqayq, Saudi Arabia September 14, 2019 in this still image taken from a social media video obtained by REUTERS\n\nThe Saudi energy minister said on Tuesday that the kingdom will achieve 11 million barrels per day (bpd) capacity by the end of September.\n\nMinister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman also told a news conference that the world\u2019s top oil exporter would keep full oil supplies to customers this month.\n\nHe said Saudi Arabia would keep its role as the secure supplier of global oil markets, adding that the kingdom needed to take strict measures to prevent further attacks, which exposed the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry and the broader global economy.\n\nOil prices fell 5% after the news that Saudi production is back, having surged more than 20% at one point on Monday - the biggest intra-day jump since the 1990-91 Gulf crisis over Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait.\n\nA day after warning that the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to respond to the Saudi incident, Trump dialed down his rhetoric, saying on Monday there was \u201cno rush\u201d to do so and that Washington was coordinating with Gulf Arab and European states.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking at options right now. We want to find definitively who did this,\u201d Trump said.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo was traveling to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said the Iran nuclear pact, which European parties are trying to salvage, is one building block \u201cwe need to get back to\u201d.\n\nSaudi Arabia, which has supported tougher U.S. sanctions on Iran, said an initial investigation showed the strikes were carried out with Iranian weapons.\n\nGalip Dalay, a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Doha Center think tank, said the sophistication of the attacks and the fact such an operation would require high-level approval pointed at Tehran.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cIran is essentially saying, \u2018If I can\u2019t get my oil into international markets, then no one should be able to do it\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are basically looking to destabilize an international market that they have been cut out of by U.S. sanctions.\u201d\n\n(The story makes clear in paragraphs 7 and 19 that full production is expected to be restored only by the end of September)", "description": "The United States believes the attacks that crippled Saudi Arabian oil facilities last weekend originated in southwestern Iran, a U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday, an assessment that further increases tension in the Middle East.", "authors": ["Phil Stewart", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430951800&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1MW", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
