He's been struggling for more than a month, with four of his five blown saves coming since July 12 along with a 5.68 ERA in the second half.\n\nThe Indians sent him home from California on Thursday for an MRI that was clear.\n\nHand said he's never dealt with anything similar during his career.\n\n''I didn't know what was going on,'' he said. ''It's been kind of bugging me for a little bit and we tried to treat it a little bit and it just wasn't bouncing back. It's like those first two games in Minnesota playing catch I felt good and then pitching that game I felt all right and then the next day I just didn't feel good that first day in L.A. We just figured we'd get it checked out, see what's going on, and it was a relief to find out everything was OK.''\n\nThe Indians are eager to see how Karinchak performs at the big league level, and Francona is unlikely to use him in a high-leverage situation right away.\n\nBut the club needed another late-inning option with Hand sidelined, and Francona might see how the right-hander responds.\n\nStory continues\n\n''At worst, what it does is, it gives us a read on where this kid is going into spring training,'' Francona said. ''It's about impossible to evaluate somebody in spring training that you don't know. Maybe this kid comes up and gets everybody out.''\n\nKarinchak averaged a jaw-dropping 22 strikeouts per nine innings. He fanned 74 of the 125 batters he faced.\n\nAlong with a fastball and slider, he's got plenty of confidence.\n\n''I'm just trying to get outs and trying to execute pitches,'' he said. ''If I execute pitches they usually don't hit them.''\n\nFrancona said the reports he's received on the 2017 draft pick have been overly positive.\n\n''There's some things that we don't know about him because they haven't happened yet,'' Francona said. ''That's not his fault. You talk about the running game, fielding his position. When guys don't hit it, it's hard to blame the kid. He's striking everybody out. Is that gonna play, how's it gonna play here? There's one way to find out. But the experience, again, at worst will be really good for him.''\n\nThe Indians also recalled outfielder Bradley Zimmer, who has been rehabbing his surgically repaired right shoulder and other injuries.\n\nZimmer played in 34 games for the Indians last season before he was shut down. He had surgery in July and was close to being recovered when he strained his right oblique.\n\nFrancona said Zimmer, who had 18 steals for Cleveland in 2017, will initially be used in pinch-running situations.\n\n---\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports", "description": "While they wait for their current closer, the Indians brought up their likely next one.
