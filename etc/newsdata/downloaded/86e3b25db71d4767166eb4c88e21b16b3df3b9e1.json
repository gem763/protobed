They\u2019ve also refused to backfill funds for projects affected by Trump\u2019s reprogramming.\n\n\n\n\u201cThose diversions are going to have to be addressed one way or another, otherwise it will be very hard to finish our work on all 12 appropriations bills, including this one,\u201d said Sen.

The resolution did not get the two-thirds majority needed to overturn Trump\u2019s veto, but the Senate is set to vote on a second such resolution Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stand up, we\u2019ve got to be a Senate, we\u2019ve got to be a legislative body. If we don\u2019t there\u2019s no need for us to be here. No need at all if we can\u2019t do our job,\u201d said Manchin, who is expected to be the lone Democrat supporting the Homeland Security bill on Thursday.\n\n\n\nSen. John Kennedy John Neely KennedyMORE (R-La.), another appropriator, said he supported the wall but raised concerns about the costs.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe built 2,700 miles of walls along our interstates in America for $4 billion, about $1.5 million per mile,\u201d he said Tuesday. The plan in question put the wall\u2019s cost at $20.8 million per mile.\n\n\n\n\u201cI understand these border walls are a lot more complicated,\u201d Kennedy said, before adding, \u201cI sure hope somebody\u2019s watching the contractors.\u201d\n\nTo prevent a shutdown, the Senate is preparing to approve a stopgap measure on Wednesday that would keep the government funded until Nov. 21. Trump is expected to sign the bill, which was approved by the House last week.\n\n\n\nStaff-level discussions between the two chambers have begun in hopes of finding a consensus on spending for the entirety of the fiscal year, but the path forward remains unclear and additional stopgaps may be necessary.\n\nThe wall is one reason for the uncertainty. Last December, Congress\u2019s refusal to provide Trump with the $5.7 billion he requested for the wall led to a 35-day partial government shutdown, the longest in the nation\u2019s history.\n\n\n\nThe final 2019 spending bill provided under $1.4 billion to build 55 miles of new border fencing in Texas, but also led Trump to declare an emergency allowing him to reprogram other funds for his top campaign issue.\n\nThis story was updated at 5:05 p.m.", "description": "Senate Republicans on Tuesday unveiled a spending bill that includes $5 billion for President Trump\u2019s proposed border wall, setting up a battle with Democrats that could prompt a government shutdown.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/borderwall_construction_061819getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
