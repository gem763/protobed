Huawei was later granted a 90-day reprieve. After Samsung, Huawei is the biggest cellphone brand in South Africa.\n\n\n\nChina's ambassador to Pakistan, Lijian Zhao, tweeted a joke on Monday about President Donald Trump's executive order. \"Look at the logo of Huawei,\" he said. \"It has cut APPLE into pieces.\" He included a photo of Huawei's logo, Apple's logo, and a sliced apple for comparison:\n\n\n\nBREAKING: It has been just revealed why @realDonaldTrump hated a private company from China so much that it went so far by announcing a national emergency. Look at the logo of Huawei. It has cut APPLE into pieces... pic.twitter.com/KOXstlAsja \u2014 Lijian Zhao \u00e8\u00b5\u00b5\u00e7\u00ab\u2039\u00e5\u009d\u0161 (@zlj517) May 20, 2019\n\nHuawei is the second-largest smartphone producer in the world - despite being essentially locked out of the US market. Apple is the third-largest, after being overtaken by Huawei in March, according to International Data Corp.\n\nThis isn't the first time the logos have been compared. 9 to 5 Mac reports that the joke has become a feature of the \"boycott Apple\" movement in China.\n\nBut the joke backfired somewhat when people pointed out that the tweet appeared to have been sent from an iPhone, as when viewed in TweetDeck it displayed \"Twitter for iPhone.\"\n\nThis wouldn't be the first time a Huawei fan tweeted support for the company from an iPhone. In January, two Huawei employees were demoted and had their pay docked for tweeting a New Year's greeting from the official company account on an iPhone.\n\nHuawei's leadership also doesn't seem averse to using Apple products. CFO Meng Wanzhou was carrying a bunch of Apple devices when she was arrested in December, and CEO Ren Zhengfei told Chinese state television this week that he admired Apple and bought iPhones for his family when abroad.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The tweet followed the Trump administration's blacklisting of the Chinese technology giant Huawei, an Apple competitor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8764/69e74786a8c24feaaf49d8077e0e28e4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-02"}
