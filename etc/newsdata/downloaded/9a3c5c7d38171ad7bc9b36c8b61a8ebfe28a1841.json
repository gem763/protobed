With such a devastating disease that affects tens of millions worldwide, today\u2019s announcement is truly heartening in the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s.\u2019\n\nBiogen says it will seek approval for the medicine to be available in the US, Japan and Europe in the next two years (Picture: AFP)\n\nThe announcement came as a surprise to those in the field because earlier this year, Biogen stopped two studies of the drug when partial results suggested it was not likely to be successful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company now says a new analysis of more results suggest the drug helped reduce a decline of thinking skills at the highest dose.\n\nAducanumab aims to help the body clear harmful plaques from the brain and is being developed by Biogen and a Japanese drugs company, Eisai.\n\nMillions of people worldwide have been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nCurrent drugs only temporarily ease symptoms but do not slow the loss of memory and thinking skills.\n\nDozens of efforts to develop a drug to slow or reverse the course of the disease have so far failed.\n\nBut Biogen said its trial data is strong enough to apply for medicine licences in the US, Europe and Japan early next year.\n\nExperts have welcomed the \u2018transformative discovery\u2019 as a \u2018hugely exciting\u2019 breakthrough that could be life changing for dementia patients.\n\nMillions of people across the world are diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 the most common form of dementia (Picture: Getty)\n\nWhat was the study? Biogen carried out two studies testing aducanumab in more than 3,000 patients with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s. Aducanumab was given as monthly infusions. In one study, those given a high dose showed 23 per cent less decline on one measure of thinking skills and smaller declines on other measures. However, no details were given on how much that decline meant in absolute terms. The company did not say how much difference it made in practical matters, like whether patients were able to dress or feed themselves or live independently longer. It just stated that these skills overall \u2018declined less\u2019 for those on the high dose of the drug.\n\nDrugs available at the moment are not able to slow the loss of brain function, they are only able to temporarily ease symptoms (Picture: AP)\n\nDr Ronald Petersen, a dementia specialist who consulted for Biogen on the studies said \u2018it\u2019s a tricky question\u2019 whether the results are truly meaningful for patients until more details are known.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he added that filing for approval from the FDA \u2018gives some hopes for patients and families that there may be disease-modifying therapies out there\u2019.\n\nThe company said more details would be given at a conference in December, including on safety.\n\nAre there any side effects? The company said the most common side effects were headaches and inflammation in the brain, most of which did not cause symptoms or lasting problems. The brain inflammation has been seen in other studies of Alzheimer\u2019s medicines that target the brain plaques.\n\nRebecca Edelmayer, a scientist at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, said: \u2018We\u2019re really encouraged by the information that [Biogen] has provided\u2019 and added it is the \u2018largest benefit so far\u2019 for any experimental medicine.\n\nBiogen said it would offer aducanumab now to patients enrolled in studies of it.\n\nIf the applications for licenses are successful, it is hoped the medicine could be available within two years.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
