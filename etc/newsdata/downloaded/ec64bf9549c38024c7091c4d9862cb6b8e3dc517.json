It didn\u2019t come from nowhere, people are upset about these cars.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018SUV madness\u2019: business newspaper Handelsblatt\u2019s edition questioning the marketing tactics of car manufacturers. Photograph: \u00a9 Handelsblatt Media Group\n\nThe following day hundreds of Berliners gathered at a vigil for those killed, calling for a ban on SUVs. Stephan von Dassel, the district mayor of Berlin-Mitte, said \u201carmour-like SUVs\u201d don\u2019t belong in cities. Oliver Krischer, a deputy leader of the Green party in the German parliament, called for size restrictions on 4x4s allowed into urban centres. \u201cThe best solution would be a nationwide rule that allowed local authorities to set size limits,\u201d he told Der Tagesspiegel.\n\nSUVs are a paradox: while many people buy them to feel safer, they are statistically less safe than regular cars, both for those inside and those outside the vehicle. A person is 11% more likely to die in a crash inside an SUV than a regular saloon. Studies show they lull drivers into a false sense of security, encouraging them to take greater risks. Their height makes them twice as likely to roll in crashes and twice as likely to kill pedestrians by inflicting greater upper body and head injuries, as opposed to lower limb injuries people have a greater chance of surviving. Originally modelled from trucks, they are often exempt from the kinds of safety standards applied to passenger vehicles, including bonnet height. In Europe legislation is being brought in to end such \u201coutdated and unjustified\u201d exemptions.\n\nIn Germany the Berlin crash was only the start of protests. After the fatal collision, Greenpeace blocked a shipment of SUVs in Bremerhaven for several hours.\n\nIn Frankfurt the following weekend between 15,000 and 25,000 people gathered in a protest months in the planning, at the launch of the biannual Frankfurt Motor Show, where German auto manufacturers promoted their SUVs alongside smaller and cleaner electric vehicles. As Chancellor Angela Merkel toured the stands activists climbed atop SUVs holding banners that read \u201cKlimakiller\u201d (climate killers).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Activists, including one wearing a Angela Merkel mask, outside the Frankfurt Motor Show, holding signs reading \u2018gas guzzling vehicles off the road\u2019 and \u2018Stop petrol and diesel\u2019.

They are forecast to reach nearly 40% by 2021. While pedestrian deaths are falling across Europe, they are not falling as fast as deaths of those using other modes of transport.\n\nIf you\u2019re hit by a large engine car you\u2019re almost twice as likely to be killed Adam Reynolds\n\nAlthough EU-wide figures don\u2019t break down the type of car involved in collisions, in the US the link is clearer. \u201cPedestrian crashes have become both deadlier and more frequent,\u201d says the US Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). \u201cThe increase has been mostly in urban or suburban areas, away from intersections, on busy main roads and in the dark. Crashes are increasingly likely to involve SUVs and high-horsepower vehicles.\u201d\n\nLast year was the deadliest for US pedestrians since 1990, with 6,000 deaths nationwide. The growth in SUV sales, which account for 63% of passenger vehicle sales, is partly to blame. Pedestrian crashes involving SUVs increased 81% between 2009 and 2016, according to the IIHS. A report by the Governors Highway Safety Association found that while pedestrian deaths in collisions with cars increased 30% from 2013 to 2017, those involving SUVs increased by 50%.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People mourn at the site of an accident in Berlin, in which four people were killed and three seriously injured when a SUV car crashed into a group of pedestrians.

The lack of collision data is \u201cmasking a deadly problem created by the car industry marketing and producing taller, heavier vehicles\u201d, he told Forbes.\n\n\u2018Climate killers\u2019\n\nTransport, primarily road transport, is responsible for 27% of Europe\u2019s carbon emissions. A decade ago the EU passed a law with a target to reduce carbon emissions to 95g/km by 2021 but a recent report by campaign organisation Transport and Environment highlights what is calls it \u201cpitiful progress\u201d. \u201cSixteen months from before the target comes into force carmakers are less than halfway towards their goals,\u201d the report adds . The car industry faces hefty fines in Europe of \u20ac34bn in a few months for failing to meet emissions targets.\n\nThe industry blames the market turning away from diesel, which is lower carbon than petrol, although more toxic. The Transport and Environment report places the blame firmly on the rise of SUVs, \u201cdriven by carmakers\u2019 aggressive marketing\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Greenpeace protesters outside the Frankfurt Motor Show.

Every 1% market shift toward SUVs increases CO2 emissions by 0.15g CO2/km on average. A 2018 Committee on Climate Change report noted that \u201cthe popularity of SUVs is cancelling out emissions savings from improvements in technology\u201d.\n\n'For me, this is paradise': life in the Spanish city that banned cars Read more\n\nJulia Poliscanova, director of clean vehicles and e-mobility at Transport and Environment, says regulators must step in to force car manufacturers to produce and sell zero-emission and suitably sized vehicles, for example small and light cars in urban areas.\n\n\u201cSmart urban policies are also key to drive consumers towards clean and safe modes,\u201d she adds. \u201cMayors should reduce space and parking spots for private cars and reallocate it to people and shared clean mobility services.\u201d\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "Statistically less safe than regular cars and with higher CO2 emissions, campaigners argue the heavily-marketed cars have no place in urban areas", "authors": ["Laura Laker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c1ebf61c3023286a3e1390bdd3a4a391faa1b77/0_235_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0ed8e043eaedee69c7921f9a7d64326e", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
