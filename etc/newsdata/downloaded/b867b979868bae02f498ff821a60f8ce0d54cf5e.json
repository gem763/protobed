REUTERS/Christian Hartmann\n\nPatou\u2019s office, a typical Haussmannian apartment a stone\u2019s throw from Notre-Dame Cathedral, was turned into a showroom where clients and journalists got a glimpse of the brand\u2019s first fashion collection since it closed its doors in 1987.\n\nInstead of a catwalk, models stood around, artificially idle as they chatted or read books, showcasing dresses with lace trimmings, Navy-style officer jackets and wide denim jeans.\n\nAccessories included oversized handmade golden jewels, as well as tight-fitting bathing caps and black boxing boots which evoked the sportswear style of the Patou of old, which once dressed tennis player Suzanne Lenglen.\n\nOther looks included a pale pink fencer\u2019s jacket, a fuschia strapless puffball dress, and plenty of sailor-style necklines and bows and navy blue structured jackets.\n\nHenry described the laid-back but chic vibe of the collection as \u201csunny.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Patou woman is an approachable woman,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nLuxury goods group LVMH, which also owns Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton, bought its majority stake in Jean Patou last year from privately held British group Designer Parfums for an undisclosed amount.\n\nIt tasked Henry, who previously worked at Carven and Nina Ricci, with breathing new life into its forgotten pret-a-porter lines, which the late Karl Lagerfeld as well as designers Jean Paul Gaultier and Christian Lacroix once worked on.\n\nPatou, created in 1914 by its eponymous founder, was still best known for its rich floral perfume \u201cJoy,\u201d launched in the 1930s and the most expensive fragrance of its time.\n\nLVMH\u2019s Dior recently launched its own \u201cJoy\u201d fragrance.\n\n\u201cA year ago, Patou was a project without an address, without archives, without material, without anything,\u201d Henry said. \u201cIt was necessary to set up a company, a century-old company.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know Patou so we don\u2019t want to bring back a brand with its patrimonial or historical background but to see it with a new perspective.\u201d\n\nPatou is targeting a wide audience, with prices in the bottom bracket of the luxury world with dresses varying between 450 euros ($492) and 5,000 euros for the most expensive. On average, a dress costs 650 euros.", "description": "French couture house Patou came back to life on Wednesday under the helm of LVMH, its new parent company, and designer Guillaume Henry, who gave a modern, chic twist to its historical designs at a Paris Fashion Week presentation.", "authors": ["Laetitia", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433903719&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O24S-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
