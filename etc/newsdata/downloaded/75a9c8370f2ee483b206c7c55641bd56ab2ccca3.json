Insurance company Hagerty values a daily-driver condition 1970 Dodge Charger 500 with a 318 V8 at US$27,000 on average.\n\nTo the dismay of Mopar enthusiasts everywhere, the owner followed up on his threat and had the car crushed at a wrecking yard while a friend filmed it. \u201cBeautiful! That\u2019s what you guys f**kin\u2019 get!\u201d the cameraman can be heard shouting as the forks of the tractor first come down on top of the Charger\u2019s roof. \u201cEverybody wants to be a car guy until it\u2019s time to do car guy shit!\u201d\n\nAs TireMeetsRoad.com notes, in the video, the engine can be seen still in the car, suggesting the owner hadn\u2019t really attempted parting out the Charger. It\u2019s not certain if the car still ran or not.\n\nThe reaction on Facebook was mostly one of disgust over someone putting to waste a classic car \u2013 or, at the very least, a classic set of fenders, glass, and other good parts \u2013 because they were obstinate about getting their asking price. However, many also defended the owner\u2019s actions, saying he is free to do with his property as he sees fit.\n\nAt the end of the video, the owner dispels any speculation about his motives for crushing the Dodge Charger. He insists he doesn\u2019t use drugs, and is not doing it for money\u2014it\u2019s strictly to send a message.\n\nHe even seems to revel in the car\u2019s destruction as the tractor\u2019s forks pierce through the sheet metal: \u201cI\u2019m gonna sleep good tonight!\u201d", "description": "\"Don't bother the seller if you ain't buyin'!\" the owner shouts in a video of his '70 muscle car being destroyed", "authors": ["Hours Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/1970-dodge-charger-crushed-mopar-rapid-transit-copy.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
