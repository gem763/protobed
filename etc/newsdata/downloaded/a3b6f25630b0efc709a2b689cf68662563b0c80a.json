Her vision, and the work of a huge team of public servants, led to what arose from the ashes: a new use for a site forever marked by tragedy.\n\nToday, at the very spot where the plane piloted by terrorists crashed into the Pentagon, there is a chapel. Eighteen years after the mass murder of 184 people here, U.S. military employees of every faith gather daily to pray.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of emotion built into that effort,\u201d Ezzat said this year, as she contemplated the anniversary of a day she still can\u2019t fully comprehend. \u201cWe just wanted to make it a peaceful place that could help wipe away the tragedy.\u201d\n\n['When people hurt, I know hurt': National Airport's chaplain mourns his 10-year-old son]\n\nEzzat, an Army Corps of Engineers employee who was project manager for the Army\u2019s space in the Pentagon at the time of the attack, knew right away when she and her co-workers were charged with designing the reconstruction that she didn\u2019t want to make that segment of the Pentagon into office space again. No one would want his or her office there, she reasoned. Instead, she searched for a meaningful new purpose.\n\nWhat emerged was a quiet sanctuary with cushioned blue seats and prayer books from several denominations. Stained glass windows pay tribute to those who died here: \u201cUnited in Memory, September 11, 2001.\u201d Anyone who wishes can walk next door to a memorial, where every victim\u2019s name is written on the wall, and their life stories, as written by their loved ones, are told in two thick books. Pentagon employees who just want to visit the chapel without stopping at the memorial can enter through alternate doors.\n\n\n\nJim Mattis, then the defense secretary, visits the Pentagon Memorial Chapel in 2017. (U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Jette Carr/Office of the Secretary of Defense Public Affairs)\n\nA schedule posted on the wall shows Episcopal and Lutheran services every Wednesday, Hindu services and Jewish study sessions every Thursday, Greek Orthodox services every Friday, Buddhist prayers twice a month, and more.\n\nThe chapel\u2019s most frequent users, according to chaplain Monica R. Lawson, are the Catholics who attend daily Mass there and the Muslims among the Pentagon\u2019s massive workforce of 26,000 people. Some Muslims who pray five times a day, as is traditional, visit the chapel when they need a private space to pray. As a group, Muslims pray daily in midafternoon in the chapel and host a service with a sermon every Friday.\n\n[The exasperating quest to get 10 men together to pray in an airport]\n\nFor Ezzat \u2014 who is Muslim and who was bothered by those who blamed her entire religion because the terrorists who attacked the Pentagon were Muslim extremists \u2014 seeing Muslims who are devoted U.S. military employees at prayer in the chapel is fulfilling.\n\n\u201cOn a personal level, I heard things, negative things. \u2026 You\u2019d hear it in the hallways and the corridors. \u2018Oh, those idiots did this and did that.\u2019 It hurt me,\u201d she said. She wanted to argue \u2014 to say that the terrorists were a few horrible people, not representatives of her religion. But she brushed it off. \u201cI\u2019d hear it and get upset over it, and a minute later, I\u2019m done with it,\u201d she said.\n\nQawiy Abdullah Sabree, a cybersecurity expert who has been a civilian employee at the Pentagon for 27 years, goes to the chapel every day, sometimes twice on Fridays. He often finds himself bowing to say Muslim prayers alongside co-workers who might be reading from a Christian prayer book, standing for Jewish davening or sitting in quiet meditation.\n\n\u201cIt gives me that escape from the daily routine of work, to have a place to come and just reflect on your beliefs, reflect on the creator that gave us life. It\u2019s a very good thing to have,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Pentagon is a place for employment. \u2026 It\u2019s a privilege to have a place for prayer.\u201d\n\nSabree was just feet away from co-workers who were killed when the plane hit the Pentagon. Had he not stepped away to talk to another employee, he says, he would have died with them. \u201cIt\u2019s something you do not forget. And so you remember it and keep it from happening again, ever,\u201d he said. \u201cThat space where the chapel actually is, it\u2019s a reminder.\u201d\n\nLawson, who is an ordained elder in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and one of three full-time chaplains stationed at the Pentagon, said she sees this chapel as an exemplar of the American values that the terrorists couldn\u2019t destroy.\n\n\u201cEvery day that I come in here, I think about that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder of how privileged and honored we should be that we live in a country where we can worship here at work. The first day I started here, it hit me, the significance \u2014 where the chapel is located.\u201d\n\nWhile the other two Pentagon chaplains are both Protestants like Lawson, the staff chaplains work to recruit qualified leaders for services for all other faith groups that want to use the space. \u201cWe all say \u2018one nation under God,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cWhen you walk in and you see that, and people are respectful of one another\u2019s religion, it\u2019s a blessing.\u201d\n\nEzzat said she appreciates that her team created a prayer space where Muslims who devote their careers to America\u2019s security can worship, in the very space where extremists attacked. \u201cThe faithful prayers which take place in this space, whether it\u2019s Jewish prayer, Islamic prayer, Christian prayer, I think it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Islam, we believe prayers \u2014 supplications \u2014 to the dead reach them, wherever they are.\u201d\n\nThe rush to rebuild the Pentagon was all-consuming. The young service members who give tours of the Pentagon to visitors still brag about it \u2014 how the construction team was told to rebuild in three years, and managed to do it in less than one. How they worked almost 24/7 to do it, and then donated all that overtime pay, about $3 million, to pay for this chapel and memorial and to support victims\u2019 families.\n\nAt the end of that year, Ezzat was exhausted, and overwhelmed from grieving for the co-workers she lost. \u201cWhen I worked at the Pentagon, I just felt I was with my second family. \u2026 It just destroyed me,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed to get out of here. The building brought back a lot of bad memories. I just couldn\u2019t stay.\u201d\n\nEzzat received a doctorate in structural engineering and then worked in private practice before joining the Army Corps of Engineers. Her first role in the Corps was working on the renovation of the Pentagon, a years-long project that was underway when the 2001 attack took place.\n\nEzzat says her earlier work reinforcing the exterior of the building, a costly project she had fought to get approved, saved lives when the terrorists attacked. The floors above the crash site collapsed more than 20 minutes after the initial impact, enough time for everyone there \u2014 Ezzat says it was 1,500 people \u2014 to walk out alive.\n\n\n\nToday, Ezzat oversees construction of military schools around the world. (Courtesy of Manal Ezzat)\n\nWhen the reconstruction that included the chapel was done in 2002, she requested a transfer out of the Pentagon, and got it.\n\nWhen she herself prays, five times a day, she prays alone.\n\nToday, she is the program manager for Defense Department schools, which educate military members\u2019 children around the world. Ezzat, who came to the United States from Egypt as a young child, says she can\u2019t imagine a job she would want more than supporting the service members who defend American ideals.\n\nWith almost 25 years in the Corps under her belt and a new grandchild drawing her attention, she is starting to think about retirement.\n\nShe remains proud of what she built out of tragedy 18 years ago, the time she created a religious haven out of wreckage. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the healing process,\u201d she said.", "description": "Manal Ezzat fled the wreckage of the Pentagon \u2014 then went back to work to transform it.", "authors": ["Julie Zauzmer", "Reporter Covering Religion", "Faith", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/z4J2HYNOwZhnuZlt1DJ142ugTe8=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-10-2019/t_4a48c02d35fc4f6dbbc04d36339de9c5_name_Screen_Shot_2019_09_10_at_9_34_00_AM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
