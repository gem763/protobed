The former model and early adopter of blogging and social media launched her eponymous label seven years ago, fusing those elements of her background to create a line of clothes that combine Scandinavian restraint with LA rock\u2019n\u2019roll vibes: perfectly fitted white tees with louche leather pants, checked blazers over vintage-looking tees with denim.\n\nNow, she is opening her 14th store \u2013 and the first in Australia \u2013 in Sydney\u2019s Paddington.\n\n\u201cAustralian customers have been very vocal about opening a store here,\u201d says Bing, who is the brand\u2019s chief creative officer. \u201cWe\u2019ve had so many requests to open here \u2013 via social media and through customers who travel to our American and European stores. It was a natural fit.\u201d\n\nTimeless style with a rock 'n' roll edge, is how the brand describes its feel. Supplied\n\nAustralian style, says Bing, has many parallels to those of Scandinavia and Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s very relaxed, with a touch of rock. Our aesthetic works very well here.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, adds chief operating officer Annika Meller: \u201cAustralian women have embraced Anine Bing since the very beginning. Since launch, Australia has been a top five market for us via e-commerce.\u201d\n\nOpening a brick-and-mortar store, too, is an opportunity for Bing and Meller to understand the Australian consumer better. The brand began as a direct-to-consumer line and used social media such as Instagram to act as word of mouth, but Bing quickly saw the value in opening stores, despite the high costs.\n\nI want to make things easy for women on the go. \u2014 Anine Bing\n\n\u201cIt happened very organically,\u201d she says. \u201cEarly on women wanted to come into our showroom, to touch the clothes, feel them, try them on. So we realised from the beginning there was space to open a store.\u201d\n\nTwo years after launch, the brand opened its first store, in Los Angeles, followed by New York and then Paris. There are now 14 stores worldwide, with five alone opening this year.", "description": "After amassing an fan base Down Under via e-commerce, the Los Angeles-based designer is opening a store in Sydney.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2878%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_185/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/22f7fd3c02ad90268f2241d09b27cab6ff8eb5b0", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
