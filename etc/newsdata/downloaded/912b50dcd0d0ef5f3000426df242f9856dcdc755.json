Republican senators who usually stand in lock step with Trump said the move amounted to abandoning Syrian Kurdish fighters who had fought ISIS alongside American troops.\n\nTrump signaled Monday he was listening to the criticism. \"I told Turkey if they do anything that is not humane, Turkey will suffer a very decimated economy,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"If Turkey does anything that they are not supposed to do, we will hit them so hard in their economy.\u201d\n\nAs Turkey pushed forward with their operation Wednesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who is normally a staunch supporter of Trump, blasted Trump again. \u201cPray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration,\u201d Graham tweeted Wednesday. \u201cThis move ensures the reemergence of ISIS.\u201d\n\nTrump said in his statement Wednesday that Turkey had \u201ccommitted to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place.\u201d The president added that the United States would \u201chold them to this commitment.\u201d He did not specify how the administration would do so, although he has in recent days floated the prospect of economic punishment.\n\nTrump also warned in a tweet Monday that, \"if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey.\" He did not specify what would qualify as \"off limits.\"\n\nAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!).
