But will it make them stronger? | Jonathan Freedland", "language": "en", "text": "Since 2016, Britain and the United States have grappled with a shared fate, facing down the conjoined twins of populism: Brexit and Trump. This week, at long last, came the first signs of a reckoning. After three years in which the winners of 2016 have mocked, pushed or trampled on the constitutional constraints that sustain a liberal democracy, the constitutions \u2013 on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 struck back.\n\nThe mechanisms are different of course, but the convergence of these two connected stories has been uncanny all the same. The 11 judges of the UK supreme court cancelled Boris Johnson\u2019s unlawful suspension of parliament on the very day the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, put aside her previous misgivings and launched an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump.\n\nPelosi closed her announcement with a declaration that could serve as a precis of the judgment read out that morning by supreme court president, Lady Hale: \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d\n\nRight now impeachment looks doomed to fail\n\nAs if to reinforce the point, in a touch which seemed almost too on-the-nose, that same day also saw Boris Johnson and Trump appear side by side at the UN in New York \u2013 Trump joking that a ruling by Britain\u2019s highest court that the prime minister had acted illegally was \u201cjust another day in the office\u201d. Smiling and joshing, they looked like partners in crime.\n\nThe similarities between these two convulsions, separated by an ocean, range from the trivial to the grave. In the first category, how odd that in both countries the anointed tribune for anti-elite rage and channel for pent-up, nativist fury is a wealthy child of privilege once inseparably associated with the ultra-liberal metropolis. Johnson was the mayor of London who backed an amnesty for undocumented immigrants, Trump the Manhattan socialite who supported abortion rights and gun control. Yet both now pose as champions of the forgotten heartlands against the liberal establishment.\n\nIn the second, more serious category, hovering over the turmoil in both Britain and the US has been the threat of violence. During the 2016 EU referendum campaign, MP Jo Cox was murdered; a few weeks later, Trump hinted that gun owners might deal with Hillary Clinton by taking the law into their own hands.\n\nThis week, the Commons gasped as Johnson dismissed as \u201chumbug\u201d a pained plea to learn the lesson of Cox\u2019s murder and drop the inflammatory talk of \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d, language that has been adopted in the death threats that have rained down on so many MPs, women especially. In New York, Trump greeted the testimony of an unnamed whistleblower \u2013 who had revealed that the president had pressed the leader of Ukraine, needy for financial aid, to \u201cdo us a favour\u201d and dig for dirt on a political rival \u2013 with a barely veiled threat of his own: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:43 Outrage as Boris Johnson dismisses dangers of inflammatory language as 'humbug' - video\n\nWhat connects these two battles most, however, is that they are framed the same way. Both the Brexiters and Trump insist they are locked in a titanic struggle between \u201cthe people\u201d \u2013 with \u201cBoris\u201d or Trump as their champions \u2013 and the hated elite, comprised of anyone who might thwart their will: judges, journalists or even elected representatives. This leads in turn to the dilemma that has confronted those who would oppose Brexit or Trump. Is it wise to mount a challenge when that very challenge will confirm and strengthen the frame that Trump or the Brexiters have constructed? Put another way, is it wise to fight a populist when a fight is exactly what they want?\n\nIn Britain, the dilemma was visible during that ugly Wednesday night in the Commons. Those MPs speaking of their alarm at the increasingly incendiary rhetoric of the Brexit debate had their anxiety etched on their faces. But Johnson was untroubled, insouciant throughout. That might have been because a debate about language provides a handy distraction from the week\u2019s central fact, the supreme court ruling, allowing him to wave aside that verdict as if it were a mere opinion with which he disagreed. (That\u2019s not how the law works. It is not a court\u2019s opinion that Peter Sutcliffe was a murderer; it is a fact.)\n\nBut might it not also have been because Johnson welcomes the outrage of a few teary MPs and their defenders on Twitter? After all, that\u2019s apparently been the Johnson strategy since the start: keep on acting appallingly, keep goading the remainers, keep inviting them to denounce and block you all the way to an election that you can fight as \u201cthe people v the elite\u201d. A debate about whether it\u2019s appropriate to brand a law preventing a no-deal Brexit as \u201cthe surrender act\u201d works well for Johnson, just as the row over the bogus \u00a3350m did in 2016, not least because it ensures the idea gets repeated on the airwaves ad nauseam: surrender, surrender, surrender.\n\nIn the US, Pelosi was reluctant to move to impeachment because she feared it would give Trump the fight he relished. There they go again, he\u2019d say, Democrats and their friends in the \u201cfake news media\u201d using tricks to remove a president that you, the people, elected fair and square. He could play the victim, howling about witch-hunts and \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d, tapping into the deep sense of grievance that animates his base. The circus of televised hearings would provide precisely the polarised chaos in which he thrives.\n\nThere are plenty of other good reasons not to go ahead. Right now impeachment looks doomed to fail: it requires the votes of 67 senators to remove a president from office, which means the defection of 20 Republicans. The liberal Republican wing whose desertion spelled the end for Richard Nixon is all but vanished now: the 21 brave Tories who broke from Johnson have few counterparts on Capitol Hill. The notion of US public opinion shifting en masse against Trump is a stretch, too. US media consumption is now so partisan that Trump\u2019s base will only ever hear a story that exonerates him from guilt.\n\nPlay Video 1:17 Nancy Pelosi accuses Trump of 'betrayal' as she announces impeachment inquiry \u2013 video\n\nThe truth of Watergate was near-universally accepted in 1974; it\u2019s hard to imagine anything being universally accepted now. What\u2019s more, impeachment will consume Democratic energies, distracting them from their ongoing primary contest. When Democrats should be talking to US voters about healthcare, jobs and the climate crisis, they\u2019ll be talking instead about Ukraine, transcripts and secret servers.\n\nAnd yet they have no real choice. The politics of it may be fraught with risk, but it is their duty. The already known facts of the Ukraine episode establish a clear abuse of presidential power: Trump used the might of his office to advance not the country\u2019s interest but his own. Nor can you argue that the remedy for such behaviour is an (upcoming) election, because Trump\u2019s abuse was aimed at subverting that very election.\n\nTory MPs beware: if you whip up an angry mob, they may end up angry with you Read more\n\nDemocrats face the same logic that confronted Johnson\u2019s opponents.\n\nPerhaps, politically, it would have played better not to have a wealthy Londoner such as Gina Miller sue the government. Maybe it did look bad having 11 judges strike down the Brexiters\u2019 champion, thereby confirming every Brexiters\u2019 suspicion about the \u201cremain elite\u201d. But the alternative was to let Johnson\u2019s suspension stand, so that a future prime minister could sweep aside an inconvenient parliament, and its irritating scrutiny, whenever they chose and for however long they liked.\n\nPerhaps impeachment will hand Trump a reality TV showdown he\u2019ll love. But the alternative was to say that when Trump told a group of teenagers in July that \u201cI have the right to do whatever I want as president\u201d, he was right. If Democrats met this abuse with a shrug, it would become the new normal. In Britain and America, the lesson is clear. Fighting populists might be like wrestling with a pig \u2013 you both get dirty, but the pig likes it \u2013 and yet it has to be done. The alternative is to see our democratic way of life snuffed out while we watch and wait and do nothing.\n\n\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Though the impeachment announcement and supreme court judgment are welcome, there are dangers ahead, says Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland", "authors": ["Jonathan Freedland"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3073cf6e003f9d9b55ae719765ecf09aac8fc4b/0_78_2334_1400/master/2334.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6f7a59ed11e1efe937bae30dd74b1159", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
