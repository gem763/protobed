Fifty-two much longer. But that\u2019s how far I go back as a Bullets fan. More than five decades! That may very well qualify me as the most ardent fan in the DMV.\n\nCheering for the old greats such as Wes, Murph, The Pearl and Honeycomb shaped my formative years. And following the squad that won a championship with The Big E, Bobby D, Grevey and Phil was one of the greatest thrills of my young life.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut clearly nothing could top that day in 1997 when my broadcast career took a whirlwind turn. That\u2019s when I landed the job as the Bullets\u2019 TV play-by-play announcer on Home Team Sports. Can you imagine?\n\nFor the next 22 years, I had perhaps the greatest sports job in local TV: calling games for the team I grew up rooting for. Ask 100 sportscasters what they\u2019d really like to do, and 99 of them will tell you play-by-play.\n\nBut to do it on the very highest level, with the world\u2019s most gifted athletes, in my own hometown, not to mention partnering with a guy I revered as a player, well, I often had to pinch myself.\n\nSpeaking of Phil Chenier \u2014 every time we traveled to New Orleans, they pronounced his name \u201cShen-YAY\u201d \u2014 our first face-to-face meeting was a memorable one.\n\nAD\n\nI was refereeing in the D.C. Urban Coalition Summer League and Phil was playing on a team made up of Bullets stars. Clearly, he must not have thought much of my officiating, and on one particular play called me a \u201cstupid [expletive].\u201d I was stunned. After all, he was an idol. So I did nothing \u2026 until he called me a \u201cstupid [expletive]\u201d again! So I hit him with a technical! Now I was really crushed, having to nail one of my favorite players with a \u201cT.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWho would have ever imagined, some 20 years later, we would be partners and eventually very close friends?\n\nI was truly privileged to travel with the squad, see sights you would not have imagined, broadcast from every arena in the U.S. (and Canada), stand on the floor next to some of the greatest players of all time, and even get to hang out with MJ!\n\nAD\n\nThrough good times and bad, there were loads of memorable moments. Gilbert\u2019s record-setting 60 in L.A. and his buzzer-beating game-winner vs. the Bulls in Chicago.\n\nWall, Beal and Nene with remarkable postseason performances. And there I was, courtside, blessed to be sitting there bellowing out the action.\n\nBut they say nothing lasts forever, change is inevitable, and sadly my time has come. I still don\u2019t know why the change was made, but the powers that be have the right to do so. Just know that Phil and I worked very hard to make every game matter, even in the years when they didn\u2019t. And while I never got the chance to show my appreciation, I do so now in this space.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA simple \u201cthank you\u201d doesn\u2019t do justice to the amazing opportunity given to me by longtime owners Abe and Irene Pollin, Susan O\u2019Malley and Jody Shapiro of HTS, along with Jim Cuddihy and Rebecca Schulte. And the support of Ted and Zach Leonsis.\n\nBut the greatest gratitude clearly goes to you, the fans, who have been along for the ride through Super Bowl-winning years at WTTG and 22 seasons through thick and thin with the Bullets and Wizards.\n\nDuring that time, I\u2019ve tried to call games with you in mind, from a fan\u2019s standpoint, as if we were watching the action together from your living room couch. Your support and kindness has made an indelible impact that I will carry with me forever.\n\nAD\n\nIt appears I\u2019ve called my last \u201cDAGGER\u201d for our boys, but you may hear it in the future, somehow, somewhere. So for now, THANK YOU for ALL the well wishes. They are genuinely appreciated!\n\nAD\n\nSteve Buckhantz\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cI\u2019ve tried to call games with you in mind, from a fan\u2019s standpoint,\u201d writes the team's play-by-play man for the past 22 years, \u201cas if we were watching the action together from your living room couch.\u201d", "authors": ["Steve Buckhantz"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rJM7hCGcJ58f9TkuKxgZxiaMTM0=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-03-2019/t_bffd822d3d1445329dff065c5dc00c4e_name_20191002_Buckhantz_Intv_Thumb_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
