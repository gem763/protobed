Custody is something that frightens him, he is honest about that.\u2019\n\nThe solicitor asked the court to consider a restriction of liberty order curfewing Findlater at his mother\u2019s home.\n\nSheriff Gregor Murray jailed Findlater for seven months and ordered him to sign the sex offenders\u2019 register for 10 years, adding: \u2018When I first sentenced you, I said these were horrendous offences.\n\n\u2018I said then that the choice was between what would be, because of the number of images, a relatively brief custodial sentence, or a lengthy community payback order.\n\n\u2018I think you understand a restriction of liberty order is nowhere near serious enough to deal with this, and in my mind there is no alternative to custody,\u2019 said the sheriff.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
