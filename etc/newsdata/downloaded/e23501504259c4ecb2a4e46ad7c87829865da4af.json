His crossing ability is well-known by now, but he is equally adept at picking out a corner of the net with ease too.\n\nHe proved that on Sunday afternoon, planting the ball into the top corner from a free kick just outside the box. And he was typically reliable throughout the game, covering ground up and down the right flank, doing his defensive duties well and causing problems, as ever, in attack.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

That is a daunting prospect for the rest of the division.\n\n2) Liverpool's set piece potency continues\n\nSince the start of last season, according to Opta, Liverpool have scored 34 goals from set pieces. That is seven more than any other side in the division. And it\u2019s hardly surprising, given the quality of delivery regularly put into the box by both Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Alexander-Arnold\u2019s opener was a stunning strike from the edge of the box, immaculately placed past Kepa into the top corner. And Robertson provided the dipping, curled ball into the box that was met by Roberto Firmino for the second.\n\nChelsea\u2019s defending was questionable, but Liverpool, as the statistics show, are difficult to stop from dead ball situations.\n\n3) Chelsea showing few signs of fixing defensive problems\n\nOnly Norwich and bottom of the league Watford have conceded more goals in the Premier League than Chelsea this season. That is hugely concerning for a team with aspirations of a top four finish.\n\nFrank Lampard\u2019s side have now let in 13 goals, and the manager does not appear to have an obvious solution to their defensive woes. It will not help that Andreas Christensen was forced off injured in the first half, replaced by the out of form Kurt Zouma.\n\nIt was far too easy for Liverpool to put balls into the box, and Chelsea looked particularly susceptible from set pieces. The second goal, headed in by an open Firmino, demonstrated the hosts\u2019 severe defensive deficiencies.\n\nGoal scoring has not been a problem for the Blues, but they will need to stem the flow at the other end, and soon, if they are to challenge at the top of the Premier League.\n\n4) Abraham not complete forward yet\n\nIt has, unquestionably, been an excellent start to the season for Tammy Abraham, making the step up from the Championship to the Premier League. He has scored seven goals already, including a ruthless, clinical hat-trick away at Wolves.\n\nAnd it would be easy to get carried away with such a start. It must be remembered that he is just 21-years-old, still inexperienced at this level and still in the process of improving his game. He will have off days, and this was one of them. He missed a fairly simple one-on-one in the first half and failed to convert a couple of half chances after the break.\n\nBut his positional awareness, his ability to sniff out chances remained impressive. And he was not completely nullified by Virgil van Dijk, as some suspected he might be. Abraham still has plenty of room to improve, then, but he should take heart from this performance.\n\n5) Chelsea show fight but still big gulf between top two and the rest\n\nChelsea were much improved in the second half, competing throughout and restricting Liverpool to relatively few chances. N\u2019Golo Kante\u2019s excellent goal gave the home side a route back into it and, to their credit, they pushed hard for an equaliser.\n\nBut it remains clear that there is a significant gap in quality between the newly established top two \u2013 Manchester City and Liverpool \u2013 and the rest. Chelsea, it seemed, had to work exceptionally hard to give themselves a chance of avoiding defeat.\n\nThis was not Liverpool at their free-flowing best. Chelsea might have rescued a point late on had they not squandered the chances they created. But victory at Stamford Bridge in such circumstances is testament to the level Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side are now at. The top two, six games in, are already breaking away from the pack.", "description": "1) Alexander-Arnold getting better and better If Trent Alexander-Arnold starts regularly adding goals to his game, he will be a truly formidable opponent.
