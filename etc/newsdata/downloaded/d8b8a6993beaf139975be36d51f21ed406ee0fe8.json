The ban, stipulated in the Future of Financial Advice reforms to the Corporations Act, was not applied retrospectively.\n\n\u201cThe Hayne Report found there was no justification for continuing to pay commissions to financial advisers. We agree,\u201d said Slater and Gordon special counsel Nathan Rapoport.\n\n\u201cPaying these commissions \u2013 and as a result charging members higher fees \u2013 ripped hundreds of millions of dollars out of members\u2019 retirement savings to profit the financial advisers or the licensees they worked for, who were not required to provide any services in exchange.\n\n\u201cWe allege that Colonial should have stopped paying the commissions for all its members and reduced their fees accordingly, as it properly did for new members.\u201d\n\nThis is the second class action Slater and Gordon has filed against CFS in the wake of the Hayne royal commission.
