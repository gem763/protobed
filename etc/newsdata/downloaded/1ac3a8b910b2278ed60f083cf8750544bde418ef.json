On the creative side, though, is a steady stream of solid compositions \u2014 some definitively old-school, others divinely new.\n\nAs always, a few quick notes on how I\u2019ve assembled this list: Craft is a bit more important to me than the stories themselves. I tend to put more stock into podcasts that function well as stand-alone experiences, though I\u2019m aware that puts comedy, conversational, and \u201caftershow\u201d series at a disadvantage. As always, more established shows have the added burden of being ranked against prior seasons (which is why, unfortunately, Leon Neyfakh\u2019s Fiasco won\u2019t make the list this time). Also, I\u2019m cognizant of the insanity that comes with pitting narrative, documentary, comedy, fiction, interview, and other podcast genres against each other.\n\nAnd of course, this list is definitive and all-encompassing and in no way is defined by the subjective limitations of myself, a human being with his own tastes and preferences. With that all out of the way, let\u2019s go.\n\nHeadlong: Running From Cops (Topic/Pineapple Street)\n\nWhen it comes to a pop-culture artifact as iconic and self-evidently ubiquitous as Cops, it can be easy to ask the most basic questions. How, exactly, does something as inherently bizarre as this \u2014 a reality TV program that packages footage of police officers doing their jobs as entertainment \u2014 come to be? How did it become so influential? What\u2019s real, and what isn\u2019t? And most importantly, what has it done to us? Rigorously reported and elegantly constructed, Dan Taberski\u2019s follow-up to Surviving Y2K is a scorcher of sociological examination. The six-part series takes listeners down the rabbit hole of the show\u2019s legacy, from its somewhat unremarkable origins all the way through to its morally murky rise. What you find on the other end, it seems, is a window straight into our modern dystopia.\n\nLost Notes, Season 2 (KCRW)\n\nExecutive produced by Jessica Hopper, the veteran Chicago-based music critic, KCRW\u2019s music documentary anthology series has assembled an utterly unforgettable collection of stories for its sophomore season. Among the highlights: \u201cTeenage Offenders,\u201d in which the founding member of a punk band, now a middle-aged father, reckons with the misogyny of his old lyrics; \u201cSonic Sculptor,\u201d a portrait of Suzanne Ciani, whose synth art is intimately embedded in the sound of the \u201980s; and \u201cTo Chan Marshall,\u201d which features the poet Hanif Abduraqqib performing a letter to Cat Power, whose album The Greatest may well have saved his life. As with many historically oriented documentaries, reexaminations of the past are abundant in the season. But under Hopper\u2019s guidance, it\u2019s never felt more raw.\n\nAgainst the Rules (Pushkin Industries)\n\nThis should have been abundantly obvious from his books, magazine features, and audiobook readings, but Michael Lewis is a gifted raconteur. Through the filter of his slight Louisianan drawl, his capacity for sketching characters and deconstructing systems takes on new life. When operating as audio documentarian, he\u2019s never been more accessible. Against the Rules is classic Lewisian material, with the focus trained on the degrading role of referees and institutions acting as referees in modern society, and how that process is affecting us. The actual production quality of the show isn\u2019t completely polished, but those bumps don\u2019t really get in the way of the narrative. If you like Lewis\u2019s stuff elsewhere, you definitely shouldn\u2019t miss Against the Rules.\n\nThe Big One (KPCC)\n\nThe Big One has a slightly oddball premise that\u2019s fascinating enough to be worth the price of admission. Produced by Southern California Public Radio (KPCC), this limited-run podcast endeavors to give listeners a sense of what to expect when the San Andreas fault line that lies beneath the city inevitably rips, and what they should be prepared to do. Half service journalism and half speculative fiction, it\u2019s an innovative piece of science journalism that pulls off the execution. It\u2019s also a pretty fun listen \u2026 or at least, as fun as an end-times survival guide can be.\n\n10 Things That Scare Me (WNYC)\n\nPodcasting was made for shows like this. The title basically tells you everything you need to know: Each bite-size episode, which usually runs between five and eight minutes, features a different person, often someone of note but occasionally a listener, discussing ten things that scare them. The fears range from the banal, like bugs, to the existential, like a loss of purpose. When strung together contiguously as a collection, these lists are sublime windows into the quiet horror that comes with being alive. 10 Things That Scare Me also features some wonderful, thoughtful sound design, bestowing an uncommon level of aesthetic polish to these recordings.\n\nThe Dropout (ABC)\n\nIs it just me, or has the summer of scams been going for a really long time? Like, I can\u2019t actually remember the last time we weren\u2019t living in a season so luxuriously filled with frauds. Anyway, folks who simply can\u2019t get enough of stories about scams \u2014 and, specifically, stories about Theranos, one of the preeminent poster children of scams \u2014 shouldn\u2019t miss ABC\u2019s The Dropout, which turned out to be a solid addition to the growing body of literature on the Silicon Valley-based debacle. The podcast doesn\u2019t quite have the depth of the John Carreyrou book Bad Blood, but what it does have instead, crucially, are raw audio recordings of the depositions from the lawsuits that were brought to the company. It\u2019s a sensational get, and they provide a unique, powerful window into the case \u2026 and the mercurial figure at the heart of the story, Elizabeth Holmes.\n\nThe Last Days of August (Audible Originals)\n\nIn this semi-sequel to The Butterfly Effect, Jon Ronson and Lina Misitzis\u2019s fascinating journey into the porn industry and how it\u2019s been disrupted by the internet, the focus is on the mystery of a specific tragedy: the suicide of the adult performer August Ames, initially thought to be the result of cyberbullying until a series of logistical inconsistencies call the causal link into the question. What starts off feeling like what could possibly be another rote exercise in true crime eventually, and elegantly, evolves into a portrait of loneliness. The Last Days of August isn\u2019t without its complications, but it\u2019s compelling, thoughtfully assembled, and genuinely moving.\n\nBundyville: Season 2 (Oregon Public Broadcasting and Longreads)\n\nBundyville, the journalist\u2019s Leah Sottile excellent documentary podcast on extremism in the American West, is less a linear investigation than it is a spine-chilling crawl down an insidious rabbit hole. On the other side is something that feels like a parallel world, one made up of a network of individuals, groups, and ideas associated with a growing undercurrent of political fundamentalism. (Broadly, that undercurrent has manifested itself as the so-called Patriot Movement.) Bundyville\u2019s first season dug into the Malheur standoff of January 2016; earlier this summer, the podcast returned with a sustained examination of the standoff\u2019s ideological effects, highlighting a social phenomenon \u2014 and a societal threat \u2014 that feels like it\u2019s getting more entrenched by the day.\n\n30 for 30 Podcasts: The Sterling Affairs (ESPN)\n\nIt was the classic definition of a scandal. In 2014, Donald Sterling, then the billionaire owner of the then-dysfunctional Los Angeles Clippers, was forced by the NBA to sell the team after audio recordings of him spewing racist comments were leaked to the media. (He was also fined millions of dollars and banned from the league for life.) Maybe you know about this story, maybe you don\u2019t, and even if you did, you\u2019d probably want to check out this fantastic audio-doc series by ESPN\u2019s Ramona Shelburne, which vividly unpacks the scandal to explore a tightly woven bundle of societal fault lines, from the poisonous core of extreme wealth to the racial power dynamics of professional sports to the bigger-than-the-sum-of-its-parts ripple effects of player empowerment.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\n\u2022 The Clearing, the new true-crime podcast from Pineapple Street and Gimlet, is a strong addition to the genre thanks to the depth of its reporting and the strength of its hook. It also positions itself as a critique on the genre, and on this front, it is particularly curious. Can you exhibit distance from genre conventions while utilizing them to some extent? It\u2019s a compelling conundrum, and it\u2019s another reason the show is worth checking out.\n\n\u2022 Fans of Avery Trufelman\u2019s Articles of Interest from last year would likely really enjoy Nice Try! Utopian, her series on failed experimental communities that comes from a collaboration with Curbed. Interestingly enough, it pairs well with Lauren Ober\u2019s Spectacular Failures, which is about failed experimental communities of another kind: companies and corporations.\n\n\u2022 The New York Times Magazine\u2019s 1619 Project, which memorializes the 400th anniversary of American slavery, has drawn long lines for its print copies. Its audio version, currently ongoing, is no slouch either.\n\n\u2022 John Cameron Mitchell\u2019s star-studded podcast musical, Anthem: Homunculus, is worth the price of admission for its ambition alone.\n\n\u2022 Walking, Jon Mooallem\u2019s absurdish audio podcast from his walks in the Pacific Northwest, remains one of my favorite finds this year.\n\n\u2022 For those who court the strange: I can\u2019t seem to get enough of Richard\u2019s Famous Foods, which is a surreal and somewhat unsettling \u201cquasi-journalistic\u201d podcast about food.\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s something really interesting going on with Have You Heard George\u2019s Podcast?, the podcast-distributed musical poetry project by the British spoken-word artist George Mpanga, a.k.a.
