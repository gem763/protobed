What do you do? Walk out in protest? Perform a citizens\u2019 arrest? Hide the potted plants?\n\nFor better or worse, comic Kelly Bachman found herself in exactly this situation on Wednesday when Weinstein, who is out on $1m bail ahead of his impending rape trial in January, shuffled into the Actors\u2019 Hour, a small \u201cspeakeasy\u201d on New York\u2019s Lower East Side. He installed himself at a table and was soon surrounded by a small entourage (described as \u201cyounger women and older men in suits\u201d). Bachman, who was up to perform, later confessed she\u2019d had nightmares about spotting Weinstein in her audience. But if this was some kind of audition-by-fire, she passed with flying colours.\n\nThe entire episode has been well documented, but to summarise, Bachman adjusted her set on the fly to incorporate the kind of attack lines most people would only have thought of 24 hours later. She began by acknowledging \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d, or rather \u201cthe Freddy Kreuger\u201d in the room. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we had to bring our own Mace and rape whistles to Actors\u2019 Hour y\u2019all,\u201d she jokes to the small room. Incredibly, there are boos (in male voices) and a heckler tells her to shut up. \u201cShut up? This kills at group therapy for rape survivors,\u201d Bachman responds, adding: \u201cI have been raped, surprisingly by no one in this room, but I never got to confront those guys so \u2026 uh \u2026 just a general \u2018fuck you\u2019 to whoever.\u201d\n\nDuring the interval, two of Bachman\u2019s colleagues, Zoe Stuckless and Amber Rollo, approached Weinstein\u2019s table and furiously condemned him. \u201cI\u2019m going to stand four feet from a fucking rapist and no one is going to say anything?\u201d said Stuckless. They were escorted from the premises.\n\nIn a later statement, Weinstein\u2019s publicist Juda Engelmayer made out that Weinstein had been unfairly treated when he was \u201cout with friends, enjoying the music and trying to find some solace in his life that has been turned upside down\u201d. She described the scene as \u201cdownright rude and an example of how due process today is being squashed by the public\u201d.\n\nPlay Video 0:27 Harvey Weinstein confronted by actor at New York event \u2013 video\n\nThat goes some way to answering the immediate question: what the hell was Weinstein thinking? Is he so devoid of shame and self-awareness that he did not consider the effect of his presence at an event filled with young, female performers? That would certainly fit the pattern, judging by the testimonies of the 80-plus women who have come forward to accuse Weinstein of ruining their lives and careers. Or was he somehow testing the waters of his current notoriety? This would seem to be a familiar phase of the #MeToo process now: witness disgraced comics Louis CK and Aziz Ansari, both of whom attempted onstage comebacks following their own admissions of sexual misconduct \u2013 comebacks that were widely judged to be premature.\n\nOne thing this episode sheds light on is how Weinstein and others might have got away with their (alleged) abuses for so long. When we talk of a \u201cculture of silence\u201d, this public appearance was an illustration of how persistent and pervasive it still is \u2013 exacerbated by basic human decency and politeness. Many at the Actors\u2019 Hour venue were reportedly stunned when Weinstein came in, not believing it was really him, but very few of them spoke out about it. Many involved in this incident came to Weinstein\u2019s defence, however: the audience members who booed Bachman and told her to shut up; the people sat with Weinstein, one of whom called Rollo a \u201ccunt\u201d when she told Weinstein he was a monster; Weinstein\u2019s publicist. A male standup also attempted to defuse Bachman\u2019s earlier gag by saying: \u201cI\u2019d like to address the elephant in the room. Who in this room produced Good Will Hunting? \u2018Cause that shit was great.\u201d If this was a drama school test, that\u2019d probably be a fail. Even Bachman herself later admitted she was under pressurenot to speak out, from herself and others, since her act was being recorded and she wanted a \u201cgood, evergreen tape\u201d of her new material to send out to people.\n\nThe venue have also had to defend their actions, or rather inactions. They claimed their goal was \u201cto ensure that all guests are treated equally\u201d. Unsustainable though the notion is considering the mountain of testimony against him, Weinstein is technically innocent until proven guilty. There is a \u201cdue process\u201d argument that he will get his reckoning in court. In the meantime, we can still question just how much an accused sex criminal\u2019s desire for \u201csolace\u201d should be accommodated above that of others. Some would argue free speech ultimately won the day, and if Weinstein was testing the waters, he certainly got his toes burnt.\n\nThere would also be a delectable irony if the careers of Bachman, Rollo and Stuckless got a boost from this episode. Bachman already says she has had a spike in Twitter followers. They could be the first women in showbiz to come out of an encounter with Weinstein better off than they went in. That would be a turning point of sorts. But perhaps this bizarre incident also illustrates how the structures that enable male abuses of power go deeper than most of us imagined, and they still will be there after Harvey Weinstein has been dealt with. Bringing the final-level baddie of #MeToo to justice does not mean it\u2019s game over.", "description": "Is Weinstein so devoid of self-awareness that he didn\u2019t suspect he\u2019d be called out at the Actor\u2019s Hour?
