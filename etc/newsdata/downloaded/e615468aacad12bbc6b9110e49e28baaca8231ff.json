Rights groups label his administration as one the world's most corrupt.\n\nA Reuters tally of official hammer prices, VAT and 15% commission, showed a total of 26.93 million francs.\n\nA 2011 Aston Martin One-77 Coupe, which Knight described as an \"absolute rocket ship\", went for 1.55 million francs.\n\n\"Proceeds are for charity,\" he said.\n\nA black 2015 Koenigsegg One-1 fetched 4.6 million francs.\n\nA Swiss bidder told Reuters that an agent for a collector in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, had bought several supercars.\n\nA gray armored 1998 Rolls Royce Silver Spur in need of repair - and described by Knight as \"perfect for someone who doesn't have any friends or has enemies\" - went for 86,250 francs.\n\nA 1956 Aston Martin Lagonda, owned by the late Claude Nobs, founder of the Montreux Jazz Festival, was among 50 other cars that found new owners.\n\nThe Rolling Stones, Petula Clark, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, David Bowie and Freddie Mercury rode in the vintage vehicle, the catalog said.\n\nThierry Amsallem, Nob's partner and heir, attended the sale and bought a white 2007 Bentley Azure Decapotable from Obiang's collection for 112,125 francs.\n\n\"It is like new, just 843 miles on it. We'll use it to drive around performers,\" Amsallem, chair of the Claude Nobs Foundation, told Reuters.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting and writing by Stephanie Nebehay; additional reporting by Denis Balibouse; editing by Susan Fenton)", "description": "A collection of 25 supercars seized from Equatorial Guinea's vice president as part of a Swiss money-laundering probe fetched nearly 27 million Swiss francs ($27 million) at an auction held by Bonhams on Sunday.  \"The top lot of the collection and rarest of all, one of only nine built and introduced", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZEvYz4lavlE60LpviLIobA--~B/aD0zMDM7dz00NDk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/e47dbf1ec1798974677541b76dc14a41", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
