I remember a young girl saying, while holding a snowball, that she didn't know snow was cold. At that moment I realised that what were they about to experience would be very difficult for them.\n\nNot least as the United Nations weather agency forecasts that temperatures in the next two weeks will drop to minus 20 degrees Celsius in Presevo, Serbia and minus 13 degrees on the Greek border with Macedonia. After weeks and weeks of weather more like springtime than winter, a weather forecast on my phone got me packing my gear. I headed to the Serbia-Macedonia border, as down there migrants have to walk 10km in rough terrain before they can board a train in Serbia.\n\nA migrant stands wrapped in a blanket as he waits for a train to depart to Croatia at train station in Presevo. My car dashboard showed minus 7 degrees when I reached the village of Miratovac. After completing paperwork with Serbian border police I started walking towards the Macedonian border. Snow was falling and I saw a first group crossing the border. Twenty people, all wrapped in grey UNCHR blankets walked slowly and in silence. The wind was so noisy that they weren't able to talk to each other.\n\nAnother group, bigger this time, arrived with lots of kids. Many of them were crying from the cold. I was speechless: these same kids months ago would have smiled and made fun of me, mimicking me holding a camera. Nobody was smiling now.\n\nLast year children made up a quarter of the one million migrants and refugees arriving across the Mediterranean in Europe, the U.N. children's agency UNICEF says. My hands were freezing despite wearing two pairs of gloves.", "description": "Since the beginning of the migrant crisis in about mid 2015, my colleagues and I asked ourselves the same question: what will happen when the winter comes?", "authors": ["Marko Djurica"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQxCb9PEcB8ckTgQrrFORrBHGBIUfgRLdFoc119JN2kYcGJ7DOgkFv7K1cqW1bPs8yzgQ5OBrXhuxAkqxxazecTWugUrOZqIBy8XrOOde9Oqo"}
