In the study, researchers looked at 11- and 12-month-old babies\u2019 vocalisations, gestures and gaze behaviours, and at how their caregivers responded to them. \u201cThese have never been looked at together in the same analysis before,\u201d said Dr Ed Donnellan, from the University of Sheffield, the lead author on the study.\n\nTo measure the interactions, the researchers videoed infants and caregivers at home, and asked them to play as usual. \u201cWe took those recordings back to the university and very meticulously coded what was happening. We looked out for every time the infant vocalised, or gestured, and we coded all the caregivers\u2019 responses,\u201d said Prof Michelle McGillion of the University of Warwick, a co-author of the work published in the journal Developmental Science and presented at the British Science festival.\n\nThe caregivers later filled out a questionnaire about whether their children could say certain words referring to animals, daily routines and food.\n\nThe scientists then used statistical models to find that the best predictor of vocabulary at 24 months was when infants were seen to use vocalisations while looking at their caregiver\u2019s face when they were about a year old. The benefits were even greater when these interactions were followed by responses from the caregiver.\n\nThe statistics showed that at 19 months, children had an average of about 100 words. Those who exhibited the beneficial interactive behaviour earlier in life were seen to have an average of about 30 extra words.\n\n\u201cWhat this tells us is that babies are trying to communicate before they have arrived at their first words. When they\u2019re doing this, they are giving caregivers an opportunity to communicate back, and when the caregivers do that, that\u2019s when word learning seems to be improved,\u201d said Donnellan.\n\n\u201cThe message of this paper is that it\u2019s a joint effort; noticing what your child is attending to and talking to them about it will support their language development,\u201d said McGillion. \u201cThe joy of this message is that that can happen in any context \u2026 across any part of your day. It\u2019s not something that requires special equipment or even lots of time. It can happen when you\u2019re doing the laundry, for example \u2013 when you\u2019re taking out the socks, you can talk about socks \u2026 in the park, in the car, at mealtimes, at bathtimes. This finding can be used in any context.\u201d\n\nMcGillion hopes this work might lead to further studies across more age ranges: \u201cThis is a developmental snapshot in the first year of life, but children are constantly growing and changing and so are their behaviours. [It would be interesting to] look at these sorts of behaviours again as children progress through the second year of life to see what\u2019s happening there.\u201d", "description": "Researchers looked at 12-month-olds\u2019 vocalisations, gestures and gazes, and at how caregivers responded", "authors": ["Anna Ploszajski", "Mi\u0107o Tatalovi\u0107", "George Monbiot"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8fcf5de27f7df7a7c46f9086db43bf67505ff9d/0_119_5109_3065/master/5109.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b9b6aaa4a9d73692dbd1d3ab03d466be", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
