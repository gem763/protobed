A string of high-profile stars this week have condemned UEFA\u2019s Three-Step Protocol, dismissing it as unworkable.\n\nIn theory it should see players approach the referee after the first instance of abuse with an announcement made to fans to stop.\n\n(Image: Adam Gerrard / Daily Mirror)\n\nAfter a second instance the match is suspended after a second announcement with the players sent to their dressing rooms for a specific period. After a third instance the match is abandoned.\n\nAgain, however, nobody at UEFA could explain why Croatian referee Ivan Bebek, the official on Monday night, did not show any leadership and walk the players off after the second instance.\n\nIt was symptomatic of the lack of leadership at UEFA. Now though, the spotlight will stay on them.", "description": "UEFA say little beyond soundbites and at their plush Swiss HQ no one has any answers when questioned about their pitiful record in combating racism", "authors": ["Darren Lewis", "Image", "Reuters", "Sportimage", "Pa", "Adam Gerrard", "Daily Mirror", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637780.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AGP_MDM_161019UEFA_011JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
