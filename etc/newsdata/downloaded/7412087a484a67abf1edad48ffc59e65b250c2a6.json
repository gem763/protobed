Some of the top picks include Our Planet, Life Story, Abstract, Oceans, and Blue Planet.\n\nThey also use YouTube as a source and while the parents do allocate a few times a week on using workbooks or worksheets, they don\u2019t spend more than 30 minutes to an hour on it.\n\nParents Taylor and Derek think American schools don\u2019t do justice to black history (Picture: MDWFeatures)\n\n\u2018We let the kids pretty much take charge; whatever they ask about or want to know about is what our lesson will be or what we plan for a future lesson,\u2019 said Taylor.\n\n\u2018We eventually want to school them around the world and travel to different countries and continents and learn about everything literally on the go.\n\n\u2018We want them to learn through real-life, there so many lessons that can\u2019t be taught in a classroom of thirty-eight.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s so much not taught in schools that we want our children to learn and I don\u2019t believe in standardised testing and all that hoopla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018What we do works really well for us and our children are so smart people are always amazed after having conversations with them. It\u2019s the best choice we\u2019ve made for our children.\u2019\n\nIt means Taylor and Derek have some control of the rich African American history they want their children to learn about.\n\nTaylor hopes to prepare her children for the real world as opposed to sitting in a classroom working off sheets of paper (Picture: MDWfeatures / Taylor Catron)\n\nTaylor added: \u2018Mostly what we find unappealing about traditional school is that it\u2019s all about standardised testing and regurgitating information.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re not there to learn you\u2019re there to recite information and get good test scores. Not to mention all the important things that they don\u2019t teach, like accurate historical events and African American culture and history\u2019\n\nTheir lessons are more active and field-based than the average class (Picture: MDWfeatures / Taylor Catron)\n\nWhile they are enjoying homeschooling, the parents do worry about their childrens\u2019 social lives. But for the most part, the kids have enough friends to see as Taylor and Derek ensure they are able to meet others their own age.\n\nThey also cite Finland as having one of the best education systems in the world without having lots of tests and classroom time.\n\nTaylor said: \u2018Children aren\u2019t meant to sit down and be still and quiet for six to eight hours a day. They are supposed to run around and touch things and ask a billion silly questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018To anyone who might criticise this style of education I say, just because we do things differently doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re wrong or not effectively educating our children.\u2019\n\nMORE: Single dad, 25, insists homeschooling three children \u2018is a joy\u2019 \u2013 but his day starts at 4.30am\n\nMORE: Girl banned from school dance for wearing jumpsuit instead of dress\n\nMORE: People are using #ShareBlackStories to celebrate Black History Month on Instagram\n\nMORE: If Black History Month does not include LGBT+ people, it is not Black history\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Their classes involve regular hikes in the city, visiting cultural places like the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Museum, Contemporary Arts Centre.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91406128_1571820322.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
