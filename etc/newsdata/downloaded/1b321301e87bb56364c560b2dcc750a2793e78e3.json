Photo: Vulture, Benjamin Rasmussen/Getty Images and Netflix\n\nWhen you\u2019re watching Unbelievable, it\u2019s hard not to wonder about the accuracy of the Netflix true-crime drama. Based on the story of a teenager whose rape was discounted by the male detectives investigating her case, the show also concentrates on the female detectives who, years later, connected her assault to a serial rapist they had caught. Though the series hews closely to a true story that may at times seem stranger than fiction, showrunner Susannah Grant decided early on to fictionalize the real-life sources because, she says, \u201cwe didn\u2019t think there was any value in the actual names being broadcast as widely as Netflix has the capacity to do.\u201d Nevertheless, it\u2019s natural to want to know more about the people on whom the characters are based. We used the 2015 Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning ProPublica/Marshall Project story (and its follow-up reporting) that inspired Unbelievable as a road map to make this character-by-character guide to the facts behind the Unbelievable fictionalizations.\n\nStacy Galbraith/Karen Duvall (Merritt Weaver)\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nAs with Merritt Weaver\u2019s compassionate detective, it was a fluke that Galbraith\u2019s police-officer husband, David \u2014 not the karaoke-singing \u201cMax the Knife\u201d \u2014 remembered that his Colorado department had seen a similar rape in which the attacker had made his victim shower and scrupulously cleaned her. Galbraith had admired her new partner, Edna Hendershot, from a distance ever since their paths crossed at a police briefing for a big drug bust Hendershot had taken part in. As for how she felt arresting O\u2019Leary after discovering the birthmark on his leg that her victim had remembered, Galbraith said, \u201cI wanted to see the look on his face. And for him to know that we figured you out.\u201d Galbraith is now a Colorado Bureau of Investigation agent.\n\nEdna Hendershot/Grace Rasmussen (Toni Collette)\n\nPhoto: Beth Dubber/Netflix\n\nToni Collette\u2019s intensity as Detective Grace Rasmussen doesn\u2019t line up with Edna Hendershot\u2019s reportedly easygoing demeanor. But like her fictional counterpart, the real officer was more seasoned than Galbraith, having investigated more than 100 rapes by the time the two partnered up. While Hendershot never suspected or chatted up an off-duty police officer in a bar to get his DNA, as Grace does in episode six, she did stay behind so Galbraith could arrest O\u2019Leary solo, as seen in episode seven. Hendershot is now a sergeant in the Westminster Police Department.\n\nMarie Adler (Kaitlyn Dever)\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nLike her fictional counterpart, played with heartbreaking vulnerability by Kaitlyn Dever, Adler was a product of the foster-care system and had been abused. Unlike her avatar, she left her Costco job handing out food samples days after her 2008 rape. After the Lynnwood, Washington, police coerced her recantation and charged her with a \u201cgross misdemeanor,\u201d Adler took a plea deal and paid a $500 fine.\n\nIn January 2011, rapist Marc O\u2019Leary was apprehended, and the head of the criminal-investigations division showed up at Adler\u2019s door to tell her that her photo had been found among his things. She requested and received a personal apology from lead detective Jeffrey Mason. In 2014, she sued and settled with the city for $150,000.\n\nNow a married mother of two who turns 29 this year, she\u2019s a long-haul trucker, driving an 18-wheeler cross-country. She recently watched the series, according to ProPublica reporter Ken Armstrong; with Adler\u2019s permission, he tweeted some of her thoughts about the show. Though she found it hard to watch, she said the series was \u201cexcellent\u201d and even encouraged both of her foster moms, with whom she\u2019s still in touch, to watch it.\n\nThe Other Survivors\n\nPhoto: Beth Dubber/Netflix\n\nWhile the other survivors of Marc O\u2019Leary\u2019s crimes have been anonymized in Unbelievable, their experiences also reflect the true stories that allowed the detectives to connect their cases. Like the real college student whose rape brought Galbraith to Hendershot\u2019s door, Danielle Macdonald\u2019s Amber Stevenson remembers important details: the rapist using a pink Sony camera that had been stolen from Hendershot\u2019s 59-year-old victim (Vanessa Bell Calloway\u2019s Sarah) and an egg-shaped birthmark on the attacker\u2019s calf. Jayne Taini\u2019s Doris Laird is based on the 65-year-old fraternity housemother whose teddy bear, like her fictional counterpart\u2019s, yielded some DNA. And while we don\u2019t know if she was really a Druid like Annaleigh Ashford\u2019s Lilly Darrow, a 46-year-old artist did distract O\u2019Leary long enough to escape by jumping out of her bedroom window, breaking several ribs and puncturing a lung in the process.\n\nPeggy Cunningham/Judith (Elizabeth Marvel)\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nThe parallels between Elizabeth Marvel\u2019s well-meaning foster mom Judith and Adler\u2019s real-life foster parent Peggy Cunningham are undeniable. Adler was 16 when she became Cunningham\u2019s first foster kid. As in the series, Cunningham and Marie\u2019s transitional housing case manager were with Marie when police arrived after the rape, and she later shared her doubts about it with them. In 2016, she told \u201cThis American Life\u201d that she regretted talking to the cops but still believed Marie \u201cneed[ed] to take responsibility\u201d for her actions. \u201cSome of the way that she was acting was part of the reason why it had the outcome that it did,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am not the only person that didn\u2019t believe her.\u201d\n\nShannon McQuery/Colleen (Bridget Everett)\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nBridget Everett\u2019s amiable Colleen is a stand-in for Adler\u2019s real-life foster mother Shannon McQuery. She and her husband took in the high-schooler for a short time when her previous foster family\u2019s plans to adopt her fell through. Because of Adler\u2019s calm demeanor, McQuery also had doubts about the rape and, as portrayed in episode one, was confounded when Adler wanted to replicate her bedding. Two months after Adler was charged with false reporting, McQuery told the police investigating a new, similar rape nearby about her case. They told her the Lynnwood case was closed. After O\u2019Leary was caught, McQuery apologized to Adler and later told \u201cThis American Life\u201d she was \u201cshocked\u201d that Adler was willing to forgive her for \u201csuch a huge thing.\u201d\n\nFBI Special Agent Jonny Grusing/Billy Taggart (Scott Lawrence)\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nLike Scott Lawrence\u2019s effective Fed, FBI special agent Jonny Grusing was a crucial part of the task force that aided the detectives\u2019 work. Grusing\u2019s search for similar rape cases turned up an old unsolved burglary (Lilly\u2019s story) with evidence \u2014 the honeycomb glove pattern, the Adidas shoe print, and the white Mazda pickup truck \u2014 that connected all the known rapes. The truck\u2019s license plate led to O\u2019Leary. Grusing was the only officer to interview the serial rapist, perhaps because, as Taggart says to Karen and Grace about Chris in episode eight, \u201cwomen make him uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nDetective Jeffrey Mason/Robert Parker (Eric Lange)\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nEric Lange\u2019s detached Detective Parker is a surrogate for Sergeant Jeffrey Mason, who spent the bulk of his career on patrol and in narcotics and had little rape-investigation experience when he became the lead on Adler\u2019s case. Years later, an external review characterized the police interrogations of her as \u201cbullying and coercive\u201d with \u201cminor inconsistencies\u201d in her statements misjudged and strong evidence ignored. Mason wasn\u2019t fired and now leads a narcotics task force. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t her job to try to convince me,\u201d he said in 2015. \u201cIn hindsight, it was my job to get to the bottom of it \u2014 and I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDetective Jerry Rittgarn/Pruitt (Bill Fagerbakke)\n\nPhoto: Beth Dubber/Netflix\n\nThe real-life counterpart of Bill Fagerbakke\u2019s hard-hearted Detective Pruitt, Jerry Rittgarn threatened Adler with jail if she failed a polygraph. Rittgard left the police force before O\u2019Leary\u2019s arrest, but the case review found that threatening her with imprisonment and the possible loss of her housing was \u201ccoercive, cruel, and unbelievably unprofessional.\u201d In the book-length follow-up to their original reporting, journalists T. Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong said Rittgarn had objected to his work being labeled as bullying and wanted money to talk to them.\n\nMichael O\u2019Leary/Curtis McCarthy (Aaron Staton)\n\nAs in the series, Michael O\u2019Leary was mistaken for his similar-looking older brother because the cops didn\u2019t know they lived together. Michael was tailed by members of Grusing\u2019s team to get his DNA. None of the evidence police collected linked him to his brother\u2019s rapes.\n\nMarc O\u2019Leary/Christopher McCarthy (Blake Ellis)\n\nPhoto: Beth Dubber/Netflix\n\nLike Blake Ellis\u2019s fictional fiend, Marc O\u2019Leary knew that police departments didn\u2019t talk to one another and that the Army had his DNA, so he meticulously cleaned his crime scenes and made his victims wash away any genetic material. He told police that he\u2019d fantasized about rape since he was a kid and that his assaults were a type of \u201crape theater\u201d inspired by the Star Wars scene in which Jabba the Hutt chains up Princess Leia. As Chris says in the finale, had Adler\u2019s case been better investigated, police would likely have caught the rapist sooner. O\u2019Leary was 33 when he was sentenced to 327 and a half years for the Colorado attacks and an additional 68 and a half years for the two Washington rapes, including Adler\u2019s. Some of his computer files remain encrypted. \u201cIt went to the FBI lab [in Quantico],\u201d Galbraith told 48 Hours in 2017. \u201cNobody can get into it. And I was told that probably no one ever will.\u201d", "description": "The Netflix true-crime series hews close to the reported facts of the case while lightly fictionalizing main players like Marie Adler, Karen Duvall, Grace Rasmussen, and Christopher McCarthy, who is based on real-life serial rapist Marc O\u2019Leary.", "authors": ["Lisa Liebman"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/20/20-unbelievable-real-life-actor-detective-stacy-galbraith-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
