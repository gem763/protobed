I became a shell of my former self.\u201d\n\nAfter allegedly complaining to top brass at the firm for months, Guerrero filed a report late Tuesday in San Jose, California, with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The report names DLA Piper, the $2.84-billion firm with lawyers in more than 40 countries that in 2010 famously represented Paul Ceglia\u2014the wood-pellet salesman who allegedly tried to defraud Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe complaint also names a senior partner at the firm\u2019s Silicon Valley office who, according to the complaint, recruited Guerrero. As part of his pitch, the partner allegedly told Guerrero that she was a \u201cstar\u201d and that he expected her to soon outpace him. He told her \u201cyou\u2019ll be my boss soon,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nGuerrero\u2019s EEOC filing alleges gender discrimination\u2014including quid pro quo and hostile-environment sexual harassment\u2014as well as retaliation.\n\n\u201cI went from working in Hong Kong as general counsel and the top female executive at a global tech company to being abused by [the partner],\u201d Guerrero wrote in her open letter issued Wednesday, in which she asked to be voluntarily released from mandatory arbitration. Her letter also claims that, outside of forced arbitration, she would be able to file civil claims against the partner for assault, battery, and sexual harassment.\n\nGuerrero\u2019s complaint alleges that the partner\u2019s behavior was \u201ccommon knowledge among employees, including other partners in the Palo Alto office\u201d who refused to remedy the situation. She names at least three other senior male partners who were aware of the allegations against the partner for months and \u201copted to marginalize what happened and horrifically\u2014did nothing.\u201d\n\nOne of those partners, the complaint states, \u201cbluntly told Ms. Guerrero that she was lying and that this was clearly a case of \u2018he said, she said\u2019\u201d and then \u201cfabricated a reason to remove Ms. Guerrero from a valued account just days after learning specific details about her claims regarding Mr. [the partner].\u201d\n\nIn a statement to The Daily Beast, the law firm said: \u201cWe are aware of these allegations by one of our partners and take them seriously. As soon as we were notified of the allegations, we took appropriate steps to investigate them. This process is ongoing and we continue to seek Ms. de Verneuil\u2019s cooperation in our investigation.\u201d\n\nShanghai, Brazil, Chicago, and Palo Alto\n\nThe partner \u201cregularly throws temper tantrums in and out of the office,\u201d involving yelling, cursing, and clenched fists, the complaint states.\n\nOnce on a trip to Shanghai, the partner asked Guerrero to come up to his hotel room to discuss business, drank several glasses of wine, and offered her a foot massage, the EEOC complaint alleges.\n\n\u201cBefore she knew what was happening, he had her lying down on the couch with his body next to her, physically hugging and groping her,\u201d according to the complaint. \u201cUpset and in shock, Ms. Guerrero told him \u2018no\u2019 and ran out of the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn panic and disbelief about what he had done, Ms. Guerrero stayed silent because she naively thought that [the partner] would stop future advances,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nThe following week, on a flight to Brazil, the partner bumped himself and Guerrero up to business class and revealed his feelings for her, the report claims.\n\nBefore the plane landed, Guerrero said she was crying in the bathroom.\n\nThat night, according to Guerrero, the partner told her that he upgraded his room at the hotel so that the two could work there more comfortably and that two male associates on the trip would not be joining them for dinner. At a \u201cromantic restaurant,\u201d without the other two male associates present, the partner \u201cattempted to tell her things about his personal life\u201d while she claims she tried to steer the conversation toward work, the complaint alleges\n\nGuerrero eventually \u201cbecame so upset at the predicament that she was in and [the partner]\u2019s obvious intent to relentlessly pursue her that she sobbed uncontrollably and they had to leave the restaurant,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cBack at the hotel, undeterred and seeing her in a vulnerable state, [the partner] insisted that she go to his room for a drink.\u201d\n\nThen, according to the complaint, he repeated the same routine as he had in Shanghai.\n\n\u201cTrapped, in distress, and aware of his temper, Ms. Guerrero believed the best way to protect herself was to allow his physical assault rather than fight back,\u201d the report alleges.\n\nThe alleged assaults \u201cdirectly impacted her performance and caused Ms. Guerrero to forfeit opportunities that she otherwise would not have missed,\u201d including opting out of at least four subsequent business trips with the partner in order to avoid further assault and harassment, according to the complaint.\n\nOn another trip, in Chicago, the partner told Guerrero he needed to \u201cwork with her in his room\u201d and again \u201cjumped on\u201d her, forcibly putting his hands on her neck while kissing her and playing with the zipper of his pants, according to the complaint.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait anymore. Look, the bed is right there, Let\u2019s have an affair,\u201d he allegedly said.\n\nGuerrero alleges that when she pushed him off, the partner asked, \u201cThen why did I even come to Chicago? I introduced you to the powerful partners already.\u201d\n\nIn November 2018 in Palo Alto, the partner threw a party at his home, during which he pushed \u201ca never-ending supply of alcohol into [Guerrero\u2019s] hands,\u201d the report alleges. When they were in the kitchen alone, he grabbed her by the waist and \u201ctried to kiss and rub against her,\u201d the report states.\n\nGuerrero \u201cscreamed, pushed him off her, and yelled for him to stop,\u201d according to the complaint. \u201cScared he would force himself on her, she begged and pleaded with [the partner] to stop.\u201d\n\nShe kept yelling \u201cLeave me alone!\u201d but the partner \u201cphysically tried to prevent Ms. Guerrero from leaving his house, including by grabbing her wrists to hold her back,\u201d the report alleges.\n\nThe next day, the partner allegedly told her he\u2019d spent the \u201centire night sobbing because of the way she had rejected and treated him.\u201d\n\n\u201cPetrified\u201d\n\nOver the course of 10 months, Guerrero was \u201crepeatedly forced to reject [his] advances, only to experience [the partner]\u2019s unlawful retaliation,\u201d the complaint claims. \u201cLess than a year after starting at DLA Piper, Ms. Guerrero\u2019s projected career path was in shatters.\u201d\n\nFor months, according to Guerrero\u2019s complaint, she was \u201cafraid to tell anyone\u201d about the partner\u2019s alleged conduct, which included \u201cmanipulative badgering and belittling,\u201d \u201coutbursts,\u201d \u201cshunning,\u201d and \u201cextreme and unwarranted jealousy,\u201d the report claims.\n\n\u201cI was petrified to believe what was happening to me, much less tell anyone,\u201d Guerrero wrote in her letter. \u201c[The partner] controls my work and my ability to advance. When I dared to tell him to stop, [he] would refuse to speak to me for weeks, threaten to take me off of client deals, and accuse me of underperformance.\u201d\n\nBut eventually, word got out that something was going on.\n\nThe partner told Guerrero that there were \u201crumors\u201d in the office of an affair between them and that Guerrero made male clients and other lawyers \u201cuncomfortable\u201d because of the way that she dressed and her \u201csexual appeal,\u201d according to the EEOC report.\n\nAfter one rejection, the partner allegedly \u201cthreatened her job, position, at the firm, and compensation, and told her that their working relationship would never be the same.\u201d\n\nBy June 2019, Guerrero was hospitalized for severe intestinal problems, and physicians referred her to therapists, gastrointestinal specialists, and a social worker, according to the complaint. Later that summer, after more alleged bullying from the partner, Guerrero landed back in urgent care after a panic attack and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\u201cI speak five languages,\u201d Guerrero wrote in her letter. \u201cI worked as a successful corporate lawyer for top global companies on Wall Street, and in Paris, Hong Kong, Beijing, Tanzania and India. I excelled and thrived, even in these male dominated spaces.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly after joining DLA Piper\u2019s Silicon Valley practice and being subjected to [the partner]\u2019s unlawful behavior, have I suffered such humiliation and harm simply because of my gender,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cNo female working at DLA Piper... should be forced to litigate claims involving sexual assault and battery or sexual harassment by male lawyers in secret,\u201d Guerrero wrote. \u201cFemale employees at DLA Piper deserve to know about what happened.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated to include DLA Piper\u2019s comment on the allegations.", "description": "Vanina Guerrero was hired at the multinational firm\u2019s Silicon Valley corporate practice in Sept. 2018.
