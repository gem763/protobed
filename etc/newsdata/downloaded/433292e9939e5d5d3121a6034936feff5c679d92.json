They said that 39 people were pronounced dead at the scene. The police said that \u201cearly indications\u201d suggest that one is thought to be a teenager.\n\nThe police believe the container was from Bulgaria and entered the country at Holyhead in North Wales.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have arrested the lorry driver in connection with the incident who remains in police custody as our enquiries continue,\u201d Chief Superintendent Andrew Mariner said in the statement. \u201cThis is a tragic incident where a large number of people have lost their lives. Our enquiries are ongoing to establish what has happened.\n\nAD\n\nHe added that the process of identifying the victims could take a long time.\n\nPriti Patel, Britain\u2019s home secretary, tweeted: \u201cShocked & saddened by this utterly tragic incident in Grays. Essex Police has arrested an individual and we must give them the space to conduct their investigations.\u201d\n\nEven though Essex police said the container was from Bulgaria, they did not specifically identify the victims as migrants on Wednesday morning.\n\nAD\n\nMost fatal incidents in which victims died inside shipping containers in recent years have involved migrants, however. In August 2015, 71 bodies were found on the A4 Highway in Austria, inside a hermetically sealed and locked freezer truck. Most victims were from Syria, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe discovery came at the peak of Europe\u2019s refugee influx and became one of its defining, tragic moments.\n\nAD\n\nResearch by German public television and the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper later revealed that Hungarian officials had tapped the traffickers\u2019 phones, but failed to intervene on time.\n\nFour human traffickers were jailed for life over their involvement in the 2015 incident this summer.\n\nNoack reported from Berlin.\n\nAD", "description": "The container is believed to have originated in Bulgaria and the driver of the truck has been arrested.", "authors": ["Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom", "Rick Noack", "Foreign Affairs Reporter Focusing On Europe", "International Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Im6R8UhnPu6_ADXzyPUn5PY85TQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P7EVL7WPMYI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
