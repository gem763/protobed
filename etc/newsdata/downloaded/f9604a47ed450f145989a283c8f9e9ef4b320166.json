Given that the bank's global headcount numbers around 238,000, the proposed cuts represent approximately 4% of its overall staff. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe plan is HSBC's most ambitious attempt to control costs in years, according to two people briefed on it cited by FT. These cuts would come on top of the elimination of 4,700 redundancies in the bank's business, which it recently announced amid \"an increasingly complex and challenging global environment\" characterized by low interest rates, trade issues, and Brexit uncertainties.\n\nThe bank's personnel strategy seems to be up in the air right now, particularly in Europe \u2014 an underperforming region for HSBC. In addition to cutting hundreds of jobs from its investment banking division, there are several vacant positions or unlisted jobs at the vice president level, which could suggest the firm is in a hiring freeze.\n\nAnd regarding Europe specifically, HSBC had announced earlier this year that it had plans to move as many as 1,000 jobs from its London office to Paris, citing Brexit concerns, but it seemingly paused those efforts and only ended up relocating less than 100 jobs. Europe may see the majority of the upcoming reductions, as it's one of HSBC's worst-performing regions, leading the bank to question why it has such a large staff in Europe when it is seeing double-digit returns in parts of Asia, per FT's sources.\n\nWith such significant cuts, HSBC will need to make sure clients see no interruption in service, and online banking tools could help. A 10,000-employee reduction in headcount has serious potential to impact HSBC's operations, and the bank will need to be sure that its downsizing doesn't affect the quality of its customer experience.\n\nOne way to do that is to invest in digital banking tools that can either help preclude the need for human staff or that can empower customers to handle banking needs on their own. For example, investing in interactive voice response (IVR) systems or chatbots can help scale back the amount of staff that has to be available for customer service functions.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
