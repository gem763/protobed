Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. | Zach Gibson/Getty Images Elections Ocasio-Cortez endorses Markey as Joe Kennedy eyes his Senate seat\n\nSen. Ed Markey on Friday got a major boost in the not-so-invisible primary between himself and Rep. Joe Kennedy, nabbing an endorsement from liberal firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who shot to fame after mounting an insurgent primary run against the then-No. 4 Democrat in the House last year, endorsed Markey in a video posted to his campaign account.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile Kennedy has not yet announced a primary challenge against Markey, he's considered one of the strongest potential rivals. Earlier this summer, he launched an exploratory committee and begun making key hires for a Senate run after commissioning a poll that tested his favorability against Markey. Those close to the three-term congressman told POLITICO earlier this week that he\u2019s seriously considering getting in the race but hasn't reached a formal decision.\n\nIn her endorsement, Ocasio-Cortez shouted out Markey\u2019s progressive credentials, calling him \u201cA proud and strong progressive champion for working families. Not just in Massachusetts, but across the country.\u201d\n\nThe 29-year-old worked with Markey earlier this year to put out the Green New Deal, the landmark climate change proposal that has been the subject of mockery by Republicans and division within the Democratic Party. Ocasio-Cortez emphasizes that in her video, saying that Markey is \u201cone of the few people that had the courage to stand up and take a chance.\"\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen.

Ocasio-Cortez also addressed this dynamic in her endorsement.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not just resting on his record of the past, but he's aggressively pursuing an agenda for the future,\u201d she said of Markey. \u201cAnd that's what a progressive is, and that's what progressivism is all about.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement comes just weeks after Markey nabbed key backing from his fellow Massachusetts Senate colleague and a 2020 front-runner, Elizabeth Warren. The freshman congresswoman's endorsement, however, is significant because of her immense popularity among liberal Democrats. She is also among the most outspoken in the party when it comes to her endorsement of challengers of Democratic incumbents, which has earned her some consternation in the party.", "description": "Ocasio-Cortez shouted out Markey\u2019s progressive credentials, calling him \u201cA proud and strong progressive champion for working families.\"", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fb/13/41eb99cd49218634cf71ba744530/20190913-aoc-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
