It's time to abolish medical debt | Astra Taylor", "language": "en", "text": "In 2012, an activist-led project called the Rolling Jubilee grabbed international headlines by raising enough money online from small dollar donations to buy and eradicate almost $15m of medical debt.\n\nI was part of the group that spearheaded the effort. We sent letters to thousands of people across the country telling them their debts had been erased, no strings attached.\n\nWhy did we do it? The answer is simple: healthcare is a human right and medical debt is a moral and political abomination. In the richest country in the world, it is obscene that millions of people are pushed into poverty and insolvency because they had the bad luck of getting sick and needing to see a doctor.\n\nLast week, the presidential candidate Bernie Sanders followed in the Rolling Jubilee\u2019s footsteps. His campaign made history by declaring that $81bn of past-due medical debt belonging to more than 46 million people would be wiped out should he win the White House. Under a Sanders administration, \u201cthe federal government will negotiate and pay off past-due medical bills in collections that have been reported to credit agencies\u201d.\n\nSanders also proposed that the IRS \u201creview the billing and collection practices of the nearly 3,000 non-profit hospitals to ensure they are in line with the charitable care standards for non-profit tax status, and take action against those who are not\u201d.\n\nThrilled as we are to see a presidential candidate proposing to scale up the basic premise of our scrappy activist project to the national level, we believe that buying medical debt is not necessarily the best approach. Why should debt holders\u2019 property rights be respected when the debts in question are immoral to begin with?\n\nOne reason debt collectors are notorious for desperate, high pressure and deceptive tactics is because the vast majority of medical debt in collections is already out of statute. There is no legal force these collectors can appeal to in order to compel payment on out-of-statute debt, which is why many hospitals and collectors end up writing this debt off. What\u2019s more, as many as 94% of debts cannot be substantiated in court because creditors lack the necessary paperwork. (This is why the Debt Collective has created a debt dispute tool that anyone can use, free of charge, to challenge any debt currently in collection, including medical bills. If you take the time to dispute your debts, there\u2019s a good chance the collector will back off and you won\u2019t have to pay.)\n\nSanders knows this. That\u2019s why, under his plan, the government would \u201c[p]rohibit the collection of debt beyond the statute of limitations\u201d. But that raises a question: why not take that logic further - and effectively prohibit the collection of all medical debt?\n\nThe US hospitals suing the poor over bills they can't afford Read more\n\nThe secondary market for medical debt only exists because the state enforces the legitimacy of the debts in courts of law. The government should start to treat medical debt the way it treats debts to the mafia, which is to say that such debts have no legal legitimacy. If the state stopped defending the property rights of predators, the problem of medical debt would disappear.\n\nWe need a method of debt cancellation that refuses to compromise with vultures who profit from suffering. That said, if government officials insist on purchasing medical debts in order to erase them, they should do it in a way that paves the way for more wide-scale debt relief for those who desperately need it.\n\nConsider an idea from the British journalist Grace Blakely. In her book Stolen: How to Save the World From Financialization, she proposes a new public banking system that could buy various kinds of debts, imposing a haircut on private banks and creditors, in order to refinance them at dramatically reduced interest rates or even write them off entirely. Variations of this idea could be used to address not only the problem of unpayable healthcare costs but the broader crisis of American consumer debt, ranging from mortgages to credit cards to payday loans.\n\nJust last year, the Debt Collective executive director, Laura Hanna, a veteran of the Rolling Jubilee, advised the New York state assemblyman Ron Kim on a plan to redefine debt as property under eminent domain law. This brilliant conceptual leap would allow public officials working at the state level to reimagine ways to protect their constituents from bad financial actors.\n\nLast year, 8 million people were pushed into poverty because of medical expenses. The personal stories told at a recent Sanders-hosted town hall were gut-wrenching: a beloved wife who died of colon cancer, avoiding treatment because of the expense; a $40,000 bill for an ectopic pregnancy that didn\u2019t even require an overnight stay; families rationing life-saving medicine such as insulin between ill parents and young children.\n\nAny truly permanent solution to our medical debt crisis must tackle the problem at the root. No one should have to choose between life-saving medical care or food and shelter, and in countries with free and universal healthcare, medical debt doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIn the meantime, we can back candidates who accurately diagnose the problem of medical debt and are willing to fight for indebted Americans who need help. Sanders\u2019 plan gets us closest to a cure.", "description": "Healthcare is a human right and medical debt is a moral abomination.
