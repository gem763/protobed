Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) faced boos and chants of \u201cFour more years!\u201d (for President Donald Trump) as she faced town halls in her district this weekend.\n\nSlotkin was one of the \u201cfreshman seven\u201d who signed an op-ed in the Washington Post on Sep. 24 supporting an impeachment inquiry. None of them had seen the actual evidence \u2014 the transcript (or \u201creadout\u201d) of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky; all were willing to risk their careers, and the country, in advance of seeing the facts.\n\nAnd as Slotkin found out this weekend, many of her constituents are unhappy about it. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, published a video of one exchange in Rochester, Michigan, on Friday evening:\n\nSlotkin has also faced pushback at other recent town halls in Michigan\u2019s eighth congressional district, the Detroit News reported Monday:\n\nInside the crowded gatherings, Slotkin spoke of prescription drug reform, infrastructure and education funding. But it was her recent support of an impeachment inquiry that raised a cacophony of applause, boos and mingled shouts of \u201cLet her speak\u201d and \u201cFake news.\u201d \u201cI know that it\u2019s clearly not popular,\u201d Slotkin said Thursday in Hartland. \u201cBut I just felt compelled to do it because I just don\u2019t know where this ends.\u201d For the first-term Democratic lawmaker in a Republican-leaning district, the residents\u2019 reactions to Slotkin\u2019s impeachment decision could make a world of difference in the upcoming 2020 race in the 8th Congressional District. Slotkin won by nearly 4 percentage points over Rep. Mike Bishop, R-Rochester, in 2018, while Trump won the district by nearly 7 percentage points in 2016.\n\nCNN also aired footage of objections from another town hall, in Hartland Township on Thursday:\n\nSlotkin is just the latest impeachment-supporting Democrat in a swing district to face objections from her constituents.\n\nPolitico reported Sunday that first-term Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL) faces similar outrage in the sixth congressional district of Illinois, in the western suburbs of Chicago.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
