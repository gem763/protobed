The documents given to lawmakers at that briefing \u201craise troubling questions about apparent efforts inside and outside the Trump Administration to target specific officials,\u201d the statement said, including former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\n\u201cThe documents provided by the Inspector General included a package of disinformation, debunked conspiracy theories, and baseless allegations in an envelope marked \u2018White House\u2019 and containing folders labeled \u2018Trump Hotel,\u2019\u201d the statement read. \u201cThese documents also reinforce concern that the President and his allies sought to use the machinery of the State Department to further the President\u2019s personal political interests.\u201d\n\nThe committee chairmen further noted that the IG \u201cstated that his office interviewed Secretary Pompeo\u2019s Counselor, Thomas Ulrich Brechbuhl, who informed the Inspector General that Secretary Pompeo told him the packet \u2018came over,\u2019 and that Brechbuhl presumed it was from the White House.\u201d\n\nGiuliani later appeared on Fox News\u2019 Hannity, where he boasted about the Ukrainian documents he had fed to the State Department in the spring.\n\n\u201cAnd the committees, I guess, they were sitting there figuring out how they can do impeachment based on nothing and what they got shoved down their throats, it\u2019s a complete, total absolutely terrific prosecutorial outline of why Joe Biden is so guilty,\u201d Giuliani exclaimed to Trump-boosting host Sean Hannity. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke for me to describe it to you.\u201d\n\nGiuliani also credited conservative columnist John Solomon\u2014who apparently shared his Ukraine stories with Giuliani\u2019s allies before publication\u2014with helping to get his Ukraine-Biden narrative to the forefront.\n\n\u201cUltimately it was John Solomon, who should get a Pulitzer Prize, by the way, put them all on tape, so it\u2019s all memorialized on videotape,\u201d he declared, referencing Solomon\u2019s interviews with Ukrainian figures. \u201cThis is as solid as it can get.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Congress subpoenaed Giuliani for records relating to the Ukraine controversy that blew up following a whistleblower's complaint about the infamous July 25 call in which President Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens. The president's attorney has since hired a lawyer to represent him during the congressional investigation.", "description": "Trump\u2019s personal attorney reportedly said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told him he would \u201crefer\u201d allegations against Biden \u201cfor investigation.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2361,w_4199,x_0,y_236/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570067080/RTX75RS4_apoc9q"}
