But Reinstein, 57, watched as real-estate prices skyrocketed (in just the past decade or so, home values have nearly doubled, according to Zillow) and many artists and less wealthy people had to move out. Nowadays, \u201cSan Francisco is only for the wealthy \u2014 the super wealthy \u2014 unless you\u2019re willing to live with five roommates,\u201d she jokes.\n\nDo you have an interesting retirement story? Email chill@marketwatch.com with your story.\n\nAs she was watching San Francisco become a hub for the rich, she had a financial setback of her own: a divorce, in which she and her spouse had to split up their assets. And the divorce necessitated she move out of the family home, so she was spending $4,000 a month on a tiny pad to share with her daughter, Eva, she says.\n\n\u201cWhen Eva was in high school I started to think, do I really need to be here? There are lots of other places I can go.\u201d And the more she thought about it, the more she realized: \u201cScrew this, I gotta get out of here,\u201d Reinstein says with a laugh. \u201cI was ready for a break from the high cost, crowds and Google-fueled insanity of the Bay Area.\u201d\n\nPlus, she loved to flip houses (she\u2019d done a couple in California years ago, before the real-estate prices were so high) and knew that was out of the question for her to do in the Bay Area \u2014 so she and her new partner, Peter, considered where else they could live. \u201cWe thought for a microsecond that Arizona might be the place, but it was way too hot in the summer.\u201d\n\nRoberta Reinstein Roberta Reinstein and her partner, Peter.\n\nThey settled on Albuquerque for a number of reasons, including the weather, affordability of real estate, access to outdoor activities and the fact that Reinstein\u2019s best friend had recently moved there.\n\nHere\u2019s what life is like in ABQ.\n\nThe area: Though it\u2019s perhaps best known for its annual hot-air balloon festival and being the setting for AMC\u2019s hit show \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d, ABQ \u2014 which has a population of roughly 550,000 \u2014 has a lot more going for it than that. \u201cAlbuquerque is a delightful, quirky hidden gem,\u201d says Reinstein.\n\niStock The Albuquerque Skyline at dusk.\n\nIt\u2019s an artsy spot \u2014 there are hundreds of galleries and art studios; monthly art crawls, and a robust performing-arts scene \u2014 and a city where outdoor enthusiasts flock to. That\u2019s helped along by the miles of hiking and biking trails in the adjacent Sandia and Manzano Mountains, as well as the roughly 300 days of sunshine. (Though January average lows are in the mid-20s, and July highs hit the low 90s.) And Reinstein tells MarketWatch she loves that it\u2019s a diverse city with its own unique cuisine and celebrations.\n\nOf course, there are downsides: Overall crime is high, though Reinstein says that while there are some not-so-desirable neighborhoods, there are plenty of areas that are safe. She adds that she\u2019s never been the victim of a crime other than someone stealing a hose from one of the homes she was flipping. And there is \u201ca fair amount of poverty,\u201d says Reinstein. Plus, she says, the city can feel like it has a lot of sprawl, and she misses great Asian food.\n\nRoberta Reinstein View of the mountains from Reinstein\u2019s yard\n\nHere\u2019s what MarketWatch recently wrote about Albuquerque.\n\nThe cost: Though Reinstein doesn\u2019t keep a strict budget, she estimates that she probably spends about $3,000 a month to live in Albuquerque \u2014 despite having pricey hobbies like owning two horses \u2014 it costs her $1,250 a month to board them, which is her most significant expense. She says that most things are cheaper in Albuquerque than they were in San Francisco, including energy and gas, and estimates that she spends roughly 70% less a month than she did in the Bay Area.\n\nReinstein at the nearby stables.\n\nThe biggest way she saves money is by not having a mortgage on her home: She bought the four-bedroom, three-bath home that sits on an acre of land for $240,000, using a combination of savings, her divorce settlement and proceeds from homes she bought and flipped in Arizona and New Mexico, she says. And she adds that you can get a \u201cnice house in a decent neighborhood for under $200,000\u201d with smaller homes to be had for $100,000 or so, and can rent a nice place for $700 to $800 a month. Plus, she drives an older car \u2014 \u201ca ratty Toyota Tundra truck\u201d \u2014 she explains, so she doesn\u2019t have a car loan.\n\nRoberta Reinstein The sitting room in Reinstein\u2019s home.\n\nIndeed, the cost of living and property taxes in Albuquerque are slightly below average for the U.S., median homes cost under $200,000, according to Sperling\u2019s Best Places \u2014 and you can read about New Mexico\u2019s tax situation here.\n\nThe bottom line: Reinstein says she plans to stay. \u201cPeople are super friendly,\u201d she adds, noting that it\u2019s easy to make friends and get involved in things here. She\u2019s part of a ladies walking group in the neighborhood and has made friends from her barn. \u201cI have like two people I still correspond with [from the Bay Area],\u201d she jokes, adding that \u201cI was so wrapped up in my own world there.\u201d But in ABQ, she says: \u201cI had to go back to managing my schedule because I can\u2019t get stuff done. I have so much to do here.\u201d", "description": "The pros and cons of retiring to the setting of \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS615_dog_la_MG_20191003142719.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
