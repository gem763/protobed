I\u2019m fed up of talking about penalties we should have had. Arsenal on Monday and now. That\u2019s a penalty 100 times out of 100.\n\n\u201cThe linesman today can look straight at the tackle on Marcus. He just wipes his foot. It\u2019s a bad decision. Unfortunately for us we didn\u2019t get it.\n\n\u201cNo point me complaining, but there will come a point where these decisions will turn out way.\n\n\u201cToday was the decision of the referee, it should have been a penalty. We could have sat here smiling.\n\n\u201cThere are many games we could and should have won away from home. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue today. It\u2019s a good away point. In a group, if you get a point away, win all your home games, you go through.\u201d", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer declared himself \u201cvery pleased\u201d despite Manchester United\u2019s long wait for an away victory stretching to ten games.
