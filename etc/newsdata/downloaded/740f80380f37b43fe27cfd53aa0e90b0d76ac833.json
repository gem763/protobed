This is not about me. This is about the American people,\u201d the former vice president told supporters at the East Las Vegas Community Center in Nevada. He repeated the phrase \u201cthis is not about me\u201d multiple times during his speech.\n\nThe campaign appearance was Biden\u2019s first public event since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she would begin a formal impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nThe inquiry puts Biden in a unique position: His campaign has been fixated on Trump since the moment it began, but Trump\u2019s troubles that triggered the impeachment inquiry are explicitly connected to unproven allegations about Biden\u2019s family.\n\nThe risks for Biden are clear, no matter the credibility of Trump\u2019s allegations. \u201cI think it might define him with Trump. I\u2019m worried it might be kind of like with Hillary,\u201d Sandra Ackerman, 74, said before Biden spoke, referring to how Trump and his allies portrayed Hillary Clinton as corrupt or \u201ccrooked\u201d in 2016. \u201cI think he might try to explain it a little more, but it\u2019s kind of hard because it\u2019s his son.\u201d\n\nBut in Las Vegas, at least, the voters who came out to see Biden speak on Friday were undaunted and largely comfortable with how the candidate was handling the situation he\u2019s suddenly found himself in.\n\nBiden cast Trump\u2019s attempt to push Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate his son\u2019s time on the board of a Ukrainian gas company as an attempt to \u201chijack the election so that we\u2019re not going to focus on your lives.\u201d And he again said that \u201cevery major publication in America and around the world\u201d had found that the president\u2019s claims about the Biden family in Ukraine were \u201cdead wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut again, it\u2019s not about me,\u201d Biden told the crowd in Las Vegas. \u201cWe\u2019ll overcome this. This is fine. My family will handle this, but I\u2019m worried about all of the families and all of the lives that are at stake in this election because of his failure as a president.\u201d\n\nBiden then returned to some regular campaign stop talking points: health care, gun control, and climate change.\n\nSeveral people in the audience of mostly older Nevadans told BuzzFeed News they were happy Biden addressed Trump\u2019s allegations about his family without going into great detail.\n\nAnd all of the more than 20 voters who spoke to BuzzFeed News at the event said their views of Biden were not changed by Trump\u2019s suggestion that there was a scandal to be uncovered about his son\u2019s conduct in Ukraine or his own conduct as vice president.\n\n\u201cNobody that has a brain would buy into that stuff,\u201d said James Katzen, 70. \u201cAlong with all the other twelve thousand lies, there\u2019s been no corroboration of anything [Trump] has ever said in his life.\u201d\n\nWhile most of them said they approved of Biden\u2019s brief remarks, a few people said they\u2019d like to see him explain the details of the Ukraine episode at greater length to make sure it doesn\u2019t damage his campaign.\n\nStephanie McCoole, like most of the voters who spoke to BuzzFeed News, said she didn't want Biden to talk at greater length about it.\n\n\u201cI actually am happy that he\u2019s not that defensive, because Trump\u2019s a bully, and bullies want you to respond,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe went to the point and he told us what we needed to know,\u201d said Sandra Lopez, 44. \u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s true or not, it doesn\u2019t matter. We need a change.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine was released Thursday, and the White House on Wednesday released a non-verbatim transcript of a July phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to do him a \u201cfavor\u201d and investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Trump said on the call, appearing to refer to Attorney General William Barr, according to the record of the call. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian prosecutor who first raised allegations of corruption against Hunter Biden has said, most recently on Thursday in comments to the Washington Post, that he does not believe that Hunter Biden broke any Ukrainian laws.\n\n\u201cFrom the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s former prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, told the Post.\n\nHunter Biden was on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma for five years. Lutsenko\u2019s predecessor, Viktor Shokin, investigated the company\u2019s management for possible abuse of power before Hunter Biden joined the board; Biden himself was never under investigation or implicated in wrongdoing.\n\nDuring his tenure as vice president, Joe Biden was one of several international leaders who pushed Ukrainian authorities to fire Shokin for not aggressively pursuing corruption investigations.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint said that several White House officials were concerned that Trump had used \u201chis office for personal gain\u201d in asking the president of another country to investigate a political rival, leaving them \u201cdeeply disturbed,\u201d the whistleblower wrote.", "description": "Biden held his first public campaign event on Friday since the announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump.", "authors": ["Nidhi Prakash", "Buzzfeed News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-09/28/0/asset/18ccbd9fe4ec/sub-buzz-2854-1569631302-1.jpg?crop=3000:1570;0,215", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
