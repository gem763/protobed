But behind the pink-and-blue-hued ads showcasing the stars Jennifer Lopez and Cardi B, lies powerful commentary on the nature of female intimacy, a mass market shell hiding surprisingly incisive feminism.\n\nHustlers review \u2013 J-Lo's stealing strippers saga is a vicarious thrill Read more\n\nBased on a 2015 New York Magazine article by Jessica Pressler, the film follows a band of strippers as they drug unsuspecting Wall Street bankers post-recession while running up their credit cards, with Ramona (Lopez) and Destiny (Constance Wu) at the scheme\u2019s helm. Sandwiched between a poppy soundtrack and J-Lo\u2019s acrobatic poledancing are insights on the romance of friendship, capitalism in America and the potential and pitfalls of female solidarity.\n\nAfter seeing Ramona dance for the first time \u2013 a glittery display of agile ass-shaking that ends with her rolling around on the floor in a pile of money \u2013 bright-eyed and bushy-tailed newbie Destiny tiptoes outside to join her while she smokes a cigarette. Jacketless, Ramona draws Destiny into the warmth of her fur coat. She rests her chin on Destiny\u2019s head. Destiny looks up at Ramona innocently. It\u2019s a scene of startling intimacy and one can already feel the energy between the pair molding into something like love, an early sign of their ride-or-die bond. We\u2019re accustomed to seeing films present sisterly loyalty soon ruptured by jealousy but instead, Hustlers shows something far less cliche.\n\nThe film, written and directed by Lorene Scafaria (a rare female lens for a film about stripping), perfectly captures both the depth and fragility of girlfriends who feel more like family and there\u2019s sincerity within the performances of Wu and Lopez. As the maternal lioness, Lopez exudes warmth while also maintaining her position as the project\u2019s in-control mastermind. For her part, Wu embodies the clever protege gunning for independence, who sees in Ramona both strategy and support. We feel every swell of euphoric acceptance and sting of betrayal between the women. In the end, both are blinded and blindsided by their love for each other.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lili Reinhart, Jennifer Lopez, Keke Palmer and Constance Wu in Hustlers.

Destiny admits she\u2019s accepted a plea deal from the police and for a moment, Ramona can\u2019t contain her feelings. She tries to hold back tears, but her role as the fierce pack mom cracks all the same. When Destiny explains that she took the deal to protect her daughter Lily, Ramona nods her head and gives a tender look of understanding. \u201cMotherhood is a mental illness,\u201d she sighs, before burying Destiny in a hug, only to let her go abruptly and stalk away.\n\nPart of what bonds Destiny and Ramona is their shared understanding of what it takes to survive in America. Moving through life by the skin of their teeth, Destiny and Ramona\u2019s Robin Hood plan to steal from the rich to give to the poor only highlights the ways in which the American dream fails women of color.\n\nIn a subtle yet piercing way, Hustlers calls for an intersectional approach to female allyship. Pressler is played on-screen by a prim Julia Stiles, renamed as Jennifer rather than Jessica, and her scenes with Destiny highlight an ignorance over cultural and class differences which has arguably led to today\u2019s sorry state of female solidarity. While being interviewed, Destiny questions Jennifer\u2019s singular interest in the Wall Street druggings above all else. \u201cKind of hard not to be,\u201d Stiles replies dismissively. Without missing a beat, Destiny flatly asks where Jennifer went to school (Brown) and what her parents did for a living (a journalist and a psychologist), highlighting the sweeping differences in opportunity between them. Jennifer\u2019s power (and profit) depends on her ability to frame a decision that Destiny is still atoning for. In a recent Vanity Fair article, Samantha Barbash from whom J-Lo\u2019s character Ramona takes her inspiration, claimed that she did not participate in the making of the movie because they did not offer her enough money. \u201cI have bags that are worth more than what they wanted to pay me,\u201d she claimed. This leaves one to wonder if Hustlers has lived up to its own call to action.\n\nMale violence also flickers under the film\u2019s surface, the shadow of patriarchy always looming. The tension is most palpable in scenes where the dancers are alone in the champagne room with clients. Money buys sex but the women giving pleasure are completely dispensable to the men receiving it. \u201cIt\u2019s OK if you don\u2019t believe me,\u201d Destiny tells Jennifer, \u201cI\u2019m used to people not believing me.\u201d This poignant line highlights the improbability yet vital necessity of women supporting each other at a time when it\u2019s needed more than ever. As the recently surfaced Kavanaugh sexual assault allegations and Chanel Miller\u2019s new book make clear, if women don\u2019t listen to each other, no one will. By the time Ramona\u2019s plot springs into action, no one feels sorry for the trickling bank accounts of the Wall Street tycoons, the context of the 2008 recession allowing for a wider critique of capitalism. \u201cThis whole country\u2019s a strip club,\u201d Ramona clarifies, \u201cYou have people tossing the money and people doing the dance.\u201d\n\nIn a year in which gender inequality and the possibility of economic recession remain as worryingly relevant as they did 10 years ago, Hustlers provides a vital and melancholic look at power imbalance in America. It\u2019s a film that points to the country\u2019s own frustrating contradictions \u2013 the rising awareness of male toxicity yet the the minimal accountability for it, the feminist movement\u2019s troubling lack of inclusivity \u2013 but its sincerity is ultimately most overwhelming. Women are urged to stick together rather than drift apart both in the strip club and in the world at large.", "description": "In the acclaimed fact-based drama, the bond between women is shown with rare sensitivity and depth even as they engage in criminal acts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a48f077da4ef5f042e1ab5a2f77b6f99c62e8b/0_149_2232_1339/master/2232.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=17b2a0ff86dced2664041b9df7662a2a", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
