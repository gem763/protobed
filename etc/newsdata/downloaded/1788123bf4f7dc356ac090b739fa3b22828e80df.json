Company-imposed fees accounted for $37, government fees and taxes were about $13, premium services were $9 and miscellaneous fees were $1, it found.\n\nConsumer Reports argues that these additional fees are often slapped on consumers for items that could be classified as a cable company\u2019s basic \u201ccost of doing business\u201d \u2014 for instance, a \u201cbroadcast TV fee\u201d meant to account for the cost of getting programming from broadcasters \u2014 and often aren\u2019t made obvious to consumers. Companies sometimes offer inaccurate, confusing or partial details about their fees, the group charged, including misstating that some fees are government-mandated.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, people don\u2019t know these fees exist,\u201d report author Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for Consumer Reports, told MarketWatch. Even in what appear to be fixed-rate contracts, he added, companies sometimes allow themselves \u201cwiggle room\u201d in the fine print to increase fees.\n\nCommon company-imposed fees include regional sports fees, set-top box rental fees, cable modem and/or router fees, administrative and convenience fees, and installation fees, the report said. Other additional fees might include government fees and taxes, as well as optional charges for premium services.\n\nAnd fees are only going up, Consumer Reports warns. Comcast\u2019s CMCSA, -1.06% regional sports fee and broadcast TV fee cost a combined $2.50 a month in 2015, the organization said by way of example, but now cost a monthly $18.25.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge that yes, their costs are going up,\u201d Schwantes said. \u201cBut it sure seems like the consumers are left holding the bag.\u201d\n\nA national survey published by the nonprofit in January found that 69% of consumers who had used cable, internet or phone providers over the previous two years had experienced \u201chidden or unexpected fees,\u201d and 59% of customers who reported facing such fees said the added expense had made them blow past their budgets.\n\nMarketWatch has reached out for comment from several of the cable and internet companies mentioned in the report about their fees, including AT&T T, -0.88%, Charter Communications CHTR, +1.27%, Comcast and Verizon VZ, -1.57%.\n\nA Cox Communications spokesman told MarketWatch: \u201cUnfortunately, the cost of content continues to rise at unsustainable rates, something that is becoming clearer with recent streaming video-service price increases once they have gained initial share. The primary drivers of costs continue to be sports content and local broadcast retransmission fees, and we try to be transparent by indicating that on the bill.\u201d\n\nAn Altice USA ATUS, -0.11% spokeswoman reached for comment touted the company\u2019s \u201cincredibly competitive pricing\u201d and investment in its network, but added that \u201crising programming fees are a large driver in rising costs.\u201d \u201cWe break out those costs on bills to help educate customers to the impact rising content fees have on their bills,\u201d she said, pointing to a company website that explains programmers\u2019 fee increases.\n\nAnd a Frontier Communications FTR, +1.05% spokesman said that fee increases \u201creflect the increased cost of providing services, including ever-increasing costs to access programming content, the growing cost to maintain and upkeep the infrastructure of a robust broadband network and the rapidly rising costs of supporting our customers\u2019 increased demand for bandwidth through greater internet usage and over-the-top video content.\u201d When possible, he said, the company seeks to minimize the increasing costs\u2019 impact on consumers.\n\nOn the transparency front, the spokesman added, the company \u201cprovides specificity about and detail of all charges on its bill.\u201d \u201cInformation about applicable fees is disclosed at the point of sale and on Frontier\u2019s website,\u201d he said. \u201cFrontier also provides notice to consumers of in advance of any changes to these fees.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese companies take seriously the responsibility to provide their customers with clear and relevant information related to the services they enjoy, and work diligently to develop and use consumer-friendly ways of conveying such information, including websites, apps, delivery of monthly itemized statements and more,\u201d a spokesman for the Internet & Television Association, a trade group, told MarketWatch in a statement.\n\nConsumer Reports said it had also sent inquiries to cable and internet companies, outlining three main explanations of billing practices that emerged from the handful of companies that replied.\n\nOne explanation, according to Consumer Reports, was that such fees are perfectly legal. (\u201cIt is true that, in implementing the 1992 Cable Act, the FCC explicitly opened the door to itemization of regulatory pass-through fees and taxes, as well as company-imposed fees,\u201d Consumer Reports noted.)\n\nAnother was that companies apply fees in a transparent manner and provide customers with sufficient information to make decisions. (\u201cCan they get it right all the time? No, that\u2019s hard for any company,\u201d Schwantes said. \u201cBut we think they\u2019re not as transparent as they claim they are.\u201d)\n\nA third, according to the report, was that obtaining programming from broadcasters has become increasingly expensive. (\u201cThough there is a kernel of truth in this explanation, what is left unexplained is why these costs are passed on to consumers in the form of fees and not included in the base package price,\u201d Consumer Reports said.)\n\nConsumer Reports recommends a range of policy remedies to address the fee issue: For starters, it said, Congress should pass the TRUE Fees Act (short for \u201cTruth-in-Billing, Remedies and User Empowerment over Fees Act\u201d), legislation that would require cable and internet providers to include all fees in the advertised price. The Federal Communications Commission should change its stance on itemization of company-imposed fees, the group added, and state attorneys general should enforce consumer-protection laws in this arena.\n\nConsumers, for their part, can \u201ccut the cord\u201d \u2014 that is, keep their internet service but cancel video services, relying on alternatives like streaming services. \u201cMost of the company-imposed fees are attached to video service,\u201d Schwantes said. \u201cIf you have the internet-only service, you\u2019re going to avoid most of the fees.\u201d\n\nBut this is an imperfect solution, he added, as some providers have recently begun charging internet service-related fees \u2014 take Frontier\u2019s $2 internet infrastructure surcharge, for example. (The Frontier spokesman said that the fee \u201cpartially recovers costs for facility and infrastructure relocations mandated by state and/or local governments,\u201d and only recovers about a third of costs incurred.)\n\nCable customers can also urge Congress to act, Schwantes said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get rid of the fees,\u201d he said, \u201cbut at least they\u2019re all rolled into the advertised price.\u201d\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, -1.86% is up 11.8% for the year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, -1.79% is up 15.2% over the same period.", "description": "Extra fees imposed by cable companies tack a 24% surcharge on to the price advertised, according to a new Consumer Reports analysis.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS515_cable_ZG_20191002165122.jpg"}
