(We also heard some threatening audio of him discussing the whistleblowing with his staff.) The whistleblower further alleged that the White House had covered it all up by moving the transcript of the request for foreign interference into \u201ca separate system reserved for classified information that is especially sensitive,\u201d as the New York Times described it. That\u2019s a pretty good tech-and-democracy story, but it\u2019s not really our kind of tech-and-democracy story, and so here we are with a newsletter about our kind of tech-and-democracy stories on a day when you could be forgiven for only wanting to read about the whistleblower\u2019s kind.\n\nThat\u2019s a long way of saying that I forgive you if you\u2019d like to skip today\u2019s news and instead just read nothing but explainers and Twitter threads about impeachment. It\u2019s kind of the biggest story in the world right now, and it will all play out in new and exciting and probably terrifying ways across all our big social platforms, and if you want to read some speculation on how I\u2019d point you to this savvy Kevin Roose piece on the subject (further excerpted below).\n\nBut say you\u2019ve finished your impeachment reading for the day and are eager to luxuriate in a good old-fashioned tale of platform-based information warfare. In that case may I please recommend a new report from researchers at Oxford University on the usage of disinformation campaigns by governments around the world. And usage is ... well, I bet you can guess!\n\nHere\u2019s Davey Alba and Adam Satariano in the New York Times:\n\nThe researchers compiled information from news organizations, civil society groups and governments to create one of the most comprehensive inventories of disinformation practices by governments around the world. They found that the number of countries with political disinformation campaigns more than doubled to 70 in the last two years, with evidence of at least one political party or government entity in each of those countries engaging in social media manipulation. In addition, Facebook remains the No. 1 social network for disinformation, the report said. Organized propaganda campaigns were found on the platform in 56 countries.\n\nYou can read the report yourself here. Personally I found it useful to just read a straightforward guide to the varieties of state-sponsored information attacks \u2014 most of which have long been in use, of course, by more garden-variety trolls.\n\nCyber troops use a variety of communication strategies. We have categorized these activities into four categories: (1) the creation of disinformation or manipulated media; (2) mass-reporting of content or accounts; (3) data-driven strategies; (4) trolling, doxing or harassment; (5) amplifying content and media online. The creation of disinformation or manipulated media is the most common communication strategy. In 52 out of the 70 countries we examined, cyber troops actively created content such as memes, videos, fake news websites or manipulated media in order to mislead users. Sometimes, the content created by cyber troops is targeted at specific communities or segments of users. By using online and offline sources of data about users, and paying for advertisements on popular social media platforms, some cyber troops target specific communities with disinformation or manipulated media.\n\nMost of these strategies are fairly cheap to employ, which is what can make them so effective. As the Times reporters note, governments around the world are using them for the most obvious of purposes: spreading positive stories about the governments and quashing dissent. Which raises the question: Why aren\u2019t more governments doing this?\n\nI suspect they will soon, if they\u2019re not already. As security researcher Thaddeus E. Grugq wrote about the Oxford study: \u201c120 countries are lying.\u201d\n\nThe Ratio\n\nToday in news that could affect public perception of tech platforms.\n\nTrending down: Facebook has raised nearly $1.6 million from SPLC-designated hate groups since May 2018, an investigation found.

(Sean O\u2019Kane / The Verge)\n\nGoverning\n\n\u2b50 On Tuesday, House Democrats announced they were launching an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. A disinformation campaign started shortly after. Kevin Roose reflects on the first impeachment of the social media era at The New York Times:\n\nAs impeachment looms, disinformation experts are bracing for a fresh cyclone of chaos, complete with fast-twitch media manipulation, droves of false and misleading claims, and hyper-polarized audiences fiercely clinging to their side\u2019s version of reality. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen quite a surge in disinformation in the last two days, most of it from trolls and bots, to a degree we haven\u2019t seen in a while,\u201d said Yoel Grinshpon, vice president of research at VineSight, a start-up that detects disinformation on social media. \u201cWe assume that this will last a few days, and then come back in waves, whenever a new development in the Biden story or the impeachment process comes to light.\u201d\n\nFacebook faces (!) a new antitrust investigation from the Justice Department, after prodding from Attorney General William Barr).

(David McLaughlin / Bloomberg)\n\nYouTube said it will remove content from politicians if it violates the company\u2019s standards, with the exception of videos that are considered to have educational, news, scientific or artistic value. The move comes after Facebook announced it won\u2019t take down posts from politicians, even if they\u2019re factually inaccurate or violate company guidelines. (Julia Alexander / The Verge)\n\nThe Texas attorney general\u2019s office is lawyering up for its probe into possible antitrust violations by Google.

The case is part of a years-long battle between Microsoft and the government over \u201csneak and peek\u201d searches in which the subject of a federal inquiry doesn\u2019t know their data has been requested or turned over. (Dina Bass / Bloomberg)\n\nThe young women leading the climate movement \u2014 many of them teenagers \u2014 are experiencing what seem to be coordinated online harassment, including threatening messages, doxxing and hacking. Greta Thunberg, the 16-year old Swedish activist, is getting the worst of it.\n\nIndustry\n\n\u2b50 TikTok\u2019s efforts to localize content moderation has resulted in the app banning content that\u2019s supportive of the gay community, even in countries where homosexuality has never been illegal. The new rules were applied on top of general content moderation guidelines, which included bans against some political speech in China (those guidelines were updated in May). Here\u2019s Alex Hern from The Guardian:\n\nAs well as the general moderation guidelines, described as the \u201cloose version\u201d to moderators, TikTok ran at least two other sets. One, the \u201cstrict\u201d guidelines, were used in countries with conservative moral codes, and contained a significantly more restrictive set of rules concerning nudity and vulgarity, which ban, for instance, \u201cpartially naked buttocks\u201d, exposed cleavage with \u201ca length of more than 1/3 of the whole cleavage length\u201d, and lengthy depictions of sanitary pads. The other was a set of guidelines for individual countries, which introduced new rules to deal with specific local controversies \u2013 but also further restricted what can be shown. For instance, the Guardian has seen Turkey-specific guidelines in which TikTok explicitly banned a swathe of content related to Kurdish separatism, and adds the country\u2019s founding father, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, and its president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, to the list of political leaders who cannot be criticised, defamed or spoofed on the platform.\n\nTikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance is trying to sell its Western news app, called TopBuzz.

Google\u2019s crackdown on Chinese developers is raising concerns about advertising and privacy practices of the Android developers who are based there. (Craig Silverman / BuzzFeed)\n\nMatch.com is being sued for allegedly connecting non-paying daters to fake accounts to get them to subscribe. The lawsuit filed against the Match Group \u2014 parent company of Tinder and Hinge \u2014 alleges Match.com notified daters of messages even after the company detected that the account sending the message was fraudulent. (Ashley Carman / The Verge)\n\nTwitch rebranded for the first time, with a series of colorful new logos that showcase its various identities, and the identities of its users.
