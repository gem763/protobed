Thank you!\u201d\n\nOne hour before, he defended the original decision on Twitter but hadn\u2019t announced plans would change.\n\n\u201cI thought I was doing something very good for our Country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 Leaders,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cIt is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, has tremendous ballrooms & meeting rooms, and each delegation would have its own 50 to 70 unit building. Would set up better than other alternatives. I announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA. But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters the resort in South Florida had been chosen over other choices because it is \u201cthe best place.\u201d\n\nTrump National Doral Golf Course near Miami opened in 1962 and consists of 800 acres. Trump purchased the property in 2012.\n\nThe White House had said the event would be run \u201cat cost,\u201d or without profit by the Trump Organization because of the emoluments clause of the Constitution that prohibits the president from accepting gifts and money from foreign governments.\n\nBut member of Congress suggested there was value because of the publicity of conducting the summit at the property.\n\n\u201cI read the emoluments clause again yesterday,\u201d U.S. Rep. Adam, a Republican from Illinois told CNN on Friday, \u201cand it talks about titles and nobility and all this. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a direct violation, but I don\u2019t understand why at this moment they had to do it.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans had defended the decision of the president, who is facing an impeachment in the House by Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe American people are much more concerned about not where it happens, but what happens at the event,\u201d GOP Rep. Jim Jordan told CNN.\n\nOn Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN that conducting the G7 at one of Trump\u2019s property was \u201ccompletely out of the question.\u201d\n\nFormer White House press Secretary Ari Fleischer tweeted: \u201cGood call.\u201d\n\nTony Schwartz, who ghost wrote Trump\u2019s The Art of the Deal, noted the quick reversal.\n\n\u201cTrump never admits being wrong on anything,\u201d he tweeted. Now, after fierce criticism for clear self-dealing, he says he won\u2019t hold G-7 at his own hotel after all. One more sign that he is feeling threatened and running scared.\u201d\n\nThe White House advance team scouted locations in California, Colorado, Hawaii, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee and Utah.\n\nMulvaney said the Trump administration ruled out Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, where the G7 took place in 2012.\n\nThe next G-7 is scheduled for June 10-12. This year\u2019s event was held Aug. 24-26 in the resort town of Biarritz, France, from where he first suggested his Doral property would be an ideal location.\n\nThe G-7 consists of the the United States, Italy, Japan, France, Great Britain, Canada and Germany. Russia was voted out in 2014 though Trump wants the nation back in.", "description": "Oct. 19 (UPI) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Saturday night announced that next year\u2019s G7 economic conference won\u2019t take place next summer", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
