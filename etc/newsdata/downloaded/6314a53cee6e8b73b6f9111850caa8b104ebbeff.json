My Kristin? Our Kristin?\u201d Mr. Lardner later recalled thinking. \u201cI\u2019d talked to her the afternoon before. Her last words to me were, \u2018I love you Dad.\u2019 Suddenly I had trouble breathing myself.\u201d\n\nMr. Lardner responded to the death of his youngest daughter in the only way he knew how: like an investigative reporter. In the weeks and months after her funeral, he traveled to Boston, where 21-year-old Kristin had been an art student, in a quest to understand the events that led to her murder, in broad daylight on a Boston street, by a troubled and abusive former boyfriend.\n\nThe resulting piece of journalism, a 9,000-word account published in The Post\u2019s Outlook commentary section six months after Kristin died, received the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for feature writing. The citation recognized Mr. Lardner\u2019s \u201cunflinching examination of his daughter\u2019s murder by a violent man who had slipped through the criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nThe Pulitzer is the most prestigious prize in journalism. When the award was announced, Mr. Lardner said he would \u201cgive anything not to have written\u201d the story that won it.\n\nMr. Lardner, who retired from The Post in 2004 after devoting four decades to covering events including the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the civil rights movement, the Watergate affair and its aftermath, bank malfeasance and assorted high-profile trials and scandals, died Sept. 21 at a hospice center in Aldie, Va. He was 85. The cause was complications from several strokes, said his daughter Helen Lardner.\n\nMr. Lardner descended from a long line of writers. A great-uncle was the celebrated humorist Ring Lardner, whose sons included Ring Lardner Jr., the Oscar-winning screenwriter. George Lardner\u2019s father was a golf columnist for outlets including Bell Syndicate.\n\nGeorge Lardner Jr. joined The Post in 1963 and quickly distinguished himself with his determined reporting and elegant writing. He was a junior Metropolitan desk reporter when Kennedy was shot in Dallas and penned an atmospheric piece published two days after the president died.\n\n\u201cA shroud of rain fell over Washington yesterday. It took up where tears had stopped,\u201d the article began before describing a black stole draped over the pew at St. Stephen Martyr Catholic Church where Kennedy had prayed and a bereft shoe shiner \u201cmechanically\u201d going about his work.\n\nKennedy\u2019s death would preoccupy Mr. Lardner for decades as he rose through The Post\u2019s national reporting ranks. He followed his reporting to the National Archives, where he physically examined the shirt and tie Kennedy had worn in Dallas for evidence of the bullet\u2019s trajectory, and investigated theories challenging the \u201clone gunman\u201d conclusion supported by the 1964 Warren Commission.\n\nDuring the presidential primaries of 1984, Mr. Lardner unearthed the details that Democratic candidate Gary Hart, a U.S. senator from Colorado, was one year older than he had claimed and, also contrary to Hart\u2019s version of the events, that Hart, and not his relatives, had proposed changing his surname to Hart from Hartpence as he set out on his political career. Those revelations helped spur further questions about the credibility of Hart, who ultimately lost the nomination to former vice president Walter Mondale.\n\n\u201cGeorge was the personification of the dogged reporter, and that Gary Hart anecdote to me was always the ultimate example,\u201d Robert G. Kaiser, a former top editor at The Post, said in an interview. \u201cI remember saying, \u2018How did you do this, how did you figure this out?\u2019 He said, \u2018I just looked up the records.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Lardner always said that his account of his daughter\u2019s death, which he later expanded into the book \u201cThe Stalking of Kristin\u201d (1995), was the most important story he ever wrote. He set out on the project, he said, when a police lieutenant asked him, \u201cYou\u2019re a reporter, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was sort of shame-faced,\u201d Mr. Lardner later recalled. \u201cI only had the vaguest idea what had happened to my own daughter.\u201d\n\nHe delved into his daughter\u2019s existence in Boston, finding a self-portrait in which the budding artist depicted bruises on her body, and into the life of her killer, Michael Cartier, who had a long history of violence against animals and women. He interviewed Cartier\u2019s parents and found that his daughter had obtained restraining orders against him.\n\n\u201cThe book\u2019s most important lesson is that Kristin did everything right,\u201d journalist and author Tina Rosenberg wrote in a review for the New York Times.\n\n\u201cMr. Lardner refutes the wide-spread belief that the courts offer effective protection to battered women, and that only women who fail to report domestic violence or drop charges continue to fall victim,\u201d the review continued. \u201cUnlike many battered women, Kristin was educated, sophisticated and free of the need to worry about children, with the time and resources to make the law work for her. Most important, she was a member of the class of people who believe the law when it promises to protect them. \u2018The Stalking of Kristin\u2019 reveals the tragic error of that trust.\u201d\n\nLeonard Downie Jr., who was The Post\u2019s executive editor when Mr. Lardner received the Pulitzer, remarked that \u201cthe doggedness you saw in that story was not unique to the murder of his daughter. That was George. That was who George was.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis Pulitzer Prize,\u201d Donald E. Graham, former publisher and chairman of The Post, wrote in an email, \u201cwas the only occasion when such an award was hideously sad. Everyone who knew him at the Post admired him more than we can say.\u201d\n\nGeorge Edmund Lardner Jr. was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 10, 1934. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in journalism from Marquette University in Milwaukee in 1956, later continuing his studies there with a master\u2019s degree.\n\nHe began his reporting career with the Worcester Telegram in Massachusetts, then worked for the Miami Herald before joining The Post. From 1964 to 1966, he penned the local column Potomac Watch.\n\nHe later covered events including the Chappaquiddick incident of 1969 \u2014 when U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) drove off a bridge in an accident that killed passenger Mary Jo Kopechne \u2014 as well as the Iran-contra scandal during the Reagan administration.\n\nAfter retiring from The Post, Mr. Lardner was a scholar in residence at the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University, writing extensively about presidential pardons.\n\nMr. Lardner\u2019s wife, the former Rosemary Schalk, died in 2007 after five decades of marriage. Survivors include four children, Helen Lardner of Ashburn, Va., Edmund Lardner of Washington, Charles Lardner of Lancaster, Pa., and Richard Lardner of Burke, Va.; a sister; and two grandchildren.\n\nMr. Lardner said his life was never the same after Kristin\u2019s death and, although it was painful to write about her murder, it was \u201ccomforting at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt kept Kristin with me,\u201d he told the Boston Globe. \u201cI still think of her running down the stairs, arms flung out, ready to give me a big hug. I think of our last phone conversation, just the day before she was killed, the one that ended with, \u2018I love you, Dad.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nChristopher Rouse, expressionistic composer who won Pulitzer Prize, dies at 70\n\nRobert Boyd, journalist who shared Pulitzer for Eagleton shock therapy revelations, dies at 91\n\nStuart Levy, microbiologist who sounded alarm on antibiotic resistance, dies at 80", "description": "After his daughter was murdered by an abusive former boyfriend in 1992, he wrote an account that he said became the most important story of his four-decade career.", "authors": ["Emily Langer", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5WLBRMG6CYI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
