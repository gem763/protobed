One way to pull together your hodgepodge collection of Ikea pieces, street finds, and vintage furniture is by rolling out an area rug, an instant fix that \u201cties the room together\u201d and adds a bit of coziness underfoot. (We\u2019re of the opinion that there\u2019s nothing like sprawling out on a cushy floor rug after a long day.) After speaking to plenty of interior designers about their favorites, we\u2019ve learned that area rugs can quickly get expensive, but luckily there are also a ton of affordable options out there in a range of on-trend styles like Moroccan and sheepskin, as well as rugs made from natural fiber. Below, we\u2019ve rounded up 18 of the nicest-looking area rugs you can buy on Amazon to help make your home feel a little more pulled together. And for more affordable Amazon finds, check out our list of the 11 best area rugs, as praised by hyperenthusiastic reviewers.\n\nUnique Loom Tribal Moroccan Nomad Plush Area Rug - 5' x 8' Moroccan-inspired rugs are everywhere these days, as the thick pile and abstract designs make them a popular choice in homes of all d\u00e9cor aesthetics.
