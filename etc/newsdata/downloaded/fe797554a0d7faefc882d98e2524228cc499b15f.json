In real numbers, that\u2019s 1.3m people out of work, a rise of 22,000.\n\nSome other numbers: the number of people in work fell 56,000, or 0.2 percentage points, to 32.7m. The difference between the two can be explained by the fact that there was also a rise in the number of \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d people. These include those who have retired, students, those looking after family or on long-term sick. Those classified as \u201cunemployed\u201d have to be actively seeking work.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

These numbers took the City, derided as doomsdayers by Brexit\u2019s increasingly unhinged backers, by surprise. They had expected a modest rise in employment. But the signs that the labour market is cooling off in response to Brexit, and the disastrous mishandling of it by Tory government, have been there for some time now.\n\nThey have been visible in the results put out by this country\u2019s coterie of listed recruiters PageGroup, Robert Walters and Hays, for several months. Fortuitously, the ONS released its figures on the same day that the last of those gave an update on its performance just days after both of its peers had issued profit warnings.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Overall fee income was more or less flat. But that was because its growing stable of international businesses were able to pick up some of the slack created by a marked weakness in, you\u2019ve guessed it, the UK.\n\nThe company recorded a 4 per cent fall in net fees generated in its home market. Its mix of business is also worth paying attention to. Hays corps of headhunters did ok with placing people in temporary positions. Fee income from that was flat. That generated by placing people in from full-time roles was, however, down 8 per cent.\n\nThe UK\u2019s labour market has proven surprisingly robust since the EU referendum and the consensus is that is because firms have hired people rather than investing in other things (business investment overall has fallen rather sharply). The former are, obviously, easier to get rid of, than, say, kit.\n\nBut the recruiters, and now the ONS\u2019s figures, show that they\u2019ve turned markedly cautious. Where they\u2019re hiring they\u2019re now more likely to do so on a temporary basis.\n\nOf the official figures, Matt Hughes, head of Labour market for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said this: \u201cThe employment rate is still rising year-on-year, but this growth has cooled noticeably in recent months.\u201d\n\nThere was a sting in the tail from him too: \u201cAmong the under-25s, the employment rate has actually started to fall on the year.\u201d\n\nYoung people, those who are just starting out, inevitably get hit first and hardest when the economy turns bad not least because they require investment on the part of employers to develop the skills they need.\n\nBrexit looms large over all of this. The costs it is imposing on every man woman and child in this country are rising rapidly. Only those who deny reality deny this.\n\nIt\u2019s often been pointed out that the people in charge of the project, like prime minister Boris Johnson, are largely wealthy individuals who will be able to weather a storm that will hit the most vulnerable the hardest.\n\nThe latest jobs data bears that out. When it comes to the labour market, young people are among the most vulnerable of all. They\u2019ve been sold down the river by their Brexit-backing elders.", "description": "The latest set of labour market figures provided yet another example of City\u00a0economists being overly optimistic about the future.\u00a0 Official figures for June-August reveal that the unemployment rate came off a 45-year-low to land at 3.9 per cent.
