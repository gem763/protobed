It is now \u00a31.30 for both methods of payment.\n\nFerry passengers incur the charge if they want to be dropped off or picked up by car, or park for the ferry at the end of the half-mile pier.\n\nWightlink runs ferry services from three ports on the Isle of Wight to the mainland, including crossings to Portsmouth, Fishbourne and Lymington\n\nThe crossing at Ryde, in the north east of the Isle of Wight, is at the end of a half mile-long pier. To drive to the end you need to pay a toll, which also gets 30 minutes parking, and for a few weeks those paying with cash paid more than those paying with card\n\nIn September, Wightlink, which runs ferry services between the Isle of Wight and the mainland, brought in the contactless payment system, charging 70p less for cards than cash for 30 minutes.\n\nBefore the contactless system came in last month, people paying in cash could get access for \u00a31. The machines also do not give change.\n\nPassengers who don't want to pay the toll, which allows people to drive down the pier road to the ferry, can either walk down the half-mile long stretch or get a train.\n\nHowever, one person who commutes regularly to Portsmouth said the train only met 50 per cent of ferries and cost more money, and walking down the pier was impractical in bad weather.\n\nJust over four hours after This is Money asked Wightlink why it charged people more for paying in cash, it told us it was scrapping the 70p gap and would charge everyone \u00a31.30.\n\nThe small print at the top here shows that Wightlink had been charging those wanting vehicle access to the ferry at the end of Ryde Pier \u00a31.30 if they paid with card, and \u00a32 if they paid with cash. Parking charges are extra on top of that.\n\nCharges were then updated to \u00a31.30 for access and 30 minutes parking for both cash and contactless payments\n\nWightlink's chief executive Keith Greenfield told This is Money the ferry company brought in the differential price in a bid to 'speed up access to the pier and reduce traffic congestion, which is assisted by people using contactless payments which are quicker than cash.\n\n'For a few weeks we had a differential price of \u00a32.00 for cash and \u00a31.30 for cards to encourage people to use contactless cards.\n\n'Most people are now paying by this method and so we have now harmonised pricing from this week.'\n\nHowever, the new system was hardly foolproof.\n\nThe island's local radio station reported only a few days ago that a fault with the new contactless payment system saw passengers delayed and miss their ferries because contactless payments didn't work.\n\nCustomers said when they attempted to pay with contactless they 'were met with a big red cross'.\n\nThe declining use and acceptance of cash in Britain has been a controversial issue, with examples of attempts to dissuade people from using physical money.\n\nLast week, Barclays announced that from January customers will no longer be able to withdraw cash over the counter at Post Office branches, which are increasingly becoming de facto banks as the main high street names continue to shut branches.\n\nMeanwhile our sister title the Mail on Sunday recently reported on how Sheffield United football club's stadium Bramall Lane has gone fully cashless, following the likes of fellow Premier League clubs Tottenham Hotspur, Everton, Crystal Palace, Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers.", "description": "Ferry passengers incur the charge if they want to be dropped off or picked up by car, or park for the ferry at the end of the half-mile pier.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
