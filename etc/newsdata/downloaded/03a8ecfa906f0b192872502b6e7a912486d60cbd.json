'Our investigation concluded that the cause of Mr. Epstein\u2019s death was hanging and the manner of death was suicide. We stand by that determination. 'We continue to share information around the medical investigation with Mr. Epstein's family, their representatives, and their pathology consultant. The original medical investigation was thorough and complete. There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office.' New York City Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Barbara Sampson\n\nBaden - who has worked on cases involving OJ Simpson, President John F Kennedy, Phil Spector, Aaron Hernandez and more - said that the three fractures were 'rare'.\n\nThe 85-year-old forensic pioneer added: 'I've not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case.'\n\nHowever, New York City Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Barbara Sampson said Wednesday that she stands 'firmly' behind her findings and the autopsy puts any speculation about Epstein\u2019s death firmly to rest.\n\n'Our investigation concluded that the cause of Mr. Epstein\u2019s death was hanging and the manner of death was suicide. We stand by that determination,' Sampson said in a comment.\n\n'We continue to share information around the medical investigation with Mr. Epstein's family, their representatives, and their pathology consultant. The original medical investigation was thorough and complete. There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office.'\n\nIn retort, however, Baden insists Sampson could have \u2018made a mistake\u2019, insisting \u2018there's evidence here of homicide that should be investigated, to see if it is or isn't homicide.\u2019\n\nBaden described that a person weighing 120lbs - with a head wight of 10lbs - would have 110lbs of pressure on their neck at the jaw during a hanging. However, the pathologist described that double or triple the pressure could be applied to the neck if a person was to squeeze.\n\nBaden described how the 66-year-old financier had two fractures on the left and right sides of his larynx, around the Adam's apple\n\nBaden - who has worked on cases involving OJ Simpson, President John F Kennedy, Phil Spector and Aaron Hernandez - said that the three fractures were 'rare'\n\nBaden added that there were also hemorrhages in Epstein's eyes that were consistent in homicide strangulation yet uncommon - but not unheard of - in strangulation cases\n\nHe added that there were also hemorrhages in Epstein's eyes that were consistent in homicide strangulation yet uncommon - but not unheard of - in strangulation cases.\n\nBaden said: 'The prominent hemorrhage in the soft tissues of the neck next to the fractures is evidence of a fresh neck compression that could have caused the death.'\n\nThe pathologist asserted that a conclusion could not be reached until the independent study was completed.\n\n'The investigation is not completed until all the information has come in,' he said.\n\nA sheet that had been twisted was used as the ligature placed around Epstein's neck. Baden said that evidence on the cloth may provide insight into the details surrounding the sex offender's death at the Metropolitan Correctional facility.\n\n'Whoever it is would have their DNA all over the ligature,' he said. 'We don't have those results yet.'\n\nBaden declared that the results 'should be reported quickly to give an idea and lessen the speculation'.\n\nBaden shared that Epstein's brother and family wanted answers, prompting his hiring. 'The brother is concerned that if he was murdered, then other people who have information might be as risk, in jeopardy,' he said\n\nThe pathologist asserted that a conclusion could not be reached until the independent study into Epstein's death was completed. Pictured above a scene picture from August when Epstein's body was brought out by medical examiners at a lower Manhattan hospital and taken to the Medical Examiners office\n\nBaden noted that Epstein had been placed on suicide watch after he was found on the floor of his prison cell on July 23 with marks around his neck.\n\nAfter being taken off of suicide watch, he was placed in a cell with a roommate who was eventually removed.\n\nAnd on the day of his death, Baden described that there was a 'total breakdown' in procedure experienced by prison security.\n\n'It was determined that the two guards who were supposed to be working in that area of the prison had allegedly fallen asleep and hadn't made their 30-minute rounds for more than 3 hours,' the pathologist explained.\n\nSecurity cameras in the facility were also compromised, Baden said.\n\nQuestions remain as to why the high-profile pedophile was taken off suicide watch so soon after this July suicide attempt, and why he was not being properly monitored by MCC employees at the time of his death\n\nBaden shared that Epstein's brother and family wanted answers, prompting his hiring. He added that if the death was a homicide, 'he and others may be at risk because of somebody not wanting knowledge given out.'\n\n'The brother is concerned that if he was murdered, then other people who have information might be as risk, in jeopardy,' he said.\n\nThe forensic mainstay described Epstein's death as 'not a typical hanging case.\n\nQuestions remain as to why the high-profile pedophile was taken off suicide watch so soon after this July suicide attempt, and why he was not being properly monitored by MCC employees at the time of his death.\n\nHis death prompted outrage and disbelief over how such a high-profile prisoner, known for socializing with powerful people including presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton, could have been left without surveillance at the federal facility.\n\nEpstein was awaiting sex trafficking charges.", "description": "Dr Michael Baden shared his suspicions over the nature of Jeffrey Epstein's death in a bombshell interview with Fox on Wednesday, suggesting the sex offender's body bore signs of homicide.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com", "Matthew Wright For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/22/20399352-0-image-a-25_1572473814170.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
