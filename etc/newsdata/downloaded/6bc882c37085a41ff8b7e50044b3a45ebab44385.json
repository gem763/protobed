It\u2019s ending with Kim Kardashian West publicly praising the president for his efforts on The View.\n\nKardashian\u2019s Friday morning sit-down with The View hosts started off very light, with a discussion about raising four kids while her husband Kanye West is on a \u201cno help kick,\u201d meaning no nannies. \u201cA house of four is wild,\u201d she said. \u201cBut complete. Very balanced, complete.\u201d When Joy Behar asked her if that means \u201cno more,\u201d Kardashian replied, \u201cThat means absolutely no more.\u201d\n\nBut soon, the conversation turned towards Kardashian\u2019s newfound interest in prison reform, including her plans to become a lawyer without taking the typical law school route and the meeting she had at the White House with Trump leading up to the passage of the First Step Act.\n\n\u201cYou got a lot of heat from a lot of people,\u201d Meghan McCain noted before stressing that she believes in \u201cbipartisanship on a basic level\u201d and thinks \u201cwe\u2019re not going to get anything done unless we\u2019re listening to two different voices.\u201d She asked their guest, \u201cWere you worried about any backlash you were going to get because you did this bill with President Trump?\u201d\n\n\u201cI definitely was aware,\u201d Kardashian answered carefully. \u201cBut for me any of my issues have always been more about the people and not about the politics. And so for me to think that I couldn\u2019t go and speak to the man that has the power to change people's lives because of some opinions I may have of certain policies and issues, to me felt very self-centered.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I was more worried about my reputation than saving someone\u2019s life,\u201d she continued, referring to Alice Marie Johnson, who ultimately had her life sentence commuted by the president. \u201cAnd so I put that all out the door, and I thought, you know what? I'm going to choose her over my reputation.\u201d\n\nAfter McCain commended the \u201camazing work\u201d she\u2019s doing, Kardashian made a point to give Trump credit directly, lest he decide she deserves a nasty tweet as well.\n\n\u201cI felt like I had an open opportunity to do that,\u201d she said, \u201cand from the president going from being really harsh on his stance on prison reform to changing and actually signing the First Step Act and getting that bill passed, was amazing.\u201d", "description": "The reality star\u2019s comments come after the president accused celebrities John Legend and Chrissy Teigen of not giving him proper credit for passing the First Step Act.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1438,w_2556,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568392463/KK_seinjf", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
