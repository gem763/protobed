Sign up for this newsletter here.\n\nAt The White House\n\nTRUMP GOES THERE: White House counsel Pat Cipollone laid down the gauntlet yesterday on behalf of President Trump, announcing the White House will not cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry. It was a bellicose move that seemingly bets Trump's odds of being impeached on the court of public opinion and the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nCipollone's eight-page letter to House Democratic leaders called the impeachment probe \u201ca partisan and unconstitutional inquiry\u201d and an attempt by Democrats to \u201coverturn the democratic process.\u201d It was rebuked by Democratic lawmakers and legal experts alike as a political document that packs little legal punch.\n\n\u201cI've read the constitution a number of times and am having a hard time remembering where in the constitution it says that there has to be any formal vote by committee or by the Congress or the [House] to commence an investigation whether it might lead to or be motivated by the possibility of an impeachment,\u201d Jack Quinn, the former White House counsel for Bill Clinton, told Power Up. \u201cThe problem for the White House is that there really is no appealing the process of impeachment the House uses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm really surprised Pat Cipollone put his name on this letter,\u201d Quinn added, referring to the flat White House refusal to provide any more witnesses or records.\n\nQuinn added, referring to the flat White House refusal to provide any more witnesses or records. Not just Democrats: \u201cWow. This letter is bananas,\u201d Gregg Nunziata, Sen. Marco Rubio's (R-Fla.) former general counsel tweeted. \u201cA barely-lawyered temper tantrum. A middle finger to Congress and its oversight responsibilities. No Member of Congress should accept it, no matter his or her view on the behavior of Pelosi, [Adam] Schiff, or Trump. Things are bad. Things will get worse.\u201d\n\nNot happening: There is no requirement that the House vote to open a formal impeachment inquiry, as the letter demands. And Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) appears unlikely to be swayed.\n\n\u201cThe lengthy letter all but dares [Pelosi] to hold a formal vote opening an impeachment inquiry into Trump, though it does not explicitly call on her to do so,\u201d CNN's Jeremy Herb, Manu Raju, and Pamela Brown report. \u201cBut Pelosi has said that Democrats don't need to take a vote and has shown little interest in doing so after she announced last month the House would open an impeachment inquiry, accusing the White House of trying to play politics and arguing that House rules don't require a vote.\u201d\n\nCaveat: Nonetheless, Trump's decision highlighted \u201cthe limitations of Democrats\u2019 ability to exercise their oversight authority of an administration that appears unfazed by flouting subpoenas,\u201d per our colleagues Karoun Demirjian, Josh Dawsey, Shane Harris and John Wagner.\n\nBolstering their case: Pelosi said in a statement the White House failure to comply \u201cis only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the President is above the law.\"\n\nAnd she warned the lack of cooperation could be used as evidence for an article of impeachment. \u201cDespite the White House\u2019s stonewalling, we see a growing body of evidence that shows that President Trump abused his office and violated his oath to \u2018protect, preserve and defend the Constitution.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction,\u201d Pelosi wrote.\n\nNow can we call it a constitutional crisis? \u2014 Brian Schatz (@brianschatz) October 9, 2019\n\nSHOT: Cipollone's letter argues the current impeachment inquiry is invalid because it diverges from precedents set during previous impeachment inquiries.\n\nCHASER: The White House is correct in asserting that a formal floor vote preceded impeachment inquiries into Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. But such a step is not constitutionally required. We should also point out that the House voted to impeach President Andrew Johnson before it established a special committee and voted on formal articles.\n\nAnd in a background call with reporters as the letter was released, a senior administration official refused to specify what conditions are necessary for the White House to cooperate with congressional investigators.\n\n\u201cI don't want to speculate about what would happen in various hypothetical situations,\u201d the senior administration official said. \u201cIf the House wants to engage and alter the current circumstances, then we'll have to evaluate that as it goes along.\u201d\n\nPhil Schiliro, who is currently advising Democrats on their approach to investigations of the Trump administration, called the legal merits of the letter \u201cas good for holding water as a colander: It\u2019s a frivolous position that would mean a President acting illegally would be accountable to no one. That\u2019s the opposite of what the founders of our country designed and has no precedent in our history,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nSchiliro, the former director of legislative affairs under President Obama and a former staff director of the House Oversight Committee, also pointed to the past:\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago Rep Dan Burton, as Chair of the House Oversight Committee, issued 1,052 unilateral subpoenas over six years to the Clinton Administration and the Democratic Party. No matter how unreasonable many of those subpoenas were, either the information was provided or a compromise reached. Every previous Administration has recognized the legitimate and constitutional role Congress has in oversight. This Administration is asserting a radical legal position based on nothing.\u201d\n\nSome argued the bold White House move could ultimately prove a major misstep.\n\n\u201cA lot of people who will wonder: why is the White House refusing to provide evidence -- what are they hiding?\" Quinn told Power Up. \u201cEnough people will be wondering why the president refuses to rebut what is being said. And if more whistl blowers come forward than it could go downhill fast.\"\n\n\u201cEnough people will be wondering why the president refuses to rebut what is being said. And if more whistl blowers come forward than it could go downhill fast.\" \u201cRemember what happened with Nixon: his Republican party stayed with him until it didn\u2019t and it didn\u2019t when public opinion turned,\" Quinn added.\n\nReminder: We detailed our latest Washington Post-Schar school poll out yesterday showing that 58 percent of voters favor the impeachment process, including 57 percent of independents.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge seemed baffled by the Justice Department's position the House Judiciary Committee should be denied materials from Robert Mueller's grand jury investigation -- because courts were wrong to provide grand jury information surrounding Nixon.\n\n\u201cWow, okay,\u201d Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of Washington responded, sounding unpersuaded. \u201cAs I said, the department is taking extraordinary positions in this case,\" reports our colleague Spencer S. Hsu.\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo excoriated China on Twitter for its actions.\n\nChina has forcibly detained over one million Muslims in a brutal, systematic campaign to erase religion and culture in Xinjiang.

Marimow report.\n\nBackground: \u201cThe issue, one of the most significant facing the court this term, concerns the reach of \u00adTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which, besides protecting against workplace discrimination because of race, religion and other characteristics, also prohibits discrimination 'because of sex,'\" our colleagues write. \u201cThe court has since interpreted that definition to include discriminating on the basis of sex stereotypes.\u201d\n\nInside the court: \u201cLawyers for the gay and transgender individuals challenging their firings seemed to pitch their arguments to Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, a conservative who advocates a close textual reading of statutes,\u201d our colleagues write. \u201cThere seemed little doubt that the court\u2019s four liberal members would find that Title VII covered gay and transgender workers. But one of the court\u2019s five conservatives would have to join them to form a majority.\u201d\n\nNeil Gorsuch mused: The justice \"wondered if 'when a case is really close, courts should make decisions that might cause 'massive social upheaval' rather than leave it up to Congress.\u201d\n\nThe justice \"wondered if 'when a case is really close, courts should make decisions that might cause 'massive social upheaval' rather than leave it up to Congress.\u201d Brett Kavanaugh kept a low profile: He asked only one question.\n\nHe asked only one question.
