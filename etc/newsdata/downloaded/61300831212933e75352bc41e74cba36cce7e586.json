(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThere is no shortage of praise or accolades for Arlington Public Schools. Students in the suburban D.C. school system outperform their peers on state tests. Most high school students graduate with advanced diplomas. The district spends nearly $20,500 per student, more than any other district in a region flush with well-heeled public schools.\n\nIt\u2019s the best school system in Virginia, according to the most recent standings on the ranking website Niche.\n\nBut a growing chorus of black parents in the 27,500-student school system is disrupting the narrative \u2014 the school system is excellent, they say, for wealthy, able-bodied white students and less so for everyone else.\n\n[\u2018Growing sense of despair\u2019: A wealthy, diversifying school system in suburban D.C. confronts racism and hate in schools]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly not excellent for black kids,\u201d said Whytni Kernodle, a parent with two students in the system. She is also vice president of Black Parents of Arlington, which began as a social group but has more recently evolved into an advocacy organization.\n\nThat group and the Arlington NAACP\u2019s reinvigorated education committee are pressuring the school system to take seriously issues that have endured since well before today\u2019s schoolchildren were born.\n\n\n\nFrom left: LuQman-Dawson, Kernodle, Williams, Worthey and Kerns. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThe parents\u2019 demands are not new, recurring in similar battles over equal access to educational opportunities across the country. Among their goals: mandatory implicit bias training for teachers, more teachers of color, movement on closing achievement or opportunity gaps, and addressing discipline disparities.\n\nInterim superintendent Cintia Johnson said the school system has long been committed to remedying the concerns that Black Parents of Arlington has raised, and she highlighted training and other efforts the school system has undertaken to tackle the issues parents have highlighted.\n\n\u201cArlington recognizes that this is important work,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI welcome the opportunity to really work with groups, as we do throughout this county, in an effort to continue to improve and move forward.\u201d\n\nThe school system is hiring a chief diversity officer and has bolstered cultural competency training opportunities for school system employees. Last year, the district began a program called the Black Parent Alliance, which provides workshops and other resources for parents.\n\nAnd the Arlington school system commissioned a study that assessed diversity in the school system, and examined the district\u2019s curriculum and policies. A report published in March found that there is a \u201ctremendous amount of optimism\u201d about the capacity for more inclusion and diversity in the school system.\n\nBut the report also found that issues of diversity, inclusion and equity are inconsistently prioritized and valued at campuses across the system.\n\nMembers of the Black Parents of Arlington argue that the school system must do more to make good on its promises to address disparities.\n\nThey point to data that show in the 2017-2018 school year, 93 percent of white students in Arlington schools passed state Standards of Learning tests in math compared with 71 percent of black students. White students posted a 95 percent passing rate on reading exams, while 73 percent of their black peers passed.\n\nBlack Parents of Arlington has written letters laying out its mission. The group has circulated a brochure illustrating the gaps in scores between black and white students on state math and reading tests.\n\n[Arlington school system signs agreement to improve support for English learners]\n\nIt wants to unite the black population in Arlington \u2014 a diverse community that includes African immigrants who may face language or other barriers, as well as longtime residents with deep political and social connections in the county.\n\nIt has also been subjected to backlash in online comments from community members who have drawn on stereotypes to undermine the group\u2019s work.\n\nParents say that is indicative of how Arlington \u2014 a largely liberal county with a school system that has positioned itself at the forefront of issues such as rights for transgender students \u2014 has blind spots when it comes to race.\n\n\u201cArlington is more progressive, probably, than anyplace else in the state. But that doesn\u2019t make it good enough, and it doesn\u2019t make it as progressive as it wants to be,\u201d Kernodle said. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is force a group of progressive people to put their money where their mouth is.\u201d\n\nIn the seventh grade, Kernodle\u2019s oldest son received a letter saying he was nominated for a college preparation program at George Mason University based on his academic achievement. The mother was thrilled \u2014 until she reached the third paragraph.\n\nThe program was for children who would be the first in their family to attend college. But her son would not be a first-generation college student \u2014 Kernodle has a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania and her husband has an MBA from Dartmouth College.\n\nThe mother went to school system officials, pressing them to explain how her son was chosen to receive the letter. School system officials acted quickly to address Kernodle\u2019s concerns, she said.\n\nStill, she thought her son received the letter as a result of a microaggression and implicit bias \u2014 that an employee at her son\u2019s Arlington middle school saw a black child and assumed that his parents did not attend college.\n\n\u201cWho is seeing my child as he walks around and just assumes that this is another uneducated black boy?\u201d she said. \u201cThe assumption was that we were not educated.\u201d\n\nSchool system officials declined to comment about the experiences of individual students. But spokeswoman Catherine Ashby said the school system is committed to providing \u201ca variety of resources and opportunities for all students to achieve excellence based on their individual academic needs, goals and interests.\u201d\n\nFamilies, she said, have \u201cmany points of contact\u201d to teams of administrators, staff, counselors and other specialists that can help students access support and resources they need.\n\nAnother parent, Alfiee Breland-Noble, said her son was never referred by teachers for gifted services at Tuckahoe Elementary School, where 80 percent of students are white, despite receiving straight A\u2019s.\n\n[A Virginia high school that honored a Confederate general gets a new name: Washington-Liberty]\n\nShe eventually submitted forms referring her son and daughter for gifted services at Tuckahoe. Both were denied, said Breland-Noble, who is not affiliated with Black Parents of Arlington.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Breland-Noble\u2019s son transferred to Glebe Elementary, a more racially diverse school, that she said a teacher nominated her son for gifted services. She felt that teachers at the school were more adept at addressing issues related to inclusiveness and diversity.\n\nBreland-Noble belonged to the school system\u2019s advisory committee on gifted services and said she thinks black and Latino parents must advocate for access to advanced programs for their children in ways that white parents do not.\n\nIt\u2019s troubling, she said, because gifted programs provide a gateway to more advanced classes, to newsletters with information about summer camps devoted to science, technology, engineering and math, and classes that prepare students for the SAT.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re identified as a gifted and talented kid, it opens up a whole world of opportunity,\u201d she said.\n\nForty percent of white high school students in Arlington were identified for gifted services in 2017-2018, school system data show, compared with 16 percent of black students.\n\nCarolyn Jackson, the system\u2019s equity and excellence supervisor, said some of these issues stem from an \u201cinformation gap\u201d in which parents are unaware of resources or lack knowledge about processes, such as the requirements needed to qualify for advanced courses.\n\n\u201cWe really do need to examine the information gap,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe have to be more intentional on how to explain and have parents and students understand the requirements to get into some of those programs.\u201d\n\nBlack Parents of Arlington has sought to bring attention to this stark divide, along with discipline disparities that show black students are suspended at much higher rates than white students at some schools.\n\nFederal data show that in 2015, black students accounted for 29 percent of Arlington\u2019s in-school suspensions while making up 11 percent of the school population. Hispanic students made up 41 percent of suspensions but were just 28 percent of the population.\n\nThe Arlington NAACP\u2019s recently revitalized education committee has begun to delve into the same issues that galvanized Black Parents of Arlington. Symone Walker, a co-chair on the NAACP committee, said she chose to join the organization at the beginning of the year after becoming inspired by the work done by a neighboring NAACP chapter.\n\nA parent of two middle school students, Walker said she has noticed over the years that \u201cblack students in Arlington seem to be falling behind.\u201d She was disheartened to hear about a cost-saving proposal from former superintendent Patrick Murphy that would have cut equity coordinator positions in high schools.\n\nThe jobs were spared, but Walker said that watching students lobby to keep the positions \u201ctouched my core.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the 10 years I\u2019ve been here, I don\u2019t recall a budget season in Arlington that directly impacted students of color the way this one did, or would have if it wasn\u2019t fixed,\u201d Walker said.\n\nSeveral parents said they think their children are receiving high-quality educations. But the community has resisted conversations about systemic problems, they said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear out there that no one really wants to talk substantively about racial inequity. It makes everyone uncomfortable,\u201d said Amina Luqman-Dawson, a founder of Black Parents of Arlington. \u201cIn reality, we have maybe never really sat down and actually worked through the problem.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nVa. high school students assail new school boundary plan\n\nArlington school system signs agreement to improve support for English learners\n\nA Virginia high school that honored a Confederate general gets a new name: Washington-Liberty\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The county system is excellent, they say, for wealthy, able-bodied white children.
