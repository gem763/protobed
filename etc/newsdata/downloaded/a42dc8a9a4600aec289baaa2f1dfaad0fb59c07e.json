Siamraptor suwati was a 26-feet long predatory dinosaur that lived in what is now Thailand. It dates back to the Early Cretaceous period, which lasted from 146\u2013100 million years ago. It was a predator and a member of a group of dinosaurs known as the carcharodontosaurians. Siamraptor suwati is also the first definitive carcharodontosaurian fossil found in Southeast Asia. Researchers found fossil remains from four different individuals.\n\nPalaeontologists Duangsuda Chokchaloemwong of the Nakhon Ratchasima Rajabhat University analysed the fossilised remains, which were found in the Thai province of Nakhon Ratchasima.\n\nThe researchers have dated the dinosaur skeleton back to the Early Cretaceous period, which lasted from 146\u2013100 million years ago.\n\nAmong the fossilised bones the team identify the remains of the creature's skull, backbone, hips and limbs believed to belong to four individual dinosaurs.\n\nBy comparing the features of the fossil with known dinosaurs, the researchers have been able to identify the remains as belonging to a previously-unknown species of carcharodontosaurian.\n\nThese were a successful and widespread group of sizeable predatory dinosaurs that lived during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.\n\nThe team have named the new species Siamraptor suwati, in honour of both Thailand and Mr Suwat Liptapanlop, a benefactor of the research.\n\nThe researchers believe that S. suwati evolved and diverged from the other members of the carcharodontosaur group early in their history.\n\nThe 26 feet (8 metres) -long behemoth is a new, early member of a successful and widespread group of dinosaurs called the Carcharodontosaurids\n\nThe remains \u2014 which belonged to four individuals of the new species, dubbed Siamraptor suwati \u2014 included skull, backbone and hip fossils.
