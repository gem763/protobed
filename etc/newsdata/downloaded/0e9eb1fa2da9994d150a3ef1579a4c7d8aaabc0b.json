I just couldn\u2019t get my positivity back.\u2019\n\nEmma was gutted at the thought of missing the Wolf Run \u2013 a quarterly event that she hasn\u2019t missed since 2014. So she was willing to try anything to get through the course \u2013 even with her dodgy ankle.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so glad I did it. It was an amazing day and I had an incredible sense of achievement\u2019 (Picture: Peachysnaps)\n\n\u2018If you complete four Wolf Runs in a year, one in each season, you get Alpha Wolf status,\u2019 explains Emma. \u2018This year was going to be my fifth in a row as an Alpha Wolf and I was really upset that I\u2019d lose my status.\n\n\u2018I was telling my friend that I was going to cancel, and he persuaded me to give it a go. Having something to aim for really kept me going.\u2019\n\nEmma completed the run wearing an iWALK2.0, which is a special hands-free crutch that enables people with lower leg injuries or illnesses to stay mobile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a medically-approved device and it basically functions like a hi-tech peg-leg, allowing users to walk freely and reclaim the use of their arms and hands.\n\n\u2018A friend of mine is an amputee and he\u2019s used the special crutch before. I decided to get one and it completely changed my recovery. And it had a real impact on my mental well-being.\u2019\n\nOn the day of the race, Emma was nervous but the sound of people cheering her on kept her motivated.\n\n\u2018Having something to aim for really kept me going\u2019 (Picture: Emma Tysoe)\n\n\u2018I took each obstacle as it came and I loved it, we had such a good laugh,\u2019 she says. \u2018I brought a speaker with me so we could listen to music as I knew it would take a while to get round. It was hard going uphill and navigating ropes but I just kept going.\u2019\n\nAgainst the odds, Emma made it over the finish line in just under six hours and clocked up her 23rd Wolf Run in five years.\n\n\u2018It was an incredible day and my determination to finish combined with the support I received along the way kept me going,\u2019 says Emma.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so glad I did it. It was an amazing day and I had an incredible sense of achievement. It was just what I needed to boost myself back up mentally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You\u2019re almost back to normal when you\u2019re wearing the crutch, you\u2019ve got the use of your legs back and you can just get on with and enjoy your life.\u2019\n\nThe iWALK2.0 was first invented by a Canadian farmer who broke his foot but still needed to work. He was annoyed that there weren\u2019t any better alternatives to crutches, so he took to his workshop and built something for himself.\n\nMORE: How I Save: The 24-year-old blogger and consultant with \u00a375,000 saved\n\nMORE: Mum creates Harry Potter themed bedroom for her son for \u00a3150\n\nMORE: Your pet could earn \u00a350 an hour by comforting people with anxiety\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A bad ankle injury left Emma house-bound - but with the help of a 'pirate leg' crutch, she was able to get back to doing what she loves.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/10k-comp_1571303761.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
