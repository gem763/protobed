As part of a cooperation agreement, prosecutors promised to request a reduced sentence. Given the extent of his assistance, it\u2019s possible he could be released as early as next year, according to his attorney, Lance Lazzaro.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office prosecuting him has also indicated Hernandez could enter the witness protection program after serving his sentence. Whether the Brooklyn native plans to accept the offer is unclear. But it raises questions about how a viral celebrity successfully vanishes from view \u2014 and whether he would even want to.\n\nTekashi 6ix9ine rose to fame as a rapper and gang member. Now he\u2019s exiled as a \u2018snitch.\u2019\n\nSince its inception in 1971, the Witness Security Program has served more than 8,600 witnesses, according to the U.S. Marshals Service, which administers the program; as of this year, the program has assisted some 18,900 people, including both witnesses and family members.\n\nThe federal Witness Security Program was created by the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 and designed to provide protection before, during and after trials for people who were in danger because they provided testimony against high-ranking mafia members.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPeople inside a criminal enterprise were often able to intimidate others who might have cooperated with authorities into silence. By entering the program, witnesses and their families were assured new identities and full documentation, housing, living and medical expenses, and assistance finding a job.\n\nThe witness protection program has since been expanded to include people who testify in drug trafficking cases, federal and state felony cases that could result in retaliation against the witness, and some civil and administrative proceedings.\n\nIn its early years, the program was riddled with problems, from soft security to unfulfilled promises.\n\nWhen Ron Schoenneman joined the program in 1972, he agreed to cooperate with the federal government against his former business partner, who he suspected was double-crossing him. The duo\u2019s operation involved $9 million in profits from stolen tractor-trailers, The Washington Post reported.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSchoenneman, his wife and six children were dropped off at a motel in the Midwest with new names and little else. They were not given identification, money or employment. The government also refused to pay for Schoenneman\u2019s daughter\u2019s medical condition, and despite his cooperation, Schoenneman was sentenced to five years in prison in 1975.\n\n6ix9ine arrested on racketeering and firearms charges; prosecutors say the troubled rapper was part of a violent gang\n\nHoward Safir, who led the protection effort in the late 1970s and early 1980s as assistant director of operations for the Marshals Service, called it a \u201cproblem program,\u201d according to The Washington Post. He said it was in part because over 90 percent of its participants were hardened criminals who were trying to escape either retribution or lengthy prison terms.\n\nOver time, the program began operating more smoothly. A 1989 Marshals Service report called it \u201cthe government\u2019s most effective way to obtain testimony against accused drug dealers, major organized crime members and terrorists.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn recent years, the Marshals Service has relocated many participants, including high-profile witnesses. According to the agency, not a single person has been hurt or killed while under its protection.\n\nWith changed haircuts, clothes and names, the witnesses who had been under threat have adopted unassuming identities and blended into their new neighborhoods without issue.\n\nThe caveat, though, is that they wanted the government\u2019s help in disappearing, and Hernandez might not. He\u2019s even signaled a desire to reactivate his hip-hop career \u2014 something that would prove difficult with a new identity.\n\nLazzaro, his lawyer, declined to comment on Hernandez\u2019s decision until his sentencing, which is scheduled for December.\n\nAD\n\nHernandez\u2019s rainbow-colored hair will fade. His prominent face tattoos pose difficult (though not impossible) challenges. Yet possibly the greatest threat to his successful protection is that he\u2019s a self-described troll who revels in the public eye and thrives on attention.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhen Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine resigned, a student newspaper beat everyone to the story\n\nWith a brass band blaring, artist Kehinde Wiley goes off to war with Confederate statues\n\nLet\u2019s try to explain Trump\u2019s baffling tweet about Adam Schiff and hyphens\n\nAD", "description": "The U.S. attorney\u2019s office prosecuting him indicated Tekashi 6ix9ine could enter the witness protection program after serving his sentence.
