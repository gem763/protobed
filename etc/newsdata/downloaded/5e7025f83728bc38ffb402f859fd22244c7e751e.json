I'm so pleased to tell you all... I\u2019m expecting my first child with my wonderful boyfriend Adrian!!\" she told her fans.\n\n\"I've always wanted to be a mum and didn't think I could have children.

We couldn't be happier.\"\n\nShe accidentally gave away the sex of her unborn baby during an appearance on ITV's Lorraine.\n\nHost Lorraine asked her to return to the morning show when the baby arrived.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nAs Hayley agreed, she said: \"I'll bring him\u2026 or her...I think I just gave away what it is.\"\n\nThe pair laughed off the moment, as viewers congratulated the mum-to-be on Twitter .\n\nHayley also opened up about her heartbreaking fertility battles and how, at the age of 40, she had been trying to make peace with not being a mum.\n\n\"I found myself single and I'm 40 years old thinking, \u2018Well that\u2019s my time gone. Be ok with it,\" she said.\n\n\"I've read there's only a five percent chance after 40, per month, that a woman can get pregnant and the risk of miscarriage increases massively.\n\n\"Sadly we did go through that, but what that taught me was I could get pregnant, I can do it.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHayley said she'd had trouble with her ovaries since she was a teenager, and had been plagued by ovarian cysts throughout her adult lfie.\n\nShe said her mum had similar problems conceiving, revealing it had taken her parents seven years before she arrived.\n\nHayley and Adrian, who grew up on the same street but didn't get together until 2017, even discussed adoption as she knew how desperate he was to be a dad.\n\n\"I said, 'Look, I can't have kids, I don't think it's going to happen for me. He said, 'That's OK, maybe we could adopt in the future?' And I thought, 'Yes we could'. Again, I thought it won't happen.\"\n\nHayley recently joined up with her former co-stars Julia Goulding and Brooke Vincent for a relaxing spa day as they all got pregnant at the same time.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nThe trio proudly compared their swimwear-clad bumps at The Garden Spa in Warrington on their day out.\n\n\"Mummy's to be having a spa day at the garden spa in Warrington .. proudly showing off our baby bumps.

I'm doing everything that I love to do. My family are very proud of me,\" she said at the time.\n\n\"My body feels 37 but I still feel 21. I sometimes forget that I'm going to be 40. It would be lovely to have kids in the future but for now my main \u00adconcentration is my work.\"\n\nShe went on: \"I'm not scared of nappies or screaming babies but I'm just not at that point.\n\n\"Not many of my friends have settled down either. I'm a workaholic. It's always work, work, work, I can't switch it off.\"\n\nCongratulations, Hayley and Adrian!", "description": "Soap star Hayley Tamaddon has welcomed her first baby with fiance Adrian at the age of 42", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Andy Barnes", "Backgrid", "Instagram", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20575534.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_hayleysoraya_71188567_2507252149390036_2956878072791508502_n.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
