Then the Browns cut him.\n\nFrom there, Osweiler went back to the Broncos and started a handful of games, going 0-4, before moving onto the Dolphins the following season and going 2-3 as a starter.\n\nIn a league where quarterbacks are completing more passes and compiling more yards than ever before, the 28-year-old finishes his career with a completion percentage below 60 percent and less than 7,500 passing yards with 57 yards and 31 interceptions.\n\nHowever, Osweiler also finished with more than $41 million in career earnings, according to Spotrac. For a guy who only started 30 games and went 15-15, that\u2019s a pretty great haul.\n\nIn the NFL, retired quarterback Sam Bradford is notorious for paychecks that far exceeded his production as he ended up making about $1.44 million per game on average and walked away with more than $130 million in total for 83 career starts (34-48-1).\n\nThough Osweiler doesn\u2019t live up to Bradford in total money, he nearly equals him on a per-game basis with an average salary of close to $1.36 million per start. Considering he only won half of his games, that figure is downright ridiculous and may make Osweiler the worst deal in the history of the NFL (besides Bradford).\n\nHe sounds like a nice guy though.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely grateful for the time I did receive playing in the National Football League,\u2019\u2019 Osweiler said in an interview with 9News. \u201cThe experiences I did have, people I did meet, relationships I did make \u2014 I\u2019m not going to dwell on the things that didn\u2019t happen in my career. Being a kid from Kalispell, Montana, playing for the Denver Broncos, winning a Super Bowl, having the opportunity to sign a second contract \u2013 when you look back on it, I couldn\u2019t be more appreciative.\u201d\n\nHard not to appreciate $40 million for 30 weeks of work.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.", "description": "At 6-7 and 240 pounds, quarterback Brock Osweiler made for an imposing figure on the football field after being drafted in the second round in 2012.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1063894252.jpg?fit=1024%2C683", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
