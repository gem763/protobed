Who\u2019s to Blame?", "language": "en", "text": "A former employee of Huntington Ingalls Industries, the Virginia-based shipbuilder that helps to construct all of the U.S. Navy\u2019s submarines, has sued the company in federal court, claiming that the firm lied about problems with the external coating on Virginia-class attack subs.\n\nAri Lawrence, a former HII engineer, claimed he was fired for raising his concerns about the \u201canechoic\u201d hull coating, which adheres to a submarine\u2019s metal hull and helps to absorb sound waves, thus minimizing the vessel\u2019s sonar signature.\n\nVirginia-class subs since at least 2006 have suffered problems with their coatings. Official photos have depicted submarines entering and leaving port with noticeable gaps in their coatings, implying that chunks of the sound-absorbing material had peeled off.\n\nLawrence claimed HII falsified testing, inspection results and certifications related to the coatings.\n\nThe company will vigorously fight the charges, Jennifer Boykin, president of HII\u2019s Newport News Shipbuilding division, told the Hampton Roads Daily Press newspaper. She told Daily Press that the U.S. Justice Department looked at Lawrence\u2019s claims and declined to join the case.\n\nNaval consultant Craig Hooper weighed in with comments to Daily Press. \u201cIt\u2019s one of these things where it seems deceptively simple,\u201d Hooper said of the coatings. \u201cBut it has a lot of variables.\u201d\n\nLosing sound-absorbing materials is a common problem for operators of deep-diving submarines, Forbes reported. \u201cSubmarines are made out of immensely strong steel, but when they go deep the water pressure makes their hulls flex and change shape.\u201d\n\nThis places the adhesive behind the coating under immense strains. Add to this the long patrols, unforgiving salt water, rust and temperature changes involved and you have one of the most challenging operating environments on earth. So when you next see a submarine with tiles missing and rust stains, it may tell you more about the way it is being used than the maintenance standards of its owners.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "A former employee of Huntington Ingalls Industries, the Virginia-based shipbuilder that helps to construct all of the U.S. Navy\u2019s submarines, has sued the company in federal court, claiming that the firm lied about problems with the external coating on Virginia-class attack subs.", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BHE.h.pUxxUjCYOD6MmmHQ--~B/aD05MDI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/339d3f89fcf244b88c35d70e3a43c389", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
