But if you harness your anxious temperament correctly, it might make you a better worker. Jerome Kagan says he hires only people with high-reactive temperaments as research assistants. \u201cThey\u2019re compulsive, they don\u2019t make errors,\u201d he told The New York Times. Other research supports Kagan\u2019s observation. A 2013 study in the Academy of Management Journal, for instance, found that neurotics contribute more to group projects than co-workers predict, while extroverts contribute less. And in 2005, researchers in the United Kingdom published a paper, \u201cCan Worriers Be Winners?,\u201d reporting that financial managers high in anxiety tended to be the best, most effective money managers, as long as their worrying was accompanied by a high IQ.\n\nUnfortunately, the positive correlation between worrying and job performance disappeared when the worriers had a low IQ. But some evidence suggests that excessive worrying is itself allied to intelligence. Jeremy Coplan, the lead author of one study supporting that thesis, says anxiety is evolutionarily adaptive because \u201cevery so often there\u2019s a wild-card danger.\u201d When such a danger arises, anxious people are more likely to be prepared to survive. Coplan, a professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, has said that worrying can be a good trait in leaders\u2014and that lack of worrying can be dangerous. If people in leadership positions are \u201cincapable of seeing any danger, even when danger is imminent,\u201d they are likely, among other poor decisions, to \u201cindicate to the general populace that there\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d (Some commentators have suggested, based on findings like Coplan\u2019s, that the main cause of the economic crash of 2008 was politicians and financiers who were either stupid or insufficiently anxious or both.) Studies on rhesus monkeys by Stephen Suomi, the chief of the Laboratory of Comparative Ethology at the National Institutes of Health, have found that when monkeys genetically predisposed to anxiety were taken early in life from their anxious mothers and given to unanxious mothers to be raised, a fascinating thing happened: these monkeys grew up to display less anxiety than peers with the same genetic markings\u2014and many also, intriguingly, became the leader of their troop. This suggests that, under the right circumstances, some quotient of anxiety can equip you to be a leader.\n\nAs always, all of this comes with the proviso that anxiety is productive mainly when it is not so strong as to be debilitating. But if you are anxious, perhaps you can take heart from these findings.\n\nI\u2019ve come to understand that my own nervous disposition is perhaps an essential part of my being\u2014and not just in ways that are bad. \u201cI hate your anxiety,\u201d my wife once said, \u201cand I hate that it makes you unhappy. But what if there are things that I love about you that are connected to your anxiety?\n\n\u201cWhat if,\u201d she asked, getting to the heart of the matter, \u201cyou\u2019re cured of your anxiety and you become a total jerk?\u201d\n\nI suspect I might. Military pilots, by reputation, at least, are famously unanxious. And one small-scale study from the 1980s found that nine out of 10 separations and divorces among Air Force pilots were initiated by wives. Perhaps the two are linked. Low baseline levels of autonomic arousal (which can correspond to low levels of anxiety) have been tied not only to a need for adventure (flying a fighter plane, say), but also to a certain interpersonal obtuseness, a lack of sensitivity to social cues. It may be that my anxiety lends me an inhibition and a social sensitivity that make me more attuned to other people and a more tolerable spouse than I otherwise would be.\n\nThe notion of a connection between anxiety and morality long predates the findings of modern science or my wife\u2019s intuition. Saint Augustine believed fear is adaptive because it helps people behave morally. The novelist Angela Carter has called anxiety \u201cthe beginning of conscience.\u201d Some research into the determinants of criminal behavior suggest that criminals tend to be lower in anxiety than noncriminals. (On the other hand, different studies have found that high levels of anxiety, especially in youth, correlate with delinquent behavior.)\n\nMy anxiety can be intolerable. But it is also, maybe, a gift\u2014or at least the other side of a coin I ought to think twice about before trading in. As often as anxiety has held me back\u2014prevented me from traveling, or from seizing opportunities or taking certain risks\u2014it has also unquestionably spurred me forward. \u201cIf a man were a beast or an angel, he would not be able to be in anxiety,\u201d S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard wrote in 1844. \u201cSince he is a synthesis, he can be in anxiety, and the greater the anxiety, the greater the man.\u201d I don\u2019t know about that. But I do know that some of the things for which I am most thankful\u2014the opportunity to help lead a respected magazine; a place, however peripheral, in shaping public debate; a peripatetic and curious sensibility; and whatever quotients of emotional intelligence and good judgment I possess\u2014not only coexist with my condition but are in some meaningful way the product of it.\n\nIn his 1941 essay \u201cThe Wound and the Bow,\u201d the literary critic Edmund Wilson writes of the Sophoclean hero Philoctetes, whose suppurating, never-healing snakebite wound on his foot is linked to a gift for unerring accuracy with his bow and arrow\u2014his \u201cmalodorous disease\u201d is inseparable from his \u201csuperhuman art\u201d for marksmanship. I have always been drawn to this parable: in it lies, as the writer Jeanette Winterson has put it, \u201cthe nearness of the wound to the gift,\u201d the insight that in weakness and shamefulness is also the potential for transcendence, heroism, or redemption. My anxiety remains an unhealed wound that, at times, holds me back and fills me with shame\u2014but it may also be, at the same time, a source of strength and a bestower of certain blessings.", "description": "I've tried therapy, drugs, and booze.
