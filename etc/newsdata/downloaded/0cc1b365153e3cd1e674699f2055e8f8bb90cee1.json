People think that, when you\u2019re a model, everything looks good on you \u2013 but they forget that it depends on how you feel. Growing up, I wished I had boobs, I wished I had hips, I wished my body was like most other girls\u2019. But the reason I was so drawn to this Julien Macdonald dress was because I felt really sexy and confident in it. I felt really secure in myself as a woman.\n\nJulien Macdonald: \u2018Who would play me in the film of my life? They\u2019d have to be gorgeous\u2019 Read more\n\nThis is one of my favourite looks because it was so unexpected; a lot of my outfits take so much planning and preparation. I flew back from New York and landed on the morning of the GQ Men of the Year awards. I wasn\u2019t supposed to wear this dress, it was just a backup option. I didn\u2019t even have a fitting, but I tried it on and it fit perfectly, and everything just fell into place.\n\nI\u2019m someone who never usually goes out, but I loved this dress so much that I even went to the afterparty. I didn\u2019t get home until 7am, which is unheard of for me, but this outfit just put me in a good mood.\n\nOn an everyday basis, my style is very laid back and tomboyish. I don\u2019t really wear makeup when I\u2019m not working; I try to not even do my hair. Most days, I show one bit of my body \u2013 so if I\u2019m in joggers, I\u2019ll wear a bodysuit with it, or a crop top.\n\nI like people who are daring with their style, such as Rihanna. I feel like she can wear anything and she\u2019s not afraid to try new things. I also really love Tupac, he\u2019s my idol. I look at pictures of him and what he\u2019s wearing \u2013 double denim, for example, or camo \u2013 and it just looks so cool and relevant to this day. I also love Bollywood actresses, such as Sonam Kapoor. I love looking at their traditional outfits and their western outfits and seeing how they mix cultures together.", "description": "The model on partying until 7am in her favourite Julien Macdonald dress \u2013 and how she takes inspiration from the style of Bollywood actresses", "authors": ["Leah Harper", "As Told To"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb2752b2eeade9c9b692404939a0e028bdbec61d/0_134_3333_2000/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b52c4c65e140b6805bce7b28625788b3", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
