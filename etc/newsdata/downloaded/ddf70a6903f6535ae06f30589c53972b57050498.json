The internet is still unavailable both on cellphone and fixed line networks.\n\nLandlines were restored previously, although residents say connections are erratic.\n\nThe stripping of Kashmir\u2019s special status on August 5 also saw New Delhi send in tens of thousands of extra troops to what even before was one of the world\u2019s most heavily militarised zones.\n\nSeveral hundred Kashmiri politicians, activists, lawyers and others remain in custody, mostly without charge.\n\nSeveral thousand ordinary Kashmiris were also detained, including children as young as nine, with protesters and security forces clashing at regular rallies. Most have since been released.\n\n\u2013 Harsh words for Modi \u2013\n\nUN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said last month she was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d while Washington called for the \u201crapid\u201d lifting of restrictions.\n\nMohammad Akbar, a businessman, told AFP in the main city Srinagar that he was pleased that mobile phones were working again, but had harsh words for the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\u201cMobile phones are a commercial service that we pay for, not a favour,\u201d he said. \u201cThey slash our basic rights and then ease things as favours and call it normalcy.\u201d\n\nHaving mobile phones \u201cis something completely normal in most countries. But here in Kashmir it is a big deal\u201d, said law student Mashouq.\n\n\u201cAnd it can be taken away at any time.\u201d\n\nKashmir has been split between India and Pakistan since 1947 and has been the spark of two wars and numerous skirmishes \u2014 most recently in February when they conducted tit-for-tat air strikes.\n\nTens of thousands of people, most of them civilians, have died since 1989 in an uprising against Indian rule that New Delhi blames on Islamabad.", "description": "Srinagar (India) (AFP) \u2013 Mobile phone networks were restored in Indian Kashmir on Monday after a 72-day blackout, authorities said, but the internet", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/f7ca8d_mobiles-phone-services-resumed-in-indian-kashmir-72-day-blackout-but-internet-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
