There appears to be some interesting complexities surrounding air rights and aviation that may impact Amazon, Google, UPS and Fedex as they roll out drone delivery.\n\nhttps://getoffofmycloudblog.wordpress.com\n\nIt got me thinking about potential investment opportunities:\n\n1) Acquire air rights, which are deeded with title along with surface and mineral rights, in locations where drone traffic will be heavy. Speculate that air rights will increase in value as drone delivery expands.\n\n2) Securitize air rights and make a market for buying a selling that is backed by the underlying property\n\n3) Air rights markets already exist for commercial real estate in urban areas (i.e. Transferrable Development Rights in NYC). Could these markets be joined with air rights for drone delivery \"corridors\" that integrate urban and suburban flight paths ?\n\nI'd be interested to hear from others as to the viability of investing and speculating in air rights.\n\nDavid C.", "description": "Greetings all: I read an interesting article recently about air rights and drones.
