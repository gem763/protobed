According to ESPN, St. Thomas spends $1.1 million on its football program, but the other schools in the divisions it is considering \u2014 the Pioneer League and the Missouri Valley Conference \u2014 spend substantially more.\n\nSouth Dakota State and North Dakota State, for instance, spend $4.1 million and $5.6 million, respectively, on their football programs.\n\nIf the NCAA approves the move, St. Thomas would become only the second Div. I team in the state, joining the University of Minnesota\u2019s Golden Gophers.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "The Minnesota university that was booted out of Division III play for winning too many games has now been offered a spot in Division I.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/ap-jim-gehrz-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
