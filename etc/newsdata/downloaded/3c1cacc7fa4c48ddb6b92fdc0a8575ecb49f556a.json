It\u2019s been the spectacle of broadcast television nervously, and a little desperately, dancing on its own grave.\n\nThat was true again Sunday night, when Fox gamely played host to a telecast in which all but two awards (both for NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d) went to cable networks or streaming services. (Just for good measure, Disney announced during the broadcast that pre-orders could be made for its Disney Plus streaming service.)\n\nLike a three-hour magnifying glass, the Emmys show focuses the changes that are scorching the television business. What\u2019s revealed is that no one\u2019s sure what works at the moment. There\u2019s more good TV (broadly defined) than ever, but it\u2019s too multifarious, too out of control, for the old awards-show format, and no one\u2019s found the answer yet.", "description": "During an unfocused and mostly unremarkable show, the Emmy voters showed they were ahead of the Television Academy and Fox when it came to understanding the new world of TV.", "authors": ["Mike Hale"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/arts/22emmy-review2/22emmy-review2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
