What does a white Jewish guy who grew up on Long Island have to teach us about the cuisine of a notoriously complex, intimidatingly insular culture halfway around the world? Plenty, it turns out, when that gaijin is also an otaku\u2014the Japanese term for a relentless, irredeemable nerd in pursuit of knowledge.\n\nMr. Orkin is no dabbling dilettante. He lived in Tokyo for the better part of three decades, opened two successful ramen shops (an unprecedented achievement for a foreigner there), speaks Japanese fluently and is raising three kids with his Okinawa-born wife, Mari. The otaku approach doesn\u2019t just give him intel on Japanese cooking\u2014it gives him an end run around accusations of cultural appropriation. He doesn\u2019t position himself as an expert on a cuisine that isn\u2019t his own but, rather, as a devoted student.\n\nBut Mr. Orkin isn\u2019t interested in teaching readers how to craft the perfect scallop nigiri or a seasonal kaiseki feast\u2014or even in sharing the ramen recipes that made him famous. (He already covered that in his first cookbook.) \u201cJapanese food often gets treated with over-the-top reverence in English-language books,\u201d he writes.\n\nInstead, \u201cThe Gaijin Cookbook\u201d focuses on a branch of Japanese cuisine that doesn\u2019t often get the otaku treatment: home cooking. \u201cA Japanese life encompasses the same range of situations as an American one,\u201d Mr. Orkin notes. \u201cThere are busy weeknights and weekends when you feel ambitious, picky kids, special occasions, dreary winters, sweltering summers... parties and hangovers.\u201d These meals have as much to offer a student of Japanese cuisine as anything the documentary \u201cJiro Dreams of Sushi\u201d depicts with slo-mo, hi-def piety.\n\n\u201c \u2018He shares recipes honed over decades, until awkward edges have worn away like those of a river stone.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Orkin shares recipes honed over decades, until awkward edges\u2014the unnecessary ingredients, the extraneous steps\u2014have worn away like the crags of a river stone. His five-ingredient teriyaki sauce is \u201cversion 12.0,\u201d after a dozen iterations he and his wife cooked in the parade of weeknights we call life. Made from nothing but sake, mirin, soy sauce, sugar and a wild-card ingredient, oyster sauce, this teriyaki simmers for just 3 to 4 minutes but has an impressive syrupy richness. Recipes for other homestyle classics in the aptly named \u201cEmpathy/Comfort\u201d chapter, like Pork and Miso-Ginger Stew and Chicken-and-Egg Rice Bowl, reveal the Japanese knack for getting maximum impact from a few ingredients.\n\nEver the observant student, Mr. Orkin also shares shortcuts many Japanese eaters deploy in the real world\u2014a category of cultural knowledge just as valuable as from-scratch recipes and far rarer. Instead of serving platters of perfect tuna maki at a sushi party, Japanese home cooks will throw a temaki (hand roll) party, offering simply sliced fish, a big bowl of rice, an array of toppings and squares of nori for guests to assemble. Japanese curry is built on a foundation of store-bought \u201ccurry roux\u201d (though Mr. Orkin does offer a DIY version as well). He even shares the blueprint for a ramen feast that relies on a dozen packages of instant ramen.\n\nMr. Orkin doesn\u2019t shy away from time-consuming recipes, though. He devotes an entire chapter to \u201cOtaku\u201d cooking, a term he applies to recipes that are all-day affairs\u2014like making dozens of gyoza\u2014or to those that require a special level of commitment, like his beloved deep-fried katsu, croquettes and fried shrimp.\n\nPerhaps the most refreshing chapter is the one that pays homage to yoshoku, the Japanese term for \u201cWestern Cooking\u201c\u2014an entirely legitimate branch of Japanese cuisine devoted to so-called Western dishes such as Spaghetti Napolitan, centered on ketchup rather than tomatoes. Indeed, the Japanese have a long tradition of mixing foreign influences into their cuisine to create entirely new and wonderful dishes. It\u2019s what gave a Jewish guy from Long Island the confidence to apply what he knew about chicken soup to ramen. In his own words, \u201cIronically, my readiness to meld ideas from different worlds was the most Japanese thing I could do.\u201d\n\nTeriyaki 12.0\n\nMAKES: 1 cup\n\nTeriyaki is the embodiment of the sweet-soy flavor so many people associate with Japanese food. It\u2019s a lifesaver for weekday dinners, and you can also employ it for more elaborate projects like slow-cooked ribs. This one requires just five ingredients, and then you\u2019re in teriyaki town.\n\n\u00bc cup sake\n\n\u00bc cup mirin\n\n\u00bc cup soy sauce\n\n\u00bc cup oyster sauce\n\n1 tablespoon sugar\n\nIn a bowl, whisk together all ingredients until sugar dissolves. You\u2019re good to go. Store in the fridge up to a couple weeks.\n\nFOR BEEF OR PORK\n\nPan-fry or grill a piece of meat to medium-rare or your desired doneness. (Hanger, bavette, skirt or boneless rib-eye steaks all work well, as do boneless pork chops and pork tenderloin). Let rest a few minutes. Meanwhile, bring teriyaki sauce to a simmer in a skillet over medium heat and cook until reduced to a syrupy consistency, 3-4 minutes. Cut meat against the grain into \u00bd -inch-thick slices and arrange on a platter. Pour sauce over sliced meat and serve with warm rice.\n\nFOR CHICKEN\n\nDust 4 or 5 boneless, skinless chicken thighs with all-purpose flour. In a well-oiled nonstick pan over medium heat, brown chicken on both sides. Add teriyaki sauce, bring to a simmer and cook, flipping chicken to coat, until sauce reduces to a syrupy consistency, 3-4 minutes. Serve over warm rice.\n\nFOR FISH\n\nPlace a nonstick or well-seasoned carbon-steel skillet over medium heat and coat with oil. Carefully lay a large fillet of firm fish (salmon, halibut, yellowtail or black cod) into pan. Brown fish on both sides, then add teriyaki sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook, flipping fish to coat, until sauce reduces to a syrupy consistency, 3-4 minutes. Serve over warm rice.\n\n\u2014Adapted from \u201cThe Gaijin Cookbook\u201d by Ivan Orkin (Sep. 24, Rux Martin/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt)", "description": "\u2018The Gaijin Cookbook\u2019 brings the passion of an obsessive to Japanese home cooking.", "authors": ["Adina Steiman"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105612/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
