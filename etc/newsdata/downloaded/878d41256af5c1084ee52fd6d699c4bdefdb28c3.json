The deaths of a further six journalists have gone unconfirmed in Mexico this year.\n\nIn total, 81 journalists and one media worker have been assassinated in Mexico dating back to 2009.\n\nNevith Condes Jaramillo, who ran local news website El Observador del Sur, was stabbed dead August 24 in Tejupilco, a city in the State of Mexico.\n\nJorge Celestino Ru\u00edz V\u00e1zquez, a reporter for the newspaper El Gr\u00e1fico, was shot dead August 2 at a store he owned in the eastern state of Veracruz.\n\nMexican authorities have yet to solve either murder.\n\nThe country with the largest number of unsolved killings was the Philippines with 41, followed by Mexico, the group said.\n\nNevith Condes Jaramillo, who ran local news website El Observador del Sur, was stabbed dead August 24 in Tejupilco, a city in the State of Mexico.

At least 81 journalists and one media worker have been assassinated in Mexico since 2009\n\nOverall, more than 200 killings of journalists have gone unsolved in 13 countries cited by the media watchdog group.\n\nThe 13 countries accounted for 222 of the 318 deaths in the last 10 years, CPJ said, with many of the cases linked to war and civil unrest.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists said the countries on its list were home to the majority of journalist killings over the past 10 years.\n\nSomalia was the worst country for the fifth year in a row in a ranking based on deaths as a percentage of each country's population -- 25 unsolved killings in a country of 15 million people.\n\nSyria was second and Iraq third on the list.\n\nThe countries 'represent a mix of conflict-ridden regions and more stable countries where criminal groups, politicians, government officials, and other powerful actors resort to violence to silence critical and investigative reporting.'\n\nOther countries making up the 13 worst were South Sudan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Brazil, Bangladesh, Russia, Nigeria and India.\n\n'In the past decade, armed militant groups such as Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram and the Islamic State group have most often targeted journalists with complete impunity,' the CPJ report said.\n\n'However, criminal groups have become a major threat, killing large numbers of journalists and routinely escaping justice. Mexico, to date this year's deadliest country for journalists, has seen its impunity rating worsen nearly every year since 2008, as criminal cartels waged a campaign of terror against the media.'\n\n", "description": "The murders of at least 30 journalists have gone unsolved in the last 10 years, making Mexico the second most dangerous country for the working media in the last decade.", "authors": ["Adry Torres For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/17/20339632-0-image-a-5_1572370846933.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
