Remember George McGovern?\n\nRegulatory reform and regenerative agriculture generally involve giving power back to the individual, and makes the responsibility for the environment personal. The necessary actions are different for different locations and local economies, but generally involve changes that are low-cost, and the results can be measured over short periods of time. Sequestering carbon can be easily measured and monitored, and the impact quantified. Predicting atmospheric average temperatures 100 years from now based on small changes in carbon dioxide is a fool\u2019s errand, and that is where the Democratic Party stands.\n\nSo far, whether President Trump is just following his instincts and basic common sense or he has some kind of special climate/environmental expertise, his actions make him the real protector of the environment.\n\nSAMUEL BURKEEN\n\nReston, Va.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
