Something similar was happening, if rather more quietly and confidentially, in and around the coroner\u2019s court.\n\nMore than two years after the bombing at the Manchester Arena, which killed 23 people and injured more than 100, a controversy has erupted about the form that the inquests \u2013 which are required by law \u2013 should take, what evidence should be heard, and how.\n\nIt is a controversy that is all too predictable. It centres yet again on the balance that has to be drawn in any democratic, law-governed, country between accountability and transparency, on the one hand, and the requirements of national security, on the other.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnd yet again, the UK public in general and the survivors of a terrorist atrocity and their families and friends, in particular, look set to be scandalously shortchanged, with the security and intelligence services likely to be given a free pass. The line, in other words, is being drawn in the wrong place.\n\nThe background to the Manchester bombing is complicated \u2013 with gaps in the timeline suggesting that the authorities know more than they are prepared to say. A year afterwards, it emerged that the suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, had not only been on the radar of UK intelligence services but was among 100 or so UK citizens who had been evacuated from Tripoli by the Royal Navy three years earlier, as the civil war in Libya raged.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The authorities, though, have other ideas. Last month, Sir John Saunders, the coroner of the Manchester Arena inquest, ruled that there was some intelligence that would cause a risk to national security if it became public.\n\nHe upheld what is called a \u201cpublic interest immunity\u201d application, underwritten by the Home Secretary, which claim that some of the testimony that security and other officers would give is so sensitive that it should not be heard in open court.\n\nMaking this testimony public, Sir John said in his ruling, would \u201cassist terrorists in carrying out the sort of atrocities committed in Manchester\u201d and make it less likely that the security service and counter-terrorism police would be able to prevent them. He said that a balancing exercise was required, and \u201cthe balancing exercise strongly favours the material in question not being disclosed\u201d.\n\nHe now faces a choice. Either the inquests proceed with no evidence from the security services or anti-terrorism police (as all evidence at an inquest must be public), or the inquests are ditched and reconvened as a public inquiry, where \u2013 perversely \u2013 evidence can be heard in closed session, or by the presiding judge alone. It would appear that Sir John favours a public inquiry, as he noted that \u201can adequate investigation ... could not be conducted within the framework of the inquests\u201d.\n\nThe result will inevitably mean less transparency than the survivors and families want and deserve \u2013 they (and the media) are likely to be excluded from the court if and when the supposedly sensitive intelligence and counter-terrorism evidence is given \u2013 and still more delay.\n\nThe latest planned date for the inquests was next April \u2013 practically three years after the bombing. But the re-casting of the inquests as a public inquiry will take more planning, and there is now another consideration. Last month, the UK secured the extradition from Libya of Hashem Abedi, Salman\u2019s younger brother, who is to be tried in connection with the bombing. Convention has it that any trial precedes an inquest/inquiry. Everyone concerned is in for a long wait.\n\nForgive me if I sound a little jaded, but we have been around these tracks many times before. Lady Justice Hallett, who presided at the inquests after the 7/7 London bombings, fought a doughty battle to have the security services and counter-terrorism police testify. And she partially won. A witness described as a \u201cvery senior MI5 officer\u201d testified from behind a green curtain. That was back in 2011. We are no further forward now.\n\nTime and again, MI5, MI6 and the counter-terrorism police have refused to allow their officers to testify in open court, even anonymously from behind a curtain, as at the 7/7 inquest, or in-camera. There have been times \u2013 with former British citizens or British residents, in particular, who were imprisoned at Guantanamo or subject to \u201crendition\u201d to third countries where they were tortured \u2013 when the government has preferred to pay large sums in compensation, rather than have testimony from or about the security services aired in court. The result is a thick veil of secrecy.\n\nMarina Litvinenko had to wait nine years for the inquiry into her husband\u2019s radiation poisoning and when the inquiry eventually took place, a substantial amount of the evidence \u2013 protected by those very same \u201cpublic interest immunity\u201d certificates that now protect the security services in relation to the Manchester bombing \u2013 came from the security services and was heard not even in closed court, but by the judge alone. All reference to that evidence was excluded from the eventual judgment. What sort of judicial process is that?\n\nJohn Cooper QC, the barrister representing the families of the Manchester victims, has said he is aware of \u201cembarrassing\u201d evidence which highlighted the \u201cshortcomings\u201d of the security services.\n\nHow does anyone know that failings and embarrassment are not as much \u2013 or indeed more \u2013 the reason for secrecy than any genuine risk to national security? The days of \u201ctrust us, we\u2019re the government\u201d are over; they have been over at least since the UK went to war in Iraq on the basis of erroneous intelligence. It is time for a whole new appraisal of the secrecy that shrouds MI5 and MI6 and the rest.\n\nOf course, there are still secrets that must be kept; secrets that would pose a real threat to national security were they divulged. Not everything can be out in the open. But in a modern democracy, there is also a need for accountability and I would venture that the United States has it at least a fraction more right here than we do.\n\nAnyone who wants proof of how ossified our structures are needs look no further than the admirable BBC4 documentary series The Troubles. A secret history. The latest instalment dealt specifically with the activities of the UK intelligence services in Northern Ireland.\n\nAlong with the real heroism and the operations justifiably conducted in the shadows were accounts of excesses and illegality that not only ended and blighted lives but remain under wraps \u2013 and excused \u2013 to this day. What is more, the defence for secrecy, right or wrong, seems every bit as pervasive now as it was then.\n\nIf trust in government has any chance of being restored, reforms that would allow more light to be cast on the activities and competence of the security services could be a good place to start.", "description": "The Conservative Party conference was not the only place in Manchester where urgent behind-the-scenes discussions were going on this week.
