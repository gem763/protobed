As official interest rates fall closer to zero, the banks say they cannot recoup lower lending rates from depositors who are already accepting interest rates at or near zero.\n\nBut the banks have come under fire because, as they compete aggressively for new loans, a gap has opened up between the rate they offer to lure new customers relative to the rates paid by longer standing loyal customers.\n\nRock and a hard place\n\n\"It feels as if we are going over ground that was covered in the Royal Commission last year. Twelve months ago, everyone was talking about front book versus back book,\" said Jason Kururangi, investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think that it's very hard for someone to legislate how banks price,\" he said. \"That brings more challenges.\"\n\n\"I feel like the banks are caught between a rock and a hard place,\" the fund manager added. \"The lower interest rates go, the harder it gets to maintain profit levels.\"\n\n\"I'm cautious about their margins and that leads me to be cautious about the sector.\"\n\nThe outlook for the banks likely depends on the monetary policy and what the Reserve Bank intends to do going forward, Mr Kururangi said.\n\n\"If they went down the quantitative easing path, it would depend on how that would be structured. I would say, however, that it would be more positive if we saw some more fiscal spending from the government.\n\n\"It's potentially why the Treasurer is having a crack at the banks. If more of the interest rate cut was passed through, it would free up a lot of cash for the consumer to potentially put some money back into the economy.\"\n\nIn such a scenario, the need for fiscal spending may not be so pressing, Mr Kururangi said.\n\nOne form of stimulus is not on the fund manager's policy preference list, however, and that's negative interest rates.\n\n\"I would prefer not to enter a world of negative interest rates. European banks have underperformed. Some of that is self-inflicted but at the same time it's hard to generate returns in an environment of low interest rates.\"\n\nMr Patkar added: \"Zero bound in where people fear what happens next.\"", "description": "Investors remain cautious about the banks, which are under pressure from lower interest rates and near-permanent political scrutiny.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3027%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fb1a1f08b925e6a9c3b87ff3e6a51bfeb0b3e600", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
