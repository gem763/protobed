The announcement sent the US West Texas Intermediate crude futures surging to $52.88 per barrel, or up 3.4% from the day's start.\n\nVisit Business Insider South Africa's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe US is accusing Iran of carrying out attacks on two tankers just outside the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway through which more than 30% of the world's seaborne crude oil passes, and the US Navy has reportedly discovered an unexploded mine that may very well be evidence of Iran's culpability in Thursday's attacks.\n\nThe USS Bainbridge, a US warship deployed to the Middle East, spotted a limpet mine on the side of one of the two tankers hit on Thursday, CNN reported, citing a US defence official. Another defence official confirmed the discovery to Fox News, telling reporters that \"it's highly likely Iran is responsible.\"\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday afternoon that Iran was responsible for the attacks, an announcement that briefly spiked US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures up to $52.88 per barrel, or 3.4% from the day's start.\n\nIt is the assessment of the U.S. government that Iran is responsible for today's attacks in the Gulf of Oman. These attacks are a threat to international peace and security, a blatant assault on the freedom of navigation, and an unacceptable escalation of tension by Iran. pic.twitter.com/cbLrWNU5S0 \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) June 13, 2019\n\nHe did not provide specific evidence for the accusations but said US conclusions were \"based on the level of expertise for the execution, and recent attacks on shipping, and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.\"\n\nThe limpet mine spotted by the US Navy was reportedly discovered on the Kokuka Courageous, one of two tankers targeted. Twenty-one sailors rescued from the damaged ship are aboard the USS Bainbridge, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer that was operating nearby and called in to assist.\n\nA limpet mine is an explosive with a detonator that can be attached to the hull of a ship using magnets, and Iranian forces are believed to have used these weapons in an attack on four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates in May. While the US has blamed Iran for the attacks, Tehran, Iran's capital, has repeatedly denied any involvement.\n\nThe UAE determined an unnamed \"state actor\" was behind the tanker attacks and concluded \"it was highly likely that limpet mines were deployed.\"\n\nThere has been some debate about who was behind the latest attacks, with one official telling ABC News that \"we're not pointing to Iran, but we're not ruling anything out at this time.\" Another official asked the media outlet, \"Who else could it be?\"\n\nIran used mines heavily during the Tanker Wars in the late 1980s.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, who may have been briefed on the situation, was quick to pin the blame on Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, telling reporters: \"I saw some press accounts today sort of saying it's not clear who did it. Well, it wasn't the Belgians. It wasn't the Swiss. I mean, it was them. They're the ones that did it. We've been warning about it.\"\n\nIn early May, the US began deploying military assets to the Middle East as a deterrence force in response to intelligence indicating that Iran was planning attacks on US interests. The US has so far sent a carrier strike group, a bomber task force, a missile-defence battery, and a number of other capabilities into the US Central Command area of responsibility.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The US accused Iran of attacks on two tankers outside the Strait of Hormuz, through which more than 30% of the world's seaborne crude oil passes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9000/2b6b1c801afc4602a92f6831876ff54e.png", "published_at": "2019-06-13"}
