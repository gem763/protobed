The goal is to eventually begin implanting devices in paralyzed humans, allowing them to control phones or computers.\n\nThe first big advance is flexible \u201cthreads,\u201d which are less likely to damage the brain than the materials currently used in brain-machine interfaces. These threads also create the possibility of transferring a higher volume of data, according to a white paper credited to \u201cElon Musk & Neuralink.\u201d The abstract notes that the system could include \u201cas many as 3,072 electrodes per array distributed across 96 threads.\u201d\n\nThinner than a human hair\n\nThe threads are 4 to 6 \u03bcm in width, which makes them considerably thinner than a human hair. In addition to developing the threads, Neuralink\u2019s other big advance is a machine that automatically embeds them.\n\nMusk gave a big presentation of Neuralink\u2019s research Tuesday night, though he said that it wasn\u2019t simply for hype. \u201cThe main reason for doing this presentation is recruiting,\u201d Musk said, asking people to go apply to work there. Max Hodak, president of Neuralink, also came on stage and admitted that he wasn\u2019t originally sure \u201cthis technology was a good idea,\u201d but that Musk convinced him it would be possible.\n\nIn the future, scientists from Neuralink hope to use a laser beam to get through the skull, rather than drilling holes, they said in interviews with The New York Times. Early experiments will be done with neuroscientists at Stanford University, according to that report. \u201cWe hope to have this in a human patient by the end of next year,\u201d Musk said.\n\nDuring a Q&A at the end of the presentation, Musk revealed results that the rest of the team hadn\u2019t realized he would: \u201cA monkey has been able to control a computer with its brain.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be suddenly Neuralink will have this neural lace and start taking over people\u2019s brains,\u201d Musk said. \u201cUltimately\u201d he wants \u201cto achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence.\u201d And that even in a \u201cbenign scenario,\u201d humans would be \u201cleft behind.\u201d Hence, he wants to create technology that allows a \u201cmerging with AI.\u201d He later added \u201cwe are a brain in a vat, and that vat is our skull,\u201d and so the goal is to read neural spikes from that brain.\n\nThe first person with spinal cord paralysis to receive a brain implant that allowed him to control a computer cursor was Matthew Nagle. In 2006, Nagle played Pong using only his mind; the basic movement required took him only four days to master, he told The New York Times. Since then, paralyzed people with brain implants have also brought objects into focus and moved robotic arms in labs, as part of scientific research. The system Nagle and others have used is called BrainGate and was developed initially at Brown University.\n\n\u201cNeuralink didn\u2019t come out of nowhere, there\u2019s a long history of academic research here,\u201d Hodak said at the presentation on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re, in the greatest sense, building on the shoulders of giants.\u201d However, none of the existing technologies fit Neuralink\u2019s goal of directly reading neural spikes in a minimally invasive way.\n\nThe system presented today, if it\u2019s functional, may be a substantial advance over older technology. BrainGate relied on the Utah Array, a series of stiff needles that allows for up to 128 electrode channels. Not only is that fewer channels than Neuralink is promising \u2014 meaning less data from the brain is being picked up \u2014 it\u2019s also stiffer than Neuralink\u2019s threads. That\u2019s a problem for long-term functionality: the brain shifts in the skull but the needles of the array don\u2019t, leading to damage. The thin polymers Neuralink is using may solve that problem.\n\nHowever, Neuralink\u2019s technology is more difficult to implant than the Utah Array, precisely because it\u2019s so flexible. To combat that problem, the company has developed \u201da neurosurgical robot capable of inserting six threads (192 electrodes) per minute [automatically],\u201d according to the white paper. In photos, it looks something like a cross between a microscope and a sewing machine. It also avoids blood vessels, which may lead to less of an inflammatory response in the brain, the paper says.\n\nFor Musk, the central problem of interacting with AI is actually \u201cbandwidth.\u201d You can take in information much more quickly than you push it out via your voice or your thumbs, but you\u2019re already connected to a machine \u2014 an idea most closely associated with philosopher Andy Clark. Hence, his goal is for this system to allow humans to more quickly communicate with machines directly from their brains.\n\nFinally, the paper says that Neuralink has developed a custom chip that is better able to read, clean up, and amplify signals from the brain. Right now, it can only transmit data via a wired connection (it uses USB-C), but ultimately the goal is to create a system than can work wirelessly.\n\nThat wireless goal will be embodied in a product that Neuralink calls the \u201cN1 sensor,\u201d designed to be embedded inside a human body and transmit its data wirelessly. It may read fewer neurons than the current USB-based prototype. Neuralink intends to implant four of these sensors, three in motor areas and one in a somatosensor area. It will connect wirelessly to an external device mounted behind the ear, which will contain the only battery. \u201cIt will be controlled through an iPhone app,\u201d Hodak said.\n\n\u201cThere is a whole FDA process we have to go though,\u201d he added, \u201cwe haven\u2019t done that yet.\u201d Matthew MacDougall, head surgeon at Neuralink who appeared dressed in scrubs, said on Tuesday that safety is a primary goal, and that ultimately they want it to be \u201csomething more like Lasik\u201d eye surgery \u2014 including eliminating the need for general anesthesia. The first patients wouldn\u2019t have that non-invasive experience, though.\n\nRight now, though, the company is still working in rats to make sure the platform is stable. But the technology, if it works, is promising: a \u201chigh bandwidth\u201d brain connection, implanted via robot surgery. The connection made using thin flexible \u201cthreads\u201d would allow many neurons\u2019 activity to be recorded. The hope is for better, more precise outcomes than previous attempts at brain-machine interfaces.", "description": "Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink, the secretive company developing brain-machine interfaces, showed off some of the technology it has been developing to the public for the first time.
