True \u201cJaneites\u201d tend to travel widely to celebrate their favourite author, most often to Bath for the Jane Austen festival. But on the other side of the world sits Governor\u2019s House, a picturesque, yellow Georgian-style mansion in Hyde Park, Vermont. The house, along with its owner Suzanne Boden, draws Janeites from all over the globe \u2013 who come not only to celebrate their favourite author, but to live as a character in her world.\n\nBoden had the idea to start hosting Austen weekends at her home 11 years ago. \u201cI was outside hanging tablecloths on the clothesline,\u201d she says, \u201cagainst the backdrop of Governor\u2019s House, and I was listening to some music through the window, which happened to be Mozart. From the back of the house, you can\u2019t see anything that\u2019s modern because of the trees. And I thought: \u2018I could be Jane Austen! And someone else might want to come and be Austen, too.\u2019\u201d\n\nOthers did. For more than a decade, Boden, who also offers the occasional Downton Abbey experience, has been hosting in-character weekends where attendees \u2013 who range in age from seven to 80 \u2013 get the pleasure of living life through the eyes and words of Austen.\n\nOne woman clearly thought it was going to be like the movie Austenland and she\u2019d meet her husband here\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an escape,\u201d says Boden, who encourages guests to eschew modern technology and leave their phones behind. \u201cIt\u2019s about going back in time. It\u2019s a chance to dress up. Most of all, it\u2019s a chance to be with, and interact with, other Austen fans, who always have a lot to say. It\u2019s unusual if someone goes home without a long list of book recommendations or film recommendations from new friends.\u201d People come for all sorts of reasons: \u201cOne woman clearly thought it was going to be like the movie Austenland and she\u2019d meet her husband here.\u201d\n\nAlthough guests don\u2019t typically find partners at the rate Austen\u2019s characters do, they do gain new skills: learning to write with a quill pen and fold paper the way the author did, before envelopes existed. They get English country dancing lessons and indulge in afternoon tea. No lunch is served, because, as Boden points out, lunch wasn\u2019t invented in Austen\u2019s time (neither was afternoon tea, but an exception is made). Other weekend activities include sewing reticules (a small purse-like bag used in Austen\u2019s time to carry gloves, a fan, and perhaps even love notes), horse-drawn carriage rides and archery.\n\nA recent weekend dedicated to Emma at Governor\u2019s House drew Janeites from as far away as Texas. On a Friday night, attendees nibbled lemon squares and sipped tea as they watched a short lecture titled \u201cBared Bosoms and Padded Calves\u201d (on the fashions of Regency England).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Two women in Regency costume walking dogs through Bath during the city\u2019s annual Jane Austen festival.

When asked why so many Americans love Austen, Boden is incredulous. \u201cEverybody loves Jane Austen! She gets right to the heart of things,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the surface, it looks like a little romance, but there are so many layers in her works, which have been translated into \u2013 well, how many languages are there in the world? Although it\u2019s very British, she doesn\u2019t mention anything going on politically \u2026 so it could be set anywhere.\u201d\n\nOver a breakfast of tea, blueberry muffins and baked eggs, guests discuss favourite books, adaptations, characters \u2013 and their shared love for spotting inaccuracies in period films (\u201cI heard there\u2019s a shocking lack of hairpins in the new Little Women!\u201d). Everyone agrees that Henry from Mansfield Park was one of her best male creations, for being sweet, competent and witty. \u201cBut he was never witty in a mean way, or at someone else\u2019s expense,\u201d says Lena Ruth Yasutake, a 36-year-old teacher from Connecticut. She runs a Regency clothing business called Cassandra\u2019s Closet (a subtle nod to Austen) with her sister-in-law Anna, who has also joined the party: she had her hair in rag curlers yesterday night and has an Austenesque hairstyle ready for breakfast. Lena\u2019s her devotion to Austen has been hard-won: \u201cI pushed through my dyslexia to finish Emma because I loved the story so much. It was my \u2018gateway drug\u2019 into Austen.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018 Everybody loves Jane Austen!\u2019 ... Women take a turn through the grounds of Governor\u2019s House\n\nThe women here tend to come in groups: Vermont bookstore owner Kim Crady-Smith has brought her sister, her niece and a friend, who sit alongside three childhood friends from Dallas, all in their 70s. Ann, who urged her friends Charlene and Mary to join her, has attended other Austen weekends before, and, as a result, ended up joining the Dallas chapter of JASNA. The Dallas meetings aren\u2019t as much fun as Boden\u2019s weekends, Ann says: \u201cAfter experiencing this, it\u2019s hard to settle for less!\u201d\n\nJaneites delight in Austen\u2019s words and stories, but what most bonds the Americans is a bit more complex. Anglophilia is strong throughout the US; its presence is reflected in Americans\u2019 appetite for British television and film, football, music and more. The enthusiasm for Austen reflects a wider desire to journey into a world that feels foreign and familiar all at once.\n\nRegency rendezvous: inside the world of Jane Austen fandom Read more\n\nAt the end of Boden\u2019s weekends, she gives guests a quiz over Sunday brunch. Throughout the weekend, she drops hints and breadcrumbs of information that are answers to Sunday\u2019s quiz. What happens if you fail the quiz? Boden doesn\u2019t miss a beat: \u201cIf you flunk, you get the greatest prize of all: you get to reread the novel.\u201d", "description": "Complete with quills, country dancing and rag curls, a country hotel is wooing dedicated Janeites to visit their favourite fictional world", "authors": ["Anne Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6230ecebccaaaa4aa3c70ff42c51d7356ed93e7/0_70_933_560/master/933.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7000947cd4a5d090577a60c4e36f7cff", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
