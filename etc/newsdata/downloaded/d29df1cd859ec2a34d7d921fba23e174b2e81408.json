Unai Emery\u2019s side are now without a win in their last four matches on the road.\n\nEvra famously called Arsenal players \u2018babies\u2019 after his United side beat Arsene Wenger\u2019s men to the Champions League final back in 2009 \u2013 and the Frenchman repeated the jibe once again on Monday evening.\n\nEvra admits Milner would endlessly \u2018frustrate\u2019 him during his playing days (Picture: Sky Sports)\n\n\u2018I used to call them \u201cmy babies\u201d ten years ago, and they are still when I look at them and think they are \u201cmy babies\u201d and that\u2019s the truth \u2013 I\u2019m not being disrespectful when I say that,\u2019 Evra said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They look pretty, but they don\u2019t look like a winning team.\n\n\u2018They like playing good football, but I was so happy to play against them, because I knew I was going to win.\u2019\n\nEvra\u2019s explosive words unsurprisingly drew a strong reaction, with Granit Xhaka branding his comments \u2018bulls***\u2019 in the wake of the Gunners\u2019 1-0 defeat at Bramall Lane.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nAfter his brutal attack on Arsenal, Evra surprised viewers with an usual shout for the toughest player he faced throughout his career.\n\n\u2018James Milner. I played against Messi many times in the wide position, and I won\u2019t say he\u2019s easy to mark, but I could deal with it,\u2019 the ex-France international said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s when he goes central, that\u2019s when he\u2019s dangerous because he can turn on the right or left.\n\n\u2018James Milner, only because he could frustrate me because I\u2019m an attacking defender and he\u2019s following me everywhere and challenging me in the air and I would just get frustrated sometimes: \u201cJust go and attack and leave me alone!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When I was playing the derby against Manchester City, I had him and then he went to Liverpool and I had him again.\n\n\u2018So yeah, the one who frustrated me the most was James Milner.\n\n\u2018Of course, [Aaron] Lennon was the type of player that, if I wasn\u2019t 100 per cent fit, would run behind me, and defender\u2019s hate when a player runs behind.\n\n\u2018Lennon\u2019s quick movement was difficult to play against, but yeah, it\u2019s James Milner.\u2019\n\nEvra has spoken with United over a possible return (Picture: Getty)\n\nEvra also confirmed that he\u2019s held talks with United over a potential role at Old Trafford.\n\n\u2018I retired five months ago and I thought maybe I will now enjoy my life but no, I\u2019m doing my coaching badges with Manchester United,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018But I want to make it clear because some people think i\u2019m already working for United but no, there\u2019s been some talks.\n\n\u2018But at the moment I\u2019m only doing my badges. I know everyone is excited to see me back at the club.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvra insisted discussions with United were still only at a preliminary stage after Jamie Carragher raised a recent Instagram post which suggested otherwise.\n\nHe said: \u2018I\u2019m having some important talks behind the scenes and we\u2019ll decide whether I will work for the club in a certain role or not we\u2019ll see.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t know yet I want to do erverything but in life you can\u2019t do everything but a role where I can get my hands dirty.\n\n\u2018If i come back to the club it\u2019s not just to put my face on it it\u2019s to make sure that the club is going back to being the best club in the world. As a player I sacrificed my life to succeed at this club. I don\u2019t know which role I have but I will do the same.\u2019\n\nMORE: Dive?
