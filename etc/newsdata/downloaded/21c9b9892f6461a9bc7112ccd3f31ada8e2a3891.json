She heard about the meat-only diet and decided to try it back in October 2018, sticking to eating only meat, including organ meats such as liver, along with some eggs and dairy. Zielke says that, before becoming pregnant with her third child (she is 17 weeks along), she had lost 30 pounds and her complexion cleared up.\n\n\u201cThe benefits that I personally have experienced is a satiated appetite, amazing body composition, cleared up and brighter skin, calmer mood, greatly improved energy levels and absolutely no pain in my body,\u201d the Wisconsin native told the publication.\n\nBut is it healthy?\n\nNot really. Stacey Pence, registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that restrictive diets like these are not healthy. \u201cFood elimination diets or very restrictive diets generally are not recommended for overall health unless you have food allergies, intolerances or a specific medical condition where it might be recommended to avoid or eliminate certain foods,\u201d Pence says.\n\nShe continues: \u201cIf limiting your diet to only meat, you will be missing out on a variety of other nutrients, including phytochemicals from our plant-based food sources that may improve immune system and reduce inflammation, to name a few benefits. There are many other individual nutrients that an all-meat diet would be lacking.\u201d\n\nAccording to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, research shows that a diet rich in plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, beans, legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains) can reduce your risk of developing chronic disease. For a cancer-protective diet, the American Institute for Cancer Research recommends limiting your animal proteins to one-third or less of your plate and filling two-thirds or more of your plate with fruits, vegetables, beans and/or whole grains.\n\nPence also points out that pregnancy is not the time to be so restrictive with your diet. \u201cNutrients are our babies\u2019 building blocks, and this is not a time I would recommend following an elimination diet or very restrictive diet,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is an even more critical time to get the nutrients in from a variety of sources for fetal development.\u200b\u201d\n\nThe weight loss explained\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not exactly surprising that, before becoming pregnant, Zielke would lose weight on a mostly meat diet. Even if one\u2019s eating style isn\u2019t considered balanced and healthy, it\u2019s still possible to lose weight. \u201cWeight loss is just a matter of energy \u2014 a.k.a. calorie \u2014 deficit,\u201d explains Pence. \u201cIf you do any food group elimination or portion reduction, you will be reducing calories, which leads to weight loss. A reduction of any macronutrient \u2014 carbs, protein, fat \u2014 can lead to calorie deficits, causing weight loss.\u201d\n\nAnd on restrictive diets, carbohydrates are usually the first ones to go. \u201cUnfortunately, carbohydrates are often given a bad rap,\u201d says Pence, who explains that it\u2019s preferable to get carbs from low-fat dairy, fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans. \u201cCarbohydrates are just one of the three macronutrients that provide calories in our diet. If you consume a carbohydrate-heavy diet, which leaves you feeling less satiated, it can cause weight gain, but any macronutrient (carbs, protein, fat) in excess can cause weight gain.\u201d\n\nPence notes that while \u201cmany people often exceed the recommended portion of carbohydrates, which can lead to weight gain,\u201d she adds that \u201ccarbs are not the enemy \u2014 often our portion sizes are!\u201d\n\nCan an all-meat diet clear up acne?\n\nThe mom also claims that the all-meat diet cleared up her acne. But dermatologist Nava Greenfield of Schweiger Dermatology Group in Brooklyn, N.Y., tells Yahoo Lifestyle that\u2019s unlikely. \u201cAn all-meat diet is very difficult,\u201d she says, \u201cand there is little to no evidence that it will clear up acne.\u201d\n\nHowever, Pence notes that there are animal sources high in vitamin A, such as beef liver and cod liver oil, which may help improve skin. \u201cThe vitamin A in these food sources are a pre-formed vitamin A known as retinol, which may improve skin health,\u201d she says. \u201cRetinol is often found in skin care products.\u201d", "description": "A mom of two says the all-meat Carnivore Diet helped her lose weight post-pregnancy and cleared up her acne.
