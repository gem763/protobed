LOUIS \u2013 In this era of hyper-efficiency and cost certainty, it\u2019s a popular sentiment to suggest you can\u2019t buy a World Series.\n\nThe Washington Nationals\u2019 more than half-billion dollar investment in starting pitching is coming awfully close to rebuking that theory.\n\nThey will return home to D.C. in firm control of their first National League Championship Series, registering as many wins at Busch Stadium as the Cardinals produced hits.\n\nIf that seems like a typo, well, you probably didn\u2019t see Anibal Sanchez and Max Scherzer carve up the Cardinals in consecutive games.\n\nSaturday, it was Scherzer\u2019s turn, befuddling the Cardinals as afternoon shadows danced around Busch Stadium, then ramping up his dominance as they faded. Like Sanchez, he took a no-hitter into the late innings before settling for one lousy hit allowed, and the Nationals eased away for a 3-1 Game 2 victory.\n\nMonday at Nationals Park, they will send out their best pitcher this season, Stephen Strasburg, to go for the kill in Game 3. He\u2019ll be opposed by Jack Flaherty, the Cardinals\u2019 ace, but what good will that do if his boys can\u2019t get any hits for him?\n\nThe ugly numbers for St. Louis\u2019 starting eight after two games: 2 hits in 54 at-bats, as excellent starts from Adam Wainwright and Miles Mikolas were wasted.\n\nIf they do the same for Flaherty, winter will come quickly to St. Louis \u2013 and Washington will capture its first pennant since 1933.\n\nMax Scherzer struck out 11 and allowed just one hot over seven innings. (Photo: Jeff Curry,USA TODAY Sports)\n\nTurning point\n\nMichael A. Taylor spent much of this season in Class AA but worked his way onto the playoff roster with a nice September. After Victor Robles\u2019 hamstring injury in the NLDS, he\u2019s now the Nationals\u2019 center fielder.\n\nSaturday, he was their saving grace, too.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 No. 8 hitter popped a third-inning home run to give Scherzer the breathing room he needed, and he singled off Wainwright in the fifth to turn the lineup over. That added up later when the Nationals cobbled together a pair of insurance runs in the eighth.\n\nWELCOME BACK: Closer returns to Nats: 'Life comes at you fast'\n\nGAME 1: Unheralded Nats pitcher delivers first NLCS win\n\nMan of the moment\n\nScherzer was not at his very best, walking a pair and running into some deep counts as his pitch total topped 39 after just two innings. But he settled in and gamely took the torch from Sanchez, who lost his no-hitter with two out in the eighth in Friday\u2019s Game 1.\n\nScherzer lost his when Paul Goldschmidt led off the seventh with a single, but that was quickly rendered moot when Scherzer elicited an inning-ending double play ball from Yadier Molina.\n\nIf the Sanchez-Scherzer punch felt familiar, there\u2019s a reason. Both flirted with no-hitters in Games 1-2 of the 2013 ALCS as members of the Detroit Tigers facing Boston. At that time, it was a pair of really good pitchers quieting an elite offense.\n\nThis time, it feels more like domination of an overmatched lineup.\n\nManager\u2019s special\n\nWhile Nationals pitching has been devastating, Cardinals manager Mike Shildt hasn\u2019t helped by managing his way into crucial tack-on runs for Washington. Saturday, he let Wainwright stay in to face lefty Adam Eaton despite allowing one-out singles to pinch hitter Matt Adams and leadoff man Trea Turner in the eighth inning.\n\nEaton made him pay with a two-run double to right; an intentional walk ended Wainwright\u2019s day before reliever Andrew Miller got the final two outs.\n\nAfter Taylor misplayed Jose Martinez\u2019s fly ball into an RBI double in the inning\u2019s bottom half, the game could have been tied. Instead, the hit merely cut Washington\u2019s lead to 3-1.\n\nMeanwhile, Nationals manager Dave Martinez summoned Game 4 starter Patrick Corbin \u2013 signed to a $140 million contract to round out the Nationals\u2019 dominant pitching staff \u2013 to get Wong for the first out in the bottom of the ninth. Closer Daniel Hudson \u2013 back from paternity leave \u2013 recorded the final two outs to nudge Washington closer to a pennant.\n\nAnd St. Louis to the edge of a winter spent pondering a punchless NLCS.", "description": "Max Scherzer took a no-hitter into the seventh and Michael A.
