The personnel must cover the six different instruments \u2013 from high bar to pommel horse \u2013 while showing off a range of moods: the sensitive one, the edgy one, the charismatic extrovert.\n\nJames Hall \u2013 a bone-dry 23-year-old from Maidstone \u2013 is the glue that holds the whole operation together. While the likes of Louis Smith and Nile Wilson love the spotlight, Hall prefers to lurk in the background, turning in precise and unflashy routines on at least five different pieces.\n\nIf he takes a medal at this week\u2019s World Championships in Stuttgart, it will probably be in the all-around category, because, as Hall cheerfully admits: \u201cI never really had any strong points as a youngster, I just kept plodding along.\u201d What is more likely, though, is that he will anchor Great Britain in their search for a team medal, something the men have achieved only once (a silver in 2015) since the World Championships were launched in 1903.\n\nIn this role, Hall resembles the now-retired Kristian Thomas, who captained the British team in Rio and delivered a killer vault to grab team bronze at London 2012. Neither came up through the junior ranks with much fanfare but both turned into the most dependable of all-rounders.", "description": "A good gymnastics team is like a boy band.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Michael Davison"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gymnastics/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000211880420-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqvf93cyop1gpr4w56dB_PHCVNHl9S--FzbjYEKI6ecJw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
