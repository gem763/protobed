During an interview on \u201cThe Talk\u201d Thursday, the \u201cJennifer\u2019s Body\u201d actress explained that her son is \u201creally into fashion\u201d and often gravitates to dresses when given the chance to pick his own outfit.\n\n\u201cSometimes, he\u2019ll dress himself and he likes to wear dresses, sometimes,\u201d Fox explained. \u201cAnd I send him to a really liberal, hippy school, but even there \u2013 here in California \u2013 he still has little boys going, \u2018Boys don\u2019t wear dresses,\u2019 or \u2018Boys don\u2019t wear pink.'\u201d\n\n'BH90210' STAR BRIAN AUSTIN GREEN SAYS HE WOULD'VE SKIPPED A STANDARD REBOOT\n\nShe continued: \u201cSo we\u2019re going through that now, where I\u2019m trying to teach him to be confident no matter what anyone else says.\u201d\n\nFox revealed that Noah was not wearing dresses for a brief time but recently returned to school wearing one.\n\n\u201cHe had stopped wearing dresses for a while. He just wore one two days ago to school, and he came home and I was like, \u2018How was it? Did any of the friends at school have anything to say?'\u201d Fox shared. \u201cAnd he was like, \u2018Well, all the boys laughed when I came in, but I don\u2019t care, I love dresses too much.'\u201d\n\nThe actress also noted that her son\u2019s love of dresses seems to come from an early fascination with fashion.\n\nMEGAN FOX HAD 'BREAKDOWN' AFTER MOVIE BOMBED, DIDN'T FEEL SUPPORTED BY FEMINISTS\n\n\u201cHe designs, he draws outfits. He\u2019s very talented,\u201d she told the hosts. \u201cBut he\u2019s still 6 so, when I do fittings, like, I did one recently and I had this really beautiful yellow dress on, and he kept draping it in a way where he\u2019s like, \u2018If we do it like this, it looks like a diaper!'\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s not what we\u2019re going for this time, but maybe next time!'\u201d\n\nFox herself is no stranger to being scrutinized by her peers. She recently spoke to Entertainment Tonight and described the crippling \u201cbreakdown\u201d she experienced after one of her movies bombed.\n\n\u201cI think I had a genuine psychological breakdown where I wanted just nothing to do,\" she confessed. \"I didn't want to be seen. I didn't want to have to take a photo, do a magazine, walk a carpet. I didn't want to be seen in public at all because... I believed that I was going to be mocked, or spat at, or someone was going to yell at me, or people would stone me or savage me for just being out and being whatever.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I didn\u2019t look perfect or I was too fat or too thin. I was stupid or I was offensive. I was a waste of space or a bad actress. Whatever you could think of, I anticipated experiencing that, because my belief system was that the world wasn't going to accept me, so I went through a very dark moment after that.\"\n\nAlthough she believes becoming a mother saved her from that darkness, she notes that it likely hurt her acting career as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Being a mother is not something really respected in this industry. If anything it's considered as a handicap,\" she said. \"And that's unfortunate because it's not acknowledged, what we're juggling, what we're doing.\"", "description": "Megan Fox revealed that her 6-year-old son Noah is maintaining his confidence after being laughed at for wearing dresses to school.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/2040eace-fox.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
