That could reach as many as seven million students.\n\nIn the schools, the Times\u2019 site won\u2019t display advertising and won\u2019t collect data from its users, but will feature some kind of Verizon branding, noting that it is the sponsor, said Mark Thompson, president and chief executive of New York Times Co. The program will be available to schools for two years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a heritage of trying to make the Times as useful as it can be to students, and this will include teaching tools that teachers can use in the classroom,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.\n\nHe said the Times won\u2019t count the program toward its overall subscriber totals, a measure that has been core to the media company\u2019s growth in recent years. The Times has set a target of 10 million total subscribers by 2025. It ended its last quarter with 4.7 million total subscriptions.\n\nThe companies declined to disclose the terms of the deal. It is part of a broad advertising relationship between Verizon and the Times which has in recent years moved to create more elaborate and lucrative ad deals that resemble corporate partnerships.\n\n\u201cIt is the biggest single relationship we have with any commercial partner at the moment,\u201d Mr. Thompson said of the larger partnership with Verizon.\n\nIn addition to a multimillion-dollar ad buy, Verizon and the Times have already partnered on a research project looking at how best to adapt 5G networking and equipment for use in reporting.\n\nVerizon said the partnership is an extension of its efforts to extend higher-speed broadband internet networks to schools in poorer and more rural areas of the country.\n\n\u201cHelping education is an area in which we are heavily invested,\u201d said Verizon Chief Executive Hans Vestberg. \u201cThis is how you advance social mobility and is very important to us.\u201d\n\nHe said Verizon intends to spend $400 million on such efforts over the next few years.\n\nThe Times has been betting big on subscriber growth as the overall advertising picture for media companies has eroded. Together, Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google and Facebook Inc. controlled 60% of the U.S. digital ad market last year, according to eMarketer Inc.\n\nMr. Thompson said while the program with Verizon wouldn\u2019t count toward its subscriber growth, it could pay dividends down the road as would help build brand awareness among younger audiences. Discounted student subscriptions and school programs have long been part of newspapers\u2019 efforts to establish lasting relationships with younger readers.\n\nThe Washington Post offers standard 50% discounts to university students and discounted bulk subscription packages for colleges and elementary schools. The Wall Street Journal also offers substantially discounted subscriptions to college students and low-cost, bulk packages for universities.\n\nWrite to Lukas I.
