Epstein's Paris flat was also searched.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor's office said Tuesday that investigators carried out searches over the past week at Karin Models, an agency in the high-end 8th arrondissement of Paris, and at Brunel's Paris home. The prosecutor's office would not provide further details of where things stand in the French investigation.\n\nBrunel was a frequent companion of Epstein who flew on his plane and visited him in jail in Florida, according to U.S. legal records.\n\nCobbe reports the searches were carried out at Epstein's home on Monday and at Karin Models on September 17 with a magistrate present. The prosecutor's office would not confirm if the FBI was present during the search.\n\nFrench police appealed earlier this month for victims and witnesses to come forward to aid their investigation into alleged rape of minors and other possible charges linked to the Epstein case.", "description": "French investigators search home and offices of French modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel in their probe into late financier Jeffrey Epstein's alleged sexual exploitation\u200b of women and girls", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/13/fa7e1f77-9f01-46a7-a90b-80288a176772/thumbnail/1200x630/951d58c08fa85941efe05729d7ecb361/jeffrey-epstein-03.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
