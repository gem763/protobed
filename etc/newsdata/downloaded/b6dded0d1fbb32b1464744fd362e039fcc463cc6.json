I must say, he's been absolutely fantastic,\" said one supporter, while another added: \"Saliba like a brick wall. Lyon attacks dying instantly when they come up against him. Cannot wait.\"\n\nAnother fan said: \"Got the perfect arrogance to his game, cannot wait for him to arrive\", and another tweet read: \"I cannot wait to see him play in an Arsenal shirt.\"\n\n(Image: Stuart MacFarlane)\n\nThere was more good news for the Arsenal defence, meanwhile, as manager Unai Emery confirmed previously-injured trio Kieran Tierney, Rob Holding and Hector Bellerin were all close to being fit for Premier League action.\n\nSpeaking after the Gunners' 1-0 win over Bournemouth Emery said: \"I think Rob Holding can play 90 minutes with a good performance. Now we are also working with David Luiz and Sokratis, but really, I am very happy. He is going to have a chance to play a lot of matches.\n\n\"Kieran Tierney is closer to us, he played on Thursday and today he was on the bench if we needed him. Hector Bellerin needs a little more time, more matches and more training.\"", "description": "The Gunners signed the French defender during the summer but immediately loaned him back to the Ligue 1 club", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Reuters", "Stuart Macfarlane"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20527727.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Ligue-1-AS-Saint-Etienne-vs-Olympique-Lyonnais.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
