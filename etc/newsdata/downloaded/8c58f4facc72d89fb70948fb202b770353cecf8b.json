Indeed, the first planet they found, 51 Pegasi b, orbits a sun 50 light years away that heats its surface to more than 1,000 degrees centigrade, the award-giving academy said.\n\nWith numerous ongoing searches for more exoplanets, this science might eventually also \u201cfind an answer to the eternal question of whether other life is out there,\u201d it said.\n\nGoran K Hansson (C), Secretary General of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and academy members Mats Larsson (L) and Ulf Danielsson, announce winners of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics during a news conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, Sweden, October 8, 2019.

Queloz also fielded inevitable questions about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that we\u2019re the only living entities in the universe,\u201d he said when asked if he believes \u201caliens\u201d exist. \u201cThe chemistry that led to life is everywhere, so I\u2019m a strong believer that there must be life elsewhere.\u201d\n\nDARK MATTER\n\nPeebles thanked the Nobel committee for the award, although he said his advice to young people wishing to go into science would be not to be lured by the prospect of such prizes.\n\n\u201cThe awards and prizes, well, they are charming and very much appreciated, but...you should enter science because you are fascinated by it. That\u2019s what I did,\u201d he told reporters by telephone after the award announcement.\n\nPhysics is the second Nobel to be awarded this week; William Kaelin, Gregg Semenza and Peter Ratcliffe shared the medicine prize on Monday for discoveries about how cells respond to oxygen levels.\n\nThe Nobel prizes were created in a bequest by Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901. This year\u2019s physics prize will be followed by the awards for chemistry on Wednesday, literature on Thursday and the peace prize on Friday.\n\nAmong the Nobels, physics has often taken centre stage with winners featuring some of the greatest names in the history of science such as Albert Einstein, Marie Curie and Niels Bohr, as well as inventors such as radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi.\n\nUsing theoretical tools and calculations, Peebles was able to interpret trace radiation from the infancy of the universe and discover new physical processes, the Nobel academy said.\n\nHe showed that matter readily seen around us, be it pebbles, mountains or stars, actually make up only 5%, with the rest made up of dark energy and dark matter.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nFor a graphic of Nobel laureates:\n\nhere", "description": "Canadian-American cosmologist James Peebles and Swiss scientists Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz won the 2019 Nobel Prize for Physics on Tuesday for revealing the wonder of the evolution of the universe and discovering planets orbiting distant suns.", "authors": ["Niklas Pollard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438398381&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970LB", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
