And the idea of NBC News taking a threat seriously from a tabloid company about Matt Lauer is especially preposterous, since they already covered him with great regularity.\"\n\nAn AMI spokesperson told Insider: \"The story presented by Mr. Farrow, while dramatic, is inaccurate.\"\n\nRepresentatives of Lauer sent Insider a lengthy statement responding to the allegations Wednesday morning, claiming the encounter was consensual.\n\nFarrow's stories about Weinstein in The New Yorker won a Pulitzer Prize, along with the reporting from Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey at The Times.
