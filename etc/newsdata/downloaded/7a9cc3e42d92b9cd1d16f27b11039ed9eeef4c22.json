Ever since he was 15, he knew his parents planned for him to attend Welch College in Gallatin \u2014 formerly Free Will Baptist Bible College.\n\nBut his decision to undergo the surgery in August led to him being outed to the college, and subsequently, a disciplinary committee suspended him for two years. If he wished to return, they said, he\u2019d face another committee.\n\nAlone in an unfamiliar country and town, Awtrey needed to find a place to live \u2014 and quickly.\n\nHe wound up in North Carolina at the home of his parents\u2019 friends, who allowed him to stay long enough to recover physically from the surgery.\n\nPreviously reported: Transgender student kicked out of Baptist college after surgery\n\nLast week, he returned to Nashville, to more family friends, despite everything that\u2019s happened. Here\u2019s why:\n\nA separation\n\nGrowing up in Bulgaria, surrounded by conservative Christians, Awtrey said he didn\u2019t meet an openly LGBT person until he was 18.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear the word transgender until I was online at 16,\u201d he said. \u201cI met my first openly transgender person when I was 18. That was an exciting moment for me. It shows how very protected and secluded I was.\"\n\nAwtrey continues to take hormones, and in a couple of weeks, he has a court hearing to legally change his name. That represents more to Awtrey than just a part of his physical transition.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a separation between my old life and my new life,\u201d he said.\n\nWho he is now has been a work in progress, Awtrey explained.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve kind of flip-flopped my mood,\u201d he said, adding he was feeling depressed, especially in the first few weeks after everything happened with school.\n\n\u201cIt was my general situation, where I suddenly didn\u2019t have any home security or job security or life security \u2013 just the basic things people need and worry about,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, Awtrey explained, he always prepared for this situation, and says he knew homelessness might be part of his journey.\n\n\u201cSo whenever I get in that sort of mood, I understand it's just something that needs to pass over, that I need to work through and process. I know things, both good and bad, are temporary.\u201d\n\nLGBTQ: Homeless shelters could deny transgender people under proposed Trump administration rule\n\nYanna Awtrey poses for a photo at the home he is temporally staying in on Oct. 3 in Nashville, Tenn. (Photo: Courtney Pedroza / The Tennessean )\n\nThe effect on his faith\n\nAwtrey said the experience with Welch College affected his faith \u2014 but in a positive way.\n\n\u201cI know there are people that call themselves Christians who wouldn\u2019t behave the way these people did.\n\n\u201cRight now I think I\u2019m in the best place I\u2019ve been emotionally and spiritually because \u2026 growing up inside that community where I couldn't speak about what was on my mind and \u2026 what kinds of opinions I held without suspicions being cast on me, right now I\u2019m separate from that, and so it\u2019s now opening up a lot of new conversations \u2026 It\u2019s made me dig deeper and I know myself more and I believe God more. And that relationship was a lot more fractured when I was closeted and living in Bulgaria.\"\n\nWhile he still feels some anger, he said he doesn\u2019t have a \u201cpersonal anger toward Welch College.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I need to spend time mulling over \u2026 every single aspect of what happened to me if it\u2019s not going to make me a better person or make me choose different things in life.\u201d\n\nA look from the outside\n\nYanna Awtrey was kicked out of Welch College in Gallatin, Tenn., while recovering from surgery. (Photo: Courtney Pedroza / The Tennessean )\n\nSince coming forward with his story, Awtrey said he\u2019s heard from many people offering support and kindness. Some of them are former Welch students.\n\n\u201cIntuitively, I knew that these sorts of things happen all the time, but it\u2019s another thing to read their stories in person and sort of connect to them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad to make them feel seen and heard, even through my (story).\u201d\n\nOne of the people who reached out was Nashville resident Kristine Kruczek Mains. One of Mains' children, 24-year-old Max, identifies as non-binary, and Mains said she strives to be an advocate. To her, that means actively seeking opportunities and relationships for people to be seen and heard, and participating in developing community awareness.\n\nMains said she wanted Awtrey to know he was not alone and that the person who is transitioning isn't really the one changing.\n\n\"They are who they have always been,\" she said. \"We're the ones who have to transform our thinking about how we see people.\"\n\nMains reiterated that people shouldn't have to explain or justify who they are to anyone.\n\n\"You are loved and you are lovable in God's eyes, period,\" she said. \"Anyone who sends you any message contrary to that is wrong.\"\n\nMax Mains said if they could share anything with someone going through a similar experience, it would be that \"it can feel really unfair. Like putting yourself out there in the world is essentially guaranteeing conflict.\"\n\n\"It's easy to really slide down into this dark place, questioning everything,\" they said.\n\nBut, Max Mains said, fight for yourself.\n\n\"You're responsible for the way you see your transitioning process, and you can see it as a really beautiful and complex act of self-protection and survival,\" they said. \"The parts that often get pinched in the outside world are actually the parts of yourself worth creating space for the most.\"\n\n'One step at a time'\n\nDespite all the positive messages, Awtrey said his actions have been \u201cminuscule.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, I just tell my story, and that\u2019s about it. It's just important to put a light on things that happen because otherwise nobody would talk about them \u2026 Instead of feeling more like I\u2019m separate because my story has been told, it feels more and more like I\u2019m interconnected to all these other \u2026 stories that have happened that haven\u2019t been talked about.\u201d\n\nAwtrey said he realizes that he will meet people who disagree with his choices no matter where he goes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same people, just different faces and different names.\u201d\n\nNashville actually feels like home, despite everything that's happened.\n\n\u201cNashville is the most ... pro-LGBT place I\u2019ve ever been,\" he said.\n\nAwtrey said he\u2019s planned for what has happened, and knows he\u2019ll be OK.\n\n\u201cI just have faith in my own stubbornness, in my own ability to be a cockroach and survive. \u2026 It\u2019s about what I imagined it would be and I mean, just one step at a time.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/08/transgender-student-kicked-baptist-welch-college-back-nashville/3906409002/", "description": "Two months after Yanna Awtrey was asked to leave Welch College in Gallatin, he's back in Nashville and legally changing his name.", "authors": ["Amy Nixon", "Published A.M.
