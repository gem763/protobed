The party that chose Johnson as its leader in July is mostly \u2014 but not unanimously \u2014 rallying behind a politician whose drive and energy have been stained by allegations of improper behavior and divisive political tactics.\n\nThe government said Johnson would send the formal proposals to EU leaders in Brussels on Wednesday after he rallies his party with a conference speech in Manchester, northwest England.\n\nJohnson\u2019s office said the prime minister will call the proposals a \u201cfair and reasonable compromise\u201d but also a final offer, and say that if the EU does not agree to discuss it, Britain would refuse to negotiate further.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get Brexit done \u2014 we can, we must and we will,\u201d he planned to say.\n\nAdvance extracts of Johnson\u2019s speech released by his office did not reveal the contents of the proposed deal, leaving an impatient EU to wait a little longer.\n\nBritain is due to leave the 28-nation bloc in just 30 days, and EU leaders are frustrated with the government\u2019s failure thus far to set out detailed plans for maintaining an open border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland \u2014 the key sticking point to a deal.\n\nJohnson says Britain will leave the EU on the scheduled Oct. 31 date with or without a deal, despite a law passed by Parliament that compels the government to seek a delay to Brexit if it can\u2019t get a deal by Oct. 19.\n\nA Brexit agreement between the EU and his predecessor, Theresa May, was rejected three times by the U.K. Parliament, largely because of opposition to the \u201cbackstop,\u201d an insurance policy designed to ensure there is no return to customs posts or other infrastructure on the Irish border.\n\nAn open border underpins both the local economy and Northern Ireland\u2019s peace process. But British Brexit supporters oppose the backstop because it would keep the U.K. tightly bound to EU trade rules in order to avoid customs checks \u2014 limiting the country\u2019s ability to strike new trade deals around the world.\n\nSo far, the U.K. has floated the idea of a common area for livestock and agricultural products, plus largely untested \u201ctechnological solutions\u201d as a replacement for the backstop. The EU says that is inadequate. Ireland has already rejected an idea raised in preliminary U.K. proposals for customs posts five to 10 miles (eight to 16 kilometers) away from the border.\n\nJohnson said Britain would not propose that idea, but added that it was a \u201creality\u201d that some checks would be needed to create a \u201csingle customs territory\u201d for the U.K.\n\nHe said checks could be conducted away from the border, possibly at either end of a shipment\u2019s journey.\n\n\u201cThat I don\u2019t think will be onerous, it certainly wouldn\u2019t involve infrastructure,\u201d he told Sky News.\n\nThat still falls short of the seamless border that exists today. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said that under May, the U.K. government \u201cpromised no hard border or associated controls or checks and we expect the British government to honor that promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople here don\u2019t want a customs border between north and south and no British government should seek to impose customs posts against the will of the people on the island of Ireland,\u201d he said in the Irish parliament.\n\nJohnson insists he wants to strike a deal with the EU to replace May\u2019s rejected Brexit agreement. He also says the U.K. can handle any bumps that come from tumbling out of the bloc without a deal, which would mean the instant imposition of customs checks and other barriers between Britain and the EU, its biggest trading partner.\n\nBut the U.K. government and businesses say the disruptions would be substantial.\n\nTrade Minister George Freeman told delegates at the Conservative conference that \u201cif we leave without a deal, it\u2019s going to be very bumpy.\u201d He said the flow of trade across the Channel between the English port of Dover and the French port of Calais \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s most important trade route \u2014 could be cut in half as customs and vehicle checks were introduced.\n\nAt the annual conference, Johnson is attempting to energize his party with all the bold policies he says the government will deliver once the U.K. manages to \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d \u2014 from more money for police, roads and housing to a big hike in the minimum wage. Tuesday\u2019s big theme, law and order, was slightly undermined when a Conservative lawmaker was ejected from the conference over an altercation that saw police swoop on a convention center lounge.\n\nThe costly policy promises, which break with a decade of deficit-slashing austerity by Johnson\u2019s Conservative predecessors, are also designed to appeal to voters in a national election that looks likely to be called within weeks.\n\nBut he is dogged by allegations that he handed out perks to a female friend\u2019s business while he was mayor of London and groped the thigh of a female journalist at a lunch two decades ago. Johnson denies impropriety in both cases \u2014 though said Tuesday that he couldn\u2019t remember the lunch in question.\n\nHe also suggested the allegations against him might motivated by political opponents trying \u201cto knock the government off course.\u201d\n\nJohnson is popular with many Conservative members, who welcome his energy and optimism after three years of Brexit gridlock under May. Some, though, have qualms about his personal conduct and his divisive tactics, which include using words like \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d about opponents of Brexit.\n\nDavid Gauke \u2014 a former Cabinet minister kicked out of the party group in Parliament for voting against the government over Brexit \u2014 said he feared that under Johnson, the Tories were becoming \u201ca much more aggressive, much more confrontational, much more divisive party.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are no longer the party of Churchill. We are more the party of Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nBut many conference delegates were supportive. Seena Shah, 30, who has been chosen as a Conservative election candidate in London, said she was pro-Brexit, socially liberal and comfortable with Johnson as leader.\n\n\u201cBoris, when he walks into a room, it fills with energy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is a fantastic leader. We need somebody who is going to keep the optimism up, and he is doing that very well.\u201d", "description": "After months of Brexit stalemate, Britain is finally about to play its hand, setting out Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cfinal offer\u201d for a last-minute...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP830_boris__ZG_20190821054807.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
