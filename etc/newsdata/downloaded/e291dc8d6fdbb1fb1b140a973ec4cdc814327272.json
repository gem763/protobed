Years later I found that other people were suffering at the same time.\n\n'For me I was suffering all that time with the pain. It took me ten years to deal with it,' he said of hiding his condition from family and friends.\n\nAt the height of his rugby career former England star Kyran Bracken said he was suffering from mental health problems which he later discovered was OCD\n\nKyran explained how he suffered in silence for many years with his mental health and was too 'embarrassed' to speak up and ask for help\n\nKyran told presenters Ben Shephard and Kate Garraway, that he had symptoms as far back as 2001, which he now knows was due to OCD.\n\n'I was getting these adrenaline rushes. I couldn\u2019t sleep, I had all these rituals\u2026 I didn\u2019t know then but I had OCD symptoms.'\n\nThe former Dancing on Ice contestant, who played rugby professionally for 14 years, added that he was going to the toilet 'about 80-90 times a night' and surviving on two-three hours of sleep.\n\n'I didn\u2019t join the dots and I was struggling to train. I was going to the toilet thinking if I go I can get to sleep. It got worse and worse.'\n\nHe was able to seek help through the Rugby Players' Association where he was prescribed medication and received therapy, but felt the need to keep it a secret because of the 'macho' rugby culture.\n\nKyran celebrating with the England Rugby Squad and coaching team after their win at the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final in Sydney Australia\n\nKyran went on to take part in Dancing on Ice in 2007 and said he was still battling with his mental health during the show\n\nKyran is hoping that by speaking up now and sharing how he eventually asked for help it will encourage others in the rugby world to be more open about their mental health.\n\n'OCD is about control and the more you try to control it the worse it gets. The more you fight it you have to become more accepting of the symptoms.'\n\nHe added that he didn't share his struggles because he thought it was a sign of weakness.\n\n'I'm still embarrassed to talk about it, as a macho rugby player the stigma is attached with it, but if I can talk about it so can others.'\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays on ITV from 6am", "description": "Kyran Bracken, 44, who was part of the famous World Cup-winning squad of 2003, has shared how he has suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) for over a decade.", "authors": ["Natalie Corner For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/11/19880196-0-image-a-21_1571395625484.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
