When I'm watching it back on TV I'm obviously happy with how I am because that's just who I am.\n\n\"I'm not going to name names, but there were definitely a lot of characteristics changed on and off camera. It was just very amped-up and more outspoken and a lot of cattiness purely because there was a camera in their face.\"\n\nYesterday, Lottie was told that the language she used in a WhatsApp chat was \"wholly unacceptable\" by the BBC in a statement.\n\n(Image: BBC/Boundless)\n\nIt has been reported that at least four contestants made official complaints after Lottie told Lubna Farhan to \"shut up Ghandi\" and threatened to \"f*** her up\".\n\nQuestioned about his take on the WhatsApp group remarks, Riyonn played down the drama and said: \"You've with 15 big personalities and everyone, talking, having their own opinion on stuff... you can't really guess what people are going to say.\"\n\nRiyonn said that he got on best with Thomas and Jemalin in the house.\n\n\"Thomas was my best mate,\" he said. \"He's a huge character but he's genuinely got a heart of gold.\"\n\nHe added: \"Jemalin hugged me for too long [after I was fired] that I had to walk back out and do it again!\"\n\n*The Apprentice returns next Wednesday at 9pm on BBC One", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Riyonn Farsad claimed that many of this year's stars changed their personalities when they were in front of the camera", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Image", "Digital Eroteme.Co.Uk", "Bbc", "Boundless", "Bbc Boundless", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20761337.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_18942258-high_res-the-apprentice-2019-series-15.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
