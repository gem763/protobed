Mark Milley are scheduled to brief the Senate Armed Services Committee on Syria and \u201cand the wider region\u201d behind closed doors Thursday, according to a committee notice.\n\nRepublicans are fuming after Trump decided to withdraw U.S. troops from northeast Syria, paving the way for Erdogan to move forward with a long-threatened offensive against Syrian Kurdish forces.\n\nAnkara considers the Syrian Kurds terrorists connected with a Turkish Kurdish insurgency. But the United States partnered with the Kurds in the fight against ISIS and relied on them to do the most dangerous ground fighting.\n\nLawmakers in both parties have called Trump\u2019s decision a betrayal of the Kurds and one that will send a chilling signal to any country or group that might want to ally itself with the United States in the future. They have also expressed concern that ISIS will take advantage of the chaos to escape from Kurdish-guarded prisons and regroup.\n\nWhile the condemnation has been bipartisan, the Republican criticism is particularly notable since it comes at a time when the GOP is vociferously defending Trump from House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut Syria has riled up Republicans like no other issue during Trump\u2019s presidency. When the president said in December he would withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria, there was an outcry from Republicans, and the Senate passed an amendment warning against the withdrawal in a veto-proof 68-23 vote. Trump eventually walked back his plan.\n\nAmid the latest backlash, Trump has sought to distance himself from Turkey\u2019s actions. On Thursday, he raised the possibility of playing of mediator between Turkey and the Kurds, despite the fact that Trump\u2019s retreat and Turkey\u2019s incursion unraveled the previous U.S.-mediated plan for a safe zone.\n\n\u201cWe can mediate. I hope we can mediate,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nHis administration has also sought to change the narrative. A senior State Department official told reporters on a background call this past week that \u201cwe gave them a very clear red light,\u201d while Esper told reporters Friday that \u201cnobody greenlighted this operation\u201d and insisted that \u201cwe have not abandoned the Kurds.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump approved expanding Treasury Department\u2019s authority to slap sanctions on Turkey, he declined later on the day Friday to specify what would prompt him to follow through with the sanctions threat.\n\nCongress may not give him any choice.\n\nSyria-related legislation was not included in guidance from McConnell's office about what will be taken up on the Senate floor this week. But Van Hollen has said he and Graham plan to introduce their bill as soon as Congress returns from recess and will push for an \u201cimmediate vote.\u201d\n\nThe Graham-Van Hollen bill would sanction any U.S. assets of high-ranking Turkish officials, including Erdo\u011fan, until the Trump administration certifies to Congress that Turkey has withdrawn from Syria. It would also place visa restrictions on Turkish leaders, sanction any foreign person supporting the Turkish military and ensure the previously congressionally mandated sanctions for Turkey\u2019s purchase of a Russian missile defense system go into effect.\n\nDuring an interview this past week with home-state radio station KBOI, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch James (Jim) Elroy RischMcConnell warns NBA to respect free speech on China Issa's Senate confirmation hearing delayed over concerns about background check Overnight Defense: GOP wary of action on Iran | Pence says US 'locked and loaded' to defend allies | Iran's leader rules out talks with US MORE (R-Idaho) said there is \u201ca growing feeling in the Congress that we ought to\u201d sanction Turkey.\n\n\"The most important question I think on the table right now is \u2026 do we take a move against Turkey based on economic sanctions,\u201d Risch said.\n\nRisch has not said whether he will support the Graham-Van Hollen bill, and a spokesman told The Hill on Friday he did not have an update on Risch\u2019s stance.\n\nSen.

I vehemently disagree with the president\u2019s decision.\"\n\nRep.

The measure would also prohibit arms sales to Turkey and sanction Ankara over its purchase of the Russian missile defense system.\n\nThe sanctions would apply until Trump certifies to Congress that Turkey has halted its Syria offensive.\n\nA separate bipartisan resolution released by Engel on Friday includes language saying the Kurds \"fought courageously\" with the United States against ISIS and that a withdrawal from northeast Syria is \"beneficial to adversaries\" like Syria, Iran and Russia.\n\nThe four-page resolution says the House \"opposes the decision to end certain United States efforts\" to prevent Turkey's offensive. It also calls on Erdogan to \"immediately cease\" the operation, says the United States should continue supporting the Kurds and calls for the U.S. to \"work to ensure that the Turkish military acts with restraint.\"\n\nIn a letter to House Democrats on Friday, Hoyer said it is possible the chamber will take up Syria legislation during this work period.\n\n\u201cBoth parties are outraged by the president\u2019s reckless and dangerous decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria and abandon our Kurdish allies,\u201d Hoyer wrote. \u201cIt is shameful that this president has betrayed a reliable ally, is enabling the return of ISIS and is putting our nation and other allies, including Europe and Israel, at risk.
