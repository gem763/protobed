GUSHES OVER TOM BRADY AHEAD OF CLEVELAND BROWNS' MATCHUP WITH NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS\n\n\u201cWell, one, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s complaining when it\u2019s blatantly obvious,\u201d the second-year quarterback said Wednesday, according to the Cleveland Plain-Dealer. \u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s just stating facts. Freedom of speech I thought, but that\u2019s OK, I get fined for it. It\u2019s the league, that\u2019s what they do. They fine you for some ridiculous things. That\u2019s just how it is. There\u2019s a reason that everybody is talking about it.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt goes for every team. We\u2019re not going to get a lot of calls, and we know that, especially going into this week. There\u2019s no time to worry about it. No time to stress about it. Just play our game.\u201d\n\nPHILADELPHIA EAGLES' FLETCHER COX GRABS SHOTGUN TO DEFEND HOME FROM GIRLFRIEND'S EX: REPORT\n\nAs Mayfield and the Browns prepare to take on the New England Patriots, the NFL sent a memo to all 32 teams reminding them that the league prohibits criticism of officiating, including posts on social media.\n\nHall of Fame executive Bill Polian told the Associated Press the league's loss of top referees such as Mike Pereira, Dean Blandino, John Parry, Terry McAulay and Gene Steratore has hurt the officiating.\n\n\u201cThere is no question about that, none whatsoever,\u201d Polian said. \u201cI mean, you're talking about this year alone, Terry McAulay, John Parry, Gene Steratore, I mean, they'd be in the top five in any given year that they worked. And they're referees on top of that, so they know all the rules, they know all the interpretations; they understand what goes on at virtually every position. And then Ed Hochuli's retirement, you lose him and the three others, that's four of your top five referees by anybody's standard.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nHe added that their departures mean there are less-experienced referees trying to navigate players\u2019 egos along with an ever-changing rulebook.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield had no regrets over the fine he received for criticizing officials following the team\u2019s Week 6 loss to the Seattle Seahawks.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
