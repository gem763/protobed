He reported his objections again after the 25 July call.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump impeachment: Last week was the most dramatic so far\n\n\"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen,\" Col Vindman says in the statement. \"I was worried about the implications for the US government's support of Ukraine.\"\n\nHe said having that country look into the Bidens would \"undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained\".\n\n\"This would all undermine US national security,\" he added.\n\nA dangerous game\n\nWhen acting US Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor offered sharp testimony last week, the White House's response was to paint the diplomat as a \"radical unelected bureaucrat waging war on the US constitution\".\n\nSuch a label will be harder to pin on Col Vindman. Both he and Mr Taylor have outlined what they saw as inappropriate White House efforts to pressure Ukraine. Unlike Mr Taylor, however, Col Vindman was a first-hand witness to many of the Washington episodes central to the impeachment investigation, including Donald Trump's controversial call.\n\nAlready there is evidence that the White House line of attack will be to question the allegiance of the Soviet-born Col Vindman, note that the decorated officer spoke to Ukrainian diplomats in their native tongue and suggest that he was working to subvert White House interests.\n\n\"Some people might call that espionage,\" former Bush administration lawyer John Yoo said on Fox News. Making such allegations is a very dangerous game. Col Vindman appears to be a compelling witness. If it's his word against the president's, the public may feel sympathetic to the soldier in uniform whose patriotism is being disparaged.\n\nWhat's the latest on the impeachment inquiry?\n\nJust hours after Col Vindman gave evidence, Democrats in the US House of Representatives published a resolution that sets out the next steps in their investigation.\n\nThe House, where the Democrats are in a majority, will vote on the measure on Thursday.\n\nIt sets out a formal structure for the congressional committees' inquiry into whether there are grounds to remove President Trump from office.\n\nResponding to the resolution, the White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called it an \"illegitimate sham\".\n\nWhat's the reaction?\n\nAs the testimony was due to begin, Mr Trump suggested Col Vindman was a \"Never Trumper witness\" in a tweet.\n\nOther conservatives have also attacked Col Vindman's credibility because he was born in Ukraine - though some have since defended the veteran officer.\n\nRepublican congresswoman Liz Cheney denounced these gibes as \"shameful\" at a news conference with other House Republican leaders.\n\nBut many other Republicans stood by Mr Trump. House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy said Col Vindman was \"wrong\".\n\n\"Nothing in that phone call is impeachable,\" he said.\n\nWho is Col Vindman?\n\nIn 2018, Col Vindman joined the security council under former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who was fired by Mr Trump earlier this year.\n\nHis family fled the Soviet Union in 1979, when he was three years old. He has served in the military for two decades as an active officer and diplomat.\n\nAs an infantry officer, he was deployed to Iraq - where he was wounded and received the Purple Heart military award.\n\nCol Vindman later served at US embassies in Ukraine and Russia.", "description": "A decorated army veteran who listened in on the call that sparked the impeachment inquiry testifies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0694/production/_109448610_tv057636303.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
