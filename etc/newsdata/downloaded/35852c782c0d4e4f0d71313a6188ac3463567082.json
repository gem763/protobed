Part of his appeal, the students said, was that Buttigieg wasn\u2019t trying to appeal to them.\n\nThe 37-year-old Democrat solidified his standing in the 2020 contest when he took in a $7 million fundraising haul in the first quarter of the year. On Wednesday, he staked out policy positions on higher education and health care, reflected on being a millennial in elected office, and spoke about religion and his military service during the hourlong talk.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhen Northeastern initially planned Buttigieg\u2019s visit to Boston nine weeks ago, organizers set aside a room that fits around 200 people. As interest in the candidate\u2019s talk grew, the school moved the event to an auditorium that could accommodate 500 people and eliminated the need for tickets. The expanded event still drew an overflow crowd. More than an hour before Buttigieg took the stage, hundreds of people stood in a line that stretched around the building.\n\nHe spoke with moderator Kimberly Atkins of public radio station WBUR for half an hour. When Atkins opened the conversation up to a question-and-answer period, there was a mad dash for several microphones stationed throughout the auditorium. Nearly two dozen people stood in line at each microphone while Buttigieg took questions for 30 minutes.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201904/2344/1155968404_6021220071001_6020982892001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nOn policy, Buttigieg talked about a \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d option that would ease consumers into public health care. He also called for a new generation of politicians, and suggested that Democrats should reclaim the idea of \u201cfreedom\u201d from Republican and Libertarian messaging.\n\n\u201cFreedom for me has depended on the ability to get health care, the ability to marry the person I love, the ability to hold financial institutions accountable,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nThe South Bend mayor drew applause when he spoke about his support for the \u201cframework\u201d of the Green New Deal, about his husband, Chasten, and when he called the Electoral College \u201ca dumb idea.\u201d At one point, the moderator asked the crowd to hold its applause so Buttigieg could get to more of their questions. While they stopped clapping, many in the crowd continued to snap their fingers in support.\n\nButtigieg, a veteran who served in Afghanistan, said his generation would deal with damage done by the war in Iraq for decades, and that it \u201cnever should have happened.\u201d He sees the military as one part of a broader national security structure.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

He said religion is a \u201cpositive force\u201c in his life but attributed some of the skepticism young people have around religion to politics.\n\n\u201cThe impression a lot of people in our generation got of religion was intervention of religion in the political space designed to constrain our freedom,\u201d he said, mentioning abortion-rights issues and LGBTQ equality. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like religious leaders were on our side.\u201d\n\nButtigieg is aware of the hunger for authenticity in politics among young voters, telling the Northeastern audience that millennials \u201chave a really finely tuned antenna for hypocrisy.\u201d He took a notably more moderate stance on tuition-free college compared with some 2020 Democratic candidates, especially Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. While Buttigieg supports lowering the cost of a higher education, he said, he doesn\u2019t support making college free.\n\n\u201cAmericans who have a college degree earn more than Americans who don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a progressive, I have a hard time getting my head around the idea of a majority who earn less because they didn\u2019t go to college subsidizing a minority who earn more because they did.\u201d\n\nAnd though tuition-free college has been something of a rallying cry for progressive Democrats, especially millennials, since the 2016 election, Buttigieg\u2019s answer impressed many of the college students in the audience.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it that way, but it was a really thoughtful and good point,\u201d said Ben Vanderlan, 22.\n\nYael Sheinfeld, president of the Northeastern University College Democrats, said: \u201cHe stayed true to himself and had obviously thought through something he thought was a more logical solution to the problem and didn\u2019t just say the political buzzwords that he knows will get support from college students or progressive liberals.\u201d Sheinfeld previously supported former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, another Democrat in the race, but feels Buttigieg embodies what she felt she was \u201csettling for\u201d in other candidates.\n\nTo remedy the student debt crisis and the cost of college, Buttigieg instead suggested looking at Pell Grants, states covering a higher proportion of the cost of education than students, a more generous and accessible program for loan forgiveness, and looking at interest rates to refinance loans.\n\nThough 19-year-old Milton Posner shares the progressive views of candidates like Sanders and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California, he said Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cpragmatic solutions\u201d would be easier to achieve than \u201clofty goals\u201d or taking \u201cone massive swipe\u201d on issues. Warren, for example, calls for making \u201csystemic change\u201d in Washington on the campaign trail. Sanders often calls for a political revolution.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m struggling to remember a time I was more impressed by a politician,\u201d Posner said. \u201cThis was a \u2018wow\u2019 kind of thing.\u201d\n\nWhen a reporter asked the mayor a question in Italian, Buttigieg responded in Italian and carried out a conversation in the language for around two minutes.
