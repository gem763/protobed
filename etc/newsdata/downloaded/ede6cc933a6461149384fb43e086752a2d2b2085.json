War is brutal.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, Twitter was bewildered by the fact that Curtis felt the need to draw attention to Baghdadi\u2019s suffering, given that the former Islamic State leader was himself responsible for inflicting much death and suffering in his time.\n\nMany drew the conclusion that anti-Trump liberals simply could not permit Trump to have any kind of win whatsoever \u2014 so much so that they would seemingly rather defend a terrorist than give him credit for any success.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Actor does job\u2019: Fox News gun control hit piece on Jamie Lee Curtis backfires spectacularly\n\n\u201cTrump did it. He made them defend Baghdadi,\u201d writer for the conservative Federalist magazine Erielle Davidson tweeted.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s actually trying to garner sympathy for a terrorist who was responsible for murdering people in absolutely horrific ways, all because she hates Trump,\u201d another user wrote.\n\nDefending a terrorist, child killer, serial rapist and mass murderer to own the DRUMPF. Welcome to the #resistance. https://t.co/0X1fR8uMoU \u2014 Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) October 28, 2019\n\nAnother tweeter told Curtis she was \"destroying a lifetime of respect earned excelling at your craft\u201d by publicly sharing such an \u201cinsane\u201d thought.\n\nImagine destroying a lifetime of respect earned excelling at your craft by publicly demonstrating how insane your thoughts are. Wow. Seriously JLC? Need to get out of that bubble you are trapped in. \u2014 Joel Comm (@joelcomm) October 27, 2019\n\nPollster Nate Silver said it was \"amazing\" how many liberals could not allow Trump to have even one good day \"after US forces kill perhaps the world's most wanted terrorist.\"\n\nIt really amazing how many Libs can't even permit Trump to have *one good day* (nobody will remember this stuff by Tuesday) after US forces kill perhaps the world's most wanted terrorist. \u2014 Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) October 27, 2019\n\nOthers pointed out that the raid was named after Kayla Mueller, the American hostage who was tortured and raped by IS militants, including Baghdadi himself, before being killed. Curtis was advised to Google Mueller\u2019s name and \u201cfind out why you owe her parents a deep apology for being so incredibly ignorant.\u201d\n\nCurtis managed to end her tweet somewhat less controversially, noting that dogs are \u201cbrave, bold, loyal, loving and healing\u201d \u2013 a reference to Trump\u2019s comment that the brutal IS leader \u201cdied like a dog and a coward.\u201d Twitter was flooded with comments questioning Trump\u2019s repeated references to people \u201cdying,\u201d being \u201cfired\u201d or being \u201cdumped\u201d like a dog.\n\nHey @EricTrump, your dad will never adopt him because he hates dogs, that is obvious given how he always makes negative comparisons to dogs.\n\n\n\n\u201cdied like a dog\u201d\n\n\u201cfired like a dog\u201d\n\n\u201cdropped like a dog\u201d\n\n\u201cdumped like a dog\u201d\n\n\u201clies like a dog\u201d\n\n\u201cbegs like a dog\u201d\n\n\u201ccheated like a dog\u201d \u2014 \u30ea\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30c9\uff01 (@RichardGJP) October 28, 2019\n\n\u201cNo disrespect to the president, but with all his \u201cfired like a dog\u201d and \u201cdied like a dog\u201d talk, if I were a shelter I would not let him adopt,\u201d one conservative columnist mused.\n\nNo disrespect to the president, but with all his \u201cfired like a dog\u201d and \u201cdied like a dog\u201d talk, if I were a shelter I would not let him adopt. \u2014 Frank J. Fleming (@IMAO_) October 27, 2019\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s colorful description of Baghdadi\u2019s final moments, Moscow has remained sceptical of the raid\u2019s outcome \u2013 and whether it took place at all. Trump, however, has promised to release some video evidence of the operation, even if partially.\n\nLike this story?
