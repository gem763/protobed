In a tweet late Monday, Mr. Falih called the move \u201can important step to prepare the company for the public offering.\u201d Mr. Falih will continue to serve as energy minister.\n\nAramco is elevating Yasir al-Rumayyan to its chairmanship, Mr. Falih said in his tweet. Mr. Rumayyan is head of the Public Investment Fund, the country\u2019s primary sovereign-wealth fund, and a key ally of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What implications could a weakened Saudi economy have for the rest of the Middle East? Join the conversation below.\n\nAramco declined to comment. The Saudi energy ministry wasn\u2019t immediately available to comment.\n\nFor Aramco observers, the change signaled a new sense of urgency in moving ahead with the public listing. Prince Mohammed has long pushed for an IPO of as much as 5% of Aramco\u2014formally called the Saudi Arabian Oil Co.\u2014the world\u2019s biggest oil producer and most profitable company, for which he has advocated an overall valuation of some $2 trillion. That would amount to the world\u2019s biggest-ever public offering, despite representing such a small sliver of the oil giant.\n\nBut plans stalled last year over matters like valuation and the venue for such a listing, and restarted in earnest only recently. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Aramco is currently considering a listing in two stages, offering a portion of its shares on the Saudi stock exchange later this year and following up with an international offering in 2020 or 2021.\n\nMr. Falih has been the public face of the listing effort, and one of the chief architects and cheerleaders of Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambitious plan to more broadly diversify its economy beyond oil under Prince Mohammed. Some people familiar with the matter said, though, that the crown prince has more recently held Mr. Falih responsible for the lack of advancement in some of those diversification efforts.\n\nMr. Falih, a former CEO and longtime executive of Aramco, has sometimes been seen as more cautious about the prospects of an IPO. He tried to dissuade Prince Mohammed in 2016 from any plan to list shares of the company. While he lost that argument, the large Saudi energy bureaucracy that sits under Mr. Falih ultimately succeeded in slowing the march toward a listing by arguing an IPO could expose the company to unwanted scrutiny and potential legal jeopardy, the Journal has reported.\n\nMr. Falih\u2019s removal \u201cshows the seriousness of the Aramco listing\u201d this time around, said Helima Croft, chief commodities strategist at Canadian bank RBC. Prince Mohammed \u201cis moving his team into place to get this done.\u201d\n\nMr. Falih\u2019s loss of the Aramco chairmanship represents the latest diminishment of his once-formidable grip on Saudi economic policy. Until recently, in addition to his position at the top of the kingdom\u2019s oil-policy bureaucracy, Mr. Falih presided over a wide swath of Saudi economic planning. Last week, he lost two portfolios, over industrial and mining policy.\n\nHis removal as Aramco chairman could help analysts and investors better distinguish between the energy ministry\u2014which Mr. Falih will continue to lead\u2014and the state-run oil company, according to people familiar with the matter. International bankers are meeting this week with Aramco executives and Saudi officials to pitch them on advising on the IPO.\n\nThe move coincides with a larger shake-up among key decision makers in Saudi Arabia. A government reshuffling announced late Friday included replacing the powerful head of the Saudi royal court with an official seen as closer to the crown prince.\n\nPrince Mohammed became crown prince after his father King Salman upended the royal line of succession, replacing the previous crown prince in 2017. Since then, the young royal has vastly expanded his power within the Saudi state, sidelining potential rivals in the royal family and arresting activists, writers and other critics of the government.\n\nThe crown prince\u2019s plans to steer the Saudi economy away from oil by boosting sectors like tourism and manufacturing stalled partly as he consolidated power and moved against challengers. That crackdown shattered Prince Mohammed\u2019s international image and complicated efforts to attract foreign investment and business partnerships. In 2017, the kingdom jailed dozens of businessmen and other elite Saudis in what it billed as a corruption clampdown, forcing some to give up assets in return for their freedom.\n\nThen, in 2018, Saudi operatives murdered the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom\u2019s consulate in Istanbul, triggering a global backlash against the Saudi government and causing some foreign businesses to stay away.\n\nWrite to Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com, Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Jared Malsin at jared.malsin@wsj.com", "description": "Saudi Arabia is removing Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih as chairman of its state-owned oil giant, a surprise shift as plans for an initial public offering accelerate.", "authors": ["Benoit Faucon", "Summer Said", "Jared Malsin"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103315/social"}
