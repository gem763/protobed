Nutrition scientists say not so fast.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\n(Laura Chase de Formigny for The Washington Post)\n\nA study released Monday greenlighting the consumption of processed and red meat has much of the medical community seeing red.\n\nA bad diet is the number one cause of poor health, and increasingly the bony finger of accusation has been pointed at this particular part of our plate. This year, the EAT-Lancet Commission report, the special report on climate change and land by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a British Medical Journal study associated increases in red meat consumption with mortality in American men and women. Meanwhile, plant-based protein companies such as Impossible Burger and Beyond Meat have begun to win consumers\u2019 affections.\n\nIn the midst of this, a new study suggests quite the opposite.\n\nGuidelines published in the Annals of Internal Medicine say there\u2019s no need to reduce red or processed meat consumption for good health. Based on five systematic reviews of the relationship between meat consumption and health, a panel of researchers from Dalhousie and McMaster universities in Canada, with the Iberoamerican and Polish Cochrane centers, says that most people can continue to consume red meat and processed meat at their average consumption levels.\n\n[A spoonful less sugar, tad more fat: US diets still lacking]\n\nAnalyzing the data from five studies that encompassed 54,000 people, the researchers did not find a significant association between meat consumption and the risk of heart disease, diabetes or cancer. They also found a vegetarian diet provided few, if any, health benefits.\n\nGiven the enthusiasm among meat eaters for steaks and burgers, the impacts would have to be much greater to suggest curtailing red and processed meat, said Bradley Johnston, associate professor in the department of community health and epidemiology at Dalhousie University and the lead researcher on the study.\n\nJohnston acknowledged the study\u2019s recommendations are contrary to almost all other guidelines that exist.\n\nIndeed, many nutrition and health scientists were gobsmacked by the panel\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re collectively appalled that this is being pushed in the way that it\u2019s being pushed. It just adds to the confusion for patients,\u201d says Elizabeth Klodas, a cardiologist and member of the American College of Cardiology's nutrition group. \u201cThe conclusions are not the conclusions of the medical community. They were selective in the studies included and the weight they gave them.\u201d\n\nShe makes an analogy. She says it\u2019s like comparing heavy smoking to moderate smoking over a relatively short period of time and concluding that, \u201cfrankly, \u2018people have a hard time quitting smoking, so let\u2019s just let them smoke.\u2019 We eat 220 pounds of meat per person per year in this country. That\u2019s 15 servings a week. And you\u2019re going to tell Americans, just keep going? Today we\u2019re spending $315 billion per year treating heart disease; on our current trajectory, it will be nearly $800 billion by 2035.\u201d\n\n[The longevity files: A strong grip? Push-ups? What actually can help you live to a ripe old age.]\n\nAnother critic of the study, Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the Annals of Internal Medicine study also ignored solid science in the arena.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to review the evidence, you have to look at all bodies of relevant data. Why did they ignore that vast body of data of carefully controlled randomized studies?\u201d asks Willett, pointing to studies that show that, compared to plant sources of protein, red meat increases blood levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, which consistently predict a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. He cited studies such as the Lyon Diet Heart Study, one that was not considered in the new study.\n\nHe added the study did not weigh in on what people ate instead of red meat.\n\n\u201cIf you replace a portion of red meat with all the other unhealthy foods in our diet, you are comparing red meat consumption to the consumption of that, which may show negligible results,\u201d Willet said, adding that it\u2019s important to replace that meat with a healthy, plant-based protein source.\n\nBonnie Liebman, director of nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, says one of the study\u2019s chief flaws is its reliance on the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study, a huge analysis of 48,000 women that had half the participants eating their regular diet and half eating a \u201clow-fat diet,\u201d which in many cases led to a half an ounce difference in meat consumption per day in the two groups, about a fifth of a hamburger. No surprise, there wasn\u2019t much difference in outcomes. Because of its size, the women\u2019s study may have skewed the overall results of the Annals of Internal Medicine report.\n\nThe debate over red meat comes as the U.S. government is working on its 2020 dietary guidelines, which informs which foods are served in school lunches, nursing homes, hospitals and food assistance programs, in addition to providing the framework for how doctors speak to their patients about what foods to eat.\n\nAhead of the influential findings, the low-carb paleo/keto/Atkins faction of nutrition science is vying against those advocating a more plant-based approach for a place on the American dinner table.\n\n[How the Trump administration limited the scope of the USDA\u2019s 2020 dietary guidelines]\n\nJohnston had this to say of the study\u2019s critics: \u201cRegarding the reaction among some in the nutrition research community \u2026 we are sympathetic to the discomfort of acknowledging the low-quality evidence in one\u2019s field. It seems to us, however, that pretending that the rules of evidence differ across fields because the feasibility of definitive studies is not possible in one\u2019s particular field is a poor solution to the problem. We believe it is important to apply common standards for assessing the certainty of evidence across health-care fields.\u201d\n\nJohnston\u2019s team did not consider ethical or environmental reasons for abstaining. They found that people ate meat because they liked it or perceived it as healthy and would be reluctant to change their habits.\n\nWillett says the panel\u2019s conclusions and recommendations do not reflect the study\u2019s findings. Their meta-analyses of large cohorts showed that dietary patterns with a moderate reduction in red and processed meat consumption were associated with lower total mortality by 13 percent. If a drug brought down the number of deaths to that degree, he says, it would be heralded as a success.\n\n\u201cMeat is something people make decisions about in their own life every day,\u201d Willett says. \u201cThe biggest cost [to studies like these] is people will throw up their hands and say nutritional science doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s talking about.\u201d", "description": "The study comes amid warring factions between low-carb advocates and those arguing for a plant-based diet.
