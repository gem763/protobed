We will not hesitate to take necessary action against anyone who deliberately chooses to act outside the law.\u201d\n\nSenior police officers have been calling for politicians and other political figures to avoid worsening tensions with inflammatory language.\n\nMartin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, issued a warning over the \u201cincredibly febrile atmosphere\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a position where you know you\u2019re going to be listened to, you need to be very careful about the language you are using so it doesn\u2019t end up with consequences that weren\u2019t intended,\u201d he urged.\n\nLast month, the head of UK counterterror policing said all public figures should be \u201cbringing society together\u201d as Brexit worsens polarisation.\n\n\u201cWe should be really careful about what we say, we should be balanced, because there is no doubt in my mind that it has an effect,\u201d assistant commissioner Neil Basu previously told The Independent.\n\nThe prime minister has been forced to defend remarks where he compared Muslim women to \u201cletterboxes\u201d last year after research suggested they caused a 375 per cent rise in Islamophobic hate crimes.\n\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said the comments had been part of a \u201cstrong liberal defence of everybody\u2019s right to wear whatever they want in this country\u201d, and refused to apologise.\n\nIn the same session, he characterised a bill proposed by opposition parties to prevent a no-deal Brexit as a move against the \u201cdemocratic will of the people of the UK\u201d.\n\nMr Johnson described the proposed law as a \u201csurrender bill\u201d eight times during the session, and the term was then repeated by extremists.\n\nExperts said the prime minister and some other pro-Brexit politicians were \u201cusing the language of the far right\u201d and playing into extremist narratives.\n\nChloe Colliver, who leads the digital research unit at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue think-tank, said that by using the phrase \u201csurrender bill\u201d and positioning himself as enacting the \u201cwill of the people\u201d, Mr Johnson was \u201ccalling successfully to a nationalist interpretation of the Brexit debate\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt seems very purposeful to me and it really harks back to the Second World War nostalgia in this debate, which plays powerfully to the far right and nationalist groups,\u201d she told The Independent.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand the mechanisms and decisions being made on their behalf, and that\u2019s a ripe opportunity for these groups to step in with a simple narrative that pits them against everyone else.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson is currently receiving substantial support from key far-right figures, including former Britain First leader Jayda Fransen, who praised him for \u201cpurging the traitors\u201d in his party and called on others to fall behind him.\n\nThe operators of Tommy Robinson\u2019s official Telegram channel called on people to \u201cback Boris\u201d, while supporters shared memes depicting him as Winston Churchill.\n\nMs Colliver warned that if the far right feel Mr Johnson is \u201cin their corner\u201d, it may reduce unrest in the short term but make them feel that their ideals have mainstream support.\n\nShe said the political stalemate over Brexit was undermining faith in democratic processes, and being \u201cused to channel violent undemocratic objectives to a newly broad and receptive audience in the UK.\u201d\n\nDr Joe Mulhall, senior researcher at Hope Not Hate, said far-right groups had seized upon Brexit as a nationalist cause and used it to gain mainstream support.\n\nHe said the global extreme right-wing had celebrated the result of the 2016 referendum, but then worked the following delays into a \u201cnarrative of betrayal\u201d by \u201celites\u201d.\n\n\u201cTheir sense of betrayal could well spill out into anger and violence,\u201d Dr Mulhall said. \u201cThey want no deal but if things go terribly it will be blamed on politicians, or the corrupt elite or global powers. Whatever the outcome is, they will be outraged.\u201d", "description": "Far-right groups are threatening to riot over Brexit amid warnings that some of Boris Johnson\u2019s language is \u201ccalling to\u201d nationalists.
