Photos republished by Time magazine show Trudeau dressed as Aladdin at an Arabian Nights-themed party in 2001 and as a black person singing \"Day O\" at a high school talent show. The controversy has reignited conversations about racism and white privilege.\n\n\n\nBlackface, though, isn't just an embarrassing episode of the past. It continues to appear in popular culture, media and advertising around the world. Blackface characters in Europe, including \"Black Pete\" in the Netherlands and Belgium's \"Le Sauvage\", have sparked protest from anti-racism activists and raised questions over how these traditions impact their respective communities of colour.\n\n\n\nBlackface started in the United States in 19th-century minstrel shows where white actors donned black makeup to demean African Americans. The practice was accepted as mainstream American entertainment and became a cultural export.\n\n\n\nWe'll discuss the legacy of blackface and learn more about its roots in racism.\n\n\n\nOn this episode of The Stream, we speak with:\n\n\n\nJerry Afriyie @TheRebelThePoet\n\nPoet and human rights activist\n\nnederlandwordtbeter.nl\n\n\n\nCharmaine Nelson\n\nProfessor of art history, McGill University\n\nblackcanadianstudies.com\n\n\n\nLeila Day @leiladayleila\n\nHost & producer of \"The Stoop: Stories from the Black Diaspora\"\n\nthestoop.org\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nCanada's surprising history of blackface - The Atlantic\n\nHow blackface - \u2018America\u2019s first cultural export\u2019 - reinforces oppression across the world - PRI\n\nWhat do you think?
