Mazlum Abdi, the head of the Syrian Democratic Forces, tweeted that al-Muhajir was killed in an operation coordinated between his forces and the U.S.\n\nOn Saturday, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a raid in Syria.

His last statement was released in March, when he urged followers to retaliate against mosque attacks in New Zealand, which left 50 dead.
