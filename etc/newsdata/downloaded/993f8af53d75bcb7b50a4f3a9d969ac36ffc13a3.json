(Brian Snyder/Reuters)\n\nWith over three months to go until the all-important Iowa caucuses, Mayor Pete\u2019s anti-Warren pivot has given his campaign new life.\n\nIt\u2019s usually against best practices to telegraph a punch, but Pete Buttigieg knew what he was doing when he previewed his attack against Elizabeth Warren in a digital ad bashing Medicare for All ahead of last week\u2019s debate. The ad predictably prompted debate moderators to pit the South Bend, Ind., mayor against Senator Elizabeth Warren, the race\u2019s front-runner. When asked at the debate, Warren refused to say that Medicare for All would require raising taxes on the middle class, and Buttigieg deftly hit her for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWell, we heard it tonight: a yes-or-no question that didn\u2019t get a yes-or-no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nHe then struck a populist note in attacking Warren\u2019s plan to abolish private health insurance for all Americans: \u201cI don\u2019t think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if voters will think that the 37-year-old mayor of a small city in Indiana passes the commander-in-chief test, but Buttigieg staked out a relatively responsible position on foreign policy within the Democratic party during the debate: against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but also against President Trump\u2019s betrayal of America\u2019s Kurdish allies in Syria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence. It\u2019s a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values,\u201d Buttigieg said during an exchange with the staunchly non-interventionist Tulsi Gabbard. \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan. But it\u2019s also the case that a small number of specialized, special-operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we\u2019re seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe strong debate performance hasn\u2019t really helped Buttigieg much in the national polls: He is still sitting at about 7 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics national average, up about 1 point since the debate. But with little more than 100 days until the Iowa caucuses, he is definitely in contention to win the crucial first contest. On Thursday morning, an Iowa State University poll showed him surging into second place with 20 percent support in Iowa, behind Warren at 28 percent and ahead of Bernie Sanders (18 percent) and Joe Biden (12 percent). The RCP average of Iowa polls now shows a tighter race with Warren at 22.5 percent, Biden at 18.8 percent, Buttigieg at 15.8 percent, and Sanders at 15.3 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimply by turning Iowa into a four-way race, Buttigieg has made the Democratic primary more unpredictable. The last four Democratic presidential nominees each won Iowa. Yes, Democrats award their delegates proportionally, but momentum matters, and there\u2019s nothing quite so persuasive in a large intra-party fight as an early victory. \u201cI think Iowa is much more important this cycle than it\u2019s been in any of the other cycles I\u2019ve been in,\u201d veteran Democratic campaign consultant Joe Trippi tells National Review. \u201cSomebody comes out of Iowa, they\u2019re likely to be a rocket ship, particularly if it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d\n\nA victory in Iowa, of course, is no guarantee that Buttigieg would ultimately win the nomination. David Catanese wrote this week in The State that Buttigieg campaign focus groups in South Carolina show him struggling to gain any support among African-American Democratic primary voters, in part because he\u2019s openly gay. A victory in Iowa could help ease concerns about Buttigieg\u2019s electability, just as Barack Obama\u2019s early victory in Iowa helped assuage Democratic fears that it would be risky to make Obama the first African-American major-party presidential nominee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, it would appear to be harder for Buttigieg to parlay an Iowa victory into a win in South Carolina than it was for Obama in 2008 or would be for Joe Biden, Cory Booker, or Kamala Harris this cycle. Buttigieg\u2019s sexual orientation isn\u2019t the only thing limiting his support to wealthier, more educated, white Democrats; he\u2019s also hampered by the fact that he\u2019s often really boring. Obama could unite a winning Democratic coalition by playing the roles of both professor and preacher; Buttigieg only seems to know how to be the former. The mayor also isn\u2019t really as moderate as he now wants you to think. Barack Obama said he supported banning late-term abortion, but Buttigieg opposes any legal limits on abortion. Buttigieg would not strip churches, synagogues, and mosques of their tax-exempt status for refusing to perform same-sex marriages, but he would use the power of the state to crush traditional religious schools and other institutions that uphold their faith\u2019s teachings on sex, gender, and marriage. He also wants to remake the Supreme Court, increasing the number of justices from nine to 15.\n\nThat said, Buttigieg does have a few things going for him. His campaign has $23 million in the bank, nearly as much as Warren\u2019s and twice as much as Biden\u2019s. What\u2019s more, a huge portion of the field \u2014 Senators Warren, Sanders, Harris, Booker, and Klobuchar \u2014 could be trapped in Washington for President Trump\u2019s impeachment trial in the weeks leading up to Iowa, depending on how the House\u2019s inquiry shakes out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, Iowa will be the key for Buttigieg, and while the Iowa State poll suggests it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on him there, it\u2019s also too early to write off lower-polling Democrats in the caucuses. In 2012, for example, the eventual Republican winner of Iowa (Rick Santorum) was polling below 5 percent at this point in the race. In 1988, Joe Trippi recalls, the Dick Gephardt campaign, on which he was working, was \u201cdead last three weeks out [from Iowa caucus day] at 7 percent.\u201d Gephardt went on to win Iowa. With more than three months still to go until the first-in-the-nation nominating contest, Trippi says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count anyone out.\u201d", "description": "With over three months to go until the all-important Iowa caucuses, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s anti-Elizabeth Warren pivot has given his campaign new life.", "authors": ["John Mccormack", "Ilya Shapiro", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
