U.S. officials said this month they would not accept any more delays and might impose sanctions if deadlines are not met.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not rocket science that the government in Juba lacks political will to implement the peace deal,\" Machar's spokesman Puok Both Buluang said.\n\nHe called on the government to release funds it had agreed to spend on rolling out the accord. The extra six months would \"give room\" for resolving issues, he added.\n\nSouth Sudan split away from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war, then plunged into its own conflict at the end of 2013 after Kiir sacked Machar as vice president.\n\nTroops loyal to both men clashed in the capital Juba that December and ethnically charged fighting spread, shutting down oil fields, forcing a third of the country's population from their homes and killing more than 400,000 people.\n\nThe peace deal has stopped the fighting. But South Sudan's government has said it does not have the finances to fund disarmament and the integration of rebels into the army.\n\nSo far, it has allocated $10 million of the pledged $100 million, according to the international body monitoring the ceasefire.\n\nBoth sides have also disagreed on details of the deal, including the number of states South Sudan should have. Under the accord, they have agreed to hold elections after a transition period of three years.\n\nA U.N. Security Council delegation visited Juba earlier this month in an attempt to pressure the two sides to solve their remaining disputes over the pact.\n\nIt is unlikely that fighting will resume after the missed deadline, said Alan Boswell, a senior analyst with Brussels-based think-tank International Crisis Group.\n\nThis is largely because most of the international community is now urging both sides to agree on a new road map by the deadline in order to salvage the deal, he said.
