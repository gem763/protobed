I'm calling the FBI.\"\n\nThe user behind the account - AG - lives in Memphis, Tennessee, but she told the BBC the unsolicited cards had been sent to her parents' home in Nashville.\n\n\"I got a call from my mother who asked me if there was something I wanted to tell her,\" she said. \"She was really worried and it was scaring me.\"\n\nThe pair then had a video chat, and her mother asked her if she was pregnant.\n\nAG says: \"It was a really awkward situation and caused a lot of distress for the pair of us.\"\n\nAG said she had no idea how the company got her details, as she wasn't pregnant, planning to get pregnant and didn't know anyone pregnant.\n\n\"It's unsettling to me, especially as they have all these details. When I tried to call the number on the gift cards, nobody picked up so I had no idea who was behind this.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @royashariat My parents received a card addressed to me at my parent\u2019s house, with no return address, with $245 worth of gift cards and coupons, congratulating me on my pregnancy.

Those cards were then signed by a 'Jen'.\n\nThe bureau said it has given the company an F rating because of the company's failure to respond to eight complaints filed against it and because of advertising issues.\n\nWho is Jenny B?\n\nOn the Mothers Lounge website, it states both Jenny Bosco and Kaleb Pierce established the business in 2005.\n\nThe Mother's Lounge website says Jenny \"doesn't prefer the spotlight\" and instead a biography has been written by her employees describing Jenny as a mother-of five.\n\nIt states that there are many brands under the Mothers Lounge umbrella and the company began when Jenny \"invented the Milk Bands breastfeeding bracelet\".\n\nThe BBC has established that a Jeanette Court Pierce in Lehi, Utah, was the first registrant of the Milkbands domain.\n\n\"Jenny Pierce\" was also noted as an administrative contact for the Mothers Lounge site in 2012.\n\nA list profiling Ms Bosco on a 2016 blog post on the Mother's Lounge website indicates she has a twin sister.\n\nIt also says she always knew she wanted lots of children, that she is now a Utahn, but will always identify as a southern Alberta (Canada) girl.\n\nInformation on the blog post and the picture used by the company tallies with social media profiles the BBC has unearthed using Ms Bosco's married name.\n\nThe BBC approached the company to seek an interview with Jenny Bosco. We also approached the woman believed to be Jenny directly via email and the social media profiles we found.\n\nNeither request has been acknowledged.\n\nBut in an emailed statement, Scott Anderson from the company said: \"Mothers Lounge has mailed a heartfelt note which includes gift cards with proof of activation, and coupons to new mothers.\n\n\"The qualified recipients for this mailer have, at one point, subscribed to an opt-in list for maternity deals and coupons through a third-party marketing company.\n\n\"All information from third-party companies is only used internally for Mothers Lounge and is not sold or used for anything else other than the direct marketing of Mothers Lounge.\"\n\nHe did not respond to additional requests for further information.", "description": "Outcry after women receive gift cards disguised as pregnancy announcements", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11430/production/_109440707_image1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
