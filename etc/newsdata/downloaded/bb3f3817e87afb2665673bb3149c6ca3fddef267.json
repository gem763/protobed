The model is one that many are betting could be the future of medicine \u2014 but it has also been the subject of a wave of criticism.\n\nProteus CEO and cofounder Andrew Thompson pushed back against many of those concerns on Wednesday, saying that Proteus' tech is directed at making prescription drugs work better for patients. He also pointed to a new study the company was releasing as evidence that the products could help those deemed \"too risky\" by their health insurers for expensive medications.\n\n\"Drugs don't work if you don't take them,\" Thompson said, speaking with Business Insider senior healthcare reporter Emma Court on Wednesday at CB Insights' Future of Health conference.\n\nProteus' \"smart\" pills, which have sensors embedded in them, track when patients take a given drug and, with their permission, give people like doctors and caregivers access to the data. A sensor patch worn by the patient tracks that activity and records it on an app.\n\nProteus first debuted this model with the drug Abilify MyCite, which is intended for conditions like schizophrenia and, in 2018, was the first digital pill approved by the FDA.\n\nIn January, the company launched digital-oncology medicines, hoping to ensure that patients complete oral-chemotherapy cycles while oncologists gain new insights into their patients' treatment progress and overall health status.\n\nRead more: A Silicon Valley company just launched 'smart' cancer pills that track you with tiny sensors stamped into your medications\n\nSkepticism as to whether the medication sensors improve patient's taking their medication\n\nHowever, research on whether these types of pills actually help patients take their medications when they should remains unclear, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nA Proteus-sponsored study of about 100 patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes suggested that its digital pills might be an improvement on regular pills, but the results were somewhat mixed. The researchers behind the study found Proteus' digital pills led to slightly better measures of blood pressure, but rates of medication adherence \u2014 or whether or not patients took their pills when they were supposed to \u2014 were not measured as part of the study.\n\nNotably, though, an analysis in BMJ this summer said the FDA's approval of Abilify MyCite was based on weak evidence. And Abilify MyCite's label says that the technology hasn't been shown to improve patient compliance with their medications. Thompson said at the conference that was more a reflection of the difficulties of conducting studies, as the control group for the studies are difficult to maintain.\n\nProteus presents new data to combat skeptics\n\nAs a response to the criticism, during the conference, Thompson pointed to data from a new study conducted by Proteus that would be published in November. The study will be presented at a conference that month, and an abstract is available online.\n\nThe study looked at people living with hepatitis C to see if the technology could help patients take their medications and lead to the disease being cured.\n\nThe study looked at 288 patients from 18 medical centers across the US who were considered to be at risk of not taking their medicines regularly. The results from the study showed that 99.5% of the patients in the study were cured. The study didn't compare the Proteus pills with other hepatitis C treatments.\n\nThompson said the point of the study was to show that any patient, regardless of social determinants or the conditions of their environment, could be successful with drug therapy.\n\nFocus on value-based care, not cost\n\nWhether tech like Proteus' also adds costs to the US healthcare system is an open question. Abilify MyCite, for instance, costs $1,650 a month, much more than the inexpensive generic, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThompson responded to this at the conference by saying that his company's goal was to focus on value, through better health outcomes for patients rather than the cost of treating patients.\n\n\"If you don't take cheaper generics, they aren't any good,\" he said.\n\nIn the hepatitis C study, Thompson outlined the potential for high costs in the healthcare system if a patient experienced liver failure as a result of not taking their medication. Similarly, with Abilify MyCite, there are potentially severe consequences of people with schizophrenia missing doses.\n\nHe said the monthly cost of Proteus' drug technology would be less than the potentially high, long-term costs to the healthcare system if patients didn't take their medications.\n\n\"The patient learns their habits to see how they use their medicine. So does their family, so does their healthcare team. It gives the patient comfort,\" he said.", "description": "The company is behind a new product that tracks when people living with schizophrenia take their medication.
