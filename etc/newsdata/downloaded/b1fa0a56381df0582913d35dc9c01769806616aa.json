Johnson has no majority in Parliament and has failed to get his Brexit deal ratified in the House of Commons.\n\nIf he wins a majority Johnson will be able to deliver the deal he negotiated with the EU and turn the country\u2019s focus onto his domestic agenda. But there\u2019s a risk his gamble backfires and Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party capitalizes, regaining power for the first time since 2010.\n\nHow Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit Election Gamble Could Backfire\n\nOffering a taste of the Conservative Party\u2019s likely message to voters, Johnson launched into an attack on the opposition Labour leader during what\u2019s likely to be their final question session in the Commons on Wednesday before Parliament breaks up for the election.\n\nJohnson accused Corbyn of plotting to ruin what should be a \u201cglorious\u201d year in 2020 with another referendum on Brexit.\n\n\"It is time to differentiate between the politics of protest and the politics of leadership,\u201d Johnson said. He said Corbyn would deliver an \"economic catastrophe\" for Britain. \"The time for protest is over.\"\n\nJohnson outlined his priorities of delivering Brexit, as well as supporting the police service, health, the economy and \u201cwealth creators\u201d.\n\nCorbyn hit back, attacking the premier\u2019s record on the country\u2019s beloved National Health Service, accusing him of cutting funds and planning to privatize the institution by offering it up it in a future trade deal with the U.S.\n\n\u201cThis government is preparing to sell out our NHS,\u201d Corbyn said. \"Our health service is in more danger than in any other time in its glorious history because of his government, his attitude and the trade deals he wants to strike.\"\n\nLabour\u2019s campaign is expected to continue to focus on the impact of a decade of austerity to the country, while offering a second referendum on Brexit.\n\nLabour MP Jess Phillips issued a veiled attack on the Prime Minister\u2019s private life, while also criticizing his record on education, which she said has led to over-sized classes and cuts to the school week.\n\nA number of MPs asked their last questions to the prime minister, including Ken Clarke who has been a member of Parliament for 49 years and recently was expelled from the Conservative Party for blocking a no-deal Brexit.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow, who will also retire this week, paid tribute to Clarke as \u201cone of the most popular and respected politicians\u201d in the country and \u201ca great man.\u201d\n\n(Adds context and detail.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jessica Shankleman in London at jshankleman@bloomberg.net;Greg Ritchie in London at gritchie10@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Stuart Biggs\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.Boris Johnson and his arch rival Jeremy Corbyn traded attack lines in their first face-to-face clash of the U.K.\u2019s general election campaign.
