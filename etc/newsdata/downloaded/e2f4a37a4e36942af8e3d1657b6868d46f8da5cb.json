For freedom for all, in fact.\n\nAnd it came in response to Trump\u2019s tweeted criticisms that Fox \u201cisn\u2019t working for us anymore\u201d and suggesting his fans and supporters may \u201chave to start looking for a new News Outlet.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s criticisms? Well, those came in response to coverage by Fox of political issues by those who lean left, maybe even far left; those like Juan Williams, Shepard Smith and Donna Brazile.\n\nOn that last, Trump in a tweet called Fox \u201cHOPELESS & CLUELESS\u201d for her hiring.\n\nFox peeps are getting perturbed.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, Mr. President, we don\u2019t work for you,\u201d Cavuto said, The Hill reported. \u201cI don\u2019t work for you. My job is to cover you, not fawn over you or rip you. Just report on you.\u201d\n\nCavuto then listed areas of coverage he said Trump didn\u2019t like, and statements or views Trump made that he later flipped.\n\nAnd he said: \u201cFake [news] is when it\u2019s wrong Mr. President, not when it\u2019s unpleasant.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s relationship with the media has been rocky from his pre-White House days, when pundits and anchors alike \u2014 even on Fox \u2014 called out his campaign as a circus act, characterized him as a circus show.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right to say the media isn\u2019t fair to you,\u201d Cavuto said. \u201cThat they\u2019re more inclined to report the bad than anything good about you. So it is no surprise that you\u2019re frustrated that more aren\u2019t in line with you. \u2026 [But] hard as it is to fathom, Mr. President, just because you\u2019re the leader of the free world, doesn\u2019t entitle you to a free pass, just a free press.\u201d\n\nGood points.\n\nQuite right.\n\nAs Thomas Jefferson opined: \u201cThe people are the only censors of their governors.\u201d And the way they censor is through a free and vibrant press.\n\nAs Jefferson also said: \u201cThe only security of all is in a free press.\u201d\n\nExactly.\n\nTrump is great; Trump is probably the best president this country\u2019s seen since Ronald Reagan \u2014 and probably the best president this country will see for years to come. The economy is rocking, the world\u2019s governments are respectful of American once again, U.S.-Israeli relations are warmed \u2014 and most importantly, the nation, minus the leftists, is feeling a sense of optimism and hope that had gone lacking for eight long years under the previous administration.\n\nTrump, in a word, is great.\n\nBut you know what\u2019s greater?\n\nFreedom. Freedom in all of its glorious, inspiring, messy and uncomfortable forms.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
