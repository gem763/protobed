She joked that this time, she'd skipped her underwear and issued a warning to the cleaning crew that she's quite sweaty.\n\nHer speech took a turn when she then thanked both her mother and grandmother, both of whom are Holocaust survivors.\n\n\"My grandmother was in line to be shot into a pit,\" Borstein told the audience. Because she asked a guard \"what happens if I step out of line?\" and he responded \"I don't have the heart to shoot you, but somebody will\" -- and then no one did -- the actress said \"I am here and my children are here.\"\n\n\"So step out of line, ladies,\" she told the audience. \"Step out of line!\"", "description": "\"Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" actress Alex Borstein said \"step out of line, ladies\" when accepting the Emmy Award for best supporting actress in a comedy series.", "authors": ["Whitney Friedlander"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190922174238-alex-borstein-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
