The mockup of Bigelow Aerospace\u2019s flagship space habitat module, the B330, was packed with features, but I wanted to know more about how future astronaut visitors to this proposed space station would deal with the grosser parts of being human.\n\nBigelow officials were very pleased to point out that the B330 has not one, but two toilets. \u201cThe fact that there is two is very unusual because usually there\u2019s only one,\u201d Colm Kelleher, the deputy program manager for the B330\u2019s life support systems, said. \u201cAnd there have been problems when the toilet breaks down.\u201d Each of these new, state-of-the-art toilets consisted of a bucket housed inside a square tent equipped with its own suction hose, along with gloves and a mysterious bag labeled \u201cwaste.\u201d Similar tents were designated for \u201cshowering\u201d or at least scrubbing down with cloths and sanitized napkins. Various sleeping bags adorned the walls where people are meant to catch some shut-eye while strapped into their quarters. Each one sported a tiny alien logo as a nod to billionaire CEO Robert Bigelow\u2019s fascination with the search for UFOs.\n\n\u201cThere have been problems when the toilet breaks down.\u201d\n\nThe entire model was situated in one of the company\u2019s cavernous buildings in Las Vegas where Bigelow was busy pitching his expandable habitat to reporters like me. Earlier, flanked by the giant inflatable space habitat, Bigelow told reporters that he supported NASA\u2019s plan for a lunar space station. And if the massive prototype to his left wasn\u2019t a huge clue about his ambitions, he also wanted us to know that his company, Bigelow Aerospace, is eager to help build it.\n\n\u201cNumber one, we want to be part of Gateway,\u201d he told us, referring to the name of the future lunar station.\n\nThe habitat is designed to be a giant, space-faring industrial-strength balloon. It will ride into space shriveled up and compact so it can fit on top of relatively skinny rockets. Once it\u2019s free of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the B330 can expand outward, creating a cavernous room in its belly to accommodate visiting astronauts.\n\nThe B330 could sustain four people indefinitely, according to Bigelow, and it could work just about anywhere \u2014 in orbit or deep space. But one particular location is on Bigelow\u2019s mind: \u201cThe Moon is the main target at the moment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Moon is the main target at the moment.\u201d\n\nNASA is in a race against itself to get humans back to the surface of the Moon by 2024, and the Gateway is a critical part of the space agency\u2019s plans. Envisioned as a scaled-down version of the International Space Station, the Gateway will be a place for future astronauts to visit before climbing into a lander and heading down to the Moon\u2019s surface.\n\nTo meet this ambitious 2024 goal, NASA wants to build the tiniest possible Gateway with two main pieces: a small tin can where astronauts can transfer from their spacecraft to a lander, and a power module to keep the lights turned on. \u201cIt won\u2019t keep anybody alive by itself,\u201d Bigelow said of this \u201cskinny\u201d Gateway, referring to the fact that it needs life support from a visiting spacecraft. \u201cThere\u2019s not that capacity at all.\u201d But eventually, NASA wants to build out the Gateway more substantially \u2014 and that\u2019s where Bigelow could potentially come in. The agency is going to attach a much larger habitat where astronauts can work, relax, eat, and sleep. And the B330 could do the job.\n\nIn Las Vegas, one of the two mockups available for us to explore offered an open view of the interior of the B330, as if it didn\u2019t have any outer walls. Various mannequins had been positioned around the guts of the spacecraft to show where astronauts might float on a typical day in the hab. To me, the place seemed cramped, but I quickly learned that this was the equivalent of an open loft floor plan for space. Just one B330, when expanded, would provide half of the usable volume of the International Space Station.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re launching a metal can, you just don\u2019t have that volume advantage,\u201d Kelleher told me. \u201cYou have what you have at launch. With this technology, you have a multiplier of at least five \u2014 from 50 cubic meters to 330 cubic meters.\u201d (Hence the name \u201cB330.\u201d)\n\nThe B330\u2019s backbone consists of two core structures that run through the center of the cylindrical module. This hard framework is meant to provide grounding for work stations, cooking areas, 3D printers, plant growth facilities, and more that need to be in a fixed location. Each frame sported bright blue hand and foot rails, which are necessary tools for astronauts to latch onto when working in a place without gravity.\n\nwhat a bummer it would be to go to space and not get to look outside\n\nInside the other B330 mockup, we got to see what the habitat would look like from the inside. Walkways, stairs, and handrails were all there to help us earthlings get around, but in space, as their labels indicated, they would not exist. In space, people would simply float from location to location.\n\nThe B330 seemed to have it all, even proprietary shielding meant to keep astronauts relatively safe from deep space radiation and cosmic rays. (I was told more robust shielding would be needed if this was sent to Mars.) There was only one big thing missing: windows. In lieu of transparent openings, some of the walls sported curved TV screens, broadcasting the lunar surface or views from up above Earth. Bigelow informed us that while the company is looking into making windows, getting the materials right is tough, especially when your outer walls are made of soft, squishy textiles that are meant to be flexible. \u201cWindows are pass\u00e9,\u201d said Bigelow. \u201cThese TV screens make them obsolete.\u201d Still, I thought, what a bummer it would be to go to space and not get to look outside.\n\nWhile the press got a tour of Bigelow\u2019s hardware, various NASA astronauts were also checking out the goods. Having actually been to space, astronauts are probably the best people to give your space habitat a five-star review. They\u2019ve been giving feedback on things like foothold placement and the overall flow of the interior as part of NASA\u2019s NextSTEP Habitation program. \u201cThis volume is great,\u201d Michael Gernhardt, a former NASA astronaut now in charge of NASA\u2019s NextSTEP Habitation program, told reporters. \u201cBut if you lay it out bad, it can work against you. Or it can work for you. So you have great potential, but you have to lay it out right.\u201d\n\nBigelow Aerospace is one of five companies that has built space habitats on the ground as a part of the program. Bigelow and the other companies have all been receiving visits from NASA personnel to do tests of these prototypes. \u201cWhat flies will be based on the collective analysis of all these different tests,\u201d Gernhardt said. The next big milestone comes in 2020 when NASA should make a more official decision about the kind of habitat it wants. That\u2019s when things will really get going for Bigelow.\n\na B330 could be ready to ship in 42 months\n\nIf NASA were to call the company today and ask for a habitat, a B330 could be ready to ship in 42 months, which is a relatively short construction time by space standards. A second station would take 28 months, and a third station would take just a year, according to Bigelow. The team just needs to know what NASA wants.\n\nOf course, Bigelow stressed that the B330 can do more than just make the Gateway grow. It can go anywhere. A model displayed at the facility showed the B330 on the lunar surface, covered in bags of lunar soil to protect against deep space radiation. Other models showed it on the surface of Mars as well as buried inside a Martian cave. Two B330s connected together could also be a spacious transport to Mars, according to Bigelow. But, he added, testing this technology at the Moon first would be key. \u201cOnce you\u2019re away from mama and you\u2019re close to Mars, you\u2019re in trouble if you don\u2019t have a lot of backups and you don\u2019t have really highly reliable systems,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think Mars will be all in good time.\u201d\n\nThe habitat could also stay a bit closer to home. Bigelow has proposed attaching a B330 to the International Space Station, similar to what the company did with its BEAM module, a much tinier experimental habitat that launched to the ISS in 2016. An attached habitat could serve as a short-term hotel for paying customers.\n\nIn fact, the company has been very interested in sending tourists to the space station after NASA opened the ISS for commercial purposes. In June, Bigelow announced that it had bought seats on four launches of SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon capsule, a new vehicle that will soon be able to transport people to low Earth orbit. The plans were to sell tickets to tourists for $52 million each. It would be a first step toward transitioning the government-run ISS to a more commercialized station.\n\nthe company has been very interested in sending tourists to the space station\n\nHowever, those plans are no longer in the works, according to Bigelow. He noted that sending tourists to the ISS is increasingly complicated, considering the number of companies that own different assets on the station. \u201cYou have to negotiate then with 11 different legal departments,\u201d said Bigelow. So his company\u2019s plans are on pause until NASA figures out how to juggle all of those logistics and regulations. \u201cWe were this close to hiring a lot of people and setting up offices in Houston to really get with it,\u201d said Bigelow of the tourist plan. \u201cTo get into the whole advertising, entertainment, sponsorship, the whole enchilada. And so we had to put the brakes on.\u201d\n\nBigelow also noted that finding people who want to pay more than $50 million for a seat to go to space are hard to come by. Though he claims to have come up with a business case where tourists can be sent to a free-flying B330 habitat for free. Future tourists could agree to be part of a reality show contest where they compete to train and then launch to space. \u201cThis is all part of what could be a lot of fun to broadcast is the whole training regime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t going to be for sissies.\u201d In exchange, they\u2019ll get a free trip to space with the rest of the US rooting for them to make it. The idea sounds vaguely familiar to one proposed by the now-bankrupt company Mars One, which proposed funding trips to Mars with massive reality TV shows.\n\nfinding people who want to pay more than $50 million for a seat to go to space are hard to come by\n\nFor now, though, all of these ambitious ideas are just ideas. The more realistic goal is getting into lunar orbit. What we heard over and over again was the importance of having the B330 on Gateway. For the company, the government funds would be a rich payday, giving Bigelow the resources it needs to build and launch a working habitat into deep space. Then, if it works out there, more contracts could follow.\n\nWithout the Gateway program, it\u2019s unclear what the path ahead looks like for Bigelow. At one point, the CEO joked about building a chapel to pray for good news on the program. Now, it all depends on NASA\u2019s wants and if the agency has the funding to give to Bigelow and other habitat providers. But Bigelow has made its intentions very apparent. \u201cA chance to do a full 330, it\u2019ll be exciting to be part of such an ambitious endeavor,\u201d said Bigelow. \u201cIt\u2019s not just going back to the Moon. This is something much, much larger than that.\u201d\n\nPhotography by Loren Grush / The Verge", "description": "Bigelow Aerospace invited The Verge to take a tour of its flagship space habitat, the B330, an expandable module meant to serve as a home for astronauts beyond Earth.
