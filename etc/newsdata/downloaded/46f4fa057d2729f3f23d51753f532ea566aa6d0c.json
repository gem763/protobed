They are now the couple everyone is trying to get to know. Till their name was announced as prize winners, no one (apart from a select few who follow their work) knew about them. Today everyone is claiming kinship. That is what they mean when they say, \u201cSuccess has many friends and relatives\u201d.\n\nAbhijit Banerjee, 58, and Esther Duflo, 46, won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2019, along with economist Michael Kremer. Mr Banerjee and Ms Duflo are professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Ms Duflo is the second woman to be awarded a Nobel in economics and the youngest one at that. If India is celebrating her son, it is time to acknowledge the brilliant bahu.\n\nWikipedia has already been updated. It says, \u201cHer research focuses on microeconomic issues in developing countries, including household behavior, education, access to finance, health, and policy evaluation. Together with Banerjee, Dean Karlan, Kremer, John A. List, and Sendhil Mullainathan, she has been a driving force in advancing field experiments as an important methodology to discover causal relationships in economics. Together with Banerjee, she has written Good Economics for Hard Times, to be published in November 2019.\u201d\n\nI can imagine the scene at the publishing house. The commissioning agent has been declared to be clairvoyant. The editor has been given a bonus. The publisher is likely yelling at the printer, \u201cI said 200,000 copies to be printed. Not 2000 copies. You should consider yourself lucky to be printing a Nobel Laureate\u2019s book.\u201d\n\nThe field of developmental economics has long been obsessed with trying to understand poverty. Does poverty impact how we look at the world? Are their spending patterns different?\n\nBBC says, \u201cUsing an 18-country data set on the lives of the poor, the economists found that food represented 36-70% of the consumption of the extremely poor living in rural areas and 53-74% among their urban counterparts. Also that when they did spend on food, they spent in on \u201cbetter-tasting, more expensive calories\u201d than micronutrients.\u201d\n\nPoverty often leads to tunnel vision \u2013 just an unwavering attention towards money that takes away good judgment, and lessens the ability to make rational choices or see a bigger picture. I have seen people working on daily wages or in temporary gigs splurge on food on pay-days. That leaves them no money for the rest of the days. They do not save for a rainy day. And one sickness can plunge the family into a debt trap.\n\nWe now know that the new minted Nobel Laureate learned about poverty while playing football with the slum children who lived very close to his home. Playing football may have played a role in Abhijit getting the Prize, I would argue. What was even more heartening was that he was not a topper. And that he takes pride in his cooking. Maybe the latest role model may inspire parents to let their children play a little longer. Even if that does not get us more Nobel winners, it will surely improve the children understand that serendipity has a role to play in success.", "description": "Everyone will soon know every piece of trivia about Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo.
