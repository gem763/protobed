A lineup filled with savages, as Yankees manager Aaron Boone might say.\n\nA lineup that features a No. 8 hitter who can hit a grand slam that all but ended a series like former three-hole hitter Didi Gregorius did Saturday night.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe type of lineup that has pounded the Minnesota Twins into submission to grab a command 2-0 series lead after Saturday\u2019s 8-2 win in the Bronx, extending the Yankees winning streak against Minnesota to 12 games.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. I know the lineup we have and the talent we have,\u201d designated hitter Edwin Encarnacion said. \u201cI know we\u2019re going to do some damage.\u201d\n\nNew York Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius (18) reacts to hitting a grand slam against the Minnesota Twins in the third inning in game two of the 2019 ALDS playoff baseball series at Yankee Stadium. (Andy Marlin-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAvengers, assemble\n\nWith apologies to the Twins, who yet again are the Washington Generals to the Yankees\u2019 Harlem Globetrotters, we can declare this series is over. The Twins entered this series hoping this was finally their year to be Cinderella, but the clock struck midnight once the first pitch was thrown Friday.\n\nThe Yankees\u2019 hitters have simply been too much for the Twins, which has turned this ALDS into the exhibition bout before the heavyweight rematch with the Astros. The Twins and the world are seeing just how potent this Yankees lineup can be at full strength, a scary thought considering the Yankees led the majors in runs scored despite a record-setting number of injuries.\n\nNow that the regulars are healthy, it\u2019s a lineup that features an embarrassment of riches.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiancarlo Stanton, a former NL MVP, hits fifth. Gleyber Torres, masher of 38 bombs, bats sixth. Sanchez, the game\u2019s premier slugging catcher, is seventh. And Gregorius, who burned these Twins with another three-run homer in the 2017 wild-card game, is your eight hitter. Even in a down season, Gregorius isn\u2019t your typical eight hitter. There simply isn\u2019t an easy out.\n\nFriday\u2019s game actually marked the first time Boone used that combination of players after a season of having to rely on unheralded reserves like Mike Tauchman, Mike Ford and Cameron Maybin.\n\n\u201cNow we have the full lineup together, it\u2019s very exciting,\u201d Encarnacion said. \u201cEverybody in this room knows what we can do.\u201d\n\nOct 5, 2019; Bronx, NY, USA; New York Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius (middle right) celebrates after hitting a grand slam with teammates against the Minnesota Twins in the third inning in game two of the 2019 ALDS playoff baseball series at Yankee Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Andy Marlin-USA TODAY Sports\n\nPutting a seven spot on the board\n\nThe Twins are seeing first-hand what these full-strength Yankees can do, and it hasn\u2019t been pretty. Take the third inning Saturday.\n\nTwo singles and a walk loaded the bases with no outs. The Yankees had a 1-0 lead. Twins manager Rocco Baldelli went to Tyler Duffey, who posted a 2.50 ERA during the regular season. Baldelli had the pitcher he wanted for that spot, but the Yankees wouldn\u2019t go down easily, putting on a two-strike clinic.\n\nDuffey got ahead and tallied two strikes on each of the next four batters, yet each ended with a productive outcome for the Yankees. Stanton\u2019s sacrifice fly made it 2-0 before Torres singled in a run for a 3-0 lead. After Sanchez was hit by a pitch, Gregorius hit his grand slam to right field to all but end the game.\n\nGregorius stood at home, shifting his weight back and forth, while watching his bomb before rounding the bases as the sellout crowd screamed at the top of their lungs and Too $hort\u2019s \u201cBlow the Whistle\u201d blared.\n\n\u201cThat just shows you what this team can do,\u201d Gregorius said. \u201cWe\u2019re not just relying on one person. This group has always been together, top two batters doing damage. If I don\u2019t do it today or don\u2019t do it right now, there\u2019s a guy behind me that I\u2019ve got enough trust in him that he\u2019s doing to do the job anyway. It\u2019s always been like that for us.\u201d\n\nThe Twins have averaged 7.38 pitches per out in this series, highlighting just how savage the Yankees have been in the box.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the strength of this team, one through nine, it\u2019s going to get to a full count, every single time, we\u2019re going to foul off pitches, then if you\u2019re not going to pitch to us, we\u2019ll take our walks,\u201d Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge said. \u201cWe\u2019re unselfish. Everybody is next man up. That\u2019s what this makes team great. We get into that bullpen early and that helps you in a series like this \u2014 not only in that game, but next couple of games.\u201d\n\nOct 5, 2019; Bronx, NY, USA; The New York Yankees celebrate defeating the Minnesota Twins after game two of the 2019 ALDS playoff baseball series at Yankee Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Andy Marlin-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWaiting on Houston\n\nThe Twins entered this series with a team that was supposed to be different than those teams that failed in yesteryears.\n\nSure, those teams had the likes of Johan Santana, Michael Cuddyer, Joe Mauer and Torii Hunter, among others, but this team set an MLB record for homers. They were supposed to be the ones who could finally step up to the Bronx bullies.\n\nOnly, the bullying hasn\u2019t stopped with the Bomba Squad being reduced to second fiddle in this series. It\u2019s the Yankees, not the Twins, that have been the relentless offense.\n\nNow they\u2019re sending a message: The Yankees are ready for their shot at the Astros\u2019 vaunted trio. Yes, they\u2019ll be massive underdogs, but confidence goes a long way in this game. And right now, the Yankees are healthy and ready to mash \u2014just ask the Twins\u2019 pitchers.\n\n\u201cIn our meetings, we said, \u2018Everybody do your job.\u2019\u201d Judge said. \u201cEvery time you step up to the plate, it\u2019s not just up to you in the box. You got all of us in the box, everybody in the stands, having everybody behind you, it makes the job a little bit easier.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Yankees have bludgeoned the Twins thus far in the ALDS, scoring 18 runs through the first two games.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/73IThgb8.fkCfaYirEWbpw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vRqq2VtK_3mBC9lTg8ektg--~B/aD0yMTYyO3c9MzI0MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/bc644810-e7e0-11e9-bb6f-5eff67ab2b73", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
