But is the recent dip a sign that its time to buy?\n\nRide Square Stock to the Top as the World Goes Cashless More\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn July I wrote about how Square stock could be a buy on a dip. However, with recent developments, I am less confident SQ stock can continue trading at such a high premium to its payment processing peers.\n\nHow have things changed? Read on to see why it\u2019s best to avoid Square stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSentiment Turns Bearish for SQ Stock\n\nResults for the quarter ending June 30 were decent. Year-over-year adjusted revenues were up 46%. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, debt and amortization skyrocketed from $62 million in the first quarter of 2019 to $105 million in Q2 2019. The company\u2019s Cash App business continues to scale, now generating $135 million in revenue for Q2.\n\nBut investors are now writing off Square\u2019s growth potential. Adjusted revenue grew only 15% from the prior quarter. The company has built a tremendous brand with their flagship payment processing product. But in order to fuel growth, SQ needs new revenue streams to move the needle.\n\nFood ordering could have been the next frontier. The company owned DoorDash competitor Caviar. However, Square decided to throw in the towel, agreeing to sell Caviar to DoorDash for $410 million. The deal does have a silver lining, as it strengthens Square\u2019s ties to the food delivery powerhouse.\n\nSquare is losing key customers. In late August, the financial press made big hay over the loss of Danish chain Joe & The Juice. This highlights Square\u2019s troubles with international growth. With U.S. sales slowing down, global growth is necessary to justify SQ stock\u2019s current valuation.\n\nIs this making a mountain out of a molehill? Joe & The Juice was likely not material to Square\u2019s revenues, but it does strengthen the bear case for Square. Square has a weak economic moat. Competitors with the capital to scale can easily steal market share.\n\nInvestorPlace\u2019s Mark Hake discussed this Sept. 12. Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) are inching into Square\u2019s business. Square is now playing defense. SQ is even trying to enter their respective businesses. The purchase of Weebly was obviously a play to build a Shopify-esque e-commerce platform. Cash App is Square\u2019s answer to PayPal\u2019s Venmo.\n\nWith this in mind, let\u2019s see if the valuation of Square stock compensates for these risks.\n\nDespite Drop, Square Stock Remains Overvalued\n\nSlowing growth has impacted the Square stock price. But shares continue to trade at a high valuation. Square\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio is 52.5. This is almost double PayPal\u2019s forward P/E of 30.3. SQ trades at a discount to PYPL in terms of its price-to-sales ratio, but enterprise value/EBITDA is another story. Square\u2019s EV/EBITDA is 718.3. This is leaps and bounds above PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 40.3.\n\nBut will Square stock grow into its valuation? If you take PayPal\u2019s EBITDA margin (18.3%) and apply it to Square\u2019s trailing 12-month sales ($3.95 billion), EBITDA would be $722.9 million. Apply a 40.3x multiple. This gives you an enterprise value of $29.1 billion, close to the mark of Square\u2019s current EV ($24.9 billion).\n\nThere are a few caveats. With increased competition, there will be further pressure to compete on price. PayPal can easily subsidize a price war with Square. While Shopify is an equivalent size to SQ, Shopify can easily offer its e-commerce clients an in-house payment service. Growing into its valuation will not come easy.\n\nAll of this makes it tough to justify the current price of SQ stock. It would be one thing if Square was the \u201cname\u201d in its niche. But in many ways, Square is unfortunately an \u201calso-ran.\u201d", "description": "Square (NYSE:SQ) stock has fallen precipitously since my last analysis.
