Facebook/Cherish Delights and Facebook/Mum\u2019s Kitchen\n\nThe Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has suspended the licenses of two catering services following 39 cases of gastroenteritis in two separate incidents recently.\n\nThe people involved fell ill after consuming food from Mum\u2019s Kitchen and Cherish Delights on August 11 and September 2, 2019.\n\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) and SFA said in a joint media release on Wednesday (Sept 11) that three people were hospitalised. However, two of them had already been discharged and one person is in stable condition.\n\nThe kitchens of both the catering services involved are located on the same floor of the Shimei East Kitchen located in Bedok. All food handlers working for the two caterers are required by the SFA to re-attend and pass the Basic Food Hygiene Course before resuming work. This is following a retraining requirement that was passed last year, December 2018.\n\nRead Also: Following spate of food poisoning cases, Singapore introduces stiffer penalties for establishments with poor hygiene practices\n\nAccording to the National Environment Agency in a statement last year, there can be a maximum penalty of up to S$10,000 for a first time offender.
