He is also in the midst of a re-election campaign, fighting to maintain a tenuous lead in the polls as Israelis head to their second general election September 17.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Their request was rejected on Friday.\n\nA statement from the Likud party earlier in the week had called Mr Peleg\u2019s reports \u201ca false blood libel\u201d and the state witness account \u201clies\u201d.\n\nOn Friday, local media said increasing personal attacks against Mr Peleg, including by the prime minister\u2019s own son, Yair, had prompted the journalist to hire a bodyguard.\n\nIn his Facebook call to boycott Our Boys, Mr Netanyahu said he had been approached by a group of Israeli families whose loved ones were killed in Palestinians terrorist attacks who found the show objectionable.\n\nHe said they pointed out that \u201cIsrael has worked with determination to apprehend and punish Abu Khdeir\u2019s murderers. In contrast, the Palestinian Authority rewards and glorifies Jewish murderers\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince the series aired last month, many of you have contacted me and asked what could be done. I have made my recommendation clear: Do not watch Keshet or its shows,\u201d Mr Netanyahu wrote.\n\n\u201cThis is the real answer in democracy, freedom of choice to watch and freedom of choice not to watch.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate comment from HBO or Channel 12.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Washington Post, Hagai Levi, who with Cedar and Abu Wael wrote, directed and produced Our Boys, said he expected a backlash from right-wing Israelis upset an Arab victim was spotlighted over a Jewish one.\n\n\u201cFor me, I already knew about Arab terror, but the murder of Muhammad Abu Khdeir created more questions than answers. I just couldn\u2019t believe that Jews could do this, and I wanted to know why they did,\u201d said Mr Levi.\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0is calling for Israelis\u00a0to boycott one of his country\u2019s most popular television channels for producing what he has termed an \u201cantisemitic\u201d TV series.", "authors": ["Ruth Eglash"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/02/12/Benjamin-Netanyahu.jpg"}
