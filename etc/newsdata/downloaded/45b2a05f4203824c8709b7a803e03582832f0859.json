Mulvaney\u2019s role in enlisting Sondland and the others to take over relations with Ukraine was revealed Tuesday in testimony by George Kent, the State Department\u2019s Ukraine expert, according to Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who participated in the closed-door hearing before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees.\n\nMulvaney declined requests for comment. Some of his defenders have said he knew very little about the details of the trio\u2019s efforts in Ukraine and was mainly orchestrating meetings for the president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember any substantive conversation with Mick. I don\u2019t remember him approving, disapproving, getting involved, having an interest,\u201d said Rudolph W. Giuliani, who, as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, also served as the president\u2019s emissary to Ukraine. \u201cMulvaney was not a big player in this. I dealt with Volker and Sondland.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut current and former officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, said Mulvaney contributed substantially to the unfolding political crisis, both through his connection to key events related to the attempt to pressure Kiev and through his general approach to the chief of staff job, which was driven by a perceived reluctance to displease the president.\n\nU.S. officials said Mulvaney met frequently with Sondland and that details of their discussions were kept from then-National Security Adviser John Bolton and other officials who were raising internal concerns about the hidden Ukraine agenda.\n\nMulvaney also tolerated meetings between Trump and Giuliani at a time when Giuliani was brazenly declaring in interviews his intent to enlist Kiev in efforts to substantiate conspiracy theories about the 2016 election and revive seemingly dormant probes that could prove damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps most significantly, Mulvaney \u2014 at the direction of the president \u2014 placed a hold on nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine in the weeks before Trump used a July 25 phone call to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to pursue Giuliani\u2019s agenda. The impeachment probe was triggered in August by a whistleblower complaint submitted by a CIA employee to the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s inspector general; the complaint focused in part on the July 25 call.\n\nWhen some in the White House questioned the legality of blocking funds to Ukraine \u2014 funds approved by Congress to help fend off Russian attacks on its sovereignty \u2014 U.S. officials said Mulvaney told staff that he had determined that the money could be turned on and off with no legal consequence.\n\nDuring his call with Zelensky, Trump emphasized how much aid Ukraine received from the United States, noting that he didn\u2019t believe America\u2019s largesse had been reciprocated. He then asked for \u201ca favor, though,\u201d pushing Zelensky to revive an investigation of an energy company, Burisma, that had paid Biden\u2019s son Hunter to serve on its board.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump also prodded Zelensky to dig into a conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine \u2014 not Russia \u2014 that had interfered in the 2016 presidential election, and that hacked computer hardware from the Democratic National Committee had been smuggled to Ukraine to hide the evidence.\n\nSondland, Volker and Giuliani had laid the groundwork for that call over months of meetings with Ukrainian officials, texting one another the need to secure a commitment to produce what Sondland described as Trump\u2019s \u201cdeliverable.\u201d\n\nThat largely off-the-books effort could not have proceeded, current and former administration officials said, without Mulvaney facilitating meetings, halting the flow of aid and circumventing the national security bureaucracy.\n\nAD\n\nIn a measure of the internal tension and suspicion, Fiona Hill, who served as Trump\u2019s top Russia adviser until leaving the administration in August , testified this week that Bolton urged her to alert White House lawyers to troubling developments related to Ukraine. She said Bolton had vowed that he would not be \u201cpart of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nU.S. officials said the friction between Mulvaney and Bolton led to a series of ruptures, including one on the day of the July 25 phone call. The White House has launched a formal internal review of the call and the circumstances around it, according to a senior administration official. The move was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nBolton, already troubled by the administration\u2019s interactions with Ukraine, insisted that he alone handle the pre-call briefing with the president. But Sondland, who as U.S. ambassador to the European Union is based in Brussels, demanded that he also participate in the prep session.\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney backed Sondland, urging that he be allowed on the call, according to a White House official. When Bolton refused, Mulvaney appears to have again found a way to bypass the national security adviser. Bolton proceeded to brief the president solo, but then Sondland was patched through on a separate call.\n\nAD\n\nIn a July 26 interview on an English-language Ukranian television program, Sondland said he \u201cactually spoke with President Trump just a few minutes before he placed the call.\u201d\n\nSince he was thrust into the role of chief of staff early this year, officials said, Mulvaney has been more acquiescent to Trump than his predecessor, John Kelly, who sought to impose greater discipline in the White House and restrict access to the president.\n\nAD\n\nSondland \u201cwas talking to Mulvaney all the time,\u201d said a former U.S. official familiar with their interactions. When confronted by Bolton or Hill, the official said, Sondland would rebuff them, saying he felt no obligation to coordinate with them because he had direct lines to Trump and Mulvaney.\n\n\u201cMulvaney has really abdicated the most important duty of any White House chief of staff, and that\u2019s to tell the president hard truths,\u201d said Chris Whipple, author of \u201cThe Gatekeepers,\u201d a book about previous White House chiefs of staff. \u201cHe really should have thrown his body in front of that phone call with Zelensky.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne of Mulvaney\u2019s top aides, Rob Blair, listened to the Trump-Zelensky call and briefed Mulvaney afterward, a White House official said. The official said that Mulvaney began inquiring more urgently about the call only weeks later, after the whistleblower report surfaced.\n\nAD\n\nThat complaint alleged that White House officials had taken the unusual step of moving a rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call into a highly classified database typically reserved for covert intelligence programs and operations.\n\nMulvaney asked John Eisenberg, the top lawyer for the National Security Council, about the decision to move the record of the phone call. Eisenberg replied that he had instructed NSC officials to restrict access to the rough transcript but did not specifically direct them to place it on the classified server \u2014 implying they had done so of their own volition, the official said.\n\nAD\n\nA former South Carolina congressman who came to Washington as part of the 2010 tea party movement, Mulvaney was installed as acting chief of staff in January. His promotion followed the departure of an array of senior administration officials \u2014 including former defense secretary Jim Mattis \u2014 who seemed more inclined to challenge Trump\u2019s decisions, especially on foreign policy.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental issue . . . is that none of the president\u2019s top advisers agree with his view of foreign policy. None of them,\u201d said a former senior National Security Council official. \u201cNone of his principals share his views because they are so idiosyncratic.\u201d\n\nMulvaney, by contrast, didn\u2019t have strong opinions when it came to international affairs. He was more in sync with Trump, sharing the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d view that the U.S. government should be doing far less abroad and that other countries should be doing far more.\n\nUnlike Kelly, who often seemed to chafe at Trump\u2019s impulsive decisions, officials said, Mulvaney\u2019s primary goal often seemed to be pleasing the president.\n\nAaron C.
