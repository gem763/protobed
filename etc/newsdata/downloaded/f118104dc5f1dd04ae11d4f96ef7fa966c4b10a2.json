Majority Strategies sued Harris last year in an effort to recoup more than $1 million that the firm says it is still owed from its work on Harris\u2019 behalf.\n\nPrior to the lawsuit, Majority Strategies tried a more unorthodox approach. It locked Harris out of his own campaign\u2019s website and social-media accounts, and used them to attempt to shame the candidate into paying the debt. \u201cCole Harris owes his campaign vendors and employees at least $1.1 million in unpaid bills,\u201d the website blared.", "description": "Court documents describe the extraordinary lengths to which the firm was prepared to go to ensure that the former California lieutenant governor candidate ponied up the funds.", "authors": ["Lachlan Markay"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567699240/190905-markay-cole-harris-hero_vxcnr0", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
