His events were already infamous for the violence they inspired in his supporters. The Friday evening rally on the campus of University of Illinois at Chicago, one of the most diverse colleges in the country, had a powder keg feel. It turned out even more chaotic than expected, marked by angry clashes between protesters and Trump supporters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad when you can\u2019t have a rally,\u201d Trump said, after the event was scrapped.\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t been back to Chicago since \u2013 choosing instead to lob mean-spirited attacks at the city from afar and on Twitter.\n\nThat will change on Monday, when Trump is set to go face-to-face with the city he maligns as a \u201cdisaster\u201d for his first time as president. He has appearances scheduled at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference and a big-ticket campaign fundraiser at Trump International Hotel and Tower.\n\nHe has done nothing at all to help us in Chicago except demonize us, and we don\u2019t deserve it Michael Pfleger\n\nUnsurprisingly, the visit will be met with protests and snubs from some leaders, a reflection of how this diverse and left-leaning city feels about a president who has described it as \u201cout of control\u201d. It will also give the president an opportunity to seize on high-profile Chicago issues: its gun violence problem and a teachers\u2019 strike that has tested the resolve, and credibility as a reformer, of new mayor Lori Lightfoot.\n\nTrump has long loved to hold up Chicago as a model for all the things he sees wrong with Democratic policies. He\u2019s likely to do it again on Monday. Leaders and residents do not want his input.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not welcome here,\u201d said Michael Pfleger, pastor at St Sabina church on the south side and a noted anti-violence activist. \u201cHe has done nothing at all to help us in Chicago except demonize us, and we don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\n\nPfleger called on the president to either visit the south and west sides, which have endured the bulk of the city\u2019s notorious gun violence, or call off the trip entirely. That Trump continues to weigh in on the problem of gun violence in Chicago without understanding the lives and concerns of those impacted by it, Pfleger said, further underscores his inability to truly help the city.\n\n\u201cHe makes it look as though the problem with Chicago are people in Chicago,\u201d he said, \u201crather than that we all have a piece in this pie.\u201d\n\nTrump is due to begin his day at the police chief\u2019s conference, which will be boycotted by Chicago\u2019s top cop, Eddie Johnson.\n\n\u201cI will not be attending the president\u2019s speech because the values of the people of Chicago are more important than anything he would have to say,\u201d Johnson said in a statement last week.\n\nFrom there, Trump will attend a fundraising lunch at his own building, which bears his name in huge letters. The downtown tower has been the site of numerous protests since his election win in 2016. Demonstrators will gather for his latest visit.\n\nA coalition led by Indivisible Chicago and Indivisible Illinois, progressive organizations created in the wake of his victory, is planning a \u201cGet Out Of Our House\u201d rally to send a message that he\u2019s not wanted here.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re angry,\u201d Marj Halperin of Indivisible Chicago said. \u201cHe is taking pleasure in the misery of our city.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know us. He\u2019s coming to our city to raise money, largely from people who don\u2019t live in this city, without ever having addressed, supported, listened to the people who really need help.\u201d\n\nTrump has used Chicago\u2019s problem with gun violence to argue against gun control reform. He has also suggested police need to be \u201cmuch tougher\u201d if they are going to cut crime in the city.\n\nSanders nearly took Iowa in 2016. Can the radical Democrat win it in 2020? Read more\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to stop it by being nice,\u201d Trump told the Chicago Tribune in 2015. \u201cYou\u2019re going to stop it by being one tough son of a bitch.\u201d\n\nHe has also attacked Chicago and other sanctuary cities over their opposition to his draconian anti-immigration agenda.\n\n\u201cWe are \u2026 giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only,\u201d he threatened earlier this year.\n\nThis week, the teachers strike that has kept thousands of public school students out of class for more than a week and controversies surrounding Johnson could give him more ammunition.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this divisiveness he tries to feed,\u201d said Gilbert Villegas, an alderman who represents the north-west side\u2019s 36th ward and who was among local leaders who participated in the protests that cancelled the 2016 rally at UIC.\n\n\u201cThe president has just done a horrible job trying to bring this country together. He has to realize he\u2019s the president of the United States, and that Chicago, Illinois, is within those United States.\u201d", "description": "Trump is set to go face-to-face with the city he maligns as a \u201cdisaster\u201d for his first time as president", "authors": ["Eric Lutz"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/703a9c71caff9dea83e6dd51a39f652c76315c50/0_246_4272_2563/master/4272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=42cfefc880f8a8e68ad62fe5ae5a7af2", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
