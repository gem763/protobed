Later, he threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico to address concerns over border security.\n\nTrade developments have been \u201cup and down and then up, I guess\u2014or back up, perhaps\u2014over the course of this intermeeting period,\u201d Mr. Powell said Wednesday. \u201cIn any case, they\u2019ve been quite volatile.\u201d\n\nMr. Powell mentioned trade 20 times at his news conference on Wednesday. Other geopolitical risks figured less prominently or not at all. Mr. Powell mentioned Brexit once, and tensions in Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia didn\u2019t come up.\n\n\u201cThe thing we can\u2019t address, really, is what businesses would like, which is a settled road map for international trade. We can\u2019t do that. We don\u2019t have that tool,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cBut we do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness to some extent by supporting demand through sound monetary policy.\u201d\n\nMr. Powell said business contacts across the country have reported being discouraged from making new investments because of trade-related uncertainty.\n\nBusiness executives have sent Mr. Trump and his advisers a similar message, particularly after he escalated trade tariffs and threatened to bar U.S. firms from doing business in China last month.\n\nFed officials voted to cut rates Wednesday by a quarter-percentage point for the second time in as many months, though the vote on the 10-person rate-setting committee wasn\u2019t unanimous. Two dissenters favored holding rates steady, while one preferred a larger, half-point cut.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s benchmark rate is now in a range between 1.75% and 2%.\n\nIn an interview Thursday on the Fox Business Network, White House economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow said the Fed\u2019s recent move was a \u201cstep in the right direction.\u201d He added, \u201cThey probably have more work to do\u2026and I reckon they\u2019ll probably get there.\u201d\n\nMr. Kudlow brushed aside a question over whether trade-related uncertainty was harming business investment. Recent data on manufacturing activity showed improvement, he said, and he predicted a pickup in spending on business equipment.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Powell said he didn\u2019t mean to suggest the Fed\u2019s tools haven\u2019t had any effect. The Fed\u2019s pivot away from raising interest rates at the start of the year to holding them steady during the spring to cutting them this summer helped keep the economic outlook favorable, he said.\n\n\u201cWe do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness to some extent,\u201d Mr. Powell said. He added: \u201cI was pointing out that there is a piece of this that we really can\u2019t address.\u201d\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com", "description": "Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference this week carried a subtle message for President Trump: If you\u2019re worried about an economic slowdown, find a way to cool down the trade war.", "authors": ["Nick Timiraos", "Nick.Timiraos Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109040/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
