Storment, pictured with his twin sons, Oliver and Wiley and his wife Jessica. Source: LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nA father has penned an emotional essay, explaining how he found out one of his sons had died in the middle of a work conference call.\n\nJR Storment explains in the same month his twin boys were born eight years ago, he co-founded a tech start-up called Cloudability. About three months ago Cloudability was acquired - and three weeks ago, one of his sons suddenly died.\n\nMr Storment had reportedly \u201cnot taken more than a continuous week off\u201d in eight years, something he told his colleagues in the conference room minutes before his wife called with the devastating news of his son\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I have an agreement that when one of us calls, the other answers,\u201d Mr Storment explained in the essay posted to LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cSo when the phone rang I stood up and walked to the conference room door immediately.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Mum shocked after relative demans she replace \u00a31,800 blouse which her baby vomited over\n\nMr Storment said following a \u201cbig week of late bedtimes and fun daytime activities,\u201d Mr Storment\u2019s wife Jessica assumed eight-year-old Wiley was just sleeping in.\n\n\u201cJR, Wiley is dead,\u201d Jessica said when her husband answered the phone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I have to call 911,\u201d she blurted out before hanging up.\n\nBy the time a colleague had driven Mr Storment home, there was a swarm of emergency vehicles outside the house.\n\nPolice officers stopped Mr Storment from entering his son\u2019s bedroom, saying when a child suddenly dies, \u201cit becomes a potential crime scene\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was 2.5 painful hours before I could see my boy. After an hour of waiting in shock out front, I told the armed police officers guarding the doors that I couldn\u2019t wait any longer,\u201d Mr Storment said.\n\n\u201cThey allowed me to go out to the deck facing the kids room to peer through the sliding glass window. He lay in his bed, covers neatly on, looking peacefully asleep.\n\n\u201cI put my hand on the glass and lost it.\u201d\n\nAfter the medical examiner was done, the family was allowed to be with Wiley and Mr Storment said they stayed with him for about 30 minutes.\n\nEventually all the emergency vehicles left the street, the last vehicle to leave being the black mini van with Wiley\u2019s body.\n\nRelated Video: When You Face the Possibility of SUDEP\n\nWiley\u2019s big dreams\n\nMr Storment said his son was obsessed with starting a business - sometimes the family would \u201cwork for\u201d Wiley, not with him.\n\n\u201cOne day it was a smoothie stand, the next it would be a gallery, then a VR headset company, then a \u2018coder\u2019, then a spaceship building company.\u201d\n\nAt the age of five Wiley told his father he would get married as an adult and at six had already found his future wife. Moving from Portland to London, to Hawaii, the young couple kept in contact by writing letters.\n\nThe tragedy of it all came crashing home when Mr Storment read his son\u2019s death certificate.\n\n\u201cSeeing his name written on the top of it was hard,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHowever, two fields further down the form crushed me. The first said: \u2018Occupation: Never worked\u2019 and the next: \u2018Marital Status: Never married\u2019.\n\n\u201cI feel both fortunate and guilty to have had success in each.\u201d\n\nHowever since his son\u2019s death three weeks ago, Mr Storment has had time to reflect on things he wished he had done differently.\n\nJ.R. Storment shared a page from Wiley's diary, which the family found a day after they died.

However he did have Benign Rolandic Epilepsy, which is most common in males aged between eight and 13.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018benign\u2019 because it typically resolves on its own by the teenage years,\u201d Mr Storment wrote.\n\n\u201cWiley\u2019s was light: we only saw a single confirmed seizure occur. It happened about 9 months ago while we were visiting Portland from the UK.\u201d\n\nThe night before his death, Mr Storment had words with Wiley, who was getting \u201cbossy\u201d with other kids. Mr Storment expressed how he regretted having words with his son.\n\n\u201cI can still see the tears rolling down his face and the protestations of \u2018But you\u2019re not listening to me. No one listens to me\u2019.\u201d", "description": "Three weeks after his son's sudden death, a father has penned a powerful essay titled 'It\u2019s later than you think'.", "authors": ["Yahoo Style Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aM0ZfRFwRaOEWEHAFTF20w--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/0c1bac90-d1ca-11e9-b57b-b8b40993e435", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
