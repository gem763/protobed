Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Skies may cloud up some as the cold front comes through, with the chance of a stray evening shower.

Friday night lows hold up in the 60s again. Confidence: High\n\nSaturday features a steady breeze from the south-southwest, with high pressure sitting offshore. That cranks our temperatures higher once again, with highs near 90 and higher humidity. Could see an afternoon or evening shower or storm as well, followed by Saturday night lows in the 60s to near 70. Confidence: Medium\n\nSunday may trend a touch cooler and a little less humid as high pressure tries to nose its way in from the north.
