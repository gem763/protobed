Texas", "language": "en", "text": "All I can say is that if you are like me, and you remember those years when national Democratic Party leaders treated Texas like it had a near fatal case of cooties \u2014 from Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton to Hillary Clinton\u2019s attempts in 2008 and 2016 and all those off-year elections in between \u2014 tonight\u2019s debate gave me a serious case of whiplash.\n\nMy once reviled home state is suddenly finding itself embraced in a bear hug as big as, well, Texas.\n\nWhy would this be happening? Because Texas could maybe shift from the Republican column to the Democratic one, that\u2019s why. Suddenly everyone is crazy about us. Like they haven\u2019t been since, oh, 1976, when Texas went for Jimmy Carter and most residents of the state probably regret it to this day.\n\nNow I remember what it\u2019s like to be loved. Houston! Praised as the most diverse city in the nation \u2014 \u00a1Tanto Espa\u00f1ol! \u2014 even from candidates who aren\u2019t native speakers.
