Qantas had applied for both slots, while Virgin Australia applied for just the one.\n\nVirgin Australia, which is trying to raise debt to fund the full takeover of its frequent flyer program, said in an emailed statement it plans to use its allocated slot to operate a daily service between Brisbane and Haneda from March next year.\n\nThe airline plans to codeshare with ANA Holdings Inc on flights between Australia and Japan.\n\nVirgin Australia, however, did not say where the aircraft will come from. Scurrah declined previously to rule out cutting flights to Hong Kong as part of its route and fleet review.\n\nAustralia\u2019s competition regulator earlier this month had backed Virgin\u2019s application for a slot, citing competition concerns if Qantas were to get both.\n\nThe draft decision comes ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games set to begin next summer.\n\nIASC, in its draft, said the Japanese government released 100 extra aircraft arrivals and departures per day at Haneda, aimed solely at international flights.\n\nA Qantas spokesman said his airline looked forward to operating more flights to Haneda.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll confirm whether these flights will operate from Melbourne or Sydney shortly,\u201d he said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "Qantas Airways and Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd have been awarded one slot each to operate flights at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda Airport, according to a draft decision by Australia\u2019s International Air Services Commission (IASC).
