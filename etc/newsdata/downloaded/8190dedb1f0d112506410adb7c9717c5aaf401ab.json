If I were walking down the street and said something on TMZ that was a negative reflection of ESPN and Disney, I would have to pay the repercussions of that. So for players, there\u2019s no upside to them saying anything.\u201d\n\nAs for how the league has handled it, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver earlier this week said, \u201cI recognize our initial statement left people angered, confused or unclear on who we are or what the NBA stands for. Let me be more clear... The NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\u201d\n\nSome critics saw that as a cleanup effort after the league\u2019s first response, which included a league apology, a team apology, an apology from Morey, and rebukes of Morey from Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta and Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai.\n\nBut George Pyne, a former Nascar and IMG executive who now runs his own VC firm Bruin Sports Capital, says that the NBA eventually got to the right place in its stance on the issue, and should stand by it.\n\n\u201cI think that where the commissioner landed is the right approach: \u2018We\u2019re going to stand up for freedom, free speech, freedom of expression,\u2019 and if there\u2019s a business penalty that comes along with standing up for free speech, then they\u2019re going to have to live with it,\u201d Pyne said on a panel with Williams at the All Markets Summit. \u201cI think that\u2019s where it is, they have to tough it out, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much more to say if you\u2019re the NBA. Less is more, and you hope life goes on.\u201d\n\nWilliams echoed the sentiment, saying that the NBA \u201cshould remain unapologetic about where they were and how they handled the situation.\u201d\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - OCTOBER 10: (L-R) Moderator Dan Roberts, president of IMG George Pyne (L) and Jay Williams attend the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit at Union West Events on October 10, 2019 in New York City.

And there are thousands of other people who have factories and operations in China, and they do very well. But you have to respect the norms.\u201d\n\nWilliams, a former Duke basketball champion and NBA first-round draft pick, has been an ESPN analyst since 2008. Pyne, the former COO of Nascar and then president of IMG, launched Bruin Sports Capital in 2015.
