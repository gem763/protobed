During recent weeks I have had really positive discussions with the club,' he said.\n\nWilson said working closely with manager Steven Gerrard was important, adding: 'The vision and passion shared collectively by the board and by Steven in terms of the plans to continue to build the club are exciting.\n\n'Equally it was important that both the club and I shared the same understanding of what this role is and what the football model and culture inside the club needs to look like going forward.'\n\nWilson will leave Southampton on Tuesday and start work with Rangers next month.\n\nWilson says the prospect of working with Steven Gerrard convinced him to move to Ibrox\n\n'Having worked in football leadership for the last 15 years and for almost a decade in England now is a good time for me to return to Glasgow and be a part of this famous club. I am excited to start next month,' he said.\n\n'Steven and his coaching team are doing a great job with things on the pitch, along with the players of course.\n\n'I know some of the squad already and the others I will get to know quickly in the coming weeks.
