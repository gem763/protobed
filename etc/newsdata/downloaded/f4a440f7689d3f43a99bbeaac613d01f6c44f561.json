As he unwrapped the box, he became more excited than an elf on Christmas Eve upon discovering its contents.\n\nWhen your nephew asks for ketchup for Christmas, you get him ketchup for Christmas pic.twitter.com/39MctAO0sX \u2014 Morgan Deichert (@morgandeichert) December 23, 2018\n\nBy Wednesday, the video had nearly 5 million views and appeared on TODAY's \"Daly Click\" with Carson Daly.\n\n\"We all know and love the joy on kids' faces when they get exactly what they want when they ask that from Santa, and all this little boy wanted for Christmas was some condiments,\" Carson said. \"Wait 'til he discovers pigs in a blanket.\"\n\n\"Whoa. Ketchup! Ketchup! Ketchup is in here ... What's in here? Ketchup? Look at what's in there! Ketchup is in there,\" the boy said excitedly in the video.\n\nTweeters loved Sawyer's reaction.\n\nIt spread holiday joy.\n\nThis brought me so much joy! Hope he enjoys the whole bottle! \u2014 Shawna Wiggins (@LAUrbanBohemian) December 25, 2018\n\nAnd several tweeters agreed ketchup, one of the healthier condiments out there, makes everything taste better.\n\nI\u2019m with you buddy, Ketchup makes everything better, eggs, Mac n cheese, spaghetti, burgers,etc. \u2014 commonsense (@CraigDa83596947) December 26, 2018\n\nSpaghetti, though?\n\nOthers empathized with the Sawyer's obsession \u2014 but about ranch, which also has a cult following of people who buy entire kegs of it.\n\n@hamsinky me but with ranch \u2014 Paula Guiler (@PaulaGuiler) December 25, 2018\n\nDespite a unanimous love of condiments, there weren't too many mentions of mayo. Maybe because we can all agree that watching a young child's delight upon receiving ketchup is far superior than watching two girls eat mayo by the spoonful.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Deichert posted again and requested followers donate money to her Venmo account to \"buy Sawyer more ketchup.\"\n\nWhether the tweet was a joke or not has not been confirmed and Deichert has yet to respond to TODAY Food's request for comment Wednesday morning. But the follow-up post received a mix of support and backlash.\n\nSome tweeters said Deichert ruined the sweet video.\n\nAnd thought she capitalized on her nephew's cute-factor for some extra cash.\n\n\u00abMy nephew is cute, please give me money\u00bb \u2014 MKirk (@AFCMaKir) December 25, 2018\n\nOthers happily contributed to the fund.\n\nAnd offered to mail Sawyer ketchup directly.\n\nOmg I\u2019ll mail him ketchup I work in a kitchen \u2014 Christian #DepptressWalkerBiologist (@DeppWalkerJovi) December 25, 2018\n\nWe can't even imagine what Sawyer will do if he gets to open 10 packages of ketchup.", "description": "One little boy wanted a specific condiment this Christmas, and Santa Claus came through!
