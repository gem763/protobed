It contains provisions that would bankrupt gun manufacturers for the crime of selling fully functional, legal firearms. It would ban the sale of the most popular rifles in America and the standard-capacity magazines made for America\u2019s most commonly used handguns. Oh, and to incentivize a voluntary buyback of existing \u201cassault weapons,\u201d it would grant the owners of such weapons a choice: sell your rifle to the government or join a firearms registry.\n\nPut simply, Biden\u2019s plan would leave law-abiding citizens outgunned in their own homes by predatory criminals, and place virtually every gun-maker at risk of financial ruin. This is what Democratic \u201cmoderation\u201d looks like?\n\nBiden begins his plan by pledging to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, a 2005 law that was designed to shield gun-makers from liability for \u201charm solely caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm products or ammunition products by others when the product functioned as designed and intended.\u201d This is a solid basic principle. If a terrorist uses an SUV in a ramming attack or puts a bomb in a van, it\u2019s not the automaker\u2019s fault. Why should it be the gun-maker\u2019s fault if if an evil man uses a lawful product unlawfully?\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be. Yet there are all too many Americans (and American judges, especially in state courts) who view the manufacture and sale of guns as morally suspect, and of so-called assault weapons as inherently illegitimate. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act stands as a firewall against activist litigation designed to put gun companies out of business. Biden would destroy that firewall.\n\nWhat of his proposed assault-weapons ban? Let\u2019s be clear \u2014 what the Biden plan calls \u201cweapons of war\u201d are not the weapons that our soldiers carry into combat. Instead, AR-style rifles are among the most popular civilian firearms in the United States. They are extraordinarily useful for self-defense, and they\u2019re rarely used to commit crimes. (Indeed, rifles more broadly are used to kill fewer people than blunt objects or hands and feet.) Yes, they have been used in several high-profile mass killings, but there\u2019s no meaningful evidence indicating that banning them would decrease mass shootings. In fact, they\u2019ve been used in mass shootings in states that already ban them.\n\nTaken together, Biden\u2019s bans on the sales of assault weapons and the magazines that come standard with millions of popular rifles and handguns would create the perverse result of placing law-abiding Americans at a distinct disadvantage in defending themselves from criminals. With hundreds of millions of magazines already in circulation, the foreseeable threat comes from a criminal armed with just such a magazine. That\u2019s one reason why police officers carry equivalent weapons. It\u2019s one reason why bans on standard-capacity magazines tend to contain exceptions for law-enforcement officers. But if police can protect themselves from common domestic threats, why can\u2019t my family?\n\nBiden wants to give existing assault-weapon owners a choice: Sell your weapon to the government or register it with the government. But we know registration is a failed policy, one that\u2019s routinely met with massive public indifference. It\u2019s estimated that as many as 1 million New Yorkers have defied the Empire State\u2019s assault-weapon-registration law, and as many as 85 percent of Connecticut assault-weapon owners have flouted the Nutmeg State\u2019s registration requirement. A California registration requirement has had compliance rates as low as 3.6 percent. If states are the laboratories of democracy, then registration is a lab experiment that\u2019s failed.\n\nBiden\u2019s proposal also contains now-standard calls for universal background checks and his own hobby-horse, so-called smart guns that present enormous technological and practical challenges, including challenges that could hamper their use in self-defense, when innocent lives are on the line. And while I support properly drafted \u201cred flag\u201d laws, I have little confidence in the due-process protections that a Biden administration would endorse.\n\nThere are good elements to Biden\u2019s proposal. Stricter enforcement of laws prohibiting straw purchases would be a welcome way of cracking down on a method we know criminals use to obtain guns. Forwarding failed background-check requests to law enforcement could deter individuals who know they\u2019re prohibited purchasers from attempting to slip through cracks in the system. But the heart of the plan is a direct attack on the gun industry and on the inherent right to self-defense of America\u2019s law-abiding citizens.", "description": "This morning, Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden unveiled his \u201cPlan to End Our Gun Violence Epidemic,\u201d and it\u2019s a mess.
