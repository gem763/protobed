But you know it\u2019s what happens on the day.\u2019\n\nCraig then said that if you have a problem with the elimination, viewers need to work harder to save their faves.\n\n\u2018This is the first time that it\u2019s been split, this year actually,\u2019 Craig continued. \u2018In previous years it\u2019s been split a lot. Opinion is always split. You know generally when it gets down to this stage because people are very equal in talent and ability.\u2019\n\n\u2018At the moment, I think on Strictly, it\u2019s becoming obvious that there are people that are really becoming fantastic and they\u2019re leaving some of the rest behind so it\u2019s quite split in that way you know,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018But we always do get the dilemma of two really good ones being in the bottom two.\u2019\n\nMore: Strictly Come Dancing Strictly Come Dancing star Johannes Radebe says show helped him 'accept' himself Strictly's Mike Bushell defended by Kelvin Fletcher and Will Bayley after online abuse Michelle Visage reveals BTS reaction to Catherine Tyldesley's Strictly Come Dancing exit\n\n\u2018You have to remember that it\u2019s the audience at home that are putting them in the bottom two as well,\u2019 he added. \u2018It\u2019s not just the judges, we have 50% of the vote.\n\n\u2018I blame the people that aren\u2019t voting you can ask, they\u2019ll all whinge online and be abusive and then you ask them \u201cdid you vote?\u201d \u201cOh no, I didn\u2019t vote\u201d so if you\u2019re that worried about it, vote.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues Saturday at 7pm with the results show on Sunday at 7.15pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
