Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTwitter's announcement comes as Facebook, a much larger rival and dominant player in digital advertising, faces a whirlwind of controversy over its own policies concerning political ads.\n\nThe controversy began earlier this month after Facebook declined to remove an ad from President Trump Donald John TrumpNumber of uninsured children rises for second year, tops 4 million Trump moment from White House Halloween trick-or-treat event goes viral White House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report MORE's campaign attacking former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenWhite House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report Biden uses National Cat Day to fundraise for putting a 'pet back in White House' Sondland emerges as key target after Vindman testimony MORE, a top political rival, that multiple Democratic contenders noted contained ungrounded allegations.\n\nFacebook, though, says it will not fact-check political ads from public officials or candidates.\n\nThat stance has led 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, lawmakers in the House and Senate, activist groups, and even Facebook employees to accuse the social media giant of profiting from and helping to spread misinformation.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Mark Elliot ZuckerbergHillicon Valley: Amazon poised to escalate Pentagon 'war cloud' fight | FCC's move to target Huawei garners early praise | Facebook sues Israeli firm over alleged WhatsApp hack | Blue Dog Dems push election security funding Katie Pavlich: Liberals should celebrate Zuckerberg's efforts at tolerance San Francisco man launches gubernatorial candidacy to run false ads on Facebook about President Trump MORE maintained at a congressional hearing earlier this month that the platform runs political ads out of a desire to promote public discourse, but the company's decision to double down on its policies has brought more criticism.\n\nTwitter in its announcement Wednesday sought to differentiate itself publicly from Facebook, as Dorsey specifically took issue with some of the rhetoric Zuckerberg has used around \"free expression\" to justify its positions to run political ads.\n\n\"It's not credible for us to say: 'We\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad\u2026well...they can say whatever they want!'\" Dorsey wrote in a clear jab at Zuckerberg, about an hour before a Facebook earnings call.\n\nDorsey said Twitter will share its \"final policy\" by Nov. 15 and begin enforcing it by the following week.\n\nGoogle and Facebook have the largest pieces of the digital advertising market. But Twitter is an important platform for candidates and issue groups to run campaigns promoting their views. An analysis of online political advertising from New York University found that Facebook and Google each rake in tens of millions of dollars in political ad spending per year, while Twitter received $1 million between the end of 2016 and October 2018.\n\nBut Twitter's move to ban all political ads will likely allow the company to curry favor with a broad swath of Democrats who have been critical of Facebook over its controversial policies.

Technology - and social media especially - has a powerful responsibility in preserving the integrity of our elections,\" she tweeted. \"Not allowing for paid disinformation is one of the most basic, ethical decisions a company can make.\"\n\nIn his Twitter thread, Dorsey also called for \"more forward-looking political ad regulation,\" noting that it is \"very difficult to do.\"\n\nSince the 2016 presidential election, lawmakers in the House and Senate have weighed proposals and introduced legislation around online political advertising.\n\n\"This isn\u2019t about free expression,\" Dorsey wrote. \"This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address.\"\n\nUpdated at 5:20 p.m.", "description": "Twitter\u00a0will no longer run any political advertising\u00a0promoting candidates or particular hot-button issues, CEO Jack Dorsey announced Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/dorseyjack_090518gn2_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
