And I\u2019d like a break please.\"\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nShe continued: \"I know that I have a great deal about which to be grateful.\n\n\"But that little part of me that is feeling sorry for myself just wants to be seen and heard.\n\n\"She wants to jump up and down shouting 'It\u2019s not fair I want my life back I want to feel normal again'.\"\n\nLeah also struggled with losing her independence nd most of time due to hospital appointments.\n\nShe discussed what \"normal\" meant to her now: \"It means being able to make plans without first consulting the diary to see whether you are due to attend hospital appointments.\n\n\"Not wincing when others tell you of their plans for later in the year, and your mind finds itself begging the question, will I have the luxury of even being here later in the year?\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\"Simple stuff \u2013 driving, walking, breathing. It\u2019d be nice to do those with ease again.\"\n\nLeah was treated for an infection and was borderlining on having sepsis .\n\nHer condition left her with fractured bones due to weakened limbs, exacerbating her already-present back pain.\n\nDuring her final interview in August, she told the Mirror: \"I don't need to go and fulfil a bucket list, that's not my style, I just want to do the things I want to do while I am healthy and strong.\n\n\"I won't let myself live in fear, I'm just going to live a good life.\"", "description": "Leah fought cancer hard and lived far longer than doctors predicted - through several different treatments, and finally through bravely changing her attitude to death", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Leah'S Cancer Fund", "Leah Bracknell Instagram", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18992904.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/5_Leah-Bracknell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
