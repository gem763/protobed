REUTERS/Eloisa Lopez/File Photo\n\nThe Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, home to some of Asia\u2019s most organized Islamist militants, said on Monday they were braced for retaliation by Islamic State loyalists, including \u201clone wolf\u201d attacks by locals radicalized by the group\u2019s powerful online propaganda.\n\nBaghdadi killed himself in a tunnel in northwest Syria by detonating a suicide vest as U.S. forces closed in, according to U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThough his death will unsettle Islamic State, it remains capable and dangerous, said Delfin Lorenzana, defense secretary of the Philippines, where the group\u2019s influence has taken a hold among unschooled Muslim youth in its troubled Mindanao region.\n\n\u201cThis is a blow to the organization considering al-Baghdadi\u2019s stature as a leader. But this is just a momentary setback considering the depth and reach of the organization worldwide,\u201d Lorenzana said. \u201cSomebody will take his place.\u201d\n\nSoutheast Asia has long been an important focus for Islamic State, which has inspired Islamist militants in West Africa, across the Middle East and Asia and through to Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\nThe Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia are concerned Islamic State supporters from the region and those fleeing Iraq and Syria could exploit the porous borders, lawlessness and abundant arms found in Mindanao to take refuge in its far-flung villages.\n\nIslamic State has claimed responsibility for four suicide bombings since July last year in the Philippines, which fought its toughest battle since World War Two in 2017 when extremists seeking to establish an Islamic State laid siege to Marawi City and occupied it through five months of air and ground assaults.\n\nFighters from at least seven countries took part, including Malaysia, which remains on high alert and has arrested 400 people suspected of links to militant groups.\n\nMalaysian police counter-terrorism chief Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay said the real concern was not Islamic State\u2019s leadership but the effect of its teachings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good news, but his death will have little impact here as the main problem remains the spread of the Islamic State ideology,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWhat we are most worried about now are \u2018lone wolf\u2019 attacks and those who are self-radicalized through the internet. We are still seeing the spread of IS teachings online. IS publications and magazines from years ago are being reproduced and re-shared,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018JIHAD WILL NEVER STOP\u2019\n\nChatrooms in messaging applications used by Islamists such as Telegram showed defiant messages about Baghdadi\u2019s death, according to a researcher who monitors activity by Islamic State sympathizers.\n\n\u201cGod Willing, whatever happens, Islamic jihad will not rely on any one individual, but will always stand tall on the orders of God and His Prophet,\u201d read one posting under the handle Ansurul Ummah.\n\nAnother participant, Abu Abdullah Asy Syami, posted: \u201cJihad will never stop, even if our own caliph dies.\u201d\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison made a similar observation, and said Baghdadi\u2019s death was by no means the end.\n\n\u201cThis is a many-headed monster ... As you cut one off, another one inevitably arises,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nIndonesia, the world\u2019s biggest Muslim-majority country, is grappling with a resurgence in militancy and has detained hundreds of suspects this year under tightened anti-terrorism laws.\n\nAuthorities believe thousands of Indonesians draw inspiration from Islamic State and about 500 are thought to have joined the group in Syria.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s intelligence agency said it was ready for retaliation and though Baghdadi\u2019s death would be a psychological blow, Islamic State would have a successor in place.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cIt is a war. Usually, there must be a counterattack or the like. When it comes to security, we are sure that we will secure this country,\u201d said its spokesman, Wawan Purwanto.\n\nSecurity analyst Rommel Banlaoi said Baghdadi\u2019s demise and uncertainty about the leadership could undermine operations of Islamic State loyalists seeking to regroup and establish their own territory in Southeast Asia.\n\n\u201cPro-ISIS groups in the Philippines will surely re-examine their roles in the post-Baghdadi era,\u201d he said.", "description": "Southeast Asian countries fighting Islamic State's influence in the region lauded the killing of its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi but said security forces were preparing for a long battle to thwart the jihadist group's ideology.", "authors": ["Martin Petty", "Rozanna Latiff", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445782572&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0JG", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
