A recent weekend demonstration on TST\u2019s main strip, the so-called \u201cGolden Mile\u201d of Nathan Road, ended with heated scuffles between protesters and police, who fired tear gas to disperse them. Slogans like \u2018Free HK!\u2019 and \u2018Revolution!\u2019 remain daubed on walls in the area.\n\nA smattering of shoppers still pop in and out of the glitzy stores \u2014 where long lines snaking out of the front doors were, until recently, a common sight \u2014 but there is decidedly less buzz these days.\n\nWhat started as a bad year for businesses in Hong Kong, due to the damaging trade war between Washington and Beijing, has now become a terrible one. With protests entering their third month, many businesses in the culinary hub and retail mecca are in deep trouble.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He estimates that his shop\u2019s customer numbers have dropped by 60% in recent weeks. \u201cIf it stays like this, Hong Kong is dead.\u201d\n\nRead More: Then and Now: 79 Days of Protest in Hong Kong\n\nThe unrest has, at times, crippled key infrastructure, like tunnels and highways, the international airport, and the city\u2019s subway trains\u2014so much so that Hong Kong\u2019s beleaguered top official, Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, said that protests have hurt the economy more than the 2003 SARs epidemic and the 2008 financial crisis. But she has refused to acknowledge protesters\u2019 demands, which include her own resignation.\n\nTourism, which accounts for about 5% of the city\u2019s GDP and is designated one of \u201cFour Key Industries\u201d by the Hong Kong government, has taken a massive hit. A Hong Kong Tourism Board spokesperson told TIME that preliminary figures show a double-digit percentage decline in the number of visitor arrivals in the first half of August compared with the same period in 2018, and that the number of bookings in September and October has \u201cdropped significantly.\u201d\n\nThe board says that declines in tourism are due to a combination of factors, but several countries, including the U.S. and Australia, have issued travel warnings for the city and a Tripadvisor travel forum called \u2018Is HK save to travel?\u2019 has drawn almost 600 responses.\n\nTourism arrivals from mainland China, which normally account for almost 80% of Hong Kong\u2019s tourists, have been particularly hard hit, with many travelers understandably deterred by anti-Chinese attitudes in Hong Kong. During one night of protests in August, a mainland citizen that protesters suspected of being an undercover police officer, and another who is a reporter for a state-run newspaper in China, were both held hostage, assaulted, and abused for several hours.\n\n\n\nWorkers in related sectors say it\u2019s been a tough few weeks.\n\n\u201cAcross the board we\u2019ve seen a decline compared to last year, especially on Saturdays and Sundays which are the typical protest days,\u201d William, a manager for a major restaurant group in Hong Kong, told TIME. \u201cSundays have especially been hit hard \u2026 we\u2019ve seen around a 15% drop compared to last year.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s hotel occupancy rate had already dropped to 86% by the end of July, down from 91% a year earlier, and retail sales dropped 13% between July and the same month last year, according to a government press release. Sales of items like jewelry and watches declined 24.4% over the same period. Retailers are struggling so much that the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, which represents over 8,000 retail businesses, wrote a letter in August urging landlords to offer rental reductions to retail outlets.\n\nWhile tourism accounts for only a relatively small portion of the city\u2019s economy, other sectors like financial services and professional services, which make up more than 30% of the city\u2019s GDP, may also be risk if the situation deteriorates and the city\u2019s reputation is damaged further.\n\n\u201cThere has been significantly creeping concern about Hong Kong integrity as a financial center for some time,\u201d says Christopher Balding, an associate professor at Fulbright University Vietnam, who also taught business and economics for almost a decade at the HSBC Business School in Shenzhen. He says that the freedom and rule of law protesters are fighting for are directly related to Hong Kong\u2019s ability to maintain its position as a global financial hub.\n\nSome businesses are considering leaving the city altogether. \u201cA number of startups, including fintech companies, are actively exploring alternative markets, particularly Singapore, as a base for their future operations in an effort to hedge their exposure to the ongoing social unrest in the city,\u201d Benjamin Quinlan, CEO and managing partner of independent strategy consultancy Quinlan and Associates, who also sits on the board of a fintech association, tells TIME.\n\nOther companies have been caught directly in the crosshairs of the spiraling political crisis. The city\u2019s flagship airline, Cathay Pacific, saw its share price drop to its lowest point in nearly a decade as a controversy over staff involvement in protests unfolded. Several staff members were fired and the company\u2019s CEO resigned over the issues. According to local media reports, dozens of cabin crew staff from flights where mysteriously depleted or empty emergency oxygen bottles were found before take-off in recent weeks have also been temporarily suspended while the airline and authorities investigate the matter.\n\nProtesters say that corporate chaos and an economic downturn is just what they want. \u201cThe protesters are going to use the economy to force the government to reply our requests,\u201d Joseph (a pseudonym), 24, who has worked as a flight attendant for Cathay Pacific for the last two years and was among the black-clad face-masking-wearing protesters who shut the international airport down for two days in mid-August, tells TIME.\n\nHe says he\u2019s not worried about potential harm to his company\u2019s bottom line, or the economy. \u201cI always think that the freedom is much more important than the economy.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s Financial Secretary Paul Chan \u2014 who recently introduced a stimulus package for more than $2.4 billion targeting students, small and medium enterprises and low-income families \u2014 warned on August 15 that the city is on the verge of recession and job cuts.\n\nSome prominent business people agree. \u201cThe next worry is the loss of jobs because of the high rents and operational costs for businesses in Hong Kong,\u201d says Allan Zeman, a Hong Kong developer who owns property, restaurants, and bars in the fashionable Lan Kwai Fong quarter.\n\nDespite the relief measures, economists say a recession is likely. \u201cI think we are one foot in recession already,\u201d says Kevin Lai, chief economist at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong. He believes that the protests are just one reason for the downturn, and other factors like a slowdown in China, a drop in domestic consumption driven by Hong Kong\u2019s high debt burden, and an overall global slowdown are also important contributors to the city\u2019s current economic malaise.\n\nStill, the protests have worsened an already bad economic situation in Hong Kong, and some businessmen like Zeman think the protesters campaigning against Beijing\u2019s control over the city may be short-sighted. \u201cHong Kong without China is just another city without raw materials, just a service industry. It\u2019s so dependent on China.\u201d\n\nBut more demonstrations are planned for the coming weeks, and Hongkongers like Cathay Pacific flight attendant Joseph have no plans to stop fighting. He thinks that a bad economy is a price worth paying, if it means some of the protesters demands might be met.\n\n\u201cBetween freedom and a job, I will choose freedom,\u201d Joseph says. \u201cMaybe tomorrow I am not Cathay staff anymore, but I am still a Hongkonger, forever.\u201d\n\nWrite to Amy Gunia at amy.gunia@time.com.", "description": "Restaurants, hotels and retail shops are suffering from protests that gripping Hong Kong, but their workers say freedom is more important.", "authors": ["Amy Gunia", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/hong-kong-protests-business.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C3px%2C1024px%2C536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip"}
