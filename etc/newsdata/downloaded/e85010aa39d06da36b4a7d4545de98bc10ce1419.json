Mnangagwa's spokesman George Charamba did not answer calls seeking comment.\n\nMugabe's nephew and family spokesman Leo had said on Sept. 13 that the plan was for Mugabe to be buried at a mausoleum at National Heroes Acre in around 30 days.\n\nTwo relatives close to Mugabe's wife Grace later told Reuters that they were unhappy with that plan.\n\nThey even went so far as to say the family was keeping vigil over Mugabe's body because the former president had expressed fears to close family members before his death that some of the people who ousted him would seek to conduct a traditional ritual with some of his body parts. Leo Mugabe declined to comment on those stated fears and said Grace was not available for an interview.\n\nAsked for comment on the relatives' statements, ZANU-PF spokesman Simon Khaya Moyo said he had not heard anything like that and that unless the family expressed such fears publicly he could not comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe and Alexander Winning; editing by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo and Philippa Fletcher)", "description": "Zimbabwe's longtime ruler Robert Mugabe will be buried in his home district, not at a national shrine, the government said on Thursday, relenting to the family's wish for a private burial three weeks after his death.
