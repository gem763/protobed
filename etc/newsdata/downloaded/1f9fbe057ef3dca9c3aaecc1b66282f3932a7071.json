And on the second: Good. Well the league should.\n\nThe controversy started when Morey, on October 4, tweeted a photo of protesters with the caption, \u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nSeems tame. How American, right?\n\nCommunist China didn\u2019t like it.\n\nChina, which does big business with the NBA, canceled its scheduled G League exhibition games with teams tied to the Rockets and to the Mavericks; suspended all its NBA programming on its state-run CCTV; and dropped its hosting of NBA Cares events that had been set for Shanghai.\n\nThe U.S. response should have been: Bite me, China.\n\nThe NBA should have either sided with Morey or kept quiet.\n\nInstead, the NBA tweeted: \u201cWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them.\u201d\n\nHow wishy-washy.\n\nHow squishy on freedom.\n\nThen came Los Angeles Lakers LeBron James and his face-slapping weigh-in that went like this: \u201cWe do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative things that come with that, too.\u201d Translation: Hey, I\u2019ve got a $32 million contract with Nike and China\u2019s a big Nike customer \u2014 so shut up about the whole Hong Kong thing, would ya, already?\n\nGo freedom.\n\nNow comes this, from Silver \u2014 an acknowledgement that not only were NBA\u2019s communist money men dropping American basketball gigs left and right. But they were also calling for punishment of Morey.\n\nThey were also demanding his firing.\n\n\u201cWe were being asked to fire him, by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with in government and business,\u201d Silver said, at the TIME 100 Health Summit, Sports Illustrated reported. \u201cWe said there\u2019s no chance that\u2019s happening. There\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u201d\n\nAt least the NBA\u2019s taking a clear stand against Communist strong-arming on that one. Too bad it didn\u2019t come on the first issue \u2014 the simple pro-freedom tweet.\n\nMaybe then, the NBA wouldn\u2019t be losing money.\n\n\u201cThe losses have already been substantial,\u201d Silver said, speaking of the financial fallout from China\u2019s anger at Morey\u2019s tweet. \u201cOur games are not back on the air in China as we speak, and we\u2019ll see what happens next. \u2026 The financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s as it should be.\n\nAn NBA that sides with China\u2019s government over America \u2014 over the cause of freedom, over the campaign of human rights \u2014 has no business making money in America.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
