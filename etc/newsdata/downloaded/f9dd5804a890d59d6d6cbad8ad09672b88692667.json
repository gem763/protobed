The company said it is working with its customers to minimize the impact on their operations.\n\nRolls-Royce said faster deterioration of the high pressure turbine blade on the Trent 1000 TEN has remained a challenge. The company said it has decided to accelerate blade replacements for some engines yet to be fitted with the final standard of intermediate pressure turbine blade, which has led to additional engine removals.", "description": "The British aircraft-engine maker said it now expects to return to a single-digit level of aircraft-on-ground events on the Trent 1000 to be delayed until...", "authors": ["Adria Calatayud"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
