I've stopped performing because of my Parkinson's Disease. I might perform at some other point, but I have no plans to.'\n\nConnolly first revealed he was being treated for the early stages of Parkinson's', a degenerative neurological condition, in 2013.\n\nDetailling his current symptoms he said: 'I've started to drool. That's a new one for me.\n\n'This disease, it gives you a new thing to deal with every now and again.\n\n'I walk unsteady. My hearing is going. It's bizarre that bits of me are falling off - but it's interesting.'\n\nConnolly, who lives in Florida with his wife Pamela, that a US doctor told him Parkinson's is 'incurable'.\n\nWhat is Parkinson's Disease? Parkinson\u2019s disease affects one in 500 people, and around 127,000 people in the UK live with the condition. Figures also suggest one million Americans also suffer. It causes muscle stiffness, slowness of movement, tremors, sleep disturbance, chronic fatigue, an impaired quality of life and can lead to severe disability. It is a progressive neurological condition that destroys cells in the part of the brain that controls movement. Sufferers are known to have diminished supplies of dopamine because nerve cells that make it have died. There is currently no cure and no way of stopping the progression of the disease, but hundreds of scientific trials are underway to try and change that.

A doctor in America told me it's incurable and I said, 'get a grip on yourself, say we've yet to find a cure', give a man a light at the end of the tunnel. Incurable is such an awful thing to say to somebody.'\n\nThe 76-year-old said he will fly his children and the rest of his family to his Florida home for Christmas.\n\nBut he didn't want to answer what his hopes are for the next five to 10 years.\n\nHe said: 'People are good to me. My wife is good to me. She makes me my breakfast in the morning and she does my pillows at night. Life is good.'\n\nConnolly appeared on the show following the release of his new book, Tall Tales and Wee Stories.\n\nAsked whether he is 'saying goodbye' in the book, he replied: 'The performer is saying goodbye in the book.\n\n'I'm here for the duration.'\n\nAfter he failed to rule out ever performing again, he was asked under what circumstances he would change his mind.\n\nHe replied: 'The circumstances will make themselves known. Someone will ask me to do something and I'll say yes.\n\n'I almost did a gig for Parkinson's Disease at the Albert Hall.\n\n'I said yes then I changed my mind. I thought it over and the thinking about it was different to the way I thought about gigs before.\n\n'I don't think the way I used to. I feel good about that decision.'", "description": "Glasgow-born comic Billy Connolly, 76, told Chris Evans this morning that he took the decision to stop doing stand-up because he 'doesn't think like he used to'.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/09/19826898-0-image-a-15_1571301388473.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
