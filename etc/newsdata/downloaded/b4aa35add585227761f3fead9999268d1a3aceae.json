In June, police arrested then released investigative reporter Ivan Golunov in a drug case that quickly collapsed under public scrutiny.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A woman holds a poster saying \u2018Freedom for Pavel Ustinov\u2019 at a protest near the Russian presidential administration building in Moscow this week. Photograph: Maxim Shipenkov/EPA\n\nThe series of reversals in Russia\u2019s justice system has given activists momentum and created a near-formula for the release of political prisoners, with protests and online memes carrying over from one case to the next.\n\n\u201cJournalists defended Golunov, rappers defended Husky,\u201d said Alexander Molochnikov, an actor and director at the popular MKhT theatre. Husky, a popular rapper, was arrested at a concert earlier this year. \u201cLet\u2019s not stay silent at our curtain calls today, tomorrow, and in the coming days.\u201d\n\nThe backlash against the case came largely from Moscow\u2019s theatre community, which carries plenty of social capital with government elites who seek to co-opt and befriend popular actors and directors. Vladislav Surkov, a former presidential administration official responsible for domestic politics, is a noted theatre fanatic who had his own play staged by Kirill Serebrennikov, the country\u2019s premier avant-garde theatre director, in 2011.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dmitry Peskov and ice dancer Tatiana Navka attending the premiere of Kirill Serebrennikov\u2019s Nureyev ballet at the Bolshoi theatre in December 2017.

Because live theatre is seen as an elite pastime, there is more freedom to express dissent on stage than in film or on television. But even avant-garde theatres rely on money doled out by the Kremlin, which keeps its own stable of loyal actors and directors.\n\nAs tensions grew over the Ustinov case this month, some actors called for their colleagues to further cut themselves off from the state\u2019s largesse.\n\n\u201cI recommend not cooperating with film companies, with producers, with directors who suggest to you openly propagandist projects,\u201d said Nikita Kukushkin, an outspoken actor who performs at Gogol Centre. \u201cNot to perform in those plays or put on shows in theatres where space is given to those who express their loyalty to the government. Because we, with our talents and our energy, are feeding this system.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t work with the presidential administration,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ksenia Sobchak and theatre director Konstantin Bogomolov provided the celebrity wedding of the summer, attended by political figures. Photograph: Vyacheslav Prokofyev/TASS\n\nThe state\u2019s treatment of avant-garde theatre can seem wildly inconsistent. Serebrennikov missed the premiere of his controversial ballet about the gay ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev at the Bolshoi theatre because he was under house arrest. But it was well-attended by the elite set, including powerful oligarchs and Vladimir Putin\u2019s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov.\n\nAnd both Peskov and Surkov attended the celebrity wedding of the summer, when socialite and politician Ksenia Sobchak married Konstantin Bogomolov, a provocative theatre director who has increasingly supported the government and the Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin. Both bride and groom called for Ustinov\u2019s release days after the ceremony.", "description": "Ustinov is accused of injuring a police officer when he was arrested at a protest", "authors": ["Andrew Roth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/076da9a2a97fe47b9134021e05be4584adaaaea1/0_154_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=60e55f5b9676400726c22b884a3c17cf", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
