The Bidens deny wrongdoing but it remains to be seen whether Trump's charge is true.\n\nIn response, Don Jr. took to Twitter to declare Cooper was 'the DNC's MVP so far for the night covering for #QuidProJoe even when Hunter Biden said they talked about it. Would be nice if they called out the BS once in a while.'\n\nJoe Biden responded to Cooper: 'Look, my son did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine and that's what we should be focusing on ... Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven the fact that they are flat lying.'\n\nAnderson Cooper (left) prefaced a question to Joe Biden (right) during last night's Democrat debate, by saying that there was 'no evidence of wrongdoing' by either Joe or Hunter Biden\n\nIn response, the president's son Don Jr., took to Twitter to declare Cooper was 'the DNC's MVP so far for the night covering for #QuidProJoe even when Hunter Biden said they talked about it. Would be nice if they called out the BS once in a while.'\n\nThe president's claims against the Bidens are at the center of an impeachment inquiry after Trump asked the Ukrainian president to look into his political rival in a July 25 phone call.\n\nHunter Biden told Good Morning America yesterday he never spoke with his father about his business dealings with Burisma Holdings.\n\n'There is no but to this, no, we never did,' Hunter told ABC News, claiming he didn't discuss his business dealings with his father.\n\nAsked why, Hunter replied: 'Because my dad was the vice president of the United States. There's nothing as a young man or full grown adult that my father in some way hasn't had influence over as it does not serve either one of us.'\n\nHe said he did not regret his work with Burisma, where he stepped down from the board in April.\n\n'Did I do anything improper? No, and not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever. I joined a board, I served honorably. I focused on corporate governance. I didn't have any discussions with my father before or after I joined the board as it related to it, other than that brief exchange that we had,' he said.\n\nAsked why he left the board, Hunter said his work had become a 'distraction.'\n\nHunter Biden, who had no previous experience in the energy industry, defended being appointed to the board of a gas company, where reports had him being paid $50,000 a month.\n\nThe anger of Don Jr. last night at CNN's Cooper comes as a whistleblower yesterday claimed the network is driven by a die-hard bias against Trump and employees who support the president are 'not welcome' there.\n\nHunter Biden said he exercised poor judgement but did nothing wrong in his business dealings\n\nPresident Trump weighed in on Hunter Biden's interview\n\nCary Poarch gave an interview to Project Veritas along with secretly recorded video tapes from inside CNN's Washington bureau which he says proves his claim that the company, and its president Jeff Zucker, are 'obsessed' with bringing the president down.\n\nIn response, Trump said the alleged whistleblower's claims could constitute a lawsuit.\n\nOn Monday evening he wrote on Twitter: 'Project Veritas-Obtained Undercover Videos Highlight Jeff Zucker's (@CNN) Campaign To Destroy Trump. Videos Reveal @CNN's BIAS!' @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Does this sound like a good, or even great, lawsuit?'\n\nOn Tuesday, Project Veritas shared its second video of Poarch.\n\nIt was less explosive than the first, but included his claim that anyone who supports Trump or is even conservative-leaning is not welcome there.\n\n'It's an unwritten rule that if you are center, center right, or heaven forbid, full right Republican Trump supporter, then you are not welcome at CNN,' he said.\n\nHe went on to say that he joined the company as a Democrat and that he was excited to work there but that he has been left devastated by its politically geared handling of the news.\n\nThe satellite uplink technician had worked at CNN for two years turned whistleblower to accuse the network of operating on a deeply-embedded bias against Trump which is led by its Jeff Zucker.\n\nPoarch gave an interview to Project Veritas along with secretly recorded video tapes.\n\nCary Poarch, the CNN whistleblower, gave in his second part of the interview with Project Veritas on Tuesday\n\nIn the early hours of Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted that he was ready to sue CNN over the whistleblower's claims\n\nInsiders at CNN say its president Jeff Zucker has a 'personal vendetta' against Trump\n\nAmong the 'evidence' that he presented are recordings of Zucker's 9am rundown calls with senior producers and editors where he is heard ordering them to focus on impeachment stories above other political ones.\n\nPoarch also recorded multiple media coordinators who described frustration at having to follow Zucker's commands.\n\nOne said that people at the network 'hated' having to almost exclusively write about Trump but that they had to follow the boss's orders.\n\nThe secretly recorded tapes are all of media coordinators or floor planners. None of the network's journalists are filmed.\n\nCNN has not yet responded to his claims.\n\n", "description": "The anchor prefaced a question to Biden during last night's Democrat debate in Ohio, by saying that there was 'no evidence of wrongdoing' by either Joe or Hunter Biden.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/08/19776938-0-image-a-2_1571212690845.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
