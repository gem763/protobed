The Norwegian who is the favourite won the first four stages.\n\nThere was a surprise as the cars battled it out to the finishing line with Russian Anton Grigorov bagging his first stage win ahead of Andrey Cherednikov.\n\nBut the main winner of the day was arguably Jacky Loomans who came home third. He saw his two main rivals hit by mechanical problems so his place at the top of the overall standings was strengthened.\n\nSergey Kyprianov led the trucks home across the arid terrain for a second victory in this years race. He was just an hour and fifty four minutes behind Grigorov.\n\nThe gas powered Kamaz beat the Portuguese Elisabete Jacinto with Anton Shibalov making up the podium.", "description": "Austrian Robert Theuretzbacher sealed victory in stage five of the Africa Eco Race.
