one of whom sank her teeth into her arm before the other girl poured a can of fuel over her.\n\nOn another occasion, a woman's dismembered body was found hidden and her 10-year-old son had been sent to the camp's orphanage.\n\nFemale ISIS members at the camp have also turned one of their tents into a court administering the group's harsh interpretation of Islamic law.\n\nLast month, a 16-year-old girl was found guilty of apostasy and then stabbed repeatedly with knives.\n\nKurdish guards evacuated her to a clinic where she later died, according to the commander of a Kurdish police force.\n\nEarlier this month police stormed a tent and rescued two women who had been sentenced to die and were about to be stabbed to death.\n\nISIS supporters had fought back with knives and pistols when the Kurdish guards stormed in.\n\nUnder guard: Kurdish police accompany women at the camp in northern Syria last week\n\n'Foreign women are trying to impose religious classes on all women in the camp,' the commander said.\n\nThe camp is also reliant on international aid, and food is sometimes scarce and the water used for drinking and cleaning is contaminated.\n\nIt is home to some 71,400 people, mostly wives, widows and children of IS fighters, it is believed.\n\nMost of the detainees at al-Hol are Syrian and Iraqi women and children.\n\nSeparate detention camps in Syria are believed to be holding more than 10,000 militants, including some 2,000 foreign fighters.\n\nIslamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who remains at large, called on his supporters last month to attack the camps and set the detainees free.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) previously warned they would not be able to spare the forces to guard al-Hol once Turkey invaded.\n\nTrump's critics have voiced fears of an ISIS breakout and revival ever since the President ordered U.S. forces out of Syria earlier this month.\n\nThe camp (pictured) is home to some 71,400 people, mostly wives, widows and children of IS fighters, it is believed\n\nA top U.S. State Department official told Congress yesterday that more than 100 ISIS prisoners have escaped in Syria in the chaos since Turkey's invasion.\n\nJames Jeffrey, Washington's special envoy for Syria, said the number is 'now over 100' and said: 'We do not know where they are'.\n\nHis claims undermined Donald Trump's assertion yesterday that captured ISIS prisoners had been 'secured' under a deal between Russia and Turkey.\n\nHowever, Trump quickly insisted that some of the escaped prisoners had already been recaptured.\n\nTrump said he expects Turkey to 'abide by its commitment' to act as a 'back-up to the Kurds.'\n\n'Should something happen, Turkey is there to grab them,' he said.\n\nThe U.S. has indicated that some of its withdrawn troops may stay in western Iraq to continue the fight against ISIS.\n\nMore than 100 ISIS prisoners have escaped in Syria in the chaos since Turkey's invasion, top U.S. State Department official James Jeffrey (pictured) said today\n\nBut Iraq appeared to throw those plans into disarray this week by saying the Americans had no permission to stay there.\n\nYesterday the Iraqi PM confirmed that position, saying Baghdad was taking 'all international legal measures'.\n\nThe Pentagon is now considering keeping a small U.S. force in north-eastern Syria to protect oilfields and Trump indicated today that a few troops would remain there.\n\n'We have secured the oil and, therefore, a small number of US troops will remain in the area where they have the oil,' the President said.\n\nThe United States currently has 5,200 troops posted in Iraq, deployed as part of a Washington-led coalition against the ISIS jihadists.\n\nThe U.S. presence at several bases across Iraq is already controversial, with numerous political groups and pro-Iran Shiite armed groups demanding their expulsion.", "description": "The Kurdish forces who were guarding the al-Hol camp (pictured) have been distracted by the Turkish offensive and hundreds of guards have been pulled away.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/17/20142468-0-image-a-15_1571934187260.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
