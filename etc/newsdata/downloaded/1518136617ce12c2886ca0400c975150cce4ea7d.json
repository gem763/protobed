Yet with no way to measure sales or verify how many people even see the ads, the companies that paved the way for the influencer economy\u2014mostly early adopters like Ipsy\u2014are questioning if it\u2019s worth it.\n\nWhat began as friends and family sharing their favorite products has become a lucrative advertising industry of celebrity endorsers, influencers and meme creators. Such paid endorsements, known as sponsored content, are the online equivalent of a 30-second TV spot. Big-name stars can command $100,000 or more for a single YouTube video or Instagram photo.", "description": "", "authors": ["Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
