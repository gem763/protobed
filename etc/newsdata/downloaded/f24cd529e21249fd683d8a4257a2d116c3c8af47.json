Qantas sets record for ultralong trip.", "language": "en", "text": "A Qantas airplane took off from New York on Friday night and didn\u2019t stop until it reached Sydney just over 19 hours later, setting a record for the world\u2019s longest nonstop commercial passenger flight.\n\nMonths of planning went into the Boeing 787-9\u2032s 10,066-mile journey. Tests assessed the health and well-being of the 49 passengers and crew members aboard the flight, which was conducted for research purposes as the largest airline in Australia explores offering the \u201cultra long\u201d flights.\n\n\u201cThis is a really significant first for aviation,\u201d Qantas Group chief executive Alan Joyce said in a news release. \u201cHopefully, it\u2019s a preview of a regular service that will speed up how people travel from one side of the globe to the other.\u201d\n\nThe company is seeking to launch nonstop flights between Australia\u2019s east coast and New York and London, saving passengers up to four hours in travel time. Its Project Sunrise plans to test the London-to-Sydney route in November and decide by the end of this year whether to offer the new routes.\n\n[Qantas is testing the new world\u2019s longest flight: 19 hours in the air]\n\nFor the New York-to-Sydney test, the passenger and baggage load was restricted to control the weight on the plane. Medical researchers and scientists worked with Qantas to make adjustments to cabin lighting, and in-flight meals were adjusted to reduce jet lag.\n\nRather than starting with dinner and then lights off, as night flights typically operate, the research flight began with lunch and the lights were kept on for six hours to mirror the destination\u2019s time of day.\n\n\n\nThe record-setting flight lands in Sydney.

Sean Golding, who led the four pilots operating the service. They were happy with the trip, he said.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of interest from air traffic controllers as we crossed through different airspace because of the uniqueness of this flight,\u201d Golding said. \u201cWe also had a special sign-off and welcome home from the control towers in New York and Sydney, which you don\u2019t get every day.\"\n\nThe longest nonstop commercial flight that is offered is Singapore Airlines\u2019s 18-hour-and-45-minute route from Singapore to Newark, which debuted last year. The route uses an Airbus plane designed for ultralong-range travel, with features such as larger windows, higher ceilings and an extra-wide body.\n\nRead more:\n\nCruise company bans passenger for life after she \u2018recklessly\u2019 stands on railing for a photo\n\nSouthwest\u2019s plan to conquer the airline industry, one joke at a time\n\nDays after opening its first U.K. restaurant, Chick-fil-A announces the location will close", "description": "Forty-nine passengers and crew members were on board for the Boeing 787-9\u2032s 10,066-mile journey.", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter", "October At Am", "Brittany Shammas Is A General Assignment Reporter For The Washington Post.
