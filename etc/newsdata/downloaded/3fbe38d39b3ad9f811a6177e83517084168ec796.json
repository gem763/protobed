The company calls it a \u201cvirtual reality floor mat activity region\u201d in the patent application it filed to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office this week.\n\nBut any old carpet could visually block off where you\u2019re going to be throwing yourself around willy nilly. This patent, first spotted by Variety, describes something a bit more complicated.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s mat would potentially house a bevy of tech capable of influencing your VR experience while also keeping you safe from the dangers posed by surrounding furniture. Built-in \u201cfiducial markers\u201d and \u201cspatially distributed pressure sensors\u201d would communicate with the VR console to pinpoint your physical location on the mat, data that could then be used to help shape the virtual world around you.\n\nThe patent also mentions the possibility of putting \u201cvibration devices\u201d in the mat to make it, well, vibrate. Which I suppose would make for some kind of 4-D experience when paired to whatever is happening on the headset. Microsoft\u2019s patent goes on to list multiple configurations of possible VR mats, including one that would allow for some kind of customisation options so you can personalise your play space.\n\nMost interesting, though, is the shout-out to Microsoft\u2019s defunct Kinect, a peripheral motion sensor used to play certain games on its Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles. Like the PlayStation Move, it was basically the company\u2019s attempt to get in on the lucrative motion-controlled gaming market that Nintendo\u2019s Wii was dominating at the time.\n\nOne of the images included in the patent shows the proposed virtual reality mat in a living room, and the spitting-image of a Kinect is clearly visible on top of the TV. Microsoft also directly mentions the mat\u2019s potential to be used for gaming later in the patent:\n\n\u201cIn some examples, [the] computing device may take the form of a gaming console, and [the] HMD device and peripheral control devices may be peripheral to the gaming console.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, though, the patent mentions a lot of possible VR computing devices, including \u201cpersonal computers, server computers, tablet computers, home-entertainment computers, network computing devices...\u201d and so on. It even throws smartphones and wearable devices out there, so Microsoft may have simply been casting a precautionarily wide net.\n\nReleased in 2010, the Kinect never quite caught on with gamers the way Microsoft had hoped (a.k.a. like the Wii) and so the company discontinued it in 2017. Surprisingly, though, it eventually developed such a dedicated following among developers and hackers that Microsoft announced its return last May, except this new iteration sports a better camera and Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based AI technology. Maybe the company was playing a long game with the Kinect\u2019s comeback.
