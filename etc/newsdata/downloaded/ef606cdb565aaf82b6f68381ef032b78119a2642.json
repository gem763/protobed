I didn\u2019t see as many pitches as I would like to but when I did see my pitch, I tried not to miss it.\u201d\n\nPlaying left field for the first time this season with lefty Matt Joyce in right against Scherzer, Markakis also made a sliding catch to take a hit away from Victor Robles.\n\nBraves first baseman Freddie Freeman was lifted for precautionary reasons in the fourth inning with right elbow soreness after aggravating a bone spur while diving for a ground ball.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had it. I\u2019ve felt it. I\u2019ve played through it,\u201d Freeman said of the spur. \u201cJust today it was kind of a little bit more than I expected. Now it\u2019s calmed completely down so I\u2019m hoping that I\u2019ll wake up and be able to play tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAfter giving up four runs on seven hits while losing to the Nationals and Scherzer Sunday in Atlanta, Soroka (12-4) bounced back.\n\n\u201cAnytime you get a chance for a rematch after an outing didn\u2019t go your way the first time, I think you have a little more incentive and a little more giddy-up the second time around,\u201d Soroka said.\n\nSoroka, who struck out four and walked three, didn\u2019t allow a hit until Adam Eaton\u2019s leadoff double in the fourth.\n\nScherzer (10-6) gave up three runs on seven hits in five innings. Since returning from a trip to the injured list with a mid-back strain, he\u2019s 1-1 with a 3.91 ERA in five starts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s new but there\u2019s no excuses in this league,\u201d Scherzer said of working his way back. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to post, and you\u2019ve got to go out there with everything you\u2019ve got and you\u2019ve got to execute. Everything\u2019s on the line every single time you take the mound, so this is Major League baseball.\u201d\n\nAtlanta has won 10 of its past 14 games against Washington, which leads the NL wild card race.\n\nWashington\u2019s Juan Soto had a double and walked twice. Anthony Rendon went 0 for 4, ending his 27-game on-base streak.\n\nMarkakis doubled with one out in the fourth. Joyce singled him home and later scored on Dansby Swanson\u2019s double.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing with not really any at-bats - he had one little simulation game - he goes out there and hits missiles all over the yard,\u201d Freeman said of Markakis.\n\nWith one out in the fifth, Markakis flied to the warning track, scoring Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr.\n\nAlbies led off the seventh with his 23rd homer.\n\nBYE-BYE BOGAR\n\nNationals first-base coach Tim Bogar was ejected for arguing a check swing call on Howie Kendrick in the eighth inning. \u201cYou usually don\u2019t see that from Tim,\u201d manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cHe just got a little irritated. He didn\u2019t think (Kendrick) swung, (first base umpire) Tim (Timmons) said he did. More so, Tim\u2019s trying to keep Howie in the game, because Howie said something, so he defended him.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBraves: INF John Camargo was placed on the 10-day injured list with a right shin fracture. Manager Brian Snitker said Camargo could return before the season ends.\n\nNationals: C Kurt Suzuki (right elbow inflammation) may start swinging a bat by the end of the weekend, Martinez said. \u2026 1B Matt Adams, who left Thursday\u2019s game at Minnesota after hurting his left triceps, was being evaluated by team doctors.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBraves: RHP Mike Foltynewicz (6-5, 5.00 ERA) allowed eight runs on eight hits over four innings in a no-decision June 22 at Washington.\n\nNationals: RHP Austin Voth (1-1, 4.00) is 0-1 with a 3.60 ERA, 13 strikeouts and two walks in two starts against Atlanta this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nick Markakis didn't show any rust in his return from the injured list.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Harvey Valentine"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/braves_nationals_baseball_29128_c0-131-3146-1965_s1770x1032.jpg?77ba01d857e06c431f74630e74bb7e4a30ed60a2", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
