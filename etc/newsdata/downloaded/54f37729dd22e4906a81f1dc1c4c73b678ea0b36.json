It expects Hyundai to launch level 4, or fully autonomous, cars for fleet customers in 2024 and for the general public by 2027, an industry ministry official told Reuters.\n\nBut some experts question whether targets set by the government and the automotive group, which also includes Kia Motors Corp, are realistic given the technological and cost challenges and the lack of home-grown technology.\n\nIn a 45-page report on future automotive technology, the government acknowledged South Korea lags in some key areas necessary for self-driving cars such artificial intelligence, sensors and logic chips.\n\n\"Hyundai has to buy technology from someone else because it lacks software technology. Even though it has a lot of cash, this could become a financial burden if its earnings deteriorate,\" Esther Yim, an analyst at Samsung Securities, said.\n\nOther analysts noted that the prospects for self-driving cars are quite murky.\n\nGeneral Motors Co\u00b4s self-driving unit, Cruise, said in July it was delaying the commercial deployment of cars past its target of 2019 as tech firms and automakers acknowledge it will take more time and money than they had expected to make autonomous vehicles safe for unrestricted use on public roads.\n\nSouth Korea's government said it would prepare a regulatory and legal framework for autonomous cars and the safety questions they pose by 2024.\n\nIt is also aiming to lay the technological and legal groundwork for demonstrations of flying cars by 2025. Hyundai Motor's executive vice chairman Euisun Chung said last month that the company is looking at developing flying cars.\n\nHyundai has also received much government backing for hydrogen fuel cell cars, with Moon calling hydrogen power the \"future bread and butter\" of Asia's No. 4 economy and declaring himself an ambassador for the technology.\n\n($1 = 1,185.6500 won) (Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Edwina Gibbs)", "description": "By Hyunjoo JinSEOUL, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Group said it plans  to invest 41 trillion won ($35 billion) in mobility and other  auto technologies...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
