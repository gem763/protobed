Barbie debuts judge dolls, partners with GoFundMe to close 'dream gap'", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Mattel has unveiled two new Barbie dolls inspired by historic female figures. GeoBeats\n\nIt's around age 5 that girls start to doubt their intelligence. And boys don't.\n\nThis phenomenon, referred to as the \"dream gap,\" was proven by researchers at New York University, the University of Illinois and Princeton University.\n\nThey found that stereotypes associate a high-level of intellectual ability with men more than women. Thus, when young girls are exposed to these stereotypes, they don't always pursue careers that require intelligence.\n\nThis begins at prepubescence. Girls begin to avoid those brain-stimulating activities and boys move on, creating a gap.\n\nBarbie, the 60-year-old doll brand made by Mattel, is trying to change that.\n\n'Only 33% of sitting U.S. state judges are female'\n\n\"Barbie has had over 200 careers,\" global head of Barbie Lisa McKnight told USA TODAY. \"We like to say, 'There isn\u2019t a plastic ceiling that Barbie hasn\u2019t broken.' \"\n\nStill, every year, Barbie highlights a new career, especially one that is lacking female representation.\n\nThis year is Judge Barbie.\n\nThe Barbie Career of the Year doll is a judge to inspire more girls to explore judicial careers. (Photo: Barbie)\n\n\"We learned that only 33% of sitting U.S. state judges are female,\" McKnight said on Barbie's decision to introduce the judge dolls.\n\nThere are four dolls to choose from in a range of of skin tones and hairstyles and all of them wear the customary black robe and come with a gavel. Judge Barbie retails for $12.99 and is available at Barbie.com, Target, Walmart and Amazon.com.\n\n\"Our hope is that girls will enjoy playing with the dolls and imagine themselves protecting the rights of others,\" McKnight said.\n\nBut Barbie is going even further than its toys to close the \"dream gap.\"\n\nA partnership with GoFundMe\n\nA year ago, the company launched the \"Barbie Dream Gap Project\" in an effort raise awareness of the issue. Now, near the project's anniversary and Day of the Girl, Barbie is partnering with GoFundMe to raise money to support girl-empowerment programs.\n\n\"We need not only to continue to heighten awareness and consciousness about this phenomenon that is happening, but we also need to start working towards solutions to close the dream gap,\" McKnight said.\n\nThe company is encouraging donations to the Barbie Dream Gap Project Fund to help close the dream gap. The money will benefit three nonprofit organizations: She's The First, She Should Run and Step Up.\n\nThe Barbie brand is 'thriving'\n\nBarbie has made headlines in the past few years as it tries to keep up with kids' shift from analog toys to electronics.\n\nIn 2016, the company launched a Iine of dolls that come in different body shapes: tall, petite and curvy. Earlier this year, Mattel launched Sally Ride Barbie and Rosa Parks Barbie.\n\nMost recently, the company debuted a line of gender-neutral dolls.\n\nMcKnight said that the evolution has been successful.\n\n\"We have the most diverse and inclusive doll line in the world,\" she said, adding that the brand is \"thriving.\"\n\n\"We've had seven consecutive quarters of growth we are gaining market share in a very competitive environment. The sentiment and response to the brand as been tremendous.\"\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/07/barbie-debuts-judge-dolls-partners-gofundme-close-dream-gap/3862758002/", "description": "Barbie is partnering with fundraising giant GoFundMe to raise money for its \"Barbie Dream Gap Project\" in it's ongoing effort to empower girls.", "authors": ["Amy Haneline", "Published A.M.
