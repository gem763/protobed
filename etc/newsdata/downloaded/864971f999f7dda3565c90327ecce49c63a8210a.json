And yes, of course a sustainable transformed world will include lots of new benefits. But you have to understand. This is not primarily an opportunity to create new green jobs, new businesses or green economic growth. This is above all an emergency, and not just any emergency. This is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced.\u201d Her primary ideological commitment is to survival, in whatever form it may take. She envisions a world in which we force ourselves to make do with less, not one where we sustain expectations of more.\n\n\n\nThis is essentially the view of the climate situation laid out by University of Manitoba environmental scientist Vaclav Smil\u2019s new book Growth, which was excerpted this week in New York magazine. \u201c[N]o government has ever made policies with the biosphere in mind,\u201d it reads. \u201cNo government has advocated moderate, subdued economic growth as its priority, even in the world\u2019s most affluent countries, and no major political party has been serious about reconsidering the pace of economic growth.\u201d Seriousness, for Smil and other pessimistic climate analysts, would mean accepting a world of \u201cdeliberately declining levels and performances that would put civilization into a state of \u2018regress.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThis noun alone illuminates our predicament,\u2019 Smil writes. \u201cUsing regress as a qualifier of civilizational achievement, after a long-lasting addiction to progress, seems unreal. This creates an irreconcilable conflict or, more accurately, a challenge for which we have yet to find an effective solution (assuming that one exists).\u201d\n\n\n\nThe leaders at the U.N. who greeted Thunberg warmly and cheered her bravery had made very few large commitments of any kind by the end of Monday\u2019s summit, much less any pledges in keeping with the concept of \u201cregress.\u201d \u201cWhile countries were expected to come to the Summit to announce that they would enhance their climate ambition, most of the major economies fell woefully short,\u201d World Resources Institute head Andrew Steer said in a statement afterwards. \u201cSmaller nations, especially the most vulnerable countries, are pushing ahead. But we need far greater national leadership on climate action\u2014and we need it now.\u201d\n\nThis is what conservatives mocking and scolding liberals for the attention they\u2019ve paid Thunberg don\u2019t understand. Thunberg isn\u2019t being applauded because she\u2019s being taken seriously. She\u2019s being applauded because she\u2019s not.\n\nThunberg isn\u2019t being applauded because she\u2019s being taken seriously. She\u2019s being applauded because she\u2019s not.\n\nThunberg\u2019s activism was ready-made for superficial and inspirational news stories about a new generation of climate activists, and those stories have made her an interesting vessel for a set of truly radical propositions. It\u2019s hard to imagine an academic calling for an end to economic growth being openly praised by American politicians the way that Thunberg has been. But Thunberg gets that praise only because her youth allows politicians and the press to flatten her image. For their purposes, Thunberg isn\u2019t a precocious advocate for a new way of thinking about society, but an instrument of performative self-flagellation. The powerful nod vigorously when Thunberg castigates them, not in agreement with what she says must be done, but in the hopes that nodding might be considered an acceptable substitute. This is an iteration of the guilt suffused throughout liberal politics, which often seems better suited to producing tears and slogans than genuine change.\n\n\n\nThunberg is a case study in what Cornel West has often called, in relation to the radicalism of Martin Luther King Jr., \u201cSanta Clausification\u201d\u2014the softening of a public figure\u2019s profile into something more anodyne and broadly acceptable. This often takes years, but Thunberg might not need as much time\u2014the necessary elisions have already begun. We should try, nevertheless, to engage seriously with her actual words, whether we agree fully with her vision of the future or not, and learn, too, from the example set by the mass mobilizations she has inspired. She\u2019s asked us not to watch her, or applaud her, but to join her.", "description": "Many of the Swedish climate activist's putative allies aren't down for the cause.
