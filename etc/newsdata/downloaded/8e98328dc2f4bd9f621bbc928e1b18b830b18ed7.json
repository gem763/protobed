With normal highs falling through the 70s, we should expect plenty of nice days to some. Today has certainly been one.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: If you liked Tuesday evening, you\u2019ll love this one. It\u2019s ideal for any outdoor plans. We probably end up a few degrees cooler overall, and skies remain largely clear through the night. Temperatures settle to the upper 40s to upper 50s for lows. Winds are light after dark.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Thursday): It\u2019ll be feeling legitimately like fall as we come off somewhat crisp morning lows and only rise to the low- and mid-70s for highs. Plan on lots of sun to go with it! Winds are out of the east about 5 to 10 mph.\n\nSee Dan Stillman\u2019s forecast through the weekend.

The average high in the District fell into the 70s yesterday. By the end of the month, the average will have dipped to 74. From there, we lose about a degree every two to three days. October starts with an average high of 74 and ends with an average high of 64.
