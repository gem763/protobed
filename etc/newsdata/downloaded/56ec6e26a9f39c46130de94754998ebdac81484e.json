It later emerged the youngster had not trained the dogs herself when her dad performed on German TV with a very similar performance.\n\nDespite the drama, Alexa was back in action for BGT: The Champions - along with her eight pooches - to impress the judges and viewers with a series of tricks.\n\nBut it was Geordie duo Ant and Dec who were the most enthralled, using their Golden Buzzer vote to send Alexa straight to the final.\n\nAnt said it was 'one of the best dog acts we've ever had on Britain's Got Talent.\"\n\nPaddy & Nico - David's Golden Buzzer Act\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nDavid Walliams became uncharacteristically emotional by the salsa dancing duo and sent them straight through to the final.\n\nAge-defying Nico, 85, and dance partner Paddy, 45, had the whole audience on their feet as they performed a number of fast moves.\n\nAt one point Nico grabbed Paddy by her hand and foot and swung her around in the air, before sweeping her across the stage floor.\n\nAs the dance came to an end, those in the crowd immediately told David to press his buzzer, while the pair were clearly emotional.\n\nDavid told them: \"There are very few acts you can watch with a smile on your face, and tears in your eyes.\n\n\"This is one of the most joyous, most beautiful, most life affirming acts we've ever had on Britain's Got Talent.\"\n\nIn sweet scenes Paddy then told David: \"David is a very special name to me, it was my husband's name,\" to which in a tribute he replied: \"This is for him.\"\n\nStavros Flatley - Simon's Golden Buzzer Act\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nWhat started as a hilarious outtake on Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance routine, has ended up being a very lucrative turn for the father-son dance duo.\n\nThe favourites from Britain's Got Talent series Three impressed head judge Simon so much on their comeback that he awarded them a place in Saturday's final.\n\nBut despite their popularity, the pair stunned fans by announcing they are to split just days before the final.\n\n23-year-old Lagi Demetriou said that he will leave the group so that he can concentrate on his barber shop in Cyprus.\n\nWith Satuday's performance now being their swansong, could the duo go all the way?\n\nTwist and Pulse - Alesha's Golden Buzzer Act\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAlesha's pick narrowly missed out on the top prize on Britain's Got Talent Series 4, but after losing out to Spellbound this time they'll be hoping they can go all the way.\n\nTwist & Pulse, otherwise known as Ashley Glaze and Glen Murphy, combine street dance with comic asides for a very unique performance.\n\nWhen Alesha sent the London lads straight through to the final three the delighted duo cried: \"This means so much to us!\"\n\n\"I know it does, I loved every minute of it,\" Alesha replied.\n\nBello and Annaliese Nock\n\n(Image: Dymond/Thames/Syco/REX)\n\nThe father and dance duo describe themselves as 'Comic Daredevils' and the fearless family members are bound to put on an epic show on Saturday's final.\n\nIn their heat, Bello and Annaliese performed one of the most dangerous acts in the show's history.\n\nThere were serious fears that father and daughter duo Bello and Annaliese Nock would die during their death-defying routine in 'the wheel of death'.\n\nThe daredevil Americans could easily have fallen to their deaths while rotating in giant rings on separate ends of a swing that kept getting faster.\n\nThe judges had their hearts in their mouths as they watched the pair jumping, doing flips and climbing on the contraption.\n\nBello then pretended he was losing his balance and seemed like he was going to fall.\n\nAmanda Holden's jaw dropped, David Walliams struggled to watch, and Ant confessed: \"That was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever seen.\"\n\nWhat will they have up their sleeves for the final?\n\nMersey Girls\n\n(Image: Tom Dymond)\n\nJulie, Annie, Alice, Rebecca and Poppy formed Mersey Girls when they were just five years old. BGT viewers will remember the talented troupe from Series 11 in 2017.\n\nNow they're set to take to the stage once again in The Champions finals.\n\nAlesha even admitted that had she not already used her golden buzzer, the girls would most certainly receive it.\n\nSimon has a special relationship with the group. He was so moved by the story of Julie Carlie, who was born with painful back condition scoliosis that he used his own money to pay for her to have life-changing surgery so she could continue dancing.\n\nSpeaking to the Mirror after returning to her training, Julie said: \"Dancing again, surrounded by my friends, is the best feeling in the world.\"\n\nDarcey Oake\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nBGT 2014's daredevil illusionist Darcy leaves audiences on the edges of their seats waiting to see if the act goes to plan.\n\nThe judges were left completely gobsmacked by his routine in the semi-finals and Darcey will no doubt be pulling out all the stops for his next performance.\n\nDarcey confirmed his act was inspired by his childhood and his dad, wanting to pay homage after his support.\n\nBars and Melody\n\nBars and Melody are a pop duo consisting of rapper Leondre 'Bars' Devries and Charlie 'Melody' Lenehan.\n\nThey first sang together on BGT way back in 2014. While they finished in third place, their first audition went on to become the most watched ever with more than 200million views.\n\nThe duo signed a \u00a3500,00 record deal with Simon Cowell's record label Syco and released Hopeful in July 2014.\n\nThe pair went onto have huge success in Japan, touring in Osaka, Tokyo and Nagoya.\n\nBrs and Melody then wowed fans of the Champions series with their grown up new look. They performed their own song Here Comes The Sun.\n\nPreacher Lawson\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThe US funnyman had the British audience in stitches with his stand-up comedy routine and is hoping to tickle funnybones in the final this Saturday.\n\nIt's not Preacher's first time competing with such high stakes. After becoming a finalist on America's Got Talent, the 29-year-old went on to finish in fifth place on America's Got Talent: The Champions.\n\nCould it be a case of second time lucky?\n\nPreacher certainly has Ant and Dec's vote after leaving them howling when he licked Ant's face after his first performance.\n\nWe'll have to see what he has in store for his next turn.\n\nBritain's Got Talent: The Champions final airs Saturday October 5 at 8.30pm on ITV", "description": "The ten acts hoping to be crowned winner of the 2019 series revealed - including Stavros Flatley who will perform for the final time", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Itv", "Dymond Thames Syco Rex", "Tom Dymond"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20140734.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Simon-Cowells-golden-buzzer-revealed-as-Stavros-Flatley_4505JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
