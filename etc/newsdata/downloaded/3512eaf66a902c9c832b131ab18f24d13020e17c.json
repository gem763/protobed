That authorization, announced Aug. 27, was based on what was then determined to be \"lower-than-expected contract costs.\" But the Defense Department revealed in the Monday filing that the department would not be able to cover the costs of the project.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Defense Department initially authorized the funding after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determined that it would likely be able to afford the projects using the counter-drug funds, but the Army Corps said it would not know the full financial situation until later in the fiscal year.\n\nThe Army Corps ultimately advised the department that the funds would not cover the project, prompting its withdrawal on Sept. 13, according to a document attached to the court filing.\n\nThe border projects are part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to use Pentagon funds to deliver on President Donald Trump's keystone campaign promise of a border wall. Earlier this year, the president demanded Congress come up with billions of dollars for a wall on the border with Mexico. After Congress declined that request and the government went into its longest shutdown in U.S. history, Trump declared a national emergency to divert defense funds toward border barriers.\n\nTapping into Pentagon funds for a border wall has prompted numerous legal challenges, including by the House, which argued it violated Congress' constitutional power of the purse. A judge later dismissed the House suit.\n\nThe Supreme Court gave the green light in July for the administration to use $2.5 billion in Pentagon funds to replace already extant border infrastructure in California, Arizona and New Mexico, overturning blocks imposed by lower courts.\n\n", "description": "Money was diverted to the projects, but it wasn\u2019t enough.", "authors": ["Matthew Choi"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/70/e3/c56468e44b6ea5edbcdb58c08363/190916-border-wall-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
