The real question for the markets is what\u2019s next, and the answer seems even more uncertain than usual.\n\nSome strategists contend robust economic readings would have justified standing pat on rates at the just-concluded two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Others point to forward-looking financial indicators, such as the yield curve and the dollar, saying they support further rate reductions.\n\nBoth arguments have merit. But for now, odds favor at least one more quarter-point cut, perhaps by year end, or early in 2020.\n\nThat split of opinion was evident in the dissents from the FOMC. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George dissented in favor of holding rates steady, as they had in July, when the FOMC made its initial rate cut. But St. Louis Fed President James Bullard favored a half-point cut this time. The other seven votes on the panel split the difference and lowered the federal-funds target range a quarter point, to 1.75%-2%.\n\nThe median of the so-called dot plot\u2014based on FOMC members\u2019 projections of where they think the fed-funds rate will end the year\u2014indicates it will be unchanged from the new range. But, as our colleague Matthew Klein points out, the modal (most prevalent) guess was for a 1.625% rate, a quarter-point below the new midpoint.\n\nThe median was skewed by five dots predicting that the funds rate would end the year at 2.125%, the midpoint of the old range, implying an increase, which is nowhere in the realm of possibility. Just guessing, but those projections may have represented the policy preferences of some Fed presidents who sided with Rosengren and George but didn\u2019t have votes on the FOMC this year, not what\u2019s likely to happen.\n\nDrew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management, says he would have been in the camp of waiting to lower rates. (\u201cNot that they asked me,\u201d he quips.)\n\nRead more: The Fed Is Getting Ready to Cut Rates Again. That Might Do More Harm Than Good.\n\nEconomic numbers have been close to the Fed\u2019s forecasts, including inflation, Matus notes. Meanwhile, lots of uncertainties on the geopolitical front lie ahead in the next 90 days, notably on the trade front. Given that, he says, he\u2019d prefer to hold off and not have the Fed use its \u201climited ammunition\u201d just yet.\n\nDomestic conditions are favorable, agrees Jim Caron, head of macro fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, but adds global factors such as the U.S.-China trade war make him \u201cmore sympathetic\u201d to Bullard\u2019s call for a half-point cut. The reactions in the bond and currency markets also show the Fed wasn\u2019t doing enough as the yield curve flattened and the dollar firmed.\n\nCaron sees the greater risk of policy moving too slowly. \u201cAn aggressive cut would rebuild inflation expectations, rather than [the] slow dripping\u201d of incremental moves. \u201cHow\u2019s that worked for Japan?\u201d he asks rhetorically.\n\nIn his press conference, Powell said the Fed was prepared to act aggressively if the economy weakened, which was a more dovish tilt than the FOMC\u2019s statement. That slight difference in tone appeared to lift the stock market from its initial losses after the Fed decision at midafternoon to finish about even on the session.\n\nPowell also indicated the Fed could resume the expansion of its balance sheet sooner than expected, which potentially would help to counter the dislocations seen this week in the repurchase agreement market. This wouldn\u2019t represent a resumption of quantitative easing, or QE, to stimulate the economy. Instead, the adding of assets, which are mainly Treasury securities, would passively match the increase in the Fed\u2019s liabilities such as currency in circulation and the Treasury\u2019s deposits at the Fed. Failing to offset these liabilities would actually represent a tightening of bank reserves.\n\nFor now, the market sees the Fed cutting rates at least one more time by one-quarter percentage point from the new fed-funds range. Fed-funds futures put a 58.7% probability of that happening in December and 73.3% chance by January, according to the CME FedWatch site.\n\nOdds of further rate cuts have receded in the past month in tandem with the snapback in bond yields. But, as Powell also emphasized in his press conference, the Fed has been quick to alter its stance from tightening to easing as conditions changed over the past year.\n\nAfter all, the crystal ball of both the market and the Fed have proven a bit cloudy. For instance, in late 2018, the dot plot had the fed-funds rate exceeding 3% by the end of 2019, more than a full percentage point above the new range. Too bad the central bank can\u2019t use Sharpies to correct that.\n\nWrite to Randall W.
