But the company's core operations generated cash in the quarter and GE raised its cash-flow outlook for the year.\n\nLarry Culp, who took over as CEO about a year ago, has been revamping GE with a focus on cutting its debt and generating cash from its businesses of making jet engines and power turbines.\n\nGE reported adjusted cash flow from industrial operations of $650 million for the third quarter and predicted it would generate as much as $2 billion of cash on that basis for the full year.\n\nGE's struggles in recent years -- including a gutting of its dividend largely stemming from deep problems in its power business and financial services division -- have made cash flow the most important financial measure for investors. GE previously projected 2019 cash flow ranging from negative $1 billion to positive $1 billion, an estimate it increased in July.\n\nIn the third quarter, GE reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $9.47 billion, compared with a year-ago loss of $22.8 billion, when it booked a big charge on its troubled power business. Revenue was flat at $23.36 billion as gains in aviation and health-care units were offset by declines in power.\n\nGE booked an $8.7 billion charge to reflect the lowered value of its investment in oil equipment and services firm Baker Hughes. The company also recorded a $1 billion charge on its legacy insurance business and a $740 million write-down on the value of its hydropower business.\n\nExcluding charges, GE said its adjusted earnings were 15 cents a share, ahead of an analyst projection of 12 cents a share, according to Refinitiv.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 06:59 ET (10:59 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
