But for 54-year-old Antje Fitzner, from Durmersheim in Germany, it was sadly not to be.\n\nShe was travelling with family members on Saturday, 12 October from OR Tambo airport in Johannesburg to the Kruger National Park when their vehicle was in a head-on collision near Dullstroom on the N4 highway.\n\n\u201cThere are often roadworks on that road and we suspect they\u2019d swerved to avoid roadwork signs when they collided with the other car,\u201d says Deon Broekman from emergency service Rapid Response.\n\nThe German tourists were travelling in two cars.\n\nAntje was sitting in the back seat and wearing her seatbelt, but the force of the impact is said to have made the seatbelt cause massive internal injuries.\n\nShe had internal bleeding, a head injury and a cracked pelvis.\n\n\u201cWe gave her three units of blood on the scene before airlifting her to the Lenmed Hospital in [Johannesburg],\u201d Deon says. \u201cIt took us more than an hour to stabilise her at the scene.\u201d\n\nAntje died from her injuries the next day.\n\nAntje\u2019s remains will be flown to Germany.", "description": "She\u2019d been looking forward to seeing the Big Five and having sundowners on the shores of the Sabie River.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9473/ac01548c77b8411ea5acd385bf1b5485.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
