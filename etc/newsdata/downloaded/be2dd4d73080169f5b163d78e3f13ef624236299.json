If so, you will be affected.

Users won't be able to pay for new services, and they won't be eligible for refunds.\n\nAdobe cited the White House's Executive Order 13884 as the reason why customers won't be getting refunds.\n\nSigned in August, President Trump's order imposed new economical sanctions on Venezuela, citing human rights violations carried out by the regime of Venezuela's current president, Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe order, backed by the US Department of Treasury, bans US companies from having any business relations with Venezuelan entities, may they be private companies, government organizations, non-profits, or individual citizens.\n\nThe US has similar full bans on other countries as well. The list includes Iran, North Korea, and Syria.\n\nNot all US companies follow these bans, but the bigger tech giants do follow US Treasury sanctions to the letter of the law.\n\nGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, and many others are known for banning users from the above-mentioned countries. The latest case is Microsoft, who in July, started enforcing the US Treasury ban/sanctions list on GitHub, a service it bought last year.", "description": "Because of the White House's sanctions, users aren't eligible for refunds either.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/07/a60dcf01-d308-4d58-b8bc-6140e8d850d8/thumbnail/770x578/59f6a7b4fde5a63da7d9ecc3f16672ab/adobe-apps-logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
