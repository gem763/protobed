After all, Monday\u2019s incident wasn\u2019t the first incident of tweetboat diplomacy. In April 2018, for instance, he warned Russia by tweet not to \u201cbe partners with a Gas Killing Animal\u201d and that US missiles would be coming \u201cnice and new and \u2018smart!\u2019\u201d\n\nIn July 2018, he tweeted\u2014in all-caps\u2014to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani \u201cNEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.\u201d\n\nAnd in September 2017, he responded to a United Nations speech by North Korea\u2019s foreign minister with the tweet: \u201cIf he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won\u2019t be around much longer!\u201d\n\nTweets like these should be viewed as a symptom more than a cause, one backed up by numerous other Trumpian statements. The president either does not understand the responsibilities of his job or he is unfit to discharge them. In either case, he cannot be trusted to fulfil his constitutional obligation to \u201cfaithfully execute\u201d the duties of his office.\n\nThat condition collides with the reality that decades of congressional incapacity and inaction have left the presidency even stronger than when Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. wrote The Imperial Presidency.\n\nWeakened checks and balances\n\nThe 2001 Authorisation for the Use of Military Force continues to be cited by the executive branch as granting practical carte blanche to wage war, even against Iran. Similarly, long-standing traditions about the responsible use of national security clauses in statutes regulating foreign trade and investment have been blown away as Trump has used them to conduct politically motivated trade wars with China and other countries, including in Europe. Despite occasional congressional criticism and even votes, both economic and security powers remain firmly in the grasp of the president\u2019s hands.\n\nWith checks and balances having weakened so far, the importance of a stable, competent president has only increased. Instead, the United States has someone who seriously pursued buying Greenland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn theory, the US constitution offers a fix to this problem through the 25th Amendment. Adopted in the wake of President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s heart attacks and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the amendment specifies that the vice president and a majority of the cabinet (or another body specified by Congress) may declare the president unable to discharge the duties of the office, leaving the vice president in charge.\n\nThe amendment was meant to resolve a long-standing question of what would happen if the president were not dead or clearly impeachable but merely incapacitated. The original text merely stated that the powers of the president would devolve to the vice president in case of \u201cinability.\u201d Even in the Philadelphia Convention itself, the delegate John Dickinson remarked that it was too vague and it was unclear who would judge that disability. The convention, however, never resolved those questions, inadvertently producing a terrifying tradition in which American government could not manage the challenges of a president physically incapable of office.\n\nTwo incidents demonstrate the problem of being unable to respond to presidential incapacity. On July 2, 1881, President James Garfield, four months into his term, was shot by Charles Guiteau at a train station. The president took 79 agonising days to die, during which time the United States essentially lacked a president. Amazingly, almost the same situation recurred when Woodrow Wilson suffered a stroke in 1919; his wife and staff refused entreaties to have his vice president temporarily assume the president\u2019s powers, and at the climax of the fight over the League of Nations the United States again lacked a clear president. There are claims that other presidents had debilitating conditions, such as Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s hypertension or Ronald Reagan\u2019s cognitive decline, that might have risen to the level of presidential impairment.\n\nThe 25th Amendment\n\nThe 25th Amendment was meant to provide a respectful means for legislators and others to deal with those sorts of illnesses or temporary disabilities without resorting to impeachment. But Trump is not ill in the way Wilson or Roosevelt was, and whatever drives him to engage in such flagrantly reckless behaviour is not temporary.\n\nAnd although the amendment may have answered Dickinson\u2019s question about who would judge the president to be unable to fulfil his duty, leaving the choice of determining presidential incapacity to the vice president and cabinet made the process inescapably political.\n\nPolitics also would probably prevent Congress from exercising its ability under the amendment to transfer the cabinet\u2019s ability to declare the president unfit to some other body\u2014as one doctor has suggested, to a board of doctors and psychologists who would provide independent examinations. (That suggestion, made in 1994, uncomfortably foreshadowed Trump\u2019s transparent dishonesty about providing his health records.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd impeachment, too, seems to be off the table. Leaving aside the question of what it would take to convince Republican senators to convict, House majority leaders seem to have concluded that the president\u2019s public doings do not rise to impeachable offenses. In response to the disclosure of the formerly secret memo summarising the president\u2019s July conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives was rebranding its investigations into the president as an impeachment inquiry. Yet despite being even more blatant, none of what the president has done in public, from his erratic diplomacy to his operating a hotel soliciting business from foreign governments, triggered such a reaction.\n\nIt is ironic that the United States finds itself in the predicament of living under an executive unfit to rule but unable to be removed. After all, the country was born in an independence struggle against a British government headed by King George III. That king had what may have been a profound mental illness, which eventually led Parliament to declare his son regent. The benefits of an unwritten constitution meant that Parliament had great flexibility in dealing with the challenge.\n\nThe US constitution, by contrast, aimed to temper the possibility of abuse of the laws by either a rogue executive or a legislature. The Framers aimed to ensure that political tussles would not end with bloodshed: Impeachment carries the penalty of conviction, not beheading, and the president cannot order legislators imprisoned on their way to sessions of Congress.\n\nFord invoked that aspiration of a rational, orderly frame of government when he assured Americans on replacing Nixon that \u201cour long national nightmare is over.\u201d Nine hundred and ninety-two days into the Trump administration, it seems, the nightmare is really only beginning.\n\nPaul Musgrave is an assistant professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.", "description": "Trump is unfit for office but the system has no answers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.491%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_395/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8d8556aed37efdf2570ed72f54a71c2b08e29708", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
