He can actually come out and say things that other NBA players cannot say.\"\n\nLEBRON JAMES' CRITICISM OF HONG KONG TWEET FROM DARYL MOREY RECEIVES BACKLASH ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nInstead of criticizing Morey as either \"misinformed or not educated,\" James could have used the opportunity to rise above the debate and show strong support for Hong Kong.\n\n\"In the moment, he could've sent a message by saying something that really understood the value of free speech, expressed some sympathy for the American-flag-waving kids who are in the streets in Hong Kong,\" Domenech said.\n\nThe demonstrators, he said, are \"protesting on behalf of a defense of their personal autonomy and freedom and independence.\"\n\nOn Monday, James was slammed after he criticized as \"misinformed\" a general manager's tweet supporting Hong Kong's ongoing pro-democracy protests \u2014 and then doubled down in a damage control tweet, saying the online show of support for the embattled demonstrators \"could have waited a week.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJames, who's considered one of the more outspoken athletes on social justice issues in a league that prides itself on being one of the most progressive in sports, was uncharacteristically deferential to NBA and Chinese leadership in his remarks about Morey's tweet of a slogan \u2013 \"Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong\" \u2013 expressing support for those marching in Hong Kong.\n\nThe single tweet from Morey's personal account was soon deleted, but not before spurring a rebuke from some within the NBA and inciting a backlash in China. Authorities in the communist country last week canceled publicity events and news conferences and banned the broadcast last week of an exhibition game between the Brooklyn Nets and James' Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to judge how the league handled the situation,\" the perennial All-Star told reporters in Los Angeles on Monday night. \"I just think that, when you\u2019re misinformed or you\u2019re not educated about something \u2013 and I\u2019m just talking about the tweet itself \u2013 you never know the ramifications that can happen. We all see what that did, not only did for our league but for all of us in America, for people in China as well. Sometimes you have to think through the things that you say that may cause harm not only for yourself but for the majority of people. I think that\u2019s just a prime example of that.\u201d\n\nFox News' Cody Derespina contributed to this report.", "description": "NBA star LeBron James had a chance to make a strong statement in support of pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong\u00a0but failed when he criticized another team's general manager, according to\u00a0Federalist publisher Ben Domenech.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Domenech-James_FOx-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
