FUNDAMENTALS * The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were up 0.1% at $9.28-3/4 a bushel by 0102 GMT, having closed down 0.6% on Wednesday. * The most active corn futures were little changed at$3.92 a bushel, having closed down 0.4% in the previous session. * The most active wheat futures were up 0.4% at $5.15-1/2 a bushel, having closed up 1.2% on Wednesday. * Traders are looking for fresh Chinese demand for U.S. agricultural products. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that China had agreed to purchase $40 billion to $50 billion worth of U.S. agricultural goods in a first phase of an agreement to end a 15-month trade war. * But China would make the purchases only if Trump rolls back levies put in place since the trade war began, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. * The U.S. Department of Agriculture late on Tuesday said the U.S. corn harvest was 22% complete and the soybean harvest was 26% complete. MARKET NEWS * The euro got off to an unusually quiet start in Asia on Monday, having posted its worst weekly performance in three months, as investors await more developments and ratings downgrades from Europe. * Oil edged lower in volatile trading on Friday, posting a second consecutive weekly loss as caution about Europe's debt crisis and year-end positioning continued to spark selling into rallies. * A rally in U.S. stocks fizzled, leaving major indexes with modest gains on Friday, as Wall Street was torn between hope that U.S. economic data signals better times ahead and fear Europe's debt crisis will engulf world economies.
