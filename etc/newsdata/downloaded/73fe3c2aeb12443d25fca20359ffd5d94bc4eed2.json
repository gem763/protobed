With so many popular credit cards offering bonus rewards on grocery spending, this is a category that can translate to substantial points or cash back.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\n$266 cash back with the Blue Cash Preferred Amex\n\nThe Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express earns 6% cash back at US supermarkets, on up to $6,000 worth of spending per year.

That's a pretty substantial amount of cash that can be reinvested into paying household bills \u2014 or the next grocery run.\n\nCash-back rewards are a great choice for people who don't want to spend time researching the best redemption value with different travel programs.
