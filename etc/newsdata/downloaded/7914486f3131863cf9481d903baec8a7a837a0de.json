Climate Session\n\nYouTube\n\nGreta Thunberg has a message for world leaders at the United Nations this week: \"We'll be watching you.\" Speaking at the Climate Action Summit in New York, Thunberg added, \"This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school, on the other side of the ocean.\"\n\nBut instead, Thunberg, 16, is trying to convince politicians to take climate change seriously, and to do something to stop a global warming trend that will affect the world's children more than it affects anyone who's currently in power.\n\nIn an impassioned speech, Thunberg told those who hold office, \"you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words, and yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing.\"\n\nSaying that the world is now in the early stages of a mass extinction, Thunberg criticized those who still speak of the crisis in terms of money and economic growth.\n\n\"How dare you?\" she asked again, growing increasingly emotional as the audience cheered at the 2019 Climate Action Summit.\n\nCiting more than 30 years' worth of scientific studies and warnings that greenhouse gases and other factors were establishing a dangerous new environmental trend, Thunberg criticized politicians for not developing solutions and strategies to confront that threat.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that. Because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil. And that I refuse to believe.\"\n\nThunberg then drilled into one aspect of a current international plan, which includes the goal of cutting current emissions levels in half over the next 10 years.\n\nBut that plan, she said, only provides a 50% chance of keeping the warming trend below 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"Fifty percent may be acceptable to you,\" Thunberg said, before listing the many assumptions that underlie the estimate and the challenges that could thwart success.\n\n\"They also rely on my generation sucking hundreds of billions of tons of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist. So, a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us \u2014 we who have to live with the consequences.\"\n\nThunberg's speech at a U.N. climate conference last December continues to draw viewers, captured by her direct tone and the clarity of her analysis of a complicated issue. For Monday's speech in New York, the Swedish activist shared the stage with U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who praised the youth movement for raising awareness for climate action.\n\nIn her remarks, Thunberg accused politicians of pretending that the world's dire climate problems can be solved with technical solutions and \"business as usual.\"\n\nTo back up her point, she cited a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded that for the world to preserve its best chance of meeting the 1.5-degree goal, countries had a \"total carbon budget\" of 420 gigatons of CO2 at the start of 2018 \u2014 meaning that together, countries shouldn't exceed that amount.\n\n\"Today, that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatons,\" Thunberg said, adding that at current emission rates, the carbon budget laid out by the IPCC \"will be entirely gone in less than eight and a half years.\"\n\nThunberg added, \"There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures here today, because these numbers are too uncomfortable and you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is.\"\n\nTo those wielding power, the activist said, \"You are failing us, but young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say: We will never forgive you.\"\n\n\"We will not let you get away with this,\" she added. \"Right here, right now is where we draw the line.\"\n\nThunberg concluded her remarks by saying, \"The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.\"\n\nIn a sign of her growing prominence, Thunberg's remarks at the climate summit immediately preceded speeches from leaders such as Pope Francis and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern.\n\nPresident Trump made a surprise visit to the same auditorium where Thunberg spoke \u2014 but the U.S. president arrived shortly after she concluded her remarks, entering while India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke.", "description": "\"This is all wrong.
