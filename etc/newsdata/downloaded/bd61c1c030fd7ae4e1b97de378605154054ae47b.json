How do you deal with incompatible needs in the bedroom? And what do you do when your boyfriend is closeted to protect himself from his conservative parents?\n\nIt\u2019s time to overwrite those old save files and start a New Game + for your relationships. Let\u2019s do this.\n\nDear Dr. NerdLove, I got married to my partner a few days ago, and already think we\u2019re in trouble. While we were planning our wedding, his uncle passed away and his cousins he is very close with were left with the house. It was a massive fixer upper \u2014 his uncle was an alcoholic hoarder and it took months and even several dumpsters to even get the house to a point that it could begin renovations. However, my husband used to work in home improvement and the price on the home was so low it was a hard offer to pass on. We planned on taking out a home improvement loan that would cover the cost of the repairs comfortably and then remortgage through a VA loan once we were married. However, apparently all the banks in the area would not give out a home improvement loan until 6 months after the house has been purchased. This meant that all the money we planned on using for the wedding would have to be split on renovations also. On top of that, we were planning on moving into the house from our cheap apartment by the time the wedding came around, but we still do not have a finished bathroom. There is one working toilet. While we plan on moving in next month, we still lost one month\u2019s rent we weren\u2019t expecting to pay. There is so much equity to be had in this house, and the family is really happy that we\u2019re keeping it in the family. We have considered selling it once it\u2019s in good enough shape, even if people want us to keep it. My husband also recently changed jobs too and took a small pay cut in exchange for stability and overall a more pleasant experience. He\u2019s a pharmacist and his previous job would have him working every other weekend, some 12-14 hour days, never given any lunch breaks or even little breaks. It was retail and he was expected to hit unreal numbers with too few hours, so he worked a lot of unpaid hours just trying to keep afloat. We just wrapped up the wedding a few days ago, but with the new job and issues with the house we are beginning to slip into debt. My view on it is that with the wedding behind us, we can focus on getting into the house and begin paying off the accumulated debt. He makes a good amount of money and while we are in a bad spot now, it would be hard for a lot of other couples to even make it through these past few months without much more debt. His view on it is that I forced him to have an expensive wedding and now he has to constantly work and has to pick up shifts in his old retail job in order to pay. I understand this, however, when we got engaged he asked if I had wanted a wedding. I said I\u2019d like one if we could swing it, but I\u2019d like it cheap and small and I wouldn\u2019t be mad if we didn\u2019t do it. He repeatedly told me that I wouldn\u2019t be happy if we didn\u2019t have a wedding and that he didn\u2019t want me to be mad about it 10 years later. He even initiated wedding planning \u2014 found a venue, set up a time to meet with them, started looking for DJs and caterers. He hadn\u2019t booked anything, but I was thinking maybe it was a sort of excuse \u2014 he wanted me to have a wedding and it felt like no wasn\u2019t an answer. I\u2019m frustrated because we could have handled the wedding without all of our unforeseen circumstances (and with hindsight, bad decisions.) On top of this, him and I have an age gap \u2014 he is 39 and I am 27. I was in the Marines until I was 26, so I am going back to school now but I have a very meagre income and I\u2019ve just been going to school full time on the GI Bill. Even if I was to pick up a job and work full time, it wouldn\u2019t be as much as I would make just using the GI Bill and going to school, and I appreciate being able to focus 100 per cent on my schooling because some of the semesters I have had would have had much worse grades if I didn\u2019t have the time to devote to them. Literally 3 days after our wedding, I got home from dropping off the last of my visiting friends at the airport and I began to count the money we received from the wedding. It was about 20-25 per cent the cost of the wedding, and my husband told me he was expecting about one-third at the least to one-half. Obviously we didn\u2019t throw the wedding for the money, but with how rough things have gotten and how tight things have been he was disappointed we didn\u2019t receive more. He always complains about how his ex-girlfriend did nothing \u2014 had no job, didn\u2019t go to school, was a burden \u2014 and he has a lot of baggage regarding that. He hasn\u2019t directly said that about me, but the fact is I put out all the money I had (and then some) in order to help out, but last night he was just so angry about where we are financially and he becomes incredibly severe, hostile, and negative when he\u2019s angry. He holds onto his anger for a long time and it takes a lot to get him out of those moods. I thought when he switched jobs, he\u2019d be a lot happier and wouldn\u2019t be so angry so often. While he doesn\u2019t directly say I\u2019m a burden or I\u2019m useless, he complains a lot about how unclean the apartment is and just gets so negative and angry about money. I\u2019m beginning to think he has an anger problem, and I don\u2019t handle being around angry people well. With my husband especially, he gets so angry and negative I cry and break down. He doesn\u2019t say anything directly about me, but it\u2019s just the way he says things. I say that I have Fridays-Sundays off and I could pick up a part time job and work every day I\u2019m not at school; he says I won\u2019t make enough to make a difference. Anything I say he has a negative response about. I get that we\u2019re not in a good situation, but he\u2019s SO negative about it. Even this morning when he got up to go to work, I got up too and walked to the door to say goodbye and he had to say he\u2019s getting up to go work the fields again and was rude to me for just standing there. He asked me why I was following him, and I said I was getting up to say bye. He snipped at me for that. I\u2019m beginning to think this was all a mistake. I\u2019ve thought about leaving before because of his anger. We met through mutual gaming friends, and the only game he plays anymore is Overwatch. This is fine, but not even halfway through the first game of the night he is slamming his keyboard, slamming his mouse, yelling, asking me why he died on Pharah when I was Mercy, etc. etc. I\u2019m a huge gamer and I don\u2019t enjoy playing games with him at all because all of them piss him off instantly. He started saying gaming is pointless, useless, a waste of time, and that he never wants to play them again. He was really excited for classic WoW, but last night after playing for a few minutes he said it was boring. After we finished counting our money, he turned off WoW and bitterly said he couldn\u2019t afford the subscription and how useless it was. He\u2019s told me before that he regrets that we met through gaming because now he wants them out of his life completely, and yet they are my favourite past-time so it\u2019s hard to spend any time with each other. I\u2019m sorry this has been all over the place, but I think we have so many problems and they all interconnect in different ways. My main question is that I am not someone who leaves easily and I know marriage is hard work. However, I find myself thinking about if I\u2019d be able to leave once our debt was paid down a bit more. Once it wasn\u2019t so crippling. I wouldn\u2019t want to leave right after the wedding also, and my parents helped us out so much for the wedding. I don\u2019t want to waste their money. I also think about how stressed he is and how when he isn\u2019t angry, he\u2019s the best partner I\u2019ve ever had. I just feel like I\u2019m beginning to plan my escape in case I need it, in case he gets angrier and angrier. In case he never gets out of his foul mood. My biggest fear is that he will only get worse, that he will be emotionally abusive and I\u2019ll be trapped. We talked about wanting to start trying for kids right after we get married because of his age, but even that part of me is thinking \u201cDon\u2019t get off birth control, say it\u2019s the money holding you back.\u201d Because the money is a problem, but I just know it\u2019ll be even more of a mess if I have to leave with a kid. I just feel like leaving is constantly on the back of my mind, and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m setting myself up to fail. What if we would work out and have a long and happy marriage, that this is just a rough spot and because I have, in my mind, one foot almost out the door going to cause this to fail? I just feel like I need to have this considered through and through in case things don\u2019t get better. We\u2019ve been married 4 days and I\u2019m already thinking I\u2019ll need to leave. Is it wrong to plan out a worst case scenario? Already Time To Go?\n\nHoo boy.\n\nAlright ATTG, I\u2019m going to level with you: do NOT go off your birth control. Right now would be the worst possible time for you to decide to scramble your DNA with your husband. You\u2019ve got far too much going on here to work through to risk tying yourself to him any more tightly than you already have.\n\nNow with that having been said: your letter\u2019s got more red flags than the last lap at NASCAR. Frankly I\u2019m thinking that the two of you should never have gotten engaged, much less married. Your husband has serious anger and control issues. Like, future Lifetime Original Movie levels of issues.\n\nThe way that your husband steamrolled over your wishes about your wedding \u2014 without so much as consulting you \u2014 was a pretty big goddamn indicator that this was something the two of you needed to discuss. In detail. The fact that you felt like this wasn\u2019t something you could reasonably say no to was another bad sign. Relationships are partnerships, and while no relationship is perfectly equitable and balanced, the fact that you were dragged along in his wake isn\u2019t a good sign.\n\nBut there\u2019s \u201cthings to discuss, possibly with a couple sessions with a couples therapist\u201d and then there\u2019s \u201cexplosive, screaming anger.\u201d That\u2019s the more pressing issue, and I\u2019m a little worried that you\u2019re mistaking the symptoms for the disease.\n\nYes, issues like suddenly getting hit with debts you weren\u2019t expecting or hadn\u2019t budgeted for is incredibly stressful; money is probably the most common issue of strife in relationships. But it\u2019s one thing to be having to deal with sudden budget crises and another entirely for him to be getting in your face and screaming that it\u2019s your fault.\n\nHowever, this seems to be his modus operandi in general, and that\u2019s something to be concerned about. This is why I worry that you\u2019re focusing too much on the wrong thing. Because the truth is that right now, you\u2019re taking a lot of the blame for things that aren\u2019t actually your fault.\n\nWorse, you\u2019re taking on blame for things that you can\u2019t avoid. Because it doesn\u2019t matter whether things went perfectly with the loan, the wedding came in under budget, you had a full-time job and you were cleaning the house like Martha Stewart on a meth binge. There would always be a new reason why he\u2019d be pissed at you.\n\nThe fact is, he was always going to blow up at you. Even if you two had done a better job planning, crossed every t and dotted every lower-case j and didn\u2019t get blindsided by loan restrictions, then something would have set him off.\n\nIt might have been breakfast, it might have been shit at work, it might have been impossibly long server queues on WoW (recreating the classic WoW experience for those of us who were there from the jump\u2026) but something would have made him Hulk out, because he\u2019s an explosive rage monster looking for any reason to blow up, messily and all over the place.\n\nYou can pay your parents back; you can\u2019t get the time back from a horrible relationship.\n\nNow you\u2019re walking on eggshells around him in hopes that you\u2019re going to avoid triggering Mt. Assholeus and feeling like you can\u2019t enjoy anything that you used to love, and that is a huge, huge warning sign about where this relationship is headed.\n\nThis sort of behaviour is really high on the abusive relationship checklist, and that\u2019s a very good reason to be concerned.\n\nAnd frankly, I\u2019m here from the future to tell you this is only going to get worse, not better.\n\nIn an ideal world, you would\u2019ve pumped the brakes on things before they got to this point. In a less ideal world, the best choice would\u2019ve been putting off the wedding until things were more settled and you were less concerned about the way your husband acts. But hindsight is 20/20, and the only thing we can do is work with the facts as they currently stand.\n\nWhich brings us to the question of \u201cwhat do you do now?\u201d My advice is going to be contingent on something you don\u2019t mention in your letter: Does he ever blow up like this at other people \u2014 especially at people who might negatively affect his life \u2014 or is he able to hold shit together when he\u2019s around other people and coincidentally only Hulks out at you?\n\nIf you\u2019re the only person he ever rages at, or if he only does so at people who are weaker than him, then that\u2019s a sign to split so fast that you leave a human-shaped cloud behind. And if his anger isn\u2019t reserved exclusively for you\u2026 well, that\u2019s still not great.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna lie: I\u2019m more than a little concerned that there isn\u2019t going to be a good outcome here. I get that you don\u2019t want to give up on this relationship. It\u2019s admirable that you are committed to making this relationship work and putting in the effort to fix it. However, it\u2019s not your responsibility to fix things; it\u2019s your husband\u2019s responsibility to handle his shit.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to stay in this relationship \u2014 and that\u2019s a mighty big fucking if \u2014 then he needs to be getting his arse to therapy and anger management classes. But even then, these are not a guarantee that things will get fixed, especially if his behaviour is trending far more to the abuse side of the spectrum than \u201cundirected anger issues.\u201d\n\nWere I you, I\u2019d be putting some serious consideration into how you can leave this relationship as smoothly and safely as possible. Having an exit plan in place can make things much easier and more efficient for you if you do decide to pull the ripcord on this.\n\nYes, I understand that your parents invested a significant amount of money in your wedding. That doesn\u2019t obligate you to stay. That\u2019s just an example of the Sunk Cost Fallacy fucking with your head.\n\nYour safety and well-being are more valuable than the cost of the wedding. Hell, you would\u2019ve been perfectly within your rights to bail on the marriage during the ceremony if you felt like it was the best option. You can pay your parents back; you can\u2019t get the time back from a horrible relationship.\n\nIf you do decide that the best option for you is to leave, then it may not be a bad idea to see a couples counsellor as a way of smoothing the end of the relationship. Having a third party involved may make it easier and safer for you if you are legitimately worried for your health and safety.\n\nIf you are worried, then making a contingency plan is a smart move. Make sure you have copies of all of your important information such as your driver\u2019s licence, passport, banking information and insurance in a secure place that he doesn\u2019t have access to, along with cash and a mobile phone.\n\nI wish I had better advice for you. Hopefully I\u2019m reading more into your letter than is actually there and your husband will be willing to work on his issues and put in the effort to be the lover and partner you deserve. But it\u2019s a good idea to be prepared, just in case.\n\nGood luck. And write back to let us know how you\u2019re doing.\n\nDear Dr. NerdLove, I always look forward to reading your insight into people\u2019s relationships. Even if the cases are disparate and diverse, there\u2019s always plenty to learn from others\u2019 experiences. Now to give you some background, I\u2019m a gender non-conforming trans woman. I\u2019ve been parsing through my identity for a good four years with plenty of stumbles and also lots of successes as well. When I came out, dating was basically out of the question, I was too distraught about the fallout to want to focus my attention on anyone beside myself. So when I got on OKC I didn\u2019t really have an agenda as to what I was looking for. I ended up meeting my future wife on there. We lived in opposite parts of the country and we both had come out relatively recently out of borderline abusive and toxic relationships. Neither of us had much intention on rushing things. For a good few months, much of our relationship was purely talking and texting. She decided to come and visit the following year after maybe 4-5 months of talking pretty much non-stop. We both agreed that she should move with me fairly quickly. We ended up getting married less than a year later, originally for practical reasons, but also because it felt \u2018right.\u2019 We sort of fell into it and haven\u2019t looked back since. The relationship with her has felt easy, for lack of a better term. We communicate fairly openly, when issues arise we talk about it immediately and try and find common ground (which we often have). Now the only real point of contention is that our sex life is inconsistent. When we first started talking, I was devoid of any sex drive (part driven by hormone replacement therapy). I told her this right off the bat, I was identifying asexual because I hadn\u2019t really put much thought on what the reasoning was behind it. She accepted me for who I was, though it\u2019s one thing to understand that intellectually and a whole other one emotionally. She recently told me she has put up walls and from what I can glean, those walls are meant to protect my boundaries while putting her needs on the back burner. Within our relationship, I\u2019ve felt increasingly safer to explore my own identity including in a sexual context. I\u2019ve identified that my low sex drive stems from severe genital dysphoria. So when asked to perform as \u2018male\u2019 including being top, I shut down. Neither of us is very dominant when it comes to sex so it usually ends up being an impasse unless one of us gets the courage to do something neither of us is comfortable doing: initiating. Our intimacy when it happens is great. We both spend quite a bit of time with each other and when there\u2019s release it has been largely satisfying. I feel all kinds of guilt and shame for being such an inconsistent partner. Is there any such way to alter my sub tendencies? Sincerely, Submissive but Wanting to be Different\n\nIt\u2019s time to let go of your shame and guilt, SBWTBD. First of all, you\u2019ve been making a lot of adjustments to your life. You\u2019ve been transitioning, adapting to your new hormones and learning more about yourself and your sexuality.\n\nAs you\u2019ve become more comfortable with yourself, more confident in your identity and more aware of your needs, desires and sexual expression, you\u2019ve started to understand how much of what you understood about your sexuality might have been the product of your situation. That\u2019s not being inconsistent, that\u2019s dealing with the pains of becoming the person you are today.\n\nHowever, it also sounds like you and your partner may have incompatible sexual needs. Sexual compatibility goes beyond issues like matching sex drives. It also encompasses things like sexual roles and the kind of sex that you both would like to have.\n\nIf you and your partner are both subs, that\u2019s going to be a problem. You\u2019re going to end up with what Dr. Liz Powell calls \u201clesbian sheep syndrome,\u201d where both partners are standing around waiting for the other to make the first move. And if topping your partner is going to cause you dysphoria, then all that\u2019s going to do is lead to miserable sex at best and shutting down the sexual side of your relationship entirely at worst.\n\nWhile yes, couples should be what Official NerdLove Celebrity Patronus Dan Savage calls Good, Giving and Game \u2014 good in bed, giving of pleasure and game for most things within reason \u2014 doing things that leave you curled up and crying in the shower (metaphorically or literally) is well outside the call of duty for you as a partner.\n\nIn order to make this relationship work, the two of you will need to find ways to bridge this particular incompatibility, and that can be hard. While some folks can switch \u2014 top on occasion while mostly being a bottom \u2014 subs and tops really don\u2019t change their orientation.\n\nIf it\u2019s an issue of having confidence or becoming comfortable with taking charge, that\u2019s something you can work on. But if you\u2019re trying to go from being a sub to a switch or a top\u2026 well, that\u2019s a much bigger ask, and it\u2019s less likely to be something you can change. More often than not, it\u2019s just part of people\u2019s personalities.\n\nWhat I would suggest is that the two of you find a sex-positive couples therapist in your area; the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists has a referral directory that can help you find a therapist near you. A couples counsellor or sex therapist would be able to help the two of you find options that would work for you, whether it\u2019s getting comfortable with taking charge or finding other ways to bridge this gap.\n\nIt\u2019ll take work, but with luck, this will just be a road bump on the path to a happy and fulfilling relationship.\n\nGood luck.\n\nHey Doc, So I\u2019m pretty independent and normally wouldn\u2019t consider asking for help like this but I\u2019m so out of my depth with this problem that I kind of need an outside perspective from someone completely unbiased so, here goes. I\u2019m a young gay man and I am best friends with another gay man who\u2019s also a fairly religious Muslim. We\u2019ve known each other for a few years now and we have a connection that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had with anyone else before; he and I are so similar but just different enough to be complementary. We get into these arguments/discussions that\u2019ll go for hours about religion, spirituality, society, literally everything and anything. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone I respect more who\u2019s not family, and he\u2019s a genuinely good, moral person who isn\u2019t just unquestionably good but really considers what that means and tries his best. I really love him. Now the crux of the issue is that he is religiously and culturally a Muslim and he feels he can never be with me because of his family. He\u2019s very close to his mum in particular and he is convinced (rightly so) that if they should ever find out he\u2019ll either be shunned completely or they\u2019ll try to bring him to \u201ctherapy.\u201d Despite his connection to his family he\u2019s constantly fighting with them (his mother for the most part) because they want him living with them (he\u2019s a PhD student and travels the province looking for positions) and looking for a wife. He\u2019s always avoiding them and only visits just enough to see them and not fight. His plan is to never tell them until they die of old age (too many years to come) and until then to be \u201cmarried to his work.\u201d We really do feel strongly for each other and he\u2019s told me many times how much he\u2019d want us to be together but that he can\u2019t. He even went so far as to say that in another life he\u2019d marry me in a heartbeat. I don\u2019t want to lose him; he\u2019s convinced we can just stay friends but I\u2019m not so sure, we can barely be alone together when he visits. What can he or I do? He\u2019s too afraid of facing his family and being banished but I\u2019m worried he\u2019s just ruining his life for bigots. What\u2019s the point of family if they can\u2019t ever accept you for who you are and you\u2019re forced to live a lie? Let me know what you think, Mister Sadman\n\nSince I\u2019m presuming that your friend would say if it were the case otherwise, I\u2019m guessing that the consequences for his coming out to his parents would be emotional and social, rather than something that would put him in actual physical danger or would leave him in dire financial straits.\n\nWhile I agree with you that it\u2019s a tragedy that he\u2019s choosing to live a lie in order to appeal to bigots, it is understandable why he\u2019s afraid to come out to his folks.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely likely that he\u2019s got good reason to believe that his coming out would end with his being kicked out of the family, without hope of an eventual reconciliation. Losing that relationship can be legitimately traumatic and I can completely understand why he might want to try to avoid that\u2026 even if it meant that he wouldn\u2019t have to be living a lie.\n\nAt the same time, however, the idea that he\u2019s just going to stay closeted until his parents die is\u2026 well, not exactly practical. The stress of hiding this significant and important part of his life from his parents is the sort of thing that tends to cause issues, both in the short term and the long term.\n\nBut at the end of the day, that\u2019s his choice. As much as you may disagree with it, as much as you may think that it\u2019s a bad decision, he\u2019s the only person who can make that call.\n\nThe problem for the two of you is that his decision also affects you. His staying closeted means that he\u2019s going to be dragging you into that closet with him. If you two were to make things official and actually date, then as long as he stays closeted, then it means that neither of you can be honest about your relationship.\n\nThat means constantly having to monitor what you say on social media and never having cute photos of your vacations together on Instagram. It means never being able to celebrate the holidays together openly, having to avoid anything that smacks of intimacy or affection whenever you visit his family with him and lying constantly about the nature of your relationship.\n\nAnd even if you can manage this, it would mena dragging your family and your friends and his friends in with you, lest they accidentally spill the beans and trigger that blow up that he\u2019s desperately trying to avoid.\n\nIt\u2019d be less of a relationship and more like trying to be an undercover agent in East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall. How long could you and your social circle keep the charade up before someone cracked? How long do you think you could live like this? A year? 5 years? 20 years? 40?\n\nUltimately, you\u2019re at an impasse here. If he\u2019s unwilling or unable to come out, then I don\u2019t see any way this relationship could possibly work. All of the baggage that comes with dating someone who\u2019s closeted, even if it\u2019s for a good reason, is going to be a level of stress that most relationships just can\u2019t survive.\n\nNow you could call the question. You could make his coming out of the closet a condition of being in a romantic relationship with you\u2026 but then you have to live with the possibility that his fear of blowing up his relationship with his family is greater than his attraction to you.\n\nYou think he\u2019s ruining his life for no good reason. I agree with you. But at the end of the day, he\u2019s the only one who can make this call. You can\u2019t make it for him. So until he\u2019s willing to take that chance, I think the best thing you can do is try to be friends. And if you can\u2019t manage to just be friends? Then I think the best thing to do is give each other space until things change.\n\nBut keep in mind: I\u2019m a straight, cis guy. I don\u2019t have the same perspective that someone who has been closeted or dated someone who was closeted may have, so I strongly encourage the LGBTQ readers who have to share their experiences in the comments.\n\nGood luck.\n\nHarris O\u2019Malley is a writer and dating coach who provides geek dating advice at his blog Paging Dr. NerdLove and the Dr. NerdLove YouTube channel.
