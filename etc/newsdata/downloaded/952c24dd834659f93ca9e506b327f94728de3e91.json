REFILE-FOREX-Dollar weakens vs yen as U.S. economic worries, trade frictions intensify\n\n(Refiles to clarify analyst's location in paragraph 4)\n\n* Dollar touches fresh one-week low vs yen and euro\n\n* Moves slight amid equities sell-down\n\n* Pound rangebound as EU mulls Brexit offer\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n\n\nBy Tom Westbrook\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The dollar eased on Thursday,\n\nsliding to fresh one-week lows against the euro and yen as\n\ninvestor anxiety deepened over fresh signs of slowing U.S.\n\neconomic growth and a broadening of global trade frictions.\n\nThe greenback fell overnight after data showed hiring by\n\nU.S. private employers had cooled in September, the latest\n\nindicator that the Sino-U.S. trade dispute is hurting the\n\nworld's largest economy. It remained wobbly in Asian hours, while stocks tumbled as\n\ninvestors grappled with the deepening global economic gloom.\n\n\"Markets are beginning to look at the U.S. economy with a\n\nbit more concern,\" said Han Tan, a Kuala Lumpur-based market\n\nanalyst at brokerage FXTM.\n\n\"The fear now is that the manufacturing slowdown in the\n\nglobal economy is feeding back into the U.S. as well,\" he said.\n\n\"Bigger alarm bells would sound off if we started to see a\n\nbigger slowdown from U.S. consumers,\" Tan added, noting\n\ninvestors' attention would now turn to Friday's U.S. jobs data\n\nfor a fuller picture of the economy's health.\n\nThe dollar crossed 107 Japanese yen and touched a week low\n\nof 106.95 yen. It fell to $1.0964 per euro, though both moves\n\nwere less than a tenth of a percentage point.\n\nIt held close to a one-week low against the New Zealand\n\ndollar NZD=D3 at $0.6265 per kiwi and weakened a little\n\nagainst the beaten-up Australian dollar AUD=D3 to $0.6715.\n\nAdding to concerns, the United States won approval on\n\nWednesday to levy tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European\n\ngoods over illegal subsidies handed to Airbus, threatening to\n\ntrigger a transatlantic trade war.\n\nFutures pricing indicated a 73% chance that the U.S. Federal\n\nReserve will reduce benchmark interest rates to support the\n\neconomy at its next meeting later this month. FEDWATCH\n\nThat is up from about 60% a day earlier, but was not enough\n\nto drive a spirited flight from the dollar, which is also widely\n\nseen as a safety bet at times of economic or political\n\nuncertainty. The greenback held steady against a basket of\n\ncurrencies , just above 99 and not miles below the two\n\nyear high 99.667 it hit on Tuesday.\n\n\"It seems like there's been a bit of a seachange in market\n\nsentiment,\" said Nick Twidale co-founder of Sydney-based trade\n\nfinance provider Xchainge, though adding that the U.S. still\n\nlooked in better shape the Europe.\n\n\"I think overall (the dollar) will remain grinding higher\n\nwhile there's still a disparity between the U.S. economy and the\n\nrest of the world.\"\n\nThe next readings on global economic health will be European\n\nAugust retail sales and a German service sector survey due on\n\nThursday, and September's U.S. non-manufacturing ISM survey due\n\nat 1400 GMT.\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 was steady at $1.2304 after fluctuating\n\nin a tight range as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\n\nproposed an all-island regulatory zone in Ireland in his final\n\npitch for a Brexit deal before the end of the month.\n\nSterling's outlook, however, remained uncertain after a cool\n\nresponse to the proposal from Brussels, leaving a no-deal exit\n\nfrom the European Union on Oct. 31 a real possibility.\n\nIn offshore trade, the Chinese yuan CNH= ticked up\n\nslightly to 7.1368 per dollar, with trade subdued as Chinese\n\nmarkets are closed until Monday for public holidays.\n\n\n\n", "description": "REFILE-FOREX-Dollar weakens vs yen as U.S. economic worries, trade frictions intensify", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED9H01L_L.jpg"}
