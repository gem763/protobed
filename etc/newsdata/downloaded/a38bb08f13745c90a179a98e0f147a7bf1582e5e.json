The secretive DOJ investigation includes scrutiny of former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former FBI special agent Peter Strzok, and British ex-spy Christopher Steele. Durham has also sought interviews with many members of the CIA and FBI.\n\n\u201cAs you know, I\u2019ve said previously that I felt there was a failure of leadership at the bureau in 2016 and part of 2017, but since Director Wray and his team have taken over, there\u2019s been a world of change,\u201d Barr said. \u201cI think that he is restoring the steady professionalism that\u2019s been a hallmark of the FBI. I really appreciate his leadership there.\u201d\n\nThe controversial actions taken by FBI Director James Comey in 2016 and 2017 are being looked at by Durham and were a key focus of DOJ inspector general Michael Horowitz\u2019s lengthy investigation into possible abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act too. Horowitz\u2019s report is expected in the coming weeks.\n\nBarr\u2019s defense of Wray comes as some Republicans \u2014 including Trump \u2014 have criticized the bureau\u2019s director in recent months. Wray\u2019s apparent assistance in the investigation of the investigators could prove essential to Durham getting answers.\n\nDurham, whose portfolio recently expanded to include events from the launch of the investigation in 2015 or 2016 through the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller in 2017, has taken overseas fact-finding trips with Barr, who was given \u201cfull and complete authority to declassify information\u201d related to the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation in May. Barr selected Durham to run the investigation soon after.", "description": "Attorney General William Barr said Monday his right-hand man, U.S. Attorney John Durham, is making progress in his investigation into the Trump-Russia inquiry origins, with help from FBI Director Christopher Wray.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/83ea990/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2291x1203+0+60/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F07%2Fa6%2Fe030abfe450c9de312463c980fd5%2Fchristopher-wray.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
