He also stressed that \u201cAfghans lead these operations on the ground\u201d with U.S. troops present in an advisory role.\n\nSince the suspension of talks, Trump has asserted repeatedly that U.S. forces were striking the Taliban harder.\n\n\u201cThe last four days, we\u2019ve hit our enemy harder than they have ever been hit before, and that will continue,\u201d Trump said during a ceremony at the Pentagon marking the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. Trump repeated the claim the following week.\n\nBut the U.S. military headquarters responsible for operations in Afghanistan has not acknowledged any new instructions from Trump to launch more strikes and raids.\n\nEsper also said the Pentagon is still considering cutting its troop levels in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cMy ambition would be to get the troop level down to a level by which we know we can contain and do the core mission,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe Pentagon describes counterterrorism operations against terrorist groups al-Qaida and the Islamic State\u2019s Afghan affiliate as its core mission in the country. That's as opposed to the broader mission of helping the Afghan government fend off the Taliban insurgency.\n\n\u201cIf a commander feels confident that he can reduce forces, I will look at the right timing to do that, whether it\u2019s there, whether it\u2019s Africa, you name it, to make sure I can get down to a more manageable level,\u201d he added.\n\nGen. Austin Miller, the top commander in Afghanistan, has already trimmed troop levels from the official total of 14,000 to closer to 13,000, POLITICO reported in August.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/52/b0/98f820954d15adf3724690288f72/191004-esper-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
