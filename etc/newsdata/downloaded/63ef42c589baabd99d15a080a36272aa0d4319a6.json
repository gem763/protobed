He spent time under observation at Llandough Hospital before being released.\n\nThe inquest heard that Mr Crofts, who was born in Wrexham, started a relationship with Jessica Beard in 2017 and the pair got engaged in June 2018.\n\nIn a statement read to the court, Ms Beard, who was pregnant with their second child at the time of her fiance's death, said: \"He desperately wanted to be sectioned due to voices telling him to kill himself.\"\n\nHis family said that shortly after discovering Ms Beard was expecting their second child he asked to be sectioned again.\n\nOn January 7, 2019 the couple went to Barry Hospital, where Mr Crofts was seen by an occupational therapist.\n\nMr Crofts asked to be prescribed medication but as no doctor was available to see him, that was not possible.\n\n(Image: Family Handout)\n\nAn appointment was scheduled for January 9, where Mr Crofts spent around an hour with qualified GP and psychiatrist Dr Alison McLain.\n\nDuring the appointment he was prescribed three medications to help deal with depression, anxiety and psychotic symptoms.\n\nThe next day Mr Crofts told his partner he was going for a drive \u201cto clear his head\u201d at around 10pm. Ms Beard later became concerned after he was not responding to her text messages.\n\nShe tracked his location via his mobile phone to a car park in the Vale of Glamorgan.\n\nMs Beard found his vehicle but there was no sign of her fiance.\n\nShe later called South Wales Police and officers found Mr Croft\u2019s body nearby. Mr Crofts was pronounced dead at around 1.20am on January 11.\n\nA post-mortem report found no contributing levels of drugs or alcohol in Mr Crofts system, and his medical cause of death was recorded as hanging.\n\nThe inquest heard evidence from occupational therapist Sarah Ames who saw Mr Crofts on January 7.\n\nMs Ames said: \u201cHe was a bit confused. He was insightful to know he was unwell. He wanted to start some anti-psychotic medication.\u201d\n\nFollowing his request, Ms Ames spoke with Dr McLain who said as she was unable to see Mr Crofts in person and could not prescribe medication. The appointment was however made.\n\nWhen asked how Mr Crofts reacted to the decision, Ms Ames said: \u201cI think he was pleased. I would imagine he would have liked to have had something sooner - but he was accepting of that plan.\"\n\nMs Ames added that Mr Crofts did not appear to be \u201cupset or distressed\u201d, and did not warrant the involvement of the Crisis Team which deal with patients deemed to be at a greater risk.\n\nDuring his appointment with Dr McLain on January 9, the inquest heard he described himself as \u201cworried and possessed\u201d.\n\nDr McLain told the inquest: \"I do not recall anything remarkable about his presentation.\n\n\"He was quite able and ready to tell his story, and he was well supported by his partner.\u201d\n\nShe added: \"I absolutely thought he did not want to harm himself and I still believe that.\n\n\"He said he wanted to get better, he had a lot to live for. He recognised he was ill. He knew he needed treatment.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he appeared to be a danger to himself, Dr McLain replied \"no\".\n\nDr McLain said she did not directly recall Mr Crofts asking to be admitted to hospital.\n\n(Image: Rob Browne)\n\nCoroner Graeme Hughes said: \"Having heard evidence from Sarah Ames I am satisfied he [Mr Crofts] was appropriately assessed in terms of his treatment and medication.\n\n\"I accept the evidence of Ms Ames and Dr McLain that it would have not been appropriate to prescribe anti-psychotic medication without assessment.\"\n\nMr Hughes added Mr Crofts was \"properly\" assessed on January 9 and that there was no \"clear\" risk of self-harm.\n\nHe said: \"I do not find the involvement of the mental health services approximate to January 10 caused or contributed to his death.\"\n\nSpeaking after the inquest Mr Crofts mother Andrea Prevett described her son as \"loving, funny and cheeky\".\n\nMs Prevett said: \"Dai was a happy child, a caring and proud man and an incredibly dedicated father to Harrison.\n\n\"He loved the outdoors and his family, and wanted nothing more than to support and provide for them.\n\n\"His death means his children will never benefit from his love and care, and we all experience this loss profoundly.\"\n\nFor confidential support the Samaritans can be contacted for free around the clock 365 days a year on 116 123.", "description": "Dai Crofts, 24, was tragically found dead in January days after he had pleaded to be hospitalised following psychotic episodes", "authors": ["Thomas Deacon", "Image", "Family Handout", "Rob Browne"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20533450.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Dai-Croft.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
