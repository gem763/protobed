They must understand that they are creating a legacy by coming to Manchester United. Nobody is bigger than the club.\n\nThe Norwegian had come under pressure after United's worst start to a season for 30 years\n\n'There should be both a humbleness and an arrogance. Humble when you are on the team coach and you wear the club suit, you do up your top button and wear your tie, you represent the club in the right way. Then you sign autographs for the people who pay your wages.\n\n'Then, when you go into the dressing room, you put the red shirt on and you feel arrogant, self assured. As Michael Carrick said in his book, you want to take the ball, you want the ball in tight spaces, you want a never-say-die spirit. Ole has brought a lot of the discipline back.\n\n'Whatever manager we have has to buy into that philosophy and Ole is a walking, talking version of that. Let's let this play out with Ole in terms of the culture reboot.'\n\nBut Woodward believes Solskjaer to be a 'walking, talking' version of United's philosophy\n\nThe under-fire executive vice chairman accepted that pressure was also mounting on him to steer the club to success, with United having spent \u00a3900million on transfers since his promotion and failed to challenge for the title again.\n\nHe added: 'I understand the scrutiny; it's part of the job.\n\n'We have to do everything that we possibly can to get back to winning the Premier League. We are not successful until we do. Second is not success, we have to win the Premier League.'\n\n'I feel that we are on the right track to get back to that point but we are going to have to be patient.'", "description": "Despite reports stating that the manager could be axed if United were to lose against Liverpool, the United chief believes Solskjaer remains the man to oversee the club's revival.", "authors": ["Daniel Davis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/12/19953662-0-image-a-3_1571570687353.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
