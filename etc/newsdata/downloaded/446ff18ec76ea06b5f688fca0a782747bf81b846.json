Long4Life\u2019s investments in infrastructure and store development impacted both margins and returns in the short term, it said.\n\nIts sport and recreation division \u2013 which includes Sportsmans Warehouse and Outdoor Warehouse \u2013 saw its revenue increase by almost 13% to R1bn. Product prices at these stores rose by 1.1% - almost double the price inflation in the previous year (0.6%) - but its profit margin was lower due to promotions and sales.\n\nLong4Life says Sorbet traded in line with expectations, but while interest from potential franchisees remains strong, \u201cassessing and securing suitable sites for franchisees remain a challenge\u201d.\n\nIts beverage division (Chill Beverages and Inhle Beverages), which produces its own brands and private label products, saw revenue increased by 20% to R657m.\n\nOver recent months, Long4Life increased its stake in Spur to 14.4%, and it also spent more than R109.1 million on buying back its own shares. Long4Life is considering acquisitions \u201cin a diligent and cautious manner\u201d.\n\nNo dividend was declared.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Its share price jumped on Monday despite the company reporting slightly lower profits.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9005/0777ec71833546b78928fb99b0b46e33.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
