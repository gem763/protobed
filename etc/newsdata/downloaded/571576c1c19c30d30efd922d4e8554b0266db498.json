Throughout the collection, Benson draws clear parallels between the events of Greek mythology and our own contemporary political moment: \u201cI kept the dictaphone running / it recorded nothing / but my own voice / vulcanised and screaming / you won\u2019t get away with this.\u201d\n\nVertigo & Ghost by Fiona Benson review \u2013 songs of shock and survival Read more\n\nShahidha Bari, the chair of the judges, called it \u201ca work of unfaltering determination and self-inspection. It is an exhilarating collection that pulses with fury, fear and defiance \u2013 and enduring hope too.\u201d\n\nBenson, who spent a decade crafting her debut collection Bright Travellers, said in an interview with the Forward Arts Foundation that the poems of Vertigo & Ghost \u201ccame in what felt like an involuntary rush, and sometimes in the case of the Zeus poems, I felt I didn\u2019t want them, or couldn\u2019t keep up \u2026 There was no plan.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Benson has been singled out for the Forward prizes. She was shortlisted for the best single poem category in 2018 for Ruin, as well as the best first collection category for Bright Travellers in 2015. Earlier this week, it was announced that Vertigo & Ghost has also been shortlisted for the TS Eliot prize for poetry.\n\nAlongside Vertigo & Ghost, Stephen Sexton\u2019s If All the World and Love Were Young won the \u00a35,000 Felix Dennis prize for best first collection, with his moving exploration of how video games shaped his grief over his mother\u2019s death.\n\nSexton, stating that he found the idea of writing a book about Super Mario \u201cmildly absurd, and utterly compelling\u201d, soon discovered that his memories of childhood were inextricably linked to grief. He said: \u201cI discovered I was actually writing an elegy for my mother, which came as a surprise to me. In terms of genre, it\u2019s a pastoral elegy, and the digital landscapes of Mario\u2019s world are put beside the actual landscapes of our world.\u201d\n\nThe Afghani poet Parwana Fayyaz also walked away with the prize for best single poem for Forty Names, which depicts the experience of 40 women who jump off of a cliff in order to preserve their \u201chonour\u201d. Fayyaz only began to write poetry in 2010, when she learned English as a second language.\n\nBari called Forty Names \u201ca poem that feels close to a prayer, and yet is shocking and vital.\u201d She said: \u201cIt startled us with its simple, invocatory power, and reminded us of the profound act of witness that poetry can be.\u201d\n\nCollectively, the five-strong judging panel \u2013 made up of the poets Tara Bergin, Andrew McMillan and Carol Rumens, as well as Bari and the British Library\u2019s Jamie Andrews \u2013 read 204 collections and 183 single poems before coming to their final decisions.\n\nBari said they were all \u201cimmensely proud of the winners\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cThese are poets who inspired us with their conviction and impressed us with their fearlessness. They remind us of what poetry can feel like at its very best: politically urgent and emotionally resonant.\u201d\n\nPast winners of the Forward prizes include three of the UK\u2019s poet laureates \u2013 Ted Hughes, Carol Ann Duffy and Simon Armitage \u2013 as well as Kathleen Jamie and Seamus Heaney.\n\nBenson, Fayyaz and Sexton collected their awards at a ceremony in London\u2019s Southbank Centre on Sunday night.", "description": "Poems on grieving through Super Mario, \u2018honour\u2019 killings and sexual violence claim top awards", "authors": ["Emily Hay"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e613f1befe2ec7477d4c0184f6a1788be38e390/0_28_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=374f42968762c47a1084492206c9b059", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
