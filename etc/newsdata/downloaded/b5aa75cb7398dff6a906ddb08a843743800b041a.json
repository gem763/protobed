If students are not wearing the correct uniform they will be asked to return home and change into the correct uniform before entering the school.\u201d\n\nParents have described the school\u2019s position as \u201cpointless and silly\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is grossly unfair to have withdrawn a girl\u2019s right to express themselves in a skirt,\u201d said one protesting parent to the Brighton Argus.\n\nThe paper, which liveblogged the protest, also spoke to parent Sheila Cullen, 57, who said: \u201cThis school is obsessed with the length of skirts \u2013 it always has been.\n\n\u201cThis new uniform police disproportionately affects girls as they\u2019re the ones who have to buy the new uniform.
