Warren Davidson said that Facebook should consider adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its Calibra wallet, instead of creating its new currency Libra. The Republican added that part of the beauty of Facebook\u2019s Libra stablecoin is that brought all of the problems that already existed on the social media platform to the surface.\n\nHe said that Facebook\u2019s bid to launch its stablecoin had served to intensify focus on many of the platform\u2019s existing operations, arguing that:", "description": "RBC analysts believe that China\u2019s digital currency might become the dominant digital currency if U.S. regulators dismiss Facebook's Libra coin", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8zNDAyNjE5ZDgwZDI0ZWZlZTJiZmU4YzA5OGIxYTA0OS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
