You're entitled to do that,\" said Kovac, who endured a crisis of four competitive games without a win around the same time last season.\n\nBayern's 15 points is the team's worst mark at this stage since Louis van Gaal was in charge in 2010. The Dutch coach, whose side had 11 points at the time, was fired the following April.\n\nKovac doesn't enjoy the unflinching support of Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, but he has been backed for now by sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic.\n\n\"We're all pulling in the same direction,\" Salihamidzic said.\n\nCoutinho and M\u00fcller, his substitute on Saturday, missed good chances to put Bayern up 3-1 before Alfred Finnbogason equalized for Augsburg in injury time. It was the sixth consecutive game in which Kovac started with Coutinho instead of M\u00fcller.\n\n\"We live in a competitive society,\" Kovac said.\n\nThis time last year, Rummenigge and club president Uli Hoene\u00df attacked the media for \"derogatory, slanderous reporting\" and threatened to take legal action if unfavorable coverage of the team's struggles continued.\n\nKovac managed to turn the side's fortunes around and eventually led it to a record-extending seventh straight Bundesliga title, as well as a German Cup victory in Berlin.\n\nThis year, Kovac has been charged with doing better in the Champions League, where his side has already delivered a statement with a 7-2 rout of Tottenham. Bayern next visits Olympiakos on Wednesday, then it returns to Bundesliga action against visiting Union Berlin on Saturday.\n\nDespite its lackluster start, Bayern is just behind leader Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach at the top of the Bundesliga.\n\n\"We're one point behind first place. Do you want to talk us into a crisis?\" Hoene\u00df said on Monday. \"I'm satisfied with everything but our goal tally.\"\n\nLEIPZIG STRUGGLING\n\nLeipzig, which had ambitions of challenging Bayern for the league title this season, is also struggling.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann's side has not won any of its last four competitive games, leading to criticism from chairman Oliver Mintzlaff after Saturday's 1-1 draw with Wolfsburg.\n\n\"It feels like a defeat. Five points from the last four home games is too little, two points from the last two Bundesliga games, too. We can do better,\" Mintzlaff said.\n\nLeipzig next hosts Zenit St. Petersburg in the Champions League on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nCiar\u00e1n Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
