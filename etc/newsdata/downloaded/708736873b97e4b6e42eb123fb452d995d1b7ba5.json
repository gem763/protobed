On her brooding, expansive sixth album, Norman F-cking Rockwell, she digs even further into the image she\u2019s crafted for herself as a tortured creative soul still in thrall to romance. Del Rey has always made sure to seamlessly mix the fictional with the factual; it\u2019s hard to say where her persona begins and ends, as we discovered after her surprise viral hit \u201cVideo Games\u201d launched her to stardom in 2011. That enduring mystery \u2014 and her tendency to blend historic references with contemporary context \u2014 gives her lyrics extra weight as she builds a narrative of nihilistic American stardom, all set to sepia-toned imagery.\n\nHere\u2019s our analysis of every song on Norman F\u2014ing Rockwell, from the tender love ballad \u201cLove song\u201d to her Sublime cover \u201cDoin\u2019 Time\u201d to her ode to her home state \u201cCalifornia.\u201d\n\n1. \u201cNorman F\u2014ing Rockwell\u201d\n\nThe first strains of \u201cNorman F-cking Rockwell\u201d are pretty strings; it sounds like the beginning of a Golden Age movie, or a ballet overture. Then the piano comes in, warm and unapologetic, with enthusiasm that feels like a Billy Joel tune. And then there\u2019s Del Rey: \u201cGoddamn, man-child,\u201d she lilts. \u201cYour poetry\u2019s bad and you blame the news.\u201d The title emphatically references the artist and author Rockwell, who was famous for illustrating quotidian scenes of mid-20th-century American life with a political conscience. But Del Rey seems less thrilled about her paramour\u2019s art \u2014 although, in typical fashion, she seems to find joy in eviscerating the object of her complaints.\n\n2. \u201cMariners Apartment Complex\u201d\n\nReleased back in September 2018 as an early single, \u201cMariners Apartment Complex\u201d sees Del Rey go folk. (She\u2019s described the album to Billboard as \u201ca folk record with a little surf twist,\u201d which rings true now that it\u2019s out.) Her breathiness is on full display, as is her confidence; \u201cI ain\u2019t no candle in the wind\u201d suggests she\u2019s not going anywhere. \u201cYou lose your way, just take my hand,\u201d she insists. \u201cYou\u2019re lost at sea, then I\u2019ll command your boat to me again\u2026 I\u2019m your man.\u201d It\u2019s a statement of purpose that sees Del Rey establish herself as much more than the lost ingenue character she previously inhabited in albums like Born to Die and Ultraviolence.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

But there\u2019s a dark side: \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful and I\u2019m insane, we\u2019re American made,\u201d she shares, and the song eventually devolves into a muddy, distorted-guitar-and-synth reverie for the rest of its 10-minute run. The psychedelia comes into focus with her bridge, where she repeats \u201ccrimson and clover\u201d over and over, the title of a 1968 song from Tommy James and the Shondells.\n\n4. \u201cF-ck it I love you\u201d\n\nDreamy and languid, \u201cF-ck it I love you\u201d sees Del Rey in full reminiscence mode: \u201cI moved to California but it\u2019s just a state of mind / Turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that\u2019s not a lie,\u201d she recites in a rapid sing-song. (Del Rey moved from New York to Los Angeles in 2012.) She seems torn between two extremes \u2014 \u201cMaybe the way I\u2019m living is killing me\u2026 one day I woke up like, \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll do it differently'\u201d could potentially be a reference to her history with alcohol: she\u2019s discussed being sent to boarding school at 14 partially to get sober, and subsequently going to rehab. \u201cIt\u2019s been nine years since my last drink,\u201d she told GQ back in 2012. \u201cI would drink every day. I would drink alone.\u201d But the song is also about being muddled in love. When she sings \u201cDream a little dream of me,\u201d it\u2019s both a throwback to the 1931 pop standard tune and a plea for attention.\n\n5. \u201cDoin\u2019 Time\u201d\n\nA whole generation may grow up with Del Rey\u2019s version of \u201cDoin\u2019 Time\u201d as their classic. Her cover of the 1996 Sublime song (which samples Gershwin\u2019s 1930s \u201cSummertime\u201d) is breezy and swinging, turning the track into an atmospheric, bossa-nova-inflected mood. She sticks to the original lyrics, name-checking Sublime singer Bradley Nowell, and drummer Marshall \u201cRas MG\u201d Goodman, and maintaining the gendered pronouns in the bridge about an \u201cevil\u201d girlfriend. That commitment adds new twists to the otherwise straightforward storytelling of \u201cDoin\u2019 Time,\u201d inserting Del Rey into the song\u2019s layered history.\n\n6. \u201cLove song\u201d\n\nOn \u201cLove Song,\u201d Del Rey leans into sincerity. The song is exactly as the title tells it: a tender, intimate love ballad. The only visuals she draws are of a car: \u201cIn the backseat, I\u2019m your baby / we go fast, we go so fast we don\u2019t move\u2026 so spill my clothes on the floor of your new car.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s doubled down on auto iconography (\u201cBorn to Die,\u201d anyone?) but now there\u2019s a sweetness instead of a recklessness in her attitude. \u201cIs it safe to just be who we are?\u201d she wonders over a minimal piano and strings background. Del Rey has subdued her rebel side in favor of partnership.\n\n7. \u201cCinnamon Girl\u201d\n\nA slow march of a song, \u201cCinnamon Girl\u201d details a conflicted relationship. \u201cIf you hold me without hurting me, you\u2019ll be the first who ever did,\u201d she sings, her voice an angelic falsetto even as she describes emotional devastation. As for the title and first line about \u201ccinnamon in my teeth\u201d? Cinnamon also featured in 2012\u2019s \u201cRadio,\u201d \u2014 \u201cNow my life is sweet like cinnamon / like a f-cking dream I\u2019m living in\u201d \u2014 suggesting the kind of complex, wild-ride romances she\u2019s know for writing about.\n\n8. \u201cHow to disappear\u201d\n\nSlow-burning but with a jazzy kick, \u201cHow to disappear\u201d spins a tale of Del Rey\u2019s love for a man \u2014 named, in this instance, Joe \u2014 that also serves as a commentary on traditional American masculinity. (\u201cCuts on his face cause he fought too hard\u2026 I watched the guys getting high as they fight for the things that they hold dear / to forget the the things they fear,\u201d she observes.) Del Rey envisions a fictional, familial future for herself \u201cI\u2019ve got a kid and two cats in the yard / The California sun and the movie stars\u2026\u201d) with Joe, but the song really contemplates the slippery nature of a relationship she clings to.\n\n9. \u201cCalifornia\u201d\n\n\u201cCalifornia\u201d doubles down on Del Rey\u2019s fixation on the state (see: her mention of the \u201cSanta Ana,\u201d famously strong winds that whip through California). It also sees her calling in a reference to Joni Mitchell and her 1971 song \u201cCalifornia,\u201d which seems to serve as a direct inspiration. In that song, Mitchell sings of traveling around Europe \u2014 and \u201cthen I\u2019m coming home to California\u2026 will you take me as I am, strung out on another man?\u201d In her version, Del Rey has an answer: \u201cIf you come back to California, you should just hit me up / we\u2019ll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far.\u201d Mitchell mentions reading Rolling Stone and Vogue magazines; Del Rey promises \u201cI\u2019ll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones.\u201d It\u2019s a conversation stretched out over the decades, one asking a question about the hospitality of the Golden State, the other answering graciously.\n\n10. \u201cThe Next Best American Record\u201d\n\nOnce more, Del Rey draws from the history of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. This time it\u2019s Led Zeppelin and their 1973 album Houses of the Holy to start, as well as the band the Eagles in the trap-lite chorus, while she goes on to sing about the process of trying to write the \u201cnext best American record\u201d with her lover. \u201cHe was cool as heck,\u201d she insists twice in the first verse \u2014 high praise from Del Rey. \u201cThe Next Best American Record\u201d has some of the most straightforward pop production on the album, particularly in her catchy chorus. But her melancholy lyricism remains, making this a sequel of sorts to previous hit \u201cSummertime Sadness\u201d in its mixed emotions.\n\n11. \u201cThe greatest\u201d\n\nOne of the most directly nostalgic of Del Rey\u2019s songs on Norman F\u2014ing Rockwell, \u201cThe greatest\u201d sees her looking back on recent history \u2014 both musical and political \u2014 as she bemoans the present. There\u2019s a nod to Dennis Wilson, ill-fated drummer for the Beach Boys, and the paradise island of \u201cKokomo.\u201d There\u2019s a line about missing New York and its music scene, where she started, and the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll of an earlier era. There\u2019s a mention of a 2018 missile scare in Hawaii, of changing weather in L.A., of Kanye West\u2019s evolution from rapper to lightning rod of controversy, of the dire straits of the planet (\u201c\u2018Life on Mars\u2018 ain\u2019t just a song\u201d). And then there\u2019s her most millennial line yet: \u201cThe culture is lit, and if this is it, I had a ball / I guess that I\u2019m burned out after all.\u201d Her play on words turns the phrase on its head, skewering the youthful slang term \u201clit\u201d and leaning into the nihilistic burnout instead.\n\n12. \u201cBartender\u201d\n\nOn \u201cBartender,\u201d Del Rey kicks things off with a likely second Joni Mitchell reference: Mitchell\u2019s 1970 album was called Ladies of the Canyon, itself a reference to women who live in L.A.\u2019s famously creative Laurel Canyon area. Del Rey also name-checks Crosby, Stills and Nash, adding them to her long list of famous musicians she\u2019s included in her music. Then there\u2019s \u201cSometimes, girls just want to have fun\u201d \u2014 which sounds a lot like \u201cGirls Just Want to Have Fun\u201d from Cyndi Lauper. And \u201cthe poetry inside of me is warm like a gun\u201d feels like a call-out to the Beatles\u2019 \u201cHappiness Is a Warm Gun.\u201d All of these mentions weave together to form an idealized vision of her L.A., filled with ladies meditating in gardens and her incognito drives down the Pacific Coast Highway in a truck to see a bartender (\u201cphoto-free exits from baby\u2019s bedside\u201d) \u2014 although, as she notes, she\u2019s only drinking Cherry Coke. (Recall that Del Rey has discussed her sobriety before.) \u201cBartender\u201d deftly mixes the mythology of L.A.\u2019s past with its present, positioning Del Rey\u2019s struggle to keep love alive in the midst of contemporary fame as one more chapter in the story of Laurel Canyon artistry.\n\n13. \u201cHappiness is a butterfly\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s a serial killer, then what\u2019s the worst / That could happen to a girl who\u2019s already hurt? I\u2019m already hurt,\u201d Del Rey muses darkly on \u201cHappiness is a butterfly.\u201d It\u2019s a powerfully sad line: a suggestion that she\u2019s already hit rock bottom. In its title construction, \u201cHappiness is a butterfly\u201d echoes the Beatles\u2019s \u201cHappiness Is a Warm Gun,\u201d and this song is equally morose, melodic and surprising. Del Rey alludes to a relationship in flux: \u201cDo you want me or do you not?\u201d she wonders, name-checking Hollywood and Vine and \u201cLaurel down to Sunset\u201d \u2014 all L.A. streets \u2014 as she outlines the drama of their crumbling affair, her energy ramping up into a chorus that also works as an admonishment: \u201cI said, don\u2019t be a jerk, don\u2019t call me a taxi!\u201d In the end, Del Rey seems to say, love is fleeting and \u2014 like a butterfly \u2014 hard to capture; might as well take what she can get.\n\n14. \u201chope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have \u2013 but I have it\u201d\n\nThe album closer\u2019s dirge-like, spare intimacy make it one of her most loaded songs on the album; producer Jack Antonoff shared that it was recorded on the first day they worked together, and it retains that immediacy. Over just a piano, Del Rey sings in lyrics that are oblique but specific, each noun a weighted term. First, there\u2019s Slim Aarons, the famously chic mid-20th century American photographer of poolside scenes, whose aesthetic has become a mainstay of Instagram style. (Del Rey seems to feel that she\u2019s not quite the model.) Then there\u2019s Sylvia Path, feminist poet and author of The Bell Jar, who later committed suicide; Del Rey calls herself a \u201c24/7 Sylvia Plath,\u201d out on the town in a nightgown and \u201cwriting in blood on my walls\u201d \u2014 a bold visual of the tortured artist experience. She calls out time spent with \u201cBowery Bums,\u201d a name for residents of New York\u2019s skid row, who gave her the \u201conly love I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d But all this darkness is balanced out by the song\u2019s titular suggestion, which takes itself from a Morgan Freeman quote in The Shawshank Redemption. Del Rey may be no stranger to struggles, but she maintains hope.\n\nWrite to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com.", "description": "We explain the lyrics on every song off of Lana Del Rey's sixth album, 'Norman F-cking Rockwell' from 'Love song' to 'Doin' Time.'", "authors": ["Raisa Bruner"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/lana-del-rey.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1"}
