Yes, I link to the video. Yes, you will cry.\n\nThe US is just a tad ahead of us on BiP, having just wrapped up its sixth season. During the finale, filmed in Mexico, Demi Burnett proposed to Kristian Haggerty.\n\nIf you\u2019re not too familiar with The Bachelor US, Demi appeared in Colton Underwood\u2018s season of The Bachelor. She initially had a bit of a thing in Paradise with fellow contestant, Derek Peth, but Demi knew her feelings for Kristian \u2013 who she had dated for months prior to filming \u2013 were real. So the Bachie producers flew Kristian out to Mexico, just like that. She had never been on any Bachie show before.\n\n\u201cI know that this has been really hard. I\u2019ve put you through struggles and you are always there for me regardless of how much I didn\u2019t deserve it at the time,\u201d she told Kristian at their final commitment ceremony. \u201cI never knew someone could be that patient and there was a lot of things that came between us, mostly myself and my own struggles.\n\n\u201cLike you said I came here to find myself but I found myself in you.\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m sobbing at my desk.\n\nEarlier in the season, when Demi first came out as sexually fluid, GLAAD praised her and the show.\n\nSpoiler alert: I\u2019m a queer queen ???????????????? #BachelorInParadise \u2014 Demi Burnett (@demi_burnett) July 23, 2019\n\n\u201cTens of millions of people around the world watch The Bachelor and The Bachelorette franchises and this move to include a same-sex relationship in an honest fashion has the power to upend preconceived notions of LGBTQ people like Demi who are attracted to more than one gender,\u201d GLAAD tweeted.\n\nThe stunning couple have since taken to Instagram to celebrate their love and the pictures, they melt me.\n\nLast year, two contestants on The Bachelor Vietnam sent the internet absolutely wild when they left the show to be with each other. Minh Thu threw one heck of a spectacular spanner in the works during a rose ceremony when she confessed her love for fellow contestant Truc Nhu and told her to \u201ccome home with me.\u201d\n\nAs for our version of the franchise, Matt will make his choice between Abbie or Chelsie tonight.\n\nThe Bachelor finale airs 7.30pm on Channel 10.", "description": "The American Bachelor in Paradise\u00a0has celebrated the\u00a0franchise's first same-sex proposal.
