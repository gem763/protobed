This constitutes 8% of the total referrals received during this three-month period,\u201d he said.\n\nThe caseload, Morajane said, was projected to increase by 25% in the current financial year because more beneficiaries are becoming aware of the new pieces of legislations, especially the NMWA and the BCEA.\n\nMorajane said the commission managed to ensure 88 of all reconcilable cases were heard within the statutory time frame of 30 days, with the CCMA taking about 24 days to complete the entire conciliation process.\n\nHe said the commission dealt with 5 160 mutual interest disputes, a 10% increase compared with the previous financial year and dealt with 187 public interest matters, of which it managed to resolve 160 cases.\n\n\u201cThese figures suggest a high level of labour market trust and reliance on the CCMA to facilitate collective bargaining disputes,\u201d Morajane said.\n\nHe said that through the commission\u2019s dispute management and prevention outreach services, almost 70 000 people were taught to better understand the law and their rights.", "description": "The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) has had to deal with a record number of cases in the past year, driven largely by a volatile economy.", "authors": ["Lesetja Malope"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4454/7c3b9e2bee054834a5f49b8f9bdf5cd5.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
