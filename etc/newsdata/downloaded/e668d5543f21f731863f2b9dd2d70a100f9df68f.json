Photo-Illustration: James Gallagher\n\nThis week, a newly single woman in L.A. wonders if her future husband is anywhere to be found: 28, talent agent, straight, Los Angeles, single.\n\n\n\nDAY ONE\n\n8:00 a.m. I wake up and my body is buzzing with anxiety. My roommate and I must have drunk half a bottle of wine each last night watching dumb reality TV. I\u2019ve been pretty good about my drinking lately \u2014 I try to stay away from it during the week, because it jump-starts my mental health struggles. But ever since I was massively dumped last week, I\u2019m looking for anything to get me out of my own head. So far, wine has helped. But not this morning.\n\n9:00 a.m. I get to work, though I still feel like my head is not quite attached to my body.\n\nSo, the breakup. I met him two years ago at a bar. He was gorgeous, and smart, and interesting, but there was always one problem or another. It was the kind of relationship where you\u2019re constantly going down a rabbit hole of \u201cwho did what\u201d and \u201cwho\u2019s fault is it?\u201d At the end of the day, he called it.\n\n1:00 p.m. Bored at my desk, I start a dumb Instagram flirtation. Someone liked a picture of me, so I started liking all of their photos.\n\n\n\nI work as an assistant at a talent agency in LA. It feels unbearable sometimes spending the majority of my life tethered to a desk, getting lunch for wealthy men. I want more than anything to work for myself, to write and to be an artist. That\u2019s why I came out here, but it seems that the only way to afford being here in the first place is to have a full-time job. Unfortunately, after I\u2019ve spent nine hours sitting on my ass watching life happen to everyone else, I don\u2019t have a lot of time and energy left over to do anything that I actually want to do.\n\n3:00 p.m. The Instagram guy wants to make plans to meet tonight but I\u2019m not sure. He seems cute but I\u2019ve never met anyone from Instagram before. Also I\u2019m afraid I will burst into tears sitting across from anyone who\u2019s not my ex.\n\nSince I got dumped, I\u2019ve started to feel like dating is musical chairs and I\u2019m the last one standing. When I feel happy and secure, I\u2019m not even sure I want to get married. But lately I\u2019m not happy, so I\u2019m consumed with finding a cure. In the end, I just want to feel safe and secure.\n\n4:00 p.m. I ask my friends if I should meet Instagram guy, and decide to go for it. I text him to meet me. He\u2019s sweet and receptive. Maybe he\u2019ll be my husband!\n\n9:00 p.m. He\u2019s cute! Easy, meandering conversation. He has a dog. We don\u2019t touch at all.\n\n11:00 p.m. We finish our second drink each. I\u2019m giggling too much. It\u2019s time to leave.\n\n11:30 p.m. He drives me home. We hug. I go to sleep with renewed hope.\n\nDAY TWO\n\n\n\n8:00 a.m. I wake up feeling like the world is upside down again. At least today I have therapy.\n\n9:00 a.m. Work is another source of stress lately, mostly because I\u2019m working in a new department.\n\n5:45 p.m. I duck out a little early.\n\n7:00 p.m. Finished with therapy. It felt great, but I leave with the familiar disappointment of not being fixed.\n\n10:00 p.m. I\u2019m seeing an old friend who always makes me wonder about what could have been. He\u2019s everything anyone could ever want. I know if and when he marries someone who is not me, she will be the luckiest woman in the world and his kids will have the best dad, and I will probably die choking on a Teddy Graham alone. I arrive and order two drinks.\n\n11:00 p.m. He walks in and he\u2019s cuter and taller than I remember. I\u2019m so happy to see him. Maybe he\u2019s my husband!\n\n11:45 p.m. I am crying as I tell him that I\u2019m not in a good place. I feel like a late-20s clich\u00e9.\n\n12:10 p.m. We hug good-bye very intensely, like he\u2019s leaving for war.\n\n12:15 p.m. Before I take off, the bartender, who happens to look like Post Malone, asks if I\u2019m okay. I almost laugh at how crazy I must have looked. I leave thinking maybe the bartender is my husband?\n\nDAY THREE\n\n11:00 a.m. I make plans to meet A for drinks. He used to be my boss at another job, and we would spend lots of time together but I never knew if it was romantic. Plus I was in a relationship. Now we don\u2019t work together, and I\u2019m single, so \u2026\n\n8:00 p.m. I grab a Lyft to meet him near his place. I\u2019m not sure what I will feel, or if I want to go. But I know I have to keep moving, and A is a familiar face at least.\n\n9:00 p.m. I see A at the bar. Tight black T-shirt. It\u2019s on.\n\n10:00 p.m. Two wines deep, I boldly ask if this is a thing, me and him. He says it is and has been. Cool, noted. Check, please?\n\n11:00 p.m. We go back to his place. It\u2019s a concrete block of an apartment. L.A. wasteland chic.\n\n11:15 p.m. He asks if I\u2019ve seen American Dad. I haven\u2019t. He turns it on and we immediately start making out.\n\n12:00 a.m. For the next two to three hours, he\u2019s diving head-first into my pants. It\u2019s hot.\n\n2:00 a.m. He has no real furniture, so I sit on his one leather chair while he squats, legs straddled for balance, fingering me like he\u2019s digging for gold. I\u2019m trying to manipulate his arm and hand so this doesn\u2019t feel so \u2026 forceful? I\u2019m suddenly worried for my IUD.\n\n2:01 a.m. I say, \u201cYou\u2019re going to rip out my IUD.\u201d He relents a little, and I come. Not hard, but enough to know the job\u2019s done.\n\n2:30 a.m. I\u2019m so tired, but eventually I peel myself away and call another $30 Lyft home.\n\nDAY FOUR\n\n\n\n8:00 a.m. I\u2019m still feeling excited just thinking about the night before.\n\n10:00 a.m. A and I make tentative plans to do it all again next week, as this weekend I\u2019m flying home to visit my parents and some old friends.\n\n1:00 p.m. Mild sexting with A throughout the day. No pictures. If he actually sent me a dick pic I think I would freak out.\n\n8:00 p.m. The giddiness is wearing off. I get really sentimental when I travel. I used to have panic attacks, but now I just feel an icy weight of loneliness and existential angst. I moved around a lot as a kid due to my parents\u2019 jobs, which you would think would make me more resilient in the face of change, but I think it had the opposite effect. I didn\u2019t feel like I could ever figure out who I was internally when I was so busy trying to adapt externally. I still feel fundamentally confused. Traveling triggers all that baggage, even if I\u2019m going \u201chome,\u201d which thankfully is still same town where I went to school.\n\n11:00 p.m. At the airport gate. I\u2019m missing my ex now, because at least I could be completely up front about needing comfort from him. Now there\u2019s no one.\n\nDAY FIVE\n\n6:00 a.m. Finally land. The guy next to me kept me up all night rifling through a bag of chewy Sweetarts. He had a wedding ring.\n\n2:00 p.m. I finally get off the plane and run to my mom crying like I\u2019ve been on a 19th-century transatlantic voyage. She seems confused.\n\n4:00 p.m. My parents grab me pizza from my favorite place. Pepperoni can heal all wounds.\n\n5:00 p.m. A is sending me memes. I feel like once a man has been inside you, even if it\u2019s just fingering, he should be no longer allowed to communicate in cat pictures. I\u2019m turned off, but not surprised.\n\n7:45 p.m. Meeting a bunch of old friends at a bar. It\u2019s an overload, and I almost can\u2019t handle it. I\u2019m so happy to see them, but I can\u2019t shake the strangeness of being back in my hometown with people that know me as someone I didn\u2019t always like. I\u2019m honestly not sure who I even was to them. Also, a few of them are married, and I feel myself questioning if I chose a needlessly hard path.\n\n9:00 p.m. I feel like I can\u2019t think of anything to say, so I drink just to do something with my hands and face.\n\n1:00 a.m. Making out with an old acquaintance, I think only because I said verbatim, \u201cIt\u2019s fun to make out.\u201d This is 28!\n\nDAY SIX\n\n10:00 a.m. I wake up with a jolt of anxiety and quickly take stock of my possessions. I go through my questions. Did I do anything stupid? Yes. Did I lose my wallet? No. My phone? No. Did I text my ex? No. Okay, I\u2019ll deal with the stupid part later.\n\n11:00 a.m. Back to sleep.\n\n2:30 p.m. Flying back. I have a quick cry in the bathroom stall in the airport before I sit at my gate, thinking it will get it out of my system.\n\n5:00 p.m. A is asking when I\u2019ll see him again. I say tomorrow? He says something ambiguous that I know is supposed to be mysterious or coy, but instead it makes me want to scream. Just say you fucking like me. Just be nice and normal. This constantly dangling affection just out of reach is more than I can handle. I consider whether this is a viable relationship, and then wonder if it\u2019s too soon or too stupid to consider that. I just want someone who feels like coming home.\n\n6:00 p.m. Finally on the flight back. A guy is clearly drunk behind me and keeps slamming the airplane window shut. I bet he\u2019s married, too.\n\n9:00 p.m. Home! I miss having a boyfriend who would pick me up from the airport. Even though my last boyfriend wouldn\u2019t actually do that, so I guess I\u2019m mourning a fantasy boyfriend.\n\nDAY SEVEN\n\n\n\n8:00 a.m. I wake up feeling less anxious and more just sad.\n\n1:00 p.m. A is really ramping up the memes today. I think he\u2019s feeling insecure that I\u2019ll cancel tonight.\n\n7:00 p.m. I have to finish one more thing for work then I\u2019m on the way to A\u2019s concrete sex box.\n\n8:00 p.m. I\u2019m getting in the car about to drive to A\u2019s when he texts, \u201cWait that\u2019s tonight? I forgot.\u201d I sit in half-amusement, half-shock. \u201cAre you joking around?\u201d I text. \u201cYeah, Sorry I\u2019m actually in Highland Park. Are you at my house now?\u201d he says. He tries to call and I don\u2019t pick up.\n\n8:03 p.m. I walk back to my apartment. I feel like a complete idiot for hooking up with A, and a complete idiot for almost driving 40 minutes to go do it again.\n\n8:08 p.m. A says he was kidding, which somehow makes it worse.\n\n8:09 p.m. I\u2019m pacing my apartment crying and in no mood to touch anyone\u2019s dick. A doesn\u2019t apologize. He\u2019s confused why I didn\u2019t find it funny.\n\n8:25 p.m. I\u2019m back on the couch with my roommate, watching reality TV for the night. If that\u2019s what guys find funny, then maybe I\u2019m better off being alone forever.\n\nGet Sex Diaries delivered every week.
