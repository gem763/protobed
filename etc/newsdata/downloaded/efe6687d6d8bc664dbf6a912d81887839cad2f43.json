Plagued by Systemic Racism, Task Force Finds", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cWhat we heard from people all across the city is they felt like they didn\u2019t even have a claim to the geography in front of their house, on their street, or in their neighborhoods,\u201d Ms. Lightfoot said, as she presented the report at a downtown library. She acknowledged high rates of violence in some of those communities, but said that did not excuse abuses of power by the police, and that officers must be trained to fight crime while also respecting residents\u2019 rights.\n\nThe panel described the city\u2019s delays in releasing the Laquan McDonald video and officials\u2019 false descriptions of what had happened in the days immediately after that shooting as a \u201ctipping point\u201d for long-simmering anger. But \u201cthe linkage between racism and C.P.D.\u201d had not bubbled up only after the McDonald video was made public, it said. Rather, Mr. McDonald\u2019s death gave voice to years of unfair treatment, distrust within minority communities, and to \u201cthe deaths of numerous men and women of color whose lives came to an end solely because of an encounter with C.P.D.,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cThe task force heard over and over again from a range of voices, particularly from African-Americans, that some C.P.D. officers are racist, have no respect for the lives and experiences of people of color and approach every encounter with people of color as if the person, regardless of age, gender or circumstance, is a criminal,\u201d the report said, adding later, \u201cThese encounters leave an indelible mark.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if there was no arrest,\u201d it said, \u201cthere is a lasting, negative effect.\u201d\n\nThe report also condemned aspects of the city\u2019s contracts with police unions, calling for changes to clauses that they said \u201cmake it easy for officers to lie in official reports,\u201d ban anonymous citizen complaints and prevent the department from rewarding officers who turn in rule-breaking colleagues. The contracts, the task force concluded, \u201chave essentially turned the code of silence into official policy.\u201d The president of the union that represents rank-and-file officers did not immediately respond to interview requests.\n\nThe report calls for dissolving the Independent Police Review Authority, which is charged with overseeing the most serious claims of police misconduct. The task force concluded that the authority has failed to investigate a large segment of its cases, rarely carries out meaningful discipline, and is perceived as favoring the police. It recommended that it be replaced with a \u201cfully transparent and accountable civilian police investigative agency.\u201d\n\nThe report also calls for an expansion of the city\u2019s body cam program; a unit assigned to handle issues around mental health crises; and a new deputy chief at the department in charge of diversity and inclusion. It also recommended putting in place a citywide reconciliation process in which the superintendent would publicly acknowledge the department\u2019s history of racial disparity and discrimination and make a public commitment to change.", "description": "A panel assigned by Mayor Rahm Emanuel says police officers have mistreated people, operated without oversight and lost the trust of residents.", "authors": ["Monica Davey", "Mitch Smith"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/14/us/14chicagoweb2/14chicagoweb2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2016-04-14"}
