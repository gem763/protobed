Nuruzzaman told AFP.\n\nYunus, who is chairman of GC, did not attend the hearing as he was abroad. The chief executive officer and a senior manager at the company appeared at the court and secured bail, Nuruzzaman said.\n\n\u201cHe (Yunus) left Bangladesh before receiving any summons for appearing before the court. As soon as he returns, an appropriate legal step shall be taken,\u201d Yunus\u2019s lawyer Kazi Ershadul Alam told AFP.\n\nThe 79-year-old former economics professor who founded the pioneering poverty-busting micro lender Grameen Bank, has been at odds with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since 2007 when he made a brief foray into the country\u2019s highly polarised politics.\n\nIn 2011, he was sacked as the head of Grameen Bank, in a move widely believed to have been orchestrated by Hasina. He challenged his sacking in the highest court, but lost.\n\nYunus set up the Bank, which co-won the Nobel with him in 2006, in 1983 to make collateral-free micro loans to millions of rural entrepreneurs. The bank is now run by managers appointed by Hasina.\n\nHasina has accused him of \u201csucking blood\u201d from the poor amid allegations the bank charges interest rates of more than 20 percent, and suggested he was responsible for the World Bank pulling a $1.2 billion loan for a mega bridge project.", "description": "Dhaka (AFP) \u2013 Bangladeshi economist and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been issued with an arrest warrant after failing to appear at a hearing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/4c4a8e_muhammad-yunus-who-won-nobel-economics-in-2006-failed-court-hearing-sacking-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
