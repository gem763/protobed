You probably wouldn\u2019t like David Cameron when he\u2019s chillaxed, or in any emotional state whatever. The working title of any shepherd\u2019s hut-based sitcom would be Everybody Hates Dave.\n\nArch Remainers, no-dealers, everyone in between\u2026 not a soul has had a kind word or thought for him in three years. Despising Cameron for the capital crime of countrycide by gross negligence is just about the last thing left that unites us. Even those who wanted their country maimed, and ought to be grateful to him for the referendum, disdain the poor sod.\n\nBut an angry Cameron is especially hard to like, and sullen rage radiates from the section of his memoir concerning certain former colleagues, as serialised in the Sunday Times.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe fury comes with the inevitable icing of self-pity. In fairness, he tries to disguise it. But there, as elsewhere, he is a failure. What was done to him was treachery, as an earlier Tory PM done in by Europe didn\u2019t quite put it, with flecks of foam on its face.\n\nHis poison pen portraits of the traitors are barely worth a first glance. Boris Johnson didn\u2019t believe in Brexit, he reminds the four people in Britain who forget the two Telegraph columns. He spearheaded the Leave campaign, Cameron explains to the terminally hard of comprehending, solely to cement his status as the darling of his party.\n\nJohnson \u201crode the [\u00a3350m per week for the NHS] bus round the country, he left the truth at home,\u201d writes Cameron. All right, soft lad, tell us something we don\u2019t know.\n\nSomething we didn\u2019t know, and therefore more damaging on the surface, is that during the campaign for the first one, Johnson privately floated a second referendum.\n\nA nanometre beneath the surface, however, lies the knowledge that Johnson\u2019s endless capacity for lies, like Trump\u2019s, is factored into the share price. The revelation of a few more from a discredited political ghost will hardly cause a burst of panic selling now.\n\nIt is for his one-time close personal friend Michael Gove, \u201ca foam-flecked Faragist\u201d as he winsomely alliterates, that Cameron reserves the particularly acute anger we project away from ourselves, for being so stupid, and on to those we have massively misjudged.\n\nCameron knew Johnson for an amoral, narcissistic force of nature from Bullingdon days, and hints at a certain residual fondness for the old rascal. But discovering Gove\u2019s defining trait came as a visceral shock.\n\nIn another context (one not involving the ruination of a country), you could warm to Cameron for that. To spend an hour in Gove\u2019s company, let alone many years, without pegging him for a serpentine schemer \u2013 a creature out of time, better suited to skulking around the medieval Vatican in a purple nightie plotting to hasten the Holy Father\u2019s ascension to God\u2019s right hand \u2013 suggests an endearingly child-like simplicity of mind.\n\nHowever staggering that show of naivety, another is more so. Before the referendum campaign, Cameron writes, he hoped for a 70-30 remain majority.\n\nCasually mentioned in blithe ignorance of its significance, that statistic tells the tale of Cameron\u2019s downfall in four digits.\n\nIt speaks to the smugness of someone so cocooned in his own world, so uninterested in other worlds, that the seething resentment of the ignored and dispossessed entirely escaped him.\n\nGeorge Osborne and others cautioned him about the extreme danger of a referendum. He ignored the warnings in complacent expectation of a landslide victory that could only have existed misrouted in utopian fantasy fiction.\n\nCameron outlines seven mistakes he made during the campaign, which is nice, including the refusal to go negative on Johnson and Gove. But he denies it was a mistake to call the referendum in the first place. It\u2019s Tony Blair graciously acknowledging errors in the aftermath of Iraq, but doughtily defending the war itself, all over again.\n\nInadequate though he is as an apologist, as an avenger he is worse. He seeks to settle scores by shaming those \u2013 Priti Patel and Dominic Cummings along with Johnson and Gove \u2013 with no capacity to feel shame. What he may regard as explosive revelations are needless confirmations of what most sentient beings had sussed about this vandalous cabal long before he did.\n\nYou may not like him when he\u2019s angry, but Cameron cuts an even less convincing Hulk impersonator than the current PM, with his faux-deranged, cynical gibberish about busting free of the Brexit shackles.\n\nHe cements his place, alongside Johnson, on the honours board devoted to that definitively English breed of politicians whose judgment is in direct inverse proportion to their intellect. He joins the line, stretching back to Enoch Powell and beyond, of clever fools.\n\nCameron\u2019s bespoke foolishness stems from the classic Sloane\u2019s lack of curiosity about lives alien to his own. The lives, for example, of those without his resources to mitigate the practical difficulties of caring for a child like Ivan; the victims he and his government stripped of dignity and comfort to gratify the vindictiveness of feral newspapers.\n\nAny man with his experience who cannot empathise with the parents of the grievously disabled can empathise with nobody. So it was that by 2016, having spent six years punishing the poor for the sins of the avaricious rich, he hadn\u2019t a clue about the genuinely frightening rage that had built in forgotten corners of the country.\n\nWhen it found expression in a protest vote much less against Brussels than the city-state of London, he was as startled by that as by his epiphany about Gove. If he expects an ounce of sympathy from this non-apologia apologia of a memoir, he has learned nothing since.", "description": "You wouldn\u2019t like him when he\u2019s angry.
