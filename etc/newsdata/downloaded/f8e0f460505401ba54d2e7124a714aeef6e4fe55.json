Making its debut at halftime during Monday Night Football, the final trailer for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker delighted athletes and asthmatics alike. We are all united when it comes to Jedi, droids and wookiees.\n\nThe Rise of Skywalker is billed as the culmination of the sequel-trilogy, or non-ology, or whatever you call the main Star Wars storyline. There\u2019ll be more from the galaxy far, far away (The Mandalorian is just around the corner on Disney\u2019s streaming service) but for material directly connected with George Lucas\u2019s 1977 original, this is it. Or at least until it\u2019s Daisy Ridley and John Boyega as the elder statespeople passing the lightsaber to the next generation. (Don\u2019t think that won\u2019t happen.)\n\nAs the new trailer launched, there were many questions. Is Rey an everywoman, or is she to the cosmic manor born? Will Kylo Ren revert to the Light Side? Will Finn and Rose live happily ever after? Can Poe Dameron be any more dreamy?\n\nAnd how will Luke Skywalker fit in, now he is dead? How exactly will Emperor Palpatine, AKA Darth Sidious, fit in, since he\u2019s been dead since 1983? How smooth will the repurposed footage of General Leia look, since Carrie Fisher died before production of this movie began? And for the hardcore, is that ship in the background really the Ghost from the animated series Star Wars Rebels? (All signs point to yes.)\n\nThis is a JJ Abrams film, so zilch of substance was revealed in this latest promo. But here were the five moments where we made noises that most resembled millions of voices crying out in terror (in a good way.)\n\nAqua-Ren\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hello Kylo \u2026 Adam Driver rises from the deep. Photograph: Lucasfilm\n\nThe third film in each Star Wars trilogy has, thus far, involved a reversal of what true nerds call alignment. In Return of the Jedi, Darth Vader became good. Yay! In Revenge of the Sith, Anakin Skywalker turned bad. Boo! Will this new one be the tie breaker? We hope so. And we hope it involves Rey forgiving Kylo Ren his transgressions and the two of them having a big smooch somewhere with the wind blowing her robes and his wavy hair.\n\nBut until that can happen, there\u2019s going to be some fighting, and it looks like some of that will be on the high seas. Adam Driver looks diabolical emerging from the water and holding his red, cruciform lightsaber like some kind of upside-down trident.\n\nThe Emperor\u2019s New Throne\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ouch \u2026 new throne. Photograph: Lucasfilm\n\nPalpatine is back in this new one. How how how? No one saw it coming, so we should have expected it.\n\nWe\u2019ve yet to see Ian McDiarmid in any of the promotional materials \u2013 is it really him, or his Force ghost? \u2013 but we\u2019ve heard him laugh and now we\u2019ve heard him say spooky things such as \u201cLong have I waited!\u201d (Never keep McDiarmid standing in a queue; he\u2019s terrifying!) It\u2019s unclear exactly what the Darth Formerly Known As Sidious has been waiting for, but we can guess as to the where: a crazy-looking stone throne that would make even Thanos wince!\n\nThreepi-Oh No!\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Droid love \u2026 C-3PO. Photograph: Lucasfilm\n\n\n\nI thought we had got all the Star Death out of the way with The Last Jedi. Vice Admiral Holdo sacrificed herself by hyperdriving the Raddus into a fleet of Star Destroyers and Luke Skywalker evaporated after his Force Projection. Then there was Carrie Fisher who actually died. Couldn\u2019t our tear ducts maybe take a movie off?\n\nWell, no. I just didn\u2019t think it would be C-3PO, the protocol droid who along with R2-D2 has been in every Star Wars movie thus far, to be the one to go. A solemn farewell moment in this trailer makes it seem as if that\u2019s the case.\n\nThe Cavalry Is Here\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Horsing about \u2026 the cavalry arrives. Photograph: Lucasfilm\n\nWhen George Lucas (remember him?) was first dreaming up these stories (and giving them tongue-twister titles such as Adventures of the Starkiller as taken from The Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars) his influences were varied. Yes, he was reading Joseph Campbell. Yes, he was watching Akira Kurosawa. But he was always inspired by cheap, dopey film serials from the 1940s and earlier. To that end, this shot of our heroes on a fleet of interplanetary horses (they aren\u2019t tauntauns!) really brings it all home. It\u2019s fun to see new character Jannah (Naomie Ackie) leading the charge, and outstanding to see BB-8 zooming alongside them.\n\nTurn Around, Bright Eyes\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rey of light \u2026 Daisy Ridley. Photograph: Lucasfilm\n\nEach trilogy is about one person\u2019s journey. The prequels were about Anakin, the original trilogy was about Luke and the sequel trilogy is about Rey. The final shot of this trailer, with the digital sparkle added to her eyes (unless Abrams blinded her on set!), is a gorgeous image of a new icon. And the voice from elsewhere in the room (or maybe from beyond) echoes some memorable lines from the first film: \u201cThe Force will be with you,\u201d says Luke. \u201cAlways,\u201d adds Leia.\n\nExcuse me, someone must be chopping up space onions in here!", "description": "In the final Star Wars movie, Kylo Ren is devilish, Palpatine is spooky, C-3PO pegs out, Jannah leads the charge and Rey sparkles", "authors": ["Jordan Hoffman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db047b021eb2c26b3717a8b7cad6e6175db7f471/513_0_2859_1716/master/2859.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6f31f458177e899aad8655c70ea4b593", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
