Economist says \u2018uncomfortable truth\u2019 is that rally in fixed-income market is justified", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "A price rally in the 10-year Treasury note pushed yields on Tuesday to around a fresh three-year low, while the German bond has been carving out record lows almost daily. And some estimates peg the amount of government debt swirling around the globe bearing yields below 0% at about $17 trillion.\n\nBut don\u2019t call this a bond bubble, according to Neil Shearing of Capital Economics.\n\nThe group\u2019s chief economist, in a research note dated Sept. 3 titled \u201cNo, this isn\u2019t a bond \u2018bubble,\u2019\u201d said the \u201cuncomfortable truth\u201d about the surge in global bond prices, which rise as yields fall, is justified by economic conditions.\n\nShearing makes the case that the so-called nominal yield \u2014 which refers to the coupon or rate that a bond pays the holder \u2014 of government debt boils down to two things: \u201cexpectations for short-term real policy rates over the life of the bond and expectations for inflation. These feed off one another, and both have fallen sharply over the past 30 years.\u201d\n\nThe economist said structural and demographic changes in past decades, including stubbornly low inflation, which affect real yields, and aging populations in the developed world, as well as skittishness to invest by emerging markets in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, have increased the appetite to save and decreased capital investments.\n\nShearing said that further easing by central banks to stave off the impact of a slowing global economy could reduce the desire to save because returns on borrowings will be scant as compared with investing, but it isn\u2019t clear that that will have the desired effect of driving inflation toward the 2% target of most developed economies\u2014 and bursting the bond bubble.\n\n\u201cIn particular, a consensus in favour of looser fiscal policy could both reduce desired savings and increase desired investment \u2014 thus pushing up both real and nominal interest rates and bond yields. But while we wouldn\u2019t rule this out, there\u2019s not much evidence of it happening imminently,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.11% fell 3.4 basis points to 1.469%, its lowest since July 2016, after the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index for August fell to a reading of 49.1, its lowest level since January 2016.\n\nWorries about a recession domestically and abroad have at least partly helped to stoke appetite for bonds, while knocking around major stock markets, like the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.08% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.69%", "description": "\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t a bond \u2018bubble,\u201d says the Capital Economics economist, who says the \u201cuncomfortable truth\u201d about the rally in bond prices is that it is...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GQ285_bubble_ZG_20180918194102.jpg"}
