We can manage the just-in-time supply chains. As for tariffs I don\u2019t think there is going to be any incentive on the part of our European friends to put tariffs on when they have a massive trade surplus with us.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nTo get to no deal, Johnson would have to ignore an Act of parliament which states that if parliament has not agreed to a deal by 19 October then he must ask for an extension.\n\nSecond, for him to suggest it will not be \u201cas bad as you say\u201d ignores his government\u2019s own reports which clearly state not only that the country will face widespread disruption and economic damage but that the North East of England will be worst affected due to its industry and reliance on trade with the European Union.\n\nThird, his suggestion that we can manage \u201cjust-in-time\u201d supply chains is absolute nonsense. If he has any idea what a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d supply chain is \u2013 he could ask anyone at Nissan \u2013 he will realise that any interruption or delay at the border means slowing or stopping production.\n\nFor a prime minister to say this is not just terrifying but also irresponsible given the jobs at stake \u2013 not just because, only this week, leaders from 23 automotive business associations in Europe said the UK\u2019s departure from the EU without a deal would trigger a \u201cseismic shift in trading conditions\u201d, but because it highlights arguably one of the greatest deceits of those advocating for Brexit. That it would be \u201ceasy.\u201d\n\nThe reality is that Brexit is a trade deal in reverse. Britain has spent nearly half a century making trade with our biggest market easier and Brexit is about putting the barriers back in place.\n\nTo suggest that we can simply do this at the stroke of midnight on 31 October without affecting critical supply chains is an absurd con. It will cost billions to the consumer and to industry. It is why Vauxhall has announced it will leave Ellesmere Port just outside Liverpool in the event of no deal, taking more than 1000 jobs with it.\n\nJohnson also said he doesn\u2019t think there will be \u201cany incentive on the part of our European friends to put tariffs on when they have a massive trade surplus with us.\u201d This is rubbish.\n\nIf we leave with no deal then we will be operating under WTO rules and these mean there will be tariffs. In some sectors these are high, like those for cars and car parts at 10 per cent. For textiles and chemicals, they are higher. This will cost billions. Sectoral tariffs in the agricultural sector are highest of all.\n\nIt is also important to point out that while Johnson keeps referring to \u201cEuropean friends\u201d, their goodwill will be killed stone dead if we choose to leave in the most disorderly and disruptive way imaginable.\n\nThat\u2019s what \u201cno deal\u201d means. We will be leaving the club and slamming the door behind us. When you get divorced, things change.\n\nBluffing and blagging your way through as the prime minister is trying to do is the last thing Britain needs at the moment. He says all he cares about is leaving on 31 October. But the North East will be living with the results the day after and picking up the pieces for years to come. That\u2019s why we should not act without the public having the final say in a proper vote where the real Brexit choices can be finally spelled out.\n\nLord Mandelson was European Commissioner for Trade between 2004 and 2008.", "description": "There are a number of analogies that people use when talking of Brexit but by far the most common is that it is like a divorce.
