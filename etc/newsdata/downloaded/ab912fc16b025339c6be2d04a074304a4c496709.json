REUTERS/Carlos Jasso\n\nMarket watchers, credit ratings agencies and investors will pour over the budget proposal when Finance Ministry officials present it to the Lower House of Congress on Sunday evening for guidance on President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s spending priorities for Latin America\u2019s second largest economy.\n\nFinance Minister Arturo Herrera said on Wednesday the budget package will be \u201cextraordinarily responsible,\u201d while the central bank has underscored in its most recent statements the importance that it must \u201cgenerate confidence.\u201d\n\nLopez Obrador has promised another austere spending plan with no new taxes or tax increases.\n\nBut the government has limited room to cut more fat from programs after it reduced funding for several ministries in order to centralize spending, fight public sector corruption and honor a campaign pledge to implement fiscal austerity in its first budget in December.\n\nMexico\u2019s hospitals, the immigration service and shelters for victims of domestic violence were among the services hit by the steep budget cuts.\n\n\u201cWe have to recognize that we have a serious income problem, we have the decision and commitment of maintaining a surplus, of fulfilling the financial obligations of the Mexican state,\u201d said Alfonso Ramirez Cuellar, who chairs the budget committee in the Lower House.\n\nFalling oil production and prices, as well declining resources from income and value-added taxes as Mexico\u2019s economy barely escaped entering a recession, have meant lower government resources, said Ramirez Cuellar, who is also a member of Lopez Obrador\u2019s leftist National Regeneration Movement.\n\nHe said the government\u2019s spending priorities next year will include the key energy sector, health, education and beefing up the National Guard, a new security force created by Lopez Obrador to bring down record homicide rates.\n\nSecurity Minister Alfonso Durazo said he expected the budget to set aside 56 billion pesos ($2.87 billion) for the National Guard.\n\nThe National Guard has been tasked with helping to patrol Mexico\u2019s borders, a move meant to placate President Donald Trump\u2019s demands of stemming the flow of U.S.-bound migrants.\n\nMexico has reduced the flow of undocumented migrants crossing the country toward the U.S. border by 56% between May and August, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Friday.\n\nOther spending priorities will likely include infrastructure projects such as a new refinery, the so-called Mayan Train project and transfers to state-owned oil company Pemex.\n\n\u201cAll of the president\u2019s priority projects will be included in the budget and some will require more resources than this year,\u201d Eurasia Group analysts Carlos Petersen, Daniel Kerner and Ana Abad said in a research note.\n\nALL EYES ON THE FISCAL SURPLUS\n\nOne of the most salient measures of Lopez Obrador\u2019s commitment to fiscal responsibility will be the primary fiscal surplus targeted for next year.\n\nIn order to keep markets happy the primary fiscal surplus needs to be above 0.5% of GDP, since going below that \u201cwould signal a weakening commitment to fiscal discipline,\u201d according to Alberto Ramos, head of Latin American research at Goldman Sachs in New York.\n\nA preliminary budget forecast sent to lawmakers in April forecast a primary surplus of 1.3% of GDP for 2020 and in recent comments Finance Minister Herrera left room for it to be adjusted.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep looking for ways to stabilize the debt trajectory, we have to have some level of primary surplus and we have to look for sources so that income continues to grow,\u201d Herrera said.\n\nRamirez Cuellar, who has been meeting with Finance Ministry officials over the past week to works out the details of the budget, said the number would hover around 1%.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be around 1%, a little more or a little less. It\u2019s still being discussed,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the budget ultimately targets that level, \u201cthat wouldn\u2019t be a disaster, though, since two consecutive years of primary surpluses is good going, particularly for a left-wing government,\u201d said Edward Glossop, emerging market economist at Capital Economics.", "description": "The Mexican government's highly-anticipated 2020 budget will have to strike a careful balance, weighing the realities of slowing economic growth and dwindling resource generation with commitments to fiscal discipline.", "authors": ["Anthony Esposito", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427487682&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF87054", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
