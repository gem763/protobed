Will he somehow appear in an alternative universe?\n\nThat also leads us to the question\u2026\n\nWho really killed Chief Judd Crawford?\n\nAlthough Will claims he lynched Judd, Detective Angela Abar (Regina King) doesn\u2019t believe him and nor do we.\n\nThe most obvious culprit for this heinous crime would be a member of the horrific white supremacist group Seventh Kavalry.\n\nWill someone come clean to the murder? Will Angela get to the bottom of it all? And most importantly, why is Will covering for whoever did it?\n\nWhat\u2019s up with the guy in the mansion?\n\nJeremy Irons\u2019 character is the smartest man in the world and has been living it up in his mansion with his two members of staff.\n\nThe show hasn\u2019t yet confirmed that he is Veidt/Ozymandias, but we\u2019re quietly confident that he is the supposed \u2018dead\u2019 character.\n\nWhat anniversary is he celebrating? (Picture: HBO)\n\nBut what is he working on and what\u2019s his relevance to the rest of the story?\n\nAlso what anniversary did he celebrate with cake and more importantly, why does he slice it with a horseshoe?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow on earth did Robert Redford become president?\n\nRobert Redford has managed to come into power and is president of the United States in Watchmen.\n\nWe\u2019re yet to learn about how the actor managed to get to the White House but we do know that he\u2019s been there for some time \u2013 28 years in fact.\n\nWatchmen is available to stream on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic and NOW TV in the UK.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
