He went 951-975 in 12 seasons with the San Diego Padres and is 1,049-1,047 in 13 seasons with San Francisco.\n\nHe will go out as the winningest manager in Padres history and the second-winningest manager in Giants history, trailing only Hall of Famer John McGraw (2,583 wins from 1902 to 1932).\n\nThe 64-year-old announced prior to the regular season that the 2019 campaign would be his last in uniform. With just 10 games remaining in the season, Bochy will join Connie Mack and Bucky Harris as the only managers to win 2,000 games while finishing their career with a losing record, according to NBC Sports Bay Area's Dalton Johnson.\n\nBochy has reached the postseason eight times in his storied career, going 44-33 with three World Series titles in the process. His three championships all came during a five-year span from 2010 to 2014.\n\nAs Bochy's career in the Bay Area winds down, he appears destined for Cooperstown:\n\nOf note, Casey Stengel ranks 12th all-time with 1,905 wins and is also in the Hall of Fame.\n\nBochy will now have 10 more games to put the finishing touches on his career. Barring a stunning turn of events, the Giants (74-78) will miss out on the postseason, resulting in Bochy's final game coming at Oracle Park against the archrival Los Angeles Dodgers on Sept. 29.", "description": "With an 11-3 victory over the  Boston Red Sox  on Wednesday,  San Francisco Giants  skipper  Bruce  Bochy   became the 11th manager in  MLB  history to reach the 2,000-win plateau...", "authors": ["Kyle Newport"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/828/911/hi-res-b232d41177b69d04ef7cd0a0c1c89b9b_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
