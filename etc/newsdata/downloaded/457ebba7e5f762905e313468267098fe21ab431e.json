This shows which foot is affected and the location of the problem. The patient can then act to prevent an ulcer forming \u2014 shifting weight to another part of the foot, walking around to spread the load, or sitting down for five to ten minutes to allow blood to flow back into the high-risk area.\n\nTRY THIS...

At least one in ten \u2014 around 400,000 people \u2014 develops poor circulation to the legs and feet because high sugar levels in the blood thicken the walls of capillaries (tiny blood vessels) in the lower leg, making them less efficient at delivering blood. This, in turn, makes the healing process slower and less efficient.\n\nThe risks are heightened as those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes often have nerve damage in the feet, so feel little pain and don\u2019t know they have tiny injuries until they become infected and harder to heal.\n\nThose with type 1 diabetes are at greatest risk, but ulcers can also affect the two million people with peripheral arterial disease, where arteries in the lower legs become narrowed due to fatty deposits.\n\nUp to 40 per cent of diabetic ulcers take at least three months to heal and, in around 14 per cent of cases, the wounds persist after a year despite treatment, which involves antibiotics and a plaster cast to take pressure off the ulcer.\n\nA recent trial by Manchester Metropolitan University, the University of Manchester and the Manchester Diabetes Centre tested the insoles on 90 diabetes patients who had already suffered a foot ulcer that had healed, but were at high risk of developing another.\n\nAll volunteers wore the insoles every day, but in half the system was disabled so they received no alerts.\n\nThe results, reported in the latest edition of The Lancet Digital Health, showed those given regular smartwatch warnings were 71 per cent less likely to suffer another foot ulcer during the 18-month experiment.\n\nDr Caroline Abbott, a research fellow at Manchester Metropolitan University, who led the study, said: \u2018Smart insoles could become available on prescription for high-risk diabetics in the UK.\u2019\n\nBut David Matthews, a professor of diabetes medicine at Oxford University, said that larger studies were needed before the insoles could be used on the NHS.\n\nZapping foot ulcers with soundwaves could double the chances of them healing, according to scientists from Lanzhou University in China.\n\nThey analysed data from hundreds of patients and found the treatment \u2014 extracorporeal shockwave therapy \u2014 boosted healing rates by increasing blood flow to the area, reports the Canadian Journal Of Diabetes.\n\nShockwave therapy is already used to destroy kidney stones and treat erectile dysfunction.\n\nBeards may help combat baldness\n\nThe solution to male-pattern baldness may lie in beards. A complete lack of hair on the head in some men means doctors looking to perform a hair transplant have to consider other donor sites.\n\nIn the first study of its kind, researchers at the DermaClinix hair and skin clinic in Delhi, India, compared head, beard and chest hair in transplantation procedures.\n\nWriting in the Journal Of Cutaneous And Aesthetic Surgery, they said that, over the first two months, the survival rates were highest for beard hair (95 per cent), followed by scalp (89 per cent) and chest hair (76 per cent).\n\nHate veg? This might be why\n\nNot eating your greens? You may have avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID).\n\nA study reported in the journal Nutrients showed those with ARFID had no fruit or veg in their top five most commonly eaten foods. In a comparison group, fruit and veg formed three of the five.\n\nThe ARFID group also had higher intakes of added sugar and carbohydrates.\n\nNot eating your greens?
