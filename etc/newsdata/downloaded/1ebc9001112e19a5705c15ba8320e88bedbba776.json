The police is hardly a disinterested party in this dispute.\n\n\"Apple should be transparent and fair in its decisions to remove apps and stand up for freedom of speech.\"\n\nChina is a key area for Apple's business - the mainland is the technology giant's second-biggest market after the United States.\n\nMany Apple products are also manufactured in China.\n\nSeveral other high-profile businesses have been criticised by China for voicing support for the protests, including the National Basketball Association (NBA) in the US, which has seen television coverage in China of pre-season games cut after the manager of the Houston Rockets made a comment in support of the protesters.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Apple has \"caved to political pressure\" after an app disappeared from the store on the iPhone, campaigners have said.
