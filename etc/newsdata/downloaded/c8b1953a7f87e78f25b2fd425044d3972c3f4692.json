The same is true for CNN. Breitbart is spectacularly unfair to its ideological opponents and cares very little about whether it is using facts in a misleading way. Such is the case with CNN. The only real differences I can detect between the two outlets are that CNN occasionally presents an item on, say, the weather, that gives us a brief break from partisan haranguing, and CNN occasionally makes a half-hearted gesture in the direction of inclusion by, say, inviting Jeffrey Lord on a discussion panel that includes seven, or nine, or ten Trump haters. Or at least it used to invite Lord. Note that CNN fired Lord when he sarcastically said, \u201cSieg Heil\u201d in a tweet that accused someone else of being a fascist, which he clearly was labeling a bad thing, not praising fascism or identifying with it. CNN, typically, proved that it was either too stupid to understand how insults work or too cowardly to ignore the bleating herds of Twitter sheep who pretended to misunderstand the remark. \u201cNazi salutes are indefensible,\u201d CNN said in its statement of dudgeon. \u201cJeffrey Lord is no longer with the network.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Kyle Smith", "Nationalreview.Com Cnn-Is-Not-So-Different-From-Breitbart"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
