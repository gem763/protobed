No, the money held up had absolutely nothing to do with Biden. There\u2019s no \u2014 and that was the point I made to you.\n\nQUESTION: \u2014 And you\u2019re drawing the distinction? You\u2019re saying that it would be wrong to hold up money for the Bidens \u2014\n\nMULVANEY: \u2014 There were three \u2014 three factors. Again \u2014 I was involved with the \u2014 the process by which the money was held up temporarily, okay? Three issues for that: the corruption in the country, whether or not other countries were participating in the support of the Ukraine, and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice. That\u2019s completely legitimate.\n\n____________\n\nQUESTION: You just said you were involved in the process in which \u2014 you know, the money being held up temporarily. You named three issues for that \u2014\n\nMULVANEY: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: \u2014 The corruption in the country, whether or not the country would look \u2014 they were assisting with an ongoing investigation of corruption. How is that not an establishment of an exchange, of a quid pro quo? You just seem to continue to be establishing this \u2014\n\nMULVANEY: Those are the terms that you used. I mean, go look at what Gordon Sondland said today in his \u2014 in his testimony. It was that \u2014 I think in his opening statement he said something along the lines of they were trying to get the \u2014 the deliverable. And the deliverable was a statement by the Ukraine about how they were going to deal with corruption, okay? Go read his testimony if you haven\u2019t already. And what he says is, and he\u2019s right, that\u2019s absolutely ordinary course of business. This is \u2014 this is what you do when you have someone come to the White House, when you either arrange a visit for the president, you have a phone call with the president, a lot of times we use that as the opportunity to get them to make a statement of their policy or to announce something that they\u2019re going to do. It\u2019s one of the reasons we can\u2019t, you know, you can sort of announce that at \u2014 he \u2014 on the phone call or at the meeting. This is the ordinary course of foreign policy.", "description": "President Trump has claimed his interactions with Ukraine were not an exchange of aid for cooperation.
