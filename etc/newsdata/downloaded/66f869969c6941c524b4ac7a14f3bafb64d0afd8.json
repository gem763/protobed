Watercolor with mixed-media. (Benjamin Ferry/Gallery Neptune & Brown)\n\nIn his formal portrait of venerable D.C. milliner Vanilla Powell Beane, Benjamin Ferry depicts her surrounded by hats and standing in front of a large mirror. People who try on hats want to see how they look, so of course Beane\u2019s shop would have mirrors. But Ferry slyly includes reflective surfaces in many of the pictures in \u201cHats Off,\u201d his show at Gallery Neptune & Brown. A hand mirror awaits use in one painting, and a rendering of the shop\u2019s exterior treats the display window as a mirror of the neighborhood. Beane\u2019s business is looking good; Ferry\u2019s is looking.\n\nBeane turned 100 on Sept. 13, a date designated \u201cVanilla Beane Day\u201d by mayoral proclamation. Ferry\u2019s tribute is this suite of paintings and drawings, which he began after moving to the Brightwood neighborhood. There he discovered Ben\u00e9 Millinery, whose clients have included Dorothy Height and Maya Angelou. The hat maker herself, though, is the only person Ferry portrays.\n\nThe shop is a traditional sort of place, which Ferry chronicles with old-fashioned realist technique. The paintings are oils and mostly still lifes, observing the hats as if they were flower arrangements or bowls of fruit. These pictures can be appreciated for their documentary value or as studies in color, massing, texture and shadow.\n\nThere\u2019s more dynamism in the drawings, made with colored chalk or charcoal with white highlights. Ferry used the latter media to make the vivid \u201cMagic,\u201d in which the hat maker\u2019s hands are so active that they multiply. In a show of quiet pictures of finished products, this drawing crackles with the energy of work in progress.\n\nBenjamin Ferry: Hats Off Through Oct. 12 at Gallery Neptune & Brown, 1530 14th St. NW.\n\nPhoto by William Colbert Mehari Sequar Gallery Works by Faustin Adeniran at Mehari Square Gallery\u2019s exhibition \u201cDiscarded.\u201d\n\nFaustin Adeniran\n\nNot all of the symbols in Faustin Adeniran\u2019s artwork are easily deciphered, but parts of the assemblage at the center of Mehari Sequar Gallery\u2019s \u201cDiscarded\u201d are easily understood. A pipe leads to a tub of black goo, which clearly represents the ecological devastation caused by the petroleum industry in Adeniran\u2019s native Nigeria. Now based in Connecticut, the artist fills his artworks with oil barrels and other metal detritus, wrapped in fabric that\u2019s frozen in place.\n\nMany of Adeniran\u2019s pieces, all but one wall-mounted, are 3-D laments. He mourns oil-spill victims in his \u201cAnonymous\u201d series, and grieves the despoiled African landscape and the fading traditional culture of his Yoruba ancestors. His new home also is a source of unease. \u201cDiscarded\u201d was inspired in part by American throwaway culture, which is why the sculptures include many bits of soft drink cans. Adeniran cuts and punches single-use containers into glittering bits that he arranges into trash-heap mosaics.\n\nThe meaning of some objects is more specific: A lantern exemplifies the artist\u2019s search for himself, while an antiquated sewing machine stands for Nigeria\u2019s outdated political aristocracy. These are solemn themes to be expressed by clusters of rubbish, but Adeniran gives his concoctions an impressive formality. They\u2019re made of junk, yet they have the heft of marble.\n\nFaustin Adeniran: Discarded Through Oct. 11 at Mehari Sequar Gallery, 1402 H St. NE.\n\nNancy Sansom Reynolds Addisoph/Ripley Fine Art \u201cUnwinding 1\u201d (2019) by Nancy Sansom Reynolds. Laminated plywood & acrylic.\n\nNancy Sansom Reynolds\n\nOrigami artists fold paper into stylized approximations of much more substantial things. Inspired by origami paper, Nancy Sansom Reynolds twists wood into shapes that suggest sheets and ribbons of much more malleable materials. Her Addison/Ripley Fine Art show, \u201cUnwinding,\u201d features two dozen twists and turns of laminated plywood, partly painted with bright but translucent acrylics.\n\nSansom Reynolds, a former Washingtonian who lives in Arizona, bases her gently curving lines in part on desert vistas. Perhaps Southwest landscapes also inform her frequent strategy of coloring the wall-facing side of her constructions while leaving the fronts unpainted. This yields soft, reflected hues and a sense that a crucial aspect is partly out of reach, like a distant view that dips below the horizon.\n\nYet the qualities that seem most central to the sculptures are color and grain \u2014 which the lightly applied pigment doesn\u2019t hide \u2014 and movement. \u201cUnwinding\u201d suggests an ongoing process, however slow, and so do these wooden curls. They\u2019re alive with color and static energy.\n\nNancy Sansom Reynolds: Unwinding Through Oct. 12 at Addison/Ripley Fine Art, 1670 Wisconsin Ave. NW.\n\nRosemary Feit Covey Morton Fine Art \u201cAmethyst Deceivers II\u201d (2019) by Rosemary Feit Covey. Wood engraving, thread, painting on canvas.\n\nRosemary Feit Covey\n\nThere\u2019s a pleasing symmetry between what Rosemary Feit Covey depicts and how she depicts it. Most of the works in \u201cThe Dark Re-Imagined,\u201d the Alexandria artist\u2019s show at Morton Fine Art, begin with wood engraving. The white-on-black images are usually supplemented with painted colors and sometimes built up with thread or small found objects. But the incised lines are fundamental, and apt for conveying such hidden natural systems as a fish skeleton or a network of submerged fungi.\n\nFeit Covey has worked with doctors and scientists \u2014 including at Georgetown University Medical School\u2019s morgue \u2014 so her art is grounded in biological knowledge. Yet the works in this show are not mere illustrations. They attempt to convey the abundance of life, the inevitability of death and the link between the two. In such intricate compositions as the swirling \u201cFish,\u201d the individual blurs into the collective, much as dead things are reabsorbed into living ones. Like a clump of black earth, Feit Covey\u2019s pictures are dark but fecund.\n\nRosemary Feit Covey: The Dark Re-Imagined Through Oct. 9 at Morton Fine Art, 52 O St. NW, No. 302.\n\nSascha Appelhoff & Lena von Goedeke Transformer \"Normcore\" by Sascha Appelhoff and Lena von Goedeke is a site-specific storefront installation at Transformer gallery.\n\nAppelhoff & Goedeke\n\nPrimarily a fashion term, \u201cNormcore\u201d combines \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201chardcore\u201d to denote people who are zealous about appearing ordinary. At Transformer, Berlin artists Sascha Appelhoff and Lena von Goedeke borrow the concept to challenge \u201cthe cliche of the uptight rule-following German,\u201d according to a gallery note.\n\nThey\u2019ve designed a black-on-white installation with simple, repeated patterns on the wall, the floor and cardboard boxes. The elements aren\u2019t flashy, but they\u2019re not as regular as the pin stripes on a button-down shirt. The wallpaper consists of black-outlined shapes that resemble rocks more than Euclidean forms, and the boxes are folded every which way and scattered through the space. \u201cNormcore\u201d isn\u2019t exactly an environment of Bauhaus-like rigor. Indeed, the experience of being inside it is a bit abnormal.\n\nThe show closes Oct. 10, but the gist of it will remain until Nov. 16 as a storefront exhibition, viewable only from outside.\n\nSascha Appelhoff & Lena von Goedeke: Normcore Through Oct. 10 at Transformer, 1404 P St. NW.", "description": "Benjamin Ferry\u2019s exhibition at Gallery Neptune & Brown pays tribute to Vanilla Powell Beane.", "authors": ["Mark Jenkins", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mrBKvgDOaENvx9K3jgYlG4eJxVg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6YHG6EHERAI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
