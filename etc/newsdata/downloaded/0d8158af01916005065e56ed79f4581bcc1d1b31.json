It\u2019s the burial site for many of the people condemned as \u2018traitors\u2019 to the crown and beheaded on nearby Tower Hill.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nFor centuries the Tower was the most important military fortress in the United Kingdom, but over its almost 1000-year history, plenty of ordinary people lived there too.\n\n\u201cDuring the late medieval and early Tudor period the Tower would have been a thriving mini village,\u201d said the Historic Royal Palaces, the independent charity that look after a number of royal landmarks around London, in a press statement. \u201cIt would have served as not only a royal residence, but it operated daily functions as the Office of Ordnance and Royal Mint with its own chapels and pubs, with hundreds of people working and living amongst its walls.\u201d\n\nHistorians aren\u2019t certain how many people lived there at its height, but press spokesperson Catherin Steventon told ABC News that about 140 people live at the Tower now. \u201cWe can imagine more people probably lived here, we minted all of the coins of the realm in the tower so we had mint workers here, more buildings, and temporary buildings, we had more pubs. It shows the Chapel would have been used.\"\n\nThis new find, however, is the first discovery of a complete human skeleton since the 1970s, and the very first time that modern scientific analysis has been carried out on any skeleton uncovered at Tower.\n\nSteventon told ABC News that they are used to finding things animal bones, oyster shells and old masonry in the course of building or repairing structures, but that it\u2019s rare for them to carry out digs of this kind since they do not want to overly disturb the ancient grounds.\n\nThis particular discovery came as a result of plans to install a disabled access point into the Chapel of Saint Peter ad Vincula, which was completed in 1520. As part of the planning process, they conducted two \u201ctrial digs in order to gather information on the chapel\u2019s boundaries and that of associated burials within its grounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink Indiana Jones with all the excitement, just none of the action, hot weather or whips,\u201d wrote Historic Buildings Curator Alfred Hawkins in a blog post about the find.\n\nIn a matter of days, the archaeologists uncovered the remains of two people cut into the medieval floor of what appears to be an earlier chapel located at the site.\n\nHistoric Royal Palaces\n\nThe two people were buried in a way that the Historic Royal Palaces said is \u201ctypical of later medieval and early Tudor burials and due to further materials and artifacts uncovered it seems likely that these remains were laid to rest between 1450 and 1550.\u201d\n\nThe find helps shed light on the history of the Chapel and what life was like for those who lived at the Tower 500 years ago.\n\n\u201cBy looking for marks related to growth, damage, wear and disease we can create an image of how these individuals lived and died,\u201d wrote Hawkins. \u201cThe female was considered to be between the ages of 35-45 while the child is thought to have been 7.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth skeletons show signs of illness and the adult shows signs of chronic back pain. Their growth shows not a comfortable life, but one which is typical of the period in which they lived.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurthermore,\u201d Hawkins wrote, \u201cthere were no signs of a violent death concerning either individual. This is due to the use of the Chapel as a burial ground for those individuals who lived and worked within the Tower of London \u2013 not just as a depository for the traitorous!\u201d\n\nThe remains were reburied in the Chapel at a special ceremony conducted by The Reverend Canon Roger Hall MBE on 10 September 2019. The plans for the construction of a disabled entrance to the Chapel continue.", "description": "Discovery of the remains of a woman and child at the Tower of London shows life of ordinary medieval people.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/alfred-hawkins-ht-ml-191024_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
