Grant, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower, that became prizewinning bestsellers, died Sept. 1 at his home in Huntington, W.Va. He was 86.\n\nHe had complications from Parkinson\u2019s disease, said his wife, Christine Smith.\n\nDr. Smith, a Washington-born political scientist who spent seven years as an Army officer, was a faculty member at the University of Toronto for many years and later taught at Marshall University in West Virginia. His first books were on German politics, but beginning in the 1990s, he became a prolific chronicler of the lives of major figures in U.S. history, and was praised by historians and everyday readers alike.\n\nIn 2012, Columbia University historian Henry F. Graff called Dr. Smith \u201cindubitably America\u2019s most distinguished biographer.\u201d\n\nHis 2001 study of Grant, the Civil War general who later served two terms as president, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and helped raise scholars\u2019 estimation of Grant\u2019s effectiveness as president.\n\nGrant was a failure in business \u2014 \u201cHe was too tenderhearted to be a rent collector, and too candid to sell real estate,\u201d Dr. Smith wrote \u2014 but something of a genius as a military leader who proved to be the Union army\u2019s greatest general. As a president, Dr. Smith wrote, Grant was underestimated by patrician historians and by defenders of the Confederacy, who resented his efforts to promote voting rights for African Americans and to eliminate the Ku Klux Klan.\n\n\n\nJean Edward Smith. (Christine Smith)\n\nDr. Smith\u2019s 2007 biography of Roosevelt, titled simply \u201cFDR,\u201d won the Francis Parkman Prize of the Society of American Historians as the year\u2019s best book on American history.\n\n\u201cHe is that rarest and most welcome of historians, one who addresses a serious popular readership without sacrificing high scholarly standards,\u201d Washington Post book critic Jonathan Yardley wrote in his review. \u201cHe conveys the full flavor and import of Roosevelt\u2019s career without ever bogging down in detail.\n\n\u201cIn sum, Smith\u2019s \u2018FDR\u2019 is a model presidential biography.\u201d\n\nDozens of writers and historians have attempted to the tell the story of Roosevelt\u2019s life, but Dr. Smith approached it as something of a sociological puzzle.\n\n\u201cThe riddle for a biographer,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis to explain how this Hudson River aristocrat, a son of privilege who never depended on a paycheck, became the champion of the common man.\u201d\n\nHe determined that Roosevelt had \u201can incredible capacity for making people feel at ease and convincing them their work was important.\u201d Even under great duress, he could remain \u201cserene and confident, unruffled and unafraid.\u201d\n\nDr. Smith\u2019s 2012 biography of Eisenhower also led to a reassessment of his presidency, once dismissed as a staid period of conformity. Instead, Dr. Smith pronounced Eisenhower second only to Roosevelt as \u201cthe most successful president of the 20th century.\u201d\n\nHe showed how Eisenhower\u2019s experience as the top Allied commander in Europe during World War II made him wary of military engagement, writing, \u201cWar was neither a board game nor a seminar exercise for armchair intellectuals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe greatest virtue of his biography,\u201d Yale historian John Lewis Gaddis wrote in the New York Times about Dr. Smith\u2019s book, \u201cis to show how well Eisenhower\u2019s military training prepared him for this task: like Grant, he made what he did seem easy. It never was, though, and Smith stresses the toll it took on Eisenhower\u2019s health, on his marriage and ultimately in the loneliness he could never escape.\u201d\n\nDr. Smith was not always complimentary toward his subjects. He wrote disparagingly of both President George H.W. Bush and his son, President George W. Bush, for launching hasty, poorly planned wars, seemingly as vanity projects. He was particularly scathing toward the younger Bush.\n\n\u201cRarely in the history of the United States has the nation been so ill-served as during the presidency of George W. Bush,\u201d Dr. Smith wrote in a 2016 biography. He praised Bush\u2019s initiatives to combat AIDS in Africa and to shore up the economy after the 2008 financial crash, but he left little doubt of what he thought of the legacy of the 43rd president.\n\n\u201cWhether George W. Bush was the worst president in American history will be long debated,\u201d he concluded, \u201cbut his decision to invade Iraq is easily the worst foreign policy decision ever made by an American president.\u201d\n\nJean Edward Smith was born Oct. 13, 1932, in Washington. His father was a barber at the U.S. Capitol, and his mother was a secretary at the Justice Department. He developed an interest in history, his wife said, from his grandmother, who read books aloud to him.\n\nDr. Smith graduated from McKinley Tech High School in the District, then from Princeton University in 1954. He was an Army artillery officer, primarily in Germany, and in 1963 published his first book, \u201cThe Defense of Berlin,\u201d about events leading up to the building of the Berlin Wall. Columbia University accepted the book as a dissertation and awarded Dr. Smith a PhD in 1964 in the field of public law and government.\n\nHe taught at Dartmouth College before joining the faculty of Toronto University in 1965, eventually becoming a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. After 35 years, he moved to Marshall University, which was named for 19th-century Chief Justice John Marshall. Dr. Smith published a well-regarded biography of Marshall in 1996 and held the university\u2019s John Marshall professorship in political science.\n\nDuring his 12 years at Marshall, where he taught both graduate and undergraduate courses, Dr. Smith wrote several books, composing in longhand on legal pads. He was also a visiting scholar at Columbia and Georgetown universities.\n\nAmong his books was a 1990 biography of Lucius D. Clay, a U.S. Army general who was a key figure in the Berlin Airlift after World War II and in developing the government and financial system of West Germany, the democratic half of the divided postwar German state.\n\nDr. Smith\u2019s final book, \u201cThe Liberation of Paris,\u201d about how Allied forces drove Nazi occupiers out of Paris in 1944, was published in July.\n\nSurvivors include his wife since 1959, the former Christine Zinsel, of Huntington; two children, Sonja Bauer of Washington and Christopher Smith of San Francisco; and four grandchildren.\n\nDr. Smith was reluctant to rate presidents, but he believed that Franklin Roosevelt \u2014 \u201ctoo talented to be confined by the circumstances of his birth\u201d \u2014 was the most gifted natural politician in U.S. history.\n\nEven when entertaining Britain\u2019s King George VI, he had the common touch, He served hot dogs to the king, but Roosevelt\u2019s mother cautioned him against making cocktails, noting that there was only one proper beverage for royalty.\n\n\u201c \u2018Mother says we should have tea,\u2019 Roosevelt told the King,\u201d Dr. Smith wrote. \u201c \u2018My mother would have said the same thing,\u2019 His Majesty replied \u2014 at which point FDR reached for the martini shaker.\u201d", "description": "His acclaimed books offered fresh evaluations of Grant, FDR, Eisenhower and George W.
