Drag queens are known for their exaggerated makeup: false eyelashes, bold brows and extreme contouring are all commonplace. So, too, is a lot of glitter (and to do Drag Race shimmer sustainably see options here and here). Importantly, whether comical, cartoonish or comparatively subtle, drag makeup is always on point. Here are the tips and tricks that translate from the werk room into everyday makeup looks, according to former Drag Race contestants.\n\nCourtney Act: \u2018Press Sellotape on to glitter to remove\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Courtney Act at the London premiere for A Star Is Born in 2018 Photograph: Anthony Harvey/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nIt sounds like a cliche, but good makeup starts with good skin. The best makeup tip is to drink water \u2013 not just while you put your makeup on, but generally. It plumps up your skin and makes it glow.\n\nYour foundation shade should always resemble your skin tone. Skin comes in different tones \u2013 this applies to all skin colours \u2013 so some people have warm tones, some have cool tones. One thing I often see is orange foundation with pink necks.\n\nPeople always ask me how to apply glitter and sparkles. You can stick crystals on your face with eyelash glue, the same for glitter. The trick is taking your time, using a fine angled brush and being quite precise. Then there\u2019s how to take glitter off \u2013 because if you just wash your face, then you will end up with glitter everywhere for days. Instead, get some Sellotape and press it on to the glitter to remove. That will leave you properly glitter-free.\n\nThe Vixen: \u2018It baffles me that people use tape to draw on their eyeliner wings\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Vixen at RuPaul\u2019s DragCon 2019 in New York.

You can use it for eyeliner, eyebrows, your eyeshadow crease \u2013 so just do them all at once, using one angled brush.\n\nI tend to do my brows using a gold liquid liner, which really adds a pop. I have even done it as a boy, when I have been going out to a club. It baffles me that people use tape or card to draw on their eyeliner wings \u2013 it\u2019s not that hard to draw a straight line at a 45-degree angle! It looks manufactured and just makes me think that you failed art class.\n\nDrag makeup is designed to pop. The minute you walk in a room you\u2019re going to catch everyone\u2019s eye because your features are so exaggerated. I love the transformation that I create using makeup and I love knowing that people in the back row can see every detail.\n\nAlaska Thunderfuck: \u2018You can also use liquid lipsticks for eye colour\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Drag queen Alaska Thunderfuck Photograph: Startraks/REX/Shutterstock\n\nI call my face a Frankenstein face because there\u2019s no one brand that I use on every single area. I use Kryolan and Mac foundation, all different kinds of eyeshadow, and liquid lipsticks from Anastasia. It\u2019s a good idea to play and experiment.\n\nI use liquid lipsticks because they stay put. I\u2019m not one of these dainty queens who has to have a straw \u2013 honey, I\u2019m using my mouth. I\u2019m eating, I\u2019m drinking, I\u2019m talking and I need lipsticks that stay where they are supposed to. You can also use liquid lipsticks for eye colour.\n\nOngina: \u2018You don\u2019t have to paint with all the colours of the rainbow\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Drag queen Ongina Photograph: Michael Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock\n\nYour eyebrows should be at least close relatives \u2013 if possible, twin sisters. When it comes to eye makeup, you don\u2019t have to paint with all the colours of the rainbow. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people who have obviously bought an eyeshadow palette that has five colours, and then put all five colours on their eyelids without blending them. The main technique is to go from light to dark, from the brow bone down to your eyelid. Then just blend everything.\n\nMy go-to lipstick right now is anything nude \u2013 for me that means a muted, matt grey-toned pink colour. Currently I use Sugarpill Cosmetics Liquid Lip Colour in Trifle. It\u2019s easy and it complements any makeup look. If you wear red and it bleeds out, you can look as if you\u2019ve bitten into a red berry, but that doesn\u2019t happen with nudes.\n\nI take as much time on my makeup as I do in creating a look or preparing for a performance and I think that is why drag queens tend to look so good. Beyond makeup techniques, it\u2019s really down to time and preparation.\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK starts on BBC Three on 3 October at 8pm and will be exclusively available on BBC iPlayer\n\n\n\n", "description": "As RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race comes to British TV, former contestants share their makeup dos and don\u2019t\u2019s, from time-saving tricks to lipsticks that stay put", "authors": ["Leah Harper", "As Told To"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52dc08762e38ed327c927a97d4ae471d7efc8b01/557_114_2687_1613/master/2687.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a00a73f5ac2ea593bddedbafadfa9634"}
