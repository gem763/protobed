That girl then appears, riding a skateboard across an astral highway, chasing an ethereal butterfly. Once she captures the creature, the heroine transforms into a masked superhero and sets off on a journey through a pink-and-purple fantasy realm where she chases biker gangs, rides a deer through a mystical forest, and explores a retrofuturistic VR realm. Things only get stranger after that.\n\nThe entire game is structured like an album, with distinct stages that last just a few minutes. The game isn\u2019t shy about its influences. In fact, Swedish developer Simogo posted them all on its website, and it\u2019s an extensive list:\n\nSayonara Wild Hearts is a soup made of pop-culture. It\u2019s OutRun, the \u201cteddy girls\u201d sub-culture, Carly Rae Jepsen, Rez, cafe racers, WarioWare, Bl\u00fcmchen, the 1950s, modern dance, Akira, F-Zero, Space Harrier, Sia, Gradius, the 1980s, Charli XCX, Sailor Moon, Ouendan, Tron, Rhythm Tengoku, Punch Out, and a good portion of ourselves, strangeness, and mysticism stuffed into a blender\n\nWhere do you even start with a list like that? For Simogo, it began with a single drawing. Simon Flesser, one half of the small Swedish studio, had been researching \u201cteddy girls,\u201d a particularly British fashion subculture from the 1950s, that was both flamboyant and working class simultaneously. Flesser loved the look and started doodling different characters, including one wearing a bunny mask and smoking a cigarette. Around the same time, his co-creator Magnus \u201cGordon\u201d Gardeb\u00e4ck, had picked up a new motorcycle, and Flesser was listening to a lot of American folk band Lord Huron. \u201cI guess all of that just blended, and I started to imagine a game about a masked, motorcycle-riding avenger,\u201d he explains.\n\nRelated The 10 Apple Arcade launch games you have to play\n\nSayonara Wild Hearts took around four years to develop, and Flesser says that for around six months, that simply involved experimenting with different prototypes to figure out how to put all of those myriad influences into one coherent project. The game wasn\u2019t always so bright and exciting. \u201cIt started out with a much darker and more mysterious feeling, and we played around with ideas of combining surf rock and taiko drums and Ethiopian influences as well,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot of iterations.\u201d One early version of the game was even entirely motion-controlled.\n\n\u201cI think it has the same philosophy as an album.\u201d\n\nThe final game \u2014 which is available on PS4, the Nintendo Switch, and Apple Arcade \u2014 is a tight, arcade-styled fever dream that is almost unrelenting when it comes to surprising you with new ideas. One minute, Sayonara Wild Hearts is a side-scrolling shooter; the next, it\u2019s a rhythm game where bikers battle through dance. There are massive boss fights and roller coaster-like trips through surreal locations. But it\u2019s all tied together with a slick, minimal art style and frantic pop music soundtrack.\n\nThat pop influence also extends beyond the music and into the structure of the game. Each stage in Sayonara Wild Hearts is brief and distinct, and after you finish the game, you can play through them in any order, as if you were picking a song from a CD. \u201cI think it has the same philosophy as an album,\u201d says Flesser, \u201cin that all levels are self-contained parts with their own little ideas and twists, but together they form a bigger concept. We also didn\u2019t want to use the same ideas over and over, every level needed to feel like they presented their own little tricks \u2014 just like a song on an album.\u201d\n\nSayonara Wild Hearts continues a tradition of unexpected releases from Simogo. The studio\u2019s past work is eclectic, to say the least: there\u2019s Year Walk, a haunting adventure game through Swedish folklore; Device 6, an interactive spy novel; SPL-T, a minimalist mobile puzzle game; and The Sailor\u2019s Dream, a serene experience that\u2019s sort of like a mixed media concept album. And that\u2019s just to name a few.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a silent promise to the audience.\u201d\n\nBut Sayonara isn\u2019t just a departure in style or tone. It\u2019s also a much bigger project than Simogo\u2019s past work. It took four years to make \u2014 Device 6, in comparison, took six months \u2014 and the team had to expand in size to realize the concept. The studio also worked with a publisher, Annapurna Interactive, for funding and additional support. (Flesser says that when Annapurna joined midway through, \u201cthe project really was in dire need of some deadlines and accountability.\u201d)\n\nThis does raise the question of what, exactly, a Simogo game is. If the studio\u2019s output is all so varied, is there a unifying theme or philosophy holding it all together? Flesser says that there is, but it\u2019s not \u201can outspoken mission statement that we have to adhere to,\u201d but rather something a bit harder to define.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is an intentional ruleset we play by, but I think there is definitely a subconscious feeling of needing to stay somewhat within the expectations of what Simogo project is,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I feel it is sort of our responsibility to challenge that, without alienating people who have come to love our previous games. So it\u2019s like a silent promise to the audience.\u201d", "description": "Simogo, the Swedish studio behind Year Walk and Device 6, returns with Sayonara Wild Hearts, a pop album of a game, which is available now on the Nintendo Switch, Apple Arcade, and PS4.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tmynbX7PmWumSPp6iOD7DTymtDo=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19229750/swh_02.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
