Why That\u2019s Actually Good News for Stocks.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nAll of a sudden, the initial public offering market is behaving rationally.\n\nAfter a remarkable first half that saw newly public companies raise capital at a historic rate, there are signs everywhere that a correction has set in. While there was no 2000-style bubble in the first half, there clearly were signs of excess. Jay Ritter, a University of Florida finance professor who tracks the IPO market, notes that the average new issue this year has traded up 25% on its listing day, the highest first-day average return since 2000. But the trend has started to shift: The Renaissance IPO exchange-traded fund (ticker: IPO), which invests only in new issues, is down 15% since late July, after rallying sharply in the year\u2019s first half.\n\nAmid the headlines about IPO disappointments, there is a broader takeaway: Investors have become more discriminating, and that\u2019s good for everyone. \u201cEverything has changed, and nothing has changed,\u201d says Lise Buyer, founder of Class V Group, an IPO consulting firm. \u201cLately, there\u2019s been lots of noise and fireworks, and hullabaloo about direct listings. But the No. 1 thing is that fundamentals have not changed. Institutional investors are pretty darned smart when looking at IPOs, regardless of structure and buzz. Investors will analyze the company, the prospects for the future, and the price at which they\u2019re being offered the chance to invest. That has not changed as long as I\u2019ve been in the business.\u201d\n\nIPO tracker IPOScoop.com counts 114 U.S. IPO pricings in 2019\u201463 have had positive returns.\n\nThe trouble for money-losing customer-facing companies like Uber Technologies (ticker: UBER), Lyft (LYFT), and Peloton Interactive (PTON) shouldn\u2019t be confused with the strong investor interest in cloud-based enterprise software companies, which sport hypergrowth and subscription-based revenue models that make their results highly predictable.\n\nThese companies have low-capital requirements that offer a clear path to profits. Multiple companies that fit this description have come public in 2019. In many cases, their stocks have sold off. Their appeal remains nonetheless, and you can be sure there will be more cloud-based software IPOs to come. Among the class of 2019, Zoom Video Communications (ZM), CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), Fastly (FSLY), Medallia (MDLA), Cloudflare (NET), PagerDuty (PD), and Datadog (DDOG) are all up at least 15% since their IPOs.\n\nA Tale of 2 IPO Markets Among 114 U.S. IPOs in 2019, 63 have positive returns. Here are some highlights. Data as of 9/26 *Reference Price Source: Bloomberg\n\nYet the market has turned a cold shoulder to a collection of flawed businesses that feature capital-intensive models, where competition is fierce, corporate governance is weak, losses are astronomical, and debt loads are high. The troubles in this group started earlier this year with Lyft and Uber, which are both well below their IPO prices. The two companies fight head-to-head in an intensely competitive market, with little chance of near-term profitability and growing scrutiny from regulators,\n\nIn recent weeks, new troubles have emerged. It started with WeWork\u2019s parent We Co., which pulled its IPO two weeks ago in the face of intense criticism about the real-estate rental company\u2019s corporate governance practices, along with serious investor concerns about its business model and valuation. WeWork is now revamping its approach to corporate governance and co-founder Adam Neumann stepped down as chief executive. They\u2019re important changes, but a WeWork IPO in 2019 now seems highly unlikely.\n\nBuyer says her IPO firm remains as busy as ever, although she notes that there are some clear lessons in the WeWork situation in particular. \u201cWeWork will have an impact on companies assuming losses can be unbounded or that governance does not matter,\u201d she says. \u201cCompanies need a credible path to profitability. WeWork is a warning flag, and frankly so is Uber, signaling to companies that the business model matters. Public investors are not going to just stand there with open arms. Investors are being selective and discriminating.\u201d\n\nOne good example of the discriminating behavior is the IPO of SmileDirectClub (SDC), which sells orthodontic devices over the web\u2014the Warby Parker of braces. The company went public earlier this month at $23 a share\u2014after boosting its IPO price\u2014and has since dropped more than 40%.\n\nThis past Thursday, there were two more heavy blows. The first came from Peloton, which sells pricey internet-connected stationary bikes and subscriptions to associated online classes. Peloton priced a much-anticipated IPO at $29 a share, at the top of the expected range, but it opened trading on Thursday at $27, and fell from there. By Friday\u2019s close, the stock was barely above $25. The deal was hampered by skepticism about the company\u2019s substantial losses, its potential market size, and the faddish nature of fitness products.\n\nLater on Thursday, Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel\u2019s Endeavor Group yanked a planned offering just hours after reducing the expected price for the deal. Endeavor is a complicated entertainment company that includes a large talent agency, film and TV production, Miss Universe, and half of UFC, the leading mixed martial arts circuit. Endeavor is growing nicely, but it\u2019s also losing money and it\u2019s heavily leveraged. Had the IPO gone through, Endeavor would have had an enterprise value of $10.2 billion\u2014$6.4 billion in equity, and $3.8 billion in net debt.\n\nFinally, there are the IPOs that are working, some spectacularly well. Beyond Meat (BYND) remains by far the year\u2019s best performing new issue, up more than 500%\u2014the market has fallen in love with fake meat. Ritter notes that for the sixth straight year, about 40% of all deal volume consists of biotech companies, which create almost no buzz among non-Ph. D. biologists, but are promising nonetheless.\n\nPinterest (PINS), a social media business that is often overshadowed by Facebook and Twitter , is up 44% since its April IPO.\n\nGiven recent events, it would be easy to declare the IPO window temporarily closed, and a pause seems likely. There aren\u2019t any unicorns\u2014private companies with $1 billion-plus valuations\u2014with public IPO filings. The consensus is that the supply of IPO-ready enterprise software has dwindled. Expect a light listing calendar in the fourth quarter. The IPO everyone awaits is Airbnb, but that won\u2019t be until next year.\n\nThe other brewing story is the emergence of direct listings, which enable companies to go public without raising new funds. Essentially, companies give the public access to their existing stock. There are three recent examples: Spotify Technology (SPOT) in April 2018, iHeartMedia (IHRT) in July 2019, and one that may shake up the IPO market, Slack Technologies (WORK), which drew outsize attention when it direct listed on the New York Stock Exchange in June. Slack shares have fallen 40% from their first trade.\n\nThat won\u2019t mean the end to direct listings. Buyer, who plays an early advisory role as companies begin their IPO planning, sees direct listings as a clear option for many of her clients, with benefits across the board. For issuers, there is no stock dilution. For venture investors, there is no lockup period. For bankers, there is less work\u2014and smaller underwriting groups with which to split fees. \u201cEvery company I talk to is talking about direct listing,\u201d Buyer says.\n\nThis week, a group of more than 20 venture-capital firms will meet in San Francisco with at least 150 pre-IPO companies to discuss direct listings. Morgan Stanley is holding a similar event a few weeks later.\n\nAmong the most vocal champions of direct listings is Bill Gurley, the longtime partner at venture firm Benchmark Capital. He says direct listings provide a better approach to share allocation, opening the process to every investor. \u201cNo one on E*Trade bought any CrowdStrike shares,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one trading on Robinhood got Zoom shares. That\u2019s the core issue for me.\u201d He says the current IPO process leads to large banks shifting dollars to their favorite clients in the form of IPO allocations.\n\nThere is clear data to show that IPOs aren\u2019t always efficient mechanisms for price discovery. From 1980 to 2018, the average first-day return after an IPO was 18%, according to Ritter. That underpricing amounted to $165 billion in proceeds left on the table, Ritter calculates. Theoretically those funds could have gone to company coffers if bankers had more accurately predicted value before pricing stocks.\n\nSo who will use direct listings? \u201cFounders that are particularly quick-minded, intelligent, and don\u2019t like things that don\u2019t make sense,\u201d Gurley says.\n\nGurley sees a tale of two markets from here. It remains a \u201cglorious day in the enterprise,\u201d he says, as the shift to the cloud continues. But there could be continued trouble for consumer businesses. Investors have decided they want companies with \u201cpositive unit economics,\u201d Gurley says, where adding a customer produces a positive return. \u201cLots of unicorns now have to deal with the reality that Wall Street doesn\u2019t want growth at all costs.\u201d\n\nWrite to Eric J.
