Fallon explained to his audience that, \"This is the world premiere. Check this out. This is Taylor Swift, post-surgery. You were, like, freaking out over a banana.\"\n\nThe one-minute video then shows a drugged-up, post-op Swift attempting to eat a banana and almost having an emotional breakdown when she didn't pick the one she wanted. In another clip, she's eating her banana in bed and her mom tells her to not fall asleep while she's eating.\n\n\"I'm not asleep. My mind is alive,\" she replies.\n\nSwift couldn't believe that Fallon had managed to get in touch with her mom, and then talk her into getting the hilarious candid video.\n\n\"Don't be mad at me!\" Fallon said, after playing the clip for the audience. \"We watched it in the office like 20 times today. I was like, 'Oh my god, I cannot believe this is real.\"\n\n\"I can't even be mad. I'm just impressed that you infiltrated by family,\" Swift said, stunned. \"I don't even know how you did that! No body have my mom's number.\"\n\nSwift's appearance on the late-night talk show host comes days before she's set to perform as the Saturday Night Live musical guest this weekend. Earlier in the day, SNL's Twitter posted a promo for the upcoming show, which will be hosted by Fleabag creator and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge.\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Phoebe Waller-Bridge hosts the show this weekend with musical guest @taylorswift13 \ud83c\udf89 pic.twitter.com/8yN64eq9WS \u2014 Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) October 3, 2019\n\nSpeaking with Fallon, Swift teased what songs she's going to be performing during her appearance on SNL, while still remaining, appropriately, \"a little cryptic.\"\n\n\"I'll do Lover, but in a way I haven't performer it before,\" Swift revealed. \"And then I'm going to do a song that I have never performer before at all, live.\" So we'll all get to see what the songstress brings to the stage when SNL airs live, coast-to-coast, on Saturday at 11:30 p.m. ET, 8:30 pm PT on NBC.\n\nIn August, Swift released her long-awaited album Lover. The following month, in a new interview with Rolling Stone, the 29-year-old \"London Boy\" singer opened up about her decade-long feud with Kanye West.\n\nIn the interview she referenced everything from the 2009 MTV VMAs to West's song \"Famous,\" which reignited bad blood between the pair in 2016.\n\n\"I started to feel like we reconnected, which felt great for me -- because all I ever wanted my whole career after that thing happened in 2009 was for him to respect me,\" Swift said of that period. \"When someone doesn\u2019t respect you so loudly and says you literally don\u2019t deserve to be here -- I just so badly wanted that respect from him, and I hate that about myself, that I was like, 'This guy who\u2019s antagonizing me, I just want his approval.' But that\u2019s where I was.\"\n\nHear more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nTaylor Swift Says Kanye West Is 'Two-Faced' and Dishes on 'Context' of That Infamous Phone Call\n\nTaylor Swift Announces New Summer 2020 Tour Dates, Makes History\n\nTaylor Swift Praises \u2018Bachelorette\u2019 Hannah Brown's \u2018Twirly\u2019 Waltz to 'Lover' on 'DWTS'\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "The singer made an appearance on Thursday's 'Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.'", "authors": ["Liz Calvario"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yqwiRcVLjuXHhfXnFYj.4g--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/22f9b8404f7c3c2e3abe8ff59d00500f", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
