That's compared to 51% of millennials who said paying off debt was their primary motivator for working, while 58% said that retirement was important.\n\nIn a recent survey conducted by Insider in partnership with Morning Consult, 55% of millennials, or those between the ages of 23 and 38, reported that they didn't have a retirement account. And that's a big problem, especially since starting early is one of the most critical elements to saving for retirement.\n\nIn an example previously reported by Business Insider's Tanza Loudenback, two people save $100 each month, starting 10 years apart in an account with a 5% return. The person who started at 25 will ultimately end up with $162,000 saved by retirement age, nearly double the savings of the person who started at 35. However, that saver who started at 25 only contributed about $12,000 more than the person who started later. That difference is just thanks to the power of compound interest, an investing concept in which interest earns interest on itself, snowballing into more savings over time.\n\nJust over half of millennials surveyed said one of their main reasons for working was to pay off debt \u2014 less than the 63% who said traveling was their main reason for working. But for millennials with student loans, credit card debt, and other large debts, it couldn't be more important to start paying those off quickly.\n\nA survey from Northwestern Mutual reports that the average millennial who has credit card debt carries about $27,000 of debt. Thanks to credit cards' high interest rates, credit card debt is some of the most expensive debt you can carry and therefore some of the hardest debt to pay off.", "description": "More millennials say that they work to pay the bills and travel than save for retirement and pay off debt, according to a FlexJobs survey.", "authors": ["Liz Knueven"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4d5c44af909289c65f246?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
