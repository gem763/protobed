(Virgin Galactic Photo)\n\nBoeing says it\u2019s planning to invest $20 million in Virgin Galactic once it goes public, potentially unlocking a new level of synergy for commercial space travel.\n\nFor Virgin Galactic, the deal will provide an extra dose of cash \u2014 but also access to Boeing\u2019s decades of expertise in providing aerospace products and services.\n\nIn return, Boeing will have an inside track to the market for commercial space travel \u2014 which is part of CEO Dennis Muilenburg\u2019s vision for a continuum of aerospace transportation. \u201cSpace tourism, space factories \u2026 that whole ecosystem is evolving, and we\u2019ll be deeply involved in the transportation system that will enable access,\u201d Muilenburg said last October at the GeekWire Summit.\n\nBrian Schettler, senior managing editor of Boeing HorizonX Ventures, emphasized that perspective in today\u2019s announcement of the investment.\n\n\u201cBoeing\u2019s strategic investment facilitates our effort to drive the commercialization of space and broaden consumer access to safe, efficient and environmentally responsible new forms of transportation,\u201d Schettler said. \u201cOur work with Virgin Galactic, and others, will help unlock the future of space travel and high-speed mobility.\u201d\n\nThe investment from Boeing\u2019s venture capital arm is designed to kick in once Virgin Galactic closes a transaction to become a publicly listed entity, via a business combination with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. That\u2019s expected to happen by the end of the year.\n\nBoeing would receive shares in the company that emerges from the transaction.\n\nVirgin Galactic has been working on its SpaceShipTwo suborbital rocket plane and WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane since 2004 \u2014 when SpaceShipTwo\u2019s predecessor, SpaceShipOne, won the $10 million Ansari X Prize.\n\nSince then, Virgin Galactic has devoted $1 billion in investments to developing SpaceShipTwo. The company and its partners at Scaled Composites weathered two fatal accidents along the way, but last year Virgin Galactic finally sent its second SpaceShipTwo plane, VSS Unity, past the 50-mile space milestone.\n\nMore than 600 would-be passengers have put down as much as $250,000 each to take a ride once SpaceShipTwo goes commercial. The current schedule calls for that to happen next year, once Virgin Galactic finishes setting up operations at Spaceport America in New Mexico.\n\nOver the longer term, Virgin Galactic aims to beef up its launch system and offer point-to-point suborbital space trips. Boeing\u2019s investment and expertise are likely to further that goal.\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning of an important collaboration for the future of air and space travel, which are the natural next steps for our human spaceflight program,\u201d said Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of Virgin Galactic. \u201cVirgin Galactic and Boeing share a vision of opening access to the world and space, to more people, in safe and environmentally responsible ways.\u201d\n\nThe two companies promised to provide additional information about the projects they plan to pursue together at a future time.\n\nBoth companies have lots of other connections in the spaceflight market: Boeing is developing its own orbital-class spaceship known as the CST-100 Starliner, which is designed to be launched by rockets built by United Launch Alliance (a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture).\n\nStarliner is expected to start flying astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA next year. It could also fly paying passengers to the space station or future orbital destinations under the terms of a deal that Boeing has with Virginia-based Space Adventures.\n\nLast year, Boeing acquired a small-satellite manufacturer called Millennium Space Systems as a subsidiary. Boeing HorizonX Ventures has also invested in several space startups, including Accion Systems (focusing on electric space propulsion) to Reaction Engines (focusing on hypersonic flight).\n\nVirgin Galactic, meanwhile, has two sister companies: Virgin Orbit, which is working on an orbital-class, air-launch system called Launcher One; and The Spaceship Company, which builds the SpaceShipTwo and WhiteKnightTwo planes.\n\nIn the suborbital spaceflight market, Virgin Galactic\u2019s most prominent rival is Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin space venture. In the orbital spaceflight market, Boeing\u2019s most prominent rival is Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX.\n\nMore from GeekWire:", "description": "Boeing says it's planning to invest $20 million in Virgin Galactic once it goes public, potentially unlocking a new level of synergy for commercial space travel.
