So now, Texas ranks 7th in the country for its share of these young people who are \u2014 right about now \u2014 in their mid-20s, according to the Brookings Institution in Washington D.C. Plenty of millennials, of course, are native born and they\u2019re Latino. Two Texas cities, Austin and El Paso, have among the highest share of young people in the entire country.\n\nOur suburbs are diverse, like Fort Bend County. And those legendary wide open spaces? They\u2019re filling up fast. Our cities and suburbs are densely populated, no place where Republican politicians have ever thrived in contemporary America. In just 30 years, the Texas Triangle will be as densely populated as the Northeast Corridor is today \u2014 from Washington to New York and Boston.\n\nIn less than 10 years, according to data from the Gallup Organization, Texans are less conservative than they once were. Where once Democrats were split between liberal and moderate wings, two in three now proudly wear the label that once could not be worn in Texas: Liberal.\n\nFor years the big knocks by Republicans were these: Latinos don\u2019t vote. And young people don\u2019t vote. Wrong on both counts in 2018. And as we saw, these people are not your father\u2019s Republicans. Nor, frankly, are they Greg Abbott\u2019s.", "description": "", "authors": ["Richard Parker", "Houstonchronicle.Com Opinion Outlook Article"], "top_image": ""}
