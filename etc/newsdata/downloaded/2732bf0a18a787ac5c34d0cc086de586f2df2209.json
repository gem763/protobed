Police said Alamsyah had been \"exposed to ISIL radicalism\", without elaborating.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if either were members of one of the dozens of radical groups that have pledged loyalty to the Islamic State group in Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim majority nation.\n\nThe attack comes just over a week before President Joko Widodo kicks off a second term after his April re-election.\n\nIn May, police said Wiranto and three other top officials were targeted in a failed assassination plot linked to deadly riots in Jakarta after Widodo's victory.\n\nA group of six people -- arrested before they could carry out the killings -- planned to murder the officials and an election pollster in a bid to plunge the country into chaos, police said at the time.\n\nWiranto, the former chief of the armed forces and a failed presidential candidate, is a major figure in Indonesian politics.\n\nHe has long been accused of human-rights violations and for crimes against humanity linked to violence following East Timor's 1999 independence referendum.", "description": "A suspected IS radical stabbed Indonesia's chief security minister Wiranto as he was stepping out of a vehicle Thursday, leaving two deep wounds in his...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/09/wire-19529726-1570696060-967_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
