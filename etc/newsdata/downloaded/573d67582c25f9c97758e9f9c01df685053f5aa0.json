However, it also closed down 0.28% on the day. After breaking out, turned lower and moved back into the triangle, in negative territory for the day. This candlestick is a doji candle and is considered to be a candle of indecision.\n\nWest Texas Oil Daily Chart\n\nSource: All charts Tradingview. FOREX.com\n\nIn contrast, continued its moved lower today (CAD higher) from the bearish engulfing candle put in last week. The pair is hovering around the 61.8% retracement level near 1.3148 from the July 19th lows to the September 3rd highs. Trendline support comes in roughly 50 pips lower near 1.3100.\n\nUSD/CAD Daily Chart\n\nCrude and CAD typically move together, that is, when crude trades lower, USD/CAD trades higher (CAD lower). However today, as crude reversed lower, CAD did not. To better illustrate this, below is a chart of WTI Crude and Canadian Dollar Futures (the futures trade in the same direction as Crude, as opposed to USD/CAD which trades inversely to crude). The correlation coefficient for the two assets is currently +.62.\n\nWTI:CAD Daily Chart\n\nWhat happens tomorrow if crude reverses its recent move higher and trades lower back into the triangle? The Canadian dollar may trade lower with it (USD/CAD trade higher). On a 240-minute chart, price is diverging from the RSI, which is typically a signal of a potential reversal. Horizontal resistance and Fibonacci retracements come in between 1.3230 and 1.3260. As mentioned on the daily chart, support is near 1.3100.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Joe Perry covering: USD/CAD, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
