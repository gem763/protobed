In the eight days since the election, no visible progress has been made toward ending the political impasse it produced.\n\nRivlin attempted to glue the two big parties together in a power-sharing deal, but his failure to do so forced him to choose one man over the other. Netanyahu said after he was chosen that he \u201cwill do all I can\u201d to form a broad national unity government, but Gantz rejected the notion out of hand.\n\n\u201cBlue and White doesn\u2019t agree to sit in a government whose potential leader is facing a serious indictment,\u201d Gantz said in a statement.\n\n\u2018All or Nothing\u2019\n\nIf Netanyahu fails to put together a government, Rivlin will turn to Gantz or someone else. The prime minister will have at least four weeks, and possibly six, to try to complete the task.\n\nThe lack of a decisive victory undercut the aura of invincibility that Netanyahu had promoted. To build a parliamentary majority, he\u2019ll either have to clinch a power-sharing pact, peel off lawmakers from the opposing camp or win the endorsement of former Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman, whose refusal to join his coalition after an April election catalyzed the election do-over. Liberman hasn\u2019t lined up behind anyone so far.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all or nothing for Netanyahu,\u201d pollster Mitchell Barak said. \u201cEither he succeeds and he\u2019s the prime minister in an unprecedented victory or he fails and he\u2019s out of politics.\u201d\n\nIndictment Hearing\n\nIsrael has been gripped by political turmoil since Netanyahu first dissolved parliament in December, then disbanded it again after coalition talks following the April 9 election collapsed over Liberman\u2019s insistence on scaling back ultra-Orthodox military draft exemptions.\n\nThe policy paralysis that\u2019s ensued is liable to continue through the end of the year as diplomatic and regional security challenges mount -- and Netanyahu faces the prospect of being brought to trial.\n\nNext week, Netanyahu will try to persuade Attorney General Avihai Mandelblit to back away from his plan to indict the prime minister in three corruption cases. The Israeli leader claims he\u2019s the innocent victim of a political witch hunt by leftists and journalists bent on thwarting his nationalist agenda. He wouldn\u2019t have to step down if charged, only if he\u2019s convicted and has exhausted all avenues of appeal.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s legal entanglements have given him added incentive to stay in power: He\u2019s been trying to push through a new law that would shield an incumbent leader from prosecution, and the coalition-building fiasco got in the way. His hearing before Mandelblit is scheduled for two days beginning Oct. 2, and Israel television reported that the attorney-general is angling to render a decision sometime in November.\n\nThe Israeli leader received expensive gifts from wealthy businessmen and is accused of reshaping the country\u2019s communications landscape to benefit a media mogul to win sympathetic coverage. If he manages to build a coalition, the distraction of criminal charges could badly hamper his ability to govern.\n\nBack-to-back elections have already held up the Trump administration\u2019s release of its blueprint for Middle East peacemaking and delayed efforts to narrow Israel\u2019s widening budget deficit. Meanwhile, Iran and its proxies in Lebanon, Syria and the Gaza Strip are posing continuing challenges to Israel\u2019s security.\n\n(Updates with president\u2019s comment in third paragraph, Netanyahu in fifth.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Amy Teibel in Jerusalem at ateibel@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alaa Shahine at asalha@bloomberg.net, Yaacov Benmeleh, Robert Jameson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Benjamin Netanyahu was tapped to form Israel\u2019s next government, with no clear indication he\u2019ll be able to pull that off and end months of political stalemate.The decision late Wednesday by President Reuven Rivlin to hand Netanyahu first crack at building a coalition in parliament grants", "authors": ["Amy Teibel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ItL3Zk.trMnL9JEAyvh0cw--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/0c5a2f6d2ff20e5188ae3920700b5ab6", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
