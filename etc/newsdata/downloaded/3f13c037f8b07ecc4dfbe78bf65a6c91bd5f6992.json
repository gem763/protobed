It's not just babies that can make a flight hellish.\n\nSince this blew up quite a bit:\n\n\n\n1/ Adults can be just as bad as babies.\n\n2/ Empathy is important and every situation is different.\n\n3/ Where babies sit can be one of many indicators that help travelers plan flights.\n\n\n\nUltimately, there are more important things to worry about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Rahat Ahmed (@dequinix) September 26, 2019\n\nThe New York Times and other publications discovered that the \"baby map\" is unique to JAL, which displays \"child icons\" for babies aged 0-2.
