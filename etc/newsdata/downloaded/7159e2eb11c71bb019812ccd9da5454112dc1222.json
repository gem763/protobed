Winger has just one goal this season", "language": "en", "text": "A glance at the La Liga table would suggest that Real Madrid are in good shape, with Zinedine Zidane's side two points clear at the top after eight rounds of fixtures.\n\nReal have, however, still faced a considerable amount of criticism for some of their performances and have struggled in the Champions League, losing to Paris Saint-Germain and drawing with Club Brugge.\n\nOne player who hasn't been at his best in the early stages of the season is Vinicius Junior, with the winger having scored only one goal in seven appearances, while he was left out of the squad entirely for the victory against Granada last weekend.\n\nReal Madrid can be accused of expecting too much too soon from youngster Vinicius Junior\n\nIn total, since linking up with Real in the summer of 2018, Vinicius has mustered just two goals in La Liga.\n\nIt is important to remember that Vinicius is just 19 years old and Real still have an immense amount of faith in him, with his contract running until 2025 and Zidane, as reported by Sport, having recently referred to the prospect as 'the future of Real Madrid'.\n\nThere is little doubt about Vinicius' potential, and at his best he can be a nuisance for opposing defenders with his pace and flair.\n\nReal can be accused, though, of expecting rather too much from him too soon, with an unhealthy amount of pressure having been placed on his shoulders.\n\nIn recent games Vinicius has been easier for defenders to deal with as his actions have been rather predictable.\n\nVinicius has endured a difficult time at Real but shouldn't be put under too much pressure\n\nThe high-profile arrival of Eden Hazard may serve to reduce some of the pressure on Vinicius\n\nThe \u00a338.7million fee to bring Vinicius to Real will also have increased the expectation on him to perform and an injury suffered towards the end of last season didn't help his progress.\n\nAt times Vinicius has appeared overwhelmed by the pressure and it needs to be taken into consideration that he can't be expected to perform miracles for Real when he is still adapting to La Liga.\n\nThe arrival of Eden Hazard, who is starting to find his feet at Real having scored against Granada, has pushed Vinicius further down the pecking order at The Bernabeu, but in some ways that could be a good thing.\n\nNow the majority of the focus will be on Hazard, who is much better equipped to handle such demands given his age and experience.\n\nThat could enable Vinicius to be used, for the time being at least, as an impact player, where he can use his aforementioned qualities to excellent effect against tiring defences.\n\nAs a consequence, the starlet, who has already been capped by Brazil at senior level, would be able to build up his confidence and then be eased into the starting lineup once he is ready.\n\nWith Gareth Bale's future uncertain, a place in the starting lineup could open up for Vinicius\n\nReal Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane has used Vinicius on the right wing in some training sessions\n\nWith Hazard surely set to make Real's left wing position his own, there have been suggestions that Vinicius will be more frequently deployed on the opposite flank.\n\nThat will represent another new experience for him, but if he is able to adapt then it could pave the way for Vinicius to eventually force his way back into the team.\n\nVINICIUS JUNIOR'S REAL MADRID RECORD Appearances: 38 Goals: Four Assists: 13\n\nZidane has used Vinicius on the right wing in training, with the youngster admitting that it has taken him to adjust to the demands of the role.\n\nVinicius told Marca: 'It's always really difficult to begin with, but I'm adapting well in my new position.\n\n'I'm training and asking Zidane (about it), who is putting me there.\n\n'Left or right, having the chance to play on both wings helps me at Real Madrid and in the (Brazilian) national team.'\n\nGareth Bale has started the majority of Real's league games this season on the right wing, but the Welshman's future at the club remains uncertain.\n\nIf he is used correctly and isn't rushed Vinicius is still capable of fulfilling his vast potential\n\nIf Bale was to leave, either in January or next summer, Vinicius would be ready to step up.\n\nThe important thing to stress with Vinicius is that there shouldn't be any rush for him to show his quality. If he is given sufficient time then he will surely be able to deliver.\n\nAt Real there is nowhere to hide, with each player's performance in every game being scrutinised intently.\n\nThat has proven difficult for Vinicius to cope with, but if he is used in a more reduced capacity for the time being then it could be hugely beneficial for him.\n\nThe ultimate aim for Vinicius is to thrive at Real and be a key part of the Brazil side at the 2022 World Cup.\n\nHe has endured some difficulties of late, but if he applies himself correctly and is taken out of the limelight for a little bit, Vinicius is certainly capable of achieving both of those objectives.", "description": "A glance at the La Liga table would suggest that Real Madrid are in good shape, with Zinedine Zidane's side two points clear at the top after eight rounds of fixtures.", "authors": ["Jeorge Bird For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/08/19527394-0-image-a-10_1570692606609.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
